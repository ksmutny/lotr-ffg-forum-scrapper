Theres no guarantee the games ending forever, and they regularly do reprints.

I don't know, they seemed kind of iffy even before the pandemic. I think there was a full year between The Crossing of Poros getting announced and when it was finally released. When the time would come for a reprint they never seemed to print enough, underestimating the demand.

Some where before the world went to crap and the art director moving on, he said that new stuff would be slow coming for the year.  Never knew he also included reprinting and keep some stock on the shelf.  There other game, Legion is also seeing a very slow reprint.  Seems like five rings and Marvels is all they care about.
