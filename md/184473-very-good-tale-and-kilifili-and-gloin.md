Just wanted to check with the community on this one. If i use a Very Good Tale and put into play Kili or Fili, I CAN'T fetch the other card (kili or fili) because you have to play Kili or Fili from your hand? Same question for ally Gloin, I would NOT get the resource if i use A Very Good Tale to get Gloin out??

 

Thanks!

Correct. You would not be able to fetch Fili/Kili or get the resources because the cards are entering play from your discard pile and are not played from hand.

Thanks for the clarification!
