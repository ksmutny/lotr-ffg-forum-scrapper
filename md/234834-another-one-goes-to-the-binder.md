With the rythm of "another one bites the dust", from Queen.

Steve walks warily in his room

With the pajama still put on

He looks closely to all his cards

And selects those he likes less

Are you ready

Are you ready for this

Are you hanging at the edge of your seat

Out of the albums the cards go away

Only to meet the binder

Chorus:

Another one goes to the binder

Another one goesto the binder

And another one gone, and another one gone

Another one goes to the binder

Hey, I'm gonna get you too

Another one goes to the binder

Spirit Pippin makes me cry

When I look to the Lore one

Infighting is never worth it

And Brok Ironfist just sucks

Are you happy, are you satisfied

How long can you stand the heat

Out of the albums the cards go away

Only to meet the binder

(Chorus)

Another one goes to the binder

Another one goes to the binder

Another one goes to the binder

Another one goes to the binder

I don't care what Mndela says

Dori and Bilbo now are gone

Lore Glorfindel

Hero Dwalin

Power in the Earth just go to

Share their fate

But I'm ready, yes I'm ready for you

I'm standing on my own two feet

Out of the albums the cards go away

Only to meet the binder

(Chorus)
