So I was just playing Conflict at the Carrock with my new Rohirrim deck (Eowyn, Dunhere, Theodred), and came across a strange combination of effects I'm not sure really works.  So, in stage 2 I put Path of Need on the Carrock, which means I don't have to exhaust to attack, defend, or quest.  Does that mean, then, that I can attack the staging area with Dunhere an unlimited number of times because he doesn't have to exhaust to attack?  Seems kind of broken.

You can only declare one attack per enemy per turn (per player).

It's a fine combo, but not super broken.

In other words, "yes", but you can't repeatedly attack the same enemy if it doesn't die.

Carrock is immune to player card effects.

So you can´t put an attachment on it.

Ahah, good catch Nerdmeister! it totally sliped my mind.

Well, this thread get me considering about building a Forth Eorlingas + Path of Need deck.

I thought this was the case but no one had said anything yet so I was going to check.

Actually just put this card in one of my decks and have never used it before, hoping to see great results.

I was under the impression--I thought I read that on this forum--that the path of need can still be attached to such locations.  I'll have to see if I can find that.

The latest FAQ has a section on 'Immune to player-card effects' that makes clear the immunity to being targeted for attachments. Don't have the FAQ to hand, but it's one of the red paragraphs in it (i.e. new comment). With this rule, thankfully, no need to trawl the forum for the ruling! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Ok, thanks monkeyrama.  Sounds good.  Still, though, Path of Need + Dunhere is a great combination, because it means he can attack every monster in the staging area.

Yup, throw some Spears of the Mark on him and he's golden to rip through a good old horde of enemies! Wanna try this combo now!
