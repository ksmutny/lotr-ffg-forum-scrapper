I have a mostly beat up Dol Guldur Beastmaster in the encounter area. Forced: two shadow cards. I flip first one and it has a shadow effect (Pursued by Shadow, and ain't that right!) But there is a When Revealed above it. Do both actions occur?

I know. A newb question, and I've got plenty more.

No, just resolve the Shadow effect, ignore the When Revealed text.

And just to add one more question. If I am not making engagement checks: JAtA. 2B. I can decide to leave the enemy in staging, until they build up and overwhelm me, not thatI would,but I can justnot engage, right?

And 3B: I can pick and choose who I want to deal with, and of course still get overly thrashed. Right?

first: yeah, you may choose to let enemies build up in stage 2 of JDtA if you wish.

 

second: On stage 3B all enemies make engagement checks as per usual.  Stage 2B is now out of play, so the text that was previously canceling engagement checks is now gone, done for!  So if you have let the staging area build up while you cruised happily down the anduin, it is now time to have some fun as you reach the shore and find a horde of enemies awaiting you...

Okay. First, thanks so much. This aggravating game is really fun.

Second, if I turn that question around,I can still engage as many enemy as I wish on 2B? We're just not looking at engagement numbers versus mythreat.

Now. Do I have that right?

I just started but I've seen you a lot on the boards. Rest assured that many of us appreciate it.

Dizpatcher.

Each player only has the option to engage 1 enemy in the staging area before the engagement checks are made. Stage 2B removes the forced engagement checks but does not remove the limitation that each player is only allowed to engage 1 enemy voluntarily.

Bummer. Okay. Thank you.

There are some cards that allow you to engage enemies outside the normal workings. Son of Arnor is an example of such.
