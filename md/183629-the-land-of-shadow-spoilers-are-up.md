Awesome cards! I didn't expect to see characters from the first half of the Two Towers in this box, but I certainly appreciate it. Gamling is amazing! I'm loving that art.

When the battle of pelennor fields comes, Rohan faction will be super powerful. Love the rohan cards, and also the hidden thematic homerun, how Rohan started out kind of weak through the cycles, but really gathers around their king as the game progresses. 

## 5 [Gizlivadi on July 30, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/183629-the-land-of-shadow-spoilers-are-up/?do=findComment&comment=1709695)

Gamling is precisely what the deck (spirit-tactics Rohan) needed. You always end up with an empty hand thanks to Theoden's discount, and the lack of card draw in those spheres means you won't be able to play more allies consistently. Gamling takes care of that, thematically enough. It's kind of a bummer that you have to exhaust him, but when you have a deck full of Escort from Edoras, Westfold Horse breaker, Helm! Helm! Ride to Ruin, Hama, etc, he could really be invaluable. I really feel that now the Rohan trait has come full circle. Maybe it's not as powerful as Silvan or other such decks, but it really feels powerful now.

 

Ents are bonkers, and will be even more bonkers in the future. Glad to see that trait developed.

 

I wonder how effective this whole "higher engagement threat" mechanic will be in non-hobbit decks. The staff will be awesome for Sam obviously, but for the rangers of Ithilien... I don't know. With a starting threat of at least 20 with Faramir and Damrod (again, I'm thinking in solo), that mechanic seems like it could fizzle easily. We will have to see I guess.

So does Gamling work with allies that are killed, or only discarded with Ride to Ruin or something similar?  Either way, he's huge for Rohan.

 

I'm also super excited about staff of Lebethron!  It's effectively a 1 cost burning brand for Sam.

I think i'm most excited for Snowmane.  Really going to push Theoden into a top tier hero spot with his attachments.  Not necessarily the hardest part but maybe the trickiest part was finding how to best use all his good stats (get some extra willpower, attack with 3, defend with sentinel) and the resolution normally involved either using an unexpected courage (who can now more freely be played on other heroes) or the resource intensive steed of the mark.

When a character is destroyed, it is discarded, so Gamling would work either way.

Are we sure about that? As far as I know, destroyed =/= discarded, even though they go to the discard pile.

Gizlivadi is correct. A card is only "discarded" if a card effect specifically says "discard". Destroyed cards are placed in the discard pile. See the FAQ.

## 11 [tricil on July 30, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/183629-the-land-of-shadow-spoilers-are-up/?do=findComment&comment=1709806)

Unfortunately, I agree with Ecthelion and Gizlivadi. The ruling was just updated in the latest FAQ (1.7):

 

"(1.48) Discarding cards vs placing cards in the discard pile.
When a character is destroyed, or an event card is played,
it is placed in the discard pile. This is not the same as
being “discarded.” Cards are only discarded when a card
effect instructs a player to discard a card."
 

This obviously makes Gamling a bit less of a Rohan stable but he will still work nicely with Ride to Ruin, Hama, etc.

You can also replace the riddermark finest by other Rohan allies which have a discard effects.

Can anyone confirm the availability of Land of Shadow at Gencon? TC's photos show the player cards lying on a table, which seems to imply that they obtained a copy but its not yet clear to me that the product is actually on sale at the Con.

Learned this evening that my GenCon agent successfully procured me a copy of Land of Shadow from the FFG booth.  For the price of a beer I should be opening LoS sometime next week! Many thanks to the community for confirming the availability of the LoS at GenCon!

Oh thank you very much PsychoRocka! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

 

Very interesting cards indeed!

Not too impressed with the Ent TBH (looks good but quest-dependant ofc) as far as power is concerned but masterful design IMO, it's a very flavorful card.

Snowmane is exactly what Theoden was asking for (hello Steed of the Mark, nice to see you even more useless :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]), borderline on Gamling since he is very expensive; probably worth the effort but I'd really have to play with it.

Surely all those additions make Rohan a much more interesting trait to explore/play with.

The staff is nice too, good to see they're giving players more help with Shadows, since there's a lot of nasty effects around since the HoN/AtS cycle.

There has to be a few cards missing. The rules insert says 34 player cards +3 heroes. One of those is a boon, so that leaves 33 cards, or 11 unique player cards. Only 9 are shown here. I just find it odd that there is only one Tactics card. Assuming there are some left to spoil, maybe the missing cards is a Tactics card and the last a Fellowship card?

Fellowship hero is counted as a player card I believe and there is also the Fellowship event "Speak your Promise" or whatever it is called. Don't think there are any others unfortunately.

That's true. Forgot about that. And leadership definitely made up for it in this Saga box haha. tactics is my favorite sphere so I'm always looking for goodies.

I am glad they were not afraid to skew the sphere distribution. I was expecting Snowmane to appear in the box V however. Previously they had stuck to the characters (or horses) mentioned in the text, whilst I don't think there is a mention of either Gamling or Skinbark in Book IV. Still, it was probably ever going to be so because of the lack of characters in Books IV and VI. I hope to see Eagles in the saga now. And I feel there will be only one Lore or Spirit card in the next box.
