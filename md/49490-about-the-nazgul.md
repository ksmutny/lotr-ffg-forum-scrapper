# [About the Nazgul](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49490-about-the-nazgul/)

Quick question. The Nazgul that's used on the third quest states something like "when a shadow effect resolves discard a character". Several questions about this:

- If the only character I have is the only one that's able to defend (and I've chosen him to do so), what happens? He is discarded and the attack goes undefended? It still counts for defense?

- On the other hand, if the Nazgul is dealt a card without a shadow effect, is his ability triggered or not? I saw in the FAQ that if you cancel the shadow effect with a card then his ability is not triggered.

Thanks,

Javier

The character is discarded and the attack goes undefended.

If there is no shadow effect, then the Nazgul's ability doesn't trigger.

Well, I think it says something like when a shadow card is dealt...I am at work now and I cannot look that up.  Can somebody please clarify that for us?

But I think the ability triggers regardless of any shadow effect.

If there's no shadow effect, the ability doesn't trigger.

It's covered by the FAQ:

Q. If I cancel the Shadow effect on a card dealt to the
Nazgûl of Dol Guldur (CORE 102), is the effect still
considered to have resolved, making me discard a
character?
A: No. Resolving an effect means that the effect
triggered and resolved to the fullest extent possible.
Canceling the effect will prevent the Nazgûl of Dol
Guldur's ability from triggering, just as if the card had
no Shadow effect to begin with.
