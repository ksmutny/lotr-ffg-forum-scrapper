Hi I was wondering what specifically I would need to run a four player game. In the core rulebook it just says another core set is needed. Is it just for threat dials or are there cards that I would need as well?

Technically you can even play with 4 players and only one core set, as long as you have a means to track your threat with dice or similar. Every quest in the game can be played with 4 players, so you just need enough player cards for everyone.

We have played an entire saga campaign with just one core. It helped that the other players eventually downloaded an android threat tracker app (wish we had one for apple too haha) but it's just the extra threat dials and tokens that help

Awesome thank you! I just wanted to be sure it was just a threat dial thing and card availability
