I think BGG is best suited place for this kind of stuff. Be sure to post link to it here.

Post it in Variants section at BGG. The community there is quite keen on variants and giving feedback.

post it in a Print and play or prototype forum of BGG. Do not post in variants if it is a original game... only if it is a rule modification to a existing game.

considering the IP is a closely held property worth millions. I wouldn't publish it unless you have a bunch of good lawyers.

If you wish to make money out of it you need to look into licensing it or changing the theme. Otherwise just release it as a free Print and Play game. Where you post the rules and all the art resources needed for people to build there own version.
