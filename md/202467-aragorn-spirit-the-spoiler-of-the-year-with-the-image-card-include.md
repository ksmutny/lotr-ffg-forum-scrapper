I notice he is too busy being romantic to be a Sentinel.

 

Edit: Actually, Tactics Aragorn isn't a sentinel either, so my comment isn't as funny as I thought.

You got me xD

 

With the 5th Lotr Saga Box on it's way it is even quite possible to get an other Aragorn Version, making your post much more believable :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I bet he breaks his sword again that night...

What was his nickname?.... a-stride-her? Something like that...

Ps: Sorry, just joining in the "spirit"
