 I just purchased the game this week, and am looking for other local players.  I'll be teaching the game to some friends, but not sure if they will buy their own copy.

If you live around Pittsburgh, reply here so we can meet up.

Thanks,

Don

Sounds good.  Send me an e-mail offline, and we can work out some details.

Anyone else?
