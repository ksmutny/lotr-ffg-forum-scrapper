Let's say I have a Leaf Brooch and want to play a card like Out of Sight that already has Secrecy of 3 (with a normal cost of 5) Would the brooch allow me to treat it as secrecy 4? I thought I saw a rule somewhere that said keywords with quantities such as Doomed and Archery would just stack.

Â 

Also, would this allow three brooches among your heros to potentially reduce the total cost of the first event you played by 3?

Yes, they all stack.
