I wish I could have been there at GenCOn...nice article, although I guess the official anouncement of the new Deluxe Expansion stole its thunder ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

 

Definitely like the Night mechanic and its effect on encounter cards though!

I know what you mean; it's pretty crazy.  

I looked up some completed listings to see what people are actually paying, and many ranged from $35-55, but one sold for $85!  Talk about a severe lack of patience!  I guess my perspective is different than someone who actually has a good amount of money to spend, though.

 

On a side note, I wonder when this and the Black Riders will be available to purchase through game stores?

I wonder how many allies will die to save this Darwin Award Nominee Derufin?

My buddy spent $39 on it, but he was AT gen con, got to play the thing, yet missed the boat buying the scenario because he was busying being a Game Master for his RPG of choice for the first 3 days. 

 

His logic was simply. I'm willing to spend 25 extra bucks for several months of enjoyment in playing this before it comes out.

 

I don't think he would have done it for the last two scenarios but he really fell in love with the Stone of Erech.

Well that's a good sign to be sure.

-_- [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sleep.png] I wonder where I left my brain yesterday...

My friend got his set in. Called me, arranged a time to play, came over. When he arrived he looked grim.

Hahaha it seems he got distracted and left his 40 dollar expansion on top of his car and didn't notice till he drove over the whole box. Hahahahahaha

Oh man, we can still play by sleeving them but most of the cards in the pack have either tire or gravel imprint

Hahahahaha

Wow.  What a horrible event!  Well, maybe buy some DragonShield sleeves to sleeve them, as they are quite thick and I doubt you would be able to notice the marked cards.
