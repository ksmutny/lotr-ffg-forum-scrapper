In the new Wilds set, there's a "Dragon Breath" condition on the dragon that says, "Forced: When attached enemy attacks you, deal 1 damage to each character you control."

If I have 1 ally with 1 life that I wanted to defend against the attack, does the attack kill the ally, and then my heroes all take 1 damage? Or does the enemy apply the 1 wound to everyone first, thereby killing the ally before he can block, and cause me to take the attack undefended? (Thereby vaporizing a hero.)

I would think the damage happens when the enemy declares his attack, so before a defender is declared at all.
