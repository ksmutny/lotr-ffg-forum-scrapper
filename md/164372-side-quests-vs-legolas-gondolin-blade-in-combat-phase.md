# [Side Quests vs Legolas, Gondolin Blade in combat phase](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/164372-side-quests-vs-legolas-gondolin-blade-in-combat-phase/)

Just want to see what others think about this.  The Lost Realm insert has this to say about Side Quests on pg. 2-3 (I bolded the most relevant part:

 

"At the beginning of each quest phase, if there are one or more side quests in the staging area, the first player may choose one to be the “current quest” until the end of the phase instead of the quest card that is currently active via the quest deck. While a side quest is the current quest, any progress that the players make is placed onto that side quest and any card effects that target the “current quest” target that side quest. Progress must still be placed on the active location before it can be placed on a side quest. Any progress that is made beyond the current quest’s total quest points is discarded; do not place progress on any other quest card in play."

 

If you fail to clear a side quest during the questing phase, can you use Legolas or Gondolin Blade during the combat phase to place progress on it?  It looks like a pretty clear "no" because the text says the side quest will be the current quest only "until the end of the phase."  Unless I am missing something?

I agree.

I am wondering if you clear the side quest via a hands upon the bow on Legolas during the quest phase. Do the questing revert to the normal quest or are we stuck for the reminder of the phase to be in the side quest however gone ?

oo, also a good question.  I would suppose it reverts to the regular quest, but that is just a guess!

Sounds right, as the rules specify "until the end of the [quest] phase".

Edit: sorry, this is the wrong way round - "until the end of the [quest] phase" indicates that it does NOT revert to the regular quest.

Maybe I'm misunderstanding, but I read it this way: if you pick a side quest and then clear it before the end of the phase, it's still the quest until the end of the phase.

Hmm I would argue that something that is not in an in-game state can no longer be the active quest.

An example to mirror, if not perfectly: If you clear the active location in a similar fashion, then there is no longer an active location and any progress will go directly to the active quest.

Yes I do agree here if side quest is past the current quest in quest deck become active straight away. Even if there is second side quest in staging area still next active quest is current quest of the quest deck! That how I read the rules

I think that this is the intuitive way to play, however, it would be nice to have some clarifications from Caleb on this ... Questing on one side quest then "Legolasing" an enemy through hands upon the bow, clearing the side quest : now switching active quest to what ? No quest ? Other side quest ? Scenario quest ? Do we have a choice ?

I'll send a question in through the official channel.

I would say that it is more a point that the Encounter Quest is set to a passive mode, awaiting a time when there is no Side Quest to take the progress before becoming active again; which could come from both end-of-the-quest-phase or from the removal of the Side Quest, and thus the special rules following the Side Quest.

I will concede that an official ruling would be much appreciated though.

Verdict is in: no reversion!  Even if you clear a side quest with Hands Upon the Bow + Legolas, or Ravens of the Mountain, etc., it remains the 'current quest,' and any progress you make as a result from questing is lost!

 

Official answer:
 
question was: "I was wondering specifically what would happen if Legolas (+Hands Upon the Bow, for example) or Ravens of he Mountain were used to clear the side quest during the quest phase.  Would the scenario quest card become the active quest, or would there be no active quest on which to place progress as a result of questing?"
 
 
and Caleb's answer:
 
"The rules for side quests state that if you choose a side quest to be the active quest, it remains the active quest until the end of the quest phase, and any excess progress made after defeating a side quest is discarded. So, if you defeated a side quest before resolving the quest, all the progress you made from questing successfully would be discarded. This is important to the identity of side quests: You must dedicate at least 1 entire quest phase to defeat a side quest. During the phase that your heroes are adventuring on a side quest, they cannot make any progress on the main quest."
Cheers,
Caleb

Thanks GrandSpleen : counter-intuitive for me, but though perfectly in lines with the wording.

So I think is good choice of rule from Caleb. Good to know now for sure. Thanks

And good explanation for why the design is as it is.   Thanks, Caleb!

When you have chosen a side quest, and you are in combat phase, where go the legolas' tokens finally? to side quest or normal quest?

normal quest, the side quest only remains the current quest until the end of the quest phase per the rules insert
