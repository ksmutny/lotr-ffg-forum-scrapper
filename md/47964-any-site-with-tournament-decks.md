I'm trying to build a deck and wanted to check some sites with options and tournament decks, does anyone have a link?

What I'm basically looking for is some decklists so I can build a single player deck to play against the scenarios myself with some guidance...

Great, thank you! I've read the tournament deck rules in the rulebook, it seems fun =)
