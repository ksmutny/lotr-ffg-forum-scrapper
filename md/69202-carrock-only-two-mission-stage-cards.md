So I opened my new Carrock AP and it only has mission cards 1A/B and 2A/B.  There is no third card.  Is that right?  I suppose the game can end when you kill all the trolls, but I've not seen another AP with only two stages. 

Am I missing the third stage?

Much thanks!

The Hills of Emyn Muil had only one stage.  It's correct that this one has only 2 stages so don't worry, you're not missing cards :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
