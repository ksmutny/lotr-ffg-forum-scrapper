It just occurred to me, that those two guys together can perform spectacular things... Just think ot it: 

 

They can play first 2-costed Rohan ally for free each turn. And out of 6 2-costed Rohan allies, only one is not Spirit or Lore. If you consider Guthlaf, then two.

 

They can play any 3-costed Rohan ally on the first turn even in a tri-sphered deck.

 

And if you happen to have the Keys of Orthanc, you're getting a resource out of it :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Yup.  Even the 3-cost Rohan allies Warden of Helm's Deep and Horseback Archer are well within reach.  The Warden is already a great ally.  That archer has lost value over time, but at a cost of 1?  Gold.

I put a deck together with Theoden, Grima, and Eowyn for Escape from Dol Guldur. It's great. No matter who gets captured you still generate at least 3 "effective" resources from the start. And if your big quester (Eowyn) gets captured then you are generating 4, with access to both spheres.

Throw in Gamling, Escort from Edoras, Gleowine and Keys of Orthanc. You can play the Escort for free and get it back with Gamling and a free resource from doomed as well. Gleowine helps to set the combo up.

 Maybe replace Eowyn with Glorfindel or Galandriel to keep threat low?

I'm not sure I would consider it "free". You pay 0 resources, but you are consuming your -2 cost reduction every turn that could be spent on something else. For example two West Road Travellers give the same willpower and will stick around every turn, freeing up your cost reduction for other things.

The first half of my solo saga I played with Grima, Theoden, and Merry. It worked really well, especially if I got Keys of Orthanc in my opening hand. I could usually drop around 6 cards in the first two turns.

It kinda fell apart after I fed Theoden to the Balrog, though...

## 7 [FetaCheese on September 12, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/188119-spirit-theoden-grima/?do=findComment&comment=1790580)

But with 1 cost reduction from Theoden, Grima's reduction and 1 resource gained from Keys of Orthanc you are actually benefiting. 

 

+3 resources per turn, +1 keys of orthanc, -2 cost reduction= total worth 6 resources, no?

Grima's actually one of my favorite solo heroes, whether it's with Theoden/Rohan, Damrod/traps, O Lorien/Silvan, Treebeard/Ents, he is just so good at making a deck run faster.

I've only played Gríma in a solo deck with Aragorn and Glorfindel, using mostly ranger and trap stuff and OHaUH Gandalf. It was really good, but I'm interested in other builds. Which third hero do you use in Grima with Theoden?

## 10 [John Constantine on September 12, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/188119-spirit-theoden-grima/?do=findComment&comment=1791076)

As Rohan has a lot of high cost Spirit stuff, the second Spirit hero is what comes to my mind. To mitigate threat boost, it would be nice fo that hero to have some sort of threat reduction. Glorfindel/Galadriel/Merry.

one thing that I have heard considered and that I think would be OP is spiraden, grima and theodred.  basic idea is that you get at least three extra resources a round, four with keys

## 12 [soulred on September 13, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/188119-spirit-theoden-grima/?do=findComment&comment=1791678)

Grima is quickly becoming one of my favorite heroes. Currently I'm using him with Lore Aragorn and Frodo and seeing how many of the current quests I can get through with them. Use Frodo to block attacks while building up an army of allies with Grima's ability to play cards on the cheap. Once the board is under control, use Aragorn's reset ability to set your threat back to a manageable level. Works great!

Galandriel!

 

Use her in early game to counter Grima's threat gain and draw Therugrim and Nenya. Use Nenya for early questing and once you have established your board, exhaust Galadriel during the combat phase to buff Theoden. He may now attack for +6 ((edit: Nenya is a quest action so this won't work :/ )). Meanwhile you have effectively 6 resources to spend each round (3+1 from Keys of Orthanc+2 cost reduction). All for 30 threat! Drop Escorts from Edoras and ally Hamma in and out at will and get them back with Gamling. Stick Snowmane and a couple copies of Unexpected Courage in there along with mirror of Galandirel to get the Gamling Party up ASAP.

 

What do you guys think?

 

Edit:

 

Here's an untested list:

 

Galadriel

Gríma

Théoden

 

25 Allies

 

2x [Escort from Edoras]

3x [Gamling]

3x [Háma]

3x [West Road Traveller]

3x [Westfold Horse-Breaker]

2x [Westfold Horse-breeder]

2x [Gléowine]

2x [Quickbeam]

2x [Warden of Healing]

3x [Gandalf]

 

15 Attachments

 

3x [Ancient Mathom]

2x [Herugrim]

3x [Mirror of Galadriel]

1x [snowmane]

3x [Keys of Orthanc]

3x [Nenya]

 

10 Events

 

3x [A Test of Will]

1x [Dwarven Tomb]

3x [Elrond's Counsel]

3x [Daeron's Runes]

 

 

Maybe take out 1 copy of Hamma or Gamling and squeeze in 2 UC in there.

Nenya is a quest action, sadly. I thought about the same combo when Herugrim came out, but alas.

I still agree that Galadriel is a good idea for a Rohan deck. You get one extra action out of the allies before they promptly discard themselves.
