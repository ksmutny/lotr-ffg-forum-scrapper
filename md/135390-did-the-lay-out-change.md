I'm autistic, so i can't handle change and I want to know if this is a bug of or a change of the forumlay-out.

It's like all white and black instead of the nice brown colour.

I'm getting the same thing.

Brown color? Wasnt it a dark blue/grey?

## 6 [gandalfDK on February 19, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/135390-did-the-lay-out-change/?do=findComment&comment=1455912)

Hmmm I thought it brown.... At least much more a comfort to the eyes!

Are you daltonic as well as autistic?

Not as conspicuous at work. Took approved.

Sweet new layout! Is it just for mobile devices or everyone? I'm on my phone

## 10 [gandalfDK on February 19, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/135390-did-the-lay-out-change/?do=findComment&comment=1455968)

Well, actually I'm not autistic but imo every person has a little autism in him/her. And I don't know what daltonic is.

The new default font size is horrendously large and the site is blinding. 0/10

This is phone too

This time Epi is my man

Looks like a weddev at FFG discovered twitter bootstrap or some other responsive UI.

 

Hopefully they're still tweaking the style... But who knows maybe I'll get used to it.

I like the colour changes -  for the same reasons as a certain Took... now if only the profile pictures were less conspicuous for work too ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

The forums were really hard to get to for me... Do they not have a link on the LOTRLCG mini site anymore?

I think it runs faster. Or it only is a good day for my internet connection?

Yes, 'blinding' is the word I would use.... not a fan of this.  When I saw it I thought "oh, they made it customizable," but that does not seem to be the case.  It seems brighter than MS Word, ugh..

We got a change theme button now! (next to the orange RSSbutton) and before we clawed our eyes out to!

Thank god!

Yay I'm not blinded anymore! :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

The website definitely had an override, there seems to be a lot of good changes making things smoother and more accessible so I like it! The bright white is a bit intense but can easily be changed thanks to the noted "Change Theme" at the bottom left of the page.

## 23 [Narsil0420 on February 20, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/135390-did-the-lay-out-change/?do=findComment&comment=1456633)

The new layout is formatted so much better for phones

## 24 [TwiceBorn on February 20, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/135390-did-the-lay-out-change/?do=findComment&comment=1456810)

I'm grateful for the Change Theme option, too. Definitely preferred the old colours!

Aha, indeed bluegrey/black. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

There is no bug.

Either it is a conspiracy.

Or it is an undocumented feature.

 

Well, you can change it back, so whatever. It's larger, so I'll keep the new theme.

oh my lord, first the plastic boxes and now THIS? thanks FFG for crushing my soul

Indeed!

I think it is +10 to ffg web. You can chose new or old lay-out. It is very good. Last summer, the spanish ffg web changed lay-out and all forum posts crashed, even the log-quests. And you can't chose the lay-out, and the backgournd is blinging-white!

If I remember correctly, the designer is French and works for Edge and then it is used on FFG.

## 31 [Mndela on February 20, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/135390-did-the-lay-out-change/?do=findComment&comment=1457241)

Ok, but this web is a lot of better of the edge ffg web. And when both started, both were same.

It may also be the case that the strike of the dockers on the West Coast blocks the arrival of dark pixels from China.
