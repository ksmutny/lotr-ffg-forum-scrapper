If I'm using an all leadership dwarf deck and a very good tale discards Kili (who is spirit) does this card bypass the need for a matching resource icon like vilya does?

That is a legal play.  A resource match isn't required because you aren't playing Kili from your hand.  Although this also means you wouldn't trigger Kili's ability to search for Fili.
