Any tips or ideas on how to approach this contract? Heroes? Should you go for a lot of free or almost free events to maximize its effects?

I found it helpful to:

-include heroes who can draw cards for you. If you are playing 2 or 3 events per round, your hand will get emptied even with the contract’s draw effect, and other draw effects coming out of your deck are unreliable since it’s a singleton deck.

-include many 0 and 1 cost events so you can trigger the contract’s responses often, and for profit.

-build the deck without expectation that there is any particular card that you MUST draw. Instead, include multiple cards that fill the same role. Then you can expect a particular ROLE to be filled, even if the exact card filling that role differs in each game.

How about a Galadriel/Gildor/Erestor Noldor deck? With some ways to interact with the discard pile...

Sounds fun, Erestor means you should *definitely* restrict yourself to 1- and 0-cost events, since you can't keep them around. And give preference to events you know you'll play in the round that you get them. Could view the contract as a resource generator. Only 1 copy of will of the west, so its utility will be highly dependent on when you draw it.  

When I built for this contract, I avoided traits as I don't think the council contract supports the typical established deckbuilding approaches (like: "I'm making a Noldor deck"). I thought you'd end up getting spread too thin by restricting yourself to a trait-based approach. But some people have proven me wrong, I think there's a nice Rohan-themed deck on ringsdb right now. So go for it.

I tried to put something together

Cool! High card total, but it’s an Erestor deck with other draw built in. Should make for varied games. Hope it works for you. Have you given it a spin yet?

Not yet, for now I am still testing some other Contract decks (an Arwen/Elladan/Elrohir Three Hunters, a Noldor-Dunedain anti-location The Burglar's Turn, a Gandalf hero The Grey Wanderer) but I am planning on building this one too soon.

I really like the deck this person created. Basically to recur events in hand because of secrecy. I never play with these cards so this contract really brought them to life!

My first instinct tells me: Gandalf hero but his ability doesn't work with the wording of the contract does it? "Play from your hand"?

In planning on building a deck with this contract... I realized this almost has to be done with OCTGN.

Here is a secrecy deck I derived from the tiny yet wise deck aforementioned
