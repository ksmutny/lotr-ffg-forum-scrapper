# [Shuffle the encounter deck outside of questing phase](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/253143-shuffle-the-encounter-deck-outside-of-questing-phase/)

I know that when the encounter deck is empty we have to look at the actual phase. If we are in questing phase we shuffle the discard pile him back to get a new encounter deck. Otherwise we don't. It is quit useful to give only a few shadow cards.

I always see people shuffling back the discard pile into the encounter if an encounter cards ask to reveal cards from the encounter deck (for example if we get to ambush of the shore http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Ambush-on-the-Shore-Core [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Ambush-on-the-Shore-Core] thanks to Legolas ability). But I never see a rule that ensure that. It is more a homemade rules.

So I have several questions:

1- Does I miss this rules anywhere? I look into the FAQ and don't see it. May be in the original rulebook but I don't think so.

2- If there is not such rules how are we supposed to handle those case? May be I'm wrong since the beginning of the game about that

3- If we have to set a new deck when you need to reveal a new card does we also have to if we need to "discard" cards? "Look" cards? "Shearch" cards?

4- What about players cards who do this?

Thanks.

In the absence of card instructions that contradict the rulebook, I think it is best to take the rules at face value: "An empty encounter deck only resets during the quest phase". So in your example I guess you would get lucky and not have to reveal any encounter cards after you advance to Ambush on the Shore.

Adding to jnicol's answer, page 14 of the rulebook says: "If the encounter deck is ever empty during the quest phase, the encounter discard pile is shuffled and reset back into the encounter deck.", while page 18 contains the line he quoted, which limits the resets to only the quest phase.

I believe this to be an area of poor rules compliance. i have played with three groups and seen three different sets of incorrect rules used, all thru lack of care or awareness.

Regarding reveals: most reveal's happen during the quest phase and most quest advances happen during the quest phase and frankly the deck doesn't run out very often unless you have 4 players. But, as advised above, it seems pretty clear that reveals will fail if the encounter deck is empty when they would occur.  This is big win for Legolas completing a quest, when your deck is empty or near empty. Well spotted!

It's worth noting that the deck resets when it gets empty, not when you go to draw the next card. This means you will pretty much always have at least one shadow card available.

Cards that search the encounter deck don't cause shuffles, if the deck isn't big enough (eg a card says search top 10, but there are only 3 left) then you just search the bit you have. (I believe this is from a Caleb ruling.)

While if you are asked to reveal 10 cards, but there are only 3 in the encounter deck, then whether you reset and keep revealing would depending entire on whether you are in the quest phase.
