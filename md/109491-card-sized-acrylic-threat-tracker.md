I made some of these a while back and thought some of you might be interested in seeing them. Made them on a friend's machine. Hoping to be able to purchase my own laser this summer so that I can make them available to others!

 

I've made some tokens as well.

I'd love to hear what you think!

 

(I have a Kickstarter [https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/azogames/azogames-premium-acrylic-and-wood-gaming-accessori] project going for these and other things if you'd like to check it out)

Hey nice! You're the one featured in the Tales from the Cards article [http://talesfromthecards.wordpress.com/2014/06/20/accessory-review-azogames-trackers/].

 

The trackers definitely look cool and it's nice to have variation in these things but I do prefer the original tokens (the 5 pieces and different shape are better though). It all looks nice to me, thanks for sharing!  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

If it was available outside of the US and postage wasn't too full on I would definitely buy 3x

and 3 or 4x 56cfe3d34014be9f4ab23d8eef2ead1b_large.g [https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/002/167/184/56cfe3d34014be9f4ab23d8eef2ead1b_large.gif?1403189076]

 

Both are amazingly helpful with storage and I'd love to get my hands on them.. anyway I can organise with you to do this?

Perhaps through ebay or something? So long as you are obviously going to mail them eventually I wouldn't mind a bit of a wait either, they look that good, honestly! No worries if this is too difficult or costly for you but yeah I'd really love a whole handful of those box inserts as they would help me so so much.
Well done with all of what you're working on by the way, very impressed.
