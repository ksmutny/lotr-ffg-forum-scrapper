# [Sacked! - FAQ Required? (Spoiler for CatC)](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/51029-sacked-faq-required-spoiler-for-catc/)

Here's the text on the Sacked! card:

Treachery

When revealed: Attach to a hero with no "Sacked!" cards attached controlled by the first player. (Cannot be cancelled.) Counts as a Condition attachment with the text: "Attached hero cannot attack, defend, commit to a quest, trigger its effect, or collect resources."

Shadow: If attacking ennemy is a troll, resolve this card's "when revealed" effect.

 

2 questions (basically, how would you rule it):

- If Sacked! is revealed as a shadow card, can you cancel it with Hasty Stroke? The "treachery" portion (regular when revealed effect) can't be cancelled (no Eleanor nor A Test of Will), but the "shadow" needs to resolve first before you resolve the top portion of the card ("when revealed"). I'd rule that you can use Hasty Stroke to cancel it.

- How would you resolve it if all heroes controlled by the first player already have Sacked! cards attached to them? Simply discard the just revealed card?

I think it would be discarded, yep.

I believe it is cancelled as a Shadow card effect. There is another card in the set, A Burning Brand that cancels Shadow card effects as well, I believe it may be there specificaly for this reason, too.

Throwing in another vote for "you can cancel it only as a shadow effect."

If it's revealed as a Shadow Card you do NOT resolve the "When Revealed" effect, correct? You shouldn't be resolving anything but the shadow effect portion of any card that is revealed as a shadow card, unless some other effect specifies that you should. In that case, the can't be canceled portion never even comes into play here.

The Shadow effect itself specifies it. But still the answer is the same, I strongly believe.

Aha, I should have actually read the Shadow Effect first before I responded. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

I'd say that you can cancel it as a Shadow Effect. Following the strict order of things... the "can't be canceled" is part of the When Revealed, which doesn't take effect until the Shadow Effect resolves in this case. If the Shadow Effect is canceled then the When Revealed portion never comes into play, including the uncancelable portion.

 New question for "Sacked!": Does the "(Cannot be cancelled)." refer to the whole card? When I first read it, I thought that since it came after the phrase, "Attach to a hero . . ." that the cannot-be-cancelled effect only applied to cancelling it as a treachery card. Once it becomes a condition, can it still not be cancelled?

My basic point is that I went through a lot of effort incorporating Lore cards into my deck that has no Lore heroes just so I could remove Sacked! with Miner of the Iron Hills. Now his text says nothing about cancelling Condition attachments because those don't get cancelled, they get discarded. When Revealed effects and Shadow Card effects can be cancelled. His text says to "discard" a condition attachment.

So on a technicality, I'd like to rule in my favor that Miner of the Iron Hills can remove Sacked! However, the presence of the Response effects on the Trolls saying to remove a Sacked! card makes me think that this is not what the designers had in mind.

Any insights?

no it is only the shadow card text under the bit that says shadow card.. the text boxes are mutually exclusive.. nothing above the shadow line is countered as a shadow card and nothing before the shadow line is counted as a treachery ... yes you can cancel this cards as a shadow effect

Miner can discard sacked form play... from teh card ""Counts as a condition attachment with the text".. end of story...

Yeah, as far as using Miner of the Iron Hills goes, you can't cancel the fact that you have to play the Sacked! card on a hero, but once it's in play, it's fair game and the Miner can come along and cancel it.

my votes go for

-you can cancel the shadow effect

-you can use miner or any other card that is released that does the same to discard it
