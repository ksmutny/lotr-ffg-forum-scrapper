Of course this would not be a parody of Earthra Kitt's "Santa Baby",  no one in middle earth has ever heard of such a thing.

Santa Rohan, could use a second quester with me,

you see

I'm so lonely out here

Santa Rohan, so hurry up and get in the fight.

 

Santa Rohan, a big strong man with Sentinel too,

-in blue

Help your niece out this year

Santa Rohan, so hurry up and get in the fight.

Think of all the quests that

I haven't lost

Think of all the allies you'll re-

-duce in cost

Santa Rohan, so hurry up and get in the fight.

Santa Rohan, there's one other thing that I lack,

attack

bring Herugrim with you

Santa Rohan, so hurry up and get in the fight.

Santa Rohan, my deck could use a way to draw cards,

a bard,

or a minstrel will do

Santa Rohan, so hurry up and get in the fight.

Think of all the quests that
I haven't lost

Think of all the allies you'll re-

-duce in cost.

Santa Rohan, so hurry up and get in the fight.

Santa Rohan, there's one more thing I really do need,

a steed

Snowmane's perfect for me

Santa Rohan, so hurry up and get in the fight.

Hurry up and get in the fight

So hurry up and get in the fight.

Thank you for creating a new Yuletide classic. I shall sing this as I stare ceaselessly at my fireplace, waiting for Santa Rohan to arrive with all my goodies.

And his starting threat of 12 is thus December too.

Never used the card but when I do I just KNOW this will be going around in my head :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Edit: PS thats how Grima managed to poison him, it wasnt Sarumans words at all it was just a drop of nasty-ooze in all those Sherrys left out by children!
