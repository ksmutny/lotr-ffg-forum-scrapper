Hello all,

 

 

I am starting the adventure with LOTR LCG and since some of you already had the pleasure of roaming Middle Earth in this great game i would like to ask you for a confirmation on one question that popped up while going through the rules :-)

After the questing phase one gets the threat up by the difference between total willpower of heroes commited to quest and encounter cards sitting in staging area - now maybe this is a silly question but since it is not explicitly put in the rules can anyone confirm what happens if the is nobody questing in given phase?

Now if i go by pure logic only it would seem you would have to add all threat from staging area without any deductions but since it is so cruel i want to double confirm :-) Can anyone pls advise if my understanding is correct?

 

Many thanks in advance!

I'm afraid that's correct, yes.

Hi

you got that right: if nobody is commited to a quest you get all the threat in the staging area. This game mechanic assures that the players are allways questin' ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

Something I've inferred from the rules, but thought it worth checking:

When a monster engages a player they leave the staging area. This implies to me they no longer add their threat to the Questing Phase, a fact which would have made my first run through a little easier!

Anyone agree/disagree with that interpretation?

Yep, agree. Engaging enemies is a good way to reduce the threat.
