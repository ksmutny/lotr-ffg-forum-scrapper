I was playing through a Knife in the Dark yesterday and was trying to take care of Bill Ferny with Hail of Stones and exhausting 5 characters. I drew this card with my Tactics/Lore deck, and had exactly 5 characters to exhaust, so it all went well and good. But the question occurred to me: can you exhaust cards from two separate players to pay for "exhaust X amount of characters" requirements? Like for Peace and Thought, Hail of Stones and cards like that? Thanks!

As it doesn't specifically say that you're limited to your own characters, it should be possible (might piss off your partner though).

It's considered a "cost" when the card is written as "Do X to do Y."  X is the cost.  You have to use your own resources (meaning resource tokens, cards in your hand, characters under your control) to pay costs.

Ah, you're correct. It's even in the rulebook (p. 25)! (not that it makes any sense thematically)

Thanks! I thought I had remembered reading it was like the resources, but wasn't sure.

If that had been the case I would have found that quite hilarious ...at least the first time and quite annoying after that!!
