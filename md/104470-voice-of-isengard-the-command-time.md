Hi everibody

How does this command works?

I mean, When i remove all the counters, have I to place again counters on my quest???

If it's so, I think that this expansion is very difficult to solve....

Don't you Think so?

Hi there!

 

It says on the encounter cards that you have to reset the timer on a certain number. Or it tells you, like stage 1B from Ford of the Isen, that it's game over.

 

Example: Ford of the Isen  stage 2B tells you to add damage to your caharcters equal to the number of cards in your hands and to place two new timer tokens on the quest card.

Omg...that's gonna be difficult to complete.

Hint for the first scenario: try Eowyn and use her ability every turn!

 

Good luck! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

The second scenario, stage 2b says Forced: After the last time counter is removed for this stage, shuffle the discard pile into the encounter deck and reveal 2 encounter cards per player. Place 2 time counters on this stage.

Omighosh.....!

How is possibile to' solve it?

Every two turns 2 new encounter cards ??

Well, you get an extra time counter each time your party would place progress on the quest card during the quest phase. So, if you always do that, it's not that hard (if it weren't for some nasty encounter card effects). In my solo games I had success by using decks with a low startig threat (for example, Hobbits).

Here is the point!

The italian translation is wrong!

It si written to' place a progress token, not a time counter....!!

Ok, guys thanks for everything...

Let's try a new adventure...!
