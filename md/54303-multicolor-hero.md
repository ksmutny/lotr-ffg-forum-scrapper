Just to be sure. A card that gives a hero another 'icon' such as mind, tactics, leadership or so, does that hero generate 2 tokens (1 of each type - his own and the attachment's) or do his powertokens merely count for both colors?

He still only generates 1 token per turn. His resources can be used to pay for cards from either sphere, however.

Thanks! Glad we're playing it good now.

Also, it should be noted that this allows him to count for either sphere in the case of a card that specifically targets a character of a specific sphere as well. You can use this in combination with certain attachments and it works out well. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 Another think I think we will see in the future is a hero that comes stock with at least 2 spheres of influence. They could dull down the stats to make up for this advantage. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 I think what we're definitely going to see is a hero, who will be weak in stats, but will have the ability, much like Bilbo, to produce TWO resource tokens per round... the game's just crying for such a hero... :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

You already have that in Theodred.

Theodred however, can only do it with the condition that he must go questing. Here, we are looking at a hero that would generate two resources without conditions. That would be a monstrously powerful ability, as the game already has a number of ways to add card draw, and nothing beats having a bunch of cards in your hand and having the resources to play them. In the early stages of this game, it seems that the designers have limited the ways in which you can add extra resources, though. Let's see what happens as, no doubt, more resource oriented cards will eventually be released.
