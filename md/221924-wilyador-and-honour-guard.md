Some may know my questions from just listing the two card titles... but I couldn't find an answer so I wanna ask here.

 

In A Journey to Rhosgobel can you use Honour Guard to prevent damaged Wilyador suffers each turn?  Does this remove Honour Guard from play?

This question was already asked. Yes, Honour Guard can cancel damage to Wilyador even if Rhosgobel is in play, and he doesn't get removed from the game because he "cancelled damage" instead of "healing" Wilyador. With two in play, you cancel all damage from its forced effect and with more you cancel damage from the treacheries.

Thank you.  I was sure the question was already asked, but I couldn't find the answer.

Yeah, Honour Guards + Distant Stars really break this quest, even in NM.

Ah, I didn't think about Distant Stars - you can grab forest grove and repeat it to rob the Athelas, and then speed the questing.

 

idk if I consider these things "broken" since I'm doing this pure solo.  Getting through the encounter deck to find objectives takes a lot of time...

"rob the Athelas"

I love it!
