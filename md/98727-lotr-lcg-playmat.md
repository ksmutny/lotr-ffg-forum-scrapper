Hey everybody.

 

I found that video and this fantasytic playmat :o [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_ohmy.png]  But it seems that they were not for sale.

Does anybody know if there is a possibility to get such beatifull mats?

Or will there be some in the future?

 

Would be great if there would be those matts as play material. Would pay the world for it :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

The play mats come with the game night kits that FFG sends directly to game stores and, as far as I know, they're not available for the general public to purchase.  They do pop up on eBay from time to time.  I searched real quick and there's a couple of the Season Three game night kit play mats on there now:  http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_trksid=p2050601.m570.l1313.TR0.TRC0.Xlord+of+the+rings+play+mat&_nkw=lord+of+the+rings+play+mat&_sacat=0&_from=R40 [http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_trksid=p2050601.m570.l1313.TR0.TRC0.Xlord+of+the+rings+play+mat&_nkw=lord+of+the+rings+play+mat&_sacat=0&_from=R40]
