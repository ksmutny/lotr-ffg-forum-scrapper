I've just published my second quest, this time using the encounter cards from Rhosgobel. If you don't have this adventure pack, no problem, there is a version that uses the core set only.

If you fancy respite from the depths of Khazad Dum, then this is the quest for you.

"Four Seasons" uses 5 new cards, none of which are shuffled into the encounter deck, so its as easy as "print and play". If you do like to create nice new cards using photo papaer, I have provided a second jpg file with the backs of the cards, ideal for double sided printing.

Like Rhosgobel, I have rated the difficulty level of this quest as 6.

If you've already played my first quest, the Temple of Melkor, why not try the updated version, recently improved following user feedback.
