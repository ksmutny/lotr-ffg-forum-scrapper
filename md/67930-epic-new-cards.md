elrond, vilya …wow

Great cards (overpowered blah blah), but I can't really imagine Elrond going round himself doing all these different quests, I would have thought he'd have been a Gandalf-style Ally.

Who's going to make Dad and the Boys deck? Starting threat what, 33?

The way they talk about the ring of power in the article though, makes it sound like there won't be another card specifically for the ring. because they talk about "elrond and his ring of power", as if they come combined. i dont think we are going to get a ring attachment.

if that's the case, how are we going to kill the balrog? maybe we won't have to.

Ridiculously powerful cards.

Well, with the emotion for the new cards I totally overlooked this thread, and started a new one. Sorry about that.

Anyway, really awesome cards. And of course the art for Elrond is by our beloved Magali Villeneuve.  And about Vilya, I have thought that we would get it, instead of Narya as sometimes we have commented in the forum.

And Elrond seems very powerful, but he is now the higher threat cost hero in the game, IIRC, isn't he?

 

 PD: Just realized that his stats sum up only 12, and he has 13 for threat cost.

Elrond, Glordindel + Light of Valinor = great secrecy deck!

 

Love these cards, although Beravor must be grinding her teeth with all these new card drawing abilities we get lately.

 Dear god………..just turned on my computer and then THIS!!!!

Man, these cards are crazy good. Elrond himself opens up a few really awesome new deck types. Can't wait for this pack now.

Lol at another ridiculously powerful blue/green card though. Still not much love for red/purple. Someday maybe, lol…

psshaw.  The cards are solid, but they are no where near as powerful as what we got last box.  I would say that these cards are fascinating without being hugely unbalancing.

thematically they are some of the best we have so far…..they just keep getting better and better, i feel this game has really got into its full swing now- well done ffg!

 Does anybody else see a young Hugo Weaving in Elrond?

nah…not really, im pleased they went for a more youthful looking elrond…..mind you we knew what to expect from the needful to know card as this was said on magali's site to be him as well

Good point.  Maybe that's why he looks familiar.

Extraordinary cards. Bravo FFG! I really look forward to putting these into a deck.

For those of us with some Bilbo in our blood… this game's fun factor just continues to rise.

I mean, the possibilities for creating multiple fascinating "what if" story lines and adventures is getting pretty grand.

And I also can't help but imagine that things can continue along this trajectory for quite some time.

I'm enjoying this opportunity to savor the past, delight in the present, and anticipate the future - all at once!

Just lovely!

exactly juicebox- imagine in a few years when we get to mordor, we can do an entire frodo's journey nightmare run!

I would just want to say here now, congrats Rich for guessing the minstrel in Elrond just right, not only the final design is close to your idea but the art of the Ring also suggests the musical hints in the Elven lord.

For those who wanted Dain's sort of ability, I guess we have to wait for Thranduil to give an overall boost to Silvan (which will have to get some love soon, I feel), or maybe Galadriel or Celeborn. It may be though Dwarves will be specific in these "global" boost synergies? I think Silvan would fit that as well; maybe Noldor strategies will be more based around the powerful individuals, like Elrond or Glorfindel.

thank you. and i think you could be right on thranduil, being more of dain stature (at least amongst silvan) and in the hobbit he is after all called king

I just have to point out that in the rule book, we "defeat" enemies.  This is different than killing and I for one keep to the idea of defeating something as to not technically contradict the cannon.  Defeating can range from tactical retreat of the heroes to tactical retreat of the enemies.  If you think only in terms of killing the monsters then there will be places in your mind's eye that contradict the cannon events.

Really good insight, actually.  Lore-wise and thematically, it fits much better, as the Noldor tended to be quite fractured amongst themselves (and others) at times….   Aand by "at times", I mean for pretty much all of Tolkien's written history ;-) 

Tolkien himself wrote that "they (the Noldor) needed room to quarrel in" (in The War of the Jewels).  When reading about events like the Kin-slaying, the betrayal and crossing of the Grinding Ice, and  the attacks on Beren, Luthien, and Doriath, it's hard to see them as a unified bunch of folks.  The sons of Feanor (who caused most of the grief), for all apparent purposes ignored the succession of the Noldorian High-King.  For all the discord, the Noldor/Feanorians were also prone to the greatest acts and skilled beyond nearly all others (including the Valar).  So your concept of the Noldorian strategies being more individually-based is spot-on IMHO.  I definitely could see the Silvan getting a sort of "universal bump" from Thranduil, but as they were very distrustful of the dwarves, and to some extent Noldorians, it would be kinda interesting to see some sort of "penalty" or limitation if they were in play together.
