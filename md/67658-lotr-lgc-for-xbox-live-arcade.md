I'm sure this isn't even in the works as I don't know really anyone that actually plays the card game version but I was wondering if anyone knows if there is anything in the works for an official virtual version of the game like they did for MTG.

It's a long shot I know but I have to ask just for peace of mind.

It would be awesome if I could type the topic title correctly. Of course I meant LCG.

 

My bad.

There is not and I greatly doubt they ever do something like this. No, I even confident that they will never do something like this.

If they released a version of their LCGs for Steam, PS3 and XBLA that was something like the Magic the Gathering Duels of the Planeswalkers it would do nothing for FFG apart form make them tons of money.. they are complete idiots for not doing this… it should be a high priority.

 I think in case of LOTR:LCG license is holding FFG back (they are only allowed to produce the card game). I am sure that some other big-shot company in the video game industry holds the license for digital game (and it is unlikely that FFG will get hold of it in a near future)

I agree 100%. The makers of the Shadow Era [http://www.shadowera.com/] card game are making money hand over fist through micro transactions (a dollar here, 5 there), despite having a totally underwhelming game. Even though it is far below the Game of Thrones LCG, or even MTG, I have still dropped $40 on it because I like being able to play games on my phone, whenever I want, against other people.

Nettrunner really should have been done all online.
