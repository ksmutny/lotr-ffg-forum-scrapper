# [No. of quest cards in conflict at the carrock](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/51780-no-of-quest-cards-in-conflict-at-the-carrock/)

Probably a silly question but is there only meant to be 2 quest cards in this set?

 

The first set had 3 quest cards and the 3rd one specifically says the players have won if they complete it, all the 2nd quest card says is players cant defeat the stage if there are trolls in play?

 

Can't imagine what the 3rd stage would be but the wording seems odd, as if there is meant to be another step.

Yo, I ran into the same problem. I only have 2 quest cards. I sent an email to customer support to see if they will send me the 3rd quest card, but I haven't heard anything back yet. It seems like there should be another one, but I don't know. Hopefully I will hear something back soon. happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]

 Carrock has only 2 quest cards.  The "players have won the game" text is missing from the card, which is rather unfortunate.

FFG really needs to make an announcement about this and put it front and center on the LOTR:LCG page. In addition (or at the very least) they need to sticky one of these threads so that we don't see a new one popping up every second day. This is clearly an issue for a lot of players and it needs to be dealt with.

After having time to read over the quest cards and playing the expansion: Conflict at the carrock, there are only 2 quest cards and the carrock is in a sense the 3 quest location. I really enjoyed this expansion. Nothing like 4 trolls waiting on you at the top of a rock!!! sorpresa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sorpresa.gif]
