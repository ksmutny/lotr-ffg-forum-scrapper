 I ask this wondering if there might be some players interested in playing in a tournament but might have some concerns because they are new to the game or not as competitive as others.  In addition, there are others who want more of a challenge and think certain cards should be limited or restricted.  So, thoughts?

Regular: in a tournament this would mean all Heros and all current cards are usable.

Pro: certain Heros and cards might be off limits, or restricted in some way.

Extreme: limited hero pool and only 1 copy of each card in your deck.  (meaning a 50 card deck would have 50 different cards.)

 I would only be interested in playing regular games. I don't want to pay for cards and then not be allowed to use them.

im not a tourn. player (dont worry im not here to troll lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif]) but i wanted to post about in your other thread where *cant remember who now* said that not enough players compete to justify different levels of difficulty

i think its worth pointing out that this will change if tournaments gets its own catagory- which hopefully should happen with our support- i reckon that even new players if they see a tournaments page will start to compete- so yeah, i reckon if large competative scene is what you want- that may start to happen after it gets its own place :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]
