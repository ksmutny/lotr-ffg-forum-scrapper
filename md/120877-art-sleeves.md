I'd really like to see some more art sleeves for this game. The four existing ones (not counting the generic ring and eye backs) are great but there's been so much fantastic art for this game since the core set, and since this game seems more popular then ever at the moment it seems a great chance to showcase some. Is anybody else interested, if so which pieces of art would you like to see?

My top picks would be Arwen (player card), Lore Aragorn and Hands upon the Bow.

Completely agree. In fact, I almost made this thread last week. The core set art has become old and there has been so much great artwork since.

Location art would be great! I also love Leadership Boromir and Galadriel.

Definitely. I made a thread like this a couple of months ago. With all the wonderful art in this game, it's a bit strange that there aren't more art sleeves. My Gondor-playing friend uses the Daughter of the Nimrodel ones but has requested some with Boromir, Beregond or some other Gondor hero or location. I usually play elves and rangers, and I don't really feel like using Gimli sleeves.

Do you guys sleeve all the player cards in the same art sleeves? If you change now for a new design don't you have to re-sleeve all your collection?

I'm just looking to sleeve my active decks. I keep the other player cards in binders and the encounter cards in clear sleeves.
