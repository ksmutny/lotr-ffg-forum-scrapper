# [Bad Card Designs (Part 1)](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93680-bad-card-designs-part-1/)

## 1 [lleimmoen on November 18, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93680-bad-card-designs-part-1/?do=findComment&comment=911151)

In this series, I will concentrate on certain card design (not art) which I find unfortunate.

 

I will start with two Spirit cards from the core set, Dwarven Tomb and Unexpected Courage. They come to mind quickly when I see two newer cards from the Against the Shadow cycle, Map of Eärnil and Steed of the Mark. And these new cards are what I call "well-designed" but their only problem lies in the cards above which make them bad tactical choices.

 

If you compare Dwarven Tomb to Map of Eärnil, the former is just better. This I could accept in an inter-spheral comparison but not within the sphere. Dwarven Tomb costs what Map of Eärnil does at its best (not taking into considerations wild coop combos like Desperate Alliance). Tomb is also an event which makes it easier to play. And it can recover any Spirit card, not just events. Finally, it can successfully recover response events whilst the Map can only recycle action events.

 

Players with long experience tend to fear power creep. This above is an example of the opposite when there is a new card that is way, way inferior to an old one. Does inferior means better design? I would say so in this case, because the Map is perfectly playable, recycling cards like Elrond's Counsel, The Galadhrim's Greeting or Stand and Fight can be very useful, so there seems little arguing that the Map is not strong enough. And that in itself is a good argument for the Tomb being too strong a card. And the fact it only appears once in the core set is no salvation.

 

The other comparison, Unexpected Courage and Steed of the Mark. This one may be even more extreme. Steed is cheaper by 1 but to use it, you already lose the resource advantage the first time you use it. Then, the use is way more limited, with the Courage a hero can do any two actions, be it quest, combat or ability. With the Steed he can only quest and do one more thing (afterwards). This is already a huge difference but it goes far further. For some reason the much more able card, the Courage, has no restrictions, and can be played on any hero, whilst the Steed can only be attached to Gondor or Rohan heroes.

 

Now, is the Steed good enough? Well it is not an obvious winner but I feel it can be super useful. As they say in the preview, for one resource you make any Gondor or Rohan hero a Core Aragorn, not bad. Plus, soon we might see some Mount synergies coming from the partly Rohan cycle. So where's the problem, you see it, the Courage.

 

Solution? As much as I hate to say this, it is errata. Far less potent cards have got it already, so here's time now for these two. Hope others are with me, and ffg are reading...

 

Wait, to say errata is not enough, right? We need to know how to shaft them. It is not easy but for the Courage, I give two solutions. The first is in accord to what core set card distribution does. Why not print "Limit 1 per deck" on Unexpected Courage. I wouldn't say unique because it doesn't make much sense, thematically, and the designers have been very good with those, maybe save Light of Valinor which also makes little sense being unique (but it helps keep the balance of the power of the card). The other solution could be the cost though I wonder if errata ever goes that way, having a text missing or added is one thing but having something else printed is a bigger problem - unless we finally get the reprint of the cards changed by designers after we had bought them.

 

As for Dwarven Tomb, I think it is even harder here. I wouldn't want this to become another Dwarven synergy card as we have gotten quite too many of those already. Limitation on the cards it pulls could also be a trouble: if it only works for allies, it would be probably inferior to Stand and Fight. However, it could only work for attachments, after all the thematic ground of this card could be the Book of Mazarbul. So yeah, this is where I would go: dig the grave for a Spirit attachment.

 

Please, share your thoughts if you feel like...

I agree that some of newer player cards are inferior compared to the old ones.

 

I think the problem is that right after Dwarrowdelf Cycle, developers got really concerned with power creep and decided to ton everything down, which resulted in this situation.

 

We've seen some crazy powerful during Dwarrowdelf Cycle.

I'm still unsure what was the process between development of Zigil Miner and Stargazer and their (well Zigil Miner's) errata.

It wasn't even an unforseeable card interaction; they were working as intended... it's just that their intended use broke the game's resource system 5 minutes after they were released.

 

Even though there were no Dwarf heroes or very little Dwarf allies during Dwarrowdelf Cycle, most Dwarf power houses relies on cards from that Cycle.

We are not Idle and Lure of Moria in same Cycle? Not to mention Legacy of Durin which has potential to (and very often) draws half a dozen cards in single phase.

 

Not to mention Spirit Glorfindel, who was clearly meant to be used with Light of Valinor and became single powerful hero by far.... to abuse Elrond and Vilya you atleast had to eat high threat cost of 13, price you 'paid' for abusing Spirifindel and Light is 1 threat per Glorfindel questing if you couldn't manage to find Light of Valinor after Glorfindel quested 7 times.

 

Then we have Against the Shadow Cycle, where almost every card is designed to be outshined by old cards (with exception of Outlands)

Even the iconic hero like Boromir had his ability split into the card itself and an attachment that came out 6 adventure packs after.

 

It's almost like designers are so afraid of power-creep we are having power-crawling-backwards.

 

 

As you suggest in this thread, series of simple yet effective errata on bunch of old cards may be solution (example I could think of would be make Gondor trait requirement for Steard of Gondor, not added effect), but as a forgetful guy I wish FFG would take another, more difficult path to solve this solution; controlled power creep, boosting power level of 'weak' cards to be roughly same as 'powerful' cards... but that process will probably take another Cycle or two and one slip-up and we would be in worse situation than we are currently in.

I find your last paragraph excellent. I wanted to address Steward of Gondor in the next series, and I would have the same solution. There should have been a requirement for the Steward, not a bonus to an already superb effect.

 

Also, making weaker cards effective is certainly a great feat, but one that is extremely difficult to achieve. Still, since the errata already does, and is bound to, exist, it can do with a couple fit entries.

## 4 [richsabre on November 18, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93680-bad-card-designs-part-1/?do=findComment&comment=911211)

yes, i agree. the core set certainly had some winners which i doubt we shall see the likes of by the time the game ends. steward was what i was writing when you posted the subject yourself

 

it is an interesting case to have power 'shrink' in a game. i have usually found that recent packs have power cards that only really gain their power from core set or similar time packs.

 

as to the question of which should happen - strong cards lose power or weak cards gain power...that is an interesting question. as you say, it is more difficult, and perhaps more destructive to the game, to make weak cards more powerful, rather than powerful cards weaker. i do feel many gamers will be angry at the prospect of having many of their favourite power combos destroyed so ffg would have to be very careful with the errate :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Errata is a 4-letter word. If you think something is too powerful, don't use it. Or house rule it. I could understand if we were talking about a game with a sanctioned tournament format, but asking the designers to solve your personal problems with certain cards - especially in a casual game like this one - really isn't fair to the hundreds of other players.

 

That said, I'm sure the designers didn't expect that many people would own more than 1-2 core sets, so that is how they balanced the cards you say are too powerful. Personally, I think they are fine. The fact that the designers made inherently weaker versions of other cards doesn't mean they should retroactively do something to force people to try to use them.

## 7 [Glaurung on November 18, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93680-bad-card-designs-part-1/?do=findComment&comment=911236)

That was already discuss already….

 

Also thinking about Lore Aragorn with a new doom cards from VOI he will be crazy powerful…….

 

So for me UC should be unique or Limit once per hero. Also Cards like Will of the west we are not idle or legacy of Durin long time crying for errata. 

 

I try play Legacy of Durin like: exhaust LOD to draw card when you play a dwarf. And is still pretty powerful even that way.

 

Without errata or kind of ban or restricted list game will look very odd after VOI will be release. Will see what happen? Or maybe new Encounter cards will be so powerful?  Im doubt about that….

First we have a tournaments system already , second one we have quest log a well. And last balance in the game should be. It is not  kind of weird if game mechanic have some crazy holes like this ? Sounds not serious for me……The game should be healthy no? 

 

We must to have some kind of main stream of the game with fair rules to play with other players or not?

Boris, your arguments are simply breath-taking. "I think they're fine." Point taken, end of discussion, well done!

 

Yet, your advanced vocabulary doesn't remind me of elementary school, so I am a bit lost there. Have you been around much? Errata is not fair? Maybe, but if you followed this game, you'd know it happens quite regularly, whether you find it fair or not.

 

What I find not fair is creating two cards that do the same thing, one being clearly better than the other. That is paying twice for one card basically. And that needs be fixed, in my opinion.

## 10 [leptokurt on November 18, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93680-bad-card-designs-part-1/?do=findComment&comment=911247)

Unexpected Courage and Dwarven Tomb are bad examples for me. I only have one copy of these, so I am very happy to get additonal opportunites to ready my heroes. That's why IMO you don't have to limit UC, but you just only use one copy. I could not imagine to play with three copies of such a powerful card.

 

In both cases I'd say that it doesn't really matter if they're better than their predecessors, as you might just want to have them in your deck to increase the chance to draw a card of that kind.

 

One thing they could have done is to use the secrecy keyword again. Make the Steed secrecy 1, and it's an excellent choice for most spirit decks. Or something like "SotM" cannot be removed from the attached character.

 

 

Eventually, Ellareth has been making an excellent point about power creep.

## 11 [lleimmoen on November 18, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93680-bad-card-designs-part-1/?do=findComment&comment=911270)

Thanks Richard, I too find it interesting what core set holds: some of the strongest and weakest cards in the game so far. Lack of foresight maybe? Surely understandable as it is hard to predict what shall come... and the change of the main designers might have played a role, too.

 

Thanks Glaurung, for once I completely agree with you. The game should be healthy. I don't buy the stuff like "if you don't like it, don't play it." I pay it, and I want to play it by the rules, and I want the rules to make sense.

 

Thanks Leptokurt, you might see you contradict yourself there, first saying UC needs no errata, then that you could not imagine playing with three copies of it. But this is the case exactly. In a tournament settings - and this is really no hypothesis - it is too late to be saying to your "opponents" that they should be of good sport and use a single copy of UC. Even if each of them only has a single copy of the core set, they would have two copies of it for coop. In the end, you basically agree with what I wrote: "Limit 1 per deck." They really could have gone that way from the start: making the cards than only came once in the core set limited as such.

This.

 

We in our group use house rules. And only restrictive ones.

For expamle on this subject: we have access to 3 core sets, so we can use every "power card" multiple times.

One of our house rule states that every card that gets the stamp "power card" is limited to 1 per deck.

In our case that includes obvious cards like Gandalf, UC & SoG which are discussed here.

 

You can make your own rules as this is not PvP.

Errata = the last resort to close loopholes that really break the game.

And even then you can choose to ignore errata's and play however you like.

Nobody cares anyhow how you play, as you play at your own table in your own house and can cheat all you like.

 

 

Bottom line: if you don't like it; restrict yourself, don't restirct everybody.

But this is not the point. Really, do not pretend like the errata is not there, it is. And it will most likely grow in number whether you like it or not. Now, I could tell you the same thing, if you don't like the errata, just don't use it, don't play by the rules if you don't feel like, don't play the game if it's too bad.

 

But then again, you basically said that later, just as you said you use the same trick I had suggested.

I'm happy letting people solve their own problems here.  Noccus presents a solution that is entirely workable.  The only problem is that it's a solution which is not printed in black and white, so you might not like that solution if you feel unsatisfied when playing with rules that are not officially sanctioned.

## 15 [Zalrus9 on November 18, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93680-bad-card-designs-part-1/?do=findComment&comment=911370)

Playing Devil's advocate here, but the reason we've had the erratas before were due to things that actually broke the game. Not made things less fun, but made for combos that sort of made for things not fun. 5 or so resources per turn in spirit? Infinite combos? Those are actively bad for the game. It may be that some of the older cards are a bit too powerful (and I know that spirit Glorfindel is pretty OP), but they do not break the game. See Tales From the Cards article about breaking the game in relation to Dain: http://talesfromthecards.wordpress.com/2013/04/09/is-dain-broken/ [http://talesfromthecards.wordpress.com/2013/04/09/is-dain-broken/].

 

That said, I think with The Voice of Isenguard, we might well see some power creep, at a price. None of us really know what the future holds, but I'm optimistic! But hey, if there's errata, there's errata. I trust the designers to fix their game.

GrandSpleen, yes, thank you, this is what I meant, some people just like to play according to the rules, not making them up. I have tried house rules in many a game, it never felt satisfying.

 

Zalrus9, thanks for participation. I guess my point is not about cards being broken, what concerns me is "dead" cards or "obvious" cards. I hate having two cards of the same sphere knowing that choosing one of them is ALWAYS beneficial in terms of the game mechanics. The above examples may not be spot-on, but they are pretty close. As for Dain, he shall be the next subject, I consider him bad design also because there is no other candidate to choose instead of him when making a Dwarf deck, there is no one to challenge his position.

In this thread I mostly see two types of people.

Those who want to follow or exploit the rules to death (like enforcing tabletalk rule like jerk or not applying any kind of self-controlled restriction) and still have enjoyable game,

and those who doesn't mind house-ruling or self-restricting a bit (like playing double-handed or ignoring/self-errata-ing certain cards) to tailor the game to be enjoyable.

 

former clearly wants things to change, but only wants developers to change them,

latter clearly doesn't see need for things to change officially since coop game can be changed unofficially.

 

If developers does not change the game because we can house-rule to change the game to each of our satisfaction,

former group would be happy (since they already are happy) but latter would be unsatisfied.

 

If developers does change the game because people want the game as whole (the game, the whole game, nothing but the game),

latter group would be happy (since they got change they wanted) and former group could continue to apply new house-rules or ignore new errata and be satisfied..... sounds like a win-win (or win-neutral... but defeinitely not win-lose)

 

So I'm really confused as to everytime group of people express their want for something to change (with reasonable reasons) why another group of people wants to (or feel the need to) tell them off.

 

 

As for errata being reserved only for cards that somehow obseletes a game's mechanism,

I agree that is how the things should be, but would also argue that that is not the case with this game.

Maybe it was true for first set of errata, but the cards that have received errata later didn't actually break the game or if they had potential to break the game they still do but is just little bit more difficult (Feint and Master of Lore being exception... although I don't believe Master of Lore errata was a good call.)

 

What is interesting is that we actually have a sort of backwards-errata with Ravens of I-forgot-what-it-is-called Hill.

I refuse to believe developers were careless enough to let one of the few defined word (reveal) slip through their fingers.

I believe that developers saw the danger of letting people make progress tokens on active quest using Event card Action so made that card high risk danger (revealing instead of just looking), but then people complained enough that they changed it.

Funny thing is even if the Ravens still had the wording reveal instead of looking, it wouldn't really hurt that French-deck-that-can-win-the-game-in-first-round much at all.

 

I agree that errata should be issued with care, but disagree that it should only be issued when core mechanisms are in danger... it can be (and there are cases) where errata was used to bring the cards down a notch (or bring the card up a notch)

I agree. More concerned about what the new rules or erratas might look like than the current unbalances (I just play this game for fun).

 

What if the there was a collaborative forum based created set of additional rules/erratas? Would this be helpful, for people wanting changes? That it wasn't just your own house rules - Then people could choose to play easy mode, normal mode or forum mode?

Same here, I am confused. It really seems some people willingly disobey the rules, and then they are afraid for them to change because it would spoil it for them. Talking of paradox.

You know, this is basically what I was trying to find out. I wanted to see if people agree about certain arguments. And then, had it succeeded, perhaps even hope ffg would go and think and maybe change things up a bit.

 

I don't think I will be too self-confident if I say that we here are among the best play-testers ffg can get. And the designers know themselves they make mistakes. So I think it is not bitching but rather nice to tell them collectively (and for free).

 

However, I see there is not a real consensus. Or there might be about the cards, more or less, but there is none about the corresponding action (or the results of the inequality).

And finally, as for ffg errata: No, it has little to nothing to do with breaking the game. Master of Lore is a perfect example of a card with very limited potential, not allowing any loops (it had always been the other cards), yet it got shafted and is now rubbish. Such errata I dislike but still obey.

## 24 [Distractionbeast on November 18, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93680-bad-card-designs-part-1/?do=findComment&comment=911486)

I follow all the errata as well.  I also don't proxy cards.  I like the purity of having the cards in hand and playing them "as intended" by the designers, but I am sometimes puzzled. 

 

And as for Power in the Earth - they should errata that one to make it useful.  My suggestions:

 * Make it 0 cost, OR
 * Make it reduce the threat by 2, OR
 * add: "If the threat of the attached location is ever 0, discard it."  OR
 * add: "draw 1 card."

Yes I wish that they would either un-errata this one... or at least reduce the cost to 2!

 

because of where I live in the world, plus deliveries going astray, it can be six months be months before I get a pack. - still waiting for Black riders, 3x orders failed to arrive. Currently on order from two separate places, will give away second copy - if it actually arrives)...

 

So by the time I get them they can already be errata-ed an,d in Master of Lore's case, semi useless before I get to play

It's not entirely about not obeying the rules. I'm following the rules strictly, but I don't use cards that I consider as overpowered. Also, it's about the direction that we're going if we start to use errata on cards that are not overpowered, but strong. Where does it end?


 

Same here, I am confused. It really seems some people willingly disobey the rules, and then they are afraid for them to change because it would spoil it for them. Talking of paradox.

 

So I'm really confused as to everytime group of people express their want for something to change (with reasonable reasons) why another group of people wants to (or feel the need to) tell them off.

 

 

Arwen, Elrond's Counsel, Sneak Attack, Faramir (ally), Feint, Steward of Gondor etc

 

Evebtually there are still new players out there who have only a limited pool of cards. Not sure if they were happy about restricted versions of these cards.

I have been around for quite a while and I understand why errata occurs - not just in this game, but in general. The errata that has occurred in this game has been based on issues where combos were broken. Beravor was not intended to be allowed to draw out half the deck in a single round for a big Protector quest play, nor was the zigil dwarf guy intended to rack up a ton of resources for a huge 1-turn trick win option. Errata was necessary on those cards due to the fact that the designers were unable to account for every possible manipulation.

 

What you are asking for is far different. You want older, better cards to be neutered to accomodate weaker design options. As someone who owns three core sets, I don't, and I resent the implication that it's necessary to punish people who want to use 3 copies just because Caleb made a weaker concept in an encounter pack.

If you plan on playing in tournaments things like card balance, the FAQ, and errata should concern you.  You should want them to keep cards too far from average out of the environment.  If you are going to a tournament, and you absolutely have to have 3 of a card in your deck no matter what sphere you are playing it probably needs a nerf.  If you are going to a tournament and there is a hero that every single team shows up with that hero probably needs a nerf.  If you go to a tournament and every team/individual is playing the same archetype it probably needs a nerf.

 

If you are playing at home your attitude should be more along these lines...

Hmm, one of the reasons, if not the reason for Beravor being able to draw so many cards, was Unexpected Courage. Now there are a few more options but most of them were not around when the errata happened.

 

Then for Zigil, I am not sure what the intention was when they made the card but people were mentioning him as broken the day he came out. I could even link my own thread - the weak it got previewed for the Khazad-dum announcement. This total lack of foresight on ffg part is quite beyond me, but it is a subject for different thread - or many in the past.

 

And no, if you read the above, errata didn't just happen for the so-called "broken" combos.

 

But finally, what you imply is not true. I do not want to punish anyone, I want to reward those who buy the game. I want them to have both Dwarven Tomb and Map of Eärnil as viable options, same as the Courage and the Steed; not just one of the two (and the other in case you don't find anything better for your decks than the fillers). It is the main reason, and I will not say it again, I feel every card should have its place, or at least a chance for it. I don't even mind Power of the Earth even though it is probably super weak - but there is no similar card that does the thing better - within the sphere.

I like your point about new or perhaps even struggling players... I generally play the erratas whether I like them or not... though took a while to accept the changes to Thror's map.

 

It was only when i had played the game enough and felt semi competent that I felt happy to play the errata'ed version of Thror's map.. which simply means, it came out of my deck(s) and joined master of Lore, power in the earth, keeping count, The favour of the lady, brok Ironfist etc... 

 

I think any wholesales changes for balance, organised play etc (and I think there are some perfectly valid reasons for considering these) should look more like "Advanced" mode... as, especially for new players & people with limited card options this game is really challenging....

There is a tournament system but this is not a supported organized play game. At least, it wasn't listed in the OP article of games stores can host events for. I have a way to make the game competitive but it has never been tried.

> Thanks Kassad, nicely put.

 

I've played quite a few card games competitively and a few card games professionally.  Whenever you have a mix of casual and tournament environments you have to strike a balance.  In general, the FAQ is for people who want to play at the tournament level, or at least at that level of intensity.  

 

If you want to play at home you really need to view everything, including the rule book and FAQ, as a template.  Make of it what you want to make of it.  

 

MMOs, such as World of Warcraft, particularly have a problem with this balance since they don't have the luxury of a "home player".  They have to build rules and a world where the serious player and casual can both have a good time.  The great thing about playing a card game, or a board game, or any game at home is you can make up your own rules to make it more enjoyable for your play group.

 

Hell, without "house rules" we would be stuck with only regular poker instead of strip poker, and that would make the world a more depressing place...

I've got nothing against the downgraded versions of the most powerfull cards, because I don't think on this game as competitive. In my case is a good tactical choice to put in the deck 1 Unexpected Courage and 3 Steeds. I don't need to buy 2 other Core Sets.

 

About the errata, it should be used only to fix broken cards (like Blocking Wargs) and for clarification (like Feint or Narvi's Belt), not to make strong cards worse (like Protector of Lorien). The problem with this game seems to be in some step of the design process, where a card like Zigil Miner becomes one of the best resource generators in the game (not only the sphere), obviously unintended. But the interaction with Imladris Stargazer or Gildor is too obvious to consider it anything other than a mistake. The same goes for Beravor. Master of Lore was probably errated to avoid any future infinite loop. But once they are released, I shouldn't rush to change their text. If competitive play would ever grow strong (I think it will never happen), a simple banned or restricted list (as in A Game of Thrones) should be enough.

I don't agree with this.

 

First, Tomb is event, Map is attachment, their effects and using are different.

 

Second, they could be affect by different encounter card(discard players' event card or attachment), so the value of the two cards will change via different quest.

 

Finally, I can pick them both in deck: tomb and map, UC and SotM, Daughter of the Nimrodel [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/core/daughter-of-the-nimrodel-core]

and Self Preservation [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/core/self-preservation-core]...

 

However, I like to see various cards always to make various deck idea, that's what we want in LCGs.

I don't really care either way. I don't like errata because then you have to keep track of them, but in some cases it can be a necessary evil. If I ran tournaments I would probably make special limiting rules for them just to help encourage creativity. I really don't care if a card is powerful enough that just about every deck will want it in there, but I like people to try to be creative. The cards don't break the game, just railroad deck-building.

I agree with you. Sure there are some cards that are stronger than others but if you tinker with deck and card combos for a while you will eventualy find a super-strong combo and because of this many cards get collateral damage, like Thror's Map i just hate that its action can only be done in the travel phase but the combo of it with Path of Need was the thing that got it errated. Master of Lore also suffered this with that crazy Erebor Hammersmith deck that came a while ago. But on general i don't have problems with super powerful combos because i like to make thematic decks (really thematic) and it is rare to find such combos with themwd decks (Dain is an exception but i don't use him and Outlands need the support of many other cards to make it work so it is not entirely thematic).

Exactly how I play!

I don't foresee myself ever playing in a LotR LCG tournament or competing at all for that matter.  I play by myself or with a friend or two simply for the experience.  However, I can see the point of this topic as well: to discuss cards that are just plain bad or ones we would never use (like Power in the Earth)

 

As far as errata go, I'll be honest... I do not follow any of the updates they send out on them.  I play the game with the exact texts on the cards I have and don't bother updating the ones that have been altered.  With that said, it's not my goal to make the most powerful or cheap decks possible.  My chief source of enjoyment in this game is creating themed decks that I can tackle quests with.  Whether that be eagles, Elves, Rohan, Gondor, Hobbits, or anything else, that's what I enjoy doing.  Now, some themed decks are just naturally better than others, and it just so happens that Dwarves are both powerful and my favorite to play with.  Anyways, sorry to get a bit off topic, but that's my viewpoint on that.

I'm interested in this. The only idea I kept were using homemade objective cards.

Race against the shadow was a bad experience. I've never seen positives reviews, or reviews at all ?

 

> What if the there was a collaborative forum based created set of additional rules/erratas? Would this be helpful, for people wanting changes? That it wasn't just your own house rules - Then people could choose to play easy mode, normal mode or forum mode?

 

This seems the best solution. If it needs to be official, a fan group can submit theirs to validation. It would simplify the job.

 

 

> I really wouldn't mind if they made errata that are only used for tournaments. In that case they could errata every single card.

 

Also, this is why I love fancard. I'm making my own cards in an alternate universe, so I only reuse the mechanism.

 

This would be the list of leadership CS cards that I would change... imagine if I have to do that for everything... like power in the earth, favor of the lady, daughter of the nimrodel, gandalf's search, beorn hospitality..........

Guard of the Citadel : +1 def, +1 hit point, sentinel 

Son of Arnor : -1 cost

Silverlode Archer : -1 cost

Faramir : limit 1 per phase

Longbeard Orc Slayer : +1 def or -1 cost

Brok Ironfist : -2 cost 

Steward of Gondor : comes into play tapped

Ever Vigilant : -1 cost or "all player"

 

I think the best future for evolutive card game is print on demand cards. Where you can buy only the cards you want, and errata can be reprinted easilly.

That is the point.  All errata is only for official play...

 

If you want to run tournaments, and you own a comic/card shop or setup events at conventions you will need to follow the FAQ and have some version of an "Oracle" text with you to help people with rulings.  If you try to have special limitations in these tournaments you will probably fail miserably unless it is on a tiny scale because people playing at their local store that want to play in your store will want to play by a standard set of rules.

 

Tournament players will exploit every little opening they can in deck construction/rules to get an edge.  That's just how it is in any competition, and that's why we have errata and updated rulings in the FAQ.  I don't see LOTR LCG ever taking off as a competitive game, but if FFG wants it to be a possibility they have to try to keep the balance.  

 

If you play at home do whatever you want.

I just wish that FFG would make reprints of errata'd cards. If they're going to change them, they should at least make it official by having them in print, and it's more money for them anyway! It just gets hard to memorize all of these erratas.

 

At least put the new versions of cards in reprinted packs. It was confusing to me that they changed the Nazgul card and a couple other encounter cards from the new prints of the core set but did not change Beravor or the other errata'd player cards.

 

What would be really cool is if they did an adventure pack with all the errata'd cards in it!

1st (I don't know if this was directed at me but if it is then) I didn't mean to tell anybody off. If it feels like that through my writing it was not intended that way. I was just giving my opinion like you guys. (If not directed at me ignore this)

 

2nd I did not state I disobey the rules. I said you could if you'd like, and nobody would notice, or care.

For the record, we play by every rule, and follow every errata.

I only indicated that with our house rules we just restrict ourselves: power cards are limited 1 per deck at our table, and presented it here as an option for use, like GrandSpleen noted.

This from of house ruling is in no way bending the rules of the game itself. So there is no spoil or empty victory.

 

Now I know you are not calling for errata; but as I read the replies on the subject you did hit a sensitive spot.

And there are some very good points brought up I must say. Good discussion.

Yet, as always, if you (even seem to) endanger peoples freedom (even in something minor as in use of cards for example) you might get feedback you won't like; or understand even as other people think different.

As there's no paradox here :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I have zero desire to play this game in tournament. If I want to play a tournament I'll play Magic, Game of Thrones, or any of the other competitive games. BUT.... I can see how some people would want to play this game in tournament and for them I think there needs to be a FAQ and errata. Which is exactly why FFG is doing that. They clearly have no plans to create a competitive scene for this game but are going the distance for those who want to do it on their own. 

 

Personally I'll do whatever works best for me and my friends. For example, I totally ignore the errata on Master of Lore. It's fine as it is. I've put my own errata in place for Keeping Count and now it works like the Fili/Kili combo. I've also errataed Sleeping Sentry by removing it from the game and pretending it doesn't exist  :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

I play this game to have fun and if something is broken I'll fix it. If it's not, I'll leave it alone. That's the greatest joy of a cooperative game, you have the flexibility to make it be whatever you want it to be.

The only errata and FAQ in existence are for official organized play. Unofficial errata is for when you want to ignore the FAQ at home or make home rules to make it more fun for yourself. You have the luxury of ignoring whatever you want at home.  There will never be such a thing as rules for home play and rules for tournament play.  There are rules, FAQ entries and errata, and if you aren't playing at a sanctioned event you can play however you like. 

 

If you want to make a homemade Han Solo hero with all 20's for stats and 1 threat you are welcome to it...

Yes it is true. You didn't ask that Steed or Map be made better; you want the other cards to be made worse. Where would it end? Warden of Healing is better than Daughter of Nimrodel; a number of cards are just staples in their respective spheres.

 

In a game with an ever-growing pool of cards, there are going to be great cards, there are going to be average cards, and there are going to be bad cards. It's just how it is. I would love for all of the cards made for this game to be viable options, but the truth is so few of the cards are really playable in a "best-deck" situation.

 

I apologize if I respond a little strong, but I've seen poor, knee-jerk reactions made off random message board posts in other games like this before because no one took what was happening or being complained about seriously.

This is the tournament concept I have been working on. At the start of the event, the judge announces which scenario will be used. Two two-player teams sit down at each table. Each round is one hour, with the amount of time for each time evenly split at 30 minutes.

 

The teams roll off to see who will play their quest decks first. The other team is the "shadow team." Proceed with normal setup, have the first team draw six cards, and when they are ready to begin, the shadow team draws 3 cards off the top of the encounter deck. Once during the staging step, the shadow team may play one of the 3 cards instead of revealing an encounter card. The shadow team has 10 seconds to decide to play a card.

 

When Revealed effects trigger as though the card were revealed from the encounter deck. If an encounter card requires players to search for a card, the shadow team may replace 1 search with 1 card that matches the requirements of the search. During the combat phase, the shadow team may assign any of the cards in their hand as the shadow cards to eligible enemies. At the end of the combat phase, the shadow team puts all of the cards in their hand on the bottom of the encounter deck and draws 3 new cards.

 

Scoring is based on the following system:

Add up final threat totals, and subtract the result from 100. Then add 5 points for each damage token on a hero, and subtract 1 point for each ally in play. The team with the lowest score wins. Tie breakers are determined by which team took the least amount of time to complete the quest. If a team feels the shadow team is intentionally stalling the game to run them out of time, the quest players should immediately call for a judge to report a slow play concern.

Reading this topic, pretty thouroughly, I realise many commenters miss a very important fact : This game is new.

 

Yes, card games have existed since more than 20 years now, but the way LOTR LCG works is totally unique (and remains the only one in its category).

 

When you design a whole new game, there obviously will be some flaws and OP interactions that occur and were not intended.

If you've played MtG, you know what I'm talking about when I say Mox, Lotus, Tolarian Academy...

 

Early mistakes are normal and are being corrected on quaterly basis (more or less), this is more that we can hope for, other designers wouldn't be so active.

 

When it comes to the topic of bad single card designs, I don't agree Maps and Tomb are badly designed. They don't do the same thing at all and can even work together.

 

I think of ally Denethor or the new Ship Captain of Pelargir when I think of bad design. In a LCG, unplayable cards are sad since the pool is more restricted than in TCGs and there's no real draft or limited system to give them some kind of use. Iconics characters on very bad cards is even sadder I believe.

I agree with most of the above. I find it natural that mistakes happen.

 

I do not agree that Map and Tomb are different enough so that the Map has any chance of challenging the Tomb. But maybe it will come.

 

I was also sad to see Denethor as bad as he turned out in his ally form. I might still try and implement him nonetheless, but it is definitely a shame when such an icon comes up short. As for the Ship Captain, I see no point there: the card is quite good, certainly on the better side of the cycle in terms of power (just compare it to Guard of the Citadel from the core set, same stats but the Captain has a possibly quite useful ability).

The Map encourages mono-Spirit, it then becomes way more powerful and makes expensive Events really cheap. It also targets only events while Tomb can target any Spirit card.

 

You're quite right when saying that it's one of the most powerful card in the cycle for Leadership, and that's a big problem for this sphere: any new ally is utter crap. It's true that this sphere has the edge on attachment and other awesome cards, but it's getty annoying to see no playable ally. The Ship Captain is basically a worse Envoy of Pelargir (so many heroes are Noble...), and, well, this one is colorless. How can you justify a Leadership ally is worse than a colorless one? :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Have you tried a Gondor Leadership deck? I suggest you do. Boromir, Imrahil, Théodred. Then Leadership allies from HoN and AtS (no Outlands of course), Gandalf, perhaps Dúnedain Watcher - works nice with Imrahil, Sneak, Tale, Sacrifice, Wealth, Strength of Arms, even For Gondor! It is a very, very good deck once you insert Visionary Leadership. With Boromir and 1 resource on him, Envoy of Pelargir is just super good (2 attack 2 willpower for one resource basically) and you've got other cheap guys like Errand-rider or the Squire. The Captain, too, he's very decent then. Just try it - especially once you pair it up with another mono-deck, you're going to have a blast against HoN and AtS.

How does the Map of Earnil make events cheaper? The card text reads "as if the card were played from your hand", which means that you have to pay the cost of the card. What is good about those event recycling cards is that you get to play the event again and the event goes back into your deck, potentially letting you draw and play that event one more time. I think it is useful. And you get three copies from the AP it came in. There is only one copy of Dwarven Tomb in the Core Set.

> The other comparison, Unexpected Courage and Steed of the Mark. This one may be even more extreme. Steed is cheaper by 1 but to use it, you already lose the resource advantage the first time you use it. Then, the use is way more limited, with the Courage a hero can do any two actions, be it quest, combat or ability. With the Steed he can only quest and do one more thing (afterwards). This is already a huge difference but it goes far further. For some reason the much more able card, the Courage, has no restrictions, and can be played on any hero, whilst the Steed can only be attached to Gondor or Rohan heroes.

So where's the problem, you see it, the Courage.

Yeah, I saw it. It was funny. After the initial "Wow, this is incredible" - the ever reaction to seeing a new card, there came the not so oft "Well, how does this actually...?"

 

And I was glad to hear there will be Mount synergies. They can really make such a card even better. But as I was saying, I do not think the Steed is actually bad - just that Courage is so good. Now, to advocate against myself - I can imagine running two Rohan Tactics heroes (such as Théoden and Éomer) and Dúnhere of Spirit. Well, the Steed can be attached to Théoden on round 1, and be used on round 1 - something which would hardly be possible with the Courage. And yes, the round 1 can change the whole thing with Théoden's extra action available. And surely in such a deck, Tactics resources might be more plentiful than Spirit ones.

Yeah totally misread the card, I thought maps made the event free to play. Anyway, the fact that there's a blue one makes sense because it's a cycle. It would've been strange to skip it.

This is a great topic, and there's a lot of thoughtful discussion here. I definitely think a case could be made for certain early cards being so powerful that they restricted the future design space in a significant way. With the design teams changing several times and with this game being so new, I think some messiness is inevitable. On the one hand, with so few player cards being released each cycle, we probably don't want to see card space wasted on weaker versions of older cards. On the other hand, I like that certain cards from the Core Set are truly "core", in the sense of providing a base that players of all levels can build from. I don't like the idea of them nerfing older cards, but would prefer just very carefully considered design of future cards.

## 63 [lleimmoen on November 23, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93680-bad-card-designs-part-1/?do=findComment&comment=915059)

Thanks Raven, I actually agree with much of that. When I think about it though, I would really like the strongest cards to be associated with a single faction only - that way the card doesn't appear in every deck of the sphere. Like Elrond's Counsel, it is a very powerful card but you cannot just splash it anywhere. Same with King Under the Mountain. These are very clever designs, I find.

I've been thinking more about this since first reading this topic. It's not just early design that restricted design space. Every time we get something that is tier 1, it locks out other similar creations if they don't measure up. One example that stands out for me is the Warden of Healing. I have gone back and forth over buying a second copy of the encounter pack it's in so that my partner can run 3 of them alongside mine. I would have little use for any of the other cards in the set so I can't justify it. I don't really know what the solution is. You either play theme and take your chances that you aren't just going through the motions before you lose, or you play strategically and focus on solid deckbuilding to handle each quest based on its specific challenges. Low threat, card draw, good mix of quest and combat - those are all at the core of each good deck, obviously. From there you either cancel everything you can or accept what the encounter deck throws at you and hope for the best.

 

I'm not really sure what the solution is in a game like this, where power creep is handled at a slow rate overall because it sells more packs. But I do believe that - as was demonstrated for the first time with Warhammer Invasion - that the LCG format is a self-defeating one due to the fact that getting the good cards is quite cost-prohibitive. You have the choice of buying everythng in each pack multiple times or limiting yourself to what you need for your own deck and nothing else. When you play this game with family members, you have to divide your card pool if you can't or won't buy more. I bought 3 cores for this reason, as the three-player deck relies on 3 Test of Wills and Hasty Strokes, but that's as far as I've been willing to go with it.

I agree that this is an very interesting and important topic. I especially like lleimmoen's observation about cards like Elrond's Counsel and King Under the Mountain. I think that trait-specific cards are definitely the way to go - both in terms of avoiding over-powered cards, as well as keeping a good separation between the various factions/traits.

 

Gondorian Shield is an example of a newer card that embodies these concepts. I like that it can be used by anyone, but it truly becomes a game-changing card when paired with one specific trait. This strikes not only a balance from a game-mechanics standpoint, but from a thematic one as well.

 

Conversely, Steward of Gondor should cost at least 3 resources, and probably require the Gondor trait rather than give it. I would like to see other, less powerful resource generation effects be introduced for other traits, but the existence of Steward of Gondor as an attachment open to all heroes definitely seems to discourage this.

I agree with you, but the reason I singled out the early cards is because I expect us to get at last some tier 1 cards today with the inevitability of power creep. But getting such strong cards in the core set is a whole different beast, restricting design space from the get go. I'm not sure if I would agree about the LCG model. Warhammer had a good run but all things must come to an end at some point, LCG or no, and the old CCG model still takes the cake in terms of cost prohibitive. I can empathize in terms of needing more copies of those essential cards though, and maybe the problem is we just dont get that many player cards, and could use more options.

Sorry, my fingers were working faster than my brain. I meant to say "Gondorian Shield", but "Spear of the Mark" is a good example as well. While it is true that Steward of Gondor is unique, it is so powerful, and has zero drawback, so it seems to be putting a serious downward pressure on any repeatable or attachment-based resource generation for other traits. I can definitely see limiting resource generation to the Leadership sphere, that makes thematic and mechanical sense. At the same time, I would prefer a metagame where Steward of Gondor was not quite so powerful, and there were other Leadership options for Dunedain and Noldor - just as there are for Dwarves with Thorin, Gloin (both versions) and We are Not Idle.

I think the easiest fix, indeed, would be if Steward of Gondor required the Gondor trait (instead of giving it). It has been said many times, and it would be a very nice thematic way to prevent it from appearing in every deck. Gondor would have then been quite unique already (not that it isn't in a way, but it would be more).

## 70 [Nerdmeister on November 30, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93680-bad-card-designs-part-1/?do=findComment&comment=919845)

Another point I would like to make for Steward of Gondor is that in multiplayer it can be beneficial if you build your decks in a specialised manner.

For leadership, in our group, that means you are the one responsible for all other players having enough ressources to play around with. In that regard, leadership has some abilities to move ressources away from their own heroes and onto the heroes of other players.

By having SoG be unique that means that, even though it produces +2 ressources every round, those ressources have to be split among other 1-3 other players.

Just a small point that I think bears mentioning

This is the perspective of a casual player that plays the game for fun at home, but that follows every rule and every errata to the letter. House ruling would kind of ruin the gaming experience for me. I find this thread really interesting and I like the ideas that are being discussed. It convinced me to sign to the site to give my 2 cents hehe.

 

I think we should wait to see what the traits of  Map of Eärnil and Steed of the Mark will have to offer with the new cycle before jumping to the conclusion that these cards are weaker version of Dwarven Tomb and Unexpected Courage. Imagine if you had an ally that would allow you to search your deck for any Record card when played from you hand (like the Rivendell Minstrel for songs), that would be an added advantage of Map of Eärnil over Dwarven Tomb. Of course, this is just an example. What I mean is that Unexpected Courage and Dwarven Tomb are great Core cards, but their power is somewhat set in stone, while Map of Eärnil and Steed of the Mark, with their traits, still have a potential to become great cards in the future.

 

As it is now, I run with both Map of Eärnil and Dwarven Tomb and kind of like the combo to be honest. Being able to use Map of Eärnil to use a discarded Dwarven Tomb to put any Spirit card into my hand, and put back Dwarven Tomb into my deck is kind of sweet I think. And I am not even mentioning that I could fetch back my Map of Eärnil with Second Breakfast if needed since it is an attachment.

Here's one major difference between the Map and the Tomb...

 

With the Map, I believe you can grab and use a Response event from your discard pile - like a cancel card - in response to a just-triggered effect.  The Tomb is an action, so you would need to have used it before the event you need to cancel.  This came up in a game for me and cost us a victory.

 

It may be costlier, but the Tomb has its uses.  This assumes that the Tomb can in fact be played that way.

 

Another point I'd like to make is that "weaker" versions of existing effects are not useless because they provide additional opportunities to use these great effects.  Imagine a 3 cost "Steward of Gondor" variant.  Who wouldn't pack those in their deck along with the original - just sayin.

I think it is an Action to discard the Map and use it. So I believe you can't use it to play a Response event like Test of Will.

I think you meant Map instead of Tomb? Also, the Map is not costlier than the Tomb when in a mono sphere deck, which is a thing the developers wanted to promote in this cycle.

 

Also, they kind of had to add a Record card of that type for Spirit since they did it for all other spheres...that would have been awkward if only spirit was left out because of the Tomb...

Correct you are.  I meant Map.  ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

 

As for the playing of the Map's effect, you have a good point, but I figured the text on the card to be played would certainly need to dictate the timing or it is a severely limited card - you could never use it to recycle a response effect.  I may try to get a designer decision on that one.

## 75 [danpoage on December 10, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93680-bad-card-designs-part-1/?do=findComment&comment=927732)

You are correct, the "Book" attachments cannot be used to play "Response" events in your discard pile as though they were in your hand. The reason is simple: the trigger has already passed. For example, take A Test of Will. Because the Map of Earnil is an Action, the window for responses to the When Revealed effect of a treachery has already passed. If you trigger the action on the map, the response window has closed for the When Revealed effect on the treachery.

 

Actions start a new effect chain (which may or may not then have subsequent response), whereas responses are always made in reaction to the appropriate trigger. When a trigger happens, you have to perform any and all Responses immediately. Once any player performs an action (assuming actions are even allowed at that step in the phase), the window for responses to that particular trigger is closed.

## 76 [leptokurt on December 11, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93680-bad-card-designs-part-1/?do=findComment&comment=928224)

Welll, if one day we would get a card that has a reaction that allows you to immediatly play an action, we could use a Map's action to trigger the reaction of an event card in the discard pile.
