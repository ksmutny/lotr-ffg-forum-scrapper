Just found this link:

Apparantly this year's GenCon Event will be a custom scenario kit about the Mines of Moria, again with competitive and cooperative modes like last year's Wizard's Quest and Woodland Realm.

It seems, they will continue using cards from older cycles and remake them into new ones, which partly make sense, as these older encounter sets are rather inconsistent with partly crazy efffects (Sudden Pitfall, anyone?). On the other hand I would like to see some new scenarios like The Scouring of the Shire.

Agree with you. Would be nice to see scouring but I feel like that would be the final pack after the Mordor cycle maybe?
