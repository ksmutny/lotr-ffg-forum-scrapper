Can i have a little guidance please regarding the Wandering Took. In one player mode, when you put him into play, is his threat reduction a "dead effect"  as there is no other player to pass him to OR can you put him into play then put him on the discard pile to trigger the threat reduction?  If its the former, the stats on his profile doesnt fill you with much encouragement to take the little fella along with you. (Even though the artwork is amazing)

i would say its useless- i mean you have to raise the other plays threat by 3 - so even if you could somehow get the action to work- it would just be -3 then +3 threat, so no change

 

i just use him because i love the theme of it- gotta love me some halflings

Dont think i will include him on a solo quest next time then even though im a halfling fan myself. Maybe more hobbit heroes will appear in the future!! I can picture a Lobelia Sackville-Baggins card with awesome stats and a scowl that would make a hill troll scarper!

## 4 [radiskull on February 12, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60370-wandering-took/?do=findComment&comment=593402)

 Putting him on the discard pile to trigger the threat reduction is pure wishful thinking.

While its effect is useless in a single-player game, Wandering Took has pretty decent stats for a 2-cost Spirit ally. 1-1-1 with 2 health makes it plenty versatile for a cheap price. I don't know that I'd use it over some of the comparable Rohan allies (West Road Traveller, Westfold Horse-Breaker, etc.), but it's never a dead card.

## 7 [booored on February 13, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60370-wandering-took/?do=findComment&comment=593597)

I think woundering took is one of the true ulsess cards at the moment.. it has zero utility and the draw should be replaced with a card that dose something. Still there may be a time it will be good.. like Keen-eyed is also crap, but could defiantly find play with that new monster about to come... my point is yes he is complete crap... do not use him.. but keep his effect in mind as at any time a new AP will give us a use for him

 Hmm,

of course his ability is a blank in single player mode...

But he is so versatile in multiplayer, he essentially has:

 

1) Ragend

2) Sentinel

3) Threat manipulation

4) Dark Knowledge+ (defend an attack, resolve the Shadow card as defended, move the Took, take the damage undefended. Though the jury still seems to be out on this one)

 

I'm really a big fan of this card for 2+ players.

1,2 yes... but attack of 1 is no good, and a chump block has its use... but as has been said, there are other cards with the same cost that are just a ton better. Like Gondorian Spearman for example. What I am saying here is that he is a wasted draw when compared to other 2 drops for spirit, and the other spheres alos have much better 2 drops.

3 - please tell me when this threat effect is ever useful?

4 - This dose work. You have a action phase after shadow cards are revealed but before the attack resolves. There is no "jury" on this... it is in the rules in black and white. Also in the rules is there is no stacking.. meaning that if you activate teh ability the attack is as if it was 100% undefended.. dmg has to go on a hero and any "undefended" effects are countedstill seems to be out on this one)

When we just had core and a pack or two of mirkwood, I could see using Wandering Took (spirit just didn't have that many 2-cost allies). At the moment, I see no reason to run him in anything other than a thematic deck

You are certainly right, that Gondorian Spearman is a more useful defender than the Wandering Took. But that is not my point.

The Spearman is a better defender, but the Took is better at questing or attacking.

The West Road Traveller is a better quester, but the Took is a better attacker or defender.

The Veteran Axehand is a better attacker, but ...

I think you see what I am trying to get at. The usefulness of the Took is about his flexibility for me.

How is that supposed to work? Elfhelm cannot reduce the threat increase from the Tooks ability. Or am I missing something?

I skimmed it but there is a lot of text for what look like fairly average deck list to me. As I said above I really can not see why you would run this card instead of the other better more useful 2 drops. I still do not see what you are talking about if it isn't the resource engine.

Well, the strategic premise in that article is to build 2 decks with a high/low threat split. (In order to get all enemies on one side of the table).

People might not agree that the premise is a good one, but within that strategic decision, the Took is a useful card, is it not?

## 19 [Sprenger on February 13, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60370-wandering-took/?do=findComment&comment=593807)

I think he will be very useful with the new secrecy cards. If you are running 3 of the Tooks you can give them to other players to reduce your threat by 9 during your planning phase then get them back on the same turn. As long as the other players can handle the temperary threat increase you should be able to pay for the secrecy cards and still be able to run 3 heroes.

People mwell that is nearly how every 2 player deck is designed.



This is the 1st and most obvious strategy when people start building decks, witch is why nearly all of the 2player decks posted use this idea. he point though is the wandering took and if he has any real use.. you speak of utility but at what cost.. is a card that is mediocre / next to useless at everything worth the draw slot of a card that is extremely powerful or dose one of what the took dose but very well worth it.. the answer is no.ght not agree that the premise is a good one, but within that strategic decision, the Took is a useful card, is it not?

If this is true, witch I doubt (I'm sending in my own rule clarification now) it is a 100% reversal of the rules states as they are know as of the FAQ. There has been Nate responses on a number of effects that say the removal of defender makes the attack undefended.

Dark and Dreadful
Undisturbed Bones
A Foe Beyond
Cut Off

Just off the top of my head... also it meas you can do things like block with Horse breaker, then sac it for the effect and the attack is still undefended...

All of these are not tuire.. or at least are not ture as of teh FAq ... if this IS a true ruling (witch I doubt) it is a 100% reversal of how the game is working now and I hope this isn't true as it is a complete **** up from the designer .. once again making everyone scores invalid.

## 23 [radiskull on February 14, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60370-wandering-took/?do=findComment&comment=593982)

 The difference between your examples and the Took is that your examples remove the defender from play.  Wandering Took is still in play, just under the control of a different player.

I'll be honest, it's not the ruling I expected, but it is playable.  It is substantively different from other shadow effects that remove a defender from play before damage is assigned.

I have no reason to doubt that this is an official ruling.  You just doubt its veracity because you don't like it.

## 24 [booored on February 14, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60370-wandering-took/?do=findComment&comment=594001)

that is true... this "could" be a difference.. but if this IS the rules.. and I'm going to get my own confirmation.. then it raises all sorts of questions about the damage stack.. something with the game is not meant to have... Like if this took thing is real.. then what happens when you declare a blocker, reveal the shadow card and then player 2 sneak attacks a Son of Arnor for example.

I actually think the Wandering Took ruling informs other similar situations, including the one you presented. It seems that, once an attack begins and a defender is declared, the participants (enemy and ally) are "locked in" unless one or the other leaves play. Wandering Took will still be the defender if it changes control midway through an attack. So--and here I extrapolate a little, though hopefully within reason--removing a character or enemy from play can change the execution of an initiated attack, but simply moving them around on the table will not.

So, in the Son of Arnor example, the attack has already been initiated by the time Sneak Attack is played. Based on the Took ruling, I'm inclined to say that the attack would simply continue against the original defender. Even though the enemy is the one moving around in this instance, both participants in the attack are still on the board. I don't see any reason why engaging the enemy with SoA would break off the attack.

## 27 [Mattr0polis on February 14, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60370-wandering-took/?do=findComment&comment=594187)

I don't mind the Wandering Took. I don't use him very often but he has proven useful in the past. Mainly as a bail-out to help a teammate in an emergency as a sac-blocker. Spirit just has nothing Sentinel or Ranged. Wandering Took is a different way you can help.

And Plueschi and others are correct, his stats do make him pretty versatile. When he's not needed as a wandering sac-blocker, there's a few times where a teammate will be just 1 attack away from killing an enemy and you can send him over as well. Or if needed, help quest.

There are indeed some "better" allies for the same cost, but every card has it's uses. It just depends on what your deck needs.

Very well thought, my friend.

In 2-player mode, one deck being focused on battle and another on quest (with secrecy cards) this idea could be a really nice strategy.

I submitted this question to Nate last August, and he ruled that the attack would proceed against the NEW defender in that case.  So it appears we have one standard for allies and another for enemies.  That's not inherently problematic, but I'd like to see it in the FAQ at some point.

Interesting. Just to be clear, I meant "defender" as "defending character," though I don't think that changes your response. If a hero or ally has already been declared as a defender before SoA comes into play via Sneak Attack, but the attack then proceeds against the player with whom the enemy is newly engaged, does the attack simply go undefended? The chance to select a defender has already passed.

In any event, both this and the Took scenario definitely warrant inclusion in the FAQ.

I like the Wandering Took. As has been mentioned it's a low-cost, versatile card with an ability that I've used to good effect in multi-player games.

exactly, in every other instant in the game, if there is an attack, and through some effect the attacker is moved or the defender disappears the attack becomes undefended.

So this wandering thing is a rule anomaly... wtf... that is lame..

and it makes no sense... the monster swings his club, the took disappears and appears elsewhere AND it still hits him.. lame...

Granted the other versions of this the cards are getting removed form play, but the sons of arnor effect dose indicate that the attack is relevant to position.. why is the defence.. different.. why?

I am still waiting for the response.. but if this is a real rule then is is just another example of these guys making bad game rule decisions.

Sorry to dig up this "old' post, but I've just read from the Official Nate Rule Clarification thread over cardgamedb.com that the part about Took has been answered officially.  Re-reading this thread Rediskull mentioned the official answer for Son of Arnor, too; however, that answer has not been consolidated into the cardgamedb thread.  Would you, Rediskull, mind posting the original question and answer between you and Nate so that it can be added to the above thread? It would be very helpful since the rulings seems to be quite confusing, being different from Enemies to Allies.  Thank you very much.

## 35 [radiskull on March 3, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60370-wandering-took/?do=findComment&comment=601675)

 I'm happy to repost it, but it's possible that the reason it didn't make it into the subsequent FAQ is that the design team changed their mind about how it was supposed to work.  It's entirely possible that this answer will be superseded in the future, especially given the recent ruling about Wandering Took.  With that caveat, here's my question and Nate's answer, from 12 Aug 2011:

Q:
I had a question about attack resolution:

Player 1 is engaged by a Nazgul. The Nazgul is dealt a shadow card, declared as attacker, and Gandalf defends. The shadow card is revealed and has a shadow effect. After the effect resolves, Gandalf is chosen to be discarded.

At this point, player 2 attempts to save player 1 and plays Sneak Attack to get Son of Arnor into play. Son of Arnor's response triggers and player 2 engages the Nazgul before damage is dealt.

It's pretty clear that the Nazgul's attack is now undefended, but against whom? Is it player 1, who was attacked originally, or is it player 2, who is now engaged with the Nazgul? Or is it door number three, where the attack simply fizzles?

 

A:
There are 4 steps to enemy attack resolution, and event cards/ actions can be played at the end of each step (p. 18 core rulebook):

1. Choose an enemy.

2. Declare defender.

3. Resolve shadow effect.

4. Determine combat damage.

In your example, Sneak Attack/ Son of Arnor would have to be played after step 3. Damage will then be determined against the new player with whom the Nazgul is engaged.

(Once step 4 begins, there is no opportunity to play an action until it has resolved.)

 

Booored, I have to say, and I'm speaking only for myself here, but your constant sharp negativity is beginning to become rather tiresome.  Is there a chance you could try to be a bit more constructive and more than a bit more polite?  Telling someone new to the forums that tournaments "are never gonna happen" and that the "rules are ****" makes this community look like every other forum community on the internet.
