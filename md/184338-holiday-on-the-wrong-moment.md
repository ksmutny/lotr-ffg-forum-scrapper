Hey all!

 

I recently went on a holiday (during Gen Con) and I might have missed some things.

 

For people who also missed some news, here is a summary:

 

We received spoilers from The Land of Shadow, the fourth Saga box. It was also available at GenCon:

Escape from Mount Gram, the second AP of the Angmar Awakened cycle was released:

There is also the annual GenCon quest. The quest is called The Ruins of Belegost and it somewhat resembles the Dwarrowdelf cycle quest in ambiance.

Your goal is to (as far as I understood it) secure loot and the loot you secure lead to a different path in different combinations. Meanwhile, a dragon is trying to roast you.

 

Any news that I missed, feel free to comment and I'll add it. Thanks in advance.
