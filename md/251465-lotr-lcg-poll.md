Wasn't sure either, but I went with the idea that it is "everything that could remind me of a long reptile" aka some kinds of dragons (for counter-example: Smaug would NOT), some enemies in a specific AP of the ringmaker cycle, which I can't spell right and am to lazy to look up :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] or even the watcher in the water.

I am sorry if I misunderstood this point, but I couldn't really come up with a decent amount of enemies to choose from...

I believe this search includes all of the snakes: http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR?CardType=Enemy&Trait=Creature. [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR?CardType=Enemy&Trait=Creature.]

I still don't get why everyone spells this as "Fued". Was there some joke behind that? Yes, I'm a spelling nut.

Holy... I just played beneath the sands yesterday and didn't even think about sand viper! Or strangling Python from the Mumakil. Or Rock Adder. Looks like I don't really pay attention to enemy names, the art is to shiny :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]
