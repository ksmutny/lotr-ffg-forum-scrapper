This combo is totally broken

## 3 [DukeWellington on August 30, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228896-an-unlikely-friendship/?do=findComment&comment=2391247)

I am so stoked for these cards. Not only do they go well together in a way that opens up strong thematic three hunter decks (tons of them), but they also multiply possibilities when you bring the already existing tactics versions into consideration. This looks like a homerun for FFG. They needed to make the second versions of Legolas and Gimli special in order to satisfy all those fans that wanted to build decks around the pair but couldn't and they did exactly that. I'm pretty impressed.

## 4 [John Constantine on August 30, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228896-an-unlikely-friendship/?do=findComment&comment=2391257)

I'm sincerely glad they didn't limited the beneficial effects on them to just two names - Legolas and Gimli, but just provided little bonuses on top of the main effect for them.

 

Dwarven Shield is kinda cool. I wish Gloin had more than 1 base defense to be able to make more of it. Oh well.

 

Mirkwood Long-knife kind of baffles me, as there are currently no Spirit Silvan heroes, and Legolas is going to be the first one when Sands of Hard release.

## 5 [DukeWellington on August 30, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228896-an-unlikely-friendship/?do=findComment&comment=2391287)

Yes, both new versions will also be good in many decks that don't feature the pair. I agree about the Long-knife, but it is so good on Haldir. You can splash blue in a Silvan deck to run LoV anyway, maybe it would be good on Celeborn. It's definitely a good card, just a bit of color. Hey, remember when only red had weapons and armor?

Just out of curiosity why do you like the Long Knife on Haldir?

I personally would prefer Bow of the Galahadrim and Rivendell Blade putting him on 4/5 attack and -2 to enemy defence or alternatively a Bow of the Galahadrim and a Dagger of Westernesse putting him anywhere from 5 to 7.

Is it so you can then put wingfoot on him and quest for 4 then attack for 5 as well?

Also no one has commented on the art yet. What is with the new version of Gimli.....? I don't dislike the art per say but boy is is different from what we normally get and a very unique take on both Dwarves in general and Gimli specifically. 
Also half the focus of the picture is on the building/construct behind him..

Art on Legolas is awesome although the snow looks a little weird.. 

The attachments are then the opposite. Mirkwood Long-Knife almost looks like a cartoon while Dwarven Shield looks amazing and is probably my favourite art on any weapon or armour attachment to date!

Art of Dwarven shield is so nice that I might even use it on decks with no dwarves  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] 

 

I noticed that Legolas is now a Scout in his spirit version, not a warrior as his tactics version. Maybe there are some cards that could make use of that too

I have to agree with you.

I don't like the Gimli art the Legolas and Long Knife art are ok and the Shield art is great.

 

But at least we don't get another tactics Theoden, Great art but a sub standard hero.

Are their stat boosts dependent on the other actually readying? Just wondering if Legolas is a viable target for Light of Valinor.

The text instructs us to ready a hero, we can't ready a ready hero, so for us to ready a hero, that hero must be preemptively exhausted.

The difference between Sam and these two gentlemen is that with Sam, he is "hardcoded" as a target of his effects, while with Gilmli and Legolas the effects of readying and selecting a target are intersected.

Silvan heroes spirit and attack:

 

Legolas 1/3

Mirlonde 2/2

Celeborn 3/2

Haldir 2/3

Rossiel 2[4]/1

Argalad 2/2 [spoiled]

 

Except for TaLegolas, none of them have a native match for better weapons than the new attachment, and all but Legolas are already 2+ wp and are well worth having LoV if some Noldor doesn't hog it first.

## 17 [dalestephenson on August 30, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228896-an-unlikely-friendship/?do=findComment&comment=2391662)

Argalad with Light of Valinor and Gimli is quite interesting, since he could quest, exhaust to remove threat and perhaps do direct damage, then be readied by Gimli's ability to attack.

Legolas is nice but it has that typical simple detail out of place (brown knife why?).

 

Gimli is a World of Warcraft dwarf. 

 

The shield is very PJ's The Hobbit and both it and the knife are way too Magical Fantasy for my tastes as a fan of the books.

 

Based on the art I won't be buying this pack.

Getting back to the art for a moment, it looks to me like Gimli is standing on the wall at Helm's Deep and Legolas is unaffected by the snow as the Fellowship attempts the high pass.

Well with the LoV and the Knife attached he can quest with 2, battle with 4 and discard card to ready another hero . I think it is fair enough :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I think these new cards look great! I'm surprised how no one has mentioned that this version of Gimli is sentinel, while the tactics hero version is not. Unless I am mistaken, this is the first (non-fellowship sphere) hero with a different keyword than other versions in different spheres (unless one of the Aragorns isn't sentinel, but I can't think of any that aren't). I wonder if that is going to be a new thing.

 

I think the long knives look great, and I can't wait to use them in my Silvan deck (Galadrial can pay for them for Celeborn, who as somebody already mentioned, can use LOV to both quest and attack). They're a little expensive, but that only makes sense to me for a weapon outside of tactics.

Tactics Aragorn is not a Sentinel. He also has different Traits (Dunedain Ranger Warrior) from Leadership (Dunedain Noble Ranger) and Lore Arargorn (Dunedain Ranger).

Dwarven shield can be good in a Gloin undefended attack deck. Typically you're looking for him to have two Citadel plates and Song of Wisdom so he can pay for Warden of Healing infinitely with Elrond. So you take two damage, gain two resources, heal two damage, spend two lore resources to ready Warden, repeat. Attach a Burning Brand to cancel shadow effects. With one Citadel Plate and one Dwarven Shield, you can actually net a resource from this combo. It has a lot of pieces, but could be interesting to play.

Something no one has noted yet:  Gimli and Legoals don't have to be in the same deck to trigger each other.  You could run Legolas in a Noldor/Silvan deck on one hand and Gimli in an all Leadership Dwarf deck on the other, and still benefit from the extra actions (and have an easier time triggering them).   Oh sure, it defeats the thematic fun of running a three hunters deck, and it goes against what the designers are trying to encourage in this cycle, but that way you can actually use their ranged and sentinel to help each other that way.

 

Love this design idea.  Unlike Elladan and Elrohir, you don't have to have them both on the table to be good, but it's better when you do. 

## 35 [Glowwyrm on August 30, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228896-an-unlikely-friendship/?do=findComment&comment=2392083)

Wish the knives could go on a Silvan character, but they're still nice to have.  I rarely run Tactics in my Silvan decks, and I always run Galadriel, so it's nice to have a way to boost attack without the red sphere.

## 36 [Bullroarer Took on August 30, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228896-an-unlikely-friendship/?do=findComment&comment=2392115)

I haven't proxied a card since Arwen (ally), but since I'm working on the saga box right now I can't resist.

I may even go back and work on some of the previous boxes with these two.

I just realized too, the days rising could go on gimli. If he takes damage, he gets the resource from the shield, if he doesn't, he gets the resource from the days rising.

Yeah once I realised the Gimli art was on the wall of Helm's Deep I instantly liked it a bit more. It is sort of a weird setting for his art piece though as the alternative art versions of Legolas and Gimli show them fighting side by side at Helm's Deep so it is strange to get the exact same setting for Gimli while we get a new setting for Legolas.

Either way both cool settings for the art.

I wonder how Tactics Aragorn, Tactics Legolas and Leadership Gimli as a combat deck would run....

include x3 quick strike and x3 Hands Upon the Bow (maybe x3 Battle Cry as well?) so you can still use Gimli's ability on Legolas. 

Unlikely Friendship still allows first turn Steward of Gondor on Gimli (into first turn Dwarven Shield or Steed of the North as well if you wish). Tactics allows for Ring Mail, Rivendell Blade etc and leadership allows for StwB, Steed of the North etc.

Tactics and Leadership is also the basis for a good Dunedain deck. 

Hmmmmmmmmm time to get building!

Edit: Gimli's ability is great on Tactigorn if you don't use it on Legolas allowing him to defend and then attack as well.. (and quest with Steed of the North).

> No one is put off by needing to discard a card/resource each turn to fuel their abilities? Love the abilities, but they seem expensive...

feel the same as you.  Unlikely Friendship is perfect in that it's all the things you need to fuel this for a turn, but to me, the combo is an all-or-don't bother, so you have the scenario of choosing who to send to the quest with no enemies in the staging area.

 

Legolas is still questing with a base 1 and must decide when he commits to ready a different hero, and you're not readying Gimli, i don't think it's worth it unless you also have a way to ready Legolas with something like Unexpected Courage or something.

even then, i feel i'd rather put UC on someone else and save my cards

 

that said, i like Gimli's ability though, even outside of Legolas.  1 resource to ready any hero when he defends is basically Coragorn's ability for any hero you want.  even if you don't use this on Legolas, that's pretty strong imo, and it's great for heroes like Glorfindel with high questing and attack/defence

## 43 [donkler on August 31, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228896-an-unlikely-friendship/?do=findComment&comment=2392780)

He seems designed specifically for splashing in Spirit/Silvan into a deck that uses other spheres and traits. Discarding cards is GOOD if you are the lone Spirit hero. It let's you reliably use Elven-Light from turn one. Exhausting him is pretty rough though, unless you put your one Light of Valinor on him, which is a good deal if he is the only elf you have. It seems like a good design. Using him on Theodred or Thalin seems pretty reasonable.

> No one is put off by needing to discard a card/resource each turn to fuel their abilities? Love the abilities, but they seem expensive...

Legolas is expensive if you don't have a spirit card that wants to be discarded.  But Legolas is a 1-wp, 3-attack ranged character -- he's not going to be questing *unless* it's worth a card to ready a questing hero.

 

Gimli's ability puts me off even less, since you only use it when you know you're going to need it.  Add that he's leadership and 1 resource doesn't seem bad.  Add that the Golden Shield/Day's Rising combo can generate a resource whenever Gimli defends, it *really* doesn't seem so bad.

 

Consider Elrohir for a moment, tied at the hip to his brother.  No one is put off by his ability, even though it costs one resource and can ready only himself (useful if he needs a second defense, less useful for his 2 attack).  Gimli has a similar ability, and can't ready himself, but he can ready any other hero on the table, and I think that's more powerful.

I'm in the process of actually converting a deck that runs Elrohir, Elladan and Tactics Aragorn to Tactics Legolas, Leadership Gimli and Tactics Aragorn and pretty much the main things that I need to change/include in the deck is extra readying effects and extra/alternative defense. Even though Elrohir can only ready himself there is no limit to his ability and he has an inherently higher base defense than Gimli (so long as you are running Elladan and why wouldn't you be). He is also a better recipient for attachments as he can receive Elven Mail, Cloak of Lorien etc. as well as the Steward/Shield combo. He too can receive Heir of Mardil and so long as he has Elven Mail attached he can receive day is rising as well.

Pretty much Gimli can defend once and then allow a second exhausted hero to ready and either defend or attack and thats it.

Elrohir can keep defending until he runs out of resources, 9 resources? 10 defenses if need be.

What I like about the ability is the little boost it gives to Legolas. Especially if he can then make additional attacks after receiving that boost and even more so if he already took part in Hands Upon the Bow or Quick Strike earlier in the turn rather than questing. He could potentially take out 3 foes in one turn similar to Elladan except he places progress each time he kills an enemy as well!

I defintely agree that Gimli's ability is a little better hence me using his new version but sticking with the old version of Legolas.

I play to essentially use Gimli's ability to ready Legolas only if he has been used for Hands Upon the Bow or Quick Strike and otherwise I will use it to ready Tactics Aragorn or Elrond across the table with Elven Mail attached so that they can perform additional defensive duties. If I defend with Elrond or Aragorn before Gimli they can perform an additional defense with Gimli's ability which is especially handy if Elrond has Burning Brand attached.

I plan to set up Gimli with Steward/Shield and Armoured Destrier so that he can defend multiple attacks each turn and discard shadow cards while at it whilst also readying Elrond, Legolas or Aragorn to defend an additional attack/perform an additional attack. Not going to use Dwarven Shield as Steward and Unlikely Friendship will generate more than enough resources on their own and I would rather the shadow discard and readying from Armoured Destrier anyway. When possible he will also receive UC to defend up to three attacks per turn (four with his readying of another hero).

Doesn't really compare to a loaded-up Elrohir but this way I can spend Leadership resources more quickly and more safely, will have more resource ramp and card draw through Unlikely Friendship and Legolas albeit his old version replaces Elladan to also provide progress while destroying foes although without inbuilt readying.

I can't remember, but is it legal to put Fellowship sphere cards in your deck in a non-saga quest and pay for them with A Good Harvest?

## 47 [dalestephenson on August 31, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228896-an-unlikely-friendship/?do=findComment&comment=2393323)

It's certainly true that Elrohir's ability to repeatedly ready and defend is an advantage over LeGimli, also his 3 starting defense (with his brother).  My point is that the resource cost for Elrohir's ability isn't really seen as a knock -- leadership resources are cheap, and 1 for readying isn't bad at all, if you need it.

 

Elrohir's edge in attachments is slight.  I'll grant that for a defender the ability to get an Elven Cloak is better than LeGimli's ability to add on Boots of Erebor, since defense is more valuable than HP.  Elven Mail Gimli doesn't need -- if you spend the same 2 resources on Dwarven Mail for gimli instead of Elven Mail for Elladan, you end up with the same 3 def/6hp/sentinel line for both, with one restricted slot used.  But Gimli has the advantage in being sentinel from the start, so doesn't have to wait for Elven Mail for Day's Rising (or less likely, Raven-winged helm). Elrohir's big advantage isn't in what's attached, it's how often he can use it once he's completely set up.

 

However, Elrohir's self-readying is just going to enable Elrohir defending, which is an improvement over LeGimli if what you need is another defense by Elrohir.  LeGimli's ability is better if you need defense for another deck, and Elrohir doesn't have sentinel yet, or if what you need is attacking, or if you don't actually need either an emergency defender *or* attacker, but have some hero with a useful power who is exhausted.  Just one resource and a garden variety defense, and Gimli can ready Elrond for Vilya, or Galadriel for card/threat reduction, or Gandalf/Cirdan for Narya, or LoDenethor for scrying, or Beravor for Cards.  You wouldn't construct a Elladan/Elrohir/LeGimli deck to turn Gimli into the designated defender, but I think Gimli's flexibility makes him more useful in a wider variety of decks.

Illegal. =(

 

I wonder, though, if you can in a Saga Adventure use A Good Harvest to declare for Fellowship resources to pay the cost for a non-Fellowship card that needs Fellowship resources (such as Overcome By Fear).

Action: Name a sphere. Until the end of the phase, you can spend resources of any sphere when paying for cards that belong to the named sphere.

 

You aren't paying for a card that belongs to that sphere, so no.

I mean art's really important to me too and these aren't my favorite for these characters but that's pretty extreme!

 

I like their abilities. Gimli's is obviously better without Legolas but I like putting LoV on Legolas with his knives. Anything that gets LoV off Glorfindel!

So I dug up the rules and Fellowship is considered a sphere, so I think Kakita's play is legal.

My play is "not intended".

That's one way to read it, and people who automatically buy every pack are welcome to do so.

 

I own probably half the expansions and to be honest that's enough. I've got plenty of quests to play through, so anything new has to be worth it. Based on the art alone, with no other considerations or judgements, this pack falls short for me (and I have bought packs solely for the art of specific cards before, although that was when the game was new and exciting). I feel no great urge to own WoW "Gimli" and a ugly knife.

By the way, Legoal being a Scout enables him to participate in a Scouting Party, where his willpower will actually matter during questing. Also, with dat Legolas we'll be able to build a full 3 Spirit Scouts deck (not sure if we should).

I kind of like Lanwyn/Argalad/Legolas with LoV on Legolas and using his ability to quest Argalad and then have him able to use his ability. A Spirit/Lore deck with some serious attack power!

so far, it's been rather terrible :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

but that said, the 3 Spirit scouts deck is really solid, since they can all attack for 3 and have some built-in readying effects

just need some defensive characters or some chump blockers, and you're golden

Hmm. I dunno. Aren't these two heroes a big chunk of "to specific"?? I guess there won't be any decks with just one of the heroes...

Besides: to which card the "he" refers to? The same card or the other?

it's very clearly an anaphoric reference to the hero's name that occurs earlier in the sentence

Gimli will definitely be played without Legolas on the board.  Being able to stand someone as you defend gives a world of options.  However, poor Legolas, being able to stand someone as you commit to the quest is not that helpful at all, specially considering you are kneeling a strong ranged attacker.   

## 61 [Nickpes on September 10, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228896-an-unlikely-friendship/?do=findComment&comment=2407997)

Maybe is wouldn't work, but would be pretty thematic

 

A deck with these two heroes and Loragorn. Attach Roheryn on Loragorn and you get fourshhere with a very strong hero combo. Then with StwB and SoG it gets even better.

 

And you have the three hunters

## 62 [NathanH on September 10, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228896-an-unlikely-friendship/?do=findComment&comment=2408110)

Legolas doesn't impress me very much without Gimli around, but I think he is not as bad as I first thought. There are a number of occasions where we're playing a pair of decks with a hero that we want to have ready after questing but has 2+ willpower, and don't have any good targets for Light of Valinor. In this case, Legolas effectively quests for 3 before the Light and then after the Light operates as a Glorfindel with Ranged. With 4 higher threat, not as good as Glorfindel I suppose, but if we're tired of him or want to use the ally, then Legolas is not rubbish.

 

As a quick example, we keep trying to get Eowyn to be boosted up by Herugrim and/or Golden Shield but all the pieces never seem to come together in time. Legolas removes the first piece (Snowmane) from the equation.

 

The discard is annoying, but Elven Light is a thing.

The only thing that really bothers me about the discard is that Legolas is Silvan.

Háma has a discard-based effect as well, and I don't hear any complaints about him not being Noldor. It makes the card pool more interesting, and decks more diverse, having effects with similar mechanics spread across different factions.

 

Regardless of the mechanics of their effects, I'm not sure how I feel about the new versions of Legolas and Gimli. I can see that they work well together, but I wonder about how often then will be used in other decks. Time will tell, but my concern is that we have another case of Elladan/Elrohir where they will only really see play together. I suppose they can slot into faction decks for their traits and sphere, but the cost (discard or resource) of their abilities seems a bit high if you aren't getting the secondary benefit.

I think I'd moslty if not only play these heroes together, and I still really like them. I don't think they're good enough in solo to warrant using just one of them in a deck, I agree with you there. But I think there could be very strong solo lineups with these two. Particularly because Spirit and Leadership in particular have fantastic options for action advantage, resources and now card draw thanks to Elven-light, which by the way works great with Legolas. I am looking forward to using these two guys.

## 67 [PsychoRocka on September 15, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228896-an-unlikely-friendship/?do=findComment&comment=2414893)

Hmmmmmm I don't know I think Gimli can still definitely be great without Legolas but Legolas is definitely not great without Gimli.

 

Gimli is built for defence with his ability and sentinel. You use his ability while defending which is perfect. Even if you only get the one use out of Gimli it is to defend which is what you want to use him for and you get to ready another hero who can also defend or attack or exhaust to do whatever. Legolas is not built to quest.... his 3 attack and ranged mean you want to be attacking with him. If you don;t have Gimli in play or some other way to ready Legolas then he just quests and readies another questing hero. Sure this hero he readies can be a great attacker instead but Legolas is still sort of wasted questing whereas Gimli can be used effectively on a regular basis.

Also yes the discard for Legolas's ability plays into many decks strengths and when paired with Elven Light and Noldor shenanigans it can be a benefit instead of a drawback however you do still need to discard a card every time  (and possibly every turn) to trigger the ability and this will cost you tons of spirit resources if you are recycling elven light every time or if you don't have extra card draw via someone like Galdor or Erestor this may end up slightly hurting you.

A similar argument can be made for Gimli's ability as you could obviously be spending his resources on other cards.

Leadership has TONS of resource ramp though and he even has the dwarven shield/the day is rising combo (which yes again is similar to elven light or silver harp for Legolas) to make his ability that much more readily available etc. 

I don't know.. I definietly think that Gimli has a slight edge over Legolas especially when talking about only including one of them in a hero line up. That being said I am running them together in my decks and they are a great duo! I am however using the tactics version of Legolas instead of this new spirit version.  With Steward/Shield and Armoured Destrier Gimli is a beast of a defender and with some nice weapon attachments and events like Hands Upon the Bow Legolas is a fantastic attacker that thanks to Gimli can occasionally make multiple attacks without a readying attachment. Anytime that Legolas is already ready I use Gimlis ability to either ready Elrond (so he can defend as well, usually with burning brand or so that he can use Vilya) or Tactigorn (so that he can either defend or make an attack and potentially trigger his ability). Pretty much every single use of Gimli's ability is extremely beneficial and allows me to have far more of a handle on combat or allows me to overcommit to the quest.

> Hmmmmmm I don't know I think Gimli can still definitely be great without Legolas but Legolas is definitely not great without Gimli.

still convinced of this as well.

 

the only time it works is with Light of Valinor with no other Silvan/Noldor heroes, but a worthwhile hero that can quest and either attack/defend that's worth discarding a card

 

but even then, Legolas is still questing for base 1, and as soon as any other Silvan/Noldor is in play, they're likely a much better target for LoV anyway, even with Lego's ability

 

that said, he's still a 3 ranged attack in spirit for 9 threat, so he can double up with Lanwyn for some decent secrecy ranged attack support Spirit deck or something.  both being scouts is pretty cool as well for that new spirit event
