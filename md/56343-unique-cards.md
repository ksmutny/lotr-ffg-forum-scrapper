let's say i have 3 copies of a unique card in my hand. i play one of them and it leaves play. am i able to play the other copies from my hand in future planning phases.

yes, of course =)

unique only prevents a card from being "in play" more than once. Neither the discard pile nor your hand are considered to be "in play"

I would also add that if a unique card is in play, a copy of that card cannot be played (the rules say you can't even attempt to play lol), even to replace the one in play.
