A lot of cards say that 'if your threat level is below ____" (20, for instance).

 

My question is, how can a threat level be that low?  Aren't you supposed to add up the numbers in the top left corner and that is your starting threat?  Seems like most combinations end up being between 30-35.  I don't know how a threat can be lower than 20.  Am I playing the game wrong?

There are a number of cards that can lower your initial threat.

 

In my mind, comes:

 

The Galadhrim's Greeting - http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/core/the-galadhrims-greeting-core [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/core/the-galadhrims-greeting-core]

Dwalin - http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/khazad-dum/dwalin-kd [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/khazad-dum/dwalin-kd]

 

 

EDIT: Forgot to add that some hero combinations can be lower then 20.

Also you don't nessesary play with 3 heroes if you go for the secrecy. One max two heroes usually is the custom for that,

You're not playing the game wrong; if your starting threat usually is between 30 and 35, you're just playing it differently to some others. Not all heroes have a threat of 10 or more, and not everyone uses 3 heroes. There are several heroes with 6,7 or 8 threat, which is a good starting point if you're going for Secrecy. Plus the cards CJMatos has already mentioned.

Let's not forget that you can reduce your threat level by 5 each time you put Core Gandalf into play.

I think it would be more effective about 25-30......this is a little useless.....to have small threat for secrecy some cards....although you can't play even with Aragorn for stacking...you have to get 2 heroes also so good as resolution...but still I think is so limited..... :unsure: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_unsure.png]

That's why secrecy never became popular. However, they added some new cards in the last cycle to give secrecy more meat. Also, the hobbit heroes with their ow starting threat offer a nice way to play secrecy.
