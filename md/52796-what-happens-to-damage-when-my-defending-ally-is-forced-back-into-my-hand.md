 Hey all, so several times I have pulled that darned Nazgul (artwork) card that's shadow effect forces an exhausted ally back into my hand. If I only have one exhausted ally out and he happens to be defending against an enemy, does the damage that is now "unblocked" get distributed onto one of my heroes? This is the way I have been playing it, and I have a feeling this is correct...I just hate this card if that is so. :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png] It has happened many a time and is very frustrating!!! Especially when your defender is Beorn. Any help confirming my suspicion? Thanks!

If the Assigned Defender is Removed before Damage is Applied, the Attack is considered Undefended.

 Indeed, I thought that, thank you.

This is a cruel, cruel game and yet we love it so much. I can't wait for the Osgiliath POD release even though I know it will slaughter me 19 times out of 20. FFG has clearly tapped into my inner masochist.

 Yeah, speaking of how cruel this game is...oddly enough it seems the larger the card pool gets the more often I lose. I haven't figured out why this is yet. Hahaha. I play mostly solo, and every combination I have tried of late has failed. I just don't want to play Eowyn, but mechanics wise she seems like an obvious choice. Grrrrrrrr.

Yeah my solo games are mostly disastrous.

That Shadow Effect caught me during stage 1 of Journey Down the Anduin. Brought in Gandalf to block the Hill Troll, Gandy was the only ally out there, poof, back to hand, 6dmg undefended, bye-bye Theodred. Didn't help that Aragorn had defended against the HT a turn before and was sitting on 4dmg. Suffice it to say the game ended in defeat.
