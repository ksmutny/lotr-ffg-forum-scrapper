# [Where can we get the rulesheet PDFs for later packs?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/219892-where-can-we-get-the-rulesheet-pdfs-for-later-packs/)

## 1 [tripecac on May 13, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/219892-where-can-we-get-the-rulesheet-pdfs-for-later-packs/?do=findComment&comment=2216333)

Although I have bought all the expansions and cycle packs which are available (except the nightmare decks), I find myself playing exclusively on OCTGN, so I don't open the packs anymore (in case I want to sell them later).  Therefore, in order to play each pack, I am reliant on the rulesheet PDFs that FFG posts on their support page:

 

https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-card-game/#/products-section [https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-card-game/#/products-section]

 

Unfortunately, FFG seems to have stopped uploading rulesheet PDFs for later packs; the last one they posted was for Across the Ettenmoors (on 14 September 2015). 

This means there's currently no way for me to read the rules (without opening the packs) for the following:

 

1) The Treachery of Rhudaur

2) The Battle of Carn Dum

3) The Dream Realm

4) The Grey Havens

5) Flight of the Stormcaller

 

Also, I wonder if there are rulesheets for the standalone scenarios:

 

6) Massing at Osgiliath

7) Battle of Lake-town

8) Stone of Erech

9) The Old Forest

10) Fog on the Barrow Downs

11) The Ruins of Belegost

12) Murder at the Prancing Pony

 

Although I am still making my way through the Khazad Dum cycle (which means I might reach The Treachery of Rhudaur in about 10 years!), I'm still a bit of a completionist when it comes to collecting stuff, so I would really love to have all the rulesheets (except for the nightmare decks) in PDF format (or GIF/JPG/PNG if no such PDF exists). 

 

Does anyone know where I can find the ones I listed above?

 

Thanks!

Man, I wish they would make 1 to 5 available, so I can put them on the quest companion.

Afaik, there is no pdf files for the others but you can found all rules on the quest companion.

I even sent a message to Caleb who forwarded me to the marketing services of FFG. That was 3 months ago at least. The service answered me with like a 2 months notice saying it'd be done soon...

Yeah, I don't know what the hold up is. I also sent a message to FFG several times months ago but no reply. I hope they get the rules inserts uploaded soon, but I have my doubts... >_>

Still no PDFs since September 2015.  Has anyone nudged FFG to post them, or heard anything about why they are not being posted?

A lot of things have NOT happened since September 2015 relating to FFG. I wonder what's going on there :/

Asmodee took control of FFG.

And by "control" you must mean "locked up all employees in a dungeon"? ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

As is customary when one company buys another one, of course.

Would anyone who has opened the physical cards be willing to scan the rule sheets which don't exist on the FFG site yet? I'd rather not open my packs if I can help it.

How do you plan on playing if you don't open the packs? Are you waiting to catch up to them?

## 11 [tripecac on July 16, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/219892-where-can-we-get-the-rulesheet-pdfs-for-later-packs/?do=findComment&comment=2313238)

I play exclusively on OCTGN (solo).  I'm currently still in Khazad Dum, but I will catch up, eventually (although I keep buying packs faster than I am playing through them!) 

 

Hopefully some day my kids will be old enough (and interested enough) to play with me, at which point I'll open the packs so that we can play on a table.  But until then I prefer to keep them sealed.

I know OCTGN takes some time to put up text and images of the cards, to help encourage people to buy the physical packs instead of using the program to simply play the game for free.  Could FFG be intentionally delaying posting the PDFs for the same reason?

 

I'd also say, if you own the physical packs, why not just open them up to read the rules?  I can understand not wanting to get the cards all out and potentially messed up, but considering the cards are sealed in their own wrapping, you could easily just read the rules/story...

Checking again, all the rulesheets are now up on the FFG site.

Because I am so far behind what I've bought (still in Khazad Dum), I know it will be months or years before I get caught up to many of the packs I've bought.  I'd prefer to keep them sealed until then.

 

For the PDFs, I like to have a complete collection.  Mostly just the collector's compulsion (which is the same urge that causes me to keep buying the packs!)

Awesome, I see that a bunch of PDFs were posted on 15 July.

 

I think this just leaves the Print on Demand scenarios:

 

6) Massing at Osgiliath

7) Battle of Lake-town

8) Stone of Erech

9) The Old Forest

10) Fog on the Barrow Downs

11) The Ruins of Belegost

12) Murder at the Prancing Pony

 

Do these not have their own rulesheets?

The ones I have don't seem to have rulesheets.  Instead, there's a card or two that sets up the scenario and discusses any special rules.

I wonder if there is a community resource for the POD rules cards? Anyone know if they've been compiled into a PDF?

Thats a very good point, the rulesheet and the cards are not sealed in together, so its just the selotape on the packaging to cut through with a knife (1 to 2 seconds) and then the rulesheet comes out without affecting the sealed wrapped card-block inside. Easy.

 

I love that FFG post up the PDFs as I like to keep rules on my kindle, I do suspect though that OCTGN will mean some people do play the game for free. Would they have bought cards otherwise?? Dunno, so its not clear if this actually affects sales or not.

I do know people who play and haven't bought anything, but overall I believe OCTGN is very good for the health of this game.

I'm guessing that the whole concept of collectible card games appeals to people who are willing to pay lots of money in order to collect things.  I wouldn't be surprised if many of the people on this forum also have large Tolkien collections, board game collections, blu-ray collections, CD collections, etc...

 

I still have many boxes of ICE's MECCG cards which I haven't opened yet!

9 months to upload 6 pdf files :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Could anyone who has played this quest just hop there and rate them? It's a good help to new players, thank you.

 If you can count getting the core box for a bunch of games with expansions, yes, I have a collection. But things I actually try to collect somewhat near completion? Just 2-3 FFG things :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

It feels more like collecting when I'm catching up, than when I'm following releases as they're out. My CoC LCG collection isn't complete, and that IS a real challenge nowadays. LotR gets reprinted so much I hardly feel it tickle the collector gland ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

 

It's basically more hoarding than collecting.

Just a note banania, I do not think FFG's rating system goes beyond 8.  The system on your site has 10 stars and shows FFG's rating scale on a 10 point system as well.

Yes I know, it was never stated what the scale was.

I chose 10 so that the players may "overrate" some quests. Assault on Osgiliath being 8 it'd be strange to cap the Battles of Lake town or Carn Dum to the same amount, and I did not want different scales between official and players ratings so as to avoid confusion.
