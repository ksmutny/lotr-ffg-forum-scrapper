So as the gf and I sit down to play the new Khazad-Dum expansion a new term keeps popping up that leaves us scratching our heads and wondering what it is? It certainly is not covered in the little 3 page explanation of the deluxe expansion and it isn't in the core set rulebook. What is a "Victory Display" ?

Maybe I am just ignorant and am missing something somewhere but I am unfamiliar with the term. I am guessing it is a place where your completed quests are shown or maybe a place where you splay out the victory points you have defeated so far?

I haven't got Kaz yet, I havn't read the new rules or anything... but I is it talking about the area out of play that you place cards with victory points?

It's the place where you put cards with victory points. When you defeat an enemy or explore a location that is worth victory points, it doesn't go to the encounter discard pile, it goes to the victory display. Think of it as a victory pile.
