What do you think the Fellowship event hero will be? They usually come in pairs.

I really don't know.  The art looks awesome, especially since the original is not my favorite art. It's weird though since lore glorfindel is not used very often.  If they keep that trend maybe they will pick Dori next

If any current hero needs new art it's him. The poor guy's got one heck of a migraine.

Elrond maybe?

I dunno, Lorefindel came so far out of left field that I don't really feel like it gives us any new information.

Maybe Gandalf? With Gandalf the White art? He and Glorf both sacrificed themselves fighting Balrogs.
