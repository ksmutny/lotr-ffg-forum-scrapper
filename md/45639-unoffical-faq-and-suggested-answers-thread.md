This thread contains the FAQ and suggested answers from the forum. As FFG provide official FAQ updates, this thread will be updated with official answers where the unofficial answer is different from the official one.

Updated following 1.2. FAQ

Split into Game Phases and Core and expansions. Kept the original numbering incase any other web sources refer to them.

General Rule Questions

61. When, exactly, can I play actions?

An important section of the rule book is page 30 of the Rule Book, concerning the flow chart.

page 30 of the Rule Book.

"Green – Any player can take actions generally, or

between the game steps stated in the rules."

This supercedes other sections of the rule book, which may only refer to allowing actions at the end of a rule step; providing that step is green, you may play actions during as well as at the end of that step.

Hero text

8. How does Thalin's ability interact with cards with only 1 hit point that have a when revealed action or surge key word? Is the text ignored because Thalin kills it as soon as it revealed or do the surge or when revealed action still occur

Thalin's ability resolves before any Keyword or when revealed effects.

12. How does Dunhere's ability work?

Dunhere can attack enemies in the staging area during the phase when other heroes attack (enemies engaged). Dunhere's +1 only works when he attacks an enemy in staging and only when attacking alone, the two are mutually inclusive. Dunhere's attack rating is compared against the enemies’ defence rating as normal. Dunhere' does not deal direct damage.

20. How does Legolas' ability or the Misty Mountain Goblin card work if there is an active location?

The active location works as a buffer when adding progress tokens, as described in the rulebook so progress tokens are added to the active location first, unless a card effect specifically states that it bypasses any active location. However, when a card refers to removing progress tokens from the quest (card), this is always from the main quest card, never from an active location.

21. Can you have cards in your player deck from a sphere that doesn't match the sphere of one of your heroes?

There is nothing in the rules that directly disallows this, although the player will be required to play specific card combos to be able to play those cards

36. Can a character such as Legolas or dunhere, who can attack enemies with which they are not engaged attack those enemies more than once per round using cards such as Unexpected Courage?

Players can only declare one attack against an enemy whether they are engaged with them, or whether the attack is possible through keywords such as ranged. However, if through a card effect, a second attack is somehow possible with that character, then that attack can occur against an enemy already attacked this round.

45. Does Frodo's Response allow him to survive against the Muck Adder's forced effect?

Yes. As Frodo cancels the damage and turns it into threat, the Muck Adders forced effect does not occur.

56. When using Eleanor's ability, does the when revealed effect of the replacement card trigger?

Yes, the replacement card is still revealed so any card text triggers as normal.

60. If Eleanor cancels a card's when revealed effect and the card also has keywords such as Doomed or Surge, what happens?

Eleanor's ability only cancels the when revealed effect, any other keywords on the card trigger as normal. If a Surge or Doomed effect would occur as part of the when revealed condition and that condition is cancelled, Surge and/or Doomed does not occur.

General Card text - Core

2. How does the Forced action on the Dol Guldur beastmaster work? When is the extra shadow card applied, and as it uses the words "After xxx attacks" (in the same way that Chieftain Ufthak has) how does the Chieftain's forced action work in comparison?

The DGB card is interpreted as having the word When rather than After. This means that DGB is dealt two shadow cards. Chieftain Ufthak's ability resovles after step 4 of combat so has an initial combat strength of 3 in the first round in which he engages a player, 5 in the second round and so on.

6. Can you use Protector or Lorien to discard multiple cards to obtain > 1 defence or willpower bonus per round/phase?

Yes.

10. When encounter cards come into play outside of the quest phase what parts of the card are still relevant? The description of surge/doomed states this only applies during staging step of quest phase, so is that keyword ignored? How about cards such as Pursued by Shadow, as outside of the quest phase NO hero is considered committed to a quest (although they may still be exhausted from previously committing to the quest), so is the when revealed affect applied to all heroes or is it ignored completely?

Surge, Doomed and Guarded resolve any time a card with those keywords is placed in the staging area, even during set-up. Other card effects resolve as intended, so in the case of pursued by shadow the effect applies as if no characters were committed to the quest.

11. Are attachments considered their own card for purposes of exhausting (such as "Steward of Gondor") or does the hero they are attached to need to be exhausted to use them? The card says "Exhaust Steward of Gondor" which makes me believe it is just the card, and you can use it every turn to get a bonus 2 resources.

Yes only the card is exhausted, not the hero.

24. How does Beorn's ability work with sneak attack?

Both cards have exactly the same trigger condition and therefore you can choose in which order to apply the text. This means you can return him to your hand via sneak attack ruling rather than to the deck by Beorn's own ruling, if you prefer. Whenever there is a timing conflict such as this, the first player always decides which card trigger is resolved first.

28. Does the horn of Gondor ability work for all participating players´ characters or only the player of the card?

The horn's ability applies to all participating players characters

33. Do the Orc Guards generated by the effects of the Tower Gate location and Out of the Dungeons quest have the Orc Trait?

No, facedown cards do not have traits unless obtained by a specific card effect.

35. Because of the Dungeon Jailer I need to place an Objective back into the deck,

1) What happens to the Encounter card attached / guarding it?

2) What do I do with it once the Objective card is later revealed from the deck?

1. . The objective goes into the deck, the card gurading it remains in the staging area.

2. Follow the instructions on P. 24 of the rule book. The objective card is placed in the staging area and the next Encounter card is turned to guard the objective due to the guarded keyword.

37. (Especially for the guys at the excellent CardBoardoftheRings!) The Banks of the Anduin Forced effect says to return the card to the top of the encounter pile when TBotA leaves play. Does this include when the card is turned as a shadow card?

Only a cards shadow effect (text below the Shadow Icon on the card) is resolved when the card is revealed as a shadow card, all other text is ignored. Therefore TBotA will go to the discard pile rather than the top of the encounter deck after being revealed as a shadow card.

38. The text on the Nazgul card states that "after the shadow effect resolves" (not shadow card), the engaged player removes 1 character. What does this mean exactly if the encounter card dealt as a shadow card has no shadow effect?

Since the card states shadow effect, if the nazgul receives a shadow card with no effect, his forced ability does not activate (no effect to resolve).

39. In regard to the final quest in the core set,

A. What does it mean when it says players as a group can play only one ally per round?

Only one ally can be played, TOTAL, per turn by all players combined.

B. When you hold the torch, do you have to raise your threat by 2 or 1+2 (total 3) at the end of the round?

The torch says to increase by 2, and it is an entirely separate effect from the normal increase at turn end, so that would be 3 total.

C. As guarded means you stick one card from the encounter deck to the objective, and until it is defeated you can't claim it. Can you claim it in every phase or subphase as an action? Can you engage the guarding enemy as normal?

The attached cards are treated as they normally would be. Enemies engage, attack and can be attacked, locations can be traveled to and explored, treachery cards affect play as usual. When an objective is free from cards it can be claimed as stated on the card itself (presently, all available objectives are claimed as actions).

D. Do you deal shadow cards to the orcs of the last stage (1/1 with one HP)?

The orc guards are "treated as enemies" and so get shadow cards like any other enemy.

43. With Tower Gate, the card you take from the top of you deck to be used as an Orc, what happens to the "orc" after you defeat it?

Defeated enemies get put in the discard pile. Since you own the card it gets placed in your discard pile.

55. Can Gandalf be used with Stand and Fight?

No, Stand and Fight can be used to bring back an ally belonging to any Sphere, but as a Neutral card, Gandalf doesn't belong to any of the 4 spheres.

57. During the set up of Dol Guldur, do the when revealed effects of cards trigger when used to guard the objectives?

No, those cards are not revealed, they are only attached. Therefore the When Revealed effects of cards used to guard objectives during the set-up of that scenario are not triggered.

General card text - Shadows Of Mirkwood

50. Do cards that grant an extra resource icon grant extra resource tokens of that icon type, or make the existing tokens of that hero more flexible?

Cards that add a resource icon such as Song of Wisdom or Song of Kings, only grant an extra icon meaning any resource tokens the hero has now or in the future are more flexible and usable for cards of any icon the Hero has. The do not grant the hero any additional resources unless it is specifically stated in the card effects.

52. How does Radagast's card text work?

1) Radagast's resources can be used to pay for the total cost of any creature ally regardless of sphere, or can be used in combination with the resources of a hero or heroes that match the sphere of the ally, to pay for the total cost

2) Radagast will not override the resource match necessary for playing Creature cards with a cost of 0, as his ability would not be used

Planning Phase - Core

26. Can you place an attachment on another players hero? Does the hero need to be of the same sphere as the attachment?

Any character that meets the requirements of the attachment can receive the attachment. Unless specifically stated as a requirement on the card, you can play attachments on any hero (or character if the attachment allows), including another players' and/or one that is a different sphere to which the attachment belongs

31. Can I attach two of the same attachment to the same character? Two Citadel plates or Two Protector of Loriens?

The only restriction currently with attachments is that a single character is restricted to a limit of 2 attachments with the keyword "Restricted". This allows you two place 2 citadel plates etc onto the same character (if it helps picture this as being a single suit of better quality armour, rather than 2 separate suits). Note however, that each attachment is treated separately, so if there is a cost to activate the card (as is the case with Protector of Lorien), that cost must be paid for each card individually.

42. If I play Steward of Gondor, can I immediately exhaust it to gain additional resource and then spend those resource immediately to play additional Allies or attachments etc?

The entire planning phase is coloured green in the process flow, which means actions can be taken freely during that stage, so yes SoG can be played and then immediately exhausted for additional resource to spend.

62. When playing attachments that have requirements (such as being played on a character of a certain sphere), when are those requirements checked?

The requirements are only checked when attaching, once the attachment has been played and attached, it is not neccessary to discard the attachment if the requirements are no longer met on subsequent rounds.

Planning Phase - Shadows of Mirkwood

47. If Song of Wisdom is played then Burning Brand is played an the same hero, but that hero later loses the Song of Wisdom attachment do they also lose Burning Brand?

There is nothing in the rules to support the idea that the Burning Brand is lost. The requirement for Burning Brand to be attached to a lore hero is only at the time of attachment.

Quest Phase - Core

1. If Ungoliant's Spawn has already been defeated, or is already in play when Don't Leave the Path Enter play, what happens?

We actually have an official answer to this, but i have just added it for completeness, the answer is that if it is already defeated it must be defeated again, but if it is already in play, this does count as it being found and therefore will only need to be defeated once (not twice).

3. If a location in the staging area has enough progress tokens on it (from the Northern tracker for instance), is it immediately removed from play, or does it still have to be made an active location, before it is removed?

It is removed from play as soon as it has enough tokens on it.

5. When exhausting a character to a quest, do i exhaust a character and then use the Response relating to that character then exhaust the next and so on, or do i exhaust all simultaneously and then apply their responses in any order i want? (Important when using the Aragorn/Theodred combo). How about Old Forest Road and Strength of Will? Can the players travel to OFR, then use SoW, then use the response on OFR to ready the character that was just exhausted to meet SoW, or do the responses on a location take precendence and have to be taken first?

Responses can be used in any order, which solves the OFR vs SoW problem, and a player's heroes committing to the quest is done simultaneously and separately to completing Responses, so all characters can be exhausted simultaneously, allowing Theodred's power to be used on Aragorn and then for Aragorn to ready using the resource he just obtained from Theodred. Note though, that one player commits characters to the quest and plays responses then the next player and so on, this means if the first player had the hero Theodred and commits him to the quest, Theodred's response could not be used to give a resource to a hero of another player as another players heros will not yet have committed to the quest.

13. One of the Spirit ally cards (Northern Tracker) allows him to place a single progress token on every location in the staging area when he commits to a quest. Is this done *before* new cards are drawn and you compare Willpower vs. Corruption?

Yes. Northern Tracker's ability is a response so this is done in response to the game occurrence (commiting to a quest) and before any other game occurences occur (such as pulling a new staging card).

14. When dealing cards into the staging area during the questing phase, do i deal 1 card per player, or 1 card per player that has a hero questing this round?

1 card per player.

30. Henamarth Riversong and Glorfindel are questing. In the adventure phase I draw "The Necromancer's Reach" and Riversong dies cause of that. Does his Willpower count towards the questing willpower?

The Willpower vs. threat calculation is completed during step 3 of the Questing phase, only characters still alive and considered questing during that stage have their willpower counted. As Riversong was destroyed during an earlier step, when the new encounter card is added to the staging area, his willpower is NOT counted during stage 3 of the questing phase.

32. If there is an active location (with or without tokens) and despair has just revealed, what do you do?

The Despair card specifically states removing tokens from the quest card and therefore, as clarified in question 20, the tokens are removed from the main quest card, not the active location.

34. If the first card attached to an objective is a location with "surge" keyword, I reveal another card from the encounter deck but where do I place this new "surged" card? Do I attach it to the objective, together with the first encounter card - and both of them are protecting the same objective card - or do I place it separately in the staging area?

Resolve any keywords as they occur. So you would attach the encounter with Surge to the Objective, then draw an additional card. Just the first card counts as guarding the Objective.

If you draw another Surge, you resolve it as though you would any other Surge - by drawing an additional card.

44. If I do not quest with any characters do I skip the quest phase? (An old one but I've seen it asked enough times by new players so I've added it to the FAQ)

Even if you do not commit anyone to the quest, the quest phase still occurs, adding additional cards to the staging area and comparing willpower (of 0) against current threat. It is generally a good idea to quest with at least some characters each turn.

48. If Lorien Guide is played and there is no active location, can the progress token be placed on the current quest?

No, Lorien Guide specifically states active location and therefore if there is no active location no progress token is placed at all

51. When can cards be played during questing? The rulebook P.14 states that cards can be played at the end of each step, where the game flows at the back of the rule book states card canbe played generally during green steps

The games flows are accurate. Cards can be played at any point during a green step in the game flows. The statement on P.14 is referring specifically to red steps when actions can only be played at the end of the step

58. Is there an upper limit for the number of progress tokens that can be placed on a quest card, for when completing that card has specific requirements such as Kill a specific enemy, in addition to a number of progress tokens?

There is no upper limit, and excess progress tokens can therefore be used as a buffer against cards such as Misty mountain Goblins, until such time as the quest card can be completed.

Quest Phase - The Hunt for Gollum

59. Does the forced condition on the 1st quest card in the Hunt for Gollum still trigger on the round when that phase of the quest is completed.

The Forced condition is triggered upon questing successfully. The definition of questing successfully is having total willpower > staging area threat, and is a seperate step to applying progress tokens to active locations/quest cards. Therefore as soon as the players have quested successfully the forced condition should trigger, then total progress tokens are calculated and placed on the quest card, then resolving that phase of the quest if enough are placed.

Quest Phase - Conflict at the Carrock

54. How do you defeat the second quest card as there are no specific victory conditions?

The entire quest is completed as soon as all Trolls in play are defeated and the 2nd quest card has at least 1 progress token on it

Travel Phase - Core

23. The Brown Lands card says that after player travel place 1 travel token on it, this would mean that the location would cancel itself?

This is correct. The main issue with the Brown Lands is it excessive threat (5), which must be dealt with prior to travelling to it and the need to be able to make it an active location before you can remove it (unless you have a way of adding progress tokens to cards in the staging area).

Combat Phase - Core

4. If you defend with multiple characters and still take damage, how is that damage applied amongst the defenders?

The damage is applied to a single defender.

7. If an enemy cannot attack (caught in a forest snare for instance) do they still get dealt a shadow card?

By the rules, an attack consists of 4 steps (P. 18 rulebook). Dealing a shadow card is not one of those 4 steps but revealing a shadow card is. Therefore by the rules a shadow card is dealt but not revealed and is then discarded at the end of the phase. So the dealing of the card is currently a moot point and only relevant to burn through the encounter deck.

9. If a shadow effect or some other process causes a hero to lose an attachment, does this include negative attachments such as the Caught in a web treachery card? In effect can the shadow effect benefit the hero in this case?

No. The player is not considered to be in control of such cards as they are never played by a player.

15. Do enemies count as characters for effects such as the horn of Gondor?

No. They are not characters, only heroes and allies are classed as characters.

16. When a hero can attack twice (such as Aragorn's ability) can both attacks be against the same creature?

Yes, but only by using certain card effects. Each player can only attack each enemy once with which he is engaged, when the player is the active attacker. However, if a hero is somehow able to ready after being exhausted from attacking this enemy, and is able to attack through a card effect such as quickstrike then he can then be used to attack the same enemy again.

17. What happens when a "Hill Troll" attack goes undefended?

1.) Hill troll's damage all goes directly to threat. OR...

2.) Damage goes unto a hero and spills over into threat.

The answer is 2. Damage must be applied as in the rules (onto a single hero for an undefended attack), any excess damage is then applied as defined on the Hill Troll card.

18. When is the feint card played? Can it be played in conjunction with the Gondorian spearman as a defender?

By the rules, an attack consists of 4 steps (P. 18 rulebook). Therefore the feint card must be played before any of these steps occur and once played prevent any of these 4 steps from occurring. As one of these 4 steps is declare defender, Feint and Gondorian defender cannot be played against the same attack in the same round.

19. Do the threat of engaged enemies still count during the questing phase? Do engaged enemies disengage at the end of each round?

Only the threat of enemies in the staging area count when determining threat during the questing phase. When enemies move from the staging area to engaged with a player, the enemies stay engaged with that player over subsequent rounds unless a specific effect allows them to move back to the staging area. While engaged their threat is no longer counted, in the same way that the threat of an active location is no longer counted.

22. What does "eligible enemy target" mean on the Quick Strike card?

Eligible means "any enemy you can normally attack in the combat phase" quick strike allows you to attack that enemy in any phase. That would mean Dunhere can attack Enemies in Staging and Ranged characters could attack Enemies engaged with other players. Other characters would have to attack Enemies engaged with you. (Thanks to Apophenia for this concisely worded answer)

25. Do treachery cards effects resolve when they are drawn as shadow cards?

Only cards with a stated shadow effect resolve when drawn as a shadow cards. All other effects on the cards, regardless of card type are ignored.

27. During engagement checks, if there are two enemies with the same threat in the staging area which one engages the player?

Each player makes an engagement check in turn. If there are two enemies with the same threat rating equal to or less than the players threat then the player must choose to engage one of the enemies, which one is the player's choice (through discussion with the other players, if they so wish). Play then proceeds to the next player to make their engagement check and so on.

29. If when defending an attack, the revealed shadow effect deals damage and destroys the defender, is the attack now considered undefended?

P. 18, bottom left: "If a defending character leaves play or is removed from combat before damage is assigned, the attack is considered undefended." In this statement, damage assigned refers to damage generated by comparing attack strength vs. the defenders defence strength. As the defender was destroyed prior to this being calculated (via a direct damage shadow effect) the attack is considered undefended.

40. What happens if your hero takes a bunch of damage while wearing citadel plate, but then has to discard said armor. Would all the damage taken now apply to his unmodiffied Health levels?

According to the rulebook, hit points are "the number of damage required to destroy [a] card." Therefore, as soon as a card has a number of damage tokens on it equivalent to its hit points, it is immediately destroyed. So if Gimli had five damage tokens on him, but was still alive thanks to Citadel Plate, the moment that attachment was discarded, Gimli's hit points would of course be returned to their normal value (5), and he would be destroyed.

To make matters worse, if he had to discard the Citadel Plate due to, lets say, Forest Spider's shadow effect, the player wouldn't even have any opportunity to heal or remove any of those damage tokens before the attachment is discarded since shadow effects are resolved immediately.

41. If Wolf Rider is turned as a shadow card and therefore attacks the player with it's own shadow card, when does Wolf Rider return to the encounter deck?

The card states that Wolf Rider returns after combat - this means at the end of the entire combat phase, in which case the player can attampt to attack Wolf Rider back if he has an available Hero or ally to do so.

46. Regarding the Despair card's shadow effect that nullifies the defending character's defense, is that just the character card's printed defense? Is it possible to boost the defense with cards like Blade Mastery and Protector of Lorien?

No, Despair states the character does not count their defence. That is the total defence regardless of how it is obtained.

49. Can Stand Together be played to allow Sentinels to group together to defend against an undefended attack?

No. Stand Together specifically allows a player to use multiple defenders to defend against an attack on that player, whereas Sentinels are used to defend against undefended attacks against other players. The wording on the cards makes them mutually exclusive.

55. How is it possible to attack the same enemy more than once in a single round?

Without a specific card effect that can break the golden rule, such a QuickStrike, then while each player is the active player, they may declare only a single attack against each enemy that they may legally attack. Any number of the active players character's that are ready and able to attack that enemy can participate in that attack, In addition, any characters controlled by other players may participate in that attack providing they are ready and able to attack that enemy even if those characters have participated in an attack against that enemy already in the round.

Combat Phase - Shadows of Mirkwood

53. If the shadow card dealt to the Wargs is cancelled by burning brand, does the Wargs retreat to the staging area?

No. The Wargs card states that it returns to the staging area if it is dealt a shadow card with no effect. Although the effect is cancelled, the card itself still has an effect, it just doesn't affect anything.

New additions:

Q: When (at which substep of an attack) does "Striking Tentacle" 's forced effect trigger? Before step 2, and just preventing the declaration of a defender, or somewhen after step 2 (so I will want to declare a defender and when the attack is undefended, I also have exhausted that character in vain)

A: The forced effect triggers when it attacks, so that would happen in Step 1, before declaring defenders.

Q: When a hero is shuffled into my deck because of "Lost and Alone" and shall be attached to a Nameless enemy, is it possible? If yes, is his cost considered 0 or do I have to use his threat cost?

A: Yes it is possible. Heroes do not have cost, so it would count as 0.

Any other unanswered or heavily debated questions I have missed?

Thanks for compiling this list.  I would add something about whether monsters that can not attack still receive Shadow cards.

As there now quite a few questions and speculation around a few of the cards I thought I'd start a thread to start to collate them so that FFG at least can go to one place. As new questions arise that can't be fully answered by the current rule set or forumites, we can add them to this thread and bump it every so often.

If you've got a question please ask it in its own thread first and only add it here if us forumites can't come up with a concensus, otherwise this thread will get bogged down with questions and responses, which isn't the intention.

From looking at other threads the questions that I don't think have full answers yet are...

1. If Ungoliant's Spawn has already been defeated, or is already in play when Don't Leave the Path Enter play, what happens?

We actually have an official answer to this, but i have just added it for completeness, the answer is that if it is already defeated it must be defeated again, but if it is already in play, this does count as it being found and therefore will only need to be defeated once (not twice).

2. How does the Forced action on the Dol Guldur beastmaster work? When is the extra shadow card applied, and as it uses the words "After xxx attacks" (in the same way that Chieftain Ufthak has) how does the Chieftain's forced action work in comparison?

3. If a location in the staging area has enough progress tokens on it (from the Nothern tracker for instance), is it immediately removed from play, or does it still have to be made an active location, before it is removed?

4. If you defend with multiple characters and still take damage, how is that damage applied amongst the defenders?

5. When exhausting a character to a quest, do i exhaust a character and then use the action relating to that character then exhaust the next and so on, or do i exhaust all simultanously and then apply their actions in any order i want? (Important when using the Aragorn/Theodred combo)

6. Can you use Protector or Lorien to discard multiple cards to obtain > 1 defence or willpower bonus per round/phase?

7. If an enemy cannot attack (caught in a forest snare for instance) do they still get dealt a shadow card?

 

Any other unaswered or heavily debated questions I have missed?



 

1) You answered this one correct.

2) DGB gets dealt 2 shadow cards and both are resolved as if his ability read "when DGB attacks..." Chieftan Ufthak gets his +2 attack on the next round's attack phase as if his were actually "after the attack resolves..."

3) Locations in staging area that have full progress tokens are explored and discarded.

4)You cannot defend with multiple characters. One character per defend. Extra damage is soaked up and nothing happens. Undefended attacks all damage is applied to a single hero(if you didn't know).

5) All characters exhaust at the same time. Your choice on actions and their order. Yes, TheodredAragorn is just that **** good. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

6) Yes, multiple times per round.

7) Yes they get dealt a shadow card but that attack is never resolved so the shadow card gets discarded without resolving it.

## 6 [Widowmaker93 on April 23, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45639-unoffical-faq-and-suggested-answers-thread/?do=findComment&comment=457912)

If someone plays Stand Together however you can divide the damage however you want among the characters. Basically allowing two 2HP allies to block a 2str attacker and both live. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

## 7 [thearrow on April 23, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45639-unoffical-faq-and-suggested-answers-thread/?do=findComment&comment=457925)

3. On page 15 of the rulebook it states that if a location EVER has as many progress tokens as it has quest points then that location is considered EXPLORED and is discarded from play. I t doesnt say that it has to be an active location for it to be discarded.

4. On page 18 of the rulebook - resolving enemy attacks.In the determine combat damage explanation it states that the damage must immediately be dealt to the defending character. Usually this would be on one character but where there are two defenders I think the rule would be "damage dealt to defending characters" (so you could share the damage between them if you want to).

Thanks for the various responses and although personally i think you are right in the majority if not all of the answers, I wanted to avoid having this thread bog down with forum assumed answers to the questions and just keep it an update of questions that still needed an official response, if possible (an impossible dream perhaps, but I can but try!)

All of the questions here have their own thread or threads on the forum, so check those out if you want to see why there is still some indecision on what the offical answer should be.; I won't repeat the discussions here.

@Shadow1VT,

I haven't seen that question asked elsewhere, what is the question exactly?

The question stems from the interaction of Thalin "While Thalin is committed to a quest, deal 1 damage to each enemy as it is revealed by the encounter deck" and Eastern Crows "Surge" power.

The argument, as I understand it is that Thalin's ability is an ongoing effect that happens as soon as cards are revealed.  The surge power states that you "resolve the surge keyword immediately after resolving any when revealed effects on the card."  So, Thalin's power activates when the Crows are revealed, killing them and sending them back into the encounter deck, without ever giving surge a chance to resolve.

 I remembered one.

Are you considered to have control of Encounter deck cards attached to your characters (like Caught in the Web). This matters if you get one of the shadow effects that force you to discard an attachment.

 

Personally I think you do have control but it would be nice to have an official response.

Thanks. Yes,  I don't expect FFG to reply directly to this thread but they do monitor the forums so I'm hopefully just giving them an easy method (along with everyone else on the forum) to find all the questions that can't be categorically answered by info in the rule book, so that when we do get a FAQ, these questions can be included in it.

All the questions on it have already started some debate to a greater or lesser degree

this question has been answered for locations, but what about for quests? what happenes when one gets the requisit number of exploration tokens outside of the quest phase, say from legolas. do you advance immediately or have to wait for the next quest phase? and if you have to wait do you have so successfully quest?

you advance in quest stages as soon as you hit the required progress. Nowhere in the rules does it state that you have to be in the Quest phase to advance a quest.

My question concerns questing and revealing encounter cards:

In the rulebook it states that each player has the option to go on a quest. Then after all players decide the encounter deck reveals one card for each player. 

By the wording of the rulebook, I would apply that the encounter deck reveals X cards each turn where X = the number of the players in the game. So even if zero or only 1 player quest (in a 2 player game for instance) the encounter deck is still going to reveal 2 cards, since there are two players in the game.

I want to verify that this is indeed the correct and intended way to play. Thanks.

No need for that to be in the FAQ - its clear in the rules.  1 card per player.  Not 1 card per player who chose to quest.

After playing the Anduin scenario, I have questions about Encounter cards that are revealed outside of the Quest phase.

Does the Surge keyword apply?  (I believe not, since the rulebook's explanation of Surge explicitly refers to cards revealed during the quest phase)

What about cards like Pursued By Shadow, which refer to characters that are or are not committed to a quest?  Outside of the quest phase, or during setup, you won't have any characters committed to the quest.

I agree with this. P22 explains how questing and progress works and this is outside of the actual rulebook section on phase 3: quest, so quests advance at any phase as soon as they have sufficient progress tokens.

I reckon pursued by shadow is applied to all Heroes, because as you say, no one is commited to a quest outside of the quest phase.

I also think you have called it right with Surge, but I've added both to the FAQ for clarification

Old Forest Road (Location)
Response: After you travel to Old Forest Road, the first player may choose and ready 1 character he controls.

Strength of Will (Event)
Response: After you travel to a location, exhaust a [spirit] character to place 2 progress tokens on that location.

That would seem to work similarly to the interaction between Aragorn and Theodred as discussed in the FAQ thread. You get your two progress tokens for free if you want.

Wait, that doesnt make sense. You cant pay for the effect of Strength of Will with the effect of Old Forest Road. Effects can only be payed with cards you control (this is the case in Agot anyway, maybe its different in Lotr) and even if they Can be payed with cards you dont control (which seems very unlikely) youre not exhausting the character for the purposes of Strength of Will. Infact, this raises the question of how action windows Work in this game. Whats the timing on playing Strength of Will? both effects active "after you travel" but does this game have a window for simultanious card effect resolution or does there have to be an order to effect resolution. Ie. can you resovle SoW and OFR at the same time? Or does one of them have to take precidence?

Oi Weh this hurts my head o.O

Don't think he can attack the same creature twice, or be counted twice in a single attac k against a creature. He can however attack two different creatures,

When resolving effects that read...."After you commit to the quest..." or "After you travel to this location..." each player has the option to resolve effects in the order he/she chooses. So if you want to ready your character then use him to pay for your second effect that is perfectly legal.

Sounds good enough to me. How would Thalin's effect interact with Enemies with When Revealed abilities, though? If he kills the Enemy (rare chance), does its effect still happen? It was revealed, after all.

Players always assume control of attachments that have been played on their characters. (pg.25 under Control and Ownership) Caught in a web is a Treachery card that counts as a Condition Attachment when attached to a character.

Cards from the encounter deck are not played, they are staged, placed, revealed and resolved.

The distinction is made when they highlight the word "play" in the phase 2 Planning rules and when they highlight the word staging in the staging rules

Their emphasis not mine:

Phase 2: Planning
This is the only phase in which a player can play ally
and attachment cards from his hand. The first player
plays any and all ally and attachment cards he wishes to
play first.

 

Step 2: Staging
After each player has had the opportunity to commit
characters to the quest, the encounter deck reveals
one card per player. This is known in the game as
staging. These encounter cards are revealed one at a
time, with any “when revealed” effects being resolved
before the next card is revealed. Enemy and location
cards revealed in this manner are placed in the staging
area, treachery cards are resolved and (unless otherwise
indicated by the card text) placed in the discard pile.

Can't argue with that you are completely right on about it Darksbane. Played and Staged are two distinct things. Played is only referred to under Control and Ownership section. Then my previous attempt to clarify a ruling under Caught in a Web is null and void. Unless of course something comes up in an official FAQ.

Yes Thalin will deal lethal damage to that character but you are correct in assuming that their ability will still go off since it was technically "revealed." The only ability that won't come into play if Thalin kills that enemy is a Surge keyword.

In Reply to Darksbane...

The emphasis on the word "STAGING" is as reference to the phase step.  Just as on pg. 16 they did the same thing with "ENGAGEMENT CHECK" not because of its particularly important wording just to emphasis the phase step.  Important words sure, but it does not negate the inferred -  your character - your attachment - in the control and ownership section.  Your statement would mean that if they ever talk about a "played" card - it would require that wording in card text.  Therefore, if card would say "place attachment on target character" - you would argue that it had been "placed" not "played" or as many other effects "resolved" and not "played".  This seems counter-intuituve.  I would agree, clarification would be nice, and, as with all new card games, common woding must be consistently used to differentiate actual effect from intended effect.

For me - Your charcter - Your attachment.

 Hate to belabor this point but there is also this card to pondor - Driven by Shadow - Shadow: Choose and discard 1 attachment from the defending character. (If this attack is undefended, discard all attachments you control.)

From Darksbane's ruling - defending character could get rid of "Caught In A Web" - (no control required, as per text) but if it were undefended - all attachments would go except "Caught in a Web". 

Once again, bad wording, but counter-intuitive.  I'm sure a FAQ will be coming from FFG shortly.

The ruling is consistant with FFG's other LCGs and how they handle "play" as opposed to other ways cards come into play. For example see AGOT's FAQ entry on Play and Put Into Play, and even though you think it counter intuitive it is pretty much like your example above.

(4.4) "Play" and "Put into Play"
Character, Location, and Attachment cards are
“played” from the hand during the marshalling
phase, by taking a player action and paying
their gold cost.
Event cards are “played” by placing the card
on the table, paying the specified cost, and
triggering the effect.
"Put into play" effects are not considered to be
"played." Similarly, when a card is "put into
play," it does not trigger any "when played"
effects, and vice versa. Both, however, would

trigger effects that occur when a card "comes
into play” or “enters play.”
"Put into Play" is a game mechanic that
bypasses all costs (including all gold penalties)
and play restrictions.

Also notice in the rulebook the difference in the discriptions of Treachery cards and Event cards

Treachery Cards
Treachery cards represent traps, curses, maneuvers,
pitfalls, and other surprises the players might confront
during a scenario. When a treachery card is revealed
from the encounter deck, its text effects are resolved
immediately, and it is then placed in the encounter
discard pile.

Event Cards

Event cards represent maneuvers, actions, tactics,
spells, and other instantaneous effects at a player’s
disposal. An event card is played from a player’s hand,
its text effects are resolved, and the card is then placed
in its owner’s discard pile.

You can look at the other card types too, no where but in the hero card section is anything described as played, and all hero cards which are played from hand are described with either play or played. The rulebook makes a clear enough distinction between using the word play or played only in refrence to Hero deck cards that as far as game terms are concerned that only hero deck cards are ever played and thus only hero attachments come under your control.

As for your other issues, given Driven by the Shadow's text yes you could discard Caught in a Web with it. Also see this thread on Board Game Geek [http://boardgamegeek.com/article/6654218#6654218], Zambo IIRC playtested the game and confirms. I do agree a FAQ entry will be nice but I fully expect it to not consider encounter cards to be under the control of the player whose character it is on.

I defer to your ruling.  The use of a credited playtester to support your statement is pretty freakin strong.  FAQ should clear up some of these issues but I believe you are correct and the control issue will remain as you said.  Still, I think it is foolish for "Driven by the Shadows" to clear the attachment when another card won't, and when it won't when undefended.  But, like I said before, new card games always run into wording issues.

 Few questions of my own :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] 

 

1. Are attachments considered their own card for purposes of exhausting (such as "Steward of Gondor") or does the hero they are attached to need to be exhausted to use them? The card says "Exhaust Steward of Gondor" which makes me believe it is just the card, and you can use it every turn to get a bonus 2 resources. Seems pretty powerful, but sounds like that is how it should be.

 

2. When does... darn, I forgot his name, the guy that can attack enemies in the staging area. When does his ability trigger? We assumed it was during the normal Attack part of Combat, but his card really didn't specify much.

 

3. One of the Spirit ally cards allows him to place a single progress token on every location in the staging area when he commits to a quest. This is done *before* new cards are drawn and you compare Willpower vs. Corruption, correct?

Thanks for the various responses and although personally i think you are right in the majority if not all of the answers, I wanted to avoid having this thread bog down with forum assumed answers to the questions and just keep it an update of questions that still needed an official response, if possible (an impossible dream perhaps, but I can but try!)

All of the questions here have their own thread or threads on the forum, so check those out if you want to see why there is still some indecision on what the offical answer should be.; I won't repeat the discussions here.

 

Just a suggestion, but if this thread is going to be useful to players (and not just FFG employees), it needs to put up at least consensus answers to these questions.  I've noticed that some of the questions in this thread are ignored as "clearly" outlined in the rulebook, while others that seem pretty clear to me are still included in the FAQ.  Maybe put up the "working" answer to these questions if there is one, then make a note or a link by those that are officially answered.  It may be a long time before we have an official FAQ, and it would be really helpful for new players to be able to come to this forum and get an answer as to how most people are interpreting a rule.  Maybe some of the answers turn out to be wrong and you have to amend the FAQ, but I bet a lot of these questions can be answered with 90% certainty.

I defer to your ruling.  The use of a credited playtester to support your statement is pretty freakin strong.  FAQ should clear up some of these issues but I believe you are correct and the control issue will remain as you said.  Still, I think it is foolish for "Driven by the Shadows" to clear the attachment when another card won't, and when it won't when undefended.  But, like I said before, new card games always run into wording issues.



The text is poorly worded though in that case, right. No one thinks the Driven by Shadow is actually supposed to work like this?

Its the same as Dol Guldor Beastmaster and Chieftain Ufthak, they both have the phrase "after xxx attacks, but general concensus is that the two actions occur at different times in the combat phase. General concensus is that Dol Guldor beastmaster is poorly worded....

I'm just clarifying because following Entropy42's suggestion, I'm going to start to put best guess answers against the questions and I didn't want to put that Driven by shadow can remove caught in the web under certain circumstances because that sounds daft....

If you put up a ruling on a question, and no one comes along and says "thats wrong and here is the passage in the rules that supports my argument" then you've probably got a decent answer.  Sometimes the wording is just ambiguous and both sides can make a good case.

Yep, just about to add it, but I'm not sure there is a concensus answer yet!

Despite what I said in that thread, i think you can't do both by the letter of the rules, due to the definition of what attack means, and when defenders are declared, but I'm not sure that was the designers intention....

2. How does the Forced action on the Dol Guldur beastmaster work? When is the extra shadow card applied, and as it uses the words "After xxx attacks" (in the same way that Chieftain Ufthak has) how does the Chieftain's forced action work in comparison?

Best guess: Dol Guldor beastmaster has two shadow cards dealt to it. Ufthak gets the resource token added after he has attacked once. The actions occur at different times in the combat phase, even though they both have the same wording. It is simply poor wording on the Beastmaster card.



I would disagree with this interpretation of Ufthak.  If you assume that "After" truly means "after the attack is complete", and not "when he attacks", then Dol Goldur makes no sense.  The extra shadow card is likely to be worthless most of the time.  Also, people have reported the Polish version of the card literally translates to "when".

Yes, I've just been reading that thread. I think the theory is that the Dul Guldor beastmaster should not use the word "After" at all. It should use the word "When"  whereas Ufthak uses the word "After". Currently the use of "After" is different depending on the card, in effect.

Ufthak becomes really powerful if his card text is changed is it taken to mean "when". His attack strength is more powerful than that of the Nazgul.

I will add the Polish part to the FAQ though, to give the two basic options...

I want to know what "eligible enemy target" means on the Quick Strike card. Can I attack enemies in the staging area or only ones I'm already engaged with? Can I attack other players enemies when I use this even if my character isn't RANGED? I feel like if you could only use this against enemies you were already engaged with it would have said "an enemy you are engaged with." So far I've been interpreting this card as that I can attack enemies in the staging area.

I play that eligible means "If it was the Combat Phase and you could normally declare that character as an attacker against that enemy." That would mean only Dunhere can attack Enemies in Staging and Ranged characters could attack Enemies engaged with other players. Other characters would have to attack Enemies engaged with you.

If Dul Guldor used "When" it would literally be the only card in the game that uses "Response: When..."  I fail to see how you can say that one use of "After" means "When", but all the rest mean "After".  I don't question that he is powerful, but it really seems like wishful interpretation to me.

Anyway, keep up the good work.  This is a great resource for people in between FAQs.  I maintain the unofficial FAQ for W:I, and I know how much work it can be after a release.

Also, if you are really motivated, try to follow the threads at BGG.  You will be more likely to find semi-official answers there (mostly from Zambo), as FFG generally doesn't want their employees posting on their own forums (not sure why, but that's how it is) (also I don't know if that guy is even an FFG employee).

I was wondering if someone could confirm how shadow cards are handled for engaged enemies with a forest snare card attached.  Currently, I am handling this situation by dealing a shadow card to the enemy in question, but then discarding the shadow card without any effect (effectively burning an encounter card).  I'd be keen to understand what the official ruling is for this situation - not sure if this has already been addressed anywhere else?

You're handling it correctly.  Engaged Enemies are dealt a Shadow card, then because of the Forest Snare it can't attack so the Shadow card is just discarded with no effect.

From the Tournament Deckbuilding and Customization section on page 27:

"A tournament deck must contain a minimum of 50 cards. Additionally, no more than three copies of any card, by title, can be included in a player’s deck. Within these guidelines any combination of allies, attachments, and events can be used in the player deck."

The rules don't preclude you from adding cards in from other Spheres.  The question is: why would you want to have unplayable cards in your deck?

Stand and Fight Spirit Recursion decks where you discard the card with Eowyn and then bring it back with Stand and Fight. That way you can play powerful non-Spirit cards using only Spirit resources. Apparently the deck does fairly well by using delay tactics until it can get allies like Beorn and Faramir out. 

 

Of course you might already know this and asked the question to get people to figure out the answer themselves. Now those looking through the FAQ know the secret too.

All the rulings I see at the beginning of this thread look solid except for #4.  It's the latter; you're able to allocate the damage as you see fit - that way, Stand Together can save a character from dying if the right defenders are chosen and damage is chosen accordingly.

First you can only Travel during the Travel Phase so the Threat Strength (a huge 5) will count against you on the turn that it is revealed. Second to Travel there needs to be no Active Location. If you already have an Active Location then you will need to finish exploring that Location first before your can Travel to the Brown Lands.

Once you do Travel there however the Forced kicks in and it is automatically explored for you and then discarded like most explored locations.

So the only time you can really play feint is the portion of the combat phase where players have a chance to play actions after shadow cards are dealt?

Thanks for doing the work to compile these questions and keep things up to date.

Largely I think the consensus rulings fit the "does this make sense" criterion, which is good, and a sign of a well designed game.

The two that (in my opinion) fail that criterion are :

Surge has an effect outside of the quest phase?  Really?  The rules clearly define "Surge"  in terms of what it does during the quest phase.  That's more than just clarifying, that's changing the rules as written.

And, I'm probably in the minority on this one, but to me the Aragorn / Theodred interaction, and the Strength of Will / Old Forest Road interaction ruling, just doesn't sit well.  "Response" in the rulebook is defined as something that is done "immediately after" the action that you are responding to.  That consensus ruling seems to go against that English language meaning of "immediately after" and bend it to "sometime after in the same phase, and if there are multiple responses possible, do them in whatever order you want".

Since both of these amount to rule book changes (an override in the first case, and needing clear statement of unwritten rules in the second) it'd be good if rulings said more than just "yes" or "no" for the specific question.  Rather, the rulings should gave a restatement of the definition of "surge" in the first case, how a general statement of how the timing of actions and responses in a phase are to be handled in the second case.

Not entirely.  You can play actions generally while choosing the order in which attacks are resolved.  So here are a couple of other instances you can play Feint:

 

1. You have two Enemies you're engaged with - you resolve the first attack, then before the second attack resolves, play Feint to prevent the other Enemy from attacking.

2. You are playing with a friend.  You are the first player and have one Enemy engaged with you; your friend has one as well.  You resolve the Enemy's attack, then before the Enemy engaged with your friend can attack you play Feint, thus preventing it from attacking.

As for your other issues, given Driven by the Shadow's text yes you could discard Caught in a Web with it. Also see this thread on Board Game Geek [http://boardgamegeek.com/article/6654218#6654218], Zambo IIRC playtested the game and confirms. I do agree a FAQ entry will be nice but I fully expect it to not consider encounter cards to be under the control of the player whose character it is on.



Wait, I said in that thread that you cannot discard Caught in a Web with Driven by the Shadow's shadow effect!

Thanks for doing the work to compile these questions and keep things up to date.

Largely I think the consensus rulings fit the "does this make sense" criterion, which is good, and a sign of a well designed game.

The two that (in my opinion) fail that criterion are :

Surge has an effect outside of the quest phase?  Really?  The rules clearly define "Surge"  in terms of what it does during the quest phase.  That's more than just clarifying, that's changing the rules as written.

And, I'm probably in the minority on this one, but to me the Aragorn / Theodred interaction, and the Strength of Will / Old Forest Road interaction ruling, just doesn't sit well.  "Response" in the rulebook is defined as something that is done "immediately after" the action that you are responding to.  That consensus ruling seems to go against that English language meaning of "immediately after" and bend it to "sometime after in the same phase, and if there are multiple responses possible, do them in whatever order you want".

Since both of these amount to rule book changes (an override in the first case, and needing clear statement of unwritten rules in the second) it'd be good if rulings said more than just "yes" or "no" for the specific question.  Rather, the rulings should gave a restatement of the definition of "surge" in the first case, how a general statement of how the timing of actions and responses in a phase are to be handled in the second case.



 

I missed these rulings in the OP.  Let me address them:

 

1. Surge has no effect outside the Quest Phase and does not trigger if revealed in any other phase.  I'm not sure where anyone got this impression.

2. In both of these examples, cards contain multiple Responses: to the same trigger.  In the Aragorn/Theodred instance, both are committing to a quest at the same time if controlled by the same player (this isn't explicitly stated in the rulebook, but will be addressed in the FAQ).  Hence, both Responses: are applicable and the player gets to decide what order the Responses: are resolved since they are triggered by the same game event.  In the same way, Strength of Will and Old Forest Road have multiple Responses: triggered by the same game event (traveling to Old Forest Road).  As the Aragorn/Theodred argument, the player gets to decide the order in which these Responses: are resolved.

You're handling it correctly.  Engaged Enemies are dealt a Shadow card, then because of the Forest Snare it can't attack so the Shadow card is just discarded with no effect.



I'm engaged with 2 enemies, and one of them has Forest Snare.  I resolve the unsnared attack first, and it has some Shadow effect that causes me to destroy the Snare.  Does the other enemy now attack me (probably)?  Do I have any option to "resolve" the Snared enemy first (doubtful)?  Basically, I'm asking if the game checks for valid attackers before attacking starts, or if additional valid attackers can be added during combat.

I'll make sure that Combat timing is clarified in the FAQ, because the order in which you can do things is ambiguous in the rulebook.  In the "Resolving Enemy Attacks" section on page 18, step 1 it states to "Choose an enemy.  The first player chooses which attack (among the enemies to which he is engaged) to resolve first."  Since the Forest Snared enemy can't attack, it can't be chosen for this step, so you would resolve the other one, the Forest Snare is discarded, then you would resolve the previously-Snared enemy's attack.

Also on pg. 18: "The first player repeats these 4 steps for each enemy that he is engaged with."  So there is an ongoing check for valid attackers it seems, not just at the start of the Combat Phase.

I think you are stuck with this one. Since the ensnared enemy can't attack, there is nothing to resolve there. Then, the second one attacks and makes the first one a viable attacker again. Then, it would resolve. Another big problem is that you may not have designated a defender for it, anticipating that it could not attack. Ouch!  

Edit: Nevermind, I failed to see it was answered already.

My bad. I found the thread but the question specifically stated turning an objective card and covering it with a surge card during the quest phase.

So, i guess then, as in the case of the Necromancer's tower, if an objective card is placed in staging as part of set up and a surge encounter card is turned to cover it, the surge keyword IS ignored?

I'll update the FAQ

It's okay - that's correct, only time Surge keyword works (as the rules are written) is during the Quest Phase.  This may change in the FAQ, but I don't see why it would.

I would rule that you have the option of choosing either since they have the exact same trigger condition ("At the end of the phase"), but that's definitely one for the FAQ!

 I think one thing is incorrect in your FAQ on #16.  I think the answer should be "Each enemy can only be attacked once per game round."

On page 20 of the rules, it says "A player has the opportunity to declare 1 attack against each enemy with which he is engaged.".  Later it says "After a player's first attack has resolved, he can declare another attack against any eligible enemy character that he has not yet attacked this round".  As it stands I think the rule book is clear on this and the answer in this FAQ makes it more confusing.

Thoughts?

I don't think saying that each enemy can only be attacked once per round is quite accurate, after looking at the Ranged keyword. Ranged characters can attack enemies engaged with other players, even if the other player has already had combat with those enemies. Which means that a single enemy could theoretically be attacked twice; once by the active player whose characters are attacking and once by the other player. Unless I'm interpreting it wrong, and if so, I apologize.

I think technically you can do this but it doesn't make much sense to do so really, as the defence rating of the enemy is then subtracted from the ranged characters attack, whereas if the ranged character attacks at the same time as the engaged players characters, the defence rating would only be applied once.

I think the statement is there to ensure that the ranged character can attack an enemy engaged with another player even if that players characters don't attack that eneny this round.

But currently, by the letter of the rules, i think you are right.

I'll update the wording with this in mind to try and make it less confusing.

When you reach the third phase of the quest, you randomly select one of the 3a cards. If you select Beorn's path, then all you need to do is place sufficient progress tokens on it to complete that phase and succeed in the quest. If you pull the other one, then you must beat U-spawn, but don't need to obtain any more progress tokens.

Its and either/or situation to win

I don't really see the problem with Dol Guldur Beastmaster being "After" the attack. There are a lot of shadow effects that don't add attack value or similar. You'd probably whiff on it anyway if there's a lot of locations and such left in the deck. It's still potentially a nasty effect, but it only "nullifies" a couple of shadow effects, like the Dol Guldur Orcs and Despair and whatnot.

Any excess damage after the defending character is destroyed is applied as threat.

So you deduct defence as normal, then apply the rest as wounds. If this is enough to destroy the character then any excess damage (beyond what it took to destroy the character) is applied as threat.

Example 1 : Hero with defence 2 hit points 5

Hill troll hits with strength 6, minus defence 2 leaves 4 damage. Hero down to 1 hit point, no threat added.

Hero hit again next round, strength 6, minues defence 2 leaves 4 damage. 1 damage is enough to destroy hero, so the excess damage is 3 (4 damage - 1 hit point remaining), so that adds 3 threat.

Example 2: Ally with 0 defence 1 hit point.

Hill troll hits for strength 6, minus 0 defence, is 6 damage. Ally has 1 hit point, so the ally is destroyed and 5 threat (6 damage - 1 hit point) is added to players tracker.

Dol Guldur Beastmaster works as you guess.

the word 'after he attacks' means "if any effects hasn't denied the attack".

In this way only shadow card is placed on the card. If the attack is resolved, then you add another one and appy both. If not, you discard just one shadow card.

Indeed I see no reason why it would not be the choice of the player. Even if two monsters have the same threat level pick one. If your fellow players threat is lower its not even an issue as they will both end up engaging you anyway during the engagement checks. If in the rare chance two monsters have the same threat level and both players have the same or higher threat then player one picks which of the two engages him and then player two. I would discuss it amongst yourselves as there might be one of the two monsters that is easier for one player to take down vs the other player.

only one enemy engages per engagement check so if two enemies are tied players should agree on which one engages 1st player and then the other would engage the 2nd player if their threat is high enough for it to auto engage. if 2nd players threat is not high enough then it is not an issue and both would end up engaging player 1st player anyway.

Sorry if this answered before but if there is an active location on a quest card with 0 tokens and the quest card has 4 tokens and despair has just revealed you must remove the 4 tokens on the quest card or nothink huppens cause active location has 0 tokens?

I would play it that the quest loses its 4 tokens, given that there are a number of cards who specifically refer to either locations or quests. The location's buffer role does not apply, imo.

I think the is a sort of precedence for this in the rules, in that the active location acts as a buffer for the current quest, AND excess tokens from travelling to an active location are applied to the quest therefore the reverse should also be true.

What this means then in that if the active location had 2 tokens on, and dispair arrived, you'd remove 2 from the location and then 2 from the quest.

Conversely, if the active location had no tokens, you'd remove all 4 from the quest.

Worthwhile getting a response to this in the official FAQ though.

Anyone agree/disagree strongly with the summary above? If a few concur with it, i'll add it to the unofficial FAQ thread.

It needs adding to the FAQ for sure, but right now I would rule that they come off the quest only.  There is nothing in the rules to say "when tokens are removed from a quest, remove them from an active location first".  Hopefully this will be clarified.

  "excess tokens from travelling to an active location are applied to the quest therefore the reverse should also be true" => we're not in a world in which we're guessing what the rules are. We're in a world where we play the game by the book, and if something is not written in the book, it doesn't exist.

So, as long as an official errata doesn't modify it, Despair removes progression tokens only from the quest, and not from anything else.

You need to interpret the rules as little as possible.

Have to agree.  Location is irrelevant.

When Revealed: Remove 4 progress tokens from the current quest card. (If there are fewer then 4 progress tokens on the quest, remove all progress tokens from that quest.)

It doesn't even come into play in the card text.  Remember that if a card contradicts a rule in the rulebook the card is what we go with.  Not that there is anything about the rulebook here, but we shouldn't be trying make a rulebook rule fit when the card overides the written rulebook anyway.

 26. Can you place an attachment on another players hero? Does the hero need to be of the same sphere as the attachment?

Official: Any character that meets the requirements of the attachment can recieve the attachment. Unless specifically stated as a requirement on the card, you can play attachments on any hero (or character if the attachment allows), including another players' and/or one that is a different sphere to which the attachment belongs

 

 

 

Are you sure about this?

To quote the all-mighty book of rules: "Phase 2: Planning - ...... after a player plays an ally or attachment card from his hand, he places it faceup and ready in his play area"

Seems to me that if you go by the rules you can only play attachments on cards belonging to you. If this rule has been altered somehow, does that mean you can play allies into another player´s play area as well?

Indeed I see no reason why it would not be the choice of the player. Even if two monsters have the same threat level pick one.

I would discuss it amongst yourselves as there might be one of the two monsters that is easier for one player to take down vs the other player.



 

This is exactly why i would like to know if it is truly a players choice.  There are some decks that just cannot handle monsters as well as other decks and giving choice to the players seems especially powerful.  Everything else in the game is ramped up for maximum carnage and it seems out of character for the game to give away such a position to players choice IMO.

If the enemies threat level is the same then they are likely to be comparable in strength etc anyway. so choosing one over the other is unlikely to give the players too much of an advantage.

The "current quest" problem (num 32 of this unofficial FAQ). I think the current unofficial answer is against one of the most important rules of all good games: simplicity.

Misty Mountain Goblins, Despair, Blade of Gondolin, Legolas are the cards the ask to "remove" or "place" progress tokens to the "current quest".

Thematically, I see very easy to think that the current active location IS THE CURRENT EXPLORATION of my heroes. When they travel, "Any progress tokens that would be placed on a quest card are instead placed on the active location." because they are exploring that location. So this is their current EXTENSION to the current quest and this is easy to understand.

Imo it's a good thing that Legolas and the Blade of Gondolin put progress tokens on the current exploration and in the same way we must remove from the current exploration the progress tokens required by encounter cards like Goblins or Despair.

We don't want to have two different arbitrary solutions to the same wording "current quest", do we?

Imo, the simpliest thing to do is:

1) put the active location OVER the quest stage card (and its tokens, if any), so I use effectively the location buffer without any chance to forget to place or remove tokens from the buffer.

2) treat in the same way all the cards that have the same wording: "current quest" must always have the same meaning on all cards, for simplicity. So if my hero PLACE 1 progress token , I place it on the "current quest" that includes the "active location buffer" and if I must REMOVE 1 progress token, I remove it from the same "current quest" that includes the "active location buffer". If I don't have any token in the active location, I must remove it from the current quest, if any.

But on the "remove from the current quest" topic I really need an entry on the official FAQ.

I hope FFG will seek for simplicity.

With regard to question number 32, I kind of agree with sorty's opinion.

Misty Mountain Goblins, Blade of Gondolin, and Legolas all say to place (or remove) progress tokens from the current quest.

However, the Despair card says "remove 4 progress tokens from the current quest card." 

Emphasis mine.

So, if we assume that all the wording in the game is intentional and not just poor editing--and, until they come out with an official FAQ, I don't see why we shouldn't assume that it's intentional--then this seems to suggest that the first three cards are directed toward the quest as a whole, which then falls under the part of the rules that says that any active location acts as a buffer for the quest.  The Despair card, on the other hand, seems to override that restriction and tells the player to go directly to the quest card without regard to the quest as a whole (essentially, ignoring the active location).

Technically, you are right, I saw the difference between "current quest" and "current quest card" but I hoped it's only "poor editing". I like simplicity.

I play it the way Sorty suggests despite what I have put in the FAQ. If there is an active location, then progress tokens are added or removed from that card rather than the main quest.

@Sorty I think the reason the two responses in the FAQ contradict is that there is some wording in the rulebook, to do with active locations, that states "any progress tokens" (are added to the location rather than the quest card), which has been used to justify the idea that Legolas should put tokens on the active location in lieu of the quest card. Unfortunately, there is no such wording to back up any notion that cards such as MMG or Despair should remove tokens from an active location rather than the quest card. Therefore the FAQ seems contradictory, but it is based on the best information we currently have available.

I hope and expect when the official FAQ comes out, this will be clarified so that all cards and heros, even Despair, that specifically states quest card, work the same way, as you also suggest. I'm not sure which way FFG will go, but to me it makes sense that the active location is a buffer and therefore always acts as a buffer, which is why i play it that way currently.

Added. Although the answer is a bit wishy washy, because we don't really have a good concensus (I think I'd go with common sense personally). Its' tricky though because with a bit more common sense, you should probably also say they also have the Dol Guldor trait, but that isn't obvious from the name; its only obvious from the location of the quest and by looking at the other orc cards.

I don't think you should assume they have the Orc trait (even though they are Orcs)  While I'm guessing this is just an oversight, generally games that generate "token" creatures have completely blank text unless specified.

As far as Despair, I think in either case, you are assuming there is bad editing.  Creating a mechanic like "remove token from quests" and then having 1 single card work differently from that mechanic based on only a difference of the word "card" in the text, is still not a good way to write a card.  If it really is the one exception, then it should be much more explicit about it.  I play all the cards as if the location is just a buffer, and would be very surprised if that isn't how it works when the FAQ comes out.  Again though, its not a huge deal one way or the other, and I don't think it makes the game inherently easier/harder depending on how you play it.

pumpkin said:

4. If you defend with multiple characters and still take damage, how is that damage applied amongst the defenders?

BG: You can split the damage amongst the defenders as you see fit.



I noted on p.18 of the rulebook "only one character can be declared as a defender against each attacking enemy".  Unless there is something else that I have missed, the situation in question is invalid (as much as I wish I could defend in depth).

Pumpkin, can you change the unofficial FAQ answer number 32?

Now we have seen a lot more consensus in this forum:

The active location can be considered a buffer, an extension of the current quest, therefore we must remove tokens first from the extension and then from the quest card, if necessary.

The Despair card could be the only exception, but we hope it's a minor bad editing.

2) Scenario Journey Along the Anduin.
I have 9 progress tokens on the first stage (To the river needs 8). The stage cannot be defeated, because Hill Troll is still in play. I kill it with Legolas.

For Protector of Lorien, you're taking an action to discard 1 card. Then, if you choose to take another action to discard 1 card, you can add another Willpower or Defense. Each discard is treated separately.

If this works anything like CoC (and I suspect it does), the Forest Snare remains on the enemy. The condition was met for playing Forest Snare in that the enemy was engaged with a character. There was nothing specific triggered to remove Forest Snare, so it stays on him until specifically removed, or the creature dies.

As for your other question, I'm also curious about how Progress Tokens are properly played. I know that if you have traveled to a location, any additional Progress Tokens splash onto the Quest Card, but I don't know if they splash to another Quest Card. In your specific example, if Progress Tokens splash to the next Quest Card, then the order is moot. If they don't, however, then I believe the active player (or maybe first player?) gets to choose which effect is resolved first. When the Hill Troll dies, Legolas' ability and Quest step resolution happen simultaneously. In that case, the active player can choose for the quest resolution to occur first, and then Legolas' ability. Am I thinking about this correctly? Either way, I'd like to know if Progress Tokens can splash from one Quest step to another.

No, progress tokens do not carry over from one quest to the next. It's in the rulebook, somewhere near the end in a separate paragraph on quest progress.

@Mestrahd

1) No, you can't. There is no action window between "when revealed" ability of Necromancer's Reach and playing a Response to NR's effect. But you can do use Unexpected Courage after commiting characters to the quest and between revealing card from encounter deck (just in case:)

2) As ClydeCloggie said. Additional points are lost, you can't place it on the next quest (p.22 of the rulebook)

I have 2 questions.

1) Is there any time to pseudo-respond to a "When Revealed" effect? I'm thinking of Necromancer's Reach and Unexpected Courage. Can I use Unexpected Courage in response to flipping Necromancer's Reach to avoid taking the damage? 

2) If I have a quest with 6/8 counters and gain 4 during a quest phase with no active location, do I add 2 counters to the next quest, or are the extras lost?

 

 

 

1) Nope, once it is revealed you deal with the effects. Only a Response will let you stop it. There is however an action step before all the cards are revealed and you could have used that to Ready your hero but you need to do that before you nee Necromancer's Reach.

2) No, this rule is mentioned in Quest Advancement on page 22. Excess progress tokens go from the active location to the quest but NOT from one stage of the quest to another.

 

Edit: That will teach me for not refreshing before responding...

With the Shadow Card that makes you discard an attachment, I would argue you can get rid of Caught In A Web.  On p25 of the Rulebook:  "Players always assume control of Attachments that have been played on their characters".

Yes you would argue but this has been argued before. A card that comes from the encounter deck is never considered as "being played" or "played". Only cards that comes from player's hands can be considered "played". So you do not control Caught in a Web. This is official.

Question, not sure if it is answered yet.

 

Last scenario with Nazgul says that only one ally card played per round for entire group. Do ally cards played out of Planning Phase count for this? Example: Sneak Attack

 

We played today that you could use card text to bypass the rule and that "one ally card per round" was in Planning Phase only.

As it does not specify "during the Planning Phase," I read it as one Ally per round, regardless of how that Ally comes into play (i.e., Stand and Fight, Sneak Attack, etc).

I disagree as it says the players can only play one per round. Whereas sneak attack says Put into play. Put into play and Play is an important distinction I have learned from AGoT which is made by the same designer.

Toqtamish is 100% right.

The Necromancer's Tower says: The players, as a group, cannot play more then 1 ally card each round. If you put an ally into play, you bypass that restriction (Sneak Attack, Stand and Fight, Brok Ironfist).

For now there are no cards that allow you to play an ally outside the planning phase. But if there were any, you still can play only 1 ally per round, not only per planning phase, when TheNecromancer's Tower is the active quest.

Maybe another question for the FAQ:

If the first card attached to an objective is a location with "surge" keyword, I reveal another card from the encounter deck but where do I place this new "surged" card? Do I attach it to the objective, together with the first encounter card - and both of them are protecting the same objective card - or do I place it separately in the staging area?

 

I posted the same question on bgg and there are very different answers, so I think this could be added to the FAQ.

 

What do you think, anyway?

You're right, thank you a lot! 

One more question - should I exhaust Dunhere after I use his ability (Dunhere can target enemies in the staging area when he attacks alone. When doing so, he get +1 attack.)?

Does "enemies", in this card description, mean - as many as there is in the staging area, or only one enemy in the staging area?

Yes, since you have to exhaust to attack.  Card says "when he attacks", so he needs to be exhausted. Otherwise, you could just repeatedly attack with him over and over again on the same turn.

I would place it separately as nothing says in the rules that an objective can have several cards protecting it.

"Surge" says to reveal another card, just like it was another card you would have revealed anyway. So in a multiplayers game, if the first card revealed is an objective, you draw another one to protect it. If it has Surge, you draw another one as if it was the encounter card of the next player (but you will still have to draw one for him of course).

Am i right in thinking that in Scenario 3, you wouldn't resolve the Surge keyword on the Guarded Objectives at the start of the game (or Doomed for that matter).  Both of these keywords say that when the card is revealed in the Staging step of the Quest phase - whereas in Scenario 3 they are played in the pre-game setup.

Page 24 of the rulebook:

 

"When an encounter card with the surge keyword is
revealed during the staging step of the quest phase,
reveal 1 additional card from the encounter deck.
Resolve the surge keyword immediately after resolving
any when revealed effects on the card."

 

The surge word would be ignored when the card is revealed outside of the quest phase (including the setup phase).

 Doomed has the same limitations as Surge (may want to mention both of them together in the FAQ).

I don't understand the answer to #24 "How does Beorn's ability work with sneak attack"?  Basically are you saying he can end up in your discard pile or your hand, your choice?

 If you have two Caught in a Web cards attached to a single hero, does it cost 4 resources to ready him or only 2 (I think only 2).

Escape from Dol Guldur 1B, assuming Sneak Attack and Stand and Fight can be used to put Allies into play still.

With Dungeon Torch, do you raise your threat by a total of 2 or 3 at the end of each game round?

I've updated with your comments, apart from the last two questions above, which need some form of answer before being added to main thread.

As for CiaW, question 31 answers this; each attachment is treated seperately and individual card costs must be paid independently. Therefore if you have two CiaW attachments, it costs 4 resource to refresh that hero.

About the "After xxx attacks" = "When xx attacks" wording.

Currently in the unofficial FAQ, number 2 it is written:

"Best guess: The cards are best interpreted as having the word When rather than After. The polish version of the card actually has the word “When” rather than After. This means that DGB is dealt two shadow cards and Ufthak has an initial combat strength of 5 in the first round in which he engages a player (ouch!)."

But seriously, I don't care about what the polish translator has done.

I think that Nate French is working with LCG games from such a long time that he cannot do such mistakes and bad wording. I have faith in him. "AFTER" imho means AFTER not WHEN.

So please, don't trust polish translator and follow your good sense: if Nate says "After Chieftan Ufthak attacks, place 1 resource token on him" we do it.  First time he attacks with 3, second time with 5 and so on. Let's kill this damned before it becomes too strong. This is good sense, isn't it?

And if you think Ufthak is a good example, why not thinking that every other card that says "after..." is REALLY after and not "when"? Give it a try, you will discover that the game is more easy to understand than we have thought.

My two cents.

AFTER Dol Guldur attacks, you deal another shadow card, so most of the times you don't have to do nothing, 'cause there is no shadow text or the shadow effect doesn't apply, but sometimes you DO have to face something like removing progress tokens and so on... Dol Guldur attacks with ONE shadow card, the other one you deal is a side-effect of its attack that happens AFTER you resolve the attack. In the future, expansions could add other shadow effects that deal damage directly.

Well, nothing against your high opinion of Nate French or against Mr. French himself, but I'd like to note that the CoC AP cycle he worked on was riddled with errors, most notably it included game terms that only exist in AgoT. Nobody's perfect; Mr. French is not an exception.

Also, the terms 'when' and 'after' are used interchangably in CoC. Here's the relevant excerpt from the current CoC FAQ:

Some cards use the term “when” and others use the term “after” for their timing (ie. When this character commits versus After this character
commits). Is this a timing distinction?
No. For all timing purposes, these cards should operate in the same timing window.

These are very bad news. I don't know other LCGs so I couldn't imagine the existence of such problems. My apologize.

I hope mr.French have done it better this time. But now I'm not so sure. I'm feeling sick...omg.

In this game the attack phase is really the sum of several steps... we cannot play with cards with text  "after xxx attacks" that changes meaning from card to card... hope French will choose one meaning for all the cards, or else it's really bad news.

My precious... is getting corrupted?

Until the official FAQ comes out, here is how I am playing it.  Might be right, might be wrong, who knows.

Beastmaster:  I'm playing this according to the polish translation.  "When" it attacks, deal it another card.  So it gets 2 cards.  The idea of it getting another card AFTER the attack has resolved is just odd.

Chieftan: It's first attack is 3.  AFTER the attack has resolved, it gets a counter

Wargs: I'm also playing this as AFTER the attack has resolved, otherwise it would declare as an attack and then run off back to the staging area before damage was dealt.  This cant be right.

So, in summary, I think AFTER should mean "after it is completed" and Beastmaster should actually read "when"

 

Wording on other cards in the LCG has been a little disappointing.  Keywords from AgoT somehow appearing on cards in CoC and different things meaning something different for each game.  Since I play all of them, it's tricky trying to remember the differences.

 I might have made a mistake earlier: I think Doomed and When Revealed do both execute before and Response events that might destroy the enemy or complete the location, and then Surge executes separately.  Doomed and Surge are ignored if they appear outside of the Quest Staging phase.

 

Have we had any responses in here about Despair and Misty Mountain Goblins? Zambo on BGG said that the current location acts as a buffer for both encounter cards, but there is some disagreement on BGG because one uses "quest" and the other uses "quest card".  And what happens if there are no progress tokens on the current location (or not enough in the case of Despair), does the overflow take away from the quest card at that point?

The results of the conversations here are summarised in FAQ 20 and 32. Generally we agree with Zambo, disreagarding any slight wording changes on the card as just poor editing.

Since Doomed and Surge are ignored outside the questing phase, the Q&A about Objective cards is confusing.  Most of the time (for now) objective cards are only revealed and placed during setup of the 3rd quest.  In that case, the Surge is ignored, but the answer says you resolve it.

I agree with you except for Beastmaster. I play that after means after. Therefore, he's dealt one shadow card during the attack and one after. Of the current shadow effects, probably 75% have no bearing on whether or not the enemy is in combat. The only ones that do are the +atk effects and they only exist on 3-4 different cards. So, the second shadow effect is just as likely to be potent as the first one.

My feeling is that "attack" is pretty clearly defined in the rulebook as having 4 substeps from declaring attackers to determining combat damage. So I read these cards as "After determining combat damage..."

The problem with this is: Beastmaster doesn't say anything about resolving the shadow card.  So if you play it this way, why would you ever reveal and trigger the shadow card?  You've already gone past step 3 of resolving the enemy attack.  So then in my opinion the card would just be dealt and then discarded at the end of the Combat phase.

If they meant it this way, I think they would have said "After Dol Gul Beastmaster attacks, deal and immediately resolve an additional shadow card."

Zambo over on BGG was a playtester and confirmed that the intention is for the Beastmaster to have 2 shadow cards while resolving the attack.

The "resolving" is as much implied as "When he attacks" is. Your argument practically defeats itself. It's clear there's poor wording on the card, but whether the Polish version is the true text or just a mistranslation has yet to be discovered. They will have to produce a FAQ with wording to the effect of "and resolve it" or change it to "When". Until then, I think playing it either way has merit.

I think Paul has it right here. It makes sense. It is easier for me to believe that the above descriptions are how the cards were meant to be played. I suppose one could easily argue the Chieftain either way, but if you interpret Beastmaster & Wargs in any way other than what Paul said above, then why bother at all?

Until the official FAQ comes out, here is how I am playing it.  Might be right, might be wrong, who knows.

Beastmaster:  I'm playing this according to the polish translation.  "When" it attacks, deal it another card.  So it gets 2 cards.  The idea of it getting another card AFTER the attack has resolved is just odd.

Chieftan: It's first attack is 3.  AFTER the attack has resolved, it gets a counter

Wargs: I'm also playing this as AFTER the attack has resolved, otherwise it would declare as an attack and then run off back to the staging area before damage was dealt.  This cant be right.

So, in summary, I think AFTER should mean "after it is completed" and Beastmaster should actually read "when"

 

Wording on other cards in the LCG has been a little disappointing.  Keywords from AgoT somehow appearing on cards in CoC and different things meaning something different for each game.  Since I play all of them, it's tricky trying to remember the differences.

 

 

I think Paul has it right here. It makes sense. It is easier for me to believe that the above descriptions are how the cards were meant to be played. I suppose one could easily argue the Chieftain either way, but if you interpret Beastmaster & Wargs in any way other than what Paul said above, then why bother at all? The interpretation seems to go against what the game is trying to accomplish.

I haven't played enough to run into the Chieften or Wargs, but did run into the Beastmaster last night when playing with my nephew (who I was teaching the game to). He asked about it and I said, well, we  put it out after even though it seemed useless. So upon seeing what Paul said and re-thinking it, I will play it as you play it "when" so there will be a chance of 2 shadow card effects. Otherwise why bother putting  a second one out there after the attack is resolved?

 Attacking is not comparing offense vs defense and dealing damage. This is the last step of the attacking phase.

Attacking starts with Choose an enemy. From this moment the chosen enemy is considered as attacking. 

So I play everything that says "after X attacks" right after X's attack has been chosen to be resolved.

So then you would deal the Beastmaster 2 Shadow Cards as soon as you choose that enemy to attack you and then reveal those Shadow Cards normally before you resolve that attack on your defender. Right? happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]

- First you deal 1 shadow card to each enemy engaged with you. So the Beastmaster has his 1st one.

- Then, when I decide that it's his turn to attack, I deal him another one.

- Finally I resolve both during the step "Resolve shadow effect"

That's how I play it and how it seems to make sense to me.

That doesn't really differ a great deal from Paul's suggestion, except that the actual cards DGB gets may be slightly different.

I definitely think the intent of the card is for it to have two shadow cards, with potentially two effects to resolve when shadow effects normally resolve; quite how you choose to get to that point is less important.

I've seen some people saying they are dealing the 2nd shadow card literally after the attack has resolved, and then only applying it if the effect is relevant at that point, for me that option is non-sensical.

What do you do with Wargs though?

About the encounter Deck. I have bought multiple Core And have put 3 of every card into the deck as per the "Deck Construction" rules.

I noticed it is slightly easier in single player to win but harder in multiplayer.

Is this correct or acceptable? I could not find anything to reference this.

The "resolving" is as much implied as "When he attacks" is. Your argument practically defeats itself. It's clear there's poor wording on the card, but whether the Polish version is the true text or just a mistranslation has yet to be discovered. They will have to produce a FAQ with wording to the effect of "and resolve it" or change it to "When". Until then, I think playing it either way has merit.



All I'm saying is if you think it occurs after the attack is complete, the second shadow card is useless (which almost certainly wasn't the intention).  If you think it occurs before the attack, then Chieftan gets a bonus on his first attack, which may or may not be what was intended.  All I'm going on is Zambo who was a playtester and his comments in this thread:

Sorry, but just being a playtester doesn't make someone an expert on anything. Zambo has stated somewhere that he was never employed by FFG, so his opinion is that of a person with more playing time than us, that's all. I was a closed beta tester for World of Warcraft, but does that make me an end all expert on WOW? I hardly think so. AFAIK, playtesters for this game are like all beta participants, they're given the game and try to break it, with no interaction with the developers.

Long story short, until Nate French gives us official templating (since it's his game) then we can play it how it makes sense.

Another Thalin question.  His text says "When revealed BY the encounter deck" -- I hate to nitpick, but I am honestly confused by the word "BY" here.  It seemed to me to imply the encounter deck must have agency, while my questing companion interpreted it to mean "from the encounter deck."

So the question is: If the player searches the deck for a card (i.e. pulling out the boss spider from one of the quest cards), does this trigger Thalin's ability?  According to the rules, he is still considered to be committed to a quest, so that's not in question.  But it seems to me the spiders are being revealed BY the players (or perhaps BY the quest deck) but not BY the encounter deck, as per his text.

Not sure what was the intent.  Seems like if it was how I played it that it could have been made more clear (i.e. when revealed during the staging phase).  I would guess I was being too nitpicky, but on the starter quest, I figured better to play the ruling that makes it harder rather than easier.

Personally, I'd go with it meaning "from". If FFG really wanted these sorts of specific nuances to be realised from the cards, the rulebook would have been 200 odd pages long to fully cover all the different card wordings and what their exact interpretation was supposed to be. IMO!

When I play I try and intepret the card in the simplest, most obvious fashion, rather than honing in on a specifc word, so in my games Thalin deals damage whenever a card is placed in the staging area during the quest phase regardless of how it got there, provided he is questing.

This is partly from a thread on BGG where Zambo answers the questions as above and partly based on the definition of unclaimed.

I think if the hero dies they go back to the staging area; the only time they go to the discard pile is if dungeon jailer comes along while they are unclaimed and in the staging area.

Thanks for the answer.  That makes sense.  One detail though, if I remember right, it wasn't during the quest phase.  We have completed a quest using Legolas's ability, and the next phase caused us to search out and bring in two spiders.  Thalin is still considered "questing" even though it isn't quest phase, if I remember right, so I assumed his ability still triggered in other phases.

if detached, and that's the case with dead heroes, objectives go back to the staging area - the skeleton guy also mentions that (forgot the name) in his shadow card text...

 

I would like to think, that guarded objectives are not moved back into the encounter deck due to dungeon jailer - like this:

 

Dungeon Jailer "I'm gonna take a look after the objectives!!!!!!!!!! Arrgh! Anybody guarding the Shadow Key?"

Orcs of Dol Guldur: "Us, us, us!!"

 

Jailer: "ok, good! Gandalf's Map well hidden?" Takes a peek at a certain location "Ok, well buried! What about Dungeon Torch? NO! Nobody guarding it - back to the encounter deck you burning piece of **** wood, ofc :DDD

 

The wording seems to suggest this: a guarded objective is NOT claimable "raise your threat by 2 to claim XXX, when IT IS FREE OF ENCOUNTERS. therefore, an objective can only be unclaimed (in the sense of Jailer) when it is claimable, but has not been claimed yet due to a tactical decision, or whatever. a guarded objective is not claimable and therefore not unclaimed, but guarded.

I'm almost certain that guarded objective cards do go in the encounter deck with dungeon jailor. A card that isn't eligible to be claimed because it's guarded is still unclaimed, and the jailer's wording includes all cards that are unclaimed for any reason, not just cards that are "unclaimed in claimable." There is nothing in the rules or the card text to indicate otherwise.

If this were true (and it could well be, we wont know until we get an updated official FAQ) then the word "unclaimed" would be superfluous.

Therefore the assumption is that the word unclaimed is included to distinguish between cards that are guarded and cards that are not guarded.

I agree that unclaimed means unguarded and not yet claimed. The Jailor card says "...shuffle 1 unclaimed objective card from the staging area back into the encounter deck."  So that excludes objectives attached to heroes anyway.

This doesn't make any sense to me. 'Unclaimed' to me distinguishes between Objectives that were claimed by a Hero and Objectives that weren't and as a result still sit in the SA. It doesn't need to distnguish between guarded and unguarded to have any meaning.  

So just based on the actual card text and not making any assumptions about what 'unclaimed' interacts with guarded/unguarded, I see no other way than that Dungeon Jailor affects all Objectives not claimed by Heroes, regardless of their Guarded status.

Whilst I agree that logically, any objective not claimed by a hero is unclaimed, even if it is guarded, I certainly hope this isn't what they meant. What with EfDG being impossibly hard anyway, the thought of a guarded objective card being discarded due to failed questing, where it needs to be suffled back into the encounter deck, only to come out as a shadow card (yes, personal experience here!) makes me want to cry!

On a related question, how are people understanding 'quested unsuccessfully' on Dungeon Jailer?:

1) at least one progress token added?

2) will power equal or better than threat (i.e. no increase to player threat dials)?

The rulebook states (pg 14) "if willpower higher, players have sucessfully quested", "if threat higher, players have unsucessfully quested" but doesn't clarify sucess for an evens situation.

Personally, I'm playing option 2 (no need to make things more difficult!)

 When threat and willpower are equal, the rulebook doesn´t say either "successful" or "unsuccessful" and so it is actually neither. And since the jailer ability activates from "unsuccessful" nothing happens.

 

Edit: and of course a card triggering from successful questing would not do anything either.

If Legolas has the Blade of Gondolin attached to him and defeats an enemy, are all three progress tokens placed simultaneously?

 

The scenario is as follows: No active location existing, a quest card with two progress tokens missing for completion.

Is it possible then to place the two progress tokens from Legolas on the quest card, complete it, and place the remaining progress token from the Blade of Gondolin on the next quest card?

 Since these are two distinct responses you should be able to do them in the order you choose. And since a quest with enough tokens should be removed immediately after the tokens are placed, you should then be able to place the blade tokens on the next stage. But I wont say that´s 100% certain.

As i remember the rules:

1. After you have placed the required amount of tokens on an active location, you can place the remaining tokens on the quest card.

2. You can not take remaining progress tokens from a finished quest card to the following quest card.

Hope i got this right.

That's correct except the argument is that the response on Legolas is a seperate response to that on the Blade card. Therefore you should be able to play one of the responses, then remove that quest card "immediately" then place the tokens from the other response on the next quest card.

So you can't split Legolas' 2 tokens across mutliple quests cards, but you could put the blades token on another quest card even though Legolas is using it.

1) What happens if you have no Heroes or Ally's left with which to defend an attack? Does one assign the full amount of damage to a single hero, in the case of Undefended?

2) Once a baddie becomes engaged to the player, and a Shadow card is dealt to that player, and the baddie isn't killed in the first round of combat, are additional Shadow cards dealt in subsequent rounds or just that first round.

1) If no one CAN defend or if no one CHOOSES to defend is the same thing. The attack is undefended.

2) As noted in the rulebook on page 20, all shadow cards, whether resolved or not, are discarded at the end of the combat phase.

Yes he still makes engagement checks. And engagement checks are made until no more enemies can engage anyone. So you can easily get more than two if there are plenty in the staging area.

- Does the "when revealed" action of a card trigger when it's revealed by a shadow effect or just when it's revealed due to a quest?

- How does "Wandering Took" work in single player? Is he useless?

1 - Only the part under the shadow effect separator bars is resolved when "revealing" a card for shadow effect. If it has none, it does nothing. For example, turning over a The Necromancer's Reach as a shadow card has no effect (you don't deal damage to your engaged characters).

2 - He's not useless, but his ability is. You can't give him to another player since you're alone. He remains a nice ally for 2 resources.

3 - Yes.

4 - Yes, after revealing new cards for the staging step of the quest phase.

36. Can a character such as Legolas or dunhere, who can attack enemies with which they are not engaged attack those enemies more than once per round using cards such as Unexepcted Courage?

In the rulebook it clearly states that a player cannot attack an enemy, with which they are engaged, more than once per round.

Legolas' Ranged keyword and Dunhere's ability clearly allow them to attack enemies with which the player is not engaged, overiding this rule but it is not clear which part of the rule is overridden.

Currently, there are basically two options

1. Legolas and Dunhere, can attack the same enemy twice, provided the player is not engaged with that enemy. In essence the characters special ability completely overrides the rule as stated in the rule book, allowing Legolas and Dunhere to attack the same enemy twice in a single round.

2. Although Legolas and Dunhere can attack enemies that are NOT engaged with the player, the limit of an enemy being attacked once per round, per player is still in force. In this case Legolas and Dunhere could not attack the same enemy using Unexpected Courage, although they could attack two different enemies in the same round.

There is no clear concensus on which option is correct, so take your pick until the official FAQ.

 

 

I would argue that Legolas can attack the same Creature twice, even if the player controlling him cannot declare more than one attack against the same creature. Simply because the Ranged ability says:

"A character can declare ranged attacks against these targets while its owner is declaring attacks, or it can participate in attacks that are declared by other players."

The way I see it is that the PLAYER is the one limited to declaring only one attack per creature per round.

So Legolas can attack once in my round and then again in my co-players round, becuase at that time he can participate in my CO-PLAYER's declaration. As the ability says.

So... this being said... I think I would also argue that Dunhere can only attack the same creature once, since I cannot come up with a way to allow another player to include him in a Declaration against the same enemy. But maybe there is one, I don't know.

Except the explanation of the ranged ability uses the word OR, so Legolas can attack a target using his ranged ability when Legolas' controller declares attacks OR Legolas can attack the same target using his ranged ability when other player's declare thier attacks.

Don't think he can do both (against a single target).

I agree with wolf.

I think the OR is going on the assumption that a ranged character exhausts to make the attacks, so you normally have to choose one.  It is possible that it means you can only do one or the other each round.  If that is the case, it's still possible for Legolas to attack the same enemy twice, but only in a 3-4 player game where another player also has ranged characters.  Legolas helps player 1 attack an enemy.  UC readies Legolas.  Player 2 chooses to also attack the enemy engaged with player 1 using something like Silverlode Archer, and Legolas also chooses to help.  Thus he gets to attack the same enemy twice while only attacking when other players declare attacks.  There are situations where you can actually do more damage that way.  Specifically enemies with high HP and a defense of 2 or less.

I agree with pumpkin. Rules, especially card game rules, generally use EXCLUSIVE OR. If this wasn't true then cards like Protector of Lorien would be able to give a hero both +1 Defense and +1 Willpower when you discarded a card. 

Admittedly the ranged rules are about procedure and might be INCLUSIVE OR but since all other attacks are limited to once per enemy I will assume you can do one or the other but not both.

In fact you can get BOTH, if you use the Action more than once discarding a card each time.

Just like using a card effect on Readying Legolas and attacking again. You use his Ranged Atack ability or more than once.

First time you chose one effect, second time you chose the other.

The only limitation I see for attacking the same Creature is PLAYER DECLARATION. I cannot find anything in the rules supporting the notion that Heroes or Allies would be limited to one attack per creature, per round. But a PLAYER is.

But I think we all agree this is a grey area where some official clarification would be very welcome indeed. I could be wrong.

With Protector I was meaning that if the OR was INCLUSIVE then by discarding a single card (and taking a single action) you could get both +1 Willpower and +1 Defense. (Sorry if my explanation was confusing)

I'll admit there is ambiguity in the rules which could go either way. Since only being able to attack each enemy once feel right and fits with player attack restriction (And I support exclusive or interpretations of the rules) I think that a ranged character could only attack any specific enemy once per turn.

..Which is why both options are offered in the FAQ.

To be honest, I'm not sure how your third option differs from option 1, in the FAQ, it just really gives a specific example that fits into option 1 doesn't it?

The reason I struggle with option 1, is that it is relatively convoluted to pull off, so why would FFG purposefully put that "combo" into play, while actively preventing other characters from benefiting from it?

The ranged keyword and Dunhere's ability is already good, do they really need a special layer placed on top using UC that other characters can't get?

Perhaps the 2nd question answers the first?

A complete assumption follows - Yes SoW can prevent the forced action, because you can play the response before the forced action occurs, however if it was a travel event, you could NOT prevent it with SoW because the travel event excutes at the point of travelling whereas SoW executes after travelling.

It's a neat answer that explains everything, but I'm not saying its right.

 

If you check out the latest news item for THfG http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=2373 [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=2373] then Strider's path can be used against travel effects but not forced effects, so there are certainly reasons why FFG have used both on the Location cards.

In my opinion my option is different in that it doesn't limit any Character to only attack attack a certain Creature once per turn. (That is the feeling I get from the FAQ as you wrote it, but I could be misstaken.)

The Only limitation I can find is around Player Declaration.

As long as the Player is limited to only declare ONE attack per Creature per Round, it doesn't really matter how many attacks a certain Character could perform.

But in Legolas case he has the ability to be included in OTHER Players Declarations.

You see your FAQ seems to Focus on the "Engaged with" part of it. I'm trying to apply ONE declaration per monster per round to ALL Monsters regardless of Engagements, but at the same time ALLOW Legolas to be included in other players attacks because that is what the Ranged ability says he can do.

... I'm sorry mate, but I feel like I'm doing a really crappy Job explaining my view here.

Option 1 said:

"Legolas and Dunhere, can attack the same enemy twice, provided the player is not engaged with that enemy. In essence the characters special ability completely overrides the rule as stated in the rule book, allowing Legolas and Dunhere to attack the same enemy twice in a single round."

Ok so I'm reading the rules like this:

1. A Player can only ever Declare ONE attack against the same Enemy per Round. (I would apply this to all Enemies, and ignore the "engaged with" part because it feels like that was the intention. Nothing will overrule this.)

2. There is nothing in the rules preventing a certain Character from Participating in more than one attack against the same Enemy in the same Round. The limitation only applies to Player Declaration. (Regardless of whether you use apply this rule on Engaged Enemies or not, it is still only limiting Player Declarations and not Characters. That is pretty clear to me at least.)

3. So by that rationale if more than one Player can include a certain Character in his Declaration should be allowed even if that Character has participated in an attack against the same creature earlier that round. In my opinion this does not "override" any rules. Since the rule only limits Player Declaration and not Character Participation.

And conserning this EXCLUSIVE OR thing I hear you and agree up to a point. Usually OR is exclusive.

But it is only EXCLUSIVE when you use it. And usually when you use something you "Exhaust" it or "Discard" it so the question becomes moot.

But I would argue that any card that is a) Readied again or b) brought back into play again, in short USED again, will allow for it's Controller to make that choice again. Right?

If for instance I have a Card that can be exhausted to give me A OR B. I Exhaust it and choose one or the other but not both. Right?

But if a card effect later Readies this card and I can use it again... which would be true:

a) I'm allowed to make a new choice, or,

b) I have to chose the same thing I did the first time, or,

c) It cannot be used again even though it is Readied.

I would go with A. Effectively this card has now given me A AND B.

As a Result, Ranged Characters can participate in Attacks Declared by me and all other Players around the Board provided I can Ready him between each Attack.

Done! I think originally the first couple of answers had best guess, with the remaining ones then abbreviated to BG, then at some time the best guess ones became official

I've sort of stopped using BG in the later posits though, so there's no total consistency now, some of those without BG could still only be forum based answers. If I get time, I'll try and go through and make them all accurate to properly distinguish official from BG.

Nice one. I tell you what is needed, when FFG answer questions in the FAQ they should try and give enough information into how the answer was determined so that we can then apply that logic to other cards. As an example, the FAQ for Dol Goldur Beastmaster and Chief Uftak explains how those cards are to be played, but doesn't explain if that is how "after" should be played or if the wording on the card was wrong. Because we don't know which is which we can't apply any logic to Wargs and we are left waiting for another FAQ update until everyone knows how Wargs should be played.

Assuming some logic is being applied to the FAQ answers, it would be good where possible to have that logic spelled out as well as the answer itself, I think.

Here's hoping...

Not a bad idea - Its not in there, and no other FAQ's seem to have a details reason in there.  However, do not fear, the reason why this was needed because of the first FAQ having to be interpreted. What I can say is that the whole "after" discussion is something they have properly addressed in this FAQ, so hopefully it will clear everything up and not leave us in a position where other cards need to be interpreted.

I assume you mean the Shadow Effect on the Wolf Rider. It's one of the many questions that we are waiting for the FAQ [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_minisite_sec.asp?eidm=129&esem=4] to answer.

Can I use my starting hero abilities during setup? For example, can I look at the top card of the encounter deck with Denethor before I flip up the first card in then Anduin river quest? 

Thanks in advance.

I have a question. Can you play events and abilities when you are playing out allies and attachments during the planning phase? Specifically, can you cast Steward of Gondor then immediatly use it to get resources to spend immediately to cast more allies or attachments? Reading the rules I see you can activate Steward immediately before or after you play allies and atachments but it doesn't say you can play abilities during, so I am thinking you won't be able to use it until you are done playing allies and attachments.

Waiting for the official FAQ on this one, the closest we have is that When revealed effects in theory would occur during set up and therefore responses to those effects should also occur during set up, but there's no clarity (yet) on other Hero actions.

Waiting for FAQ, i think it is after the entire attack steps has occurred, so after they have dealt damage, but there is an argument and a school of thought to suggest after means as soon as the shadow card is turned without a shadow effect...

That section in the turn sequence is coloured green which means players can play actions freely during that step, so yes you can play SoG, then immediately exhause it to gain resource then spend that resource on more allies or attachments. I'll add this to the FAQ.

Maggical said:

No, you do not pay the 6 resource cost if you decide to trigger his response.

"After a Dwarf hero you control leaves play, put Brok Ironfist into play from your hand."

Card text over-rides the rulebook (Golden Rule, page 4). Since the card doesn't say "Pay Cost to put Brok..." you do not. Also note that this may be triggered outside Phase 2 Planning (usually the time you get to play Ally cards), since it is a response then you get to play Brok from hand at the trigger point.

BTW, a good pointer for such questions is the following unofficial FAQ [http://www.kaybee.org/kirk/LoTR_LCG_Cards_and_FAQs.pdf] by kirkbauer on BGG [http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/652325/comprehensive-card-reference-faq].

The Only limitation I can find is around Player Declaration.

As long as the Player is limited to only declare ONE attack per Creature per Round, it doesn't really matter how many attacks a certain Character could perform.

But in Legolas case he has the ability to be included in OTHER Players Declarations.



Aaaaand... I was right. New FAQ says so. Just felt like gloating a little. (In all friendliness) :-)

Of course I did not consider the added complicaiton of card text allowing the same player to again declare an attack against the same Enemy, but... in essence the FAQ is quite spot on.

Players are Limited - Characters are not.

 I don't think you ever skip the combat phase, or any phases for that matter.  Sometimes nothing happens in a phase, but the phase still occurs.  The goblin sniper would still damage a character, even if your not engaged with anyone.

## 263 [TheLightdarker on July 8, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45639-unoffical-faq-and-suggested-answers-thread/?do=findComment&comment=496885)

You wouldn't "skip" the combat phase if you aren't engaged with any enemies, as there is nothing in the rules that states to do so.  You play each successive step as you normally would, despite nothing happening and usually having no effects to resolve.  If you think about it, it would be a little silly if, for example, you were unable to attack enemies in the staging area with Dunhere simply because you weren't also engaged with any enemies.

To speed up the tedium of saying "okay, declare attackers step.  There are no eligible attackers," and so on, the players probably say or agree "there are no eligible/possible combats and no effects to resolve, so lets 'skip' to the next phase."  However, the combat phase still happens.  If there are no actual combats, but a special case, such as a Goblin Sniper being in the staging area, its forced effect still triggers as normal.

and FYI to jot your memory:

Goblin Sniper: "Forced: If Goblin Sniper is in the staging area at the end of the combat phase, each player deals 1 point of damage to 1 character he controls."

edit: beaten!  I agree with Kiwina.

I read the KB FAQ and I see that there is a question about Sentinel keyword and the Stand Together card. Now, I was thinking as Sentinel goes, a Sentinel keyword character can defend any attack that is declared as undefended. Therefore only Sentinel keyworded  characters may defend previously declared undefended attacks, but what if at this same time, during this same attack more than one Sentinel keyworded character is available to defend against said attack. If I was to have a Stand Together card in hand at that very  moment, could I group together  a bunch of Sentinel keywords as defenders?

 

What say you, oh high and mighty ones...?

Excuse me if this has been posted before, but has there ever been any kind of official word or consensus on the following rulebook contradiction?

* Under questing phase, somewhere it says that players can take actions at the end of each step.

* On the round/phase overview section in the back (with the green/red highlighting), it says that "players can take actions generally, or at the end of each step as described in the rules" or something like that.

As an example of what I am asking, can I play Sneak Attack during the first step of the quest phase?  I'm talking about the "commit characters to quest" step.  Is it possible to Sneak Attack say, Gandalf, and then commit him to the quest?  Or, do I have to wait until I am done committing characters (and move on to step 2) before I can Sneak Attack Gandalf?

I usually play it where Sneak attack has to be played after characters commit to the quest, but it is a little ambiguous the way the chart in the back presents it.

Look in the rules book. There is good explonation about this. first step of Questing phase : Players commit Characters to the quest.

Since this step is green you can play action and event in any order. So it mean you can commit 1 hero to the quest than play sneak attack or some action an so on. You can play event first than start commit characters to the quest up to you. Even when you commit all your characters to the quest you still can play events and actions. But when you say is done and you go to staiging phase you cannot play any actions and events (excluding responses) until all encounter cards will revealed and resolve , than is again time for action and events.

Look rule book page 27. Green and red zone. You will understand quickly once and for all.

That is where the ambiguity is though.  

Page 18 says you play event cards after each step.  Step 1 is committing characters to the quest.  According to page 18 Sneak Attack can't be played until after all characters are already committed to the quest.

In contrast, page 27 shows step 1 as a green zone.  That implies you can play event cards generally during that step, or at least between each player committing characters to the quest.

 Looks like the latest article answered my question once and for all.

" If you commit Prince Imrahil to a quest, along with a Gandalf (Core Set, 73) played via Sneak Attack..."

I would also take this to imagine that the colored chart in the back of the rulebook would override the "at the end of each step," ruling earlier in the book.  Interesting.

Guys, let's look at the rules, shall we?

Character Cards
Sometimes, game or rules text will refer to “character”
cards. Both heroes and allies are considered to be
“characters.” Card text that says “choose a character”
allows a player to choose either a hero or an ally card
as the target of the effect.

Since objective cards are not mentioned, they are not considered characters,

unless the card text itself says that the card is to be considered a character (golden rule).

The key word here I think is "as an Ally".

All Objective Cards I've seen so far that Joins the players... this Eagle Creature included, have a text that says "join as an Ally."

I interpret this to mean, that ONCE HE JOINS the players he becomes an Ally (and therefore, by definition a Character) BUT NOT BEFORE he joins.

Therefore I would apply the Golden Rule and treat them as Allies for all intents and purpouses.

i agree...i believe the "play at end of step" refers to the red steps, whereas the green steps you can play at any time.

 

 

The reason it says "play at the end of step" is because after every red step, there is a green step.  The only exception being in the Refresh Phase, where 3 red things happen back-to-back.

So, when you play, just follow the chart in the back of the Rulebook.  Play actions at anytime during green steps.  Play only responses during red steps.

The only phases that start with a green block are Planning and Quest.

Well, not anything at anytime. You can play actions during the green steps. Units and Attachments can only be played during the Planning phase though.

Just to expand on this. According to the FAQ, a character can still only make 1 attack against a single enemy (whether he is engaged to it or not) unless a card-effect allows a second attack against it.

Let's say you attack an enemy you are engaged with, then, after your attack resolves, your teammate plays Son of Arnor and engages that same enemy. You cannot participate in an attack against that enemy, because you have declared an attack against it already.

Same thing goes for your teammate. If they participated in an attack against that enemy while you were engaged with it, then used Son of Arnor to engage the enemy, they cannot declare another attack against it.

This is pretty much contradicted by FAQ 1.11.  You can only declare a single attack against a particular enemy.  No limitation on participating.  You've got a Hill Troll engaged with you and you declare an attack against it.  Your friend plays Son of Arnor (with Sneak Attack, say) and engages the Troll.  Can you declare an attack against the Troll with your Ranged characters?  No - you've already declared one.  Can you use your Ranged characters to participate when your friend declares an attack against the Troll?  Absolutely.

 

In the FAQ example, Tom cannot declare an attack against the Hill Troll, but Kris could.

Ahh.  I didn't realize that "declare" only referred to the active player.  Anyone else who attacks isn't "declaring" apparently.

Radiskull, I usually agree with you wholheartedly but, I think I might have to disagree on this one. I believe that characters must be declared as attackers one by one, just as they must be declared as defenders one by one.

 

 

Take stand together as an example, Action: Choose a player. That player may declare any number of his eligible characters as defenders against each enemy attacking him this phase. That player may declare any number...yada yada, so on. It seems to me that any declarations must be done individually and to every action. Therefore, I believe that a participating character must be declared as an attacker or defender.

But this doesn't contradict anything Radiskull has said.

The important points in the FAQ are this:

The active player is limited to one attack declaration against each eligible enemy.

Characters are not limited to the number of attacks they can make provided each attack can be legally declared

 

In sWhiteboy's example, the active player is the player who has just played SoA. All other players aren't active (at that time) and therefore all of their eligible characters could participate in that attack, even if they had attacked that same enemy previously.

Card effects can override even these basic principles, obviously, but even without a special card effect, the above stands.

 pumpkin's clarification is exactly what I meant.  I see it happening like this:

 

1) Player A declares an attack against enemy X.

2) Player A exhausts some attackers and Player B maybe exhausts some Ranged to help out.

3) All those characters are readied for some reason.

4) Player B declares an attack against enemy X.

5) Player B exhausts some attackers and Player A exhausts some Ranged to help out.

 

Now, even if the attackers in step 2 and in step 5 are EXACTLY the same characters, this is legal.  What would not be legal is if player A OR player B declared an attack against enemy X again.

Well then in fact in your theorem enemy x in step 1 and 4 should be separate variables because in fact they are separate enemies.

 

Therefore, in the end what you are saying is that a single enemy may not be declared as a defender more than once (sans card effects) but a single character may attack as many times (against different enemies) as desired as long as they are readied first?

no ,radiskull is saying that it can be the same enemy (given it survives the first attack) that both players attack with the same characters because the "declaring of attacks" is done once by each player.

## 302 [Bonus Card on September 6, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45639-unoffical-faq-and-suggested-answers-thread/?do=findComment&comment=524660)

Ok, in all honesty I hope to play the way that has been stated by Radiskull, I like the mechanic and the playability of this ability with coenciding cards. My only hang up is in the interpretation of the rules that state

 

1. After a players first attack has resolved, he can declare another attack against any eligible enemy target that he has not yet attacked this round.

 

2. A character with the ranged keyword can be declared by its controller as an attacker against enemies that are engaged with other player. A character can declare ranged attacks against these targets while its owner is declaring attacks, or it can participate in attacks that are declared by other players.

 

Now the use of participate in the second clause of part two seems to for all purposes to differentiate participating from declare, however because of the use of declare in the preceding clause, I cannot decide indefinitely that this is correct.

 

Because of this I may be hesitant, until a new revision to the FAQs is printed, to play it this way. It would make playing less of a challenge, but if the new FAQs came out and this playing method turned out to be wrong I would feel somewhat cheated by the games that I won prior to the printing.

 

However, if this is true, it would make any card that readied allies turn into a double shot for ranged attackers. And that would be awesome.

 The key difference is between players declaring attacks and characters being declared as attackers.  A character who participates in an attack is also being declared as an attacker, regardless of who controls them.  (I believe that "being declared as an attacker" leads to "participating in an attack".)

 

FAQ (1.11) is instructive here: "Characters are not limited as to how many times they can participate in attacks against the same enemy, provided each attack can be legally declared, and the character is ready and eligible to be declared as an attacker."

 

So, from this, it seems clear that participating and being declared as an attacker are the same thing.  FAQ 1.11 very explicitly restricts the number of attacks a player declares against an enemy to 1 per round.  But that's all.

My understanding of "ready and eligible" is this:

Ready-The character is not exhausted, they are in the ready position.

Eligible-The enemy is within the character's range.  This normally means the enemy is engaged with the player controlling the character, but characters with the Ranged keyword may be declared as an attacker against enemies who are engaged with other players as well.  Dunhere is another exception since he may be declared as an attacker against enemies in the staging area.

 

Legally declaring an attack is explained pretty well in the FAQ:

(1.11) Limitations on Attacks
When a player is the active attacker during the combat phase, the game rules grant him the option to declare 1 attack against each enemy with which he is engaged. If, through card effects such as ranged, a player is able to declare attacks against enemies with which he is not engaged, he is still only permitted a single attack against each of these enemies.

 Whether an attack is legally declared depends on who the active player is.  If the active player has already declared an attack against a particular enemy, another one against the same enemy can't be declared until the active player changes.  It really does come down to "who started it".

Just to complicate matters I would like to add that the above is only true as long as a card doesn't allow Active Player to declare an attack. If such a card comes along he can use it to declare a second attack against the same Enemy again. It is only the "free" or "inherent" declaration that is limited to once per enemy per player. Card effects that allow extra Declarations can be used without this limitation.

Example: "Quick Strike"

Hi all,

I still have two questions for which I don't know the answer. I hope they're not answered elsewhere, in which case I apologize.

First: if Bilbo is Sacked!, is the starting player allowed to make a second draw? First I thought no, but then I read rules page 23 again ("Constant Effects have no bold trigger"). I think Bilbo's ability is a constant effect. Thus a sacked Bilbo would still allow you to draw another card. Do you think this is correct?

 

Second: I didn't really understand how Radagasts playing-creature-ability works. I can think of those two options:
a.) Radagst allows you to play creatures, because his ressource tokens override the ressource matching rule on p. 12 of the rulebook. So creature cards can be bought with Radagast's still sphere-less ressource tokens.
b.) Radagast allows you to play creature cards, because his tokens adapt to the required sphere. E.g. Radagast can pay a Winged Guardian because the 2 ressource tokens become tactics ressource tokens. (This does not mean that Radagast is a tactics hero or that his ressources are tactics ressources all the time - they're only converted right in that moment when he's using his special ability).

The text on Radagast doesn't specify the details further, so both options could be possible. Option a.) is the straight-forward one, I play it like this and it also seems to be the conclusion of the people of this thread: http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=540519 [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=540519] Yet in that thread I found no arguments against option b.) (I agree with that thread's opinion that a 0-cost tactics creature card requires a tactics hero, but that's not what I'm asking myself.)
While further thinking about option b.), it has the advantage that there is no need for the Golden Rule (overriding rules by card texts). Referring to the FAQ rule 1.00 about the Golden Rule: "If it is possible to observe both card text and the text of the rulebook, both are observed." With option b.), no rule is overridden. So this would be preferable?? What dou you think?

Note that this actually makes a difference, when The East Bank is the active location ("ally cards cost 1 additional matching resource to play from hand"). With interpretation b.), Radagast can play Winged Guardian when he has 3 ressource tokens on him; with interpretation a.), 2 ressource tokens can come from Radagast but the 3rd one has to be from a tactics hero, which is not good, because of the Old Wive's Tales.

Regards,
Pete

I agree with your interpretation re: Bilbo.  I think that since his ability is a constant effect, it'll still provide an extra card while sacked.

 

As for Radagast, I think that choice (a) is correct.  I think (b) is not correct just because there is no support for the idea on the text of the cards.  The only "ability" Radagast's resources are imparted by his text is the ability to ignore resource match.  (This is easily the kind of thing I could see being changed via errata/clarification, but for now, I'd go with choice a.)

 I would like to second Radiskull.

In regards to Radagast, I do believe (a) is more correct, and that Radagast's "Resource Match" is tied to a trait instead of a sphere.  However, using that logic, I also think you could pay three resources from Radagast to play a Winged Guardian while The East Bank is active.

## 315 [HilariousPete on September 21, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45639-unoffical-faq-and-suggested-answers-thread/?do=findComment&comment=530982)

Thanks for your answers!

@radiskull: Someone could argue, that Radagasts card text also doesn't tell anything about overriding the ressource match rule - but then, Radagast could only pay for neutral creature cards, which obviously is not how Radagast is meant to function. But I get your point: option (a) needs less text added to Radagast than option (b), which adds "more" complex ideas to it. So I'll stick with option (a) because of this argument. And hopefully the next official FAQ will clear things up!

@Kiwina: I don't know if I got your idea right - you mean, Radagast does produce "creature-matching" ressource tokens instead of overriding the ressource match rule and instead of producing tactics ressources? Hm, that is a new variant of option (b), I think. Again, this would "add more ideas" to Radagast than option (a), so I'll play with (a). But interesting thought, thx for sharing!

 yes, very unclear, but... in re: Bilbo I second you all :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] because Sacked is NOT THE SAME as being taken prisoner in Dol Guldur! so his effect still affects the game...

 

in re: East Banks... I'd probably say that Radagast can summon creatures regardless of sphere, and can therefore summon guardians for the 3... even with east banks...

 I'm copy-pasting something from another thread - Woz asked Nate about Radagast:

Regarding Radagast and his ability to pay for creatures if you don't have a hero of their sphere, I sent an email to FFG and received this response from Nate French.

"Yes. Radagast's ability allows his resources to pay for Creatures
without a resource match. (Since he has no sphere icon, he'll never
have a match.) There is no need to have a hero with the same icon as a
Creature being payed for with Radagast's resources."

I also read Nate's answer, but sadly it doesn't answer the East Banks question: "Since he has no sphere icon, he'll never have a match" is for option (a), "There is no need to have a hero with the same icon as a Creature being payed for" is for option (b)...

I received Nate's response today (wow, really fast!). Here is the text of my question:

Hi, I've got a rules question which I can't answer. I also posted it in the forums, but there seems to be no general consensus.
The question is: Can creature cards be played by Radagast's resources, because he is implicitly overriding the resource match rule, or because his resources are transformed to matching resources at the moment he is using his ability? (I can reformulate the question with an example: if I want to play a Winged Guardian with Radagast and The East Bank is the active location, can all 3 resource tokens come from Radagast's pool; or only 2, and the 3rd has to be from a tactics hero's pool?)

Thanks very much in advance,
kind regards,
Manuel


Nate's response was:

Manuel,

There is nothing in Radagast's effect that is transforming the resources to create a match, his text is simply "overriding" the need for the resources he spends to matchthe sphere of a Creature.

So, to play a Creature, you could pay the entire cost from Radagast, or you could pay part of the cost from Radagast and part from a hero with a matching resource icon.

You could not pay part of the cost from Radagast and part of the cost from a non-matching hero.

So it's for option (a). Nate didn't mention the East Banks specifically, but I think it's clear that you have to have at least one matching resource not coming from Radagast, because Radagast isn't producing matching resources.

I think he was specifically responding to the East Banks here. Radagast overrides the resource matching rule and thus he can pay for the full cost (including East Banks). This makes perfect sense to me.

I'm with Svenn here - East Bank increases the cost of an ally by one, it doesn't require that you pay a resource to play an ally.  It's a very subtle difference, but an important one.  Winged Guardian costs 3 while EB is in play, and Radagast can pay that.  If East Bank said "While EB is the active location, pay 1 matching resource to play an ally from your hand", then the cost would be "paid to" the location, and Radagast couldn't pay for it.

IMO, it's a very subtle difference, but an important one.

Ah, yeah, now I get it - the East Bank is increasing the cost up to 3, and then Radagast can pay because of his resource match override of the whole costs - now just 3 instead of 2. Yes, that's really an important difference which I didn't notice until now. Thx!

THIS

So that is that cleared up but currently in the FAQ we had the statement that Radagast can't put 0 cost creatures into play, because he doesn't override the need for a matching sphere icon to play the card - I'm so so about this, but everyone else still thinks it stands?

 I still believe Radagast can't put 0 cost creatures into play, since his resources aren't being used.  Perversely, Radagast could put a 0-cost creature into play if its cost were made 1 by East Bank. lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif]

Yes, and its this perversion that makes me think it simply isn't right, but I guess its something for FFG to clarify. Is there a similar precedent/ruling in other LCGs we could use?

If Player 1 has a character with ranged and declares an attack against an enemy engaged with Player 2 and Player 2 has characters that are ready, can Player 2 have her characters participate in the attack declared by Player 1?  I have played that they can, since the enemy is something Player 2's characters could attack already.

I don't think it works that way. The rules don't support it. The rules for combat say nothing about the non-active player participating in an attack normally. Characters with Ranged have a special rule that allows them to participate when an attack is declared by another player.

I would say that if you are declaring attacks against enemies engaged with another player via Ranged, that player cannot interact. There is nothing in the rules to support this.

 pumpkin's clarification is exactly what I meant.  I see it happening like this:

 

1) Player A declares an attack against enemy X.

2) Player A exhausts some attackers and Player B maybe exhausts some Ranged to help out.

3) All those characters are readied for some reason.

4) Player B declares an attack against enemy X.

5) Player B exhausts some attackers and Player A exhausts some Ranged to help out.

 

Now, even if the attackers in step 2 and in step 5 are EXACTLY the same characters, this is legal.  What would not be legal is if player A OR player B declared an attack against enemy X again.



And sorry to have jumped on this so late, and I do not feel like digging this up off the new FAQ, is the deal so that every player can declare an attack against an enemy once? Or players can only declare only one attack against each enemy?

No, I don't think radiskull was kidding. Radagast's ability allows you to override the resource match rule (via the golden rule), when you pay for a card. But if you have a 0 cost card, you don't pay anything, and therefor you don't use Radagast's ability. So the rule on p. 12 is in effect: "Cards with a cost of zero do not require a resource to be spent in order to pay their cost, but they do require at least one hero under that player’s control to have a resource icon that matches the card’s sphere". (I hope I'm recalling radiskull's arguments properly, but the arguments above make sense, at least to me.)

 

This is very odd (why can't Radagast gather a 0-cost creature ally when he is capable of gathering a 5-cost Landroval?), so I think if we ask we get an explanation/errata. But currently there is no 0 cost creature card ;-) so nothing to worry.

I believe when the cost is 0, you do pay it nonetheless. X is the cost and there is not difference between 0 and 1, as far as the logic and mechanics go.

And thanks a lot for the link!

You do "pay a cost" of 0 when putting a 0-cost ally into play, but you're not using Radagast's resources to do so.  This, I think, is the crucial difference.

And no, I wasn't kidding about the East Bank thing.

You should try to read the FAQ.  It answers this question very clearly.  (Honestly, the two options you provided seem identical to me.)

 

Ok, so since I love answering questions, I'll give you this one - each player may declare an attack against a particular enemy one time.  In a 2-player game, this means that every enemy may be attacked at most twice.  FAQ 1.11:  "When a player is the active attacker during the combat phase, the game rules grant him the option to declare 1 attack against each enemy with which he is engaged."

 

But seriously - read the FAQ.  You're basically saying "I don't wanna do the work to figure this out, can someone else do that same work for me and get back to me?"

Sorry if I have taken your valuable time

But wow! there has been like a ton of questions that could be easily answered by reading something somewhere. As I did not have access to the FAQ I asked since I thought it seemed the answer has been known around.

Has it really offended you, or the previous post about kidding has? Because I did not mean to and I understand you're not being childish here.

And by the way, you can be using Radagast's 0 resources.

I agree and playing Kiwina's way does have a significant game changing effect.

Based on the way combat is described in the rules, it is clear without the use of a card or ability that enemies engaged with players attack before that player.

Now consider player A (first player), player B and player C.

If player A has a ranged character he can declare an attack on an enemy engaged with player B, as part of that attack if player C has a ranged character he could also participate, this is fully supported by the rules.

If player B could also attack at that time, then it would grant player B the advantage of being able to attack his engaged enemies before they have attacked him. Not only is this not supported by the rules, it also directly conflicts with the standard way in which combat is defined.

I see the combat structure as a way of replicating initiative in an RPG, and "melee" heroes and allies basically always lose initiative against engaged enemies, unless a specific card or ability (quickstrike) overrides it.

Ranged characters have the ability to gain the inititative in some cases, but that only allows them to gain initiative for themselves not other heroes/allies (such has those controlled by player B).

Interestingly, if player B had a ranged character, i think it could participate in the attack of player A, even against an enemy engaged with player B.

I don't think combat works this way. Here's how I play it. Let player A be the first player:

All enemies get dealt shadow cards. Then the player A has to fend off the attacks of enemies that are engaged with him, resolving shadow cards, etc. If he's done, player B defends against "his" enemies, and then player C.

Only when all enemy attacks are finished, player A starts his attacks (perhaps on an enemy engaged with B, if he's using a ranged character, and B may join with his ranged characters). After A finished all his attacks, player B attacks (could be the same enemy, but now also non-ranged may attack. If A readied his ranged character somehow, he could also participate in this attack). And then it's player C's turn to attack the enemies. Then combat is finished.

So the ranged attack / ranged participate doesn't grant you the option of taken initiative before your enemies. But if you somehow are able to ready characters between the attacks, a single (ranged) character can attack the same enemy twice (or theoretically thrice, because here we have 3 players).

Yer, you are right, I got my ideas wrong around combat - I mostly play solo so ranged combat doesn't normally even come into my games and I was sleepy this morning when I replied and for some reason got it in my head that each player when through the entire combat phase before moving onto the next player! sonrojado.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sonrojado.gif]

The original point still stands though, there is no support for melee characters being able to participate in attacks made by the player of ranged characters, only ranged characters are able to participate in attacks declared by other players.

Now, if player A played quickstrike to use his ranged character to attack an enemy engaged with player B, before any enemies have attacked, i think the above still applies, any ranged characters controlled by player B and C could also particpiate in the attack (as the ranged keyword doesn't seem to restict participation in attacks only to those attacks made during the players phase of combat..) - what do you think?

I agree to both points.

To the first point, Svenn and you already said it - nothing in the rules suggest that non-ranged characters can join an attack of another player (even if the target is an enemy engaged with you).

To the second issue: This is pretty difficult, you can interpret it in both ways. I would want to answer "no", and I even prepared some arguments for it, but then I found out that this case has already been covered by the official FAQ, the example after rule 1.11, which says "yes" (because Legolas is allowed to join the attack with Quick Strike, again).

I think this is odd in some way, because why would Legolas be allowed to join the attack with Quick Strike again? The logic/the answer might have been "because he has ranged and therefor is an eligible attacker". Ok, and now suppose Tom had another ally under control, e.g. Beorn: could he also have joined the Quick Strike? Because he also is an eligible attacker too, because the Hill Troll is enganged with Tom.
Following this logic, when you play Quick Strike, can you declare all your characters as attackers, as long as they are legal attackers? I'd like to say no, but the example in 1.11 tells otherwise... So I play it as the FAQ tells ;-) Of course this makes Quick Strike even better than I thought of it before.

What do you and others think? Does Quick Strike allow all eligible attackers to attack? Or am I interpreting too much into the example 1.11?

## 348 [pumpkin on October 8, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45639-unoffical-faq-and-suggested-answers-thread/?do=findComment&comment=538844)

A character can participate in an attack instigated by using quickstrike if a rule states that they are eligible to join (such as ranged) but quickstrike in and of itself does not make them eligible.

So if quickstrike is played during the quest phase by player A, for example, then ranged characters controlled by other players could participate in that attack, as ranged clearly states that ranged keyword allows you to participate in attacks declared by other players (and makes no mention of limiting this to a certain phase).

Other characters controlled by player A could not join in however, as the only time players are allowed to declare multple attackers (without the golden rule coming into play) is during the players attack phase of the combat phase.

Even if quickstrike is played, as in the FAQ example (later in the player's attack phase) because this attack is instigated via quickstrike and isn't player A's "regular" attack against that enemy, player A can't use more than one character in the quick strike attack, IMO.

So in summary, quickstrike doesn't say declare eligible attackers, it says declare a character (singular). To participate in that attack, another charatcer must have a specific card, ability or keyword that allows them to do so.

I reckon anyway!

Ah, I see. "Ranged" is this specific keyword, it is an abbreviation for the card text "Can participate in other player's attack(s) and ...", so this is in effect and ranged characters can join this QuickStrike-attack. But not normal characters, since they only are allowed to participate in regular attacks in combat phase by the standard rules (and without this rule they wouldn't participate at all).

Yeah, those arguments of you sound good :-)

Ok, two (hopefully) last questions: If a player A uses Quick Strike on e.g. his Aragorn and on an enemy he is engaged with, can his Silverlode Archers (ranged) join? I'd say no, because the keyword "ranged" always talks about participating in attacks against enemies of other players on p.24, and not against your enemies. Right? And if player A supposedly had 2 Silverlode Archers and he played Quick Strike on an enemy engaged with player B and on A's 1st Archer, then A's 2nd Archer could join, right?

Other characters controlled by player A could not join in however, as the only time players are allowed to declare multple attackers (without the golden rule coming into play) is during the players attack phase of the combat phase.

...

So in summary, quickstrike doesn't say declare eligible attackers, it says declare a character (singular). To participate in that attack, another charatcer must have a specific card, ability or keyword that allows them to do so.

 

Ah, I see. "Ranged" is this specific keyword, it is an abbreviation for the card text "Can participate in other player's attack(s) and ...", so this is in effect and ranged characters can join this QuickStrike-attack. But not normal characters, since they only are allowed to participate in regular attacks in combat phase by the standard rules (and without this rule they wouldn't participate at all).

 

Yeah, those arguments of you sound good :-)

Ok, two (hopefully) last questions: If a player A uses Quick Strike on e.g. his Aragorn and on an enemy he is engaged with, can his Silverlode Archers (ranged) join? I'd say no, because the keyword "ranged" always talks about participating in attacks against enemies of other players on p.24, and not against your enemies. Right? And if player A supposedly had 2 Silverlode Archers and he played Quick Strike on an enemy engaged with player B and on A's 1st Archer, then A's 2nd Archer could join, right?

 

 

I agree on the first point, ranged attacks occur against enemies engaged with other players, so they can't join Aragorn in that instance.

For the second question though, if player A is using quick strike (and hence the one declaring the attack) then I'm not sure his 2nd archer can also participate - ranged allows you to participate in attacks declared by other players and quick strike itself allows a single character to declare an attack out of phase, so I'm not sure there is a ruling that supports the 2nd silverlode archer being able to join in.

Conversely if player B played quickstrike, then both of player A's archers could join in, in those circumstances, and if Player A attacked as part of the regular player's attack phase, then i think both his archers could attack then, just not when using quickstrike.

Hm, I read the paragraph on "ranged" again, and don't think this is true, here the important sentence:

 

"A character with the ranged keyword can be declared by its controller as an attacker against enemies that are engaged with other players."

So a ranged attack isn't restricted to attacks of other players, it is only ristricted to attacks against enemies engaged with another player. That's a small, but important difference. (If it were restriced to attacks of companion players, there is a strange situation even without Quick Strike: You could initiate a normal ranged attack with your 1st Archer but then you couldn't participate with your 2nd ranged character - because it is your attack. And I think it should be possible for 2 Archers to work together and hit an enemy which is dealing with the characters of another player. The new Legolas+Brand combo does use this mechanic too, doesn't it?)

Regarding your "Conversely..." exaample, I fully agree to it

Sorry, I didn't make myself clear on that middle point - you are right ranged isn't restricted to participating in attacks by other players, but I wasn't saying that's the only time a ranged character can attack, but that is the only time the ranged keyword (in and of itself) allows that character to attack out of phase.

So player A is using quick strike to allow one of his archers to attack out of phase, as that is what the card does - one character singular.

His other ranged character can't attack out of phase and participate in the attack just by using the ranged keyword, because the ranged keyword only allows attacking out of phase when participating in the attacks of other players. Player C could participate in that attack with a ranged character, because the ranged keyword all by itself is enough to allow player C to participate in player A's attack.

make more sense?

Makes sense, but I'm not convinced yet ;-)

You say that ranged allows participating an attack of another player out-of-phase (I think you are referring to the "or it [the character] can participate in attacks that are declared by other players"-part of the rules here), and you say that ranged characters can't participate in out-of-phase attacks of your own, if I got you right. And here's where I cant find the reference for - the appropriate part of the rules reads "A character can declare ranged attacks against these targets while its owner is declaring attacks". If I'm player A and playing Quick Strike on an enemy engaged with B in e.g. resource phase, I'm declaring an attack, and while I'm doing this, I can declare another ranged participant. The rule doesn't go like "A character can declare ranged attacks against these targets while its owner is in phase 6 step 1 of combat resolution against enemies"...

Yep, you are right - I was seeing that as representing phase 6 blah, blah, but the way it is written in the rules, its clearly not restricted to that.

Interesting, ranged keyword is pretty powerful ain't it!

yes, but what do you mean by ANOTHER ranged participant? quick strike would only allow you to declare e.g. legolas as an attacker against player B's enemy, e.g. in the resource phase! so legolas would be the sole attacker - but that's what you meant, right? if so, this is a correct interpretation of the rules!

I dind't mean only Legolas attacking. By another character I meant a 2nd Silverlode Archer, or any other ranged character I have under control and which is ready. Quick Strike states to make an attack with 1 character, but with special effects, other characters (namely characters with the ranged ability in our discussion) can participate in the attack (you can see this in the example 1.11 in the FAQ). The discussion was about how and why Quick Strike would allow for this - under which conditions ranged characters can participate, and under which they cannot.

The argument goes like this....

Yes, quick strike allows Legolas to attack an enemy engaged with player B (in the resource phase, for example) but if I also have a silverlode archer, then as I am declaring an attack using Legolas and quickstrike and Silverlode has the ranged keyword, then the archer should also be able to declare (adding his attack to Legolas') an attack against the same enemy, at that time.

 ok, then I understood Pete correctly - this CAN'T be true! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] I'd love it, but the rules don't seem to support this.

you declare attackers during the combat phase (p.20 rulebook) - there, you can declare as many attackers as you want

quick strike on the other hand allows you to attack with ONE character - you have to exhaust it. though I have to admit, that the "ranged" keyword says - "while its owner is declaring attacks" (p. 24), this is in reference to the combat phase, imo... during the "declaration" step of the combat phase...

allowing this would consequently mean, that for ONE tactics resource, also OTHER players' ranged characters could attack (read p.24), because they can participate in attacks that are declared by other players, out of phase... I don't think so...

In the FAQ Aragorn uses quickstrike and Legolas uses he ranged keyword to participate in said attack.

What happens after I declare Gondorian Spearman as a defender and before damage (let's say after the Resolve Shadow Effect step), and I activate Born Aloft's ability to return him to my hand? My Spearman would survive, but is the attack still considered defended? Or does it become undefended?

2. carrock: "immune" to player card effects - this means power in the earth, radagast's cunning, etc but this also affect lorien guide and northern tracker? I'd say yes! so there are no progress tokens placed on the carrock other through "genuine" progress?

Wow, exactly!

your ranged characters can't participate in Aragon's quick strike though as ranged characters (when using ranged keyword) can only attack enemies engaged with other players.

If you used quickstrike and Legolas though, then your ranged characters could participate, as could ranged characters of other players, except the one engaged with the enemy you are quick striking!

As for Carrock, as part of set up, you put it into staging and there is no way to get rid of it until you travel to it after getting 7th progress, so it will always be in staging.

Player effects include tracker and guide, aye, as that is the way (immune to player effects) the game prevents you from getting rid of carrock out of staging by any method other than travelling to it once you have 7th progress...

and ok, now that I think about it, it does sound logical... like a VOLLEY of "quickstrike" arrows... this can be devastating in 4-player games - for the bad guys, i.e.... :-)

Why can't the player who is engaged with the quick strike target declare his Ranged characters as participants?  Based on your discussion on the last page any time a Ranged character declares a ranged attack, any other ranged characters can participate.  There would be no exception, because the rules contain no exception.  The player that is engaged with the quick strike target would just be participating in an attack declared by another player, which Ranged characters can do.

The Ranged keyword applies specifically to enemies engaged with another player. You cannot use the Ranged keyword to attack an enemy that you are engaged with.

The ranged keyword doesn't specify that you can only participate in an attack declared by another player if the target is not engaged with you.  It simply says a ranged character may participate in attacks declared by other players.  Ranged doesn't turn on and off.  It's a constant effect.  In Pumpkins scenario Player 1 has Legolas and some other ranged characters. Player 2 is engaged with some enemy and also has ranged characters.  Player 3 likewise has ranged characters.  Player 1 declares a ranged attack (meaning the target isn't engaged with Player 1) against the enemy engaged with Player 2 during the resource phase by way of Quick Strike.  Because it's a ranged attack the other Ranged characters controlled by Player 1 may participate in the attack. (I'm not sure if I agree with this.)  Because Player 1 declared an attack, the Ranged characters controlled by Player 3 may also participate in the attack, so what disqualifies the Ranged characters controlled by Player 2 to participate?  An attack was declared by another player, so Player 2's Ranged characters should be able to participate just like Player 3's characters are.  The rules say nothing about participation being affected by who the target is engaged with, just who is declaring the attack (other players) and the kind of attack (ranged only).  Only one of those conditions must be met, not both.

Yes, I fear it does so, see rules p. 24:

"A character with the ranged keyword can be declared by its controller as an attacker against enemies that are engaged with other players."

It doesn't matter who declared the attack, but it matters with whom the target enemy is engaged with. In the example, the target is engaged with player 2, so ranged characters of player 2 cannot participate in the attack, because the enemy is engaged with him, and not with another player. This is the reason that disqualifies them

Okay, I can see that, but that says they can be, not that they must be.  They are allowed to participate in attacks declared by other players.  If the participation of a ranged character was limited to only being with enemies engaged with other players why would the rules not say something like: "A character with the ranged keyword can be declared by its controller as an attacker against enemies that are engaged with other players. A character can declare ranged attacks against these targets while its owner is declaring attacks, or it can participate in attacks against these targets that are declared by other players. In either case, the character must exhaust and meet any other requirements necessary to make the attack."

It's no different from saying that all ranged characters you control can help Legolas with a ranged-attack Quick Strike because the the rules don't specifying which phase the attacks are being declared in.

It is very different. The rules specifically state, as you selectively skip over every time, that the ranged keyword applies to attacks made against characters engaged with another player. It says "can" and not "must" because it is overriding the basic targets rule but does not replace the original options. If it said "must" then that character would never be able to attack an enemy engaged with them, only engaged with other characters.

The "can" allows you to use the ranged keyword to target an enemy engaged with another player. That's the requirement for a ranged attack. An attack against enemies engaged with you does not count as a ranged attack, because the ranged rules do not allow you to make a ranged attack against characters you are engaged with. The part you keep selectively reading ("or it can participate in attacks that are declared by other players") is still bound by the basics of the ranged keyword (can attack enemies engaged with other players).

I'v just seen that Svenn already answered for it, but I'll post my prepared answere here too, perhaps my arguments are of any help. My original post has been:


Ah, I think I can see what you mean now.

First, to the can/must issue: If something isn't given by the rules, it's not allowed. E.g. you can't do an attack in your resource phase, just because you have a ready character and the rules don't forbid it. It has to be allowed by the rules when you can do something, not the other way.

To the missing "against these targets" in the second clause: That's a point, right. But I have 2 arguments against it. First, I think that FFG only omitted it because of lingual simplicity. Ok, this argument is weak, I know... but here's the other argument: Even when a character participates in an attack, he has to be declared as an attacker. (He's just not the first attacker, that's all.) You can see this on page 20, step 1 of combat resolution: All characters are declared as an attacker, when they attack together. So it's necessary for our ranged characters to be declared as an attacker, too. And are they allowed to be declared as an attacker? Here the first sentence of p. 24 is again important: they may be declared, but only when the attack is against an enemy which is engaged with another player. But this isn't the case, so they can't be declared as attacker, and therefor can't participate in the combat.

 It is very different. The rules specifically state, as you selectively skip over every time, that the ranged keyword applies to attacks made against characters engaged with another player. It says "can" and not "must" because it is overriding the basic targets rule but does not replace the original options. If it said "must" then that character would never be able to attack an enemy engaged with them, only engaged with other characters.

The "can" allows you to use the ranged keyword to target an enemy engaged with another player. That's the requirement for a ranged attack.

 

 

HilariousPete said:


First, to the can/must issue: If something isn't given by the rules, it's not allowed. E.g. you can't do an attack in your resource phase, just because you have a ready character and the rules don't forbid it. It has to be allowed by the rules when you can do something, not the other way.

 

 

 

I understand the purpose of using can vs. must.  What I was trying to say was the first sentence of the ranged keyword adds eligible targets for that character to attack, not limiting it to only enemies engaged with another player.  We all agree with that, as long as the ranged character is initiating the attack.

The "can" allows you to use the ranged keyword to target an enemy engaged with another player. That's the requirement for a ranged attack. An attack against enemies engaged with you does not count as a ranged attack, because the ranged rules do not allow you to make a ranged attack against characters you are engaged with. The part you keep selectively reading ("or it can participate in attacks that are declared by other players") is still bound by the basics of the ranged keyword (can attack enemies engaged with other players).

 

 

HilariousPete said:


To the missing "against these targets" in the second clause: That's a point, right. But I have 2 arguments against it. First, I think that FFG only omitted it because of lingual simplicity. Ok, this argument is weak, I know... but here's the other argument: Even when a character participates in an attack, he has to be declared as an attacker. (He's just not the first attacker, that's all.) You can see this on page 20, step 1 of combat resolution: All characters are declared as an attacker, when they attack together. So it's necessary for our ranged characters to be declared as an attacker, too. And are they allowed to be declared as an attacker? Here the first sentence of p. 24 is again important: they may be declared, but only when the attack is against an enemy which is engaged with another player. But this isn't the case, so they can't be declared as attacker, and therefor can't participate in the combat.

 

 

 

Lingual simplicity - I have thought of that, espescially given Nate French's stance on Stand and Fight.

The first sentence (that I selectively skip over) - "A character with the ranged keyword can be declared by its controller as an attacker against enemies that are engaged with other players."  My translation: "If I have a character with the ranged keyword I can declare that character as an attacker against the Misty Mountain Goblins engaged with me, or I can declare that character as an attacker against the Dol Guldur Orcs that are engaged with my friend."  I'm pretty sure we all agree on that.  I don't think I'm misreading it either.  Our disagreement revolves less around the first sentence and more around its implications on the second sentence.

Now we get into the semantics. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

This is how I look at the first sentence affecting the second one.

Second sentence - "A character can declare ranged attacks against these targets while its owner is declaring attacks, or it can participate in attacks that are declared by other players."  This is two independent clauses joined by a conjunction.  I'm going to look at each clause alone, and address the conjuntion.

"A character can declare ranged attacks against these targets while its owner is declaring attacks."  My translation: "While I am declaring attacks, I can use my character(s) with the ranged keyword to declare an attack against the Dol Guldur Orcs that are engaged with my friend."  This translation is based on "these targets" referring to the "enemies that are engaged with another player."

"or": Ah, here's the conjunction.  My translation: "What comes next is an alternate choice that is different from the first one."

"It can participate in attacks that are declared by other players."  My translation: "My character with the ranged keyword can be declared as an attacker against an enemy my friend just declared as the target of an attack."  This translation is based on "it" referring to my character with the ranged keyword.  My understanding of your argument is that I need to amend this interpretation to specify that it only works if my friend is attacking an enemy that is not engaged with me.  While that may be the intent of the creators, that is not how it's written.

Third sentence (so I don't skip anything else) - "In either case, the character must exhaust and meet any other requirements necessary to make the attack."  My translation: "If I want to use either of the before mentioned options in the second sentence, my character with the ranged keyword must be ready and he must be able to be declared as an attacker against the chosen enemy."  So far the only "other requirements" would be not having Gandalf's Map attached, and the targeted enemy is not in the staging area, since ranged won't allow me to attack enemies in the staging area.  There may come a time where you have to pay a resource or raise your threat to attack.  In that case those would also become "other requirements" that must be met.

All together (in case you want to skip the specifics):

"A character with the ranged keyword can be declared by its controller as an attacker against enemies that are engaged with other players. A character can declare ranged attacks against these targets while its owner is declaring attacks, or it can participate in attacks that are declared by other players. In either case, the character must exhaust and meet any other requirements necessary to make the attack."

My translation: "If I have a character with the ranged keyword I can declare that character as an attacker against the Misty Mountain Goblins engaged with me, or I can declare that character as an attacker against the Dol Guldur Orcs that are engaged with my friend.  While I am declaring attacks, I can use my character with the ranged keyword to declare an attack against the Dol Guldur Orcs that are engaged with my friend.  What comes next is an alternate choice that is different from the first one.  My character with the ranged keyword can be declared as an attacker against an enemy my friend just declared as the target of an attack.  If I want to use either of the before mentioned options in the second sentence, my character with the ranged keyword must be ready and he must be able to be declared as an attacker against the chosen enemy."

I don't think keywords turn on and off.  Given the example above, I'm going to say the ranged character I have is the Silverlode Archer.  If I attack the Misty Mountain Goblins engaged with me, and I declare my Silverlode Archer as one of the attackers is my Silverlode Archer no longer a ranged character?  I argue that no matter who the Silverlode Archer attacks, he is always a ranged character reaping the benefits of being a ranged character whether he uses the benefits or not.  On a more basic level, if my archer attacks the Misty Mountain Goblins, he shoots them with an arrow.  If he attack the Dol Guldur Orcs, he shoots them with an arrow.

Your main arguments against me are in reference to the term "ranged attack" which isn't even used until the second sentence and is never used again in any part of the game.  I don't know of a single card or document that ever uses the term "ranged attack" other than that one sentence.  It could be an official game term that has yet to be affected by cards, but it might not.  We don't know.  Never again does the game divide attacks into types of attacks, you just declare attacks.  Dunhere doesn't make a staging attack, but he can target enemies in the staging area when he attacks alone.  That text is active unconditionally.  I don't see why the keywords Sentinel and Ranged are different.  They don't contain the words Action:, Resoinse:, or Forced: before them.  They should be active as long as the card is in play.

I apologize if this comes across as an attack.  It's not meant to be one.  I'm just trying to write what is going through my head when I read and interpret the ranged keyword.  At this point, for me, this debate is not about whether my interpretation of the Ranged paragraph is right, but that it isn't a wonky misreading of the paragraph.  With all due respect, your interpretation is probably the one the creators meant to have, but when I read it, I understand it differently than you do.

 When stage 2B of Conflict at the Carrock is revealed (when you start that stage), you place all four Trolls into the staging area, not just one.

Well, I feel like we're going in circles now. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] I understand what you are saying. Yes, they did not specify in that half of the sentence that the targets must be engaged with another player.

Let's try this... Here's another similar set of sentences.

We can go get ice cream. We can go get some ice cream at Friendly's, or we can go to Dairy Queen.

Same sentence structure. What are you going to Dairy Queen for? That was established in the first sentence... for ice cream. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] You don't need to include the "ice cream" (aka engaged with other players) part because it was already established in the first sentence. If anything the "ice cream" part in the second sentence is redundant.

If it were not an "or" here I might almost be inclined to agree with you, but this is a clarification sentence explaining the legal situations in which you can attack an enemy engaged with another player, not a new part of the rule. This is even indicated by the "these targets" in the first part of the sentence. It just doesn't make sense for the "or" part here to be something completely different than the first part of the sentence that is clearly expanding upon the wording from the first sentence. If that was the case, it would be a separate sentence or even a separate paragraph.

Wow, Kiwina, that's the LONGEST post I ever saw in this forum. You should get a prize ;-)

No, your arguments don't come across to me as an attack. I like discussing subtleties of the rules, and we're focussing on the game here and don't get personal, so everything's fine.

Like before, Svenn already made a good point. In addition, I have this argument:

If it really were the case that the 2nd sentence is no clarification of the 1st (the clarification that it doesn't matter if the attack has been initiated by me or by another player), but instead the 2nd sentence provides another option of using the ranged keyword - why is the 1st sentence there at all? There would be no information in it. Why would FFG not have skipped the 1st sentence and just used this version of the 2nd:

"A character can declare ranged attacks against targets which are engaged with another player while its owner is declaring attacks; or it can participate in attacks that are declared by other players."

I think the answer is: Because there is information in the 1st sentence, and the 2nd is a clarification of it.

 The ice cream analogy turned on a lightbulb.  I finally see what I kept missing when you kept pointing at the first sentence, and how it ties in with the second.    I am very curious to see what FFG's responses to my queries about the Ranged keyword and Brand are.

 I got my answers back from Nate,

pumpkin, Svenn, and HilariousPete were correct.  A ranged character may only participate in attacks declared by other players that are targeting enemies engaged with other players.

I also asked about this:

HilariousPete said:


You say that ranged allows participating an attack of another player out-of-phase (I think you are referring to the "or it [the character] can participate in attacks that are declared by other players"-part of the rules here), and you say that ranged characters can't participate in out-of-phase attacks of your own, if I got you right. And here's where I cant find the reference for - the appropriate part of the rules reads "A character can declare ranged attacks against these targets while its owner is declaring attacks". If I'm player A and playing Quick Strike on an enemy engaged with B in e.g. resource phase, I'm declaring an attack, and while I'm doing this, I can declare another ranged participant. The rule doesn't go like "A character can declare ranged attacks against these targets while its owner is in phase 6 step 1 of combat resolution against enemies"...



The reply was:

So in your example, with Legolas (under your control) declaring the
attack, your other ranged characters are not eligible to participate
because:

1) They are not declaring the attack (Legolas is).

2) Another player is not declaring the attack (You are).

The situation in which the combo does work is this:

A) You play Quickstrike, declaring an attack with one of your
characters against an enemy with which you are engaged.

B) Now, by virtue of the ranged keyword, my characters can participate
in the attack.

Thx a lot for sharing this info!

Good to know that we were not too far away from the rules ;-) But to be honest, I'm not really sure to which example you were referring to afterwards (you quoted my example with player A and B and C, and Nate answered for a Legolas example with "you" and "me"...), and I'm having some difficulties with that. I suppose you did ask him about an example like this:

"I am player A, I have Legolas and another ranged character under my control, and I am using Quick Strike to declare Legolas as an attacker against an enemy engaged with me. Now can my second ranged character join?" (Nate's reasons (1) and (2): no, he can't) and "Can ranged characters of my buddy, player B, participate?" (Nate's answers (a) and (b): yes, they can).

Is this the case? If yes, then puh, very good ;-)

Or did you ask (more like my quoted example): "I'm player A, I have Legolas and a 2nd ranged character under my control. I'm playing Quick Strike on an enemy engaged with my buddy player B, declaring my Legolas as the attacker. Can my other ranged character participate? Can ranged characters of my buddy participate?" If this were the case then... wow, then I'm puzzled, I'd have to do a lot of thinking again, because I can't understand the reasoning yet, or I have misunderstood something....

Or perhaps did you ask a completely different example than those two I stated above?

Best regards, Pete

The A) and B) in Nate's response are sequential actions. He is merely pointing out that when using Quickstrike another player's characters could participate, however your characters cannot because they do not meet the requirements 1) and 2).

 

So Quickstrike + Ranged:

The character chosen for the Quickstrike is attacking. Ranged characters from other players may participate, so long as the enemy is not engaged with that player. The attacking player may not use his Ranged characters to participate because Quickstrike allows you to declare 1 character to attack (not multiple) and someone else is not declaring the attack so your Ranged keyword does not allow you to participate in their attack.

HilariousPete:

My question was more along the lines of the second one.  Something to the effect of: If I played a Quick Strike during the questing phase, and I exhaust Legolas to declare him an attacker against an enemy engaged with another player, can I also declare my other ranged characters as attackers?

Svenn's explanation is correct.

Just to make sure I'm perfectly clear on the underlined bit - So ranged characters may only participate (help out) in attacks against enemies engaged with other players.

 

For example, I'm engaged with a Hill Troll. I have Legolas and a Horseback Archer. I declare Legolas to attack the Hill Troll. Horseback Archer cannot participate in this attack. Had the Hill Troll been engaged with another player, both Legolas and Horseback Archer could have been declared as attackers/participated in an attack. Is this correct?

I'm sorry to belabor this, I just really want to make sure I understand correctly.

No, your ranged characters cannot help out if you are playing Quickstrike. Quickstrike allows you to desginate 1 character out of turn to attack, so you can only pick one (not multiple ranged characters). The ranged keyword allows you to attack enemies engaged with another player during your combat phase, OR it allows you to participate in attacks by other players. Since YOU are the one attacking, and it is out of phase with Quickstrike specifying 1 character, neither of these applies.

However, if your friend had a ranged character he COULD participate assuming all other requirements were met (the enemies cannot be engaged with him). So if you were engaged with the Hill Troll then your friend could use his ranged characters, you cannot. If your friend were engaged with the hill troll then neither of you may use your ranged characters. If a third player were engaged with the Hill Troll you would not be able to use your ranged characters nor would the third player with whom the Hill Troll is engaged... but your friend who is NOT engaged with the Hill Troll would be allowed to add his ranged characters.

However, if it's your turn to declare attacks during the combat phase you can have any characters you control participate in the attacks.  That answer was specifically about using Quick Strike.

Alright, forget the Quickstrike part. I understand that.

How about this:

2-player game. I'm engaged with Hill Troll. I have Legolas and Horseback Archer. I declare attack against Troll with Legolas. My partner has a Silverlode Archer, who may participate, but my Horseback Archer cannot participate, because Hill Troll is engaged with me, and I declared Legolas to attack. Is this correct?

Alternate case, if the Hill Troll were instead engaged with my partner, I could use both Legolas and my Horseback Archer as attackers/participate in an attack against the Troll.

Yes, that is how it works.  Now, if the Hill Troll was engaged with your friend you could still attack with both your ranged characters, but your friend wouldn't be able to assist with his archer.  In that situation you are better off waiting for your friend to declare an attack against the troll and then assist with your ranged character.

I didn't read through everything for an answer, but here's my question:

Can you lower your threat below 0 (into the negatives) with cards such as Galadrim's Greeting or Gandalf?

 I would rule, consistens with Nate's ruling on quest tokens - if a quest can have infinite amounts of progress tokens, so your threat can sink under 0... 0 being the optimal score anyway and everything else just a nice achievement...

Well, that specifically says negative score, not threat. If your threat is 0 and you have VPs you can easily go negative.

Personally, I would rule that you cannot go below 0. It seems silly from a gameplay perspective to keep going below that and it seems silly from a story perspective (how can you have less than no threat?).

Yeah, that's what I was thinking too, I just wasn't sure.  Basically, you could have an endless cycle of Galadrim's Greeting/Will of the West and just continue to lower your threat infinitely if you could go negative.

No, your ranged characters cannot help out if you are playing Quickstrike. Quickstrike allows you to desginate 1 character out of turn to attack, so you can only pick one (not multiple ranged characters). The ranged keyword allows you to attack enemies engaged with another player during your combat phase, OR it allows you to participate in attacks by other players. Since YOU are the one attacking, and it is out of phase with Quickstrike specifying 1 character, neither of these applies.

I disagree with this Svenn.

Quick strike gives you an extra "Declare" any character around the table that is able to (your own or others with Ranged Keyword) is free to join in that Attack. The mention of Exhausting One character is just a cost to pay to be able to declare it as an attacker, and specifies that you cannot use this card to declare an already exhausted character as attacker.

See FAQ... I think this is even a specific Example in there.

Example: Tom exhausts Aragorn to attack a Hill Troll, and Kris exhausts Legolas to participate in the attack. The Hill Troll takes 3 wounds but survives. All characters in play are then readied via Grim Resolve (CORE 25). Because the Hill Troll has already been attacked by Tom, he cannot declare another attack against it this round except through a card effect. So if Tom exhausts Aragorn to play Quick Strike (CORE 35) which reads, "Action: Exhaust a character you control to immediately declare it as an attacker..." both Aragorn and Legolas could attack the Hill Troll again.


To Repeat the important part; Using Quick Strike, both Aragorn and Legolas could attack the Hill Troll again.

Keep in mind, in the example Tom plays Quick Strike to use Aragorn and Kris used Legolas' ranged powers to participate.  If Tom had both Aragorn and Legolas he would have to settle for only using one of them with his Quick Strike.

I completely disagree with that.

Simple really.

It's an Attack. Anyone that can legally Join the Attack is allowed to do so, my own characters or others (if they have Ranged keyword). Anything else would have to be explicitly excluded by the card text. And it's not. IMO.

Maybe a new FAQ clarification around this is needed, cause if I'm wrong here (could be of course) I have to say I'm completely blind sided by this.

Anyone can legally join an attack that is allowed to do so BUT when playing quickstrike, no other characters are legally allowed to join except the character on which quickstrike has been played, except ranged attackers controlled by other players because the rules state "Ranged attackers can participate in attacks declared by other players" - this rule is not connected to any specific phase of the game, and hence applies at all times.

Are you saying that when you currently play quickstrike on a character, you allow any other character that is ready and can attack the enemy to also join in the attack? I don't think that is the intention of quick strike at all.

This is not the intention, and was covered in the answer from Nate. When playing Quickstrike you may only attack with a single character, not multiple characters. The only way to have multiple characters attacking is for another player (who is not engaged with the enemy being attacked) to have characters with the Ranged attribute who can attack. Nate spelled this out pretty clearly.

The rules don't support this either. Quick Strike allows you to immediately exhaust a single character to declare it as an attacker. Unless you are playing this during the attacking portion of your turn (and why would you do that when you can already attack?) then you are unable to declare any other attackers since you are not in the correct phase for attacking. If you were able to attack with any number of characters it would say "Exhaust any number of attackers to declare them as attackers".

I agree. My question was a specific question to GhostWolf69 and trying to ascertain how s/he plays QuickStrike, as on the face of it, it does seem to contradict what we already know from Nate.

Yes. That is exactly what I'm saying.

*shrugs*

I see how you are doing it, and I re-read the rules, and I agree that you are in the right to interpret it this way... it could be done like that. And if Nate says so I guess it is suppose to be like that. Have to admit though, this is the first "sinking feeling" I've got since I started to play this game.

I don't like it... Cards referring to a generic game element, such as "Declaring an Attack" should explicitly say if this Action should exclude other elements from that. Clearly. If you have to look through several pages of rules to decipher what the card means you're in trouble. ... or in this case... I might be in trouble. I really don't like it... becomes too complex and cumbersome and you soon have to be a lawyer to even run the game... screw that.

First we read this to mean only ONE hero attacking period, then with the FAQ example we all went: Ahhhhh so other characters can join as usual when declaring an attack, now... something like others can join if they have the Ranged Keyword and are not controlled by you... Honestly?

I realise you are probably right guys.. I just don't like it.

I dunno, this doesn't seem that complicated to me. I mean, I only ever read Quick Strike as a single character getting to attack.

Just a quickie, hopefully to conclude this Ranged Quick Strike matter (and not to complicate it any more). I have Legolas and Brand, and an enemy engaged with another player. I Quick Strike that enemy with Legolas, can Brand join in? He is a ranged character controlled by a player not engaged with the attacked enemy.

No, this was answered above. Quick Strike allows YOU to specify a single attacker, not multiple. Ranged keyword only allows you to "join in" on attacks made by other players, not your own. In order for both to attack you need to be able to declare both as attackers, but Quick Strike only allows you to declare a single attacker, not multiple.

I submitted a rules clarification to FFG regarding this scenario, and posted it on the forums.  The first part is my question.

Kiwina said:

Something to the effect of: If I played a Quick Strike during the questing phase, and I exhaust Legolas to declare him an attacker against an enemy engaged with another player, can I also declare my other ranged characters as attackers?

The reply was:

So in your example, with Legolas (under your control) declaring the
attack, your other ranged characters are not eligible to participate
because:

1) They are not declaring the attack (Legolas is).

2) Another player is not declaring the attack (You are).

The situation in which the combo does work is this:

A) You play Quickstrike, declaring an attack with one of your
characters against an enemy with which you are engaged.

B) Now, by virtue of the ranged keyword, my characters can participate
in the attack.

Ok, I thought it was the Ranged character cannot be engaged with the attacked enemy, 'cause that to me would make much more sense thematicaly.

So this is slightly different to the conclusion HilariousPete and I came to earlier in the thread.

In our discussion, we finally came to the conclusion that the statement A character can declare ranged attacks against these targets while its owner is declaring attacks meant that if I (the owner) declared Legolas as a ranged attacker using quickstrike against an enemy engaged with another player, other characters that I own could also declare ranged attacks. But that statement is not relevant in this case and only the seoncd statement allowing ranged characters of other players to participate in the attack , is.

I hear you guys. I do. Honest.

To me it's just a matter of Golden Rule application: There's card text and then there's Rules as Written.

So in this particular case we have rules as written for How Characters can participate in Attacks declared. (Ranged or other wise, simply by exhausting if they are under your control and you declare an attack against an engaged enemy.)

And then there's card text... Quick Strike.

The text here is either Over Riding RAW, creating an exeption or it's Not. IT could of course be expressed in more detail if it wants to override part of the ruls and not others, but that would require a more detailed text... something I think is lacking here...

Now if you ask me, I think most of us read this card to mean "Single Character Only" to start with. Right? This we did since it said "Single Character" and "it's attack" etc... not that strange really... and if we apply that then we cannot use Ranged characters, or any other characters either for that matter.

Then the FAQ came along and al of a sudden there was an example in there nullifying my original interpretation... in this example is was bleeding obvious that another character "could join"... granted he had the Ranged keyword but reading the example didn't make you feel like that was the focus of the example, neither was the Quick Strike card actually, but it appeared in a context where Declaring Attacks and Characters attacking out of turn etc was covered.

Ok... so I have to change how we play...

Basically if a player is allowed to declare an attack via Card Text... then normal rules apply. And others can join in, as per normal rules.

Now... this particular situation we have after "Nate" opened up... I don't know guys... I don't see it in the card text. Card Text is still pretty much exclusive and doesn't invite other characters to join in at all IMO. I'm leaning towards going back to my original interpretation because this half-this-half-that-because-some-dude-said-so-nonsense REALLY rubs me the wrong way.

Sorry for taking up your time with this. Move on. There's nothing to see here. Just ignore the grumpy old cantankerous **** in the corner (that is; me gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif] ).

Here is the simple explanation: Both Quick Strike and Ranged are overriding the default combat rules. Quick Strike overrides the ability to attack only in the attacking portion of the combat phase by allowing you to declare a single attacker. Ranged overrides the default multiple attackers rule by allowing you to join in on any attack made by another player against an enemy with which you are not engaged.

Yeah, but it also overrides the normal rules that says you can exhaust other characters to join in the attack... unless they are Ranged... and not controlled by you... apparently... although the card doesn't really tell you this, but leaves you guessing or asking "Nate".

We have exhausted this by now. I bow out and will confer with my group on how we should handle this. In the end that is all that matters.

Are you implying that if I use QuickStrike during the Normal Combat phase, just to get a "second go" at the same Enemy, I WOULD be allowed to join other characters to the attack?

No of course you're not. That would be silly. So... in effect, Quick Strike over-rides that rule. Like I said.

not sure if this has been raised yet, still reading through responses, but the answer to Q57 seems wrong. The instructions for Guarded on page 24 of the rules clearly say that cards guarding an objective are revealed and attached. Are we certain this is not a problem with the wording on the quest card?

I know, it's silly. But in effect the FAQ says:

"(1.22) "When Revealed" Effects

A card is only considered to be revealed if the card or game effect causing the card to enter play specifically uses a form of the word "reveal"."

Now... the Setup Instructions of the Dol Goldur Quest (since the Question is for that specific Quest) does NOT contain the word "Reveal" it simply says "Attach"... hence, according to the FAQ, no "When Revealed Effect" can be triggered.

Me personally? I think this kind of thing is crap... they probably meant to say "reveal and attach" but thought they could save some space on the card by cutting it short. Then when the FAQ came out it all went sideways... now we end up with silly stuff like this.

Q57's fine in this thread. You can argue, that Dol Guldur 1A states to attach 1 guard to each objective. And only attaching means not triggering then "when revealed" effects.

Or you can argue otherwise, that the guarded keywords are in effect, as usual. (Like you pointed out.)

You have to decide for one option, and regardless how you decide, some rule or game text seems broken ;-) After a rules question, FFG/Nate French, the game designer, decided for the first option, no "when revealed".  I don't know the logic behind it, and hope it will be reasoned well in the next official FAQ, but meanwhile I play according to it. Here's the source on BGG [http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/708411/no-for-dol-guldur-but-yes-for-eleanor].

Yeah. My group still play it like we did originally...i.e. The "When Revealed Effects" are triggered.

Most of the time it doesn't do much, since a lot of the cards in there raise threat until end of current phase or damages characters comitted to the quest etc. But some DO have an effect. Like "King Spider", "Caught in a Web", "Iron Shackles" etc.

not sure if this has been raised yet, still reading through responses, but the answer to Q57 seems wrong. The instructions for Guarded on page 24 of the rules clearly say that cards guarding an objective are revealed and attached.

 

 

 

I know, it's silly. But in effect the FAQ says:

"(1.22) "When Revealed" Effects

A card is only considered to be revealed if the card or game effect causing the card to enter play specifically uses a form of the word "reveal"."

Now... the Setup Instructions of the Dol Goldur Quest (since the Question is for that specific Quest) does NOT contain the word "Reveal" it simply says "Attach"... hence, according to the FAQ, no "When Revealed Effect" can be triggered.

Me personally? I think this kind of thing is crap... they probably meant to say "reveal and attach" but thought they could save some space on the card by cutting it short. Then when the FAQ came out it all went sideways... now we end up with silly stuff like this.

I instead bet that for DolGuldur setup they really want to say only "attach" without triggering the "reveal" effect.

We have 3 objective in the staging area, each one of them will raise threat if claimed, and we should even have to suffer three when reaveled effect on the first turn with no attachment, no allies, low reaources to spend?

I'm just telling you what I think and how I play it. I don't mean to convince anyone that "my way" is the "true official way". Absolutely not.

If you want to take the official sissy way out and play nice with all the bad bad cards in there because you think they are so mean to your nice little heroes. By all means go ahead. gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]

Neither I.

I just tried to think why Nate French said to don't use the "reveal" effect on Dol Guldur.

And I thought that the simpliest answer was that he (or they) designed the quest in that way: no reavel on Dol Guldur.

Since the nature of the game, which ins't PvP,  I believe that we must play it the way it enjoys us the most, even if this should mean to twaek some rules or ignore some official FAQs.

But I'll always have the pleasure to discover how I should I've played it :-)

That means the "guarded" keyword is not resolved in this case? Because the objective cards would have two encounter cards attached otherwise.

Q57's fine in this thread. You can argue, that Dol Guldur 1A states to attach 1 guard to each objective. And only attaching means not triggering then "when revealed" effects.

Or you can argue otherwise, that the guarded keywords are in effect, as usual. (Like you pointed out.)

You have to decide for one option, and regardless how you decide, some rule or game text seems broken ;-) After a rules question, FFG/Nate French, the game designer, decided for the first option, no "when revealed".  I don't know the logic behind it, and hope it will be reasoned well in the next official FAQ, but meanwhile I play according to it. Here's the source on BGG [http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/708411/no-for-dol-guldur-but-yes-for-eleanor].

Ah, GhostWolf has been fester than me, but perhaps the link is of interest to you.



I see the logic behind it very clear. If you play solo and you get a nasty "when revealed" resolved in the set up, you can basicaly start over. I do not think that is a good way.

And as others said, if the guarded were to resolve in this case, you would have ended up with two encounters attached - also absurd. The guarded resolves when it enters the staging area from the encounter deck, which is not this case.

It's not? You're kidding right? During Set-up, I would say that any card that you place in the Staging Area has to be said to "enters the staging area from the encounter deck" what other definition could there possibly be? They are not "revealed" that's for sure, but enters staging area from Encounter deck? Surely they must be.

But I do agree that the notion of having TWO cards attached to each Objective is a little absurd, even though the rules clearly states that it is possible to end up like that. I still think this is a clear case of trying to correct one error by making another.

Just change the Quest card to say "Place the Objective cards in the staging area and resolve their Guarded Effect as usual". There. Fixed it.

I agree with GhostWolf69. We already discuss this issue on french board and that was our conclusion. The text on the quest card seems to be a reminder for the guarded keyword.

Keep in mind that was the first time the objectif cards and the guarded keyword were introduced in the game.

So you say you would resolve the "when revealed", what would that fix? A good chance of getting Caught in a Web, King Spider or Eyes of the Forest, to think of few. Meaning, in solo play, you start with 1 character and the other in the Web, or just 1 character ready, or without event cards... I think that fixes not for the best.

And I assume guarded does not trigger during the set up, that is why they put the phrase about attaching encounter cards, it is the only explanation I can think of now.

I agree with one thing, it is hard to imagine where the cards are coming from if not the encounter deck...

Oh really?

"(1.19) Card Effects during Setup
"When Revealed" effects are resolved if the cards are revealed during setup. A player can trigger responses during setup, following the normal game rules. Players cannot take Actions during setup."

So according to you, the game has not started yet... and we can still play cards, exhaust Eovyn etc. ? Is that it?

I repeat. The simplest way is to just admit the Quest card is wrong, place the Objectives in the Staging Area and execute the Guarded Keyword as per the normal rules. Any other solution just ends up having to justify stupid exceptions for regular rules. Where as my proposed solution doesn't have ANY flaws, other than the game being slightly more difficult, something I personally can live with.

We can play cards during set up? I guess those that are responses and cost 0. Exhaust Éowyn? You mean Eleanor.

You are trying hard to make your words sound right. And others' stupid. In fact there is no evidence the cards are entering the staging are from the encounter deck during the set up. Or say if there is. And your simple versions may not be the simplest either, simple is to do what is intended. In this case, attach a card to each objective without resolving "when revealed". Is there anything difficult about that now?

Moreso there is no other guarded objective being used for set up, so there is no consistency problem either.

I have to agree with Ghostwolf. I think the when revealed effects are triggered because it says on p24 of the rules "The guarded keyword is a reminder in some objective cards to reveal and attach the next card of the encounter deck to the objective when it enters the staging area from the encounter deck..." the guard has a when revealed effect it gets resolved.

Jolly good.

 

However, the FAQ entry will stay because it is based on a response from Nate on BGG.

I sort of hope it does change when the offiical FAQ comes out, but for now the unoffiical FAQ won't be changing.

Try your fun then. Because by this logic you will start with SIX encounter cards in the staging area, if you follow the rules still.

Yes you can, but why would you? you still have to resolve the attack. As far as I can see, you might as well just resolve the original attack as per normal and save quick strike for dealing with an enemy when you are not in the combat phase. Why would you spend a resource to declare an attack when you can just declare without spending the resource anyway?

That is how it works.  A shadow card leaves play when the card it's attached to leaves play or at the end of the combat phase, whichever one comes first.  That way, if you kill an enemy before Step 3 of their attack, the shadow card is discarded with them and never has a chance to resolve.

Hello all,

I'm a new to this game and non free English speaker so I'll have lots of questions.

Lets start:

1. When Legolas kills and enemy two progress tokens should be added to the active location. If there is 1 progress token is needed to finish it, should I place 1 to active location and 1 to current quest?

2. Game for 2 players. During the combat phase the first player attacks some enemy engaged with him (i.e. Hill Troll). Can the second player attack (using his ready Ranged characters) the same enemy (Hill Troll) that have just already attacked by the first player?

3. Can a ranged character of one player participate in attack provided by a ranged character of the same player against the enemy engaged with another player?

4. Eowyn's ability allows to discard 1 card from each player's hand to get +1 willpower. How many times it can be used each round? Only once by each player or as so many times as players have cards to discard them?

Thank you

1. Yes, always place tokens on the active location first and then any excess go to the quest. However, if you only needed 1 token on the current quest stage then you do NOT place the excess on the next quest stage.

2. Yes. Each player may DECLARE an attack against an eligible enemy once. Durying player 1's turn he can declare an attack against an enemy and player 2 may participate. During player 2's turn he may then declare an attack against the same enemy because he has not declared an attack against that enemy that round, only participated in an attack declared by another player.

3. Yes. You can declare any number of ranged characters in an attack when making a declaration against an enemy engaged with another player.

4. Each player may discard up to 1 card per round for this effect. This is right on the card "This effect may be triggered by each player once per round. "

 If player A attacks an enemy that is engaged with him, is player B allowed to add his ranged characters in that fight?



Yes. As long as the enemies are not engaged with player B then player B may participate in an attack against those enemies.

Thanks, that's what i thought - but it wouldn't have been the first time that I interpreted the rules falsely.

1. When I'm playing for example Escape from Dol Guldur scenario (CORE) can I use for example tactics cards from some other set (i.e. A Journey to Rhosgobel) for my deck? And what is the limit of cards in player's deck: 30 or 50? Is it possible to have 3 Gandalfs in player's deck?

2. When a current location (Enchanted Stream) says "While Enchanted Stream is the active location, players cannot draw cards." and by some card effect location Mountains of Mirkwood leaves play (Response: After Mountains of Mirkwood leaves play as an explored location, each player may search the top 5 cards of his deck for 1 card and add it to his hand. Shuffle the rest of the searched cards back into their owners' decks.) can I use it's response and draw a card?

3. If one player has a card that allows to return any hero from discard pile (Fortune of Fate), is it possible to return another player into the game if he was eliminated?

4. Can a "Dwarven Tomb" card (Spirit) return a spirit hero from discard pile?

5. Can a  "Hasty Stroke" card (Spirit) be used for any player or only an owner of card?

6. Can "Blade Mastery" and "Swift Strike" cards (Tactics) be used for any player?

7. If my threat level is 30, can I optional engage enemy with threat level 31 or more?

8. Does scenario's "Journey Down the Anduin" 3B means that every round I won't reveal cards from encounter deck?

9. If there is no more free tokens (resource, progress, damage) in the bank? Should I use some virtual tokens or no just no to put expected tokens to where they are needed?

#1: 3 of any card is the max you can have, 50 is the tournament minimum.

#2: Yes, Enchanted Stream prevents drawing of cards, but effects adding them to your hand are not affected.

#3: I believe so.

#4: No, only specific effects can return heroes from the discard pile, Fortune and Fate plus Landroval.

#5: No restriction on the card so could cancel another player's shadow effect.

#6: Same as #5 for me.

#7: Yes.

#8: Yes.

#9: IIRC, tokens are unlimited, proxy more if needed.

Just want to clarify the 'multiple' defenders rule, as I'm confused with the 'damage must be on 1 defender' things I'm hearing.

 

Imagine Player 1 has two enemies engaged with him, 'Enemy 1' and 'Enemy 2'.
Player 1 has two readied Heroes he's declaring as defenders, 'Hero 1', 'Hero 2'.

Ignoring Shadow effects and Actions, etc. is this correct:

 * Player decides 'Enemy 1' will attack 'Hero 1'. 'Hero 1' defends, but still suffers 1 damage.
 * Player decides 'Enemy 2' will attack 'Hero 2'. 'Hero 2' defends, but still suffers 2 damage.

And If there were 3 enemies engaged with 2 heroes, would this be legal:

 * Player decides 'Enemy 1' will attack 'Hero 1'. 'Hero 1' defends, but still suffers 1 damage.
 * Player decides 'Enemy 2' will attack 'Hero 1' as well. 'Hero 1' defends, but still suffers 2 damage, now totalling 3 damage.
 * Player decides 'Enemy 3' will attack 'Hero 2'. 'Hero 2' defends, but still suffers 2 damage.

Thanks.

1. 50 is the minimum set forth by the rules. This is the official FFG minimum for their events. If you want to stick strictly by the rules then 50 is the minimum. Some players house rule that they can use smaller decks.

2. Hero cards are not regular cards that are a part of your deck. From the rules:

"There are three different types of decks in The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game: the quest deck, the encounter deck, and the player deck. There are also hero cards, which do not belong to any deck."

"Note that hero cards that are defeated are placed in their owner’s discard pile. When resolving effects that move cards from a player’s discard pile to his hand or deck, hero cards in the discard pile are ignored, as hero cards cannot move to a player’s hand or deck."

There are a few things to note here. First of all, you resolve attacks one at a time. Normally you can only declare a single defender for a single attacker. You only have "multiple defenders" through a card effect (Stand Together) where multiple characters defend against a single enemy. In this case you add up their defense value and subtract it from the enemy attack value and then assign all of the remaining damage to only 1 of the defenders.

Secondly, in your examples above you resolve everything one at a time, so the first example would be legal. The second example would be legal as long as you have a way to ready Hero 1 after Enemy 1 attacks. Otherwise Hero 1 will exhaust when Enemy 1 attacks and he cannot defend Enemy 2 as he is exhausted. With 2 readied characters and 3 enemies you can only block 2 of the enemies and the third attack will be undefended.

So 'Multiple Defenders' implies more than 1 defender for a single attack. I was confusing it as you couldn't have more than 1 character defending during the phase. This means the following example would be an illegal move if no special action/event cards were played:

 * Player decides 'Enemy 1' will attack.  'Hero 1' and 'Hero 2' defend this attack together, blocking all but 1 damage, which is assigned to 'Hero 1'.

I didn't consider the character exhausting after a single defend, which is good to note. That's why I love forum boards, they really help clear up the bits you miss. Thanks.

Correct. Multiple Defenders is illegal unless you have a specific card effect that allows it. Currently, Stand Together is the only card that allows this.

@Svenn: You are right! I didn't mentioned that. Thank you for clarification.

And what is about lack of tokens? I ask because I had a situation when there were no resource tokens in bank, and Chieftan Ufthak which I was engaged with attacked me. So it will be good no to put on him 1 resource token.

I just came across this post from a Boardgamegeek forum regarding Legolas and the Blade of Gondolin:

 

Legolas says: "Response: After Legolas participates in an attack that destroys an enemy, place 2 progress tokens on the current quest."

Blade of Gondolin says: "Response: After attached hero attacks and destroys an enemy, place 1 progress token on the current quest."

They're saying the same thing. It's just dodgy templating - they should have been worded slightly more consistently. Blade of Gondolin just turns any hero into a half-Legolas.

 

Am I right in disagreeing with this? I think that Legolas doesn't have to destroy the enemy, he only needs to have participated in the enemy being killed.

So if Legolas damages an enemy, and Thalin kills the same enemy straight after, then Legolas still gets his response.

The Blade of Gondolin is specific in saying that it works if the "attached Hero attacks and destroys."

Would anyone else agree with me here?

 

If so, would you consider Legolas' response to still work if he damaged an enemy in round 1, but Thalin killed that enemy in round 2? I think it should be on the same round, but nothing states this.

They are the same thing. Legolas has to participate in the attack that kills the enemy. If Legolas damages the enemy and the enemy is later killed after that combat is over, you do not get to activate Legolas' response.

Also, keep in mind that you can only declare a single attack against any enemy on your turn, so if you controlled both Legolas and Thalin you cannot attack with Legolas then attack with Thalin after. You CAN attack the enemy with Legolas and Thalin at the same time, which is more beneficial to you anyways since you only count the defense once and not twice.

If you control Legolas and another player controls Thalin then you can just wait until the other play attacks with Thalin and join in with Legolas since he has the Ranged keyword. Again, this is more beneficial than declaring an attack with Legolas then the other player declaring an attack on the same enemy later with Thalin.

If I have two enemies, I must chose only 1 to attack.

 

If that's right then I'm surprised, as the enemies can attack once each during the combat phase, with shadow effects, but the Heroes can only attack one enemy.

If you have one enemy you can attack him both with Legolas and Thalin simultaneously. But not with a Legolas and then with Thalin.

And yes, if you have 2 enemies you can attack one with Legolas and second with Thalin. Or to attack only one enemy with both Legolas and Thalin (the second enemy won't be attacked).

Attacking works differently than defending. You CAN declare multiple attackers when attacking, in which case you combine their attack power against the enemy's defense. When declaring an attack you can declare as many attackers as you have eligible to participate. However, you can only declare a single attack against an enemy per turn.

Examples:

You have Enemy 1 (defense value 2) and Enemy 2 engaged with you and you have Legolas and Thalin readied.

You CAN declare an attack against Enemy 1 with both Legolas and Thalin, combining their attack power (3 + 2 = 5) and subtracting the enemy's defense (5-2 = 3 damage).
You can NOT declare an attack against Enemy 1 with Legolas (3 attack power - 2 defense = 1 damage) and then AFTERWARDS declare another attack against Enemy 1 with Thalin (2 attack power - 2 defense = 0 damage).
You CAN declare an attack against Enemy 1 with Legolas. Then after that attack resolves you CAN declare an attack on Enemy 2 with Thalin.

I'm guessing this is Legolas' Ranged ability. If so, can this only be done on the other player's engaged enemy?

It is said in rules:

A player may declare multiple characters as attackers against a single enemy, pooling their attack strength into a single value.

Condition is only that they both should be ready to declare attack.

Legolas's Ranged ability only allows you to attack 1) with Thalin an enemy engaged with you and 2) with Legolas an enemy enagaged with another player.

#1: I think for many people tournament rules are the ones they use to build their decks with, even if they don't ever take part in them. Game is based on people having 50-card decks I believe, thus it is listed as the normal minimum deck size.

#4: "Note that hero
cards that are defeated are placed in their owner’s
discard pile. When resolving effects that move cards
from a player’s discard pile to his hand or deck, hero
cards in the discard pile are ignored, as hero cards
cannot move to a player’s hand or deck." (p. 20)

Played my first two player game yesterday on the 'Passage through Mirkwood' quest, we loved it.

A few scenarios came up we'd like some clarification on:

 

 1. I played the core Spirit deck. My friend played the core Leadership deck. Théodred (Hero - Leadership) was killed. I waited for a player window and used Fortune or Fate (Event - Spirit) card to bring him back into play. The text reads: "Choose a hero in any player's discard pile. Put that card into play, under its owner's control.". Was that a legal move?
     
 2. We were in the quest phase, and the encounter deck's 2 cards were revealed. We looked at playing the Power in the Earth (Attachment - Spirit) card to play on a location, to boost the quest numbers. We didn't play it, as it was an attachment, and we read that attachments could only be played during the Planning phase. Were we right?
     
 3. Are there any limits to how many Allies you can have in play? (Exclude unique allies).
     
 4. Theodred has the text: "Response: After Theodred commits to a quest, choose a hero committed to that quest. Add 1 resource to that hero's resource pool." Can this include Theodred?
     
 5. Valiant Sacrifice (Event - Leadership) has the text: "Response: After an ally card leaves play. that card's controller draws 2 cards." Can this be used for any player?

3. Nope.

4. Sure, any hero that is currently committed to the quest, including Theodred.

5. Yes. Whoever controlled the ally that left play will draw the 2 cards. That's why it specifies "that card's controller" rather than simply stating that you draw 2 cards.

When this card can be played? Immediately after the ally was destroyed or before, on player's action time? If before, what is duration of this effect?

When a hero is killed, I know it doesn't go to the player discard pile, so does it go to a 'hero discard pile'? This is why we were confused as since a Hero doesn't go to the player discard pile, and that card revives heroes from the player discard pile...I got a tad muddled.

Actually, when a hero is killed it DOES go to the discard pile. It can't be pulled out by any normal effects though. In fact, I think that might be the only card that lets you interact with the hero from the discard pile.

"Note that hero
cards that are defeated are placed in their owner’s
discard pile. When resolving effects that move cards
from a player’s discard pile to his hand or deck, hero
cards in the discard pile are ignored, as hero cards

Valiant Sacrifice card (Event - Leadership) has the text: "Response: After an ally card leaves play, that card's controller draws 2 cards."

When this card should be played?

Directly when the character has left play. (If you're wondering because of the green + red bars in the back of the rules booklet - it's a response, so it can be played in red bars, too, if the condition of a leaving ally is met.)

Situation: Journey along the Anduin 2B. Thalin is commited to quest. After the 3rd step of quest phase (Quest resolution) some progress tokens puts on quest and it finishes.

No, because Thalin hasn't been questing while the enemy cards were revealed (quest resolution means that the quest  in which Thalin was questing has been resolved so Thalin isn't questing anymore).

Totally false.  Characters are considered committed to a quest from the moment they are committed until the end of the quest phase.  See the game rulebook, page 14, last paragraph.  Thalin would still ping the enemies in that situation.

Well, you have a point here.

However, the rules also say that "This (quest) phase is broken into three steps: 1) commit characters, 2) staging, and 3) quest resolution." You place the new quest card after the quest resolution, so technically the quest phase is already over when you place the new enemies. But then it's not the travel phase either, yeah,so you might be indeed right here, but I'm not sure if this is how it's intended to be.

Forget it, of course you're right. I totally forgot that it's the effect of the 1B card that triggers the additional enemy, not that of the 2B card.

Um, this depends on what LEGA meant with "After the 3rd step of quest phase" ;-)

If this "after" means in another phase, e.g. in combat phase, and the progress tokens are placed on 2B because of Legolas' ability, then the new enemies don't get damage by Thalin, because charcters are considered committed only for the remainder of the quest phase.

If LEGA meant in the 3rd step (but just after calculating committed willpower - threat strength) then you're right.

@HilariousPete: I meant just after calculating committed willpower - treat strength and before Travel phase.

Thank you for answers.

I have another question: Here in this unofficial FAQ in 59 said that successful questing is when committed willpower > (more than) treat strength. Is it right? Is if they are equal the quest unsuccessful?

if willpower < threat, than you/the players "quested unsuccessfully", if willpower > threat than "successfully". If there's a tie, FFG didn't create a special name for it. It's neither successfully nor unsuccessfully (see rules p. 14, on the right, there are 3 paragraphs about it).

This could be important for some cards, e.g. Dungeon Jailor (if it's a tie, you're lucky) or Signs of Gollum (if it's a tie, you're unlucky).

Why is it unlucky when you get a tie in HfG? I'm personally very happy when I achieve this in stage 1B as it means no additional encounter card.

I was referring to the Signs of Gollum, not to The Hunt Begins. If Signs of Gollum is in play and there's a tie in willpower - threat, players can't claim the objective, and this can be bad for 3B, if not everyone (or even none) has a Clue.

4. Common Cause says: “Exhaust 1 hero you control to choose and ready a different hero.” I can ready the hero of any player?

6. Can I use “”Sneak Attack” on Gandalf?
7. What is “topmost attachment” means in response of Erebor Hammersmith? It is attachment that I most want to return, or that is situated higher than other attachments in discard pile?
8. In Thicket of Spears card said that I must use resource from 3 different heroes’ pools to pay for it. 1) Should it be my heroes? 2) Should all 3 heroes be Tactics? 3) Can all 3 heroes be no Tactics?
9. Situation: I have no Leadership heroes but I have a Dwarf hero (i.e. Gimli). Will Brok Ironfest plays if Gimli leaves play?
10. Situation: I use Sneak Attack on Wandering Took, and use Took’s action. Should I return Took to my hand (even he is on other player’s control now)?

#1: Either of the first two Green windows during the Quest Phase, although to get the least risky use out of him, use him during the second Green window (after encounter deck cards are drawn and revealed).

#2: No.

#3: Responses are always optional.

#4: Any player's.

#5: Sure.

#6: Who else would you use it on gran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif] ?

#7: If your discard pile has (from the bottom up): Ally, Event, Attachment #1, Event, Event, Attachment #2, Ally, you can only bring up Att #2 to your hand.

#8: You have to pay for it with only your heroes and need 3 Tactics heroes to pay for it. Once the Song giving Tactics icon to a hero comes, ToS might be seeing more action.

#9: Yes.

#10: Hmm. I think you would, since it is still in play.

#11: I think that comes under:

"Any time a card leaves play, it reverts to
its owner’s hand, deck, or discard pile (as directed by
the effect forcing the card out of play)." (p. 25)

So whoever had it in their deck originally, still owns the card even if you have temporary control over it, so Stand and Fight ally would go back to whichever discard pile you took it from.

#12: Yes, but have to use it during the first Green window of the Quest phase, that is the only time you can commit characters.

#13: Yes.

1. Correct. He is not committing to the quest.

2. No, it specifies a location. You cannot place it on the quest.

3. "Response" is optional. You can choose not to activate it. If it was "Forced" however you do not have a choice.

4. Yes, any player. It does not specify it must be your hero.

5. Yes, a card is still considered to have entered play when you use Sneak Attack so you can activate responses. Yes, you can use Landroval's Response while he is in play from Sneak Attack.

6. Yes.

7. It means the one nearest the top of the discard pile. You do not get to choose.

8. It must be all 3 of your heroes and they all must have the Tactics resource icon. You cannot play cards using resources from another player's heros. You cannot pay for a tactics card with resources from a non-Tactics hero.

9. Yes. The response does not specify that it must be a Leadership hero for the effect, so any Dwarf hero will do.

10. Yes, it still returns to your hand. It will not stay in play nor will it go to the other player's hand since you are the owner of the card, even though you don't currently control it.

11. Discarded cards always go to their owner's discard pile, regardless of who currently controls the card.

12. Yes. You would have to play Sneak Attack at the very beginning of the quest phase (it is green, so you can play actions there) BEFORE you commit ANY characters to the quest (since all characters have to be committed simultaneously).

13. Yes, you can use it for any hero committed to a quest.

Hi Folks,

I'm brand new to this game. In the past I was a huge fan of the Decipher LOTR TCG, and I still have all those cards (enjoying them only very occasionally). Recently it's been all Heroscape and Summoner Wars for me. But... then I stumbled across this beauty, and I think I'm about to be HOOKED!

I have not purchased the game yet, but I had the opportunity to play today for the first time (solo, 30 card Leadership deck, against the 1st quest from the core set). It seems to be everything I hoped and dreamed it could be. So, I'm about to take the plunge.

But I have a question from today's game!

During the Questing Phase, if a hero committed to the quest is killed and taken out of play, do I get to count the destroyed hero's willpower toward the quest for that phase? In my example, I had quested with Gloin (who already had 3 wounds), and I pulled a Treachery Card (don't remember which one) that forced me to place an additional wound on all exhausted characters. Gloin was killed, and I mournfully laid him to rest in my discard pile. So, do I get to count his 2 willpower toward the questing for that phase or not? I erred on the side of difficulty, not counting it. However, I didn't feel completely settled about that. Any thoughts?

Thanks in advance.

If a character gets killed during the quest, his willpower will not be added.

 

The questing phase is splitted in three steps:

 

1) committing characters to the quest

2) staging encounter cards and handle their effects

3) quest resolution

 

As Gloin died during the staging step, his willpower won't be added during the quest resolution.

good point, I suggest you exhaust your characters to commit, and then in the player actions window after revealing the encounter cards, play we do not sleep and ready any rohan characters. either that or you must be able to do player actions before committing, otherwise the card doesn't work. If you look at the turn sequence guide on page 30 of the rule book it says:

"Green - Any player can take actions generally, or between the game steps stated in the rules"

So I think that means that you can take action after the quest phase begins but before committing characters.

In my opinion is work like this:

Quest phase:

1 Resovle all effects : Beginning of the quest phase.

2 Player action.

3 Commit characters to the quest.

4 Staging (reveal encounter cards).

5 Players actions.

6 Resolve quest.

7 Players Actions.

Responses allow in any time of the phase.

Seems like a silly question, but I can't find it spelled out anywhere specifically in the rules...

When a hero is killed, are all of their remaining resource tokens also removed from play at that time along with them?

I would imagine the answer is yes. Just seeking confirmation.

Well, you're right it doesn't say in the rules anywhere, but it does say on page 9 that if the card to which an attachment is attached leaves play, the attachment card is discarded. So by that reason if your hero dies you discard any attachments, so it would stand to reason that the resources in that hero's pool would also be discarded. That's how I play anyway :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

They probably should create a location card called "LOTR The Cardgame Rulebook".

 

Text:

 

Threat level: X (x is the amount of keywords you haven't understood yet)

Points: 10

 

When revealed: Remove all progress tokens from the current quest

 

Travel: Exhaust all of your characters with a willpower less than 2 to travel to the LOTR The Cardgame Rulebook.

 

Response: When the LOTR The Cardgame Rulebook has been explored, search the encounter deck for the Unofficial FAQ - clue card and place it in the staging area.

It doesn't work like this. Page 14 states:

This phase is broken into three steps: 1) commit characters, 2) staging,and 3) quest resolution. Players have the opportunity to take actions and play event cards at the end of each step.

There is no possibility to play actions before committing, but the wording of "We Do Not Sleep" states it has to be played before. If it was meant, that characters ready again, it should be written different.

@Glaurung: I think the sequence you've given is FFG's intended sequence (with the small exception of an additional "Player actions" step between your step #3 and #4, according to rulebook p. 14), and if we would send a rules question to them, I'll bet we get that as an answer.

Unfortunately, that's not what FFG has written in the rules. Page 14 only grants actions between steps, not before them, like Stahlwolle pointed out before me.

I've thought sometime about the sentence on p. 30, but if you take it literally, you're not allowed to do actions before committing characters. The sentence Silverhand77 also quoted reads "Any player can take actions generally, or between the game steps stated in the rules."
This "or" has to be an exclusive or, and the "take actions generally" applies to the indented green "Player actions" bars, and the "between the game steps" applies to the non-indented green bars. (If it wouldn't be an exclusive or, the "take actions generally" would allow players to do actions before, while and after a game step, and the "between..." part would be totally superfluous.)

So I think Stahlwolle made a good catch, there's a rule missing, in my opinion. The sentence on p. 14 should read "Players have the opportunity to take actions and play event cards before and at the end of each step", as on some other pages in the book (Combat steps), too. And the green bar on p. 30 is also missing that "before". Otherwise, the new event card wouldn't have any purpose.

And this is why there are so many questions... this is such a simple thing that I can't believe people are debating it. Look at the chart in the back of the rulebook.

"Green – Any player can take actions generally, or between the game steps stated in the rules."
"Action windows in which players are free to take actions are presented in green."

The very first part of the quest phase is green. You can take actions at any point here, including "between the game steps as stated in the rules."

"Free to take actions." "can take actions generally." "between the game steps stated in the rules." It's stated in 3 different ways and yet people still try to argue differently.

This is really simple to figure out. Notice how some steps are red, with a green "Player Actions" section after them? That means you can't play anything during the step, but at the end of it you can. If that's what was intended, they would have done that here. They didn't though. They colored the whole step green, allowing the player to take actions. If the player could only take actions after a step resolved, why would we even need the chart?

If you have Necromancer's Pass in the Staging Area (text on card: Travel: The first player must discard 2 cards from his hand at random to travel here.) but you have no cards in hand, do you have to wait until you have at least 2 cards in hand to discard before you can travel there?

I'm guessing so (because that would be hard core). Just curious if there's been a ruling, as I can't find one anywhere.

[And the tragedy of this is that I had no cards in hand and Enchanted Stream as my active location - not allowed to draw cards.  It took 2 extra turns to get enough cards to pay the toll, my staging area blew up, my carefully managed threat meter soared, and enemies came raining down.  Absolutely brutal.]

Thanks!

No need for a ruling, rulebook does well enough:

"Some location cards have travel effects, which are
denoted by a bold “Travel:” trigger on a card. Travel
effects are costs or restrictions that some or all players
must pay or meet in order to travel to that location. If
the players cannot fulfill the requirement of a location’s
travel effect, the players cannot travel to that location." (p. 23)

For presenting a shorter overview, in addition to the rules texts from page 12 to page 22.

Ah, after I understood this, a light went on. Ok, that's a good point :-)  I thought the non-indented bars were green because they consist of several steps, and in between the players can play actions, and that's the sole reason for the non-indented ones being green. This is e.g. the case in the planning phase (play attachment /ally-> possible actions -> play next attachment -> actions -> ...) or with the green combat bars (choose enemy -> possible actions -> declare defender -> actions -> ...). But this is not everywhere the case, committing characters for a player only consists of a single thing. So I can deduce nothing out of intendation, I see that now... Yes, FFG would have made the "commit" step red and add another "Player actions" step if it should be treated like the "Resolve questing" and "Player actions" below.

 

I also thought that the turn sequence on p. 30 is only a short version / overview of p. 12-22 and adds no information to it. This is also wrong, e.g. I can't find the player action window in resource phase on page 12...

But still I'm not quite happy... What's the meaning of indentation? Is the "First player resolves attacks made by enemies against him" bar, which contains many separate steps, considered as a single action window, just because it's green? What's the purpose of the "or between the game steps" without "and before the first step", if it is meant as "between and before"?

Why an extra step for player actions after committing?

If I can play actions before and during committing, why does "Gildor's Council" has a explicit text to be played before committing?

Is it also possible to play "Sneak Attack" to bring allies into play to quest? If it is possible, shouldn't it be named "Sneak Quest" or "Sneak Comit"?

Because once you have committed and move on to the reveal step it will be too late, Gildor's council needs to be played before revealing in order to actually work,

it is possible to use Sneak Attack to bring allies into play to quest, but I don't  think it really matters what the card is called, perhaps just "Sneak" might have been more apt.

My first Warg:

I've searched and been unable to find confirmation about this particular scenario...

Defending against a Warg, I flipped up the shadow card, and it said "Deal X shadow cards to this attacker. X is the number of players in the game."

My first thought was, okay - at least the Warg isn't going back to the Staging Area.

Then (since I'm playing solo) I played 1 more shadow card (for X). The second card had no shadow effect.

So, because this second card had no effect, does the Warg now have to go back to the Staging Area? It would seem so, taking the card as literally as possible, but since the first card did have a shadow effect and it was all part of the same attack, I'm left wondering... thoughts on this?

Thanks.

As shadow effect was resolved (dealt 1 more shadow cart), Warg doesn't return to the staging area and stays engaged with player.

  I think there is no doubt you can play action in quest phase before you commit characters to the quest. On some cards game text mean that.

Than is a good question can we play action after or in between?   I use to play: yes you can after and between. But then in second FAQ they explain all charachters commit to the quest in same time so there is no action in between???Ok  i stop to do that.

So what about can we play action after commit characters to the quest before staging???

If we can play actions after, this change somethings and can allow you to play some combo which i stop to use.  Anyway for now i play actions only  before commit and  again only after staging. but if i can play actions after commit characters to the quest, this make game even more easy with some combo.

So im my opinion this is not clear in the rules or maybe i miss something????

According to this rule we can play actions after committing characters and before staging.

 We are going around and around in circles with this.  Page 14 says you can play stuff at the end of each step.  The timing chart says you can play actions generally.

 

If you can't play actions before committing characters to a quest, Gildor's Council and We Do Not Sleep are unplayable.  To me, that settles the issue entirely.

The chart is there specifically for questions like this. The only place action windows are really defined is in the chart.

From the Rulebook:

"Actions are always optional, and can be triggered by their controller during any action window in the game sequence."

"Actions without a specified phase can be triggered during any action window throughout the round. (See the “Turn Sequence” chart on pages 30-31.)"

During any action window. Used twice in the description of actions. Not "after any action window." It even specifically points players to the chart for reference as to where the action windows are, because they are not listed anywhere else. There are 2 brief mentions of when to play actions elsewhere in the book (one in the quest phase as you mentioned and one in the combat phase). If we were to go by that though and ignore the chart then the only time you could ever play actions is during the quest phase and the combat phases and only after each step. Even the planning phase makes no mention of ever playing events or actions.

I see no problem with a chart detailing this. Trying to describe each and every action window in the text would be wordy and very difficult to follow. The chart does a perfect job at laying the entire thing out in a very easy, readable format.

Nothing against my fellow German LotR-LCG-players, but I have the impression that the discussions on the German Publishers board are less sophisticated than here and often leave an odd impression to me (like people saying: "I know there is a English errata but I play it exactly like it's written on the German card" and other funny stuff).

1. Victory X: Is this cards don't discard to discard pile but put in other "Victory discard pile" and never reshuffle?

2. Sentinel: If I use my sentinel character to defend other player who will gain response on effects like shadow and e.g. Hill Troll or Marsh Adder (e.g. Shadow card is Ungoliant's Spawn, who must raise his threat level?)? Me or other player?

3. Quick Strike: Is it right : "If you use Quick Strike to have one of your own Ranged characters attack an enemy engaged with another player, your other Ranged characters can also join the attack."? According to FAQ other characters can't join this attack.

4. Wolf Rider: If Wolf Rider appears as Shadow effect and was killed during the combat phase, where it should be discarded: to the top of encounter deck (as Shadow effect reads) or to encounter discard pile (according to rules as defeated)?

5. Dol Guldur Orcs: Chosen character must belong to the first player or it could be any character in game (committed to a quest)? As I understand to any players' character.

6. Driven by Shadow: Can Driven by Shadow shadow effect discard Caught in Web? According the FAQ we can't because we don't control it.

7. Goblin Sniper: What if there the only enemies are 2 Goblin Snipers in the staging area?

2 players' game. Journey down the Anduin 3B. I'm the first player and engaged with Hill Troll and my threat level is 49. Hill Troll attacks me and excessive damage = 4, I raise my threat level by 4 and it become 53. I'm eliminated. Next round second player defeats all enemies (including my Troll). We won. Question: what threat level I should put into "Final threat Level" of quest for me? 50, 53 or 54?

Threat level cannot be less then 0 according the rules. So same is here. Cannot be up then 50 i suppose.

I'm reading this unofficial FAQ: www.kaybee.org/kirk/LoTR_LCG_Cards_and_FAQs.pdf [http://www.kaybee.org/kirk/LoTR_LCG_Cards_and_FAQs.pdf] and got few new questions:

1. Victory X: Is this cards don't discard to discard pile but put in other "Victory discard pile" and never reshuffle?

2. Sentinel: If I use my sentinel character to defend other player who will gain response on effects like shadow and e.g. Hill Troll or Marsh Adder (e.g. Shadow card is Ungoliant's Spawn, who must raise his threat level?)? Me or other player?

3. Quick Strike: Is it right : "If you use Quick Strike to have one of your own Ranged characters attack an enemy engaged with another player, your other Ranged characters can also join the attack."? According to FAQ other characters can't join this attack.

4. Wolf Rider: If Wolf Rider appears as Shadow effect and was killed during the combat phase, where it should be discarded: to the top of encounter deck (as Shadow effect reads) or to encounter discard pile (according to rules as defeated)?

5. Dol Guldur Orcs: Chosen character must belong to the first player or it could be any character in game (committed to a quest)? As I understand to any players' character.

6. Driven by Shadow: Can Driven by Shadow shadow effect discard Caught in Web? According the FAQ we can't because we don't control it.

7. Goblin Sniper: What if there the only enemies are 2 Goblin Snipers in the staging area?

 

 

Hi LEGA,

some of your question have been answered already, I'll try to anser the rest of them.

1.) Yes, they're not reshuffled. If they would be reshuffled, the rulebook would instruct you to take note of your victory points per pencil or something like that.

2.) Good question. Never thought of it before though, it seemed to be clear. I think the "defending player" is the player with whom the enemy is engaged. (The player which would be usually defending.) The rulebook only speaks about the "active player" on p. 18, so this is more a guess than a doubt-free statement, but I think in FAQ rule 1.04 the term "defending player" is used in the same sense as I said. And after all, the sentinel is just filling a place which should be filled by a character of the active player, so why should the "defending player" now change.

4.) Due to the Golden Rule, the usual "discard enemy when too much damage tokens are on it" rule doesn't apply, but the wording of the card does. So it should be placed on top of the encounter deck after combat, in my opinion.

5.) Right. Since the only restriction is that the target character has to be committed, also committed characters of other players can be chosen.

6.) Since the effect of "Driven by Shadow" isn't restricted on attachments you control, I'd say FAQ rule 1.06 doesn't change anything, and encounter attachments are also valid targets.

7.) Very good question. The correct answer depends on how duplicate cards are managed (are they regarded as the same card, but as another instance of the card? Or are copies regarded as different cards?) and what exactly the term "other" means (other cards or other instances?). Since I can't find anything about this in the rules, I'd just use common sense and because they're both titled with the same "Goblin Sniper" text, I'd guess that you can engange them.

 

Regards,

Pete

I do not believe you have to apply the Golden Rule here. The wording on the card does not contradict the usual rules for killing an enemy, only what happens at the end of combat. If you kill the wolves they would be placed in the discard pile as usual. When combat ends the attempt to return the wolves to the top of the discard pile fails because they have been removed from play already by a different rule.

You mean, because of the "don't apply Golden rule if there is no direct contradiction"? Right, that's a point, the Golden Rule's not applicable here ;-)

But still, the shadow effect reads "after combat, return Wolf Rider to the top of encounter deck." And I'd say even when Wolf Rider's in the discard pile, you resolve the original shadow effect.

The card is in the discard pile. It is already out of play. Effects cannot interact with a card out of play unless specified otherwise.

Also, check out this FAQ entry.

"(1.02) Simultaneous Effect Timing
If two or more conflicting effects would occur simultaneously, the first player decides the order in which the effects resolve.

Example: Tom plays Sneak Attack (CORE 23) to put Beorn (CORE 31) into play during the combat phase. Sneak Effect has the condition, “At the end of the phase, if that ally is still in play, return it to your hand.” During combat, Tom uses Beorn’s triggered effect, which has the condition, “At the end of the phase in which you trigger this effect, shuffle Beorn back into your deck.” At the end of the phase, a situation arises in which two conflicting effects are attempting to resolve simultaneously on Beorn. The first player determines which of the two effects resolves first. (The second effect no longer applies when Beorn leaves play.)"

Notice how the second effect on Beorn no longer applies because Beorn is out of play? This is a similar situation, except Beorn is leaving play earlier.

You'll end up with a similar situation if you play Gandalf with Sneak Attack. Sneak Attack says to return Gandalf to your hand at the end of the phase and Gandalf's card says to discard him at the end of the round. After he returns to your hand from Sneak Attack, however, the discard effect can no longer apply because he is already out of play. You do not then discard Gandalf from your hand at the end of the round.

## 556 [HilariousPete on November 9, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45639-unoffical-faq-and-suggested-answers-thread/?do=findComment&comment=554070)

You've got a point in the "no interactions from an out of play state" and the leaving-Beorn example. But there are examples when some card effects are still valid while the card is not in play, how can these be explained?

One of these examples is Sneak attack. The sequence is: play the card -> resolve its text (bring Gandalf into play) -> discard the event (rules p. 9). But still at the end of the round, Gandalf is put into a player's hand, because the action of Sneak Attack has already been triggered, even when Sneak Attack itself is in the discard pile.
A similar example is For Gondor, you play the event, then you resolve its text (establishing a new lasting effect which gives the characters +1 attack), then it is discarded. But this lasting effect is valid until the end of the current phase.

Or take Eleanor. Suppose Surge is on the treachery card eleanor is used to cancel. Before the Surge resolves, the when revealed has to resolve (rules p. 24). But we have to use Eleanor's response even before the when revealed effect (otherwise, it wouldn't be of any use). So the first thing to resolve is Eleanor's text. And it states that the original treachery card is discarded. After that, (but before resolving possible When Revealed effects on the new card, according to the new FAQ on page 7) Surge of the old card is executed. But at this point, the original treachery card is already discarded...

Your examples all have one thing in common... the target of the effect has not left play. When playing Sneak Attack or For Gondor the original card that initiated the effect leaves play, but the effect of the cards is on a card that is already in play. Sneak attack specifies that the card played is returned to the owner's hand at the end of the phase. This effect targets the card being played, it does not target Sneak Attack. If you played an ally with Sneak Attack and it died it would go to the discard pile, then when Sneak Attack was supposed to return it to your hand it would fail because the target of the effect is out of play.

Even in the case of Eleanor (which was errata'ed) the target of Surge or Doomed is not the Treachery card that was discarded.

There is a very important difference between the card initiating the effect and the target of an effect. If the target of an effect is not in play then it is not a valid target.

Rulebook about "out of play":
"Card effects do not interact with cards in an out of play state unless the effect specifically refers to that state."

But when the Wolf Rider is flipped, and the shadow effect is resolved, it targets itself, and since it is in play, it also targets a card that is in play. At least, it's in play at the time its shadow effect gets resolved, and the lasting effect initiated. EDIT: and in the Eleanor example (see below), the target has left play

 

Svenn said:

I agree that such an ally isn't returned to my hand, but this is because of the "if the ally is still in play" text on Sneak attack. At the end of the round, neither Sneak Attack nor the ally are in play, but still FFG put the if clause on the card for this case, and this clause is preventing a destroyed character from being taken back into hand in ym opinion, and not the fact that the ally is out of play.

Yes, there is a difference between a card and its target... But in Eleanors case, the original target of eleanor's ability (the cancelled treachery card with the Surge keyword) is also in an out of play state when its Surge is applied.

 

Or did you mean that this has been changed by the erratum? But I think not, the erratum only deals with the new treachery card, that it's revealed and not only replaced, but doesn't say anything about the old Surge...

Or, if I misunderstood you and you wanted to say that Surge or Doomed don't target the Treachery card... yes, but this is the case everytime a Surge occurs...

Yes, Wolf Riders is in play when the effect is initiated but when the resolution of the effect occurs the card is already out of play. The effect cannot resolve because the target of the effect is no longer in play.

Surge and Doomed do not target the treachery card. The treachery card initiates Surge, Doomed, and the When Revealed simultaneously. The effect can still resolve because none of these are targeting the discarded treachery card.

This is exactly the same as the Beorn example. I urge you to re-read that. It says "(The second effect no longer applies when Beorn leaves play.)" If the "if that ally is still in play" part of Sneak Attack was so important this would not be the case. If you triggered the Sneak Attack effect first then the remaining effect is “At the end of the phase in which you trigger this effect, shuffle Beorn back into your deck.” This does not specify "if that ally is still in play" but the example specifies that it still does not trigger because Beorn has left play, so it is not purely a Sneak Attack wording thing.

Ah, now I understand what you mean. The Wolf Rider tries to target itself, and this try is executed (this is the point that I thought you were negating, but you also want to execute it), but it fails, since the Rider itself is out of play and represents no valid target anymore.

So you're basically saying that the "if ... still in play" part of Sneak Attack is not necessary, and has been added only for more clarity? If yes, good from FFG.

If a card uses its name in its text, then it is referring ONLY to that copy of itself, not any other copies with the same name.  If you have 2 Goblin Snipers in the staging area, then each one prevents the other one from being engaged.  You'll need Dunhere, Gandalf, or some other way of getting one out of the staging area to deal with them.

 The rules don't explicity say this, although it is a good principle (otherwise you'd be able to get 9 progress tokens on all locations with 3 northern trackers in play; that's absurd).  Rather than go in to that, however, let's look at the text on Goblin Sniper:

"During the encounter phase, players cannot optionally engage Goblin Sniper if there are other enemies in the staging area."

You cannot engage this enemy if there are other enemies in the staging area.  There is another enemy in the staging area.  The fact that it's another Goblin Sniper is irrelevant.

My apologies since this was its own thread a page back, and I don't think there's any clear answer, but...

Q: How does the Forced effect of quest phase 2B work if Gollum isn't in play?

I think it needs a little bit of errata, but I've been playing it as though if you defeat phase 2B without Gollum in play, you have to reset the quest deck to 1B.  Still, I think there are just way too many possible ways to interpret this (i.e., Gollum has no resource tokens on him since he is in the encounter deck, and is therefore "captured" without having to deal any cards and the scenario won).

As an aside, I also think that Gollum should have errata that reads: "If Gollum is revealed as a shadow card or during an Escape test, put him into the staging area instead and replace him with the next card from the top of the encounter deck."  Having him shuffled back in only to slowly trawl through the encounter deck to make sure you don't accidentally discard him (i.e., cancelling all treacheries, avoiding combats), is awfully tedious.  He ended up being the very bottom encounter card in a two-player game today sad.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sad.gif]

I've got a question related to the Dead Marshes.

If the Encounter Deck is empty, are no cards drawn for Escape Checks? By the rules no, but this can absolutely ruin the Capture of Gollum and make the whole quest no fun at all...so I feel that either the rule about not refreshing the encounter deck, or something in the Dead Marshes needs to be FAQed.

Why? With a reading of all of the rules we have available, you would WANT to complete the quest, as it means you would only have to commit 1 Willpower to the capture check, as no cards would be dealt.

A question that has probably been asked before, but I couldn't find it:

 

1) I trigger Faramir's action at the start of the quest phase.

2) Faramir gets killed by a "when revealed" effect of an encounter card.

 

Do the questing characters still get one additional WP or is Faramir's action lost after his departure?

1. Yes, as it is no committing to a quest.

2. Yes, because "discard from play". In hand is not in play.

I have a question about the hill troll. I was playing a game with a friend yesterday and I think we've played it wrong, but i'm not sure, so can somebody shed some light on this? ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

The card says the following:

Excess combat damage dealt by the Hill Troll (damage that is dealt beyond the remaining hit points of the character damaged in the attack) must be assigned as an increase to you threat.

If I assing him to gimli who has 2 wounds and who has 2 defence and 5 vitality, does he he get 2 extra wounds until he is almost dead and does the rest of the damage go to threat or does he die and and then you assign the threat?

Thanks

Hill Troll attacks for 6, minus 2 for Gimli's defense, leaving 4 dmg to deal (assuming you meant Gimli defends against the HT; undefended attacks don't deduct defense). Since Gimli already has 2 wounds in your example, three dmg is enough to kill him, the fourth dmg instead goes to your threat. If you defend against the Hill Troll with a 0 defense, 1 hitpoint character, your threat goes up 5.

Question about Journey to Rhosgobel:

Say you are at Quest Card 2B with X number of progress tokens on it.

It is the Quest Phase.
The active location is guarding an Athelas.
Your heroes have not collected any other Athelas.
Wilyador has anywhere from 1-5 wounds.
One of your questing heroes has Protector of Lórien.
As you are questing, you have enough cards in your hand to use actions via PoL to make enough progress to clear both the active location (guarding the Athelas) and complete Quest Card 2B.

When you place the progress tokens on the active location to fully explore it (freeing the Athelas card), is there time to make the action with an unexhausted hero to exhaust that hero to claim the Athelas before placing the final remaining progress tokens on Quest Card 2B (triggering the move to Quest Card 3 ~ which no matter what is the end of the game)?

## 583 [HilariousPete on December 17, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45639-unoffical-faq-and-suggested-answers-thread/?do=findComment&comment=568712)

I don't think so. The crucial thing is that you can get Athelas by an action, not by an response, so I can't see a chance. The timing sequence published up to now is the following:

 * After revealing all encounter cards, you use the PoL's action in the action window before quest resolution to pump up your willpower. You can't claim Athelas since it's yet guarded.

Then there's the quest resolution. It's red, so you can't play actions in it:

 * First, you have "sucessfully quested" and can/must do responses/forced effects which refer to successfully questing. (Not the case in your example.) But no actions allowed.
 * Secondly, you place progress tokens on the active location. In your example, you discard the guarding location as it is explored. You still don't have the possibility to do actions.
 * Then you place the remaining tokens on the quest. You have to advance to the next quest stage, because of p. 22 ("Players immediately advance to the next stage of a quest as soon as they place a number of progress tokens..."). In your example, the game will be lost at this point.
 * Now the questing would count as resolved (possibly triggering responses/forced effects), if the game wasn't finished.
 * And only now you have the ability to do actions. (Nate French clarified this in the Escort from Edoras / Born Aloft (and similar combos) question.) But it's already too late...

juicebox said:

You're welcome.

But I have some rules questions on my owngui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif], perhaps you or someone else can solve them? IIRC, they aren't answered in the LotR rules or FAQ, but if anyone has experience in CoC or AGoT, I'd also like to accept answers from these games very much, since I think the mechanics are somehow similar...

1) Because of "Shadows of the Past", encounter discard pile order is important now. In HfG quest card 1B, when I have to discard 2 of the 3 cards, may I choose the order of the 2 cards? Or do I have to preserve the original card draw order?
Likewise, when the remaining shadow cards after combat are discarded, what's the proper order here?

2) How long do treachery cards and event cards stay in play - until the last bit of their text is fully resolved, or do the physical cards leave play just after playing them but their ongoing effects (e.g. then "return to hand at the end of the phase" of "Sneak Attack", or the +1 AS and +1 DS of "Blade Mastery") stay effective? The rulebook tells us on page 9 that an event card is played from hand, then its effects are resolved, and then it gets discarded. But does this mean that they are discarded after they are fully resolved, or that they are discarded just after the resolution started?
Initially, I played it the second way (see question 3 about rules p. 14 for the reason), but this would mean that card effects can exist seperately from the physical cards they're printed on, and the more I think about it, the stranger it seems, because "Dunedain Mark" obviously loses its effect on its attached hero after it has been discarded by e.g. "Driven by Shadow", so the card effect should be bound to the existence (in play) of the card... And another point is, why do shadow cards remain on their enemies until the combat phase is finished. And perhaps the text on p. 9 supports the "until fully resolved" version better, too...

3) So if the answer to 2) would be "they stay in play until the last bit of their text is resolved", there are some other questions:

Is such a game effect "re-evaluated"? E.g. with "Treacherous Fog" in a game with 3 players: 1st encounter card is a location, 2nd is Treacherous Fog, 3rd is another location: do both locations get the +1? And when do players have to discard 1 card (if their threat is >= 35): at the end of the quest phase, or at the moment the Treacherous Fog is revealed?
And how does the sentence "encounter cards are revealed one at a time, with any when revealed effects being resolved before the next card is revealed" (rules p. 14) fit into the scheme, because the When Revealed effect of Treacherous Fog can only be fully resolved at the end of quest phase, so after all other encounter cards are drawn, and this would mean a deadlock, if the rules are to be taken literally... Or is the meaning of this rules sentence that the resolution of the When Revealed effect is only started before the next encounter card is drawn? Though this would favour my initial answer to question 2) again... Argh, now I'm argumenting in circles gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif] Can you help?

4) Does anyone know of a rules answer from FFG wether an eliminated player can be brought back in the game via "Fortune or Fate"? (This thread here [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=528322]  makes a good point that it is not possible, but I don't know if there has been a ruling from FFG meanwhile.)

5) Since Landroval's response is worded "after a hero card is destroyed", does the hero count as destroyed/eliminated for a short time? (I suppose yes.) If yes, this would mean two things: First, the hero loses all his attachments and tokens (except the 1 dmg token which is put on him because of Landroval's text) and sencond, if question 4) has been answered "no bringing back of players" Landroval can't be used to resurrect the last hero of a player, since the player is already considered eliminated in the meantime because all his heroes have been out of play for a short time. Correct?

1) Never heard of that card, is it from return to Mirkwood?

 

2) + 3)  I usually resolve their effect and discard them right afterwards. However,  I keep cards like "Treacherous Fog" until the end of the quest phase to reminde me to add the additional threat. TF only affects those locations that are already in the staging area when the card is played, as it is a "when revealed" effect. And that's also why it affects every player exactly in the moment the card is revealed.

Regarding the shadow cards, I think the only card that is affected by the rule that the cards have to stay in play until the combat phase is over is the "Wolf Rider". That way you can attack him before he gets placed at the top of the encounter deck. At least i cannot think of any other card where i would maka difference (which is why I discard them immediatly, depsite the rules).

4) + 5) I never thought about that, but I guess this is how I'd play it - player eliminated = point of no return.

1- I just answered this one above; I think First Player chooses.

(For my remaining answers, I'm borrowing a bit from my AGoT knowledge - I know they're not the same, but I imagine the answers and the justifications for them will be similar.)

2 - Treachery and Event cards are discarded as soon as they're played.  Usually they create effects that are lasting ("until the end of the round", for example), but that lasting effect doesn't require that the card be in play.  I think the comparison to Dunedain Mark, an attachment, is not the best comparison.  Attachments are active as long as they are attached.  Events are active for as long as they say they are.  There's no need for them to remain in play for their effects to occur. Also, the rules as written don't support events staying in play for a long period of time.

3 - This is largely a moot point, but no, game effects are NOT re-evaluated.  In your example: Card 1 - location. Card 2 - Treacherous Fog.  At this point, Card 1 gets +1 threat. Anyone with >35 threat discards.  At this point, Treacherous Fog is fully resolved. Card 3 - location.  This card does NOT get +1 threat.

4 - I believe that Fortune and Fate cannot bring back an eliminated player.

5 - I do believe that Landroval CAN prevent a player from being eliminated - you have to view Responses as part of the resolution of any player action or game action.  By the time that action has fully resolved (responses and all), the player still has a hero in the game.  (I could be wrong about this one, but I do think that you have to allow for Responses to occur before checking to see if a player is eliminated.)

@leptokurt:

To 1): Yes, "Shadows of the Past" is from RtM.

2) and 3): I don't think this has to do something with the trigger type (since the trigger only tells me when a card effect has to be / can be initiated, but doesn't tell me if the card effect is a lasting effect or not). But after your and radiskull's AGoT-inspired answers, I suppose FFG wants event+treachery cards also to be discarded just after they're played, and only their effects staying active. This would favour no re-evaluating of the card effect, because re-evaluating a card which is already out of play seems a bit strange to me, so I think your answer "the 2nd location doesn't get +1 WS" is still valid

4) You and radiskull agree, so no problem here ;-)

5) You don't agree with radiskull, but if I got his line of argueing right (see my response below), I think I want to agree with him.

1)  The "discarded at same time" argument sounds good. Transforms the ordering problem to a timing problem. Of course the wording of LotR FAQ rule  1.02 will have to be altered to also include non-conflicting simultaneous effect timing for this. But I guess this is just a matter of time until FFG does this, since there will come up more of these questions where 2 things happen at the same time and they're not really conflicting, but will have different results... Take e.g. MADG0BLIN's question.

2) Ok, good to know the AGoT way of dealing with this. So card effects can exist without their originial card being in play... I'll stick with my initial way then.

5) I just downloaded the AGoT FAQ. I'm refering to the timing structure on p. 15 on the lower left. So your point is that Landroval's response can be triggered and resolved in step number 5, and the check wether a player is eliminated only appears after the complete handling of the current action (step number 6), yes?

That would again mean that the rescued hero loses his attachments and resource tokens (I think this would happen in step 3 as part of the action resolution), correct?

Wow, I just discovered the flow charts of the timing structure on p. 18,  really nice :-)

That makes of course sense, technically. As this is my first LCG and you're the more seasoned player, I guess you're probably right (although I feel that a response makes no sense when the player is already eliminated. I also read Landroval's text so that he intervenes after the hero has already been defeated and the player has been eliminated from the game).

Guess you have t be a lawyer to interprete the nuances of timing in this game. gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]

5) I just downloaded the AGoT FAQ. I'm refering to the timing structure on p. 15 on the lower left. So your point is that Landroval's response can be triggered and resolved in step number 5, and the check wether a player is eliminated only appears after the complete handling of the current action (step number 6), yes?

That would again mean that the rescued hero loses his attachments and resource tokens (I think this would happen in step 3 as part of the action resolution), correct?

Wow, I just discovered the flow charts of the timing structure on p. 18,  really nice :-)



 

Those timing charts are EXACTLY what this game desperately needs to be taken seriously as an LCG, in my opinion.  You are thinking through this the same way as I am - Landroval would trigger in step 5, and step 6 the dead hero would leave the table, ending the game for the unfortunate player.  (If we want to take the AGoT timing thing further, here's how Landroval's ability would be worded in that game: "Response: If a hero card would be destroyed, return Landroval to his owner's hand to instead discard all resource tokens, attachments, and damage tokens from that hero. Put one damage token on that hero. (Limit once per game.)"  I also think that Landroval would be worded as a "save" effect, but that's neither here nor there.)

So far, the only major rules difference I've seen between this game and AGoT are regarding attachments. (In AGoT, A Burning Brand would be discarded if the attached character lost the Lore icon, and playing an attachment on an opponents character does not grant them control of it.)  I'm inclined to think that when it comes to timing, AGoT is a good guide for us.

That makes of course sense, technically. As this is my first LCG and you're the more seasoned player, I guess you're probably right (although I feel that a response makes no sense when the player is already eliminated. I also read Landroval's text so that he intervenes after the hero has already been defeated and the player has been eliminated from the game).

Guess you have t be a lawyer to interprete the nuances of timing in this game. gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]



That makes sense, but you have to remember that Responses are able to be triggered before an action has completely resolved (otherwise Eleanor's ability is pointless, for example).

I have few simple questions:

If shadow card have effect to discard 1 attachment from defending character/player and he has only Caught in Web, should it be discarded? If it is not only 1 attachment? According from FAQ 1.06 it shouldn't. But if card effect says to discard all attachments?

4) Does anyone know of a rules answer from FFG wether an eliminated player can be brought back in the game via "Fortune or Fate"? (This thread here [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=528322]  makes a good point that it is not possible, but I don't know if there has been a ruling from FFG meanwhile.)

Nate has made an official ruling according to this thread [http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/735929/question-about-card-fortune-of-fate-received-an] on BGG:

There's a big difference between "discard 1 attachment you control" and "discard 1 attachment".  If it's the former, you can't discard Caught in a Web (as you pointed out, 1.06 says you don't control it).  If it's the latter, you certainly can, since it's still an attachment.

The crucial part is not whether Caught in a Web is the only attachment on someone, but whether the shadow card makes the distinction between discarding attachments you control, or discarding any attachment.

I like your version much better than the real card ;-) First, it's "if a hero would be destroyed" and not "after", which was the word that started me to think that Landroval can't be used to save the last hero. And second, it specifies on losing attachments and tokens.

Perhaps around/after Christmas I'll have some time to look at the timing structure of AGoT more detailed. As you said, I guess before a timing structure for LotR is published, this will serve as a fine replacement.

But while skimming through AGoT FAQ, I found another difference to LotR, next to the attachment requirements you mentioned: targets. A target requires the word "choose" to really be a target in AGoT ( FAQ p. 12). The usage of targets on LotR's "Dry Watercourse" seems different, when considering the wording of "Gollum's Bite"...

As we have 2 cards with such effect we can say that:

1) Driver by Shadow a) defeated attack - we can discard Caught in Web, b) undefeated - we can't because there specified "you control";

2) Cavern Guardian - we can't because there specified "you control" in both cases.

Right?

I believe attachments are locked to a character, unless they contain text such as 'pay X resource' to move from one character to another.

Otherwise you would be able to overload one character with attachments, have them do their action, then give all those attachments to the next character, etc.

What happens if an enemy engages with an other player during its attack? (for example if "Son of Arnor" is played by "Sneak Attack" or "Stand and Fight" after an other player choosed that enemy to attack him)

Does it cancel the enemy's attack oder is the enemy still attacking (if the attack is not canceled which player would get the damage, the player choosed the enemy to attack him, or the player how is engaged with this enemy after player "Son of Arnor"?)

If I read your question correctly:

Son of Arnor's response allows you to engage an enemy that's either in the staging area, or engaged with another player.
So let me draw up a scenario and see if anyone else agrees with this.

 

Player 1 is engaged with a single enemy, during the start of the combat phase.

Player 1 declares the attack undefended

Player 2 jumps in, bringing in Son of Arnor through "Sneak Attack" or "Stand and Fight", drawing the enemy engaged with Player 1 to himself.

Player 1 now has no enemies engaged with him. Combat phase for Player 1 resolves.

Over to player 2,

Player 2 now has the additional enemy engaged with him, who will attack as normal.

 

If that's true, then is this true:

 

Player 1 is engaged with no enemies, Player 2 is engaged with a single enemy.

Combat phase begins.

Player 1's combat phase resolves, as he has no enemies.

Player 2 declares the attack undefended against the single enemy.

Player 1 jumps in, bringing in Son of Arnor through "Sneak Attack" or "Stand and Fight", drawing the enemy engaged with Player 2 to himself.

Player 2's combat phase resolves, as he now has no enemies engaged with him.

Resolution occurs for both players, and due to the enemy switching engaged players the enemy has not attacked.

Would this phase resolve and move on to the 'refresh' phase? Or would another round of the combat phase begin, seeing as an eligible enemy has not had its attack.

if you sneak or stand Sons of Arnor AFTER your own defence phase, then it is a similar effect to feint, as in you stop the card from attacking... it works like this...

1) Player 1 dose his entire combat defense phase, it is now player 2's turn.

2) Player 2 reveals his shadow cards

3) Player 1 sneaks or stands Arnor. This brings the enemy from player 2's engagement area to player 1s engagement area before the card resolved its attack to player 2.

so that is how the event is to be played, and what has happened is that the card has been pulled to player 1's side BEFORE it attacks, but Player 1 has already complete combat defense phase (were the monster attacks)... so there is no opportunity for the monster to attack player 1. This effectively has removed the monsters attack phase, like say a feint.

The card that is most similar to this is "A Light in the Dark" witch also move a monsters location during the attack phase to stop it from having eligible attack.

You could add a mechanism that you would have to pay for the card again. That way you counter that. I used to play Decipher's TCG and there you could transfer it to an other eligible character if you payed the cost again.

But that's not the case here so I'll pay better attention on who I play what. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

 I have a question. When encounter cards are revealed during the quest phase, how many do you reveal if one player was eliminated during the previous round in a two-player game? Is it one because there is only one player left, or is it two because the game is still a two-player game even if one was eliminated? I searched the forums and didn't see the answer, though I suppose the search function can only do so much.

 Sometimes it´s easier to search the rulebook than the forum. The answer to this can be found on page 22 of the rulebook.



Player Elimination

A player is eliminated from the game if all of his heroes are killed, if his threat level reaches 50, or if a card effect forces his elimination. (Future expansion scenarios may have threat elimination levels at values other than 50; for all of the scenarios included in the core set, a player is eliminated when his threat level reaches 50.)

When a player is eliminated, his hand, all of the cards he controls, and his deck are placed in their owners’ discard piles. Any encounter cards with which that player was engaged are returned to the staging area, retaining any wound tokens that have been placed on them. The remaining players continue to play the game. Note that after a player is eliminated, one less card is revealed from the encounter deck during the staging step of the quest phase, as there is now one less player involved in the game.

Thanks. Good point about the rule book.

So if your friend is completely eliminated from the game, you can't bring any heroes of his back and put him back in the game? It seems like you can't because all his cards are in his discard pile so he'd have nothing to work with. But if the discard pile is still there, you could still resurrect cards from his discard pile with Stand and Fight and such, right?

The 'A Light in the Dark' sends enemies back to the Staging Area; and since the Engagement Phase of this round would have already passed they are unable to attack.

In my previous examples the enemy is still engaged with a player, except they are bouncing back between players through card effects. As far as I was concerned I considered the enemy to still be eligible for attack, but couldn't attack as it had 'missed its chance' to attack. The ruleblook clearly shows each player getting one combat turn each, so that should suffice to clarify.

Worth noting none-the-less. Cheers.

Picked up The Hunt for Gollum today, played through it a couple times. Seems a little overly easy so far, but more challenging quests await me later. A few questions I had while playing it:

1) Never mind. This one actually doesn't need to be answered, I just double-checked the FAQ. I was curious if I needed to perform the Forced on 1B before moving on to the 2B; the FAQ clears that up, even using that exact example. I was playing it that way anyway, so alrighty.

2) During one of my games, the two encounter cards I drew at the beginning of a quest phase in 2B were the last cards in the deck. The card I picked to reveal had Surge. I shuffled the deck and drew the first card to complete Surge; was this the right thing to do? I assume so, as the rulebook says the deck is to shuffled anytime during the quest phase if it is empty, but I paused to consider it as it was in the middle of another effect. How about if I had had only one card left in the deck? Would I have drawn the remaining card, shuffled, drawn the new first card, and picked one to reveal, or would I have only had the remaining card to choose from?

this is a wired rule imo, but you only shuffle the discard pile back into the encounter deck during the quest phase when you reveal more cards... so ANY other time.. if you run out of cards then you do not shuffle. In the case for the scrying in HFG, if you can only pull 1 card, I play that it has to go onto the staging area, if in 1b you can only pull 2 cards, then just choose 1

Is there a more detailed ruling on shuffling the encounter deck than what's in the rulebook? "If the encounter deck is ever empty during the quest phase, the encounter discard pile is shuffled and reset back into the encounter deck." That doesn't say anything about needing to reveal cards.

So if I'm doing Journey Down the Anduin, and I'm on 3B where I'm skipping the staging step, would I then not need to reset the deck if it were empty?

Another question, want to confirm I've been doing this right. Enemies that are engaged to me but cannot attack me--Forest Snare--should still be getting dealt a Shadow card, correct? But the Shadow card will have no effect, correct?

Well, you are in fact correct, I have been shuffling the discard back in during the reveal step of the quest phase, as that is when i notice the deck is empty... but yea.. you do it when you are in quest phase, so technically that means as soon as you start the quest phase, before you have even committed characters I guess. So even if you are not revealing cards to the staging area cause of that effect you should still shuffle back in before the combat phase. This has not come up for me, but it is how I would play it if it did.

Yes, you still deal shadow cards to all cards in combat, regardless of it they can not attack. So a snared beast gets shadow cards, and they are instantly discarded.

Also note that if you run out of cards during the shadow card phase then they are simple NOT dealt to the enemies.. you do not shuffle back in

That can't be right... I've always played that you just shuffle the encounter deck any time it is empty, regardless of what phase. It seems silly to be able to skip shadow effects just because you haven't reshuffled the deck yet.

That can't be right... I've always played that you just shuffle the encounter deck any time it is empty, regardless of what phase. It seems silly to be able to skip shadow effects just because you haven't reshuffled the deck yet.

I watched the tutorial video a number of times after getting the game, just to make sure I was following the rules.

Only now have I noticed that Eowyn's card readies without reason during the combat phase of the tutorial.

It's amazing how much you can miss no matter how many times you read / watch something :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

yes, but I am not sure there are any yet, like HFG for example and JTR both have quest card effects that can scry teh encounter deck.. but you can not trigger them untill the quest phase starts, so as far as i know.. the only time you tun out of encounter cards and it dosn't matter is during the time you deal shadow cards.

Sent 4 rules questions to FFG. Thx Nate French for quick answers!

Questions:

1) Are objectives also encounter cards? (E.g. can a ready Elfhelm help against Gollum in RTM?)
2) Is a negative threat possible?
3) Who's the "defending player" in case a character with Sentinel keyword defends for another player: the player who controls the defending character=sentinel, or the player who is engaged with the enemy?
4) The quest card "The Hunt Begins" 1B tells the first player to discard 2 out of 3 encounter cards. May the first player decide the order (e.g. which of the 2 cards is on top of the encounter discard pile)? That's important because of "Shadow of the Past"...

Answers:

1) Objective cards are considered encounter cards.

2) No, threat cannot be reduced below 0.

3) The player engaged with the enemy is still the defending player, a character with sentinel is merely a defending character.

4) Yes, the first player may discard the 2 cards in any order.

Correct. There is no encounter deck to affect until the next quest phase. So, a card like Denethor or Henamarth Riversong would effectively not be able to use its ability if the encounter deck were to run out of cards during the combat phase.

I played my newly bought Hunt for Gollum yesterday for the first time and I won with 163 points.  Not sure if I did it correctly though. The first quest card says:

Setup: Reveal 1 card per player from the encounter deck, and add it to the staging area.
Forced: After the players quest successfully, the first player looks at the top 3 cards of the encounter deck. Reveal and add 1 of those cards to the staging area, and discard the other 2 cards.

The Forced part, if you look at the 3 cards and one is an enemy, one is a location and one is a treachery when revealed effect card. Can I choose the treachery when revealed card? Or can I not because you cannot add it to the staging area?

And when I draw 3 when revealed cards does that mean I just discard them? Or can you choose a treachery when revealed card ?

Thanks again!

If I attach the card Unexpected Courage to a hero can I use that ability to attack twice?

The card says:
Action: Exhaust Unexpected Action to ready attached hero.

So I attack and exhaust, I exchaust Unexpected Action, ready the hero and attack again. Is this allowed? I would say so, but just to be sure. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 When I pull an Objective card like the Clue from Hunt for Gollum as a shadow card do I add it to the staging area or put it into the encounter discard pile? I've been unsure how to handle it, so I've been just shuffling it back into the encounter deck and pulling another shadow card instead.

On BGG there is a listing of combos.  One of the combos is using Wandering Took to block an attack, see the Shadow Card, then choose to give control of the Took to another player so that Gloin could take the damage undefended.  Reading through the rules I was not convinced that the Wandering Took changing player control would remove it from combat.  Anyone have a good answer on that?

I fail to see why Wandering Took becomes an illegal defender. The legality of the defender is checked after you declare your defenses.

He is still in play, thus able to take damage and etc.

 

If he was gone out of play (like discarded by taking damage before the resolution of the attack or returned to your hand) I'd understand.

 

I might be wrong, though. That's my 2 cents.

I felt the same way cordeirooo, and so went looking for answers.  I am not the best with rules for the game since I play irregularly.  As a similar example I would feel that if a Hero received the Sacked! condition they would not remove themselves from the current quest if they were questing at the time it was revealed, however they would be unable to declare a quest action until the condition was removed.

I just got Conflict at Carrock and Journey to Rhosgobel earlier this week, and I'm looking forward to sitting down and trying out both quests now that I have some free time. I was curious though about how Frodo works, or more generally how much damage is dealt to a character.

Frodo's text is Response: After Frodo Baggins is damaged, cancel the damage and instead raise your threat by the amound of damage he would have been dealt. (Limit once per phase.)  If something hits Frodo for more than his 2 hit points, is he taking all that damage, or just the two damage it would take to kill him? Hummerhorns, for instance, engage me, and I assign the 5 damage they deal to Frodo. Obviously I'd use his Response, but how much was he damaged for? Is my threat going up by 2 or 5?

More generally, is a character dealt the full brunt of any damage done to them? Given that both Hill Trolls and Cave Trolls (and maybe some others) have abilities that depend on excess damage, it seems like a character only takes as much damage as they have hit points and defense.

 I am interested in this as well.  I believe if the Hill Troll were to hit Frodo with a strength of 6, two would go to defense and the other 4 to threat. The only exception I could possibly see, is 3 to threat and 1 hit on Frodo.  You would have to have to account for the damage still residing somewhere. Ha! I don't know if that makes sense.  The Hummerhorn with 5 strength, 2 to Frodo's defense, then 2 to threat and 1 to Frodo.  If you were only to put 2 into threat, then the excess strength would still be forced to wound, it wouldn't disappear.  I'm not sure if any of this is right though... just speculating....

P18 of the rulebook

Combat damage is defined as attack strength - defence strength. So you calculate the damage before you check to see if it is more than hit points etc for Frod's ability, so in the case of hummerhorns, threat would go up by 5 in the example you gave (when they engage).

Tried out Conflict at Carrock tonight, had a couple of questions.

1) Muck Adder attacks me, I have Frodo take the damage, and raise my threat. I do not need to discard Frodo, correct? Because his ability says "cancel the damage," so Frodo was not actually damaged?

2) Roasted Alive is still shuffled back into the encounter deck, even if there is no hero to destroy? It's a then, so the first part needs to resolve completely, but when no one is Sacked, destroying no heroes is the same as destroying all heroes with Sacked.

3) The Carrock's immunity to player card effects is, I assume, pretty much absolute. Can't add progress to it through Lorien Guide or Northern Tracker or Snowborn Scout, can't ignore its threat through Secret Paths? Are there any effects that can affect it, even indirectly? The only one I can think of that might work, at least among the cards I currently own, is Strider's Path -- as that card effect is targeting a just reveal location, I assume I could use it to get The Carrock back to the staging area.

Here's my take:

1) I agree.  Since the damage was canceled, no one was "damaged".

2) It's true its a then.  The only way it would fail is if there was a hero with Sacked! who didn't get destroyed.  "Destroy all heroes with the card Sacked! attached" could legitimately affect zero heroes. I'd say it gets reshuffled in that case.

3) I think it's pretty much absolute.  Secret Paths tells you to choose it, so that's out.  Strider's Path is an interesting example since The Carrock is only indirectly affected, as a part of the resolution of a different effect, and I'd be inclined to allow it, but I would check with Nate.

The Carrock location also says: "Players cannot travel to The Carrock except through quest card effects." So that seems as absolute as it can get. Even without that statement the "Immune to player card effects." would rule out the card effect from Strider's Path.

.
 
Thanks for keeping this FAQ thread going! Here are a few suggested clarifications.

Multiple places: Quick Strike card title is two words not QuickStrike.

> -----------Quest Phase - Core
> 3. If a location in the staging area has enough progress tokens on it (from the Northern tracker for instance), is it immediately removed from play, or does it still have to be made an active location, before it is removed?
> 
> It is removed from play as soon as it has enough tokens on it. Any suplus go onto the quest as normal.

Edit: Remove last sentence. Surplus tokens from locations in Staging Area do not go onto the quest card.

> 22. What does "eligible enemy target" mean on the Quick Strike card?
> 
> Eligible means "If it was the Combat Phase and you could normally declare that character as an attacker against that enemy." That would mean only Dunhere can attack Enemies in Staging and Ranged characters could attack Enemies engaged with other players. Other characters would have to attack Enemies engaged with you. (Thanks to Apophenia for this concisely worded answer)


Edit: Rewrite first sentence as "Eligible enemy targets are those your characters could normally attack (declare as targets) during the Combat Phase. But Quick Strike can also be used in any action window outside of the Combat Phase."
I would also remove the word "only" since there may be other ways in the future besides Dunhere.

Time to revive this thread :-)

I sent 2 questions to FFG, and got answers from Caleb Grace (in a timely manner, thanks!):

 

Q: When (at which substep of an attack) does "Striking Tentacle" 's forced effect trigger? Before step 2, and just preventing the declaration of a defender, or somewhen after step 2 (so I will want to declare a defender and when the attack is undefended, I also have exhausted that character in vain)

A: The forced effect triggers when it attacks, so that would happen in Step 1, before declaring defenders.

Q: When a hero is shuffled into my deck because of "Lost and Alone" and shall be attached to a Nameless enemy, is it possible? If yes, is his cost considered 0 or do I have to use his threat cost?

A: Yes it is possible. Heroes do not have cost, so it would count as 0.

Well, although the answer is sound and consistent with Dol Guldur Beastmaster Forced effect, "When it attacks" trigger is not necessarily applied in step 1. Snow Wargs, for instance, deal damage to decleared defender when they attack, thus their effect has to apply at step 2. I would say "When X attacks" applies as early as possible during the Enemy attack sequence.

What happens when troll purse or troll key(hobbit scenario) is dealt as a shadow card? Is it dicarded or put into the staging area?

The only thing that applies to shadow cards is the shadow effect. So if the shadow effect does not say "add this card to the staging area", they are discarded.

Yes, they are discarded. And then the Official FAQ text kicks in and they are placed back into the staging area. Then if any trolls are present they get attached to a troll.
