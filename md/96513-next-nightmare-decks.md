Some may have missed this (what with the cycle preview), but there is a news article revealing the next Nightmare decks:

Its strange, the article doesn't show on the FFG homepage, but does if you click on "News"

 

Anyway, the next Nightmare decks are for The Hobbit: Underhill and Overhill!  I for one found them quite hard enough as they were!

Sorry I just saw this was already mentioned in another thread...
