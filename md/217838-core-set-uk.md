I just came to this forum to find out exactly the same thing!! No availability in the UK at the moment. It looks like its out of stock on this site as well so maybe theirs new stock being printed? Hopefully that will get sent over to the UK as well. Looking forward to getting into this game.

I've seen it in stock at both Waterstones and forbidden planet stores in the last couple of weeks, in Birmingham and Stoke on Trent.

When I don't order online I get my LotR stuff from Travelling Man. The one in Newcastle is pretty erratic in what they keep in stock, and I haven't been in recently, but they do tend to have Core Sets as I recall.

You could try some shops stationed in Belgium or the Netherlands. You won't be obliged to pay import duties. 
I guess the pound-euro-rate is in your favour.

 

I don't know if I'm allowed to paste links to shops on these forums, but I'll go with it.

Good luck on finding yourself a coreset!
