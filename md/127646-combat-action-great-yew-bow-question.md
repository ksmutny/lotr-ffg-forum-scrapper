as this is a combat action, can I use great yew bow during an early attack before the combat phase?

like hands on the bow or during an enemy makes an immediate attack after revealed from the encounter deck?

Since it is a combat action, you can only use it during the Combat phase, so you wouldn't be able to use it during the Quest phase, etc.

so, any attack outside the regular combat phase will not initiate any additional combat phase?

I mean...there is no additional combat phase for an early attack?

Correct, there are no additional combat phases.  The only time you can use "combat actions" are during the actual combat phase where normal attacks happen.
