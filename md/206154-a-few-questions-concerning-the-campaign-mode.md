Good day to all.

 

Tomorrow I'm about to delve into the LotR saga for the very first time. A quick glimpse at the campaign rules inevitably raised a few questions:

 

Noble Hero [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/lord-of-the-rings-saga-expansions/the-black-riders/noble-hero-tbr?st=0#comment_55333]

 

Per the rules and since this attachment is permanent, if the hero benefiting from it leaves play, this one is removed from the game.

 

1. Does "removed from the game" also mean "removed from the campaign log"?

 

2. What happens if, during the same game that the hero left play, it returns, i.e. by FoF? Does the attachment return attached to him?

 

Leaf-wrapped Lembas [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/lord-of-the-rings-saga-expansions/the-road-darkens/leaf-wrapped-lembas-r1221?st=0#comment_55332]

 

3. What happens to attachments such as this one if they are discarded due to an encounter card effect before I get the chance to use them? Are they removed from the campaign pool as if I had used them?

 

Many thanks.

1. No. I do not think so.

 

2. No.  If you played another scenario after winning, it would return to the hero, though.

 

3. They will just be discarded. No.
