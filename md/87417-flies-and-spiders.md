Okay. I just do not understand how to play this quest. For some reason, even after reading the Hobbit On the Doorstep pamphlet and quest card 2 a hundred times, I just don't know how to do the transition of splitting up the players. So the first player takes quest card 3 and makes his own staging area. I get that. But when quest card 2 says "Reveal stage 3 and make a separate staging area for the first player using that stage," does that mean EVERY character gets unconcious? Or only the first player's characters?

Only the first player´s characters get unconcious (except Bilbo). The other players (if there are any) go to stage 4 to fight the spiders.

Okay. Thanks for that clarification. That last scenario did not go very well, and now I know why.  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
