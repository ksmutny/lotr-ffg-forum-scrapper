How does the game handle simultaneous actions? I know there's been some debate on the Aragorn/Theodred interaction, but I'm thinking about Beorn/Sneak Attack. If you use Sneak Attack to bring Beorn into play, attack with him triggering his Action to get +5 attack, which effect triggers at the end of the phase? Does he go to your hand or get shuffled back in? Would you be able to choose which one to process?

This is actually in the FAQ thread.  The official response is that the player decides - so yes, the Aragorn-Theodred combo works.

Is that the same ruling for the Beorn/Sneak Attack?
