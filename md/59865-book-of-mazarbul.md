After seeing english spoilers, I was assuming that the hero who holds Book Of Mazarbul can quest , but will not get exhausted. So in other words you get "free" quester while Book is in play.

However, the translated card (english -> polish) says that hero CAN'T exhaust to quest.

How the card should be played? Is it just translation issue or maybe I was reading the card wrong previously?

No, you did it right and the Polish translation seems wrong: The attached hero can quest but does not exhaust to do so. Beside this advantage, the book doesn't do anything for the quest anyway.
