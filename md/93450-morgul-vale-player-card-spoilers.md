Thanks for posting!

 

Very, very nice overall. Gondor got "only" that one boost card but it is a good one. And the Leadership ally is okay, if a bit repetitive in its function (similar to Errand-rider and Envoy of Pelargir).

 

When the Black Riders came out, I was happy to have Dagger of Westernesse for Dúnhere, now he gets his proper weapon, it is very similar but more thematic (and even better in most of the cases with Dúnhere).

 

I think we have the "cavalry" mechanics you were mentioning, Rich, here with "Forth Éorlingas". I mean their take on it...

 

I do not understand the Dwarf ally. First I would half expected such an effect with Spirit (where Emery utterly shines) but with Lore? I am probably missing a combo here, but the effect seems quite bad (but the stats are solid, if not on par with Hammersmith).

 

Then comes the Cache, it is meant to combo with the above, I see. It seems rather situational but it is nice to have an event that can be used in one of two ways - first of the kind, I believe.

## 3 [ana4 on November 13, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93450-morgul-vale-player-card-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=907766)

ps: Pelargir Ship Captain can basically replace Guard of the Citadel (I've used to run him up till now for the lack of Gondor Leadership allies), he is the same with the response (he lacks the Warrior trait, not that it matters for now, hopefully soon).

## 4 [ana4 on November 13, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93450-morgul-vale-player-card-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=907770)

Okay, one more from me, sorry, the initial excitement is usually too great to resist.

 

I am thinking about the Ered Nimrais Prospector. He could of course go rather nicely with the Hidden Cache and Gildor Inglorion, but it is hard to set up. A good thing about the response (which you of course need not trigger) is that it shuffles the deck; this is becoming increasingly important in my mono-Lore decks, and it will be great for Scroll of Isildur - which puts the event onto the bottom of the deck. If you have a really strong card draw engine, this can be nice; though you still "lose" the two cards for the effect of the Prospector.

Ah ... I had predicted on another topic the Forth Eorlingas event but it does not have exactly the same action as I thought

 

I'm very happy with the cards

Well, from what we have from Voice of Isenguard also

 

Now Dunhere will be able to attack with the spear in the staging area with 4 ATT , and ready with the horse if he kills something to make a second attack with 3 ATT against an enemy engaged with you , and Eomer also who can attack with 4 using the spear, 6 if another character leaves play and ready again with the horse ... suddenly Rohan seem very deadly

No, Dúnhere with the Spear attacks for 5; and for 7 with two copies!

Does the Tactics event 'Forth Eorlingas!' allow Rohan characters to combine to attack? I would expect not, which is a shame, but entirely understandable.

 

Very nice cards overall. I am enjoying the development of different strategies at the moment, with lots of cards allowing for manipulation of encounter draws and how combat works.

As it is written, it only works for heroes. Which really makes it limited in use, but still potentially good.

That Spirit Tactics Rohan deck is looking pretty good. I'll be glad to dust off my old SoM Rohan cards to make an incredible new deck!

 

Also, as always, i'll be really glad to see images of the cards to see the art.

The tactics cards in this pack look ace!

Specially the power of forth eorlingas in a multiplayer game with several Rohan heroes around the board seems deadly.

Lay of nimrodel is the first song card that's an event I think. Feels more proper so.

And a nice card it is in a combo with parting gifts from another player with SoG and lots of tokens to spend for a massive quest push. (Yes I only play multiplayer, so my combo set-up thinking usually starts like this)

Then hidden cache....I am so exited what kind of combos people will come up with here, as it is neutral and can be played in any deck. I must say, because it is so multi purpose, I expect some great feats with it!

Argh, I mistyped! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I meant, can multiple heroes attack the same character at the same time? However it works, it's a mighty exciting card, coupled with the spear! Would a ranger/Rohan deck work well now?

## 14 [Scroll Lock on November 13, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93450-morgul-vale-player-card-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=907913)

Yes it would ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

I am very grateful for Spear of the Mark since Dúnhere is my favourite hero and attacking staging area/direct damage is my favourite strategy.

I hope these tactics cards are just introduction of this technique and it will be developed in "The Ring-maker".

Hidden Cache + Zigil Miner + Imladris Stargazer = POWERHOUSE

 

Line up 2 of them with the Stargazer, call them and dig them out with the Miner, then rake in 6 resources (and in Spirit sphere, too).

 

P.S. Use the prospector as part of an outlands deck where you can can use Men of the West to grab up swaths of your discarded allies at a time.  It's a great form of card draw as long as you can pull from your discard pile.

Nothing blowing my mind here but it is cool to be able to use Dunhere now. I was hoping for more Gondor stuff but Visionary Leadership is good. Now I really want to make a Rohan/Gondor two-player deck strategy.

I have the quest. I game with three other players weekly and we don't like to spoil the quest before we first attempt it. So I am refraining from looking at the quest until we can play tomorrow night. After that I could spoil some things if no one gets it to it first.

## 23 [ana4 on November 13, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93450-morgul-vale-player-card-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=908301)

Just to make sure, if anyone can clarify: the Cache action can only be used once, right, since it is an event? I mean you can spend X to draw X... the reason I ask is because the action is worded just like Protector of Lórien, for instance.

## 24 [Hastur360 on November 13, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93450-morgul-vale-player-card-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=908324)

Well Protector of Lorien is an attachment and can be used the 3 times due to each 1 being a seperate action and still being in play. The event when played is played and gone. I am sure that is not technical of an answer.

## 25 [GrandSpleen on November 13, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93450-morgul-vale-player-card-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=908327)

Nice cards.  I see many more Gondor and Rohan decks on the horizon.  Visionary Leadership affects all Gondor characters on the table.  Imagine using Mutual Accord and beefing up the willpower of a Rohan questing deck... and adding Against the Shadow to shatter Siege quests.

 

Spear of the Mark gives us another reason to use Nor Am I A Stranger.  Very fun on a Ranged character with Great Yew Bow or Hands Upon the Bow, I think.

 

Now, questions...  It looks like there should be no problem using multiple of your own heroes and Forth Eorlingas! to attack a single enemy in the staging area.  How about Dunhere now -- if attacking with other heroes, I am reading it that he does NOT get his +1 attack bonus for attacking an enemy in the staging area.

Yeah, that's what I thought.

 

As for Dúnhere, I read it he only gets the bonus when he is doing both: attacking alone into the staging area. When another hero joins him, his bonus is gone...

As do I... and Faramir, the ally, wouldn't hurt these massive surges of combined Rohan & Gondor willpower either...

 

Don't think I have ever used 'nor am I a stranger', i'll need to retrieve it from my group of coasters... at least until there are some more Rohan hero's to choose from... imagine that card lends itself to creating some rather unusual horse lords.

Wow, the power creep! That's almost outlandish!

 

Visionary Leadership should cost at least 4 resources. Or they should have made it an event like For Gondor! But this?

 

Aragorn, VL, StwB, SoG aaaaaand Faramir ally is going to blow away every encounter deck.

No, finally Boromir got his proper attachment, Visionary Leadership. Still the shame about the Outlands, I wish they were weak but you could incorporate them into Gondor decks...

Yes, i already try Visionary Leadership proxy with Faramir, can blow through a quest card in one round, once lots of gondor allies are in play. I considered adding Aragorn StwB, but then you get too outlandish.

Gondor really struggled with willpower so i am fine with it, they needed something like this to build their trait, we'll see if it comes at a cost to game mechanics, at least with new quests.

At least Leadership Boromir has found a way into a deck for me.

Dunhere has also been revived. I am running him in a low threat deck. I put in 3 spears and 3 daggers to ensure he will get one early. Working good so far on older quests.

Yes, and one really needs no Leadership Aragorn and Sword that was Broken in such a deck... I think Imrahil and Théodred are better options... (the former more thematic anyways, and the latter keeps the threat a little lower)

Well he can defend or attack as well ... Ok then attacking is a stretch... oh Yes I got it... he could have a ranger bow attachment ;D

 

Laugh i'm not seriously defending this at all... though I would like to note that Denathor the ally is also 4 points, so Faramir, the ally, seems like a bargain by comparison.

 

I do like how flexible VS is. Looking forward to playing about with Gondor and Gondor/Rohan decks, which looks like fun -even if there is heap of room for overwill.

Out of all the Gondor heroes the highest willpower you get is 2. If your playing with three Gondor heroes in a primarily Gondor deck questing with will power is pretty abysmal for the first turn, and the cheap allies mostly have 0 to 1 will power. Usually it takes awhile to get Faramir in the game, so this attachment is an alternative that can give Gondor a boost early on, which they need, but when Faramir is out later on it seems like it will become unbalanced.

Sure gondor decks can be made with out this new attachment, but i think willpower was the traits weakest area.

Not sure I can I agree with you here.If leadership has a weakness, than it's their defense (and their high ratio of ugly allies). With all these new 3+ ATT enemies all of the mentioned heroes will bite the dust sooner than later.

 

Tracker. Using a mono leadership deck with Boromir, Aragorn and Prince Imrahil  you can play StwB on turn 1, raising your WP to a total of 8 immediatly. Faramir or Denetor (ally) can give you another boost next turn, given that you have one of the many Gondor cards in your hand that increase your pool of resources. or you play all these 1 cost allies that profit from Aragorn's, Boromir's and Faramir's boosts. And now we have VL, too. That's simply too much. I have no clue how the designers plan to balance this. Either they're going to raise the threat of future enemies and locations, which means that lore and tactics will have it harder. Or they use the battle and siege keywords more often, which sucks for spirit decks (ok, only for battle).

Sure, although Aragorn is not Gondor.

My Gondor deck is Imrahil, Denethor, and i trade of between Leadership and tactics Boromir.

It's more difficult if you really want to build a strictly Gondor deck.

Leadership sphere has great willpower, but I think it was Gondor trait that suffered.

Difficulty 7.  Mordor Elite and Creatures of the Forest encounter sets.

Each of the 3 Quest cards require defeating a Captain enemy before continuing on and don't require any quest points to complete.  Another combat focused quest.

Wait... so they add a powerful attachment that greatly boosts willpower... then they pit you against a scenario that doesn't require much questing power? Interesting tactics.

I was wondering if creatures of the forest would see an adventure pack use.  Sounds like a cool quest.  Ordered mine tonight, likely wont receive it till late next week

Yes sure Morgul spider is really deadly and there is some treachery like Watcher in the wood is also very bad one!

Would have been nice to see Mablung in this pack; saving him for future use I guess. Should have subbed him in for either that dwarf or song, neither of which seem particularly interesting to me

I played the quest last night in a 4player. We beat the scenario but still lost a hero. The scenario is very interesting and if you don't have a good defender or attacker it could become painful. There are some really interesting Shadow mechanics in the packs encounter set.  We had a lot of damage on heroes and characters as well till the Wardens of Healing made their presence felt.

 

I really liked the story of this whole cycle and there is quite a bit of story included in the chapter pack. I liked how it all tied together with the Heirs of Numenor box. If this and Black Riders are any indication of the directions they are taking the game then Voice of Isengard should be really full of flavor.

Did my guess about the story in the cycle Against the Shadow came true, and the Lord  Alcaron are a traitor?

Looking at the setup on card The Rearguard I think that he is the second captain (the first is Murzug, third Nazgul of Minas Morgul).

I've played this quest 3 times now. All of them solo.

 

It's simple for me: this is the most difficult quest for solo players in all the cycle. I don't know about 2+ players yet, but solo is not only difficult, its beautiful. It has some neat mechanics. It's a mix of race against the clock (you have an objective card that other encounter cards put tokens on it and if you have 10 you lose the game, and there are HIGH chances to put tokens) and brutal combat.

 

When I say brutal combat I mean solid enemies: the ones from Mordor Elite and Creatures of the Forest are cool, the Captains of Morgul Vale have powerful stats, like 4 to 7 attack or 5 to 7 hit poitns. But stats are not the problem. The problem are how their abilities are so well connected with other cards.

 

For instance, the first Captain after he attacks he reveals a card and if it's an enemy (and there's high chances, because this scenario is full of them) he puts it engaged with the player. The second Captain when he attacks he puts a progress token on the objective, and of course there are enemies or treacheries that react to that and also he attacks again if there was no shadow effect when revealing a shadow card, basically attacking twice. Even the locations are really nasty, but more or less easy to explore. And then you have the spiders or Lieutenant of Mordor...

 

I've played with dwarfs deck, the Thorin & Co. deck from Glaurung (with a bit fo tuning by my part). And they raped me.

 

I think that here a good Gondor deck with nice defense can come in handy. My best try was arriving at the final quest, and I decided to rush it. And then, bam, shadow effect where the enemy has +1 strength for each token on the objective. There my heroes started to fall.

 

This is one of those quests that makes you think about taking right decisions, and not facerolling.

 

And for the Alcaron traitor, well I prefer not to spoil anything right now, but the story continues and ends in an interesting way. Actually there were 2 inserts to explain all what was left of the story.

Doesn't the text on "To the Tower" take Faramir completely out of the game?

Played solo in normal mode and beat it on my first try. This was my Glory(Sp), Strider, Boromir(Tc) deck that can be found in the strategy section.* Not sure if I got lucky or not. You certainly can rip some brutal cards off the top of the deck, as when I had to pull a card first turn from Murzag's attack and drew Morgul Spider... And I had NO characters committed to the quest so it was attacking for 7! Still, I think my deck is very well placed for beating this quest. I do think it's an easier final quest than we have seen in the first two cycles, but in my opinion, those quests were unfair to the solo player and I think this one is not.

Will try again in a little bit.

*The only change to the deck I think is that I have replace Healing Herbs with Self Preservation.

Finished my second game and was brutalized by bad draws from my deck. My opening hand was bad and my mulligan was worse.

My jury is still out.

## 64 [Jekzer on November 16, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93450-morgul-vale-player-card-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=910188)

Tried 3 more times. This time with a Tactics-Spirit-Lore with Beregond, Glorfindel (the more scenarios FFG deliver the more I think this hero is crazy) and Strider.

 

It went better, I won 2 times of 3, but by no means were easy victories. In one of them my threat was skyrocketing and I never had Gandalf. The other victory with one less hero.

 

It's great how the encounter deck can punish you always, if you decide not to put progress on the objective, it does other nasty things. And if you put progress tokens, then the middle game (between the second and third captain) becomes harder.

 

Overall is a nice experience. I am with Bullroarer Took, this quest for solo it's difficult but it's not unfair like RtM or SaF, when they were out. Of course now we have more options in terms of powerful deckbuilding, and that's nice.

Another two games, another two loses. Needed one more turn on the last game and I would have had it. Off to side boarding. You don't have time in this quest to build up combos or a big army. You need cards with low cost that help you right now.

Not sure about multi-player.

Edit: This is brutal! I now realize how lucky I got in my encounter draws that first game. Three more plays and three more loses. Sooooo close twice, but couldn't seal the deal. The encounter deck is just merciless.

Did I just read Rich talking about the movies besides how he dislikes them? 

 

Seriously though, the art on the spear is absolutely amazing. The prospector is also really good. Lay of Nimrodel is fine, but I was fearing we would get a Magali Villeneuve art for it. It's just getting a little tiring for me. She's good, but they're using her way too much. Can we get for once an elf/female/hero related art not done by her?

--Horse-- ( :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]): Atachment spirit
Attachment for Gondor or Rohan hero
Response: after the attachment hero is commited to the quest, pay 1 resource of him to ready him.

Lay of Nimrodel (Event spirit):
Action: chose an spirit hero. Until the end of the phase, this hero gains +1wp by each resource on his resource pool.

--Spear--: Attachment Tactics
Attachment for a rohan character. Restricted.
The attached character get +1attack, or +2attack if he attacks an enemy from the staging area.

Go ahead, Eorlingas (Event tactics):
Combat action: each Rohan hero can be declared as a attacker versus enemies from stagin area this phase.

Ered Nimais (ally lore):
Response: after N enters play, discard the top 3 cards from your deck. After, chose 1 an add its from your discard pile to your deck, and shuffle it.

Isildur's Pergam (attachment lore):
- this is the attachment as the other spheres last pack adventures, but in Lore sphere -

Hidden stash (neutral event): ? can't see

I'll take the mantle of movie-hater.  One of the best things about this game is that it's based on the books, not the movies.  The movies were okay, but I think each one has gotten progressively farther from the intentions of the author.  The Hobbit was enough to finally push me too far.  I won't be seeing any more of Peter Jackson's adaptations.  They really have become his stories.

 

Anyway, to get back to the topic... I'm excited about this AP.  The Theoden and Rohan synergies are intriguing and we haven't even technically gotten into Rohan territory yet!  Discarding a card for beneficial effect is a very interesting idea and will provide some great new options for deckbuilding, especially against certain scenarios.

I would always agree that An Unexpected Journey was by far the closest to the book, of all the Middle-earth movies so far.

 

I think the Fellowship might be the best movie of them all but it really just skips most of the Book 1, my favourite. The Hobbit so far hasn't skipped much, and it made little changes, save bringing stuff from the other canon that is perfectly logical. But yes, this is very off topic.

Lets not forget, though, that the movies are an adaptation, not a direct line-for-line scene-for-scene filming of the book. Personally i'm quite glad they left out the constant inappropriate singing, and that there was no sign of Tom Bombadil, etc.

 

One important thing the movies did, though, was make a lot of people who'd never read the books (such as myself) want to read them.

I tried a gondor deck of Boromir tactics, Denethor and Imrahil and never made it out of the 2nd round twice. Decks that start with a high threat are going to be hit pretty hard early.

I then tried a new deck i have been tinkering with Frodo, Merry, and Dunhere, i never thought it would have a chance , but it won 3 out of 4 times. Dunhere with either two daggers or spears makes short work of almost all the enemies in the staging area before they engage.

Het Tracker you as usual try some new things? Yes Dunhere with all those new equipment will be very cool. But what you can tell about encounter deck?

SOME QUEST SPOILERS BELOW

All questing is done with Willpower no Battle or Siege.

There will be 5 threat already in staging are at start of the game.

You need to defeat a captain to advance to the next quest card and to eventually win the game. There are 3 captains.

1. Murzag already spoiled

2.This is the traitor so i Will spell his name backwards just in case someone does not want to know: noracla

engagement cost 10, threat 3, attack 4, def 3, HP 5

Forced: when he attacks place 1 token on To The Tower

forced: if he is dealt a shadow card without effect he attacks again deal another shadow card

3. Nazgul already spoiled

Transition to the 3rd quest card will reveal an encounter card.

Some cards attempt to place progress tokens on the To the Tower objective which is placed in the staging area at set up.

If 10 tokens are placed on this card you lose. Cards can also gain a boost by the number of progress on the cards.

White Bridge location (added at 3rd quest card) will get threat and quest point increase due to this progress on the objective

Most treachery cards place progress. The only one that deals damage to characters is Masters Malice.

There are plenty of attack boosting shadow effects. Some return enemy to staging area, and one will have enemy attack next player, which in solo is usually not good.

Overall there are 17 enemy, 6 location, and 14 treachery in encounter deck.

Doomed keyword is pretty common, and a few surge cards, which are not so bad.

I think the scenario will need a specific type of deck and it will probably not be easy. It's a tough quest, but doable with the card pool we have.

Got the quest in today and tried it 3 times losing each time.  It definitely is a challenging scenario but I think a powerhouse deck would be able to handle it even though i was unsuccessful each time with my more thematic offerings.  First time I used a Gondor deck with Boromir (leadership), Beregond, and Sam and just got trounced.  The next two times I used a deck of Bard, Glorfindel (spirit), and Dunhere which was designed to slaughter enemies in the staging area.  The first time i used it, i got quite far...to the last stage with 2 points of damage to the nazugl, but succumed to too many enemies and not enough defense.  Second time only made it to stage 2 before my lack of defense ended my game.  (side note: the deck i used itself was a lot of fun and would probably be very succesful vs a normal scenario)

 

As for the scenario itself, most of the enemies are strong, there are some brutual treacheries, and nearly every shadow effect increases the enemy's damage output so be prepared with a burning brand or some extra points of DEF.

 

As for the narrative, it has a decent enough if not unsurprising conclusion and hints ever so vaguely at the setting of the next cycle (even though we already know what it is).  What I was surprised is that there was a whole extra sheet of narrative including some prequel material aka story set before the events of the HoN box which was really cool and detailed.

 

Hope everyone enjoys the quest

That sounds pretty cool Pharmboys. I'll be getting this pack in about a month but what does it say more or less about the next cycle? Or is it a spoiler?
