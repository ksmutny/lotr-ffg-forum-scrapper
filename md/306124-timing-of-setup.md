# [Timing of &quot;Setup&quot;](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/306124-timing-of-setup/)

## 1 [kainveus on February 22, 2020](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/306124-timing-of-setup/?do=findComment&comment=3900028)

There are several "Setup" in the game now——Contract cards like "Messenger of the King"/"The Grey Wanderer" , other player cards like Thurindir/The One Ring , and also quest cards. But when did these effect triggers? Before the players draw their openning hands , or after ?
    Some cards, like Gandalf's Delay ,should be trigger before player draw their hands and mulligan, but how about Thurindir? Should he search for the side quest  and draw the other 5 cards? If so , how to take mulligan ?
    If the "Setup" effect triggers after the players draw their hands , If they get the Ally/Attachment for "Messenger of the King"/"The Grey Wanderer" in the openning hand, do that means they had to prepare a Plan B ?

I think the legit answer is that they work whenever is best for that particular card, according to designer whim on the day asked.

sappidus, o keeper of all official rulings and musings, please help us.

For the below, it is useful have RR Setup [http://www.lotr-lcg-quest-companion.gamersdungeon.net/#Rule593] on hand—the current status is…

 * [Setup steps #6 & #7 are essentially encounter setup.]
 * Contract Setup occurs after the encounter setup portion of setup step #7 (ruling [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/277776-unofficial-official-rulings-thread/?do=findComment&comment=3836651], and additional ruling [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/277776-unofficial-official-rulings-thread/?do=findComment&comment=3906124], and why not one more ruling [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/277776-unofficial-official-rulings-thread/?do=findComment&comment=3906218]).
 * The One Ring from Shadow in the East also occurs at the same step #7, despite what the rulesheet [http://www.lotr-lcg-quest-companion.gamersdungeon.net/#Rule626] says (ruling [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/306124-timing-of-setup/?do=findComment&comment=3906264] that appears to serve as an erratum to the rulesheet, I guess).
 * Hero Setup also occurs at the same step #7 (per this ruling [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/306124-timing-of-setup/?do=findComment&comment=3923584], which countermands an older ruling [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/256513-setup-abilities-on-hero-cards-eowyn-denethor-thurindir/]).
 * Saga setup was detailed at the end of the post here, all of which remains true AFAIK. Note the business about Gandalf's Delay:

Additional note on Nightmare Setup: IIRC it is different from quest to quest whether you do it before quest 1A Setup (pretty sure NM Assault on Osgiliath is meant to work this way), or afterwards (e.g., NM Encounter at Amon Din). Or, in the case of NM Raid on the Grey Havens & NM Storm on Cobas Haven, as a replacement for part of 1A's text. The above-mentioned principle of "whenever it seems like it's supposed to" is probably best here.

I still hope they will revert contract setup to step 2, where it was originally said to be and where it more logically belongs.

I once got a ruling from Caleb about Thurindir along the lines of: You place your heroes before drawing your starting hand, therefore you first search your deck for a side quest, then draw 6 cards. If you decide to take a mulligan you only shuffle "these 6 cards back into your deck" and keep the side quest in hand.

## 7 [sappidus on February 28, 2020](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/306124-timing-of-setup/?do=findComment&comment=3904261)

Card Talk just released an interview with Caleb & Matt during which Grey Wanderer's Setup timing is discussed. Essentially, they reconfirmed that the timing is as previously ruled—after encounter setup—with some further discussion that implied to my ears that Caleb is not considering reversing the ruling, or making any of the individual contracts have different Setup timing or anything like that. But y'all should listen for yourselves.

But is says right in the instructional booklet for A Shadow in the East on page 6: "The One Ring has Setup text that instructs you to attach it to a hero you control. This is done immediately after placing your starting heroes in your play area (i.e. step 2)."

I'm not really sure when this whole "setup on player cards happens during step 7" originated but I'm house ruling otherwise.

I think that means search the master card in step 7.

Or just errata Grey Wanderer's set-up to read" "... an attachment with a printed cost of 1 and without the Guarded keyword and put it into play."

Or just add two future-proofing lines to the rule about Guarded Player Cards that read: "If a Guarded card is put into play during Set-Up, it remains in the Staging Area.  At the start of the first Planning Phase, for any Guarded Cards put into play during Set-Up, discard cards from the Encounter Deck until the appropriate type is discarded and attached to the Guarded card."  -OR- "Guarded Player Cards may not be played or put into play during Set-Up."  


What I personally dislike most about the current slew of Set-Up rulings is the tedium.  Having to run duplicate copies of desired fetched-cards isn't terribly burdensome because such decks already enjoyed a lean efficiency (e.g. at the most extreme a Grey Wanderering Thurindir with the Ring is effectively running a 46 card deck with two attachments and an 8-card starting hand), so offsetting that with back-up copies of fetched cards or secondary targets isn't awful, but it does hurt efficiency somewhat. 

But it does add tedious steps to the set-up of each game.  Prior to these rulings, I could start my Grey Wanderer with its 1-cost attachment of choice and my desired Master Card already pulled, then shuffle my deck, draw my hand, and resolve my mulligan (if needed).  Now, I have to shuffle my deck, resolve my muligan (which is needed more often since I want to pitch 'fetch card' targets), THEN I have to search and shuffle my deck twice before the game starts.  Which just adds about 60 seconds of tedium before I can play.  Not a huge inconvenience, of course, but a minor annoyance, as you're effectively adding 2.5* shuffles before you can start playing.

*depending on whether or not you Mulligan because of would-be-fetched cards in your starting hand.

I'm a rule nazi in general and crave challenge but as mentioned, not playing with slightly errata'd versions of these cards, assuming they do indeed work the unideal way, just results in tedium, resets, decks that are less than optimal in clunky ways, and its one thing I'm more than happy to house rule.

Just imagine a new player in your playgroup excitedly busting out their grey wanderer decker kings messenger only to tell them they actually need to shuffle the card they have out into their deck. I can practically feel the enthusiasm for the game sapping from this hypothetical characters soul.

I asked him about this ruling in light of the most recent one and he explicitely answered me that the current ruling ovverules any past one, so right now Thurindir (and other heroes setup effects I guess) should happen at step 7 after the scenario setup.

I'm assuming the new rule would override what's written in the Black Riders rules about Setup...

> Quote
> 
> Setup instructions appear on some player cards and encounter cards in The Lord of the Rings: The Black Riders. If a player card with Setup instructions is in a player’s deck at the beginning of a game, that player searches his deck for that card and follows its instructions before drawing his first hand. Similarly, if an encounter card with Setup is in the encounter deck at the beginning of a game, search the encounter deck for that card and follow its instructions before resolving the Setup instructions on the quest.

So it would apply to boons as well. There are boons with the word Permanent. I don't think the new rule would apply to them. They still get placed out with the heroes during step 2 of setup.

But why would Permanent boons be any different?  The Black Riders booklet says that all boon cards in the campaign pool are added to players' decks.  While it does say that you fish out the permanent ones and attach them to your hero "at the start of the game," but isn't any more specific than that.  The Shadow in the East booklet explicitly says to attach the One Ring to a hero in Step 2, and that's been over ridden by this latest ruling, so why wouldn't this? Caleb has been very explicit that (1) he doesn't remember all his past rulings AND (2) what he has said now about all player cards with Set-Up effects overrules all other rulings, including those explicitly printed in rules inserts to the contrary (e.g. the Master Ring) and long-standing FAQ/RulesAnswers to the contrary (e.g. Thurindir).  I now see no reason to assume that Campaign Boons, permament are not, are fished from decks at any time other than Step 7 with all the other set-up stuff.

Which means by the end of a campaign, the odds of ending up with a really bad (read: small) starting hand go up, especially if you use heroes like Thurindir or Contracts like Grey Wanderer / Messenger of the King, and heroes like Galdor become unusable ... especially assuming that you cannot play set-up cards like Boons or the One Ring if they are in the discard pile... but we still don't have a clear answer on that.

Basically, Set-Up effects are a total disaster now and have become, as others have noted, unintuitive, frustrating, and tedious.

You can literally fix all of these problems by keeping Setup effects where they originally were and errata-ing Grey Wanderer to specify that the 1-cost attachment can't be Guarded, right?

Just watched a snippet of that video.  It seems Gandalf's delay is the *ONLY* card that's supposed to take place out of Step 7 Set-up.  So you definitely CAN draw permanent boons.  Does that also mean Gildor Inglorion (Boon) and other boons/burdens don't get shuffled into the Encounter Deck until after the Quest set-up is resolved?  I guess that depends on the order of set-up instructions in Step 7?  I think I'm confusing myself now.

Caleb says he will take some time to check all the rules/rulings again when he has all his material available (since right now he is not going to the office to work) and look at the whole matter again.

One thing he said is that if you Grey Wanderer a Guarded attachment which get some stuff out of the encounter deck which is then put aside during the quest card setup he would imagine that the Guarded attachment is put aside with the encounter card.

A grey wanderer guarded card at step 2 is still problematic.  You can easily discard some cards that don't fit the guarded requirements that the quest cards will tell you to search the encounter deck for and you've already reached a null state.  You can still "cheat" guarded cards in for free in quests like Watcher in the Water 1B where you add cards into the staging area until there is X [Threat].  I feel like they're a host of many other quest-specific problems but I can't think of them all off the top of my head.

There is a ruling you can make to fix these issues, avoiding the much abhorred errata of a new card (which is way more of a taboo to designers than players) or disastrous Set-Up changes.  In step 2, when Side A instructs you to put it into play, just sit the guarded card in the staging area.  Then, at the end of step 7, when the quest is set-up and ready, deal it a guarded card.  It's a little wonky, but it fixes every problem and I think it is the truest implementation of how everything is supposed to work.

The easiest way, already suggested by lot of people in this forum and which I put to Caleb's attention, to avoid this problem is to put a "no Guarded" restriction to the attachment played through The Grey Wanderer.

I wouldn't mind deferring the Guarded effect until the end of set up, but I also think issues that arise from playing a Guarded card at step 2 are not an issue unless they *break* the quest in the player's favor.  Choosing a Guarded attachment with Grey Wanderer is a choice, and if a player choice makes it impossible for the player to win via bad interaction, that's a choice a player should not have taken and is completely avoidable -- much like putting Ungoliant's Spawn in the victory display for Passage Through Mirkwood, there's no need for errata when it's completely avoidable.  Likewise, if some quest interaction lets a Guarded card get into play free or cheaply, good for the player!  That's not game-breaking, it's just good tactics.  But if a Guarded play has the potential to neuter the entire quest (in the player's favor), then it's possible a Grey Wanderer deck could ruin a quest for a whole table by choosing a Guarded card.  Are there any quests that actually fit that description?

There is an annoyance factor with step 2 guarded, though, in that in practice I don't actually shuffle the encounter deck until I *have to*, which means that if I'm searching for cards to set aside I never actually bother shuffling them into the enoucnter deck in the first place.

## 33 [Catastrophic09 on July 31, 2020](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/306124-timing-of-setup/?do=findComment&comment=3967985)

Setup for contracts should still happen in step 2, it only makes sense and changing it to step 7 messes everything up. I strongly disagree with Caleb's ruling and hope he changes it back-we can of course play how we want but this just annoys me knowing a poor ruling was made that should now be "official". As for Grey Wanderer simply say search your deck for a 1 cost attachment and set it aside, put it into play at the end of setup. There, now there is no issue with any scenario's setup or guarded cards since there wasn't a problem to begin with as there was an encounter deck by step 2.

I was building a MotK deck with Folco and a hobbit ally turned Hero on ringsDB and noticed the starting threat was 1 point higher, like it wasn’t reducing Folco’s threat for the hobbit ally turned hero. At the current state of doing contract setups in step 7, is that correct that Folco’s threat reduction isn’t recognizing the hobbit ally turned hero? If contracts went back to step 2, would that hobbit ally turned hero then be recognized by Folco?

Let's say your intended starting heroes are Folco, Gandalf, and MotK-Bilbo. With step #7 contract setup, this is the relevant sequence of events:

 * At step #2, all [printed] heroes are placed simultaneously, so Folco & Gandalf hit the table. Their text is active immediately, so when you then set your starting threat to the sum of their threat costs, Folco takes the one Hobbit hero he can see—himself—into account, and you get 6+14=20
 * At step #7, MotK's Setup fires. You fetch Bilbo and add the sum of his stats (4) to your starting threat, yielding 24. (Folco's threat cost is now 5, but it doesn't really matter, as the moment in the game where you access his threat cost already passed at step #2. In that sense, it's not much different than putting Sword-thain on a Hobbit ally later in the game.)

So, RingsDB is correct in this case.

If contract setup were indeed back at step #2, AFAICT it's actually still a little arguable whether the interaction would allow Folco to see the additional Hobbit hero. Intuitively, of course he would, but the way that step #2 and MotK are written, there are two paths I see:

 1. MotK Setup happens after the regular events of step #2. This essentially leads to the same outcome as the current state of things—Bilbo becomes a hero too late for Folco's lowered threat cost to functionally matter.
 2. MotK Setup happens before the regular events of step #2. Now MotK is adding a number to an not-yet-defined starting threat. Even if you assume that "undefined" can be taken as 0, because MotK does not actually define a threat cost for Bilbo, the regular step #2 stuff will then entirely erase whatever you did beforehand, and you'll end up with a starting threat of just Folco & Gandalf, now 5+14=19. This seems incorrect.

If you truly want the MotK hero to enter play at the exact same time as your printed heroes and be perceived exactly like a printed hero for something like Folco (i.e., MotK Setup happening during the regular events of step #2), you'd not only have to have step #2 contract setup, but you'd also have to write MotK differently and make reference to defining the MotK hero's threat cost (and not just adding a number to the starting threat). Or, rewrite step #2 somehow.

Sappidus, as always, thank you for the explanation.

Correct me if I am wrong, but the benefit to playing MotK in step 7 (in your hero lineup example) is that you get to draw your hand and mulligan if needed before step 7 (trying to make sure you have wizard’s pipe and/or hobbit pipe in your starting hand) and then play MotK during step 7 to play ally Bilbo and use his ability to search for another pipe. So you could start with 2 or more pipes to start round 1? If you moved MotK and hero actions like Thurindir back to step 2, then technically you are drawing their setup (or coming into play) cards before actually drawing your hand?

I have asked this before, but in light of setups being in step 7, could you do The One Ring setup after the MotK setup, giving you the ability to target the MotK ally turned hero with The One Ring (Bilbo in your example)?

## 37 [Catastrophic09 on August 1, 2020](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/306124-timing-of-setup/?do=findComment&comment=3968519)

It could go either way as mentioned above and Folco is a bit confusing as he doesn't say Setup- instead it's almost a passive ability. Contract rules state "choose one contract to put into play along with his heroes" you immediately then fetch your MotK ally from the contract setup and then get your starting threat which you would now have two hobbit Heroes.. This does interrupt the setup in step 2 and perhaps contract setup should occur after initial heroes are placed and threat set at the end of step 2 and then Folco wouldn't reduce by one extra threat.

The One Ring rules for setup state "This is done immediately after placing starting heroes in your play area" thus you cannot put the One Ring on a MotK ally no matter how you do the contract timing since this setup specifically states to do it immediately where normally when actions happen simultaneously in this game the player chooses the order to resolve.

As for other setup cards that fetch certain cards from your deck-doing it in step 7 of setup instead of 2 is almost always bad because now your MotK can whiff if you drew the ally and your Grey Wanderer can fail to play you 1 cost attachment if its in your hand and now you also have to pay for it..ugh.  Setup in step 2 is the best! Your fetched card is in your hand, no worries about whiffing and the search effects of the cards with setup are doing what they were intended to do. Then in step 5 for drawing and mulliganing ignores the one fetched card since "that player may shuffle the six cards back into his or her deck and draw another set of six cards". The set of six cards excludes the one fetched card.

It all makes the most sense and Contract setup should not be in step 7 of setup!!!

Does anyone else wish guarded cards should just work with grey wanderer and not trigger guarded? Starting with 1 hero is such a disadvantage that I cant see why you couldn't just grab a 'free' guarded card and still be playing a balanced deck.

Sure Necklace of Girion and Stone of Elostirion would be the most popular picks but at least there would besome competition for strider.

Or just errata grey wanderer to specify the attachment can’t be guarded, I’d be happier with it that way. 

## 40 [GrandSpleen on August 2, 2020](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/306124-timing-of-setup/?do=findComment&comment=3969016)

Or add a faq entry that says if a guarded card enters play while there is no encounter deck, resolve its effect after there is an encounter deck. 

## 41 [wynalazca on August 4, 2020](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/306124-timing-of-setup/?do=findComment&comment=3969970)

There's a few options the devs could take here.

1) Add a step in the setup rules that says "All setup card effects resolve" and just put it after you do your draw/mulligan - if this happens I'd really like to see MotK and possibly The Grey Wanderer errata'd to say "from deck or hand" so you can always hit your intended target, you can just get unlucky and have to play -1 card at the start of the game when you draw it in your opener.

2) change all of the setup effects to be response effects like Galdor of the Havens. 

As an example for Denethor: "Setup: Add 2 resources to Denethor's resource pool." could become "Response: After Denethor enters play, add 2 resources to his resource pool."
Now there is more clarity and each card can properly resolve at a specific timing chosen by the devs.

Why wouldn't you want guarded attachments to work for 'free' with grey wanderer?

## 43 [GrandSpleen on August 5, 2020](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/306124-timing-of-setup/?do=findComment&comment=3970699)

Well, it wouldn't be terrible. My opinion of Grey Wanderer is that its effects simply compensate for the cost of the deckbuilding restrictions, and offers very little else to you. It's just a strong Secrecy support tool. So, changing this into a contract that lets you use guarded attachments for free.... I guess that'd be OK.

The encounter deck *does* exist at step two, though.  However, it's not obvious to me that any quest is broken *in the player's favor* by using a Guarded card while fish-out cards are still in the encounter deck, and players breaking *themselves* by choosing a Guarded card doesn't strike me as a problem that has to be solved.  (Though I've always found the "search the encounter deck" instructions on 1A cards pointless, as I never bother putting those cards in the deck in the first place.)

I do think a free Guarded card for Grey Wanderer would not be broken.

I think it would be a fun way to gain immediate access to those powerful cards. In a regular deck it needs the guarded but since the contract allows only 1 hero I think It would be fair, and fun too.

Dain beginning with ring of Thror, Eomer (L) with Orcrist, Bilbo (L) with Stone od Elostirion...
