So I was playing through The Battle of Five Armies today and had just got done questing and figuring out progress, and I was placing 11 down on stage 2B, which needs 8. My question is: do

you only put 8 onto the quest card? Or would I put 11?

Just keep piling them on.  There is no upper limit on the number of progress tokens you can place on a card. It's good, too -- there are some effects that remove progress tokens from cards, so it is good to have extra ones on there.

That's actually why I was asking! There was an effect where I had to remove a progress token at the end of the round. Glad to hear it's like this. Thanks for the response.

There are people that when place 8 progress tokens on 2b, 3b or 4b..., discard that quest card. I think it is not correct, i think you add excess progress tokens but not discard quest card.

 

What do you think?

you only flip the quest card after you have fulfilled the quest requirements. The default is a number of token but more often now there is a condition you need to fulfill. Until that condition is fulfilled, you just keep piling the tokens on the quest card. This only really matters in quests that have ways of removing progress tokens and other special circumstances.

Definitely not the way I would play it, so I agree with you, probably incorrect. The quest has ways of removing progress, including one that removes all progress from the current quest (I think). And while I'm thinking about it now, would the same logic also pertain to enemies like Durin's Bane? Can you simply keep beating on them and get them well below what would normally destroy them in order to counteract things like their regeneration and whatnot?
