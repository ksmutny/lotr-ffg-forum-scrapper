# [Exhausted Question](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/94320-exhausted-question/)

Hey everybody, I was just wondering something and haven't been able to clarify it by reading through the rulebook and FAQ, so I'm hoping for some insight. I was wondering if actions can be used while a character is exhausted, so long as they do not require exhaustion to be used. For example, can Westfold Outriders action to discard and engage an enemy be used after it resolves an attack? Or am I missing something where actions require the character to be readied? Thanks in advance.

if an action doesnt require it to exhaust, i.e. be ready, then it is fine.
