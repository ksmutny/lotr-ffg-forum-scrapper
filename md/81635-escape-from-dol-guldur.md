During the quest, players can only play one ally per turn.  Does this exclude cards that would allies to play from your hands?  I was thinking in particular about Sneak Attack, Timely Aid, and Bofur.  Also, during my last playthrough of the quest, I ended up having to defeat the Nazgul twice.  Shouldn't he be a victory card to set aside?

The cards that "put something into play" do not count against the limit of one ally per turn, as far as I know, because it says that you can only "play" one ally per turn, so putting a card into play with the cards that you mentioned would be allowed.  As for the Nazgul, I was confused about it too, but that's the way it is I guess.

Thanks! It makes the quest at least somewhat easier that way.
