Hi everyone,

The Anvil, is my blog for hobby resources. I am aware that there are many blogs and sites that provide the same thing. There are only two words that I can address to their makers and owners - THANK YOU! 

 
The Anvil is my free-time project for all those who want to have hobby resources related to card and board games at one place so they can browse through their e-collections. So, The Anvil will not provide reviews but just downloads of the resources that are already on the internet. You may wonder - "so what's the **** difference?". It is very simple - I like to have cards, rules, etc. on my computer, and I think that I am not alone.

I DO NOT own any rights related to the games. I am using hobby material that is already on the internet, and I am spending a significant amount of time to collect-download-save-edit-upload-post the material that I found.

I RESPECT every site or blog with the same purpose and The Anvil IS NOT something that would decrease importance of the other sites and blogs.

I SUPPORT hobby related companies with bying their products.

Visit, share, comment, don't hate, have fun.
