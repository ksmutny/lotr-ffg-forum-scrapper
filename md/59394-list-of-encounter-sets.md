I feel like this has come up before, but I couldn't find what I'm looking for. Is there a list somewhere of all of the released quests and which encounter sets they use? I am looking at purchasing individual encounter sets (here: www.toywiz.com/lotrlcgcorespidersofmirkwood.html [http://www.toywiz.com/lotrlcgcorespidersofmirkwood.html]) so I can have all my quests permanently put together, but I need a list before I purchase them.

If this doesn't exist, maybe I'll try and put one together this evening. It would be nice to have a checklist.

Â That's not a bad idea. At a buck each I might consider doing the same thing once I catch up with my main collection.

I think this list has what you're looking for:

That is exactly what I was looking for, thanks!
