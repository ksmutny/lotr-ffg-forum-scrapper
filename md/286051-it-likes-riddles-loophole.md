This is less of a rules question but more of an odd technicality I found. I'm pretty sure it works.

The rules for Riddle effects in DDaCD state that you may choose to resolve the staging of a card as normal or take its riddle effect.   http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/It-Likes-Riddles-THOHaUH [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/It-Likes-Riddles-THOHaUH]

When It Likes Riddles? is revealed players can chose to resolve the when revealed effect (answering two riddles) or just take the riddle effect and end up only resolving the one. The only reason I can see for this being intended is as a way to speed up progress on Stage 2 if the players want, because otherwise; why would you chose to answer two riddles instead of one? :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

It likes Riddles? says "the first player must choose to answer the riddle on this card" so doesn't that take your choice away? You have to answer it. Now, since you've answered it, if you find a match you must do the second. If you don't pass the first riddle you aren't forced into the second.

Haha, that'd be it. I can't believe I didn't notice that and now feel stupid for bumping this thread. :ph34r: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_ph34r.png]

Thanks!

haha, no worries. I just made an error about a guarded Grima objective and eventually found the answer on a several year old post.

I don't agree. The players' decision to answer the riddle or resolve the card normally surely must happen before the card resolves normally. And even if for some reason we have to pay attention to the first sentence of this card's When Revealed effect before it takes effect, all that would make us do is be forced to answer the riddle rather than the When Revealed effect, so we would never be allowed to answer the second riddle.

I think you may be right, @NathanH [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/254124-nathanh/]. The way the rules are written, that might be the case; but I think the developers intended the players to have to answer both riddles and the wording just came out wrong.

As the rules are written, you choose whether to answer the riddle or resolve the When Revealed, so clearly that happens before any part of the When Revealed resolves.
So yes, you should be able to just answer the one riddle. Unless you *want* to answer additional riddles to get through stage 2 faster.

I think this is the key, and how I initially played it. I kept running into the issue of running out of cards in my deck quickly, so the more riddles I could answer up front, the better. But suppose you don't want to take on two riddles... that's fine, just do the one.

Of course, as I am writing this, I am worried about the fact that there's optionality in favor of the players. Treacheries don't usually behave that way. But it does seem to "reward" you for getting things right on the first riddle... first, encounter card discarding, and second, another riddle, if you're after that.
