 Are there any retail shops where i could buy Lord of the rings LCG, deluxe expansions and boosters in Budapest? If there is, please give me the name of the retail shop and its exact address where i could buy it.

Hi Shteck!

I'm afraid I can't help you with retail shops, but if there aren't any (just ask your local game stores per email or personally) maybe you'd like to know that bookdepository has free shipping (from the UK [http://www.bookdepository.co.uk/], from the US [http://www.bookdepository.com]). The downside is they aren't very fast when it comes to add new packs to their homepage.
