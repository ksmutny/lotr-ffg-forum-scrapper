Have you gone in to speak to them or just called them on the phone?

My local store is amazing, but they are really bad about updating their new releases info. I thought they wouldn't have RtR when I went in, so it was great to find three copies of it at the store.

Poland is still waiting for RtR AND for Redhorn Gate.... Apparently our publisher has some giant issues with delivery,

 I ordered from Maelstrom who are usually pretty good, but I've not heard anything, and it's showing as "out of stock at supplier"

I must admit, I've avoided maelstrom since Khazad-dum took an extra week to arrive. 13th floor all the way for me!

I have it on pre-order with Maelstrom and also havent yet recieved it.

 

 With Redhorn gate i didnt get my pre-order copy with the intial batch (fair enough sometimes demand outstrips supply) so was patiently waiting. logged on to their site to find they had it in stock but nothing dispatched to me.... had to email them about the fact that they should fulfill their pre-orders before selling to others......

You guys could buy it off Amazon.

I used to buy the packs through amazon but they always showed out of stock as well... but with insane waiting times.... my first mirkwood packs arrived about 4 months late!

I tend to buy from the adventure packs from ebay now, since I can use Paypal and not straight access to my credit card. Nearly all of the packs I have bought have come from two sellers, Infinity Games and Gameslore - both have been fast delivery and have been available about a week (or so) after the US - I still can't work out UK release dates because the websites seem to have different dates on them. Both the stores I use have websites where you can order the items from as well as from ebay, ebay just feels quicker for me tbh.

I was about to mail maelstrom and complain again about them having them in stock but my pre-order not fulfilled..... but they just dispatched mine!

I got it tonight!!! Play 5 games! Really dissappointed. So easy to play!!! After KD and RHG this quest is peace of cake. Encounter deck have to many cards about 56 or something. More cards less effective. Maybe for 2 or more player is ok but for solo is to easy. Anyway difficult 4.

I need more challenge!!! For what i spend my money!!! So i must take out some cards which make game more easy then. And maybe add some another cards there.

 I don't think the problem with this one is that it's too easy per se.

The problem is that most of the time it's pretty easy, and then you get Sleeping Sentry as a shadow effect.

First time I played, I got hit with that one - discarded every single one of my characters (including Arwen) so that was the end of the game...

indeed- in fact the only way i can really see you losing this game is through that one card- ive never lost through other means- ie threat, individual damage, getting over ran

I have Bbrand in my deck so in not a big problem. Only when you have more then 2 enemies engage you have a chance to get Sleeping sentry but the chance is to small anyway. The quest is really boring and stupid!!! Compare RHG is step back on the quality in my opinion! 

I hate this feelings! You wait for pack around 1 month then when you get it play 5 games, win all of them and feel like FFG  lie to you.

What i has waiting for???? In PVP game you still get a chance to get strong opponent to make game more cool but here......... Another month of waiting of next quest and then is is also difficult 4 then you again dissappointed. In my opinion all this adventures is cool when they are really adventures, dangerous, dreadfull and exiting. When every decision can cost you a lot and wrong one can bring you down. But when you play and use only half of your brain like a walking in the park is bull. Special for Tolkien game. I think every quest should be much more difficult at least 6 or 7. My favorite is Osgiliath!!! this is a good one.

Why they cannot make some rules to increase the difficult of the quest by players???I dont wont to make my house rules cose balance is quite fragile.

And what about Tournaments system??? They promise it already 1 year before???

Sorry i bit upset now!!! Really, really dissappointed with RTR!!!

I have actually yet to win this one (probably played about 4 times now).  

Every time I've either been knocked out by the Sleeping Sentry shadow effect or Orc Ambush returning about 8 Orcs back into play.

I think it's rubbish having a "game over" shadow effect.  Poorly designed this one.
