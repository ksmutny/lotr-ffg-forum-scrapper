It's rare. It usually runs.

 

The administrator must be making some changes on the web. I don't know. Let's wait a little.

It was up just a day or two ago.  Now when I go to the page [http://octgn.gamersjudgement.com/wordpress/lotrlcg/wp-login.php?redirect_to=%2Fwordpress%2Flotrlcg%2Fimage-packs%2F] I get a sign in page saying only site administrators can view it.  Hm...

Some cards packages for Tabletop Simulator got DMCA warnings and got shut down. Maybe OCTGN is also getting warnings from FFG. The thing is that OCTGN makes money with the paid version by providing cards that are not yet available, like Land of shadows... I always wondered why FFG was letting that go.

You can still access links to image packs by viewing Google's cache of the page http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:http://octgn.gamersjudgement.com/wordpress/lotrlcg/image-packs/ [http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:http://octgn.gamersjudgement.com/wordpress/lotrlcg/image-packs/]

What is going on with image pack for The Treason of Saruman? Anybody knows about it? I think it should be published in November.

It went up some time in the last couple of days, though we're still waiting on the rest of the November update.
