## 1 [juicebox on February 1, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59858-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-4-player-tournament-1-february-12-completed/?do=findComment&comment=588069)

Welcome & Introduction:

Welcome to my first ever LOTR LCG 4 Player Tournament, a month-long tournament designed to set the stage for welcoming new players to this beloved game! The idea behind this is that for one month (February ’12), everyone is invited to participate in playing a particular scenario with particular deck building requirements in a 4 Player Tournament. You are then invited to record and post your final score, the heroes used, and any additional narrative you’d like to add.

Note: this is not a place to post results from the past. The tournament has a one-month lifespan, and only games played and recorded throughout this month are valid. As the month unfolds, I will keep this first post updated with the Top Ten results. (Each participant can occupy a maximum of one Top Ten spot at a time, so you’re welcome to try and best your own result throughout the month.) See also, The juicebox LOTR LCG Top Ten Hall of Fame [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=582954].

Will you place in the final Top Ten? I hope you’ll participate and find out!

After the end of this month’s tournament, you are welcome to continue to post results to this thread if you continue to play this particular quest under these particular parameters. However, the Top Ten on this first post will not continue to be updated after the month is over, thus preserving (like a time capsule) the results from this 4 Player Tournament. In the mean time, if you have ideas for a future tournament, feel free to suggest them in the Ideas Thread [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=579104&efpag=0].

And now… on to this month’s 4 Player Tournament!

4 Player Tournament #1:

Scenario: Passage Through Mirkwood*
Deck Parameters: 1-3 Core Sets + All Shadows of Mirkwood Adventure Packs**
Number of Players: Four Players

*My main idea here… if you haven’t already, it’s time to teach some friends the wonder of this game. And what better way that to start with the very first quest?

**In deck building for this 4 Player Tournament, each player may use cards from 1-3 copies of the Core Set + any Shadows of Mirkwood Adventure Packs per deck. (No need to record exactly what was used… I’ve decided to embrace the possible tie.)

Top Ten:

1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.
7.
8.
9.
10.
