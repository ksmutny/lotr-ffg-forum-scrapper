# [INewbee in need of deck building help](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/282576-inewbee-in-need-of-deck-building-help/)

I'm new to the game and I love it so far. I just wonder if someone could help me and my sons with some decks and/or deck building tips. Both for solo and 2 players.

What we have:

Limited edition starter

1 x core set

Entire Shadows of Mirkwood cycle

Khazad dum expansion

We are not planning to buy anything more for a while.

Thanks in advance!

Check out RingsDB.com, you can input what packs you have and search for user created decks based on that. It's probably one of the best online resources for managing decklists.

 

Going from memory you could probably get two dwarf decks easily then make a third to support them.

Here are some general tips.

A good rule of thumb is to have twenty allies, fifteen attachments, and fifteen events in your deck. Of course, if you play/open progression style (only using player cards that were released at the time of the quest you are playing's release), you might want to drop down to thirty cards for the first couple quests.

Try to have questing, attacking, and defending covered between the decks. If you play solo, have one hero to quest, one to attack, and one to defend.

What kind of decks you want you/your sons to play? We could help a lot more if we had a general idea. Also, I'll echo what's been said above and recommend RingsDB.

The articles on this page have been a great help to me.

And yes, check out RingsDb as has been suggested. With your card pool, you can do the Dwarf Starter Deck, which I found on RingsDb.

Thanks a lot!

Will give it a try.

The limited edition starter does not seem to be in ringsDB, though.

If you helpful people are ever in Stockholm, I will buy you a lunch!

It is listed as an option to mark as a pack you own, that way when you search for decks you can build or use their deckbuilder it'll only show you options you have access to.

 

I think they just don't have the alt-art available on the website, but since the cards all come from other packs if you search for the name of a card you'll find it.

The two cards in the limited edition not yet available in other packs are the heroes Thorin Stonehelm and Gildor Inglorion.  The art isn't at ringsdb for those two yet, but they are available to be selected as heroes.

Little bit off topic

Limited Edition Starter: checking this pack on RingsDB does not seem to add cards to collection other than the 2 new heroes. No big deal, especially for veterans.

I just wanted to share this info with other beginners.

You are right. This is only the 2 heroes are in the database shared by RingsDB and HallofBeorn. If someone can give them the scan they can probably add the cards.

Ah thanks for sharing; I wasn't aware of that. Just saw it as an option and assumed it was good to go like all the others.

I contacted Seastan at RingsDB regarding this. He has now added all the cards from Limited Edition Starter. Very kind!

Maybe there are other beginners like me. I got interested when I saw the Collectors Limited Edition with the Tabletop and Digital versions in one go.

I will never buy a second Core and I have now access to all the cards I own on RingsDB.

Applause to Seastan!
