Yeah, I had that all morning too. Couldn't even get into the main site at one point, it was awful! Finally made it, anyway - I breathe easier once again lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif]

I also had an error which was something about "Visual Basic - Permission Error". Well, I don't use VB, so I have no clue what was going on. preocupado.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/preocupado.gif]
