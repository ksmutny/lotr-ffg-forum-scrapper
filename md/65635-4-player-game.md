 Hello everyone,

I am trying to get my first 4 player game going this weekend and should have access to a second core set. My question is, do we combine the encounter cards from both sets when we play? I understand the restriction rules for Heros just not sure about encounter deck.

 No.  Leave the encounter set as it is.  Otherwise the balance will be all screwed up.
