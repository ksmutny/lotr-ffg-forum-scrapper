I would buy this.  It would be like the Thunderstone game system.

It would be a themed box that would hold sleeved (FFG sleeves) LotR LCG cards and other game components.  It would come with themed labeled dividers for all the types of cards and expansions (up to what is in print).  Future expansions would come with the appropriate dividers or they can be sold separately.  The box should be big enough to hold the base game plus a few cycles of expansions, generic enough to buy more boxes as needed, or themed for each cycle.

I am sure this has been said before and I like all the custom boxes people make, but I love FFG products.

I spoke with their CEO at Gencon and suggested just that as well as a themed play mat.  Obviously, its not their core competency so I suggested a partner, haven't seen or heard anything.

no that would suck.

They made a play mate for CoC and no one ever uses it. It "seams" cool.. but all it dose is restrict the way you do your table. Like will this playmate have enough space for all the encounter cards that may come out? How about victory piles.. do you use the same "shape" for solo and 2 player and 3 player? Will the hero area have enough space for 500 billion attachments on a single card?

All playmates do is make it harder to play the game
