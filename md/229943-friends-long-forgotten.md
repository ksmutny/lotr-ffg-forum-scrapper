Forums are pretty quiet as of late (probably in an anticipation of next spoiler article, which I hope is upon us), so I'll squeeze another one of those threads where I share my custom stuff. This time, it will be dedicated to extremely weak cards from the early days of the game. Cards so weak - they were considered weak even during those times, with extremely limited card pool.

 

I tried my best to stay true to those cards, while making them as useful, viable and competitive in the current environment as possible. Without further ado, I present you with first four:

 

sDc9au_sGss.jpg [https://pp.vk.me/c626731/v626731009/59474/sDc9au_sGss.jpg]

 

Original Common Cause felt like a waste of card slot. It gave too little for what it took. You gained 0 net action advantage from it. Sure, you could exhaust some Bilbo to ready Aragorn, but in the end, there are just better ways to do that (cough, Cram, cough). By making it a response to a hero being exhausted instead of making hero exhaustion a cost, I intend to bring this card back to life. However, as a card that will just ready 1 hero for 1 resource, I must add something else to make it enticing to include, which is conditional card draw.

 

 

rN5ReGyT7dc.jpg [https://pp.vk.me/c626731/v626731009/5947c/rN5ReGyT7dc.jpg]

 

Not much can be said about original Beorn's Hospitality, except for it was a huge overpriced overkill. And it targeted only heroes, which is another bummer. There is that cool host of events that does something awesome, but requires you to pay from 3 different heroes for it, and it currently misses a lore version, so I thought Beorn's Hospitality was a perfect match. (I also hope Beorn sees this.)

Lets be honest here. Original Power in the Earth is a joke. It's not just the weak effect, but also the fact that you need to have a location that stays in the staging area to use it. I tried to take care of both those problems by improving it's effect and making it reactive, sitting in the staging area until something fitting pops up.

Original Blade Mastery was lackluster at best. The only good target for it to this day seems to be the infamous T-Boromir, due to his endless action pool. A step in the thematic direction would be to make this event interact with a weapon, and good this the core box came with two different ones (both of which I modified in some way, and will show later on).

Blade Mastery is amazing, exactly what it should have been.

+1A/+1D should cost zero as it is such a small boost for one phase and the use of one card but this also provides a readying effect and the alternative cost is needing a weapon attached.

Its more thematic than the original (needing a weapon), easier to play yet not overpowered and is actually worthwhile playing thanks to the readying effect alongside the boost.

Common Cause would be an instant 3-of in my current Rohan deck. Keep making this stuff, it's good.

Leadership Rohan deck? That's hardcore, man.

 

Ok, another four I'm currently pretty sure about, before I leave for work, with a bit of thought process behind:

 

0X74p6t7Uek.jpg [https://pp.vk.me/c626731/v626731009/59506/0X74p6t7Uek.jpg]

 

Old Grave Cairn made you pay for an effect that usually means you just lost a board presence, plus it scaled with the attack of the character you lost, which was almost always a chump blocker with attack of 0 or 1, making it extremely hard to use. Sure, you could play it after a snaky Gandalf left play and get a nice boost of +4 attack, but that would pretty limited use of entire card slot in your deck. I made an attack bonus static to make it useful regardless of who's leaving play, and reduced the cost to 0 to compensate for the fact that it triggers off your misfortune, however I made it harder to trigger by modifying the response to only trigger from characters being actually destroyed or discarded from play, rather than just leaving play.

 

 

L91MlUaLAyE.jpg [https://pp.vk.me/c626731/v626731009/594ee/L91MlUaLAyE.jpg]

 

Lore of Imladris is a decent event, however you rarely need to heal any tremendous amounts of damage that your healing allies couldn't take care of. So I lowered the cost for it to be more appealing as an event, and added an additional kicker if you have any healer character and in a trouble with some nasty encounter condition.

 

 

3UPEdmzsV1A.jpg [https://pp.vk.me/c626731/v626731009/594e6/3UPEdmzsV1A.jpg]

 

The trouble for me personally in this card was always that it was too expensive and I'd rather play something else for 2 spirit resources. It was widely argued that willpower is more expensive than other stats and should cost more, and it is probably true, however nobody was seeminlgy willing to pay 2 for 1 willpower. So, I opted to reduce the cost, and to compensate for

the reduction I limitied it's availability to the quest phase only.

Tri-sphere, Eowyn Theoden (Spirit) Theodred. Since Theoden gets Steward and will always exhaust to quest and get Theodred's resource (all the while readying with Heir of Mardil), it's easy to pay 1 resource to ready Theodred for some attack or, best case scenario, ready Eowyn (if she doesn't have Snowmane) to defend with Golden Shield.

They all seem good except maybe power in the earth. I still don't think it's good enough and I personally don't like making it a "trap" for a location. Instead I would say "response:after a location is revealed from yhe encounter deck you may play this card from your hand" or something like that. Then, with -2 threat, it might be worth using, maybe.

Do those few Leadship Rohan allies cut it? What other Leadship cards do you use in that deck (cept for Heir of Mardil)?

Theodred's there to glue everything together. The only Leadership cards in the deck are x3 Heir of Mardil, x3 Steward, x3 Snoubourn Scout, x3 Valiant Sacrifice and x3 Sneak Attack, so as you can see it's the utility sphere, providing easy readying, resources and card draw, while Theoden gets to pay for almost everything else. Mind that this is still a sub-par archetype, but it's by far the best version I've come up with.

I double-checked, and there is no mistake.

This is perfect opportunity to showcase a couple of changes that most people will probably hate:

 

-7kDOZoVdRk.jpg [https://pp.vk.me/c631618/v631618009/51e37/-7kDOZoVdRk.jpg]

 

Aside from making him a good Secrecy fuel, I switched "enters play" to "play from your hand". Couple of reasons. First of all - it killed Sneak Attack's identity, making in completely one-trick pony, which is useful but generally not fun. Second, Gandalf response working with the Sneak Attack is not true to their own design, as there are plenty of less impactful effects on allies that are still getting the "play from your hand" treatment, while Gandalf didnt. Third of all - it's unfair that most wealthy sphere of the game gets the ability to reduce threat by 5/deal 4 damage/draw 3 cards for mere 1 resource. 

 

 

JbX7jQvHBUI.jpg [https://pp.vk.me/c631618/v631618009/51e70/JbX7jQvHBUI.jpg]

 

Now, to make up for the Gandalf+Sneak Attack combo I had to boost Sneak Attack itself, making it more useful during questing (with the ability to upquest if need be), and the general stat boost, so even weaker allies could become potent targets for Sneak Attack.

There is a mistake, but you're not the one who made it. That line was said by Galdor in the book, however it's misattributed on the original Power in the Earth card.

Updated the quote based on this, plus updated the card itself to make it more like Thror's Key, rather than a Trap.

For Power in the Earth:  I think it could be an attachment that gives -1 threat and -1 quest point.  That would allow it to explore a small set of locations outright (especially if stacked) and put a good number of them in range of Asfaloth or other location control effects.  I'd consider using it, even as an attachment.

 

For Sneak Attack:  I like what you're doing there, but I think I'd just simplify the text to give the stat boost alone.  The late quester clause is a great bonus, but I think it works fine without it.

In my book, making it -1 threat and -1 quest point will qualify the card to be the "Jack of All Trades, Master of None", -1 threat and -1 quest point wouldn't make it much different from the original version, and making it a setup from already extremely powerful card that is name dependent and from another sphere is a bit of overkill.

 

As for sneak attack, it works fine without it - it works even better with it, and it needs all the power it can get, because the big ol' Gandalf is not gonna do his nifty tricks with it anymore.

Well, just like as I said. People don't like losing power. But look at the bright side - with this change, there would be more than 1 viable target for this event.

 

As for Athelas - yes, crap, I forgot about them. Still, however, they are different types, and the exhaust healer to discard condition part on lore is purely optional, event remains the same otherwise (cept for cost of course).

But Galadriel has the "Play from your hand" trigger?..

 

I always considered Descendant of Thorondor to be awesome candidate for Sneak Attack, heavily overshadowed by existance of Gandalf and a fact that Leadership+Tactics is a rare union. By the way, Descendant of Thorondor got a willpower and health buff in my reworked version :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Does not the normal Sneak Attack card say "Put an ally into play from your hand"?

What about Spear of the Mark? +2 attack if character has a mount attachment is too powerful?

## 20 [PsychoRocka on September 15, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/229943-friends-long-forgotten/?do=findComment&comment=2415113)

Sneak attack puts her directly in play and is not you "playing her" from your hand. Someone else will do a much better job at explaining this properly. 

Also Spear of the Mark gives a character +1 attack (or +2 if attacking an enemy in staging). The card you are thinking of is Charge of the Rohirrim and it gives +3 attack to all rohan characters with a mount attachment. 

## 21 [PsychoRocka on September 15, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/229943-friends-long-forgotten/?do=findComment&comment=2415116)

If you could sneak attack Galadriel it would be way too powerful anyway. 

1 single leadership resource for Galadriel who contributes 3 willpower and can soak 2 direct damage during questing before dying AND a free attachment which could very well be StwB or Steward or something else that costs 2 or 3 resources AND you then get to choose the order of the remaining four cards on top of your deck......

all of that for one single leadership resource... far too good..

Spear of the Mark gives +1 attack (+2 if attacking an enemy in the stagging area). I always imagined this card as +1 attack (+2 attack if the character has a mount attachment).

I will check the faq of the game because I am confused with Sneak Attack. The card reads "Put 1 ally into play from your hand". Galadriel card says "after you play Galadriel from your hand..."

Yes, that would be more realistic. I don't remember if I made any changes to the Spear of the Mark (probably didn't), but I made a change to every mount in the game to read "Limit 1 Mount per hero." in addition to any other changes they might have had.

 

As for why Sneak Attack doesn't works with Galadriel - it's quite simple. Galadriel reads "after you play from your hand". Sneak Attack doesn't makes you play allies from hand, it puts them into play, which is a different occurrence in game terms. Card that is put into play by some side effect is not played from hand.

Not all of the cards I rework are in dire need, like the ones I initally posted. Sometimes it's just personal preference. Dwarven Axe is definetely not fine however, because it costs 2, unlike other weapons, while doing virtually the same, and it's completely overshadowed by the Dwarrowdelf Axe. Old Axe costed 2 while giving +2 attack exclusively to dwarves, Dwarrowdelf Axe gives +1 attack and does 1 direct damage (which is arguably stronger than +2 attack), costs 1 less, and is attachable to allies. For Dwarven Axe to be viable, it should cost the part, and benefit non-dwarves somehow. Which my version does.

 

Mirlonde change is purely due to strong presence of Silvan synergy in the lore sphere without a single Silvan Lore hero being a direct asset to that synergy (they all seem to do their random stuff). Mirlonde is the most fitting candidate in my eyes to be turned Silvan synergetic hero.

Oh!!! I really like the Silverlode archer. It would go straight into my Silvan deck! I am going to start downloading your cards, I may use them some day.

Ah, and I agree on the reduced cost for the axe

 

One thing though. I will make the cost of Blade Mastery equal to 1 as otherwise is way better than Behind Strong Walls. What do you think?

I love the art for Mirlonde and Dwarven Axe. Where did you get these pieces from?

Dwarven Axe looks insanely familiar, its from a larger picture of Gimli from some other FFG game right....?

As usual - google image search  :ph34r: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_ph34r.png]

 

As for axe - yes, it is from larger Gimli picture, however I haven't played any other FFG LOTR games, so I don't know where that art is from exactly.

Its definitely from something FFG....... I swear I have seen it before..... its a picture of him AND legolas side by side?

It was really hard for me to find a good dwarven axe art, so I had to sacrifice that awesome Gimli art to use it's axe part.

Why do you feel like changing Boots from Erebor?

 

One more question, I will make the cost of Blade Mastery equal to 1 as otherwise is way better than Behind Strong Walls. What do you think?

## 43 [DukeWellington on September 17, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/229943-friends-long-forgotten/?do=findComment&comment=2418470)

There is already an additional cost because you have to exhaust a weapon.

Because I've never seen anybody ever using or even mentioning them? +1 health for a dwarf of a hobbit feels like a huge waste of a card slot in a deck, and most decks are packed tight with the neat stuff already. To varrant a deck slot, card needs to pull it's weight. Also, boots that protect from the environmental hazards rather than just make you tougher felt pretty thematic to me.

 

As for Blade Mastery - what Duke said. My version of Blade Mastery initially had cost of 1, but it proved to be too expensive, given that you also need to have a weapon in play and you can only ready an armed character.

I actually prefer the original Boots from Erebor. It's free, Hobbits really need a bigger health pool, and some Dwarves like Gimli and Gloin make great use of them already. There's like 80+ decks on ringsDB that use the card.

 

My favourite changes are Blade Mastery, Silverlode archer, and Dwarven Axe.

 

Strength of Will has a terminology issue. Heroes don't "quest successfully", the players do.

I take that back!  :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] For the card itself, it seems like a more powerful Strider's Path, which is a little unfair. I think the hero readying puts it over the top.

 

The Boots are in some of my decks but I don't think I've made any videos yet.

 

I like the 3 cards I mentioned because they are synergistic with existing archetypes. I can imagine the decks they go in and can picture how they work.

While Strider's Path is a main card I was referring to while redoing Strength of Will, Strider's Parth immediately removes the revealed card from the staging area, lowering staging threat if the active location had lesser threat (or didn't existed at all).

My Strength of Will requires you to have a questing hero, and requires you to spend a resource from exactly that hero (which can be both plus and minus). Also, it requires that hero to be viable both for questing and for combat (thing unusual for Spirit in it's early eyars). 

 

Early version of Strength of Will was a 0 cost Travel Action that simply traveled to a location without resolving it's travel effect. However I was doubtful it would be significant enough to varrant a deck slot.

Holy scagsack, just finished with this one. It was a tough sumbeach to crack, coming up with something that will resemble original, while being viable and competitive (and I'm still highly unsure to be honest):

I've been looking for art pieces of jewels and I really like the one you used for Celebrían's Stone. Sure, it's not the same as in the books as there's no eagle, but I would have loved to use it when making my Sunstone of Lindon custom card.

If you're about the resource icon, then it's simple: I hate name specific card effects. I'd rather have card attach to two specific traits (which I made a background check for) than have it give something to one specific name.

 

If you're about discarding a copy to ready, then it's just a fun little theme for powerful unique artifacts I've came up with, nothing serious. 

## 56 [dalestephenson on September 22, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/229943-friends-long-forgotten/?do=findComment&comment=2426049)

I like name-specific attachments, as long as the attachments are usable outside the person name.  I like Snowmane and Herugrim -- both are excellent with Eowyn, but Theoden's price discount and lack of restricted make them *especially* good on him.  Celebrian's Stone I like -- most of the functionality is for everyone, but Aragorn gets a sphere as well (I think it also shouldn't be restricted for Aragorn).  Sword that was Broken I *don't* like, because it might as well just say "attach to Aragorn".  No one would pay 3 leadership to give a hero a leadership icon.  If the effects were reversed, and the card restricted to Dunedain, I'd like it better.

 

I noticed another recurring theme was to put "limit one mount per hero" on each of them.  I'm of two minds on this.  On one hand, I don't share the usual "can't ride two horses at one time" objection.  While you can't, historically warriors often *did* have multiple horses, which let them ride harder and longer by rotating mounts -- having two mounts give you more capability, just as having two weapons gives you more capability, even if you aren't technically likely to use them both at the same time.  On the other hand, most of the mounts in the game are Mearas, much more capable than historic horses, and from the text apparently used exclusively 1:1.  So it's at least thematic to restrict them, except that if only they were restricted to 1 mount they would be *less* valuable than non-Mearas mounts, which is exactly backwards.  Hobbit Ponies at least should not partake of the 1 mount restriction, they were not used exclusively for riding, and the four hobbits set out with *five* hobbit ponies.

 

When I get a chance I'll comment more on specific cards.

Tactics heroes:

 

Brand -- giving him 1 extra hp and the noble/warrior traits is a subtle benefit.  I like this Brand better, but he's still pretty useless for solo.  I wish he had something like "attacks and defeats an enemy not engaged with you, may ready any other character."  That would at least make him solo-friendly with Great Yew Bow.

 

Eagles:

Landroval -- while the new Landroval can save attachments from the rescued hero, he does so at a higher cost -- discarded instead of returning to hand, and leaving all the previous damage instead of setting to 1 damage.  Much worse in a Beorn deck.

Eagles of the Misty Mountains -- with a temporary instead of permanent boost from departing eagle, substantially worse.

Descendant of Thorondor -- by only damaging enemies in staging area, substantially worse.

Winged Guardian -- I like the design of this one better, in both the pay-or-discard only if he took no damage, the more substantial hp, and the 1 wp.  Going from 4 defense to 3 defense weakens, though.

Vassal of the Windlord -- first pure buff, since he's only discarded if the attack destroys an enemy.  I like it.

Support of the Eagles -- once per round, you get +1 wp/att/def if an eagle enters, and a +1 wp/att/def if an eagle leaves.  If no eagles enter or leave, you get nothing from your 2-cost attachment.  And you can only have 1-per hero.  It is cheaper, but the upside is much, much less.

Born Aloft -- so for a 1 cost attachment, you can return a non-eagle ally to hand in exchange for an eagle ally -- and "that ally" (the eagle, I presume) gets discarded at the end of the round.  I like the 0-cost original better, and I won't play it.  This is better thematically, though.  Couldn't the Eagle return to hand also?

Meneldor's Flight -- Returning an eagle (or more, if you lose a bunch) from the discard for 1 is much better than returning an in-play eagle for 0.  I like this one.

To the Eyrie -- discarding an eagle to prevent three damage to a non-eagle is a nice, thematic 0-cost event.  It's an inferior effect to the original, but the original is just to expensive (2 and an eagle exhaustian to retrieve an ally from the discard).

 

Overall, I like the improvements you've made to the Eagles cards I never play, but don't much care for the changes made to the Eagles cards I do play.  Eagles are the last faction I think of as overpowered, but the high upside from these expensive, fragile allies seems to have been entirely removed.

 

One last eagle-related card is Radagast -- by allowing him to heal anyone, but getting extra healing on creatures, his action goes from useless to worthwhile.  Inflating his stats from 2/1/1/3 to 3/2/2/3 also makes him worth playing outside a dedicated Eagles deck.  Vast improvement on the near-useless original.

(I haven't read what you wrote yet, I'll get right to it.)

 

About Descendant of Thorondor... he only got his willpower and health buffed, his text remained effectively the same.

Oops, sorry about the wrong thread.  You're right about Thorondor, I too hastily read the original.  Your version is strictly better and (I think) more appropriate for the cost.
