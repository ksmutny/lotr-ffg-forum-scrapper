first solo game first quest

I built a 30 card deck 8 lore 1 gandalf and 21 leadership cards

heroes were Theodred, Aragorn and Denethor

I had good attack and healing but could not get enough quest points and my threat hit 50

game over

just a couple of questions

I paid for the leadership attachment steward of gondor out of the leadership hero resource pool. Can I attach this card to Denethor?

Do enemies that are attacking me from last turn count their threat towards the next questing phase? Are they in the staging area?

Yes you can attach to any hero.

No they engaged with you and doesn count as a thread. Only enemies on the staging area counts.

If you want to play by the rules and build actual decks you have to use 50 cards per deck. The only way to play with less are ste standard starter decks.

Thanks for the feedback guys.

I think 30 card decks are quite challenging at the moment. When we have more cards out I II have a go at 50 card decks.

The steward of gondor card is great you can exhaust it every turn and give the attached hero 2 extra resourses a turn and with it attached to Denethor(the only Lore character I had) he ended up with more resources than both leadership characters.

Does the treachery web attachment card stay on your hero for the rest of the game?

 

thanks regards mic

Yes it does, unless you get rid of it with the Lore ally (Miner of the Iron Hill I thinkk) that can get rid of a condition.

 Actually (and this is a little funny) the shadow effect of Driven by Shadow can also get rid of Caught in a Web.

## 7 [SiCK_Boy on June 29, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49167-solo-game/?do=findComment&comment=492745)

Taken from the FAQ:

(1.06) Control of Non-objective Encounter Cards
Players do not gain control of encounter cards unless
control of the card is explicitly granted by a card
effect. When an encounter card (such as Caught in a
Web, CORE 86) becomes an attachment and attaches
to a character, that character’s controller does not gain
control of the attachment.

So you can't choose to sacrifice Caught in a Web because you don't control it.

That´s the funny part. The Forest Spider shadow effect (at least) specifies that you discard an attachment you control. Driven by Shadow, on the other hand reads:

Shadow: Choose and discard 1 attchment from the defending character(...)

Nothing about control.

Yes is quite funny northing to say about control......... Need to look on that closer....

I would assume that you dont own the attachment so cannot get rid of it.

dare I assume

by the way best card game I have ever played

I see your point with driven by shadow, but as (at least in the german version, don't know about the english v.) the text for an undefendet attack says you have to dicsard all attachments you control, I would read it the same way with defended attacks.

Yes it does say control for the undefended version, and I bet they intended that to be the case for the defended attack as well. But pointing out that little thing was kinda my point. Now let´s wait for the NEXT version of the FAQgui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]

Can the game survive the public?

Had a solo game,wiith my 9 year old daughter helping, and blitzed. We played the spirit heros starter deck and ended up with a score of 22

The deck has some great allies and a few good threat lowering cards, we were very happy.

Mind you it was quest 1

Quest 1 should be fairly easy, even with the basic decks. Though Tactics might struggle.

## 15 [MacBryce2 on June 30, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49167-solo-game/?do=findComment&comment=493510)

 Tnx for pointing that out, Felix.

I just played my first game (solo) with the tactics deck and I was about frustrated enough to throw the lot out of the window. I have spend around 7 turns without being able to make any progress on the first "flies & spiders" quest card. I did manage to get through one location card, but then one of the heroes got caught in the web and the best I could manage was to equal the opposing threat. A couple of frustrating turns without battles later, another location card landed that added 2 more threat points which I don't think I would ever get passed again.

Basically, this happened to me: http://conceptofprogress.wordpress.com/2011/05/20/lord-of-the-rings-lcg-to-slay-an-orc/ [http://conceptofprogress.wordpress.com/2011/05/20/lord-of-the-rings-lcg-to-slay-an-orc/]

So okay, I guess I'll give the game another try with one of the other decks. And hopefully other first time players will be warned about this, because it can really mess up your first impression of the game. It's just not fun to have a lot of locations, no enemies and a huge allied army that can't get you any progress. :-/

## 16 [felix16 on July 1, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49167-solo-game/?do=findComment&comment=493797)

Any of the others should do the trick well enough. Just hang in there and save the tactics deck for when you play with a friend.
