Hey there,

 

I have been wondering if The Hobbit expansions are worth getting? I have the core set and most of the Shadows of Murkwood series. From what I am reading the cards seem to be used just with the adventure and that era.

 

I figured I would drop a post to see what everyone thought about it

 

Cheers,

 

K

hey, i would post this in the main forum if i were you, so its more visible.

to your question- the hobbit boxes are certainly worth getting. they are some of the best boxes so far

 

the cards can obviously be used in any quest, not just the hobbit ones...and there are some really great ones that are worth getting even if you arent interested in the quests themselves.

 

if you have any questions, just ask

Hi Rich,

 

Thanks for the reply. I will toss it out in the main forum. I wasn't sure if you could as I had a look at the rule book and it talks about the tresure cards should only be used in the Hobbit Scenerios and mentions the time frame difference etc. So I wasn't sure if you could mix and mingle...
