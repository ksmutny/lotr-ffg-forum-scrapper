# [Printing Defect(?) with Ruins of Belegost](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/205437-printing-defect-with-ruins-of-belegost/)

Just received my copy of Ruins of Belegost and noticed this odd detail with the quest cards.

Normally a quest card is flipped horizontally to keep the A and B sides oriented correctly. That is, the titles are along the same edge of the card.

My RoB quest cards need to be flipped vertically for proper orientation. The card titles are on opposite edges.

I suppose this is a defect, but it's not a big deal. I'm more curious to know, does anyone else has this issue?

If it ends up being a bigger issue you may want to notify FFG's Lead Image Flippist.  I don't have his e-mail but found the staff photo:

Looks like an @$$hole

My pack had 4 copies of Cave Dweller [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Nameless-Cave-Dweller-TRoB] instead of 3.

Isn´t the encounter cards numbered? If so, do you have two of any number?

Me too. Looking on Hall of Beorn it says there's 44 encounter cards but mine all say x/45. I think it might just be a typo on there, unless someone with a GenCon version can confirm otherwise.

 

My quest cards are flip vertically rather than horizontally as well.

 

EDIT: Hall of Beorn pictures all say x/45 as well.

Yes, the 3x (instead of 4x) for Nameless Cave Dweller was an error in Hall of Beorn card search. It has been fixed.

I was sure that there never were more than 3 copies of an enemy in any encounter deck...  :huh: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_huh.png]

Looking over my notes, I see 39 enemies with 4-5 copies in the regular quests, and 17 enemies with 4-5 copies in the saga.  Doesn't look like there are enemies with 6 or more, though.

The Goblin Swordsman and Goblin Axeman from Khazad-Dum are definitely 5-of. The Nazgul from The Road Darkens have a few 4-of personae.

Wow... so, with 4 or 5 copies of enemies, it's like the encounters decks are cheating!!  :ph34r: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_ph34r.png]

And don't forget the appropiately named Cursed Dead.
