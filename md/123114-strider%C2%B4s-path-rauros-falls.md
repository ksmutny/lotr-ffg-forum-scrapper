So what i want to know is what happens if i use Strider´s path to travel Rauros Falls? Do i have to commit all my remaining charecters who aren´t already commited to a quest or just ignore Rauros Falls ability during this round?

Text on Rauros Falls applies when this location is active. So Strider's Path does not have any affect on Rauros Falls, because is not travel effect.

So you mean that Rauros Falls ability will activate then?

Oh, my bad. I don't read your question very good. I think, characters are commits to the quest only at the beginning quest phase and together. So I suppose Rauros Falls don't affect you this round.

Yeah, it wouldn't trigger until next turn when you have the choice to commit characters.  There are other encounter cards that force you to immediately commit characters to the quest and they have different text.
