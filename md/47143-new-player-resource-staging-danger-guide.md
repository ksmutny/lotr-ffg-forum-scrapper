# [New player resource: Staging &quot;Danger&quot; Guide](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47143-new-player-resource-staging-danger-guide/)

## 1 [TheLightdarker on May 21, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47143-new-player-resource-staging-danger-guide/?do=findComment&comment=472387)

So last weekend I was struck with a bit of sudden inspiration and had the idea to create a player resource that I had never come across before.  The goal of this document I put together is to serve as a convenient list of the different enemies and "when revealed" effects you're at risk of encountering each time you draw a card during Staging (based upon your current level of Threat), for each of the original three LotR LCG scenarios.

This is the first version of the guide, and I'm currently uploading v1.1 to fix some simple italicization errors.  Feel free to check it out at the following link, and I hope you find it helpful!  I'm very open to any suggestions as to how to improve it or make it more useful, and will be adding new sections to this living document as each new scenario is released.  Enjoy!

 Second quest is difficulty of 4, isn't it?  Good idea, thanks.

@Adam 

Oh, jeez.  Yep, you're completely right, I must have been thinking "scenario 2."

Edit: Currently working on a new version that will include the number of cards that possess each effect for every scenario, as well as adding another page that covers shadow effects.  Check back soon!

Alright, a vastly improved version is now downloadable from Boardgamegeek at this link:

A tremendous improvement over previous versions of the original "Staging Danger Guide," this document includes a detailed breakdown of not only the different Enemies and "When Revealed" effects that a player risks encountering during the Staging step of the Quest Phase (based upon their current Threat), but also a summary of all Locations, their associated travel effects, as importantly, all possible Shadow Effects players need to anticipate for every scenario. This file shall be a "living document," and will be updated as new scenarios are released. Check it out!

I kind of feel like this is cheating...

Hi!  Wanted to look at your guide, but it won't open.  Something about a page number being out of range.  I'm sure you'll get this resolved soon.  Thanks for making a game resource.

Hmmm, I'll try to see if I can figure out what the problem is (I saw the BGG posts too, thanks).

Thanks for letting me know about the errors with the file, hopefully I can see what's up...

Very interesting. I was wanting to see how this game plays at our local shop and I think this'll be an interesting resource.

Cheers.

 Okay, uploaded this with a different PDF maker.  Hopefully people that were having errors will now be able to view it with no problems.  I'll be adding Conflict at the Carrock sometime this weekend, probably.
