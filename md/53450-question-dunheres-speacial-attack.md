When you use Dunhere's special attack i.e. attacking an enemy in the staging area, if Dunhere does not kill that enemy, does that enemy attack him back?

Thanks!

 No.  The enemy is not engaged with anyone, and enemies never attack heroes, they attack players.  Also, Dunhere attacks an enemy AFTER engaged enemies have attacked.

One more thing.

Why would he be the only character that get attacked after he attacks an enemy?

No attacking character has to suffer retaliation. The ones that get to be beaten are the defending characters. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Um, how exactly does his function work?

Radiskul: you state that his ability can be used AFTER the enemies are done attacking but nothing in the rules or the FAQ (official and unofficial) says he can't use it right after the shadowcards are dealt. It's allowed for player actions right after this.

Just wanna be sure exactly how this works as I think it's really unclear. Nothing on the card says it can only be used in the attack fase, I only discovered that in the unofficial FAQ. And now it might only be specific after the enemy attact is resolved? Help please, I'm getting really confused sorpresa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sorpresa.gif]

Dunhere can only attack when characters can normally attack, i.e. when resolving player attacks. Unless you play a card that allows him to attack some other time, such as Quike Strike.

Usually, characters are only allowed to attack enemies that are engaged with you (from the rules about step 1 of player attack in combat phase: "A player does this by choosing 1 enemy with whom he is currently engaged, and exhausting any number of characters as attackers." )

So Dunhere's text is only allowing him to select other targets: targets in the staging area. (I think someone already mentioned this in the forums some time ago in another thread, but I can't remember who or where). It doesn't mean that he can attack in another phase. Dunhere is attacking after all enemies have attacked, just like all other of your characters do. This is because his attack cannot be used as an action (the bold action-trigger is missing).

Ah, okay. Thanks for clearing that up for me :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] Pretty logic actually if you think about it...which I obvious didn't gran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif]

 Also I came across a scenario when playing catc, dunhere attacked a troll, dealing damage, and he had the unexpected courage attachment.  Am I correct in assuming he cannot attack, then exhaust unexpected courage and attack again?  Due to the rules listing all attacks from players to enemies is one stage, followed by player actions.

 Dunhere can attack again, but he can not attack the same enemy a second time (FAQ).  The "player attacks" phase is green, so you can take actions (unexpected courage) in the midst of them.
