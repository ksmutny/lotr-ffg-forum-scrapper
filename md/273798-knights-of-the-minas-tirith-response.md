Hi Just a quick one. If you have already played knights of the minas tirith and you play another copy next round can both copies actions be triggered since the card action is Response: After Knight of Minas Tirith enters play, choose an enemy in the staging area. Engage that enemy and exhaust Knight of Minas Tirith to declare it as attacker (and resolve its attack) against that enemy.

I'd say you can only activate the response for each card that enters play.

 

Meaning, the already in play Knight of Minas Tirith cannot use his response...

 

From Rules Reference:

Self-referential

Abilities Self-referential abilities refer only to the card on which the ability is located, and not to other copies of that card.

 

From FAQ:

(1.31) Self-referential effects

If a card refers to its own title in its text it should be read as referring only to that copy of the card. A card that refers to other copies of itself will use the language “any copy of...” or “another copy of...” or “a card with the title...”

Thank you. I was living in hope ...
