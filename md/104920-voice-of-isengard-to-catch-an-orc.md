# [Voice of Isengard - to catch an orc](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/104920-voice-of-isengard-to-catch-an-orc/)

hi eveybody...

i have a question about the quest in the object:

I'm at the quest 3a 'The Wizard Prize who says:

 

Time 3. 

Forced: After the last time counter is removed from this stage, return Mugash to the staging area and reveal X encounter cards. X is the number of players in the game minus 1. Place 3 time counters on this stage.

 

Mugash is defeated.

the last time count is removed.

what happens?

I don't have to combat Mugash again.. right?

So what?

Mugash returns to the staging area and I have just to exhaust a hero of mine again?

what's the sense?

I suppose it is to contrast my quest and reach the 15 quest points, right?

would you please explain me the logics?

thanks! 

 

(how can you add a card in the topic to show it an help to understand the question?)

You do indeed have to engage and defeat him in combat again

Omigosh!!

So what's your strategy?

How il possible to defeat such a enemy?

8 lifepoints an defense 4...

I was able to defeat him whit aragorn gandalf (four damage and four attack points) theodred and eowin... together 

but if there are one or two orcs engaged... 

 

i have no idea to solve the situation...

One solution could be to wound him till he has just 1 or 2 hp and wait with the final capture till you have the progress assembled (so as to avoid his hp resetting). I would suggest using feint as well for that approach.

Good idea Nerdmeister.

 

I usually catch Mugash and win the game before timing count is triggered.

Mndela, how can you do that?

he attacks seven... impossible to do an undefend attack... and the three heroes are not so strong to kill him. So? How many ally are you able to play in a turn?

ho can you use your ally to attack him and put progress token on the quest?

i really find difficult to understand.

Nerdmeister, sorry, i'm from Italy and sometimes it's difficult to translate and understand..

what do you mean when you talk about progress assembled? (to reach the fifteen progress points? don't think you where intending this because mugash has to be assembled... to a hero to have your progress...) 

could you kindly explain in other words?

thanks again and sorry for my ... english!

Are you thinking i catch mugash in first round?

 

Very dificult to reach it. Mugash comes when you have explored some locations. When Mugash is in play and you win the quest placing progress tokens on the quest card, then, you pass to 3a-3b. In this round you must be ready for catching mugash, and you have 2 more rounds to place all the progress tokens you need in 3b to win the game. 2 rounds are ok for do it.

This quest have a one big flaw. Mugash come in the first 3 rounds 90% you lost. Mugash come later 90% you win. 

 

Check my youtube channel there is a game against Mugash. And Beorn deal with him very effective.

> to reach the fifteen progress points? don't think you where intending this because mugash has to be assembled... to a hero to have your progress...

Right you are. My memory did not serve me well there; though with the amount of different quests and card text with special rules it is bound to happen from time to time.

With a small change you can still use this general approach though: get Mugash to 1 or 2 hp, as I suggested and wait till he is returned to the staging area and take him out there with Gandalf, Descendant of Thorondor, Hail of Stones etc to max the amount of time you have to place progress tokens.

Here is Glaurung's video:

 





 

 

Here is my strategy:

 

Always keep a Gandalf in your hand! When Mugash appears, sacrifice one of your allies when he attacks. Next turn you play Gandalf, place 4 damage tokens on Mugash, try to make at least one progress (or not, if I still have all time counters left) and hit him with Gandalf plus some other good hitters. After that everyone but one characters quests. Here it helps to have the one or the other card that boosts your WP.
