Team Covenant had a picture on their Twitter and you can clearly see Black Riders expansion in it. They will have a video of it later today. 

 

Also the new the Hobbit Pipe card is pretty awesome. It is Spirit attachment. 

Cost: 0 

Attach to a Hobbit. Limit 1 per character.

 

Response: After your threat is reduced by an event card, exhaust Hobbit Pipe to draw a card.

they also spoiled a few more small details:

 

(SPOILERS)

 

4th black riders hero is fatty

 

apparently blood of gondor is avaliable there too (as if not going stung enough already) and the hero for that AP is a "gondorian female"  they give no other details

Good idea, but if it's anything like early-release Lego sets or figs, those eBay merchants will charge you both arms and both legs to get it before its official release.

I really like the fifth hero choice they went with; can't wait to see an image!

REALLY? That is a pity.

 

I daresay the decision was thus

 

"We want this to be playable with just the Core Set. Secrecy was initiated in a Quest cycle. 

 

Therefore adding Secrecy (and trying to balance it in) will not be worth our while"

 

I think it's a massively missed opportunity.

All of the cards are quite good (aside from Fatty sadly) and i love the art on Farmer Maggot; its better than what i feel i could have even imagined.  Merry is going to be slaying things left and right with that dagger!  Bill the pony's ability is just so great too; will likely always be free increases the health of the fragile hobbits and can contribute lightly to questing or attacking

## 21 [Nickpes on August 15, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88538-black-riders-available-at-gencon/?do=findComment&comment=840788)

It is like a dream come true ... All those hobbits and their abilities, FARMER MAGGOT !!!!! Bill the Pony , Fatty ... And ok, there is no secrecy, but there are two cards that lower the cost cause of hobbits, so it is near the same. I really can't wait...

## 22 [richsabre on August 15, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88538-black-riders-available-at-gencon/?do=findComment&comment=840789)

i have to say ive never liked the saga event cards. the ones in the hobbit i never use, and i would rather have an extra card in there

I agree completely rich, but maybe in the campaign mode they will be useful, so long as the quest doesn't make you spend baggins resources every round like in the Hobbit sagas.

 

Also, I'm not dissapointed by the lack of secrecy cards, but I do think that the secrecy cards we already have will be a lot more useful now with the hobbit heroes.

## 24 [Nickpes on August 15, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88538-black-riders-available-at-gencon/?do=findComment&comment=840797)

> All of the cards are quite good (aside from Fatty sadly)

 

Maybe Fatty is not that bad, apart from the well known cards that reduce threat, here are news ones (the two pipe cards) that can do the same, they are spirit as fatty, so maybe with a proper use Fattys ability can be very usefull 

## 25 [Bullroarer Took on August 15, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88538-black-riders-available-at-gencon/?do=findComment&comment=840806)

Also interesting that Bill is an Ally while Asfaloth is an Attachment.

## 26 [Karlson on August 15, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88538-black-riders-available-at-gencon/?do=findComment&comment=840816)

I gotta say, Bill the Pony is a perfect ally to back up the hobbits (and the fact that with Sam in play, he is free makes it even better!)   I really like how nearly all the hobbit-specific cards give an incentive to attack enemies with higher engagement costs than your current threat.  I do wish Spirit and Leadership would have received three unique player cards a piece like Lore and Tactics did, though.   At any rate, I guess I can officially start visualizing some fun hobbit decks now!

## 27 [GrandSpleen on August 15, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88538-black-riders-available-at-gencon/?do=findComment&comment=840825)

I'm diggin Fatty.  He is a repeatable Radagast's Cunning.  You just have to build your deck around threat-lowering options, which makes sense for hobbits anyway.

WOW!!!! This saga expansion is going to be epic!! Bill, Elf Stone, The pipe the tactics cards they are all amazing. Fatty seems interesting but i will likely go for the other three hobbits. I think the saga event card in this expansion is better than the hobbit ones. Anyway i can´t wait to get this cards!!

> I'm diggin Fatty. He is a repeatable Radagast's Cunning. You just have to build your deck around threat-lowering options, which makes sense for hobbits anyway.

Except Radagasts cunning doesn't require you to raise your threat, can be used more than once a turn, and doesn't make u exhaust a hero. (Although ur right it can be used on multiple turns)

I guess my hang up with Fatty is that I dont see the net gain of his ability as substantial. Your negating the threat cost of an enemy whom if they did count, you would what? Quest negatively and increase your threat any anyway? It is good if you are getting land locked and really need to clear a location or on that last stage of the quest and need just a few more points of progress, but I feel as tho those occasions are few and far between. The ability would have been nicer if it were response and not requiring to exhaust him although this can be easily mitigated with throwing a fast hitch on him.

If I'm also running lore I think I'd rather just use ithilien tracker. Much better

in multiplayer if someone is pulling off the wandering took/song of erandil combo, he may be of more use

I guess I was just expecting something better after the reveal of Sam, Merry, and Pippin. I'd still use him over spirit Pippin and the art is fantastic for what that's worth

So, I'm straying a bit off topic and into the future with this but here goes...

 

I normally play two-handed solo, so I am trying to think of all possible combinations to use for a nice duo of hobbit decks.  Now, I am assuming that the Black Riders version of Frodo will work similarly to the Hobbit saga's version of Bilbo in which the first player always takes control of Frodo; so, there's only going to be five unique hobbit heroes to choose from (Sam, Merry, Pippin, Fatty, and Bilbo.)  That's 1 Leadership, 1 Tactics, 2 Spirit, and 2 Lore.  (I counted Pippin as Spirit and Lore for both his versions.)  

 

Any ideas on combinations?  

 

Edit - When not playing the Black Rider quests, there's also the Spirit version of Frodo - which would make 6 hobbits altogether.

I think it depends on whether you're going to put Strider into play in your second hand or only two hobbitses.

## 34 [Teamjimby on August 15, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88538-black-riders-available-at-gencon/?do=findComment&comment=840875)

Hmm.  I think you'd have to go with Strider if you are trying to keep theme.  I think Faramir would work great, too.  Strider (or Faramir, or Mirlonde), Bilbo, and Pippin could make a mono lore hobbit/trap deck.  Then Fatty, Sam, and Merry could make the pure hobbit deck.  It would be better to have Sam and Pippin in the same deck, but the ability to run mono lore opens up a lot of options.

I know this is super quick but isn't Fatty just terrible, I mean just terrible, though a bit better with all the threat reduction I guess.

## 36 [Karlson on August 15, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88538-black-riders-available-at-gencon/?do=findComment&comment=840878)

> I think it depends on whether you're going to put Strider into play in your second hand or only two hobbitses.

That's true.  There's many heroes that could be paired with the hobbits for thematic decks.  Strider, Glorfindel, etc.

 

For strictly hobbit decks, I'm thinking Samwise, Frodo, and Fatty (1 Leadership, 2 Spirit)... and Merry, Pippin, and Bilbo (1 Tactics, 2 Lore)  That's just an idea.   I'd most likely replace Bilbo with Strider to add to the theme, though.

 

## 37 [Karlson on August 15, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88538-black-riders-available-at-gencon/?do=findComment&comment=840885)

> I know this is super quick but isn't Fatty just terrible, I mean just terrible, though a bit better with all the threat reduction I guess.

Personally, I don't think Spirit Frodo is that great either.  I was just brainstorming ideas of how to make all-hobbit themed decks, regardless of their playability.    

 

In all honesty though, I prefer a healthy mix of theme and playability because a fun theme is always nice but if it can't beat most of the quests, what's the point?

And isn't Elfstone just what mono-Lore decks needed? All those 3+ cost allies could enter play much cheaper this way,,,

i made a deck when the hobbits were previewed that took advantage of pippins throw back ability, sams boost and son of arnor

Elf Stone is more remarkable for mixed-sphere decks I think.  If you're playing a mono-Lore deck it isn't as hard to put Haldir, Gildor, etc. into play because you have enough resources but if you're playing a deck that only has 2 or even 1 Lore hero, it would take forever to save up to buy those allies.   Elf Stone is just a great card - the only way it could be better would be if it were Neutral in sphere.

If solo I think the best bet is keeping Sam, Merry, and the new Pippin together and just throwing some songs of travel for the pipe cards. They just work so well together. If playing two decks you could have a very thematic play thru by keeping deck 1 the same as listed above and making deck 2 Fatty, Strider, and Glorfindel (spirit). This would literally represent all the main players in the first half of the fellowship.

If your intent is to make it as hobbitty as possible and include bilbo I think I would make deck 1 Sam, lore Pippin, and Bilbo and deck 2 Fatty, Merry, and spirit Glorfindel. (Giving Glorfindel to some of his tactics elf toys like rivendell blade and maybe rivendell bow) you could also throw attachments across the table like fast hitch, hobbit cloak, and blade of westernese

(All for playing the saga quests where frodo isn't available)

Ah, Spirit Glorfindel... He gets around in all my Middle-earth decks, let me tell you.   Now he actually fits into the theme though!  (unless you're going for a movie-based theme, and in that case I'd have to ditch Glorfindel altogether and throw in all my Arwen ally cards.)

i dont believe so; in the original article for the black riders box it said we would get 33 new player cards (3 copies of 11 cards).  Thats precisely how many were spoiled

I just can't see how Fatty is going to be useful, short of being that "unwanted friend" you invite to the party just to get enough people there... in this case, in order to play multiple Hobbit decks at the same table.

 

Even with all the threat reduction Spirit has, it makes no PRACTICAL sense to waste a hero's action to simply offset the same amount of threat from an enemy.  At that point, now you are including additional cards (although you are probably using them anyway) to compensate for his poor ability.  (as an additional thought, the new hero spoiled elsewhere kind of falls into the same following thought:)  I am REALLY hoping that FFG is pre-empting some good cards that will play off these abilities (retrieving heros from the discard pile, responding to Fatty's threat increase, etc) and that we are just seeing the "first step" of a better combination.

Sadly, it wouldn't have taken much to make Fatty fairly playable.  Adding an additional line that said, "Players make no engagement checks against that enemy this turn." would've at least given you an actual BENEFIT to using Fatty's ability, AND would've paired nicely in the "evade" concept (and would've paired great with Faramir!).

Pipe item with an event keyed into the pipe keyword is the best part of this.

I look forward to seeing that expanded as the card pool increases. 

I'm also really pleased with the decision to make the hobbits best when taking on threats bigger than themselves, I think this really captures the hobbits of the books (as a race) while also creating a new play style. I like that the hobbits also get weaker over time (as threat rises, their ability to compete reduces), to balance out their big start. Looking forward to hobbit decks.

And the dagger can be played on anyone, and it is just restricted, it goes well for many heroes, even good old Dúnhere with two of these can take down many fiends.

 

But I like the above given line-ups, hobbits and Glorfindel and Strider, very thematic and likely super strong, so many good cards there.

Great point with Dunhere, funny how just the other day he was oft being mentioned as the worst and most useless hero, he can suddenly become relevant again thanks to these westernese blades.  Attacking with a total of 7 will be quite useful

> If solo I think the best bet is keeping Sam, Merry, and the new Pippin together and just throwing some songs of travel for the pipe cards. They just work so well together. If playing two decks you could have a very thematic play thru by keeping deck 1 the same as listed above and making deck 2 Fatty, Strider, and Glorfindel (spirit). This would literally represent all the main players in the first half of the fellowship.

True, but would you rather have an extra attack point from merry or an additional 3 from strider? Merry has to attack with another character for his ability to ready that character. I think Strider is a pretty good candidate. I think Beorn would be the only one better.

For a strange thematic experience, one can have Dúnhere, Éowyn and Merry. Of course Merry wouldn't get to do much but questing, but starting at 23 threat, having 6 willpower questing right away and Dúnhere hoping for the Daggers, it seems nice. Plus you have the easy access to the Pipe and Smoke Rings (not to mention GalaGreet). And once in a while, when you don't need to quest with Merry, and you do need to engage an enemy, Merry can kill it with Dúnhere, and ready him for another attack into the staging area.

This elfstone seems to be the best monosphere supporting card. Play monolore with beorn, northern tracker etc.

4-6 weeks...  That is too long to wait.  

 

I just hope to have it by September 22nd so I can celebrate Bilbo's and Frodo's birthday by questing with all the hobbits.

Staging is done in Black Riders per player so Hide X (eg. Hide 2) will only effect the player who is currently revealing the encounter card (written as "you" on the cards). When a hide card is revealed a player action window is opened and the active player can exhaust and commit any number of characters (including zero) to the hide test. X cards are discarded from the top of the encounter deck and all of the threat values of those cards are added up. If the total threat of discarded cards exceeds the total willpower of all characters committed to the hide test, then the hide test is failed. Otherwise the player has successfully remained hidden. Failing will cause all Nazgul in the staging area to immediately engage the active player (the one who failed the hide test). Other negative effects will so trigger when a player has failed a hide test (e.g. nazgul making an immediate attack, shadow cards with increased effects if the defending player failed a hide test that round, etc.).

Right now I consider Fatty to be a promising candidate for the next worst hero award. Eleanors (useless) stats and basically no ability. The art is nice for what that's worth.

Fatty is IMO intented to be the Hobbit defender.  His ability sounds like an emergency action if things go awry, but it's not very important. His stats are the trick.  He's the only Hobbit with 2 DEF beside Frodo. Furthermore he has 3 HP. Surely he's going to be played. Unlike Frodo you don't have to raise your threat when a 4 ATT enemy attacks you.

 

His ability, well, doesn't sound very cool to me. It's hard to judge how helpful it might be before playing a Hobbit deck first. I could imagine though that these decks allow you to lower your threat beyond 10 points. If all enemies have a threat of 20+, well, his ability doesn't sound that bad. However, in solo mode it still seems to be bit of a waste, but then we already have Fast Hitch to increase the Hobbit's flexibility.

 

When playing multiplayer his ability is ability makes more sense. One player plays a Hobbit deck, the other has a battle deck. Hobbit player can thus reduce threat in the staging area by a hight threat enemy, and the battle deck player engages that enemy later in combat phase.

Hey yeah, completely forgot about him. After playing that combo you mentioned multiple times. However, Fatty's the defender. if you don't use Bilbo or Sam, but a Hobbit/spirit deck.
