Greetings my dear fellows,

 

I have my cards sleeved in the LOTR-themed  FFG sleeves, and I'm wondering if anyone know of any binder inserts that would fit the cards while they are sleeved? I'd much prefer a binder over a box, but I can't afford to experiment with the inserts unless I know they will fit. Has anyone done anything similar with their collection?

Doubt it. FFG sleeves do not fit the cards as snugly as binder pages do.

I use FFG sleeves (clear sleeves) and I have a few Ultra Pro Premium Pro Binders. The sleeved cards fit nicely in the sideloaded pockets. You can easily fit 2 sleeved cards per slot, but 3 is pushing it. But the binders are fixed with no room to add new pages, so I don't know if it would fit your needs as you did mention binder inserts.

Fun fact: I used to think of binder as some diabolic machince that is used to shred paper, and useless cards in particular. Mainly because people referenced new useless cards as "binder fodder".

I have all my Mage Wars cards in mostly FFG sleeves, and they fit nicely in the official spell books. Not sure who produces them, but they're pretty similar to the small Ultra Pro binders.

UltraPro binders and Trading Card binder pages have always fit my FFG sleeves.

 

Though with so many LotR LCG cards, I just keep them all in an artist box.
