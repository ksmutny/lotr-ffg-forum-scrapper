So for those of you who were fortunate enough to pick up a copy at Gen Con, and for everyone else once Hall of Beorn/CGDB is updated; here are some of my best encounter decks for competitive mode. I'm happy this format is so fun cooperatively, too. I'll post my "decks" one at a time so as to avoid walls of text.

 

Location Lock deck:     Quest stages are A Fork in the Road and the Sorcerer's Tower

1 Ravenous Spider

1 Spider of Dol Guldur  These two spiders are here to provide some sort of boss enemy as the players focus on locations. They were the ones that mesh with the general strategy the best.

2 Dark Bats

3 Eastern Crows

2 Forest Flies  These help to generate more locations and provide a little combat as well

1 Goblin Sniper  Another card to lock up the staging area. Tough to deal with as well

2 Forest Stream

3 Pine Slopes

1 Twilight Hall

2 Oak-Wood Grove

1 Sorcerer's Tower   All of these are staple locations in a deck like this

1 Patch of Midnight   Adds to complexity of locations and confuses the players

1 Hunter's Lookout

2 Pitch-Dark Thickets

2 Necromancer's Pass     these last three round out the suite of locations

2 Under the Shadow

2 Nightfall

1 Power Sevenfold     Just lots of general nastiness

1 Treacherous Fog

1 Fastness of Mirkwood   These can wreck the players in a location lock deck

3 Eyes in the Dark

1 Weighed Down    To round out the deck

 

What do you think? And what do you think about the format in general? Will RingsDB integrate this format? Will FFG provide organized play?

Here's a boss enemy deck. There are lots of ways to put more big enemies into play. The quest stages are a New Terror Abroad and Return to Rhosgobel. And we thought dwarf swarm was powerful.

 

2 Dark Bats

3 Eastern Crows   These are here just to chain into other enemies.

2 Hill Trolls

Spider of Dol Guldur

Bane of Amon Lanc

Nazgul of Dol Guldur   These are the main bosses.

Dol Guldur Beastmaster

Necromancer's Warg

Ravenous Spider

Goblin Sniper    These round out the collection of tough enemies.

2 Befouled Equipment

Weighed Down  These are to counter a super voltron hero.

2 Restless Hunters

2 Smoking Blood

2 Pursued by Shadow    These are all great with big enemies.

Under the Shadow

Swarming Mosquitoes   These two are in just to get to the treachery minimum.

2 Pitch-Dark Thickets

2 Forest Gates

Shadow Road   These are good locations in a deck with lots of enemies

2 Watched Paths

Patch of Midnight

Troll Cave    These help generate more enemies

Forest Stream     To round out the deck

I have a couple of nasty Wizard's Quest decks that I put together at the Con but never properly got a chance to try out. It's cool thinking about encounter decks the same way that I think about player decks; trying to find synergies and stuff.

Cool! Mind sharing?

Here's a deck focused on direct damage and threat raising. It directly assaults the players. The quest stages are Carried Away and Dungeons of the Necromancer.

2 Dol Guldur Orcs

2 Forest Flies

Goblin Sniper

3 Eastern Crows

2 Hunting Wargs    Those Wargs are here just to provide a little meatier combat

Twilight Hall

Patch of Midnight'

Sorcerer's Tower

2 Forest Stream

2 Necomancer's Pass

3 Pine Slopes

3 Eyes in the Dark

Weighed Down

2 Nightfall

2 Befouled Equuipment

2 Necromancer's Reach

Power Sevenfold

2 Swarming Mosquitoes

Evil Storm

Under the Shadow

 

Do you guys think FFG will support organized play for this format? Does anyone know of a deckbuilder that plans to integrate this?

I hope so, I love the idea.

I just finished a blog post on this quest, complete with a few decklists of my own:

It's actually really fun to build encounter decks. I enjoy both the advanced-build and quick-build rules, too, they're each fun in different ways.

Cool article, @Authraw [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/229935-authraw/]! Thanks for the head's up.

Here's a deck with a Warg theme. The quest cards you use don't matter, just play to your opponents' weaknesses. The idea is to bounce enemies around and generally foul up the encounter phase.

1 Dol Guldur Orc

Goblin Sniper

Spider of Dol Guldur

Dol Guldur Beastmaster

Necromancer's Warg

2 Hunting Warg

3 Howling Warg

Ravenous Spider

2 Venomous Spiders

2 Oak Wood Grove

3 Pine Slopes

Hunter's Lookout

Shadow Road

Wargs' Glade

2 Pitch Dark Thicket

2 Forest Gate

Evil Storm

Power Sevenfold

Under the Shadow

Weighed Down

2 Nightfall

2 Restless Hunters

2 Pursued by Shadow
