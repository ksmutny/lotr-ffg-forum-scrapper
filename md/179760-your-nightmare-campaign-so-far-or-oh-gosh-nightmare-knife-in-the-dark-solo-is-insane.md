How have your experiences been with the Nightmare version of the campaign? Here is my campaign report below. I used an Elrond-free and Eagle-free (though sadly not Glorfindel-free) Gandalf deck and I went pure solo.

 

Nightmare A Shadow of the Past - 137

Score: 10 rounds, 39 threat, 2 victory points, 0 damage

Heroes: Gandalf (Neutral), Aragorn (Lore), Glorfindel (Spirit)

Earned: Mr. Underhill, The Ring Draws Them

Thoughts: The nightmare version of this scenario isn’t too different from the normal version. That being said, the 3 new Nazgul make this quest much more combat-focused then before, and the Hide X value is generally higher than I’m used to. Khamul doesn’t pose much of a problem since he comes out right at the end and his engagement cost is 40.

 

Nightmare A Knife in the Dark - 202

Score: 16 rounds, 44 threat, 7 victory points, 5 damage

Heroes: Gandalf (Neutral), Aragorn (Lore), Glorfindel (Spirit)

Earned: Tireless Ranger (attached to Gandalf)

Thoughts: Oh man. The fight on Weathertop is insanely difficult without the right cards. This required some very specific deckbuilding. When stage 3 is revealed, assuming no Ringwraiths were shuffled in, 6 cards are immediately added to the staging area, worth 25 threat in total! (Weathertop = 4 threat, The Witch-king = 5 threat, 2 Menacing Wraiths = 4 threat each, 2 Riders of Mordor = 4 threat each). Plus, if The One Ring ever exhausts, whether by traveling to Weathertop or cancelling an attack or whatever, everyone will engage if your threat is 25 or higher. The following cards are absolutely essential to victory in this solo scenario: A Elbereth! Gilthoniel! and Helm! Helm! + Snowbourne Scouts/Horse-breeders for instant enemy discards; Ever Onward or Doom Hangs Still to avoid questing against the 25 threat.

 

Nightmare Flight to the Ford - 102

Score: 7 rounds, 32 threat, 3 victory points, 3 damage

Heroes: Gandalf (Neutral), Aragorn (Lore), Glorfindel (Spirit)

Earned: Eaten Alive!

Thoughts: This is an extremely easy quest in Normal/Easy Mode, so I thought this quest would be a pushover. Nope. All except 4 of the cards from the unchallenging Flight to the Ford encounter set have been pulled (the 4 remaining being 2 copies of The Nine Are Abroad and 2 copies of The Enemy is Upon Us!) and replaced with game-ending treacheries [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Come-Back-FttFN]. A successful deck for this quest has to be hitting hard from Turn One.

 

Campaign Pool

Boons: Mr. Underhill, Tireless Ranger

Burdens: The Ring Draws Them, Eaten Alive!

Has anyone else played the nightmare campaign?

I bet few have! Glaurung has surely played it or is at the least waiting for it to arrive  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

I'm going to wait until at least one or two more nightmare saga packs are released then get them all at once.

I have to say just from your brief write ups about your experiences they sound harder than I first anticipated especially A Knife in the Dark.

I'm in no rush to get them either just because I want all of them so I'll get them whenever my store happens to finally get them in

I've played all the nightmare sega quests, but not in campaign mode yet. A Shadow of the Past is really tough if Khamul shows up before stage 3, but otherwise it is fairly easy.

A Knife in the Dark is really tough but probably one of my favoret nightmare quests. I have always had a blast with boss encounters, and the new Weathertop and Nazgul make this quest a blast to play.

Flight to the Ford is difficult and it is very easy to have 3 or more Nazgul in play at a time. Every win I have had against it has been with Frodo only having 1 life left.

I played through all the quests with a Galadriel, Glorfindel, and Treebeard deck that focuses on readying Treebeard so he can do everything.

I folded and ended up getting Nightmare Black Riders rather than waiting for more nightmare saga to be released first. I'll give it a try in the near future and post my results =)

Nm for Black Riders was very awesome. All the quests were very difficult and took some tinkering with strategies to pass. Knife in the Dark is still the best.

Has anybody noticed how good can mono sphered decks for pure solo play can be for Nightmare quests?

At least open Treason of Saruman and try Helm's Deep. Without the right deck, that quest is a lot harder than some nightmare quests!
