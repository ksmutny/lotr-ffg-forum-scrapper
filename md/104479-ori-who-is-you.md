I'm sure this question has been answered but after searching the forums, I couldn't find one.  If you're using Ori or any of the other dwarves that have the "If you control at least 5 dwarf characters, do this..." ability with two or more players, does only the owner of the Ori count their dwarves or can more than one player count their dwarves towards earning the ability?

Only the person controlling Ori should count his/her own dwarves, no other players'.

That is how I was interpreting it but I wanted to make sure.  Thanks for the help GrandSpleen! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
