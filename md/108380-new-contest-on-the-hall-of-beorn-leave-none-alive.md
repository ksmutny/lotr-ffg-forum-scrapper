For those interested in winning a copy of the Nightmare Deck for Khazad-dûm, I am running a contest on my blog. Leave a comment about your most epic round - the most enemies you've killed or the most interesting way you killed them. The winner gets a copy of the latest Nightmare Deck shipped right to their door. Good luck!

Cool stuff Dan!

I remembered one case in particular right away when reading the contest that really qualifies.

Was multi-player vs WitW.

Don't have time for a nice write-up on it now though. :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

Hopefully tomorrow!
