I made a big document with relevant questions & answers that doesn't appear in the 1.7 faq and here's the result.

FAQ 1.7 - 17/03/2015 [https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bx7NeM1v9YOndk0zaG5hMnZ0b2s/view?usp=sharing]
Printer friendly version [https://docs.google.com/document/d/18_pYjnXi27r1P886cMHGmb7ZX-tuWeTLe7bGIVP-vs4/edit?usp=sharing]

Feel free to give feedback and point out questions I could have missed.

It contains a lot of questions our french community asked and were never translated to english until now.

Updated :

- 4 more entries.

- spellcheck

- sources

 

With sources added, you will see that our french community asked a good number of questions... You might want to check them. I suspect that there may be communities in other languages with questions we could have missed.

 

- would you like me to add username of the asker ? Now that source were added, you can check for yourself. But it might be nice to have a contributor list.

- would you want to see more lotr artwork ?

Great work :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] ! Sources are very helpful.

 

Username is not essential and the layout is very good as it is now - no more graphics needed, but that's only my opinion.

 

Keep on updating it!

I agree. It's a great piece of work.

 

Personally, I agree with krokodiler and I would leave it as it is - just update it as and when new queries are answered.

 

Thanks alogos!

Great document. You could also add a printer friendly version removing the background and the first page.

Or you could copy paste all the text in notepad and print it ?

That's why I did for the Lotr Rulebook. Had to remove the silly collumn layout with a macro though...

cardgamedb forum has like 4 pages worth of nate and Caleb answers are these the same?

A lot come from there, I skip some very few unimportant one.

A lot also come from our french forum, and the remaining is me following both bgg and ffg forum.

Then a lot from cgdb comes from the bgg/ffg forums...

The key is to bring them all, and in the darkness bind them...

New update with 8 new entries, Some of them are... weird and mostly concern AP 5 and 6 of numenor and immunity.

Some are from the french forum, so make sure to read them.

New update with 20 new entries.

 * Deleted duplicate entries with the official faq.
 * Added old questions I missed since the beggining.

As some are from the french forum I'll start putting them here in spoiler for those you already follow BGG and this forum :


- when engaging Zealous Traitor with Hammer Stroke you didn't optionnaly engaged him
- when a card gain surge in his when revealed effect, you can use Minas Tirith Lampwright
- when revealing a card from your deck with Hunter of Lamedon, it is still in your deck and it would proc hidden cache.
- when using saruman, the cards is considered out of play, but also everything attach to it.

 

The printable version is a up to date as it is a google doc, the pdf will be updated tonight (GMT+1, in 5 hours).

 

Are there other communities / forums that are asking questions to Caleb and are not visible here ?

Perhaps you'd like to cross-check with this:

That what it was based on. Didn't check if there was something new, but they just did the same as me, collect from here and bgg.
