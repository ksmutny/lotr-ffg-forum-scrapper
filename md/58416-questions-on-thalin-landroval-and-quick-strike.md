Hiya all,

I'm a newbie to LotR: The Card Game.  Have a few questions I want to ask with regards to the Tactic cards.  Hope you can help.

Q1. Eastern Crow and Thalin

 What happened if Eastern Crows was revealed and I have Thalin committed to the quest? Thalin’s ability said, “While Thalin is committed to a quest, deal 1 damage to each enemy as it is revealed by the encounter deck."  Would the Eastern Crow automatically be destroyed before its ‘surge’ effect takes place or would ‘surge’ comes be activiated once revealed before it was destroyed?


Q2. Landroval and Destroyed Hero
When a hero is destroyed, if it is put back into play using Landroval’s effect and the hero was previously exhausted before it is destroyed, would it return to the board as exhausted or unexhausted.

For example: Beravor was exhausted in order to give a player the opportunity to draw 2 cards. She only had 1 life left and then Evil Storm was revealed during the Encounter Phase. The player who was controlling Beravor had more than 35 threat points and therefore had each of his character received a damage. Beravor was damaged and destroyed. Would Beravor be put back into play ‘unexhausted’ using Landroval’ ability or would it return following the condition she was in before she was destroyed? (Note: I have a combination of Lore and Tactic sphere in my deck and therefore it has both Landroval and Beravor.)
 

Q3. Quick Strike
a. Can I use Quick Strike to exhaust a hero to attack an enemy at the staging area? If yes, this can be very useful in getting rid of…
- Hummerhorns (from Spider of Mirkwood)
- Goblin Snipers and Wargs (from Wilderland)
… at the staging area.

b. Also, when using Quick Strike on an enemy engaged with a player, must we still deal it with a Shadow Card for the purpose of running through the deck? This idea was a result from some discussions that say even though an enemy cannot attack the player’s heroes or allies through card effects (such as ‘Forest Snare’, ‘Feint’, and ‘Thicket of Spears’), Shadow Card will still be dealt to each enemy.

Q1 - Thalin's ability resolves before any keyword or when revealed card effects on an enounter card. See the FAQ for the written version.

Q2 - Since the hero was destroyed then returned due to an ability the hero would come into play unexhausted. The Landroval card does not specify but merely says "after a hero is destroyed". Once destroyed they leave play so when coming back into play the card should be unexhausted unless specifically told to have it in another state.

Q3 - Quick Strike cannot be used to attack an enemy in the staging area. Also, enemies are only dealt shadow cards immediately at the beginning of the combat phase. If quick strike is used in another phase then there would be no shadow card. If used in the combat phase then the enemy would indeed have a shadow card. All enemies are dealt shadow cards (even those feinted or snared).

Hope that helps!

Interesting. I was not aware that you could attack outside of the combat phase. I assumed quickstrike had to be used in the combat phase, it just gave you the benefit of attacking first, and possibly killing your enemy before he could get his attack.

 

Can you really quick strike during any phase?

 If Quick Strike were intended to be so limited, it would say Combat Action: instead of Action:.  So yes, you can play it in any phase.

Valid point. Thank you.
