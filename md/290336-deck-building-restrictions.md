1.Can you include cards from a sphere outside your characters' sphere in your deck? 

Example: Bow of Yee is a 0 cost resources, can you include in a deck with no Tactics heroes? What about cards with a resource cost (Warrior of Dale)?

2. King of Dale- does that ally not need a resource match just from the equipped hero, or any hero?

Example: Playing Warrior of Dale while Bard has King of Dale. Can another non tactics hero contribute resources?

The only restrictions are that you can't have more than three copies of a card in a deck. Remember that in order to play a 0 cost card, you do still need a hero matching the cards sphere but if you have some other way of getting it into play more power to you.

 

If a card doesn't need a sphere match, it doesn't need a sphere match and it doesn't matter where the resources come from.

Thank you!

So with Bard's ability you could play Bow of Yee without a Tactics hero, but you couldn't play that card in say a Lore Rangers deck

Im just getting into the game myself after playing with some friends' decks

Okay sorry for the follow-up. So in a deck with Brand, Bard, and one other leadership/spirit hero you COULD play tactics items due to Bard ability and Warriors of Dale due to King of Dale, but you could not play a tactics event like Valour of the North (0 cost)?

Correct, unless one of your heroes acquired the tactics sphere via some player card effect.  (For example, 1-cost neutral attachment Song of Battle does nothing but grant Tactics sphere).
