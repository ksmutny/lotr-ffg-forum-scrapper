ok i know this has been asked months ago, ive tried to find it but nothings come up

 

ok card 2b, i have an unguarded clue in the staging area, i quest successfully beyond the required amount (lets say i need 3 to progress and i win by 5) the q. is, does timing rules allow me to claim the clue before placing the tokens, therefore preventing the quest resetting as i didnt have any clues as i went to 3b.

i was just playing this and had a memory blank...these timing rules are giving me a bad head recently, im pretty sure you can claim it, as questing sucessfully and placing progress tokens are 2 different actions

 You are said to have quested successfully before tokens are placed, so yes, you could trigger the response before you go on to the next stage.
