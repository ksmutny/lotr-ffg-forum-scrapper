Hello Everybody! Welcome to The juicebox LOTR LCG Top Ten Hall of Fame. Every time I host a tournament, it concludes with a Top Ten listing that ranks players who finished the tournament with the top ten best results. What follows here is an ongoing (living, if you will) compilation of all of the Top Tens from all completed tournaments.

Hall of Fame placements are scored as follows: in each tournament a #1 ranked placement earns the participant 10 points, a #2 ranked placement earns the participant 9 points, a #3 ranked placement earns the participant 8 points, and so on all the way down to a #10 ranked placement earning the participant 1 point.

As every ranked placement counts toward that participant’s overall grand total, the Top Ten Hall of Fame reflects the current listing of the ten grandest of all grand totals. Nice work Hall of Famers! You’re an inspiration to us all!

With two Solo Player Tournaments complete and in the books, the Top Ten Hall of Fame begins to take on a slightly more dynamic shape and flavor. Congrats to all who remain ranked!

Special congratulations to wraith428 who remains atop the Top Ten Hall of Fame for two weeks running! Nice job wraith428! aplauso.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/aplauso.gif]

And a moment of silence for Scoob, who has fallen from the hallowed rankings. llorando.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/llorando.gif]

For those of you interested in joining the fray, check out the current active tournament [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=582949]… a 2 Player Tournament featuring Escape from Dol Guldur.

Good show everybody.

With our third Solo Player Tournament complete, the new tally is in…

And in dramatic fashion, with only an hour and twelve minutes to spare in the third Solo Player Tournament, wraith428 pulls out a result to keep him on top of the Hall of Fame standings for an impressive third week in a row!

Truly, a remarkable job wraith428!

Also, for the sake of all things decent, let us take a moment of silence for the one and only ClydeCloggie, as he has suffered the misfortune of falling from the Hall. llorando.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/llorando.gif]

But will he work his way back in? The end of next week (with an unprecedented two active tournaments drawing to a close at the same time) should make for some pretty exciting Hall of Fame activity.

So stay tuned… the plot can only thicken from here. babeo.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/babeo.gif]

 Hey Juicebox, would you consider putting up an overall ranking at the end of the mirkwood series so everyone can see where they rank?  Thanks!

I've been thinking about this... like maybe after the Top Ten in the Hall of Fame I could include an Honorable Mentions list that would reveal the rest of everyone's overall rankings. Personally, I do think that would be fun. It would let people know how close they are to being promoted to the Hall of Fame Top Ten or to being relegated to the Honorable Mentions, and it would also showcase the success of new players to the tournaments. After all, over time, those of us who have been playing and getting results from the beginning will have an advantage in the overall landscape. (Plus, there's also the concern that I myself am in danger of facing relegation, and quick! gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]) In any case, I don't want that to discourage new players from joining in the fun.

So, an added comprehensive Honorable Mentions listing...

Would you enjoy something like that?

 Yes, that would be great.  So, for example, I am assuming I scored four points from the tourney that ended last night having attained a 7th place.  Overall am I say, 20th or 13th, or where?  ( I am not asking you to tell me neccessarily, just hypothetically.  )  But it would be good to know at some point.  Or start a different thread that only lists the overall scores through the first 3 tourneys, then update after each new tourney.  But, I know that's a lot of work too.

Okay, here's my plan...

At the end of this week/month/year (all the same thing) I'll begin including an Honorable Mentions list here on the Top Ten Hall of Fame main post right after the Top Ten listing. Thus, we will have a truly comprehensive listing on display with prime honors, of course, going to the Top Ten and the Honorable Mentions reflecting the remaining overall standings.

2012.

It's going to be real. cool.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/cool.gif]

HAPPY NEW YEAR!!! And welcome to 2012!!!

With Solo Player Tournament #4 and 2 Player Tournament #1 coming to a close at the end of this week/month/year, we see massive activity in the Top Ten Hall of Fame.

Also, right now marks the beginning of the complete and comprehensive listing of all compiled Top Ten rankings as you can see the Honorable Mentions listed above.

Special congrats to muemakan for claiming top of the table and to Fatty for making his first appearance in the Top Ten Hall of Fame. aplauso.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/aplauso.gif]

Can anyone stop muemakan from holding his double digit lead at the top of the table? sorpresa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sorpresa.gif]

Will juicebox start referring to himself more and more in the third person? partido_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/partido_risa.gif]
