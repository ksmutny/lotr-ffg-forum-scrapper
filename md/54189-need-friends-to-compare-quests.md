I started logging my games in notepad a few days ago, but now I find out that there's... this? Neat! Was easy to carry them over. Add me too, I only logged solo games so far though.

## 21 [Maniacske on October 7, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54189-need-friends-to-compare-quests/?do=findComment&comment=538396)

By all means, add me. Have been uploading scores, but not much session reports or tips yet.

## 22 [ClydeCloggie on October 7, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54189-need-friends-to-compare-quests/?do=findComment&comment=538470)

Happy to be added. Play almost exclusively solo and have been using the quest Log since it came on-line to log all wins and 'significant losses' (e.g., first tries of new scenarios or new heroes, losses during campaign games).

It's actually a really nice way of keeping track of how you're doing and what heroes/spheres you've been using.

## 23 [EvilEdwin on October 8, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54189-need-friends-to-compare-quests/?do=findComment&comment=538776)

Add me as well. I've got a bunch of two player games logged.

## 24 [kacek on October 9, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54189-need-friends-to-compare-quests/?do=findComment&comment=539409)

Hi everyone

It's my first post here so I'm a bit self-consciousgui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif] Could you explain to me how this quest log works and what I should do to be able to input my data to it?

Thanks

Kacper

 The Quest Log is a place to enter in the scores of the games you have played.  It keeps count of which heroes you've successfully quested with, your best score on each quest, and what your average score is for each # of players.  If you have a forums account, all you have to do is go to the "More..." tab at the top of the window, and select "Lord of the Rings Quest Log" in the scroll-down menu.  Then click on the picture and you're in.  I would suggest reading the quest log tutorial found at the bottom of the Log's home page to get a better idea of what the Quest Log can and can't do.

I would also like to be added as a friend.

I've got another question concerning the log. The points mean that the fewer I've got the better?

Cheers

The final score is a way to compare the "success" of one deck compared to another, but if you read in some other threads it is in no way a perfect measure. I would encourage you to just focus on completing the quest and not worrying about the final score so much.

## 29 [kacek on October 10, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54189-need-friends-to-compare-quests/?do=findComment&comment=539985)

I logged in my first few quests, but I'm concerned that although I can input my losses they are not seen in the overall statistics or summary.

I was hoping it was possible as sometimes we can learn more from our failures than successes.

Is there any way to make them included in the record?

And when we input 2-player games we can only mention one deck which, again, after some time will not tell us much about the reasons of our success. 

I think I misunderstand the name 'log'. It just seems to be a place to compare average results and not gather data for coming back to later to see what happened during our plays. Am I right?

By no means is my intention to criticize the device as it's a really great way to check where we stand compared to other players.

Those are some of the weakness of the Quest Log.  I usually input a sentence or two about who I played with and what they were using in the notes section, so I could at least see what heroes were in play at the time.  If there was anything that stood out during the game I also put that in the notes section.  It's not as extensive as it could be, but it's still better than nothing.

This is exactly why I would like to put together an "Unofficial Quest Log" using a new scoring system that we can agree on. In addition to letting players track their scores I would like to add as many stat comparisons as possible. Things such as how much threat each player had, the heroes of all players (and maybe even full deck lists), and pretty much any other stat you could imagine.

## 32 [Puzzle2 on October 10, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54189-need-friends-to-compare-quests/?do=findComment&comment=540046)

 I hope that FFG looks at adding some new mechanics to the Quest Log after the busy Q3 season. Like you I would like to see some more stat comparisons, including information on failures. I know that I log both success and failure, but right now the log only provides feedback on the success. I would love be able to see at the very least my win percentage for each quest, but instead I have to manually count.

## 34 [Vase on December 4, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54189-need-friends-to-compare-quests/?do=findComment&comment=563659)

 I'm gonna add some people.  Anyone who wants to add me is welcome to.  I don't play a ton right now, but I might get in a bunch of gaming over Christmas break (grad school is killing me right now).
