# [Mono-Sphere events from Druadan Forest - useless?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87413-mono-sphere-events-from-druadan-forest-useless/)

I'm not sure if there was another thread about this topic or if anyone noticed it yet:

The monosphere-events from druadan forest are partially useless while playing the hobbit saga quests because of bilbo. for multiplayer they would work sometimes but as soloplayer, you are completly unable to play them. I think we will see the same problem in the upcoming sagas since there will be the "ring-sphere". Does anyone think we will see anytime an errata or something for those cards to make them more playable? We will have at least 24 quests where they wouldn't work and imo that's a bit too much.

 

What's your opinion?

Huh, I had never thought about that. My guess is that Caleb will clarify that "token heroes" do not count when playing these cards.

If there hasn't already been, I'd think there will be a clarification to this...and if there's officially not....just play it how u think it should be anyway, or at least that's what I'll do

yes, i thought about this the other day, but considered the designers to mean extra heroes do not count (as they are said not to count towards the hero count)

thanks for pointing it out though as i had forgotten about it, and im interested to see if it was a mistake or not

technically, it doesn't say that the hero isn't a part of the hero count (you still control 4) it's that it does not count against a player's threat or player's starting hero limit.  "it is possible for the first player to begin the game with up to 4 heroes under his control if one of those heroes is [baggins Sphere] Bilbo Baggins." - from the Hobbit rules insert.

Well, they could change it to something like "Play only if you control 3 Leadership heroes." (Changing the sphere as per card, of course) The only problem with that is if you only were playing with 1 or 2 heroes. Though I always play with 3, so something like that would work for me.

However they clear it, I am sure they will so that the events are play-able with Bilbo or Frodo on Saga quests.

I think they will do just that, but I still don't like the mono-deck cards because there benefit isn't that great or not great at all AND they cost 2 which is too much!
