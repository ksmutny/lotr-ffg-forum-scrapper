 What person would you like to see from Lord of the Rings put into the game as a hero?  I always wanted Haldir to come in as a Lore hero but I guess they saw him more as an Ally.  I did think he would go in Lore though so I guess i was right there.  But what are everyone elses thoughts on which characters they want to see as heroes in the up coming adventure packs?

1. Galadriel

2. Elrond

3. Thorin Oakenshield

 * Bard or one of his line
 * Dain Ironfoot
 * Balin
 * Need a 3rd Elf for a Elf deck...maybe Arwen or one of her brothers, Elladan and Elrohir

I'd love to see Thorin too, but unless they change the timeline for the setting of the game, he's dead along with his "'sister - sons" Fili and KIli at the Battle of the Five Armies.

I was most looking forward to seeing Boromir. And he is previewed as coming in Dead Marshes. Then there is pretty much all the characters from the time perioed (or near by) which I would like to see. The only difference is to which I'd like to see as heroes and which as allies, so if I can take the liberty to broaden the thread a bit, I would go like this:

Tom Bombadil - ally

Saruman - ally

Blue Wizards - allies

Galdriel - ally

Elrond - ally

Celeborn - hero

Gildor Inglorion - ally

Elladan - hero

Elrohir - hero

Arwen - ally

Thranduil - hero

Bard - hero

Halbarad - hero

Thengel - ally

Théoden - hero

Éomer - hero

Gamling - ally

Háma - ally

Beregond - ally

Mablung - ally

Dáin Ironfoot - hero

Samwise Gamgee - ally

Meriadock Brandybuck - ally

Peregrin Took - ally

Fredegar Bolger - ally

All that I can think of now. There is surely more...

Elladan & Elrohir.

Thorin if possible, and Bard.

Travel: Ready all characters in play, discard all resource tokens from all pools.

(good night's sleep, but money spent on drinks partido_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/partido_risa.gif] )

Maybe make it a forced travel like East Bight.

Nice.

But how about, Travel: Each hero may spend a resource token to ready.

At this point, can you make Gandalf as a hero?  Especially for coopeartive play, including a Gandalf hero would require all of the other players to make a big change to their player deck

 I'd like to see bunches for lots of different options. In particular, I'd like to see each "faction" (Dwarf, Gondor, Rohan, etc) get some representation in most (if not all) of the Spheres. At least ones where there are corresponding allies/Attachments.

For instance, I'd really like to see a Dwarf Lore hero to go with the Dwarf Lore Allies. I think Balin would be good.

Eomer as a Tactics Hero for Rohan.

And so on.

Don't think I could have said it any better mysefl.  Blue Wizards, Radagast, Saruman, and Gandalf  in a wizard deck would be really fun.  Also a hobbit theme fighting the spiders through mirkwood would be awesome.

How about some Ents? Treebeard and friends. And lol at Saruman as an ally. What would his ability be? As long as Saruman is in play, double any threat increases any player receives and at the end of the round, discard one token from the current quest and all locations?

## 13 [lleimmoen on August 28, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52265-what-hero-would-you-like-to-see/?do=findComment&comment=521025)

I see it may be hard to come up with something sensible for Saruman but he was still in the White Council around this time and was only getting into corruption slowly I think. It is surely interesting from the designer point of view, finding a good compromis between powerful and tricky. I think they have nailed it with Boromir (if he stays as previewed, which I much hope), for Saruman it would have to be different because his character was far from Boromir's but I'm sure it could be gotten past it.

Ents would be fun!  An ent deck escaping from Dol Guldur would be really funny.  I don't think Treebeard could carry the torch though....

And Ents, yes please! As Lore Creature Allies perhaps, so Radagast would be getting another sphere to cooperate with. Then you just need a card to get him in play early.

I'm sure one of the eagles could carry a bucket of water to douse him with in case of emergency. Cooperation and teamwork at it's finest...........................

Yeah Im sure they wouldn't notice a bunch of giant eagles and a huge tree trying to quietly fit through the dungeon halls.  That is a funny image.  But you are right it is very good teamwork which is what this game is all about so why not!
