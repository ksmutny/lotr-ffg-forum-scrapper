Hi!

I did not understood the Response on Aragorn tactics: "Response: After Aragorn participates in an attack that destroys an enemy, choose an enemy not engaged with you and engage that enemy."

So..when choosing an enemy to engage, it means that the enemy attacks first and after it can be attacked?

It depends on when the enemy engages.

Scenario A: Enemy A is engaged, enemy B is still in staging.  Enemy A attacks, enemy B does not.  TaAragorn attacks enemy A, destroys it, and uses his response to pull enemy B out of staging.  Now TaAragorn's buddies can kill it, and it never has a chance to attack.

Scenario B: Enemy A is engaged with TaAragorn's player, Enemy B is engaged with a different player.  During the combat phase, A attacks his player and B attacks the other player.  TaAragorn attacks enemy A, destroys it, and uses his response to pull enemy B from the other player, so his buddies can kill it.  Player B already had a chance to attack.

Scenario C : Enemy A is engaged, enemy B is still in staging.  Before enemy A can attack, Quick Strike is used on Aragorn and he destroys it, then uses his response to pull enemy B out of staging.  Now enemy B is engaged and will make a regular attack, but since shadows were handed out before he was engaged, he won't get one.

Sneaky!
