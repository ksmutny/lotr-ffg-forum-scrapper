Sorry for such a dumb question, but I have (so called) read the rule book twice and cannot see that there is a limit to the number of cards you can have in your hand.

 

Is there?

No.

That's why drawing cards is a bit too powerfull in this game.

Even when I include card-draw in my decks, I often find I need to do something else with those characters, defend, quest etc.. so even with card draw the situation in the scenario often limits it for me (could be I am just a poor player).

Its quite nice not to have to discard cards just because the rules have a max.
