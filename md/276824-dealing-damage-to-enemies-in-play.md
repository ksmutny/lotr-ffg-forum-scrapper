Double checking I've done this right, as it was integral to defeating Journey Along the Anduin this morning. The Core Set Gandalf has the following printed text;

> Quote
> 
> Response:Â After Gandalf enters play, (choose 1): draw 3 cards, deal 4 damage to 1 enemy in play, or reduce your threat by 5.

Am I right in thinking that a) 'enemy in play' would include enemies in the Staging Area, and that b) when card text instructs you to deal damage to an enemy, you ignore that enemy's defence?

Think I'd still have been able to fight my way past the Hill Troll if either of those things aren't the case, but they made it so much easier that I thought I'd better double check...!

Hi - yes, you are right on both counts. Direct damage can go on any eligible target (in Gandalf's case, that includes enemies in the staging area or engaged with other playes, unless the enemy has immunity), and ignores defence.

Direct damage is a very useful strategy in many quests!

Weyhey! Cheers, Boromore - nice to know I'd done it right (no wonder Gandalf if so useful in a deck!)
