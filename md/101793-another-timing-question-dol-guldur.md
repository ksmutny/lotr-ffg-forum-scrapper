Staging the objectives and drawing shadow card. I believe that there are no resources tokens as yet since it is still the setup phase - to bad because I have "A Test of Will" in my initial draw -

 

First encounter card revealed - Ungoliant's  Spawn, everyone's favorite little lady. 

 

Question. When Revealed: Each character currently committed to a quest get -1 questing until the end of the phase.

 

I'm not questing yet, am I.  I'm revealing the first three encounter cards. But then comes the resource phase. 

 

Right?

 

Thanx in advance.

Pretty sure it´s in the FAQ somewhere, but can´t pinpoint it right now.

 

When you reveal a card during setup with an effect that lasts "until the end of the phase" then it lasts until the end of the first resource phase. In the case of Ungoliant´s Spawn meaning that it will have no real effect.

Thanx much. All you pros are a great help to the rest of folks.
