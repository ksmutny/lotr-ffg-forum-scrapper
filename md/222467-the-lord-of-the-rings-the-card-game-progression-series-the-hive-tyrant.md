Hello, viewers! My name is Mitch, and alongside co-host Matthew Dempsey, I'm pleased to announce the beginning of the new The Lord of the Rings: the Card Game Progression Series [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmkDVibqfjU65cexxMcQDhPC52XKgWWVp]!
 

In this series of videos, Matthew and I intend to re-experience our favorite Living Card Game from its very beginning. Together, we will discuss and subsequently play through all available, official products and expansions for The Lord of the Rings: the Card Game sequentially, restricting ourselves to building decks using only player cards which were available to us at the time of each individual product’s original retail release. However, though Matthew and I will use only a limited card pool, we shall regardless adhere to all errata and rulings contained within the most up to date version of the official FAQ, hopefully making this series informative and entertaining to those players both new to the game and veteran alike.

All new videos in this series will be posted below!

Excellent video. If I had been Matthew I would have addressed the powerful Gloin decks that have popped out recently, but nonetheless it's utterly fantastic to have this series back and this first evaluation series was a great installment.

Believe me, I'm absolutely thrilled to be back myself! I can scarcely believed I stayed away for so long, but now that I'm returned, it feels very, very good to be home. Thanks for watching!

I'm very glad you enjoyed it! In his "defense," he was strongly discouraged from mentioning anything too specific about modern-day cards and deck-building ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] but I don't think that mentioning that would have been a bad idea at all. All the same, plenty of time to mention it in the future! After all, I think it may take at least a few videos to cover the past five years of LOTR LCG! So much to talk about. So excited to be back!

After a great many unfortunate obstacles and delays, the second episode of The Lord of the Rings: the Card Game Progression Series is finally live! Today, Mitch and Matthew assess and evaluate the Tactics hero and player cards of the CORE set. Do engage with us by sharing your own personal thoughts, opinions, and memories of these cards in the comments, and enjoy our celebration of and throwback to the very beginnings of #LOTRLCG!

That's fantastic. I cannot recommend enough that you pick it up again! I'm going to need some company along this long, tireless journey of mine, and LOTR LCG seems just as enthralling as ever it was when I tragically left it behind. So, best wishes to you! And should you decide to return yourself, here's hoping you enjoy your continued adventures in Middle-earth.

Mitch, just wanted to let you know Im so glad you've come back.  I started to play the game around when you left and your videos were honestly what inspired me to love this game as much as I do.  I will be closely following your videos closely and once more cannot express in words how glad I am that you're coming back to play lotr lcg!  You're the best!

Oh gosh, I totally missed this comment! Thank you so much for your extraordinarily kind words, and I'm honestly overjoyed to have finally returned to the community. I'm flattered you liked the original Progression Series so much, but look forward to many, many more shared journeys in Middle-earth together in the future! Thanks tons for watching, and being a part of this experience. It's comments like this that make the whole endeavor so rewarding!

It's nice to see the Progression series back (I think the PTM one was the first LOTR LCG video I spotted on Youtube).

Today, Matthew and I conclude our player card evaluation of the Lord of the Rings: the Card Game CORE set! On the agenda for this video is Lore, and as always, be sure to share your own thoughts, opinion, perspective, and experience with any or all of these cards in the comments! Plus, with our CORE set now covered, you can look forward to our first several scenario play-throughs to come soon.




 




Note: I must sincerely apologize for the reduced audio quality of this video. Matthew's recording unintentionally contained a significant amount of crackling and popping, and my efforts at noise removal and reduction have significantly affected his vocal fidelity. Hopefully this is just a one-time issue, and that you still find some redeeming value herein.




 




Also, if you've yet to check out The Hive Tyrant on iTunes or SoundCloud, these Progression Series episodes are also available in audio-only format! So, I appreciate your understanding, and hope you enjoy. Take care!

After far too many weeks of waiting, I present the latest installment of the Lord of the Rings: the Card Game Progression Series! Today, Matthew and I tackle the first quest of the CORE set - Passage Through Mirkwood - and things could scarcely go any more unexpectedly. So, here's hoping you enjoy the first scenario playthrough episode of our series, and look forward to more entries in this ongoing project in the future!




 




Note: scheduling between he and I has been much more difficult than anticipated, but rest assured that this series shall remain a permanent project. Take care, and do leave your thoughts and feedback in the comments!

Another episode of the Lord of the Rings: the Card Game Progression Series is live! Today, Matthew and I continue onward from Mirkwood in exploring the trio of scenarios from the CORE set. This time, we tackle Journey Along the Anduin! Will our first encounter with a Hill Troll end in victory, or catastrophe?




 




Be sure to tune in, find out, and enjoy! I'd forgotten both how much fun *and* how much effort entries in this series are to produce, though I hope you're entertained by this new video. Matthew and I certainly had a blast while recording it! So take care, and look forward to many more future episodes to come.

I usually don't mind it and it is such a remarkable Thing for the Progression series, it wouldn't feel right for me, if left out. It are only these rare Moments when 3 sneak attack Gandalfs and a regular played one, 4 phases back to back, that it gets a Little much^^

In fairness, if I wouldn't have restarted the series from the beginning, I wouldn't have bothered doing a new series at all - so presuming that everyone enjoys these new videos, hopefully a bit of a nostalgia experience is better than nothing. But yeah, I totally understand it's less than ideal seeing a bunch of dated content.

The Gandalf clip is such a divisive thing. It's fascinating to read comments in which it's either lovingly - or scathingly - received, in these new videos.

I think that the most times it has ever appeared in one video (in the original series) was five, and yes, I agree that the gag can wear thin quickly. I'll try to show control and restraint when it comes to using the thing, as opposed to running it into the ground.

It has been fun to listen to. Nice work.

 

I am very interested in what you think of the later cards but I suppose we got a while to go before that. 

## 28 [TheHiveTyrant on August 30, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/222467-the-lord-of-the-rings-the-card-game-progression-series-the-hive-tyrant/?do=findComment&comment=2391800)

The community had long clamored for the return of the regrettably discontinued LOTR LCG Progression Series, so who was I to continue to deny them?

 

Today, Matthew and I *attempt* to conclude our coverage of the CORE set in one last video, by daring to venture into the dark, ominous tower of The Necromancer. With one of our brethren having been lead astray in Mirkwood and then abducted through foul magics, have we any hope to break into and subsequently Escape from Dol Guldur? Or, shall our fellowship fail, and will we join our lost comrade in being trapped, forever rotting in forgotten  dungeons?

 

Be sure to tune in, find out, and enjoy, and look forward to many more Progression Series episodes to come soon! I could scarcely be more pleased in having finally returned to the community, and could be no less excited about my bright future of producing many more LOTR LCG videos. Until next time, take care!

Ready far earlier than expected, I present another installment of the LOTR LCG Evaluation Series! Before testing our mettle against The Hunt for Gollum scenario, Matthew and I first seek to review and assess our very first Adventure Pack's new hero and player cards. Do share with us your own thoughts and experiences past and present in the comments, and enjoy!

 

As an aside - Matthew and I may not be able to release episodes in this series as often as we would like, but this new project has quickly become an absolute labor of love for he and I. We thank you for joining us on our new journey together, and hope you continue to enjoy our ongoing Progression Series for months and years to come!

Interesting series, watched the Anduin mission. I am assuming you guys are doing everything right, which means I was doing a few things wrong. I didn't think you could wait to discard cards for Eowyn's ability, that makes it SO much more powerful. Also some interesting combinations that I want to try out, great resource for a new player.

 

One thing I noticed though is that poor Mathew seems like he is getting QBed pretty hard by the other guy.. I know it's hard not to, especially when you want to talk for our benefit.. I find myself doing this to my own friend as well. Anyone have tips on how NOT to do that? Lol

Again really loving the card evaluation videos, it is great to see what your opinions are of cards.

 

Your comment about a new Bilbo... He really does deserve a new hero card that is costed appropriately.

> Interesting series, watched the Anduin mission. I am assuming you guys are doing everything right, which means I was doing a few things wrong. I didn't think you could wait to discard cards for Eowyn's ability, that makes it SO much more powerful. Also some interesting combinations that I want to try out, great resource for a new player.

You could adhere to the table talk rule in the rulebook pretty strictly. I sometimes find myself QB or alpha-gaming with my partner, instead of letting her figure out the best course of action on her own, because I'm more experienced at ccgs and such.

 

We've relaxed the table talk rule a lot, but at first we played with no talk allowed about what was in our hand, or what we could/planned to do. But, honestly, that's not quite as fun imo. I just have to remind myself to keep quiet when she's deciding stuff, unless she specifically asks me. I usually reply with "do what you think is the better option!" haha

I find the best way to do this is to wait for them to come to a decision then put in your 2 cents worth.

Today, Matthew and I take on the first scenario of the Shadows of Mirkwood cycle! In an attempt to track down the whereabouts of the wretched and vilesome Gollum, we must first discover his trail – however, cunning hunters from Mordor will do their utmost to hinder and ruin us. Shall we succeed, and begin our pursuit of the villain in earnest? Or, shall our Fellowship be scattered and utterly broken? Be sure to tune in to find out, and please share with us your own experiences with The Hunt for Gollum in the comments!

Well I don't know why, maybe because at the moment I only own 1 copy, but i didn't think about playing 2 Unexpected Courage on the same character.

Now just imagine that with Beravor before her errata. Three (or more!) copies of Unexpected Courage on her was absolutely ridiculous.

Finally had time to watch the "Hunt for Gollum"-game. I think it perfectly showcases the entertaining parts as well as the annoying flaws the quests has in it's non-nightmare form (in NM many of the "delay-victory" cards are taken out iirc).

It looks like Matthew and I had the poor fortune of revealing the worst encounter card of all, this afternoon! Technical difficulties :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

 

While I investigate this problem (and everyone's favorite host of the Progression Series looks into purchasing a new PC), I humbly request your patience and understanding if it takes a fair while longer than expected to successfully record our next LOTR LCG episode. Sorry, everybody! I can't wait for the day that this series finally falls into a regular schedule of production.

 

Rest assured, though, that neither he nor I are going anywhere! We shall see this series through, regardless of how long it may take us.

I just wanted to update everyone that the Progression Series has finally returned!

After a month-long hiatus because of broken computers and scheduling conflicts, Matthew and I just finished recording a 90-minute long video. Look forward to watching us play through Conflict at the Carrock soon, because it just might be our most entertaining video yet! From here on out, hopefully you can expect much, much more regular content. Thanks to everyone for your patience and understanding!

Having at last overcome our technical terrors, the Progression Series is finally back! Today, I welcome you to join Matthew and I as we attempt to answer the plight of Grimbeorn the Old.

 

Shall we succeed in expunging four vile and loathsome Trolls from the realm of the Beornings, or instead, shall we find ourselves minced, boiled, or just sat upon and squashed into jelly?

 

This is without a doubt the most fun Matthew and I have ever had while recording a video, so I do hope you tune in to find out. So, follow the link, take care, and enjoy the latest bit of nostalgia that the Progression Series has to offer!

 

Please share your own "Conflict at the Carrock" experiences in the YouTube comments, and I thank everyone again for their patience. Take care!

Spoiler warning!

 

I am glad you could fix your technical difficulties and hyped for the upcoming Content! The fun you had really Transfers to the viewer and so many "unusual" Things Happening during this match makes this one my personal favourite so far. Unexpected and unheard of hero deaths seem to be the Thing for the new Progression series and even though it's always sad and I can't say it wasn't entertaining :rolleyes: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_rolleyes.gif]

 

 

It is still a Long way until this becomes relevant for the series, but do you already have plans for the LotR-Sagas in regards to playing campaign mode or not?

I'm very glad to hear that you enjoyed the latest installment so much! And I must say, for as anxious and worried as I get leading right up to recordings, I was delighted that the quest ended up going so well and that Matthew and I both had a spectacular time in the process. At the moment, Matthew and I have no plans to cover the Saga expansions in Campaign mode, but I could certainly see it happening eventually. At the moment, our plans are to cover all "normal difficulty" content in the order of its chronological release, with the exception being print on demand scenarios (like The Massing at Osgiliath), which will be inserted into the series when appropriate. Then, when Matthew and I someday exhaust all normal difficulty content, we'll kill time waiting for new expansions by releasing full card pool nightmare mode videos. If we catch up on everything, or just get bored, I could certainly envision tackling Campaign mode - and regardless, thanks for bringing it to my attention! Matthew and I had a bit of a chat about it this evening, and are still open to changing our tentative plans.

To help make up for the prolonged Progression Series absence, I'm pleased to already offer up another new video! Today, regale yourself with Matthew and I musing on the player cards from A Journey to Rhosgobel. As always, you're strongly encouraged to share your personal sentiments in the YouTube comments!




 




Which of these new deck-building options in our series are hits, and which do you consider misses? Which were superb in their day, and are any still useful at present? Do you agree with my appraisal and Matthew's, or could we scarcely be any less correct in severely undervaluing some of these cards?




 




I hope your enjoy hearing our thoughts - we look forward to yours - and until next episode, when we tackle the titular scenario, I wish you all well!

Though the year is approaching its close, the Progression Series is thriving!




 




Today, Matthew and I take pause during our ongoing search for the loathsome and abominable Gollum - and between each chapter of our perilous journey, it seems that we always encounter new allies. So, before we confront the imminently upcoming new challenge presented by our over-arching quest, please join us for our evaluation of the new player cards of The Hills of Emyn Muil!




 




Do you agree with my sentiments and Matthew's on each of these options, or do you find us to be unfairly kind or critical? What are your personal experiences with our new hero and player cards, and what are your own favorite combos therewith?




 




Do share your own opinions and perspective in the comments, and I hope you enjoy this new video. Take care, everybody, and I very much look forward to hearing from you!

Thanks for the great series - Today, a friend and I just started our own little OCTGN progression series (just epically failed Journey along the Anduin after drawing two hill trolls right at the beginning and holding off a storm of enemies, just to be, after finally embarking on the raft, finished off by a nasty suite of treacheries - very fun :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] - we failed to bring any healing effects which turned out to be a bad choice ).

 

I have been thinking about what to do with scenarios that were released in-between cycles. In particular 1) when to play promotional scenarios, 2) when to add in cards from the Saga expansion, and 3) when to play Saga expansions.

 

It looks like you are skipping the promotional scenarios for now (As far as I know Massing at Osgiliath was released before the Hills of Emyn Muil). I guess in your old progression series you played that scenario after the entire Shadows of Mirkwood cycle. Reasonable - I can imagine it to be extremely luck dependent with a card pool just up to Rhosgobel (without Boromir etc.). I found it to be a (all be it fun) challenge even with cards up to Khazad Dum...

 

As for the Saga expansions, it could be a little odd to play the Hobbit 1, then Heirs of Numenor, then the Hobbit 2; or to play the Black Riders in the middle of the Against the Shadows cycle, then wait until the Road darkens was released in the middle of the Ringmaker etc. Especially if one wants to enjoy campaign mode. However, I guess one could expand the card pool at the correct times and continue playing the regular cycles?

 

In any case, for anyone who has been there, I was just wondering what your solutions and thoughts were on handling this issue .

Happy questing and thanks!

Hey there, Aaron!

Thank you very much for reaching out and expressing your appreciation for the series. I'll be sure to share your post with Matthew, as he and I both always love hearing from viewers ^_^ [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_happy.png]

What I intend to do for this series is to play through everything in "mostly" chronological order. You're quite right that The Massing at Osgiliath came out very early indeed - in fact, it was first available at Gen Con alongside Conflict at the Carrock! That's a lot of scenario for not a large pool of player cards, and for this ongoing Progression Series, Matthew and I intend to play PoD stuff inbetween cycles. One notable exception to this rule was back in the original Progression Series, when Matthew and I played The Battle of Lake-Town between the second and third scenario of The Hobbit: On the Doorstep saga expansion; it just seemed natural (and narrative-appropriate), to do so. On this channel, I intend to "take a break" from the Progression Series when, chronologically, a Saga Expansion was released.

For instance, we will do the following in order:

Shadow and Flame - Progression Series Episode X

The Hobbit: Over Hill and Under Hill - (one evaluation series episode, 3+ saga series episodes)

Heirs of Numenor - (one evaluation series episode, 3+ progression series episodes)

The Hobbit: On the Doorstep - (one evaluation series episode, 3+ saga series episodes)

Steward's Fear - Progression Series Episode Y

As a box or adventure pack is opened, we'll be adding those cards to our card pool moving forward. So, I hope that explains quite clearly what he and I intend to do, but you're certainly welcome to do whatever you'd like. For more detail about the ongoing Progression Series, check out the now slightly outdated project summary [http://tinyurl.com/LOTRLCGProgressionSeries/].

Here's hoping that you have a bit better luck, moving forward! For what it's worth, I don't think I've ever faced two first-turn Hill Trolls, when playing Journey Along the Anduin ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] 

So again, thanks for reaching out, and best wishes to you!

That strategy sounds reasonable. The only thing one will have to remember is the progress in the campaign with the Boons and Burdens. I am still curious to try Massing at Osgiliath with the limited cardpool - It is probably a "puzzle" (as you might say) that is not consistently solvable but could be a fun experience for all the masochists among us.

The path of their elusive quarry has lead our heroes to the momentary reprieve of a green and verdant clearing, where they find themselves surrounded on all sides by stone ridges, brambles, and many tall pillars of unyielding rock. In the midst of this unforgiving, but solemnly beautiful landscape, they see in the far distance the great Anduin cascading over Rauros to the South, while to the East and West stand the twin, formidable peaks of Amon Lhaw and Amon Hen.




 




While the tell-tale signs of nearby Orcs abound, and begin to increase in frequency, the path of the creature Gollum has grown all but entirely cold; our heroes are now faced with the task of scouring the Emyn Muil in attempt to rediscover its trajectory and whereabouts, lest they never manage to find their game. Closer than lends comfort, the bark and eerie howl of slathering Wargs suddenly echoes off of stone...




 




After a long week of waiting, I am honored to present another installment of The Lord of the Rings: the Card Game Progression Series! Today, Matthew and I tackle The Hills of Emyn Muil.




 




Please feel encouraged to share your own memories and play experiences in the YouTube comments, and I dearly hope you enjoy another video. I can make no promises, alas, but Matthew and I are going to *attempt* to increase the frequency with which we produce and deliver episodes of this series. So until next time, take care, and look forward to more harrowing LOTR LCG content to come soon! Thanks for watching.

The Progression Series continues! Today, while still fresh from our recent investigations of the Emyn Muil, Matthew and I crack open The Dead Marshes adventure pack. Inside, we find one of the strongest heroes ever to be produced for LOTR LCG, as well as a whole host of cards that we really enjoyed talking about.

The Progression Series continues!




 




After months of tireless searching, Matthew and I have finally discovered the whereabouts of the wicked and loathsome Gollum. As we wade into the murky, misty swamplands to secure our capture of the creature, will dark knowledge of the long-forgotten, waterlogged ancient battlefield allow Gollum to, at the last moment, elude us?




 




Will our quarry be snatched and bound, or instead, shall our Fellowship be gobbled up by vast, serpentine worms, or even mesmerized into drowning by the lights and spirits of the long dead?




 




Please share your own play experiences and strategies with The Dead Marshes in the comments, and I hope you enjoy today's video!




 




As always, we may not be able to produce these episodes half so often as we would like, but we appreciate your patience and are grateful for your support of our series. Take care!

Really looking forward to when you guys break into the next cycle. While I have enjoyed the Evaluation Series so far, I haven't been able to watch the Progression Series just because I've done those missions so many times I'm a bit sic of 'em :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

 

Also, I think the Dwarrowdelf Cycle does a pretty good job at opening up some different deck options. Seeing the same cards over and over again is a bit tedious to watch. Not your guys' fault, there's just only so many viable decks you can make with the tiny card pool you currently have access to.

 

I do appreciate that you guys seem to try and use each new hero at least once instead of just using the same six power house heroes. I'm especially looking forward to your opinions on Elladan and Elrohir, they were quite a polarizing pair in the group I used to play with.

With the hissing, indignant, and hate-filled Gollum having at last been captured and bound in the swampy morass of the Dead Marshes, our intrepid heroes have but one final task to finish prior to completing their quest - they must Return to Mirkwood!




 




Will Mitch and Matthew be able to safely guard and transport the irate, wailing troglodyte to the halls of the elven king, so that he might see interrogation? Or instead, will the anguished, enraged cries and howls of the bound creature beckon forth more chattering, skittering dangers from the dark and treacherous trees of the surrounding forest than our heroes are able to contend with?




 




Be sure not to miss this ensorcelling conclusion to the Progression Series' adventures in the Shadows of Mirkwood cycle, and please share your own experiences with this scenario in the comments!




 




As always, take care, and thanks for watching.

Well done once again M&M and thanks a lot for doing this! It's always a pleasure to watch and listen to you two. As much as I'd like you to catch up with where you left of a few years ago, do take all the time you need. It's really nice to revisit these old quests again and occasionally I find cards I had forgotten even existed. Here's wishing you a great 2017!

As the Progression Series prepares to cover the upcoming Khazad-dûm deluxe expansion and its associated Dwarrowdelf cycle, please join Matthew and I as we put a bow on our Shadows of Mirkwood coverage!




 




Today, we talk all about themes and trends, and share our overall opinions of each of the products that we've reviewed and played thus far. We discuss the state of Heroes and player cards in the CORE Set, as well as how they evolved over the course of our first full expansion block. Matthew and I share our personal sentiments and experiences playing through each of our first nine scenarios, and I would adore the opportunity to read some of your own opinions on any or all of these topics in the comments!




 




So, please enjoy over two hours of podcast-style listening, let Matthew and I know if you agree or disagree with our thoughts on what we've seen in LOTR LCG thus far, and here's hoping that you enjoy the rest of your weekend. Take care, community, and fare well!

With the Shadows of Mirkwood cycle now well behind us, this next adventure sees Matthew and I as part of a scouting party from Gondor which has ventured deep within the ruins of Osgiliath. Finding ourselves suddenly waylaid by the vanguard forces of a huge host in service of the Enemy, have we any hope of escape, so as to warn the vulnerable citizens of the White City? Shall the Progression Series co-hosts again reign triumphant, or shall we instead find ourselves slain by a foe no man may fell? After far too many weeks of absence, be sure to check out the latest installment of the series, enjoy, and look forward to more to come soon!

Balin has been lost, and the ancient Dwarf kingdom of Khazad-dûm has been confirmed to be overflowing with the ever-multiplying rank and file of the Enemy.
 
As the heroes of the Progression Series prepare for the next mission of their unending journey, they find themselves hunted by a creature more old and unyielding than the very mines they explore; at once, our adventurers are engulfed in choking and burning flame, and strangled by blanketing, smothering shadow.
 
Against a foe whose power is rivaled only by its wickedness, cunning, and fury, there is no hope for victory. Today, please join co-hosts Mitch and Matthew of the Progression Series for our play-through of Flight from Moria!
 
While watching, please do us the kindness of sharing your very own best (and worst!) experiences playing through any of the scenarios from LOTR LCG's very first deluxe expansion; each viewer comment is a delightful opportunity for interaction with the community, and I love exchanging fond memories with fellow fans of this gem of a card game.

As an aside, I (Mitch) have officially completed all coursework required to obtain a second Bachelor's degree - this time, in Nutrition and Dietetics. As I make the transition into a new phase of my life (in ongoing pursuit of a career-job or an internship), here's looking forward to my finally having a little free time again, for a change!
 
Thank you to everyone for your ongoing interest in and support of this series, and I hope you enjoy this new episode. Look forward to the PS2 TRG scenario play-through to come soon, as well as a great many more episodes eventually thereafter.
 
Until next time, enjoy the rest of your weekend, and take care!

I sincerely wish that Matthew and I were able to produce new episodes far more frequently, but unfortunately, it just doesn't seem possible at the moment for us to do much more than maintain our currently glacial pace of release.

While neither of us have any intent to abandon this project, Matthew consistently works well over 40 hours per week, is often required to travel for his job, and he has several hobbies outside of LOTR LCG, some of which happen to be rather time-consuming. Plus, he's a member of The Grey Company podcast, has a reasonably active social life, and on occasion even seizes the opportunity to meet up with friends to play cards at his local game store.

Relative to him, I happen to have far more available free time, but I'm also in the process of figuring out how to finally establish a financially stable, independent existence. Years ago, I earned a Master's degree in mental health counseling, but after spending quite some time in the profession, nationwide budget cuts meant a huge number of layoffs, and as a result, that career path essentially closed for me. Now, I'm once again freshly graduated from college, but to my shock and dismay, I was rejected by everywhere that I applied to intern - an endeavor necessary prior to my becoming a career dietitian.

So, at the moment, I'm trying to figure out what to do next with my life, and to be entirely frank, I'm not always feeling in a good enough mood to produce enjoyable videos, even if Matthew happens to have some free time crop up unexpectedly. Add in that I no longer live alone, and thus have to contend with noise pollution courtesy of housemates, their dogs, and even the occasional kid visiting them... I'm sure that you get the picture.

I earnestly hope that in time, he and I are able to pick up our pace of production dramatically - but for the moment, I appreciate your (and everyone else's) patience. Thank you for your support! And for what it's worth, I do hope that you continue to enjoy each new episode in our series. Though our output is low, I do treasure the opportunity to keep making these dorky videos, and hearing that people in this community such as yourself seem to enjoy them so much - it's very flattering. Thank you for encouraging me to continue sharing my passion and enthusiasm for all things LOTR LCG!

While I do appreciate your feedback, shifting focus to exclusively covering modern expansions and nightmare scenarios doesn't quite align with my vision for the Progression Series. Though my approach may not be ideal for everyone, all I can say is that my goal is to eventually cover everything. In the process of doing so, I hope that at least some aspect of these videos will appeal to most LOTR LCG players, but in any case, I'll certainly endeavor to keep this series progressing. Who knows - perhaps there may come a day when Matthew and I do manage to catch up to the latest content that this card game has to offer.

Thanks for your kind response, sir. I was referring, in part, to the fact that the first progression series already contains videos of early quest and card analysis that you could have skipped and picked up where you left. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

The decision not to continue the original series, but rather, to start over, is definitely a controversial one. There are a great many reasons that I decided to do so, but chief among them is that I consider the quality at the beginning of the old series to be rather poor. Many mistakes were made, my thought process was less logical then, and I've since significantly improved as a player. Plus, over the years I have grown woefully out of practice at LOTR LCG, drifted away from the community, and stopped paying attention to the game until relatively recently - in fact, to this day, the modern card pool remains essentially an unknown to me.

Now though, as I perceive myself to be older, wiser, and a more capable player than ever I once was, I've been enjoying re-learning how to play the game, and have been delighted to share my experiences with the community while doing so. I dream of someday being able to chronicle and cover the entire catalogue of this card game's litany of expansions, and am pleased to take any willing to come with me on my journey. While my approach may not be for everyone, I do appreciate the community's patience, and look forward to continuing to work on this series!
