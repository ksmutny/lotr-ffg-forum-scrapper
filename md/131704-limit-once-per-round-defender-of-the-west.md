# [Limit once per round: Defender of the West](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/131704-limit-once-per-round-defender-of-the-west/)

I have a question upon the use of defender of the west:

I understand how this card works but since it moves characters within players I got confused by the limit once per round of some characters. My own thoughts are as follows, but to be sure I'm asking it in here. When Erestor passes to you in the Refresh Phase you can use him, since you didn't do it yet that round. And before he leaves you again the next round you can do it again since you didn't use him yet this new round. These 2 moments don't violate with the limit once per round. But it would make his action twice as strong in a 2 player game, since every player can still renew a card every round. The downside however is that if we add up the numbers we find Erestor gets triggered 2x a round, so therefore my question.

Based on previous rulings, I think it's legit to use it twice per turn in this situation.  But I'm not 100% sure. 

Edit: I was wrong.  Once per round and once per phase are specific to the card.  Once per game is the only exception that applies to each player.

 

An interesting comparison is Rider of the Mark.  That card has limit once per round and has a built-in way to change owners.  Does anyone play that as "limit once per round per player"?  A quick search of the FFG and BGG forums is inconclusive.

I am leaning towards that the ability follows the character in this instance. I have nothing concrete to back it up though.

While I don't remember where the ruling happened, it has been ruled that ability limits other than per game are dependent on the card using them, not the player. So when Erestor transfers for DotW, although the new first player hasn't used his ability that round, that doesn't matter - Erestor has used his ability that round. The only way to circumvent this is to have the card leave play and return, because then it would be considered to be a different Erestor than the one which used the ability the first time.

Limits are global, only "once per game" limits are considered per player.

I guess you would have to play it 'once per round per player' any way you look at it -- otherwise, what is that limit text intended for?

Well, it's once per round... not sure why you would read it like "per player" when it is not written like this... Or I didn't understand your phrase.

The confusion is because "once per game" actually means "once per game per player".  It's unclear if "once per round" also means "once per round per player".  I figured Caleb must have commented about this a while ago, but I can't find a reference anywhere.  I'm going to shoot him an email so we can have an official answer.

And a quick response from Caleb:

 

> The “limit once per game” are the only player-specific restrictions. All other restrictions are card-specific. So the effect on Rider of Mark can only be used once per round, regardless of who triggered it.

When in doubts, I recommend checking this : http://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/92338-unofficial-faq-compilation-of-answer-from-around-the-web/ [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/92338-unofficial-faq-compilation-of-answer-from-around-the-web/]

 

Could be cool if it was up to date :o [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_ohmy.png]

Didn't know that existed.  I wonder if we could make that a sticky in the rules forum.

It's unofficial, most source are mail answer from Caleb and can't really be proven... so... don't think it is possible on this forum

I'm just misunderstanding my own writing... yes, I meant "once per round" not "once per round per player," forgive me!

Thanks for all replies, somewhat strange the "once per round" and "once per game" are so different. But good to know :-)
