Has anyone else noticed that Damrod likes to place all his traps in the same spot in the forest?  Well what if Damrod discovered a new spot for his traps!?

 

Damrod's Discovery: Response: As an enemy is being added to the staging area, exhaust Damrod's Discovery to choose a Trap in the staging area.  Other Traps in the staging area cannot attach to the enemy the first time the enemy enters the staging area this round.

 

Not sure if I worded it all correctly, but I think you understand the intent of the card.  In multiplayer it would help you attach multiple traps in the staging area to different enemies in the same turn.  I suppose in single player it might even help against surges of enemies.

 

It would be nice if you could create a deck on spamming as many traps as possible, but right now, usually playing one per turn is the way to go.

The new Lore ally from City of Corsairs can help with this, by playing him during staging after you play a trap then returning that enemy to get trapped. Then playing a 2nd trap that round.

Lore Mablung helped with that as well, but I do get the desire to play out more than 1 trap at a time and spread them around.  I do like the concept of what you are trying to do, but being able to pick and choose which attachment attaches would be pretty strong.   With the way you have it now, you get to see which enemy came out first, then pick which trap goes on him.   While the traps are pretty strong, that blind attachment is part of their risk.  and it is fitting for the theme since you don't know which enemy is coming next, you don't know which trap would be best suited for that enemy.

 

 

How about something like this:

Name: Expert Trapper

Type: Attachment

Trait: Skill

Cost: 2

Text: Attached to a Ranger or Dunedain hero

Action: Exhaust Expert Trapper to choose a trap in the staging area.  All traps not selected will ignore the first enemy revealed from the encounter deck this phase.  

 

OR: 

 

Name: Expert Trapper

Type: Attachment

Trait: Skill

Cost: 0

Text: Attached to a Ranger or Dunedain hero

Quest Action: Pay X resources from the attached hero's resource pool to choose a Trap in the staging area.  That trap ignores the next X number of enemies revealed from the encounter deck this phase.  At the end of the phase, if the chosen Trap is still in play and unattached, move 1 resource to the attached hero's resource pool.

 

The second option would allow you to "stage" traps for multiple sets of enemies, but it thematically costs more resources to plan that far ahead to trap different enemies.

 

Both options still leave it a gamble of what enemy will get hit which with trap, which I think is important for the mechanic.

I love my trap deck and its pretty strong. Yeah I agree it would be nice to see some traps that were "not all sitting at the same spot" lmao I laughed out loud when I read that

What about an ally

Ithilien Trapper:

Trait:

Gondor Ranger

Sphere: Lore

Cost: 2

1/0/1 2

Reaction: When an enemy is revealed, exhaust Lorien Trapper to prevent one trap from attaching this round to that enemy.

 

You are sacrificing the utility of the trapper to hold back one trap to be able to maybe use it later. More allies = more control. Using them means no help questing or defending, maybe add one more to the cost.

I'd take that ally option also since it ties up the character.  Except I did notice he doesn't actually work as worded.  His name is Ithilien Trapper and his text refers to a Lorien Trapper  ^_^ [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_happy.png]

 

It still has the power to let you pick and choose what attachment will get attached to an enemy, but as a character that can die and is generally harder to keep on the board than an attachmnet, that seems like a fair enough risk for that power.

 

 

While we are dreaming up cards for one of my favorite mechanics, I want an event that basically has you strip resources from the enemies that you have trapped.  Maybe something like:

 

Sphere: Lore

Name: Scavenge and Reuse

Type: Event

Trait: Tactic

Cost: 0

Text: Play only if you control a Ranger or Dunedain hero and there are 2 or more enemies with Trap attachments attached.  Place X resources on a Ranger or Dunedain hero of your choice for every 2 different enemies with Trap attachments attached.

 

And while thinking up that, I also came up with a new mechanic/interaction that would be really cool if implemented:

 

Sphere: Lore

Name: Trapper Man (I leave it up to you guys to come up with a better name...)

Type: Character (unique)

Trait: Ranger, Dunedain

STATS: 2, 1, 2, 3

Cost: 5

Text: Any time a trap attaches to an enemy, the players as a group may spend 1 Tactics resource to put X-1 resources on that trap, where X is that enemy's health.  Anytime a player deals damage to that enemy, they may move one resource from the attached trap to a hero of their choice.

How about an ally who exhausts to move a currently-attached trap to a different enemy?

An ally with a response to unattach a trap card after it is attached, so you can draw a card with Damrod before unattaching. And it is useful while staging

Yeah sorry SlothGodFather, I original named it Lorien Trapper mixing up my LOTR locations (everybody makes mistakes) I then checked my location and changed the name, but did not change the text, oops.

 

 

> How about an ally who exhausts to move a currently-attached trap to a different enemy?

I believe this is too strong an effect and is a little unthematic. The theme of traps is to not know what is coming and hopefully prepare the right trap. If you can just selectively move them, they become pretty OP and then you can do that with Forest Snare. Keep an enemy from attacking, kill it, but move Forest snare to someone else right before you do so that a new enemy can't attack. An infinite chain of disabling enemies. Get three out and you can move 3 traps from an enemy to someone else. Also thematically what are you doing? Helping one orc out of a trap then shoving a different one in?

Agreed the effect would be powerful.  However, make it an exhaust ability and a planning action on a 3+ cost unique ally and I don't see it as any more overpowered than Anborn.

 

Is it "unthematic?"  Theme is in the eye of the beholder, and the very first trap (Forest Snare) does not participate in the place-before-reveal mechanic of other traps.  If you can accept placing a Forest Snare directly on an in-play enemy as "thematic", you should be able to rationalize moving one as the original victim escaping, but the other blundering into the same trap.

 

Personally, I don't think it's terribly thematic for the first enemy to fall into every trap placed for him.  Surely it is just as plausible to lay out poisoned stakes and ranger spikes as *separate* traps than to put every trap you have into one Rube Goldberg contraption that catches the first enemy and only the first enemy.  That traps work the way they do is a results of mechanics, not theme, IMO.  I'd welcome a way to ameliorate it.

> put every trap you have into one Rube Goldberg contraption that catches the first enemy and only the first enemy.  

 

This is my favorite thing to imagine now.  Aragorn setting up a very complicated, convoluted connection of traps to trigger on the first unsuspecting enemy. 

 

The first series in any good Rube Goldberg trap machine has to be Entangling Nets.  After the enemy is ensnared, their weight in the nets sets off the next reaction, pulling up a series of Poisoned Stakes, jabbing the enemy forcefully they bounce into the air, pulled slightly by the nets further into the machine. They land in an Ithilien Pit - and what pit is complete without a series of Ranger Spikes there to poke holes in all the right places.  As the blood drains from the enemy, it sets off another pulley, jerking the holey enemy out of the pit, where they find that they were actually in an Ambush the entire time and didn't notice THAT was actually the first trap in the series!  Then, as they sit there confused at all the madness they've been through just to engage him, Aragorn drapes a Forest Snare over them and laughs.

Where do we get more traps? I've tried Damrod, but I seem to only have two traps -- Forest Snare and Ambush.  Forest Snare was great in helping me beat the first Lost Realm quest, but it seems hard to build a theme around two cards.

 

What expansions should I be looking at?

Thanks.  I don't have the Stormcaller expansions, and while I have the Heirs of Numenor series I've been holding off tackling it because of what I've herd about difficulty so I haven't opened any of the packages.
