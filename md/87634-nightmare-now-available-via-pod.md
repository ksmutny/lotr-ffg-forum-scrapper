It'll be good to finally see how all goes. I'm not anticipating getting very far, of course, but I am a very big fan of options.

nightmare decks are for the organized play and are "in season" for 6 months. so, you will always have to wait until 6 months after they release to game stores to get your hands on them. so, the new ones probably won't be available until january or february.

I don't like the nightmare idea and it's art, thrilling...

I go loog every day your facebook page and i love second Nightmare pack. I really like HFG quest but is so easy (special now) so i dont really play it anymore. But now with this new N cards wow.  I love the wargs they come they fight with you and in refresh they call for Hunters. Really cool mechanic.

yeah, it is a cool mechanic! i've see a few folks say that the nightmare hunt for gollum isn't all that hard though. i still need to play it, though.

"Due to variations in printing, cards from these Print on Demand scenarios may differ subtly in appearance and texture from Core Set cards, and players are thus encouraged to utilize opaque sleeves or art sleeves when playing in Nightmare Mode."

 

Has anyone checked this? Differences are easily visible with clear sleeves?

With the previous two PODs, the cards have been noticeably paler/lighter, which is no big deal if the whole scenario is like that but if mixed in with an older encounter deck...you can def tell the difference. Edited August 2, 2013 by Pharmboys2013
