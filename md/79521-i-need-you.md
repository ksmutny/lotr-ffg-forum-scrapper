Hello Middle-Earth warriors!

I am here to ask you for your sword. Or to be more precise, your Photoshop brush.
Currently I'm working on a variant project of a Campaign Mode [http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/930659/campaign-mode] for this game, and it'll be based on a World-Map of Middle-Earth.

What I need is someone who wishes to help. Someone who can draw one (or adapt one) map of Middle-Earth with some tweaks needed to function together with my future mode.


You can answer here, send PM or even mail me (cordeirooo@gmail.com).
The latter is the fastest contact.


Thank you!
