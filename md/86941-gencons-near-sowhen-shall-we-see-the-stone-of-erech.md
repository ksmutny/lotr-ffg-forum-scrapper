Nice to see a toe at least. Where and when was it described that the new PoD will be The Stone of Erech?

Not so sure about it. We must wait another 6 months at least. But i made proxy and play after someone put images to net.

After buy a original ones.

I don't believe it was officially announced (i.e. on the FFG website). Someone picked it up on the GenCon website, looking at the schedule.

This was new to me, FFG are keeping it close this time!

 

Having said that, Google has helped a bit, found the following links with a little information -

Massing at Osgiliath was available for order around September 21 while Battle for Laketown was available for order around October 15.

 

So, I think we can expect this one to go POD sometime around those dates.

Hopefully we can get this quest soon to relieve some of us from all these really easy quests we've been getting recently......Cant wait to lose bad again and for it to take awhile to figure out how to win a quest.  All these recent ones you win on your first try and I'm like "Thats it?" "Wow that was easy"

That how i feel from the emin muil. I know that feeling, you get new pack and win easy from the first time. Hate it.

NM is cool. You will love it. But we must to wait a lot to get it. I dont like it.

Why easy and normal there straight away and for NMa we must way about a year?

I still cant get any of the nightmare packs.  I went to a FFG store an hour away and they dont have it and I've looked everywhere online and its nowhere.  Guess I'll just have to wait. :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

Just make a proxy and put in in sleeves and play. Images you can get in internet i suppose.

You will like it. Specialy JDTA and DG.

Still remember the first time I try Osgiliath, a easy victory for orcs. :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]
