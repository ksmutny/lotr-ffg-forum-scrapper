1.) One

2.) You don´t . Normally you explore it by putting progress tokens on it in the quest phase after quest resolution.

3.) discard pile

4.) nothing

5.) You have to search for one spider.......so you can search for Ungoliant´s Spawn ( which is a spider) and put it into the stagging area.
      So you don´t have to wait until it comes up.

 Ty. for answering I understand everything except answer on number 4.)! Is that mean that after I complete quest "monster" and location stay on the stagging area or?

 Yes, why should´t they.

If you advance from on stage of the quest to another, nothing in the staging area changes unless it is mentioned somewhere.

Shadow cards are dealt to enemies at the start of the Combat Phase instead of the Encounter Phase, and the Shadow cards are discarded at the end of the Combat Phase (unless the enemy with that Shadow card is killed during Combat, then the Shadow card is discarded together with that enemy at that moment).
