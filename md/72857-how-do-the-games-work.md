I've been reading up on the LCG and thinking about getting it.  It says it's good for 1-2 players, but the expansion packs say they're good for 1-4.  Can anyone explain how this works to me so I'll know what to expect before buying a bunch of stuff I can't use?

you only get 2 threat controllers in the core set, whilst the ad packs are just the quests with the player cards

if you get extra threat dials and tokens and have enough ad packs you can play 3-4 players with just 1 core set…youll just be limiting your  deck building options
