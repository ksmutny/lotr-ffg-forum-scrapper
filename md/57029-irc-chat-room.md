Is there an irc chat room for LOTR card game?  If not I could make one it would be nice to have an actually room for chatting.

 I'm for anything like that really.  There's also VOIP like Ventrillo.  I was event thinking of doing live games on something like Ustream, viewers could make suggestions while we play.  There's so many options with technology these days.
