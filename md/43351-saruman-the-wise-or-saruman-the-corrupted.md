Actually, I think, we may eventually see both versions. It's not unusual for a LCG to have different versions of unique characters.

Considering the time frame I would expect the wise. At least at first.

Fallen-Wizard Saruman remains one of my favourite pieces of art from Meccg and an allaround cool character (at least if not playing competitive, Beorning Skin-changers will ruin your day). A New Ringlord FTW cool.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/cool.gif] .

Yea considering the time frame we must have him as an ally.But on the other hand having Gandalf ,Radagast,Saruman and Galadriel with Nenya at that moment is like  having the dream team at Olympics (1994).Oh and dont forget Glorfindel gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]

No Alatar and Pallando in this game though, as they were from Unfinished Tales. MECCG Alatar would have been excellent in this game, chasing down enemies happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]

I thibnk we will  see boath versions of Saruman. Just like we will get Thorin Oakshield as a Hero in the core set  - if You're a Tolkien fan You know that Thorin died at the end of The Hobbit.

Oh Ithryn Luin.We know almost nothing about their fate and their powers.

Saruman says to Gandalf that he wants the staffs of all five wizards for himself in the book of two towers but i dont know if FFG can use them cause their names never mentioned in Hobbit or the lord of the rings books.

Yea also Thorin and Eowyn are from different time lines and Eowyn is in the core set.

Only promblem is wen we get  Saruman of many colors (evil Saruman) what happens then ? You cant have a unique character with free peoples and shadow side in the same game.

If he turns while he is in play on the Free side, I could see him doing something nasty (damage, imprisonment) and then getting removed from the game, coming into play on the Shadow side demonio.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/demonio.gif] .

That's not a problem in a card game in my opinion. Maybe it disturbs the chronology of events that were in all the books but  the mechanic still alows to have an enemy an ally with the same name but different abilities in the game.

Yea mechanic isnt a promblem. But having Saruman fighting him self its not so good idea dont you think?

I think a most reasonable way to have them both is somethink like Darns idea.You can have Saruman with free peoples and a Saruman in shadow deck but wen evil Saruman comes in play and free peoples Saruman is allready in game you must discard him(or the oposite).

Sorry my English arent so good i hope you can understand what i mean sad.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sad.gif]

Just as an aside, and I can't vouch for the truth of this for the English version, but a moderator on the French FFG fora, Dadajef, who also was a proofreader for the French edition's rules, states that apparently neither Thorin nor Celeborn are in the core set.

I like this thread. It hits on something that the Decipher CCGs have played on before. They did this with Gollum in their LOTR game. Granted, he was a little more troubled than Saruman, but the same idea applies. When he is on the Free Peoples side, it represents helping them along. On the Dark side it is him doing things hidden and behind the scenes to hurt the Free Peoples. When he is fighting himself, it's him struggling with his own loyalties or trying to hide his evil intentions from his allies among the free peoples. I personally wouldn't mind him on both sides of the game.

That's interesting, thanks for the news.

Worst think about Desipher's game was Gimli,Gandalf.Boromir and Galadriel as ringbearers.I still cant believe  they did somethink like this.
