Hopefully this is not too noobish a question. If I have gone through a combat phase and have used all my heros or/and allies to attack and I have 1 or more surviving enemys I am engaged with does the threat from the enemy I am engaged with count as part of the threat levels I have to face in the next quest phase?

Thanks,

 

Dave

Only items in the staging area count towards threat when questing. Engaged enemies and active locations do not count while questing.
