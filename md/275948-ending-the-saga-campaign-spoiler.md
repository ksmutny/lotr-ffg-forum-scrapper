If you don't want to know the campaign ending do not read further.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The first time I played the campaign I did not rip up the ring.  I wasn't sure of that interpretation of the ending.  It says "destroy" the card.  Destroy is a game term that means send to the discard pile.  Nowhere did I find instruction to literally tear up a card.  However in that sentence the phrase "One Ring card" made it sound like it was out side of the normal gameplay.  

I'm about to start a campaign with my wife, and if the the card must die to win then I want us to play it right.  Besides it would be cool if she ended as first player and had to make the decision.  So if anyone knows an official answer to "do we physically destroy the card?" I would like to hear it.

Pretty sure the answer is yes, you're supposed to physically destroy the card.

I like that it's ambiguous.

Don’t they include 4 copies so you can destroy one and still have 3?

We sure have many one ring since any saga deluxe have his own. But the destruction is only fictional. I don't think they intent to make us destroy the card. But ff course at the end no matter what dev have in your mind you can do it or not, it is your choice ;).

I find the Lotr lcg to be one of the most replayable of episodic games.  I could easily see myself playing the saga campaign more than 4 times in my life.  Although I do find the idea of continual card destruction intriguing.  Each play after a win would have an exponentially harder choice.  I don't know if I would be impressed or disgusted by someone who had chosen card destruction 4 times.  Ambiguity is perhaps the best solution.  Let those who aren't comfortable tearing up a card win with a clean conscience.  Personally, I think I'll let my wife decide how to interpret it on this playthrough.
