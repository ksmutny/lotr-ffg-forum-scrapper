# [We Need More Avatars To Show Off This Great Art!](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60786-we-need-more-avatars-to-show-off-this-great-art/)

The art for this game continues to absolutely blow me away. Definitely some of the best I've ever seen for a card game. I love it.

What we need is some more of this great art in the Avatar section. There's not nearly enough! Just mainly some base set ones, a few Massing ones and a few random Khazad ones.

And I want to proudly display some of the cool art from the Adventure packs. Some of that art has DEFINITELY been worthy of an avatar! More likely, worthy of some sort of award, but at least an avatar!

For example, I would possibly KILL for a Haldir of Lorien avatar.

What are some ones you would like to see? Maybe if we name enough awesome ones, FFG will add a few more!

agreed, i would give my left manhood for the elrohir artwork :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

saying that though id be hesitant to change it, as most people know me by my avatar as no one else uses it, so it would probably confuse some people, i know i used to get glaurung and lightdarker (i think thats right) mixed up when they used the same ones

Yeah, this is another good reason I think we need some more. There's so few that a bunch of common LotRLCG posters kind of get mixed up to me as well.

Yes sure we need some more!

They did it!

There's a bunch of new avatars, including Haldir, Gildor, Bilbo, Elfhelm, Boromir, Prince Imrahil, Dunedain Watcher, Silvan Tracker, Grimbeorn, two of the Carrock Trolls, Song of Battle, and upcoming Arwen, Elrohir, and who is presumably Elladan!

Thanks FFG!

Hah, yeah yours is a cool one and I do usually recognize you from it.

I'm just one of those people who kept changing my avatar like once a week because of OCD and not finding one I liked enough, or finding one but it wasn't "perfect" because it wasn't for LotRLCG, my favorite FFG game.

Lol.

I hate to look a gift horse in the mouth, but I would have liked to see Attercop, Attercop. I'm sticking with the spider themes since I study arachnids.

Yeah, lots of people just don't give 'em the time of day. It's like an in-born discrimination against anything with more than 4 limbs. I'm currently working on a Ph.D., by the way (to answer your first question).
