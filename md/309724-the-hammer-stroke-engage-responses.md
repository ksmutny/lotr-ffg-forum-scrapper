Can I use Sam's response ability if I playÂ The Hammer-stroke when the enemies are already engaged with me?

No. An enemy is said to engage a player when it moves into that player's area from another game location.

Page 7 Online Rules Reference:

Engaged:
When an enemy enters a playerâ€™s play area from another game location, that enemy has engaged that player, and that player has engaged that enemy.

That's an interesting text in this situation. Perhaps it would be better worded to say "each non-immune not engaged with you engages you." I believe that is the intent on the card.
