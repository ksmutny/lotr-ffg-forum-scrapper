Hi all.  I'm going to start playing this game with my son and fiance, and was wondering if it would be possible for us to play using just one core set.  I don't have a ton of money to sink into it, and I want to make sure they like it before we try to make any real investment.

You can play with just one core and 3 players (taking one colour each but not full sized decks) - smaller decks is what the core was designed to run.

 

You will be very limited in what you can do in terms of deck construction (which is what a lot of the game is when you get into it). 

 

I've run core only games as tasters for 3 and 4 players and they work just fine for that, getting a taste.

Long term you're going to want a second core, or to invest in say an entire cycle (so that you can make 3  full-size decks). I think one cycle + 1 deluxe expansion makes it possible with only 1 core.

Sleeves and proxies for the win.

Yeah, if you're building out of just one core box, you'll want to stick to around 30 card decks, even if you're playing solo or with just one other person. Other than that, the game should play just fine.

 

You can also always track threat on paper or with dice, so you shouldn't feel the need to buy another core just for tokens and threat trackers.

Yes, you certainly can. But, you will be extremely restrained and possibly lose a whole lot if you'll go anywhere outside of Mirkwood.

You can get a lot of enjoyment from the core set. It can be difficult, the third quest in particular, but if it was easy it wouldn't have much replayability.

Same here. Not buying two more core sets to be able to run a game with 3 Unexpected Courages.

Sure you can enjoy yourself with only one core set. Just do not follow the "tournament deck" requirements. The game will be plenty hard even without it.

I could never understand why FFG only put one of some of the cards in the core instead of three. I don't buy the explanation that they do it keep the core set balanced. I tend to think of it is they just want you to spend more money and buy two or three core sets. Scan away at those cards and use card sleeves to cover the dupes from the reals. I only support this if you already have purchased at least one copy of the card being duped. I do not support the duping of cards from friends if you don't own a copy of that particular card.

The explanation is that they wanted to provide a range of cards. (More than you would get if you only had 3 of each).

 

I personally would have preferred two quests and more player cards in the core. Especially considering that Dol Guldor was a lottery to win anyway.

Yeah, while I have defeated Escape from Dol Guldur using Core set cards only (50-card decks, solo, 2-handed, and 2-player), I don't think that quest should have been included in the Core set. IMO, they probably should have put another level 4-6 difficulty quest in the Core set and released Escape from Dol Guldur as part of an adventure pack cycle.

 

Still, while I have absolutely no regrets about my Core set purchase and have enjoyed the challenge and replay value of the harder quests contained therein, I have never played the game in anything other than solo or 2-player mode, so can't comment on how well three 30-card decks out of the Core set will perform against Journey Along the Anduin and Escape from Dol Guldur.

 

Good luck, WillisRBC, welcome to the game… and maybe let us know how it goes?

 

I hope you, your son, and fiancee enjoy it as much as many of us do!
