Hi people,

 

Actually I get the copy of Carrock, and I have a questin that I did not find on FAQ or in other post:

 

Carrock is immune to card effects. I understood that card effect is the effects of events. The abilities (response effects) of some characters (Legolas, Elf Scout) are considered car effects to the rules or they happens because they´re abilities ? I am playing like Carrock is immune to them, so when Legolas participate on a kill of a Troll he does not put 2 tokens on The Carrock, but I am not 100% sure.

 

Thanks !

That is the right way.

 Note: I believe Carrock is immune to player card effects. Slight distinction, as there are other cards in the game that are immune to all card effects. This does matter, for example when dealing with certain encounter cards that force you to travel, for example.
