 I've been using sleeves, almost since I first got my hands on the core set, but I'm starting to get tempted to unsleeve my cards.

The colors are slightly better without the sleeves and they feel better in my hand.

Still I have not decided yet.

 

What's your take on sleeves? Do you use them? Anyone who has stopped useing them?

I always use sleeves for the card games I play a lot. That whay the stay in the same shape as I bought them.
They get damaged much easier other wise with shuffling and playing in my opinion.

oddly enough, i use sleeves for LOTR but not AGoT. typically, though, i sleeve everything as it really does lengthen the life of my cards.

I always keep my decks sleeved in every TCG/LCG I play.  I also keep my encounter decks sleeved.  I use different colored backs for each of my decks and encounter decks so that I don't mix them up.

I don't use sleeves in deck-building games, such as Dominion.

 I agree with madgoblin, and i keep sleeved all my cards except for the encounter decks.

no i dont- never have, probably never will. i had a big argument on a thread just like this months back with someone who shall remain unnamed. i wa trying to get through to them that it is actually possible to not be able to afford sleeves- even those penny sleeves. see i only just can afford to keep up with the pack and usually have to save up so i can buy them. once you add postage into that then im already slightly behind in being able to buy them on time….all this adds up to one thing- i can either have my cards unsleeved, or i can not have them at all….

besides- thing that annoys me is there seems to be this 'protection' patronisation thing going on from certain experienced players trying to convince new players that they HAVE TO buy sleeves lest they die a horrible death (not anyone on this forum….dont get madlengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif]) …something that ive only ever seen appear one other place….and that also involves the word 'protection'……only the latter is justified

now dont get me wrong- im not saying sleeves are bad- they are certainly a good idea, and my cards most certainly will be more ragged than if id sleeved them, but its still a personal choice

anyways- thats a long way of saying 'no'

I don't. I'm just extremely careful about them and doing my best to avoid any damage or else to them.

they are pretty durable….more so than they look. ive been playing since over a year ago and the only cards showing wear to be concerned about are one the gandalfs and the entire set of road to rivendell which werent printed correctly in the first place….so thats 1 card in my entire collection that has came about through play (almost every day)

i guess it could be a problem if you look at your deck and see the back of a worn card and know whats coming….but ive trained myself out of doing that so even when a gandalf is sitting at the top i dont notice

i can understand sleeving for this reason though

I always used sleeves for my card games.  Otherwise, I found them to get worn and ragged, as was the case when I first played Star Wars CCG and didn't use sleeves.  Once I noticed what was happening, I've used sleeves ever since.

Road to Rivendell set is printed incorrectly? How so?

 i dont sleeve my cards…..i'd probably prefer too but since i'm constantly making new decks depending on if i'm playing solo or with friends and constantly shuffling the encounter decks together it would only be effective if i sleeved every card in my collection which is too much of a chore for me to bother with.  I just try and keep them in as good as a condition as possible.  so far the only noticeable wear on the cards is the edges

all 4 sides of every card in the pack inc. encounter cards, all have slightly (but noticable) wear, as if they have been very hardly shuffled for a few months before being packed….not sure what happened but it takes so long to get them here in uk that i couldnt be bothered sending them  back

Sleeves indeed cost quite a lot (~7€ for 100 in my town), but I still sleeve any card game I play (well, not when the cards have a really strange size, like Domonion…).

I do realize it means I spent about 40€ on sleeves since the game started, but this ensures a long lifespan for my cards (which will eventually be unavailable), so I find this is very necessary.

 What kind of sleeves do you guys use?

The only "penny sleeves" I can imagine are the ones that are just like card-sized plastic baggies, but I can't imagine those doing too much to protect the cards. I'm on the fence about this because I want to preserve my cards but I don't really want the trouble/expense. Collecting all these LOTR cards from ground zero is pricey enough.

i use FFG's sleeves, they are the best i've found, and you can find them for really low prices online.

Ultra Pro penny sleeves for me. Yes, they are very thin, but for example, I've played 3,400+ games of WWE Raw Deal since getting that game in August 2008, haven't had to replace a single sleeve and certainly the cards inside have no sign of wear on them because they've been sleeved. I can't even imagine what they would look like without sleeves. Of course, I can say that without them being in sleeves, I wouldn't have played the game nearly as much. Not only do sleeves make shuffling easier, you can also shuffle more stress-free, knowing the edges and corners won't take any damage.

If a game uses these Magic-sized cards, like LotR LCG does, I use penny sleeves. There is no need for more expensive premium sleeves IMO, extra money is wasted since penny sleeves do the job for a lot less. It's only the non-Magic-size cards, like games that use FFG's mini and medium-sized cards (picked up Descent 2.0 this week), penny sleeves don't work with those, so for those games, have to grab more specialized sleeves, Arcane Tinmen sleeves being my sleeve of choice here (for the same price as FFG sleeves, I get 100 AT sleeves in a pack, vs 50 sleeves from FFG).

 I use Ultra Pro premiums.

 

I like the texture of the harder plastic, and I also use the ones that are completely clear for a uniform feel and they are much easier to cleave together to do a shuffle

I used to use the FFG sleeves, with the special Lord of the Rings pictures on  the back, but i have goine back to using Ultro Pro 66mm ones.

I don't think the FFG ones fit very well… there are sizeable gaps around all four edges of the card, and because the inside of the sleeve is white, you get an ugly white border around all of the cards. A lot of the card art is very dark and black, so having a white border around it doesnt look good.

The Ultra Pro 66mm ones fit absolutely perfect, and they also seem a bit sturdier

 Always. I sleeve everything…even though I play both solo and multi…I simply change some cards and that's easily done…my collector attitude speaks for myself I'm afraid…I consider it a mistreatment on a piece of art not sleeving them. I use only Dragonshield, green for encounter cards and purple for player cards…

I sleeve all my cards in FFG sleeves. I didn't sleeve at first, but after a few games I noticed some wear and tear at the corners on some of the cards. To me, the feel and the quality of these cards doesn't seem as good as Magic cards, which I've rarely sleeved in the years that I've played. It also makes shuffling easier so there's that too.

i use Dragon Shields.. I think they are but far the best sleeve and also the best fit for LCG cards… FFG sleeves are to tall and I have to spend an hour slicing the top off each sleeve.

Yeah, Dragon Shields are great. I use those for the encounter cards, but I bought some of the LE art sleeves for my player decks because, well, I'm a sucker for things like that.

I sleeve all of them, always did for all my games. I use the Ultra Pro cheap ones, they are enough for me. They do the job to the date.

 I would use Dragonshield if I could (that is, if my local store could have them), but instead I use black Ultra Pro for encounter cards and clear hard Ultra Pro sleeve for player cards. Since the cards are all in good condition, no advantage in being gain by seeing the actual card, and that lets us enjoy the nice art at the back of the card :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 I use Ultra Pro penny sleeves. But apparently the size changed on the newer ones and they are a little longer now. So I had to re-sleeve all my cards and put only the encounter deck cards in the new sleeves and the player cards in the old, shorter sleeves.

 Yes, Ultra Pro repeatedly have changed the size of their sleeves in the past few years. This is quite annoying, but since we don't mix cycles in this game, this is less problematic.

I don't sleeve my cards, and have no problems to date. I so very rarely play though that the wear and tear issue isn't really a problem. Maybe once a month is about my average, though now the long dark (haha) nights are coming I might break it out more often once again. Some of my other games that might get a bit more attention, Warhammer or AGoT, some of those cards are ever so slightly buckled, almost, but that's nothing that I can't live with. LotR is my game for me, though, and I'm very careful, almost compulsively so, with my cards, so I don't foresee this being a problem anytime soon.

Plus, when it comes down to it, I'd rather spend money on games than on sleeves…

I use FFG sleeves for my LOTR cards, and plan to for future games as well.  Even though I live near FFG, I buy my products online so that the cards+sleeves end up being cheaper than just the cards alone at the normal retail price.  Doing it that way, I feel it's a good investment.

Yeah it doesn't matter how careful you are you will wear the cards edges, and one day eventually you will screw up and bend the card or spill something on it, or it will warp in the cold or w/e.

I have always sleeved cards from the various games I have played.  Usually just the Ultra Pro sleeves, but for this game I have used the FFG sleeves up til now.  I'm not hard-core about it.  It's really the same reasoning that Rich has, just with a deifferent conclusion.  I am lucky enough to be able to drop a few extra doallrs to pick up the sleeves in addition to the game.  And though the cards are durable, I have a 6-year old and a 6-month old.  You could make the **** things out of adamantium and kids would find a way to put them through hell.  Just precautionary on my part.

On a related note, it's been a bit of a hassle lately to do so.  I've tried to be a "purist" and have all my player deck cards in FFG's Ring-backed sleeves, and the encounter cards in the Eye-backed sleeves.  But since FFG hasn't printed any more of them in AGES, and the card count keeps raising, I've had to move everything around to various other sleeves.  So if they don't fix their production/distribution issues rather quickly, I'll have to figure out something else…
