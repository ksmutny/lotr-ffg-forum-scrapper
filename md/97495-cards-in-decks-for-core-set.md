Hey guys, just got my core set in a few days ago and read the rules and watched some tutorials, I separated my decks out. My question is how many cards am I supposed to have in each sphere deck? I separated them all out and I have 33 cards per deck. This includes the gandalf for each one and the 3 heros. Just wondering if that's the correct amount. I don't find anywhere in the rules, like usual, that states, ok now you should have this many in this deck Ect. I guess I'm asking because in some of the tutorials it appears they have more cards than that, but that could be because they are sleeved as well. I think I got everything else separated well for my first scenario. Took all the 3 different cards that show same emblems as scenario cards out for encounter deck, and have all 4 cards for scenario. So i think I'm good. The preconstructed core decks just feel a little lite. Thanks again and I can't wait to get my first solo questing underway!

With just the core set staying mono-sphere with 30 or 33 is completely fine IMO.  It is mentioned in the rulebook that 'tournament' decks use a minimum of 50.  You can certainly try making a dual-sphere deck with 50 cards, but until you start adding adventure packs/expansions its tough to get a good 50 card deck.

I thought there were 40 per sphere in the core...

Nope. 30 or 33 depending on the Gandalves.

I have exactly 33 for each deck, including the 3 heroes and 1 gandalf. I looked at a card directory and went with core set and only one sphere and sure enough it showed 32 cards for each faction not including the one gandalf per deck. It will tell you 18 cards but some are multiples.

Just a note: Heroes do not count towards the deck size. And minimum deck size must be 50. I recommend you to start blending spheres as soon as possible, basic monodecks are extremely weak on their own.

If you are playing with just the monsphere core decks solo  I suggest you play with 3 gandalfs in each deck he is the best card in the set and that is the maximum you can play of any card in a deck.

Thanks for the info guys! Hope all stays well with this game. Its fun, but at the same time a bummer getting into it after so many expansions and adventure packs are out and you keep feeling compelled to get another and another quick..lol. Im staying with core set now for some initial learning then im gonna go in order and get hunt for gollum to start. Thanks again

I know the feeling. I just started 2 weeks ago and feel a bit overwhelmed with all the catch-up that is needed. Managed 2 expansions and 7 APs so far. I'm loving this game far and beyond what I was expecting.

Yeah, that's definitely a downside of the LCG model. If it makes you feel better, it could be much worse. I've always wanted to expand beyond the Game of Thrones Core Set, but don't fancy dropping a grand to collect everything.

Regarding the expense of the game, I really feel as though I've received my money's worth.  I recently totaled up everything I've spent on LOTR LCG and it came out less than a single tier 1 MtG deck.  So it's very reasonable after all.  But I hear you.  I'm thinking of branching into CoC or aGoT and I feel SO behind that it's a little daunting.

I hear ya on the mtg. I played that for awhile, and still have a few decks made my buddy and I can get a quick game in at lunch usually. You can drop a load of cash on those cards. That's why I'm venturing to other style card games. Just like to know what I'm getting for my money and have a ton of replay value.

I think the saga packs are the best jumping in points for new players. They give a good bang for the buck, have nice cards as well as the quest being very integrated and thematic. It is also a lot easier to get the 3 saga packs or just Black Riders than to find 12 APs

CoC is the best constructed game ever made.. period.

Yes, la1cajun. Up to now I've been playing solo.

I disagree.  I think the Hobbit Saga quests are really mediocre and most of the player cards are well, just not the cards that fit in to decks as well as AP cards dd.   I would say its far better to get Black Riders and then start collecting the dwarrowdelf or Mirkwood cycle. And Khazad-Dum if you want the Dwarrowdelf.
