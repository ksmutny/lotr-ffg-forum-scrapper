# [Design cards, Strange Eons 3 plug-in](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85255-design-cards-strange-eons-3-plug-in/)

## 1 [HeavyKaragh on June 18, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85255-design-cards-strange-eons-3-plug-in/?do=findComment&comment=804496)

A plugin that allows fans to design their own cards is available on the Strange Eons 3 catalog.

I found a good YouTube tutorial on installation and basic usage, thanks to The Kirkwood Runner: Strange Eons tutorial [https://youtu.be/owf5qNIeZ7A]

Instalation and usage guide: http://susurrosdelbosqueviejo.blogspot.com.es/2014/09/how-to-create-cards-with-strange-eons.html [http://susurrosdelbosqueviejo.blogspot.com.es/2014/09/how-to-create-cards-with-strange-eons.html]

Also, for any questions regarding plugin usage or bugs, you can contact me too on Twitter with the nick of HeavyKaragh or by email at heavykaragh at gmail dot com.

Current version is beta 17.

Strange Eons: http://cgjennings.ca/eons/index.html [http://cgjennings.ca/eons/index.html]

It seems that updating the plugin trough the catalog may not work as expected. If you find yourself without proper encounter set or collection lists, you have to reinstall the plugin.

Any of you can solve this following these steps:

 1. Open Strange Eons and press F12 (or open the menu Tools>Manage).
 2. On the left list, for each The Lord of the Rings plugin part: select it press the "uninstal" button on the bottom right of the window.
 3. Close the window and Strange Eons.
 4. Open Strange Eons and press Shift+12 (or open the menu Tools>Catalog), and install the plugin.


I've been reported this problem 3 times, but I don't know if this is common or where lies the problem. If any of you have this problem, leave a message here. Writing "update problem" is enough.

Beta 1 released.

Custom sphere and difficulty cards can be created.

Card templates designed to be uploaded directly to PrinterStudio. Users can "cut" the card with a button.

 

Coments and bugs are welcome.

Nice to see LOTR to get past Strange eons 2.x. Are there golden icons for easy mode cards? Or templates for own nighmare versions? They would be cool. Have to play with this version so I can compare it to 2.3.

Still has the bug on Macs where formatting (bold, italic, underline) doesn't work. Not sure if that can be fixed or not.

Easy ring is included, but without the real thing in hands not much can be done, and something similar was done. Also, Nightmare templates will be included when I can get my hands on them.

The Mac bug seems to be a Strange Eons problem. Does it happen with other games? You should coment it in the SE forums.

If you mean the issue where on Macs fonts included with a plug-in don't get made into a family properly, so applying bold/italic doesn't use the bold/italic versions of the font (that are also included in the plug-in):

Based on my testing, that has been resolved since the build of SE that switched from requiring Java 6 to the one requiring Java 7. I think it was the one released around the start of April. The problem was due to a bug in Apple's implementation of Java 6. I reported it to them, but nothing ever happened with it. (As is typically the case with Apple, there is no way to know if anyone even looked at it, let alone tried to fix it.) With Java 7, Apple's font library isn't being used anymore, so the problem solved itself. This was actually one of the main reasons I decided to require Java 7.

If you mean some other problem with bold/italic, I'm not sure what you mean. You'll have to provide more information.

By the way, over the last couple of months a lot of OS X-specific issues have been resolved. If you haven't updated SE3 lately, it'd be a good idea to do so. If in doubt about whether to bother updating, you can check the Twitter feed (@StrangeEons) to get a quick summary of the most important changes. There are usually 1 or 2 updates a month.

Cheers,
Chris

Thanks for the thorough reply. I'll have to do some testing, and make sure I have everything set up the way it needs to be. Basically, the issue is that the bold and italic functions don't work, and they don't register on the actual card. I'll check it out though, and make sure that I'm not doing something wrong on my end.

Not sure what I did, but it looks like the issue was just that it didn't update to SE3 correctly. Anyway, it's working perfectly now, and I'm loving the new version!

I'm looking to upgrade to the new release however I can't seem to load my old (strange eons 2) files into the new version.

I get a warning that arkham.sheet.CharacterSheet.$DeckSnappingHintClass is missing. Any ideas how to get around this issue?

Both versions of the plugins are incompatible because they are very different. Now you have 2 options:

 1. Keep using Strange Eons 2 untill you finish your card set. I checked that the old plugin's compatibility with Strange Eons 3 has been lost..
 2. Update your cards manually to the new plugin. Strange Eons 2 has the Picture Thief plugin that let's you get the portraits from your cards' files. That and copying the text to notepad should be enough to update the cards rapidly.

I suppose I have a compability problem when I use your tool and install some other plugins.

My cards show no name, no values for Attack, defense, quest, cost, hit Points etc.

 

If I use any of the tags like <will> or <lea> the text dissapears at a certain point, starting with the position where the icon should have appeared. In this case the text box also gets completly surrounded by a red dotted line as if I entered too much text.

 

I know this is rather vague, and as nobody else seems to have this problemit is probably not very high on your priority list. But if I can assist you in any way with this, please contact me.

Beta 2 WIP

Work-In-Progress versions are for people that love the thrill of losing previous work. I advise you: Before using your cards created with beta 1, make a backup of your cards to avoid painfull loses!

This version has known problems. Use it only for testing purposes.

 

Important changes for users

 * Beta1 cards should load properly, but I haven't tested it as much as I wanted. If you open a beta 1 card that uses something not found in the instalation, like an official Encounter Set icon, a message will appear telling what's missing. If you save the card at this moment, you'll lose your original work. Also, I remind you that this version is incompatible with the old Strange Eons 2 version of the plugin.
 * Now, tag buttons can be found in the context bar. You can add the buttons through the Preferences>Context Bar menu.
 * LotR category in New menu has dissapeared, and cards are distributed though the regular categories. You can filter LotR cards with the selector in the upper-right corner.
 * Card stats' rendering and some templates have been changed to make it more consistent between versions and pretier (and it will change just a bit more in beta3). If you are working on a card set, you should keep using beta1 untill you finish your card set to make sure you've got them all looking similar. Then, you can make a backup of your cards and try loading them with this beta2.

Instalation

This version won't be available in the Strange Eons catalogue untill is tested. It must be installed manually. Here you can find it: http://www.4shared.com/folder/j5xWZRBW/WIP.html [http://www.4shared.com/folder/j5xWZRBW/WIP.html]

 

I've changed how the plugin is distributed, to make it easier to maintain. Now there are 7 packages instead of 2:

 * The plugin, containing Core Set components and spheres: TheLordOfTheRingsLCG.seext
 * Additional components appeared later (Objective Ally, Treasure and 3 accesory): TheLordOfTheRingsLCG-P.seext

 * Addtional sphere and difficulty variants (Baggins, Easy and customs): TheLordOfTheRingsLCG-V.seext. Note that the Easy circle is just something similar and may not look the same as the official cards.

 * Addtional official Encounter Set and Collection icons: TheLordOfTheRingsLCG-I.seext

 * 3 high definition add-ons.

 

Only the main plug-in is required to create cards, but you may need to install the P, V and I packages to keep compability with cards created with beta 1. The HD packages are recomended only for printing. The easiest way to install these packages is to unpack the ZIP file and open the seext files through StrangeEons' File menu.

I've also seen the problem with the tags. I hope it's fixed in this version for everyone, because the problem seems a bit random (seems a mixture of a bad font file and SE version changes and who knows what more). If you have the plugin opened as a project (that is, like you were be developing it) and also have it installed normally, you may see this problem.

 

For the compatibility problem, if it persists, tell me wich plugins you have installed, SE version and operative sistem you are using.

 

I'll be on vacation for 2 weeks. And I couldn't test this version as much as needed to release it. Please, when you test it a few days (mostly saving and loading cards), tell me the result so I can tell Chris (Strange Eons' creator) to upload it to the catalogue.

Thanks for the realy fast reply. I istalled the 7 packages. All Icons, stats etc seem to display normaly. I have not encountered any heavy side effects yet. I have one minor error though:

Whenever I load a previously saved card for the first time or if I change the portrait, I get this error:

Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method "setImage" of undefined
 at res:TheLordOfTheRingsLCG/diy/library.js:316 (drawImages)
 at res:TheLordOfTheRingsLCG/diy/library.js:640 (paintFront)
 

This has no negative effect however, the card looks fine and saves and behaves normaly.

 

Oh and finaly: Have a nice trip :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] I will be creating some more Cards in the next days and post my findings.

Beta 2 WIP Error Report

The portrait problem mentioned in my last post seems to be connected to the thumbnail in the properties section. It does not appear when I load a card, but when I simply select it for the first time.

 

Tags are not always displayed correctly. They simply do not appear on the card. This time however the area to the left of the Portrait containig name, cost, defense, hit points etc. is not affected, and the rules text does not simply stop where the tag should be displayed.

 

If I use the shadow section or the shadow tag, the red dotted box appears and all the rules text is displayed in one line. The shadow and flavour text do not appear on the card at all.

 

The last two problems are acting strangly. They appeared after 3 days of using the plugin without any incident. It began as I had about 12 cards open at the same time. First the threat tag acted up, all the other stuff was normal. Attack, defense, all the other tags were displayed as they should be. Then the problem with the shadow text came along, and after that all the tags went mising.

When I create a new game component it is instantly affected by this.

Restarting the apllication or the PC has no effect.

 

System used: Windows 8, Strange eons 3 x64-b3693, Arkham Horror plugin installed

I will try this again with the Strange Eons  3 x32 in the next days.

> Beta 2 WIP Error Report

Thank you for the test. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

It seems definitelly the font file won't work properly depending on the renderer. Most problems are related to the font file. The problem is that I included the Shadow effect icon in the font file. It must be breaking the renderer because it's a weird glyph (much bigger than a letter or Spirit icon). Next week, I'll remove the Shadow effect icon from the font and include it as an image. That should do the trick.

The setImage error is easy to resolve.

The Lord of the Rings LCG plugin for Strange Eons beta 3 (christmas edition) released

The new version of the plugin is now available here: http://www.4shared.com/folder/uqHc5wNG/TheLordOfTheRingsLCG.html [http://www.4shared.com/folder/uqHc5wNG/TheLordOfTheRingsLCG.html]. To install it manually, just open the all the seext with Strange Eons and restart it. You also NEED to update Strange Eons. Not yet available in the Strange Eons repository.

 * New components and variants: Campaign card, Boon and Burden. Function is done, but the template images right now are of pretty low quality. Should be updated to something nice soon.
 * Help added in form of tip buttons.
 * Uniqueness button. No need to include tags in the name field.
 * Keyword field added.
 * Collection info field added.
 * Icons updated up to The Black Riders.
 * Change default copyright and collection info text in preferences.
 * Option to show or not advanced controls (tints and some texts)
 * Custom bleed margin was removed. Strange Eons has it's own system to add synthetic bleed margin to components. You can use it when in the window opened when exporting or in the deck options.

When loading components from previous versions, check portraits centering. Custom Sphere template has changed too, and can change more it's colour, old designs will look different but lowering the brightness should make them look the same. Also if you added more text than the number to the Collection Number field, you should move it to Collection Info field to show it properly.

If you find any problem (like when loading old components), please report it.

Anyone willing to translate the plugin to their own languaje contact me through private message.

Has anyone tried making cards with the newest version yet? - I've been trying just now, and noticed the symbols for attack/defence/willpower in the text seem to have gone - does anyone know how to insert them? i thought the html tags were <as> <ds> <ws> but that's not doing anything.

Those were for Strange Eons 2 plugin.

Now the symbols are inserted with the tags <att>, <def> and <will>. You can find a more complete reference in the blue button next to the Rules field.

 

If you find something not working properly/at all, say it here.

 

I was about to write this: Also, you can use the Context Bar section in the Preferences to include buttons for the icons. But I found it doesn't work. I have something to fix :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png].

A WIP update:

 * corrected a bug preventing card type texts to show is up.
 * the problem with context bar buttons not showing is fixed. 
 * draft templates added, you can select this option in the plugin Preferences.
 * Campaign and Attachment Boon card templates are in printable quality.

This update won't be available in the catalog, because I'm adding some more functions to the plugin. A manual installation is required: open Strange Eons, and then the seext files contained in the zip to install them.

 

If you find any problem post it here.

Noticed a bug with the custom sphere option. When I tried to export a card with a custom sphere template, it changed the template color back to the default. 

 

Also, the custom sphere template for heroes doesn't contain the space for custom icon on the card anymore (it did before, but today it was suddenly gone).

 

Using windows 8, if that helps.

If you are using Java RE version 8 on your PC, the plugin will through an error:


Uncaught java.util.UnknownFormatConversionException: Conversion = '>'


If that's the case, uninstall Java 8, download Java 7 (from here for Windows users [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/server-jre7-downloads-1931105.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnes]) and install it. It should work properly. If not, report it please.

 

I'll upload a new version of the plugin working with Java 8 in a few days.

Few issues, but the main is it doesent work as 7 either.

After issues of not even getting it to work in the first place I uninstalled Java and SE3 then installed Java 7 ( update 60 and tried 55) then reinstalled SE3. I can open the LOTR cards but still get the same error.

 

Also is there a better step by step guide then the one Hilarious Pete did? It is very outdated and the pictures are broken. I am really new to this program and nothing worked on getting the ability to make the LOTR cards.

 

Took a long time to figure out where to put the plug ins, stuck them in all folders possible in SE3.

 

Also where does that tar file go even?

 

Even after installing Java 7 . 60 and installing SE3, it said it cant find any versions of Java and that it can DL it for me?

 

Any help would be great!

> Few issues, but the main is it doesent work as 7 either.

 

Probably, Strange Eons is still using the java it downloaded (you can check it on the Help>About window, bottom left question box). First, let's try this:

 1. Download the zip file from one of the mirrors above, they are ready for Java 8. Unzip them somewhere.
 2. Open Strange Eons. Go to Toolbox>Manage Plugins. Uninstall every Lord of the Rings file from there.
 3. Close Strange Eons and open it. Drag and drop unziped files on the Strange Eons main window and install all of them.
 4. Close Strange Eons and open it. Try making a new card.

If this doesnt work:

 1. Close Strange Eons and uninstall it. Check both boxed when asked.
 2. From Control Panel, uninstall any java installed.
 3. Reboot your PC.

 5. Do the stuff from the previous list.

First method didnt work, still had error. so I tried the second. Nothing.

 

Looked in my program list and there was no Java at all so I reinstalled Java 7 Update 60.

 

Then I installed Java RE version 8. Had both Javas on computer now. Still got an error. Uninstalled Java 7 update 60 and rebooted

 

All I have is Java 8 update 8. No other Javas. Loaded SE3, and got the error:

 

uncaught java.util. UnknownFoormatConversionException: conversion = '>'

 

I use Windows 7 enterprise 64bit. am I missing something here still?

In the Plug In Catalog on installing the LOTR plug ins are there any for the first time that need to be installed? Maybe missing some. Here is what is checked for installing...

I had the problem of string conversion error that your guide says it is a problem of Java 8, but I had Java 7. Well, I just updated to the stable release and it worked fine. So no worries here.

 

This new version kick ass, it is very customizable and clear. 

 

Will you support nightmare quest card and alternative card art ? (those seen here for exemple http://octgn.gamersjudgement.com/wordpress/lotrlcg/2014/09/02/alternate-art-cards/) [http://octgn.gamersjudgement.com/wordpress/lotrlcg/2014/09/02/alternate-art-cards/)]

Beta 11 is up

A new version of the plugin is available in the catalog (shift+F12). Most code has been rewriten, and includes a lot of new features:

 * New components and templates: Quest Sheet, Rules Card, Gift card (a new, unofficial component explained here [http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/1224199/bananias-custom-cards-4-faction-cards]), Promo Hero, Nightmare Quest,  box Divider, Mastery sphere
 * Better project support: user can select initial collection and encounter set. Also, component translators can store their work on the same component. All this is explained in the preferences.
 * Global text options: in the preferences menu, user can select text alignmen for the components, These setings are applied to each loaded or exported component.

I've invested a lot of time testing and working on backward compatibility, and cards should work properly, even Strange Eons 2 cards has some support. But here is some stuff you should check for old cards: Encounter Set number, collection info, collection number and copyright may not load properly.

 

If you find any problem report it here.

Thanks for all of your work on this, karagh! I did want to make you aware of a bug related to the Promo hero. Every time you load a promo hero the artist, card number and any collection info (except the collection icon) are hidden on the bottom of the card. By toggling the promotional option on the template off then on again, they show up. However, even after doing this they will not export correctly. The only piece of collection-related info that is exported for promo cards is the collection icon, everything else is always left out.

Amazing work, karagh, the new features look awesome (and also thank you for putting in the extra effort on backward compatibility!). I would also like to place a request to add new templates for the encounter and player side quests being introduced with the The Lost Realm -- those are going to open up a lot of design possibilities, and I'm excited to start experimenting with them!

Hi Kjeld,

 

of course, those cards will be included in the plug-in, along with the Event-Boon card. In fact, I've done most of the work already, but I won't include the card oficialy until the box is released and oficial rules are available, because I need to scan the cards, work the graphics and make sure every needed control and option is included.

Should be done in 1 or 2 weeks. I've finished scripting the cards, but have to work out the graphics. You can download the plugin WIP version here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8Ben9xORvv5dUlRQlZ3ek1YYms&authuser=0 [https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8Ben9xORvv5dUlRQlZ3ek1YYms&authuser=0]

Just wanted to say the new version it's finished, took me more than expected though. Added the Event Boon, Player and Encounter Side Quests, and The One Ring Objective. Maybe something more, but can't remember right now. I've removed the side quest spheres from the previous test version.

 

I'll check more the plugin before uploading to the catalog, but anyone anxious to use the new cards can download the 12th version in the link above.

Hi Guys,

I'm just trying to print some custom cards myself. But what I struggle with is the following:

Is there a way to add additional margin around the card, to account for cut off when the cards are printed?

 

I could do this via Photoshop for normal cards by myself, as they just have a black border.

But when making borderless cards, this is impossible. Is there a way to do this inside Strange Eons?

When exporting cards, there's an option to add a synthetic bleed margin. That's what you need.

It seems you are opening a card created with Strange Eons 2. I'm sending you a private message to find a solution.

 

Edit: on second thought, it seems to me you are using Strange Eons 2 or a very old version of the plugin, which are not maintained and may not work well with latest java. Please, install Strange Eons 3.

I don't know :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]. I've decided to take my time betwen big updates.

 

It takes a good amount of time to prepare new templates, programing the plugin and testing (both new cards and that old cards still work as expected). Updating 4 or 5 times per year was just too much. To the point that I stoped working on my own custom quests.

 

So, I've decided to update the plugin at the end of each cycle, once all the variants of the new cards are released. That will take less total time, because I can get whole picture of what I want to do and plan how to get it done, avoiding undoing some things and redoing them in another way as much as posible.

 

I'm yet to release the plugin update with the sphere variants of the player side quests (that one should come by the end of this month). Then I'll start spending some time with the ship cards' graphics.

Oh, my... the forum system is not sending me emails with the new posts. Sorry for the late response.

No prebuild tag yet (I knew I was missing something when adding these templates...). I will add them as soon as possible.

You can add any image to the text bex with the tag <image  ...>. There is a shortcut in the tags menu. Use "pt" as measure for the image, and get a PNG with transparecy. If not sure how to make the image, tell me.

I haven't see that the one who put LOTR on Strange Eons is here. Great job! It is amazing how easy and beautiful to create cards this way. I really love it.

I have a little suggestion: when we create a new card we select the type of the card. (let say an ally). The one who is presented have only a few text. But I think it would be more interesting to add various effects to it (like a force effect, an action and a response, a reference to his name, to a trait and a keyword) so we have example of typography for the most common effects existing. The ones who want to erase his text to write from scratch a new one can do it very easily but it could help to use existing effects. I actually look at similar cards to the one I create on the web to write it the good way and this would help me a lot.

But may be I'm the only one concerned about making the good work in italic and write the sentence the same way the developer did ^^.

I don't know if I'm clear enough. I can't give you example because I broke my main computer were Strange Eons on the last days. But if you are interested I can reinstall it and make them for you on the next week(s).

You made a good point in that card examples may be too simple. If you make the examples, send me the texts and I'll include them in the next update.

Finally I get back into Strange Eons. So I can (and it may even be easier) make them this way. It is more convenient?

I have Strange Eons in french but all the examples are in english. If I make a french version of each (with french typo who is slightly different) can it be useful too?

Of course, I'll include the translations too. Also, if you find something in the user interface that needs translation too, tell me.

You can send me the texts any way you want: send me the Eons files or send me a message with the texts.

New Update

Added sailing icons and a button for sailing test icon. That's all for now.

Remember that you can configure the context bar to show icon buttons, in Edit > Preferences > Context bar.

More than a month until I found the time to update my plugins. Sad, but lifes hard sometimes. :-p

Anyhow, thanks for the update!

I do get a message on each build-in picture: >>Unable to load image resource "TheLordOfTheRingsLCG/icon/e.g.TheThreeTrials.png"<< So I assume there was some mistake at compiling the package?

Yes, I see I didn't test the last update properly. You will find the update soon.

You'll notice the icon picture loads porperly in the card. You can create the cards safely, because it's just a problem with the user interface.

Testing again, it seems like there's a problem with the plugin installation and a clean update should fix it. Do the following:

 1. Go to Toolbox>Manage Plugins (or press F12)
 2. Select each The Lord of the Rings LCG extensión and uninstall it.
 3. Close Strange Eons
 4. Open Strange Eons
 5. Go to Toolbox>Caralog (or press Shift+F12)
 6. Install The Lord of the Rings LCG HD plugin
 7. Close Strange Eons
 8. Open Strange Eons
 9. Try creating a card

If it works tell me. If someone else got this problem report it here too.

For the hero it was only correction of the typo mistakes and traduction, since big images does not allow a long text.

The idea is to put more abilities so we have, each time we create a new cards, more syntax already here. We can just erase the part that don't fit and change a few words to make the major part of the ability of the game. It is supposed to be read directly in the Strange Eons box of text. It is also difficult to read here because of the low resolution of the images. I post them to be sure that heavykaragh agree about this before doing the others cards.

I continue to make some changes to correct little mistake (as the point at the end of the last trait, define how long the boost last).

They look good enough. For the ally, change the flavour text to a short frase to gain font size, and should be done. For example:

...we almost forgot our grief for a time...
 ---Legolas, The Fellowship of the Ring

Also, Action should be limited to once per phase.

With the Hero, we can change the default template to the non-promotional version.

I'm having trouble because of 2 things that haven't be implemented yet:

1/ There is a limit of 20 progress on main quests. It is possible to extend this to 50?

2/ There is no possibility for creationg stage 2C, 3E or so. It is very usefull for epic mode, or when encounter have his own quest deck (like race across harad).

Ok. Thanks for looking at it. I have done temporary method to do what I want but I will change my quest cards as soon those options are available :).

Have you take a look to the most recent of ally/Hero/attachment? So I know if they are ok for you and I start make another card types.

Yeah, examples are ok. I may shorten some text to make it more legible, once you get the others, send me a PM with them.

The translations are easy to do, once  I finish including new encounter icons and some other stuff in the plugin, I'll contact you through PM to update the translation.

Sure, I could add a text box for the shadow effects, but... you can do that right now! Create a new player card and add this into the rules box:


<b>Action:</b> action effect.
<vs>
<center><sha><i>
<b>Shadow:<b> shadow effect.

A new update is available.

- Reworked fonts: I've updated the font files to get rid of some bugs appearing depending on Java version and operative system installed. If anyone finds missing accents or graphical glitches, please, report it.

- Added Eye of Sauron icons.

- Card sized divider now has template colors based on the box or cycle.

I found a good YouTube tutorial on installation and basic usage, thanks to The Kirkwood Runner: Strange Eons tutorial [https://youtu.be/owf5qNIeZ7A]

I haven't included example cards shown above because to include some new features I'm planning I have to rework a big portion of the code, and that will take a lot of time.

Make a backup of your cards before editing in the new version. If you find anything not working properly, report it.

It seems that updating the plugin trough the catalog may not work as expected. If you find yourself without proper encounter set or collection lists, you have to reinstall the plugin.

Any of you can solve this following these steps:

 1. Open Strange Eons and press F12 (or open the menu Tools>Manage).
 2. On the left list, for each The Lord of the Rings plugin part: select it press the "uninstal" button on the bottom right of the window.
 3. Close the window and Strange Eons.
 4. Open Strange Eons and press Shift+12 (or open the menu Tools>Catalog), and install the plugin.


I've been reported this problem 3 times, but I don't know if this is common or where lies the problem. If any of you have this problem, leave a message here. Writing "update problem" is enough.

@Seastan [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/240509-seastan/] Well, if I put it in Options field then it is still gonna have that frame around it. I can put it at the end of Flavour field and close italic tag before it, but it is still too small, it should be same font size as Rules. As I dont know what tags is Flavour text wrapped in, this method is very difficult to perform.

Best would be to have some kind of switch somewhere to delete that frame and change font, etc. But it is probably possible by knowing tags, that are around Flavour text, too. 

Edit: <b> tag does nothing in Options field

@Seastan [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/240509-seastan/] Thanks, I was still hoping for some kind of switch, but this works well. You just tried 120% size or it is written somwhere?

Oh and is it possible to align Victory to bottom? <bottom> tag aligns whole card to bottom. I can still insert multiple lines above it so it will be at bottom of the card, but there can be better solution.

Hi @Mr_Kew [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/332160-mr_kew/]

I won't add such switch to remove the victory decoration, because I don't want too add marginaly used stuff to the user interface.

But there is a way to do a lot of stuff like this: through the settings. It's not an obvious way and it's not easy. So anyone willing to do this kind of stuff just ask how to.

There is the workaround that will please you:

 * Open Window>Setting explorer
 * Most of the card is defined by "settings". Some settings select which picture to use for the template or the which font to use. Others keep the user values, like the name, collection icon or stats.
 * changing these values will change how the card looks

 

 * This will remove the decoration.
 * In that window, in the Key column, look for VictoryDeco
 * Double click on its Value and change it to: TheLordOfTheRingsLCG/image/empty1x1.png
 * It paints a picture, but is a transparent one
 * Press return to accept the change (the key and value will be shown in white now)

 

 * This will recover the usual font and change the size
 * Look for OptionRight-style in Key column
 * Change value to: FAMILY: {Eons.namedObjects.LRL.BodyFont}; WEIGHT: BOLD; SIZE: 7.0; FOREGROUND: #000000
 * This won't change anything now, but it will show the desired changes when you reload the card. So save your card, close it in the editor and then open it again. 

 

 * Extra: changing placement of the text
 * Look for Location-OptionRight-region in Key column
 * Change value to: 291,464,57,10
 * You can increase or decrease the second value to get the desired vertical placement
 * These numbers describe a box and it's placement: horizontal,vertical, width,height
 * This setting will work right away when changing it

It's not pretty, but it works.

 

Oh, and some alignment tags are boound to the text box: justify, top and bottom can't be activated for different parts of the same text box. Only center, left and right are switchable.

Yes, you have to change for each card. There's no way of applying it a generic way.

Doing otherwise would imply changing cards (for example from other authors) that don't have to change.

Hello,

I have two questions:

 * How to add new font? Included fonts don't support some letters from my language (e.g. ů), can I add some font that supports my language?
 * Is it possible to translate cards somehow? String tables look like its their purpose, but I can't figure out how to use them or find any tutorial. I have cards in one language and I want to make copy translated to english.

Thanks for any answers (links to other places to ask as well), also thanks for your previous answers Settings Explorer is amazing.

Edit:
Component Factory Task [http://basement.cgjennings.ca/Component+Factory+Task] says: "Factories can be useful in many situations. For example, they can be used to automate the translation of content into multiple languages", but I can't find how to use it.

I implemented a custom translation system specific to my plugin. You can read an explanation about it in the Lord of the Rings plugin section of the preferences. It's on the translation section, on the blue exclamation mark. Whenever you save the component, you save all texts in strings marked with the selected "game language" in the plugin preferences. If you change the "game language" you will save all strings in other strings, marked with the new "game language", keeping the previous language strings. You can check this through settings explorer where you will find, for example, "name_en_us" and "name_es_es", if you change "game language". That way you can load into the card the strings for the language that you want to translate from. It's a bit obscure, but if you don't understand how to use it, I'll try to write a tutorial.

About the missing font characters, do you refer to the rules box font too? The character you use as example should work on the rules box. I have updated the card title font with a lot of non-english characters, like the one you show, but I have to upload it to the online repository. I'll try to upload it this week. Adding a font with full Unicode range of characters is one of the things in my to-do list. But I'm not sure how to implement it, so I've been pushing it back.

P.D.: I'm in the middle of a complete rewrite of the plug-in, so new cool features will be added, like OCTGN export and editing cards using data from spreadsheets, but it will take time.

Yes, I understand the translation now, works nicely, so don't worry about the tutorial.

My font problem is with <se> tag in QuestSheet/Rules, as there is a font that supports English only (I guess). I was thinking about adding new font to my Strange Eons and using it by <family font> instead of <se>. But as I have no idea how to do it, so I'm happy to see that you are gonna fix it within a few weeks.

Anyway, thanks for this amazing plugin, it seems you have implemented every feature I can think of, and thanks for your precise and helpful answers to my questions.

Oh and my friend agreed to translate the plugin into Czech (cs_CZ) language (we are Czech), but as not everything is currently officially translated, we're thinking about leaving the rest of Encounter Sets in English for now and translate only those, that are already available in Czech, to prevent confusion. Interface would be fully translated.

Is it ok to only translate files: LRL-interface.properties, LRL-icons.properties, LRL-game.properties? And I would send them to you afterwards.

Sure, go for it.

I've checked the font you mention, and that is halfway through the character expansion. If you find any other character missing from the special fonts, tell me so I create all of them.

Well, font don't have these characters from Czech: ě š č ř ž ů

Thanks a lot, font is working now. However there are few issues: interpunction above E has sometimes strange offset and plugin can't find any of encounter set icons (at least in my version).

I have also attached part of Czech translation, interface is slightly delayed.

The punctuation offset is intentional, I thought it looked cool, but now I see that is inconsistent with other characters. I'll correct it and put all accents centered.

 

For the icons (yes, I have to update with latest ones). Uninstall the icons part of the plug-in in the manager (F12), close and launch again strange eons, and install it again through the catalog (shift+F12). This error happens sometimes to some users but I can't find where's the problem.

In my case the problem was that the icons part wasn't there at all. Solved by reinstalling plug-in.

Translation is finally ready, I have attached translated files. There might be some issues with encoding. Also please take a look at that font, that offset looks weird.

Does anyone have the ability/willingness/time to create a plugin for playing card? Create your own suits with their own colors type of thing...

I am currently fixing my cards with errata and from translation errors. One of the cards that needs reworking is the campaign card for Passage of the Marshes, as the bit about changing heroes is missing. I do not bother scanning the image on the card and inserting it into the errataed copy, because I intend to just print the lower half and stick it into the sleeve with the original.

Now the campaign text is instructing me to remove burdens with the Helm's Deep and Road to Isengard icons but I cannot find a way to include the icons in the text.

Insert image into text using Markup->Image...

Paths to icons are: "res://TheLordOfTheRingsLCG/icon/TheRoadToIsengard.png" and "res://TheLordOfTheRingsLCG/icon/HelmsDeep.png"

It refers to Strange Eons's resources, where are stored all the plugins files, such as icons, scripts, card scans, etc.

You can read more about image paths and other stuff at Miriam's Basement [http://basement.cgjennings.ca/Table+of+Markup+Tags].

Thanks for your help. The first time I tried the path, it did not work, I only got a red cross. Now it worked, though I am not quite happy with the result. Is there a way to include the black ring around the encounter icons like in the original card?

Well, the black ring is at "res://TheLordOfTheRingsLCG/image/EncounterDeco.png", but I don't know how to put two images on top of each other. I see few options:

1) Get all three images from resources and combine them in some graphic editor
2) Somehow use JavaScript to overlap images directly in Strange Eons (but I can't use js, so I don't know if this is even possible)
3) Create Scenario card, change its settings to make it look like a Campaign card, then place EncounterDeco into not used Encounter set icon and move it around again using settings.

Those are just my possible workaround, maybe there are some easier ways implemented by @HeavyKaragh [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/176909-heavykaragh/]

Sorry, I'm not checking the forum much lately.

I can tell you how to add the ring picture, but combining both images in the editor may be too tricky.

It may be better to use a image editor to combine both externally as you put it option 1, and add it the way you know.

I ended up using an image editor and combined both, though I somehow overwrote my save file after printing it. Thanks for your help, guys.
