i was playing escape from dol guldur last night for the first time, and it was time to bring out the nazgul of dol guldur. in the 2nd forced it says to discard a character. does that mean that character is dead, or just out of play? i played it as dead, which would mean it is very important to get alot of ally cards in play before you even start to get to him. rough very rough.

You have to take one character you control, meaning it has to be in play, and send it to the discard. So, I guess that would mean out of play. At the moment, it also means somewhat "dead" (since I haven't seen any effects which put a card completely out of the game). And with the right cards any character can be brought back from the discard
