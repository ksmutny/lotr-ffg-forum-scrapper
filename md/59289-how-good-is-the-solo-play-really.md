 Hi all,

I'm considering buying this game atm. I havent tried any of the other LCGs before, but like the idea that you dont have to spend alot of money into buying random boosters. (I previously enjoyed both the Pokemon TCG (good times)  and Magic).

I'm planning to play a lot of solitaire playthroughs and have been reading a lot of mixed opinions on it.
Many seem to think that's its actually too hard, and it's basically only the beginner scenario thats playabale and enjoyable. The other two are simply too frustrating to enjoy.

Is this really the case? I think it's a shame if only 1/3 scenarios are meant for 1 player.
Btw I might get a chapter pack from the beginning, but if the game basically needs a chapter pack to enjoy solo play, then I think it kinda defeats the concept of the LCG format.

In another note, have all the expansions and chapter packs kept focus on both solo and coop, or do they favor the latter?

Last question: In general, is the game repititive or is there a lot of variations due to the many different encounter cards and so on?

I am sure there are others that can put it better than i can but i would have to say the solo play is amazing. I have played about 20 games solo...of the 20 i have played, i have only played 3 different quests...each game was totally different. Despite knowing the quests ahead of time (what you have to accomplish) the random draw of encounter cards and your player deck really makes each game different.

LCG in my opinion doesn't change the game play itself. LCG effects how you get new cards (everyone has access to adventure packs and everyone gets the same card in each pack as the next guy). Unlike magic, where you have to keep buying to get the card you really are looking for, you buy the APs and you get the cards. Simple enough.

for me, solo play is the best. However, the fact that you can play two player by just controlling both sets of hero's makes it that much more flexible.

As far as the difficulty, it depends on the quest. There are a few that are so hard solo (1 set of Hero's). But, as a single player, you have the option of tackling a quest controlling both players hands (6 hero's).

Just my thoughts.

This game is very good in multiplayer; not doubt, but, in my opinion, it shines the most when playing solo.

 

Whether you play it using the core rules with 1 or 2 decks or if you use the unofficial  5-Heroes rule, you'll see how fun this game really is.

Every single time I open my box, I play through all scenarios; Passage through Mirkwood (first scenario) is easy, but is a good way to introduce the game. Even if you play it after beating every other scenario you'll still find it refreshing. You build a deck, you try to beat every stage so far, and when you try the Passage through Mirkwood again, it is still a good run.

 

I'm sure I'm not alone in this feeling, but you must play to know what I'm talking about. The Hunt for Gollum (the first Adventure Pack) is also very interesting because you feel really progressing through the story of the game. 

Every pack afterwards, you will feel more immersed in Tolkien's world.

 

To tell you the truth, I'm not a hardcore fan, but this game made me buy the books just to feel even more 'in there' with the heroes.

hi

firstly ive played only solo for since the games release in april last year

have played countless games and enjoyed them all. i have all cards released to date and they are all playable AND winnable solo, some easier than others...i would say there is only 1 quest so far that isnt really solo friendly and that is in the core set..im not sure where you got that theres only 1 quest soloable but......mmmm.. sounds like players who tryed for a week or two then gave up.....there was alot who did this at the start,,,i tryed for months to get just 1 quest....it drove me mad...but i loved it gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]

it is true it is hard to begin with, but like anything else you have to practice to get it, so expect to lose alot...if this bothers you this game may not be for you

if however you like a challenge and a puzzle on what deck and combos to use i would recommend this game

if your like me and a tolkien nut you will adore this games theme

the quest packs to date - 6 and 1 deluxe have all held true to the solo promise

this game is worth every penny and its a rare gem for a tolkien- card game fan that doesnt want/doesnt have game friends

the game isnt repetative at all in my opinion....sitting here i have the game infront of me and have been making a deck/playing a quest for 2hrs now...i play at least 1 every couple of days and spend my life on this forum and have posted over 600 messages since april--im not sad....honest....i have a girlfriend...

all together - i would defend this game till death....i see no reason for a soloer not to be happy if they put in the required few months of practice to get the rules/gist of the game etc, i apologise if my reply is a little obsessive....but as you can tell im passionate about this game.

I guess it can't hurt to have a different opinion in here, so I'll chime in. To me, this game is primarily a 2-player game. I played  95% of my games together with my girlfriend. Playing it solo is sort of fun, but it always seems like a substitute of a 2-player game to me. The communication between the players, the discussion of different plans and approaches, throwing out ideas how to best handle the situation is what makes me enjoy the game the most. And my girlfriend feels even stronger about it than me, she would never even touch the game if she were to play alone.

The difficulty scaling isn't done too well. It seems most quests were designed to optimally play with 2. With more, they usually become easier, and alone they are usually harder. The last quest in the core set is absolutely brutal and nigh-impossible for solo play (I did actually win it once, but it was with superhuman luck). Of the expansion packs, only the last one (Return to Mirkwood) also has a similar problem with balancing, the others are better.

The games play out rather differently, depending on the draw of the encounter deck and your own player deck. It will feel a bit random at times, and you will lose a few games to unlucky draws where you really have no chance at all. The different quests usually play rather differently, especially the ones in the Core Set. A lot of creativity went in there.

So yeah, it's a good game with several issues (bad scaling, lots of unclear rules in details, strong dependence on the draw). Artwork and theme are as good as it gets for such a game. But at least to me, it's mostly a 2-player game.

I completely agree with everything said by Trantor.

Solo is fun, but the game is designed for 2 players. You can see this in the quests in almost every scenario.Now I am not saying that solo play is bad, in fact I think it is one of the better solitaire games that I know of. Though I think that the co-op play is leaps and bounds more fun, the interplay between your friends, as you make your plans, the more complex card interactions, the much more uncontrollable encounter deck.. everything is just better imo.

Still, I think solo play is good enough to warrant a purchase. It is still very challenging and fun solo, though the complexity of the rules means that you will often be playing completely wrong for much of the time when you start out, in 2+ player games you can kind of "check" each other.. but in solo it is easy to forget something or just have a rule wrong.

I enjoy the game a lot in solo play, but I've had a lot more luck in some quests than others.

Here's my very basic take on how each of the quests from the core and first set of boosters works for solo play:

(BIG CAVEAT! I generally have three or four player decks waiting on hand and I don't tailor my decks for specific quests so I don't play in the most optomized fashion.)

 

Passage Through Mirkwood- Like all of the core set quests, this one is more challenging in solo play than in multiplayer, but still usually win-able, even by a novice. Since there are two possible end stages, it provides an extra degree of uncertainty that can help make it fun to revisit. I still use it from time to time to try out new deck concepts and have frequently found myself surprised to have a more challenging game than I had anticipated.

 

Journey Along the Anduin- Again, this one is a lot more challenging in solo play and a lot of players have reported serious difficulty with it. I had lots of success against it the first few times I played, but then lost against it just yesterday when trying out some new decks. It's definitely a challenge, but certainly do-able. The rules allow you to take a single mulligan with your opening hand, consider doing just that if you don't draw a "Feint" or "Forest Snare" or something that can help you deal with that Hill Troll. I've found that if you can quickly and efficiently deal with the troll, then the rest of the quest tends to go pretty smoothly.

 

Escape From Dol Guldur- I reluctantly admit that I've never even attempted to play solo. I've *heard* of it being beaten solo, but I'm pretty sure that wasn't with just a copy of the sore set.

 

The Hunt for Gollum- Very playable in solo. I'd say generally easier than Journey Along the Anduin, but can still provide some challenge.

 

Conflict at the Carrock- *I've* never beaten it solo, but I've also heard from others who have. I suspect this one is a lot easier if you tailor a deck towards defeating it.

 

A Journey to Rhosgobel- This one is also very challenging. Not *as* hard in solo play as Escape from Dol Guldur, but still pretty darn difficult. Make sure you have a way to heal Wilyador besides getting Aethelas and a way to cancel treachery cards. I need to try it again with a tailored deck.

 

The Hills of Emyn Muil- The first time I tried this quest it was solo with a Spirit/Rohan deck (nearly a redundant phrase) and it absolutely destroyed the quest. Easiest game of LotR I'd ever played. It's been a more interesting challenge with other decks. This isn't a very popular quest and it's easy to understand why. I do find this one, in particular, more enjoyable in solo than in multiplayer as it tends to get especially tiresome as multiplayer makes more and more locations come into play.

 

The Dead Marshes- This is a pretty good quest (although, I suggest just giving up and starting over if Gollum ever ends up buried in your discard pile) and one I've enjoyed a lot in both solo game and multiplayer. I won pretty handily in my first solo game with a mostly Spirit deck and had a very nail-biting narrow victory my second time with a mostly Lore deck.

 

Return to Mirkwood- This is a very challenging quest for solo play, although in some ways it gets a bit balanced as there are negative affects that won't come into play since you're the only player guarding Gollum. Two things: Your Threat will go up a minimum of four every turn! And the third stage won't let you play any cards from your hand, so try to get a lot on the table before you get to it. I lost quickly on my first solo play, in large part due to drawing a Hill Troll right away (I was at nearly 40 threat by the end of the second turn). The second time, I came within just a couple progress tokens of victory; I was so very close...then I drew that dang Hill Troll again, alongside everything else that was out at the time, I was overwhelmed and lost. The main solo player on the Cardboard of the Rings podcast rated this one a solid "rage quit", but with the right deck, careful playing, and a bit of luck, it certainly can be done.

 

I don't have Massing at Osgillioth or Khazad-Dum.

 

I love the customization and variability (and the theme) of this game. I rarely play computer/video games, I tend to tire of the quickly, but the LotR card game keeps bringing me back, both for multiplayer and solo games.

very true....you need some good patience when you get your first win...then you find out that you played 7 things wrong completely voiding it!

I play solo almost 100% of the time and this is really the only game that I enjoy playing solo.  All of the scenarios so far have been very different and the more difficult ones are winnable, but require some thought around how to construct your deck and what strategy to employ.  I actually prefer the harder ones, as I like a good challenge and it's a fun puzzle trying to figure out how to consistently beat each scenario.  I find it disappointing when I beat some of the easier ones first try (e.g. Hills of Emyn Muil).  A sign of a fun and good game in my opinion is one when the next day at random times I find myself thinking of a new strategy or deck change to try on a scenario.  As others have said, the artwork on the cards is top notch.

There has been a lot of discussion over whether more player cards should be included in the Adventure Packs, at the expense of scenario encounter cards.  I think the current approach is perfect, with the emphasis on new, unique scenarios and lots of new encounter cards.  To me, what makes the game shine is the different scenarios and lots of different encounter cards which give a unique theme to each new scenario.  Once I can consistently beat a scenario I do tend to lose some interest in it, but with a new scenario released every month the game stays fresh.  The cost is about $15 per new adventure pack, which is just more than going to a movie costs (as a comparison) and I get at least 10 hours of enjoyment from each one so it I consider it a reasonable price.

The few games I've played with 2 players have been fun as well due to the player interaction and joint problem solving.  And as others have said some of the encounter and player card effects are only designed for more than 1 player so you get to try some more varied things.  However, I actually prefer solo as it is a harder challenge and more rewarding when I win.  I also like the art of constructing a deck designed to beat a scenario solo - with more players you don't really need to focus so much on building specfic decks for each scenario.

To put some context around my feedback, I have never played deck building games prior to this other than a few games of Dominion.  I expect I would probably like others given my experience with this one, but did not go into this game as a hard core deck builder.

All of these points are very useful! I find myself somewhere in the middle on your question as well.  I play mainly solo and I have to say that though the scaling does sometimes get on my nerves, I love the game completely and it is a great challenge.  I find the game overall slightly (or perhaps significantly depending on the scenario) easier in multi-play, but, as booooored said (and everyone else here it seems), the game is definitely worth purchasing for strictly solo use.  If you are generally a J.R.R. Tolkien fan, which I suspect you are, you will love every minute of this game...hahaha, except for the times that the encounter deck beats you down horribly and you cry, haha, ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] Hope you join us!

excellent point! if a particular quest has been bothering me for a while i cant stop planning till i beat it

oh yes and i would like to add that even though ive said before that the rules are complex to grasp at first this forum is extremely helpful not to mention ACTIVE....i mean look how many replies there are to this thread in a few hours...granted 3/4 were mine

 Thanks for all your opinions guys, much appreciated.  I think I'll give it a whirl.
Just thought of a couple of questions more.

If I want to play a 2-player game, do I "need" a second core set, or is one sufficient? (I don't plan in any way to participate in tournaments and I doubt there even is some in Denmark)

I think I'll buy an adventure pack from the start, which one do you guys recommend? And is it fine to buy a core set and an adventure pack, or is it better to buy 2 core sets (hope not)?

What about the Khazad-dum expansion? 

Do you miss a lot of "story" if you skip an adventure pack in favor of the next in the cycle?
 

That was a lot of quesitons, but I'm just trying to get an overview of the LCG format :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

1.no i dont think you need a 2nd one

2.buy the packs...you dont need a 2nd core set, at least not until you decdide you want copies of rares etcc. id recommend going from the start - hunt for gollum, its a nice mid-level quest with plenty to do

3.khazad dum is great but difficult, especially with a limited card pool. maybe leave that till youve played for a while

4.depends how much you pay attention to the theme, they all follow a story but dont rely on knowledge of that story to play it. personally i like to follow the storyline closely but as said you dont have to and to alot of people it wouldnt take anything away from the game if you didnt

You don't need a second Core Set for 2 players play, but don't rule it out either. You'll see for yourself how addictive this game can become. It took me 48 h before deciding I needed that 2nd Core Set. Not so much for all the 1-of, but mostly for all the 2-of that you want to have 3 copies of. And another week later, I went for that 3rd Core Set (at the time, I needed that 3rd Celebrian's Stone as well as Unexpected Courage).

As for an adventure pack, it's true that Khazad-Dûm is "harder" (expecially if your card pool is limited), but it provides you with more cards and more quests. As well, it'll be necessary to own it if you want to play any of the next wave of AP, so you should consider it.

As for the other existing AP, I'd suggest you wait until you've played a few games. Especialy if you don't expect to buy them all, you may want to play a few games first and consider which sphere you prefer. You could then purchase the AP providing you with the best player cards suited for your preference.

In terms of quest quality, there are other posts elsewhere on this forum ranking them. Most people agree that Hills of Emyn Muil is boring and Return to Mirkwood is very hard when playing solo. Any of the others would work fine. I'd recommend Conflict at the Carrock. It's very different from the 3 Core Set adventures and provide a good challenge (although once you know how to play around it, it becomes easy).

even though it is a deluxe expansion, i still believe you would benefit from having some earlier cycle cards before buying this....it will just be too difficult, epsecially for a new comer to the game- one of the biggest complaints from beginners is how easy it is to be over ran- well khazad makes a long time player feel like that all over again, so i cant imagine what itd be like going from core set to this

also when thinking of packs look on cardgamedb and see which player cards interest you in each pack, as this another aspect that may sway you in one direction or another

 There are also so some absolutely key cards in the first AP, such as the Songs (that grant various resource icons to your heroes), which in my view are absolutely necessary for most solo play.

You need all the songs + the song fetch card for sure... also the duadain buff cards are in there, map maker... and more.. I think the Mirkwood Cycle is a must get

to the OP- in case you havnt read into it yet, SONG cards allow your heros to gain specific spheres depending on what song they are....the 4 main song cards are 1 for each sphere. they are very useful in building multisphere decks, so this is why so much emphasis is being put in thier purchase....not that you HAVE to have them, but they are sort of key

 I play 1,2,3,and 4 player games all without ever having gotten a second core set, it's only necessary if you feel that you *must* have your decks as kidded out as possible. (Multiple decks with three copies of Gandalf in each, etc.)

 

For the Mirkwood cycle of expansions, I'd say that half of them felt like they were important for the "story".

The Hunt for Gollum is about trying to track the little bugger.

The Dead Marshes is about running him to ground.

Return to Mirkwood is about keeping him captive and trying to bring him back (alive) to King Thranduil.

The rest feel more like side quests that have little if anything to do with the larger narrative.

Conflict at Carrock is about fighting some Trolls and Journey to Rhosgobel is about keeping an eagle from dying. They are two very difficult, but solid quests and are very popular. Part of their popularity may even have to do with feeling like they're their own story and not just part of a larger one.

The Hills of Emyn Muil is ostensibly about getting back on Gollum's trail, but while Hunt for Gollum had you searching for clues relating to his trail, Hills of Emyn Muil is just going to a bunch of locations without much of a narrative framework.

 

Even so, I have a hard time saying which ones are the best to skip as they all have useful cards that often relate to cards from other packs. For instance, the four main "Song" cards are sprinkled throughout the packs and I think each one had one or two Rohan cards and one or two Eagle cards. If you're interested in decks built around either of those, it could behoove you to get all or most of them. Also, if you get Khazad-Dum and want to make some Dwarf decks then you should *seriously* consider picking up Return to Mirkwood for the Dain Ironfoot hero. 

There are lists of all the contents for each pack online: http://lotrlcg.com/ [http://lotrlcg.com/]

Also there are in-depth reviews of each up on Amazon.

 

Have fun!

 Thanks again for all your replies. It certainly is an active forum considering it's "just" a card game. Awesome :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I'll stick to a single core set and perhaps an AP pack or 2 to begin with :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] Thinking of the Rhosgobel one, as I kinda like the premise of the wounded eagle, even though people think its diffiicult.

i like your emphasis on 'just' sorpresa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sorpresa.gif] haha

i think thats sounds like a good plan....actually many of the key cards for success are in the core set anyways....based around peeking at the encounter deck and healing, so that could be a good choice. plus you get haldir and radagast which are both awesome
