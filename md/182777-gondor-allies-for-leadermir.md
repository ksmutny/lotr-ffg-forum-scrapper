# [Gondor Allies for Leadermir](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/182777-gondor-allies-for-leadermir/)

Since there was a Beorning Ally thread made, I thought I'd throw in my ideas for strengthening Leadership Boromir.

(I may have done this already a while ago... But that's okay)

 

#1

Leadership Ally:  White Tower Knight

Cost: 4

Willpower: 1

Attack: 2

Defense: 2

HP: 3

Traits: Gondor. Knight. Warrior.

Text:  Sentinel.  Response: After an enemy attack resolves that White Tower Knight defended against, add one resource to a Gondor hero's resource pool.

 

#2

Tactics Ally:  White Tower Soldier

Cost: 2

Willpower: 1

Attack: 2

Defense: 0

HP: 2

Traits: Gondor. Soldier.

Text: If White Tower Soldier has 3 or more Attack, he gains +2 Defense.

 

Just some ideas, but I think it would help Leadermir be a much more viable hero.

I think they are both good, but the first one maybe should be: "After an enemy attack resolves that White Tower Knight defended against that is not engaged with you, add one resource to a Gondor hero's resource pool."

for the second one, +1 cost. also Cannot have attachments. that will make the ONLY time it works with leadership Boromir.  otherwise, he could be busted by other attachments.  +1 cost cause otherwise he would be to OP, and he would be used in any tactics deck.  he would be like ax hand, who is already a decent ally, but +1 wp and -1 defence + HIS EFFECT.

Do you think there is not enough already? We have:

 

Envoy of Pelargir

 

Guard of the Citadel

 

Pelargir Ship Captain

 

That's 3x3 allies for you that may be player exclusively with Leadership, are in range of 2 resources and all grow to 2 willpower and 2 attack with the right treatment. And there is plenty of other, in and out of the sphere, not to mention this spoiled guy:

In a deck with Leadership Borormir, this Veteran of Osgiliath will be good even before the 40 threat. Imagine him being 3/4/1/2 at 40+.

Indeed, while OP's ideas are amazing and very powerful, I'm extremely excited to play the Veteran of Osgiliath. A heavy attacker is in my opinion exactly what mono leadership Gondor needed (now that it has a heavy quester with Ingold). These two allies will really help the deck so that it doesn't rely too much on weenies. I'm extremely excited for all the new support leadership Gondor will get this cycle, from these two allies to the Reinforcements to the mysterious leadership weapon announced for the last pack.

I have been saying for a while, Leadership Boromir is excellent. Of course, he is a very different to his Tactics version, not as much outright potential one could argue but even though his "special ability" is only for attack, it is a very good one. And a reason for it being so good is Gondor already have quite a few Gondor allies. That said, I would really welcome more, so hail to this thread, of course, but Leadership Boromir can really shine already: turning those useful allies like Errand-rider or Squire of the Citadel into potential attackers when you don't need them for something else. Having played mono-Leadership with Boromir a lot, I can say this ability has saved me a lot of trouble, especially when I needed to get rid of an enemy early, and that one or two extra attack made the difference.

 

I have been playing Veteran Osgiliath since he had been first previewed. He is obviously excellent.

 

I like the suggestions above very much because they seem to try to solve one problem mono-Leadership is struggling with: the lack of defence. I would like to see some Leadership Gondor defensive allies (that Boromir can turn into decent attackers as well).

Yeah. I'm not the best deck builder, and I generally tend to stick to theme more than power, so I just haven't been able to get too much use out of Leadermir.  But I'm sure there are great ways to make him work out there. My biggest problem is that I never leave that one resource in his pool. I always spend it. Haha.  But thanks for the suggestions!

I also really like the Herald from the Ring maker cycle for leadership Boromir. Ingold and the Veteran are going to be amazing for the Gondor trait.

Herald of Anórien is very good, my favortie of the doomed allies in fact. He is 2 weenies for the price of 1 basically, which is obviously excellent. You can even play out of sphere allies with him like Warden of Healing or even a unique like Arwen or Gléowine, which in monoleadership can be invaluable.

Yes. In a mono-Leadership, Herald can bring Warden of Guard to add some much needed healing/damage cancelation. Or Arwen, indeed, if you want the Elven lady on your team, haha, who wouldn't, right?

 

I think the underwhelming consensus (that I feel exists among the players) about Leadership Boromir is due to two factors: 1) Tactics Boromir can do a lot, and fits into many a deck, 2) some want heroes to be more versatile.

 

Then again, people admire Éomer for being a great attack, for instance. I think Leadership Boromir is in general a much more efficient attacker. Of course, sometimes you need one big source of attack strength but more often, especially in high-threat decks, you need to spread the strength. For that Boromir is great. I always pair him up with Imrahil, and they can take care of numerous foes from round 1.

 

Additionally, Visionary Leadership or Heir of Mardil are just made for Leadership Boromir. And Boromir is really just the former attachment away from being the Dain for Gondor. And I would say keeping the resource is easier than keeping ready, plus Gondor has many more allies than Dwarves.

 

Sometimes I wish Boromir could be a better defender, though. He can easily get to willpower two or three in mono-Leadership, and then Heir of Mardil is really worth it to use him for both questing and attack. But the defence is hard to boost unless you add Tactics (the Shield). I have always found For Gondor! not very efficient, I have been trying it since the core set and it never stayed long in my decks.

Oh, the weapon, yes, how I hope it be really good. How I like to play as the so called doomed armies of Gondor. Boromir's approach reminds me that of Feanor in the Simlarillion: going against the odds. As a reader, you know it is not going to happen but you cheer for them nonetheless (well, not for Feanor always, or some of the Sons, but the Noldor… and Gondor in latter years).

 

And I really enjoy recreating that feeling in the game: where I can actually win. I would never play Outlands again because then it may feel very easy to win. The Gondor however, seems weak in a way but can unite in a mighty struggle. And I have a very soft spot for the hounted, tragic characters, like Boromir.
