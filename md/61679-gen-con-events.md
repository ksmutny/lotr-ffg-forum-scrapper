 Is there a listing of the events that FFG is holding at Gen Con for LoTR?  Are there going to be tournaments?  Anyone know?

 I'm hoping they'll at least have another special print-on-demand Quest again, like Massing at Osigiliath last year. Can never have too many Quests. ^_^ [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_happy.png]

This would surprise me if it happens. As there is (as far as we know) no events.. so no custom quest, so no print on demand of a custom quest...
