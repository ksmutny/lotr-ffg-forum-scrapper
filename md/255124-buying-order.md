so basically i usually only buy sets on ebay or amazon just because it is a lot cheaper, but i'm unsure whether its a good idea to not buy the saga quests in order.  currently the flame of the west is significantly cheaper than any other sagas (btw i only own black riders).  Should i just buy and play flame of the west, or just wait?  the road darkens is currently ridiculously expensive.

The Road Darkens is currently cheap on Book Depository. I picked it up last week for $27 Australian dollars inc. shipping (about $21 US dollars)

Edit: To answer your question about buying order, if I see a cheap expansion I grab it straight away. You never know when it will go out of print. I actually bought The Road Darkens before The Black Riders, which at the time was out of stock on Book Depository (it has since come back in stock). However I always play scenarios in the order in which they were released.

Agreed. If you are sure to keep playing the game, grap a good deal if you see one (you could even just wait to play it until you have the rest). You only loose the campaign option by buying/playing the sagas out of order.

yeah your right book depository is a lot cheap.  The one thing, idk if youd know this but how much would shipping be to the us?  Where does the company ship from?

also how reliable is the site?  all the sets are really really cheap, but i just wanna make sure im buy sets and not throwing away money.  are they just getting rid of their lotr lcg stock or something?  lol you might not know all the answers to those qs, sorry for asking so many.

I've gotten things from book depository through amazon before and they arrived just fine.  Lots of people use them, so you shouldn't have issues.

If you are in the US, I have used CoolStuffInc  to order Lord of the Rings  for times when Amazon doesn't have something.

They have The Road Darkens for $25 plus shipping.  They seem to have most of the Saga in stock except for The Black Riders.

They are UK based and have free worldwide shipping, I believe. They ship to Australia and New Zealand for free, at least. I have found them to be reliable. They are the one of the preferred ways to purchase LoTR expansions in this part of the world (Australia) since their prices are the best (for us). The only thing to watch out for is that they sometimes show the English cover art for Spanish LoTR expansions, so check the language. A lot of people got caught out and bought Spanish Khazad Dum by mistake.

I am of the impression that they are a warehouse of sorts, and probably purchase in bulk lots when stock is available. So their stock comes and goes. But I have purchased 2 expansions and  a full cycle from them (with 2 more expansions on the boat) and not yet had a problem.

But if you are in the US then you have more purchasing options than people elsewhere in the world, for whom shipping costs are often prohibitive, so you might find better prices domestically.

I've bought from book depository maybe ~50 times. About a dozen of those were LOTR LCG packs. 

Overall they are very reliable. Shipping isn't fast (2-ish weeks usually) but it's free. I've had two items not show up in the delivery window, and in both cases they've immediately offered a refund, no hassles (one showed up two days late, and for the other I took the refund). 

There have been two times where I've ordered an item and then they've said a day later that it's no longer in stock, I'm guessing because multiple people have ordered at once. In both cases my refund was processed in less than 24 hours. 

TL:DR- they are safe and reliable to order from.
