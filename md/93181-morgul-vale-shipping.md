I expect people in the States have this early next week. We know the hero, a Leadership attachment, a Spirit attachment, a Lore attachment, but there are still probably six more cards to be spoilt. I am hoping for at least two allies, and especially some Gondor synergy.

It is funny but most people on forum care a lot about players cards in AP. But for me is most important is encounter and quest deck. If quest is not good doesn't really matter how good a player cards since game is boring.

That fact is really wondering me.... only me and maybe another couple of players have this kind of vision...

I'm the same! Sure, I won't turn down a good player card or two, but I'm far more interested in the quest. For me, the APs are like full game expansions rather than the more traditional card game boosters, and I love seeing the new stuff we're given to overcome each month  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Yet you point this out just about every time. Maybe it would be easier to accept not everyone is the same, there is nothing funny about it actually, it is natural. The fact you are in a minority makes you neither better nor worse.

For me, since I really like the quests in this cycle, much more than the previous, I am also really looking forward to have a new quest. But I do not see any point knowing the encounter cards before having them. Whilst knowing the player cards allows me to look for new strategies in deck-building.

I usually look for player cards first.

 

Both are important, but a quest is self-contained.  I will not usually play a quest multiple times in a row just for fun (I'll cycle around and get back to it later), and player cards are generally useable in any quest, so I'm more interested in the deck-building options provided by the player cards.  Ultimately, though, the quest needs to be good because there really aren't enough of them to support many throw-aways.  Each weak quest entry hurts the game more than a weak player card set.

 

The way I see it, the more player cards we have, the more options and the more variety we will see in the gameplay.  Each new set opens up new possibilities for playing any quest.
