That quote on the newly-spoiled spirit event is absolutely perfect for its card!  Well done, FFG!

It begs the question, though.  Did the line from the book inspire the card idea, or did someone just happen to find that perfect quote for this card?

As a card designer for another card game, I sometimes design cards around the quotes, and sometimes I just find a great quote after the card is designed.  Which one was it this time?  Any fans care to guess?  Would the designer care to share?

i assume that the designers took a long look at the return of the king whilst getting initial ideas for these cards, and then noted any key quotes and phrases and then went from there

at least thats how id do it- as i see it, its easier to design a card round a qoute than to find a quote to fit a card
