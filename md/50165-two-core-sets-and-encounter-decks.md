Hi there all, I just got a second copy of the Core Set so I could build more competitive decks for the game and it got me wondering about the encounter decks. Should I use both Core Sets to build the encounter decks since there will be the exact same chance of getting a card out?

For example, if for the encounter forest deck I had 2 of a card, now I have 4 and double the cards. Does it make sense?

Thanks,

Javier

No, the encounter decks are designed to be used as they are in ONE core set.

 

What a lot of people with multiple core sets do is use the second set to put together a "permament" encounter deck for the 2nd or 3rd quest so they don't have to pull the first one apart.

Thanks for the help! Will probably do that =)
