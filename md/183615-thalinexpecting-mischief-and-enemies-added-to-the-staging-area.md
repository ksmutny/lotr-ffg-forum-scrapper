If a card instructs you to search the encounter deck and add it to the staging but omits the word reveal I assume Thalin's and Expecting Mischief's abilities would not affect the enemy, correct?

 

Thalin

 

> While Thalin is committed to a quest, deal 1 damage to each enemy as it is revealed by the encounter deck.

 

Expecting MIschief

 

> Play during the quest phase, before the staging step.
> Action: Deal 2 damage to the first enemy revealed from the encounter deck this phase.

Exactly, it has to be "revealed"
