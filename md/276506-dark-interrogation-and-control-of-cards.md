Foolishly, I am attempting solo Escape from Dol Guldur Nightmare. A question on Dark Interrogation's shadow text: "Shadow: Discard each card you control that has at least 1 copy of itself in your discard pile...".

When I look at the online rules - mec01_online_only_rules_reference_for_website.pdf [https://images-cdn.fantasyflightgames.com/filer_public/90/19/90191e4e-a341-4379-b398-5963b7a87ebf/mec01_online_only_rules_reference_for_website.pdf] - under Ownership and Control, it states:

"By default, cards enter play under their owner’s control" and

"A player controls the cards in his or her out-of-play game areas (such as the hand, the deck, and the discard pile)"

So do I have to discard any card in play (under my control), AND in my hand AND in my deck that matches any in my discard pile? I know it is Nightmare, but that seems, well, nightmarish.

Huh. I don't think that was the original intention, but I think you're right about the rules-as-written interpretation there. Seems pretty clear that you do indeed control the cards in your hand and deck.

Possibly a candidate for errata?

No, just a cornercase loophole that often happens when this game's rules are taken as written.

No, you don't need to discard them. I agree you control them, but control is not enough. 

From the rules:: Card effects do not interact with cards in an out of play state unless the effect specifically refers to that state.

Since Dark Interrogation doesn't specifically refer to cards out of play, it gets the default behavior of affecting only cards in play and does not the rest, regardless of control. Your hand is safe (as is your deck and victory display, etc)

Thanks Richard - that makes a lot of sense, and restores the balance!
