this was possibly one the most fun (and short) games ive played yet.....didnt expect to get this far, seeing as i drew NO threat reduction cards...and had +4 threat every turn

 

Frodo/Eowyn/Dunhere

All spirit cards- willpower/travel based

 

got past 1b 2b pretty easily, no nasty encounters, just bats which went quickly. then i finished 3b, and only had wargs in play...so getting exited i put my forces to work to clear the area allowing me to win with 2 progress tokens next turn. i had only dunhere ready, so i left the attack undefended, the wargs got a shadow card without effect, so gollum got 3 hits and it went back to staging...however....dunhere now could attack getting +1 that he wouldnt have got if it had an effective shadow card.previously. so 2 hit points- 1 left....

 

started the turn with a threat of 48....it was now or never....only wargs in and 1 location in staging area...lorien guide commited getting rid of it with 1 progress token, and eowyn followed....and what did i draw...A HILL TROLL.

 

wonderful. anyways questing easily got 2 progress tokens on the quest card, but faced with 1 turn to defend and attack against a hill troll it was game over
