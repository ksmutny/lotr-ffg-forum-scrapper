Does anyone here build decks larger than 50 cards? I know that less cards = more consistency, but I also know that sometimes people get bored with decks that are too consistent. I've seen people mention they only put in two copies of some cards to combat that, but....some math.

 

3 copies in a 50 card deck: 6% chance to pull

2 copies in a 50 card deck: 4% chance to pull

 

3 copies in a 60 card deck: 5% chance to pull.

 

It seems like a good half way point....as long as there's not that one card you REALLY need that extra % to get a hold of.

 

I've played with less cards than 50 when I started off with the core only. I've played with 54 at my largest (with a very limited card pool).

 

A quick search of the forums last week never really saw this talked about, but I could've missed it. Seems like 50 is "the" number. The new hero certainly looks like he'll change thinking some.

Always the best decks were no more than 50 cards (with expections, of course, but few).

Since now, with Erestor hero you can manage decks with more than 50 cards easily.

Best and most consistent decks...yes.  However, I was thinking decks maybe a little more tweaked so they don't always play out the same way. I think there was a blog I read once where the writer said he didn't always put in three copies of steward for gondor because it gets boring.

 

Also, I've noticed that many people here complete quests in WAY fewer turns than I do. My card pool is really small, so I don't have all the power cards. There was one game that I barely hung in forever until I went through my whole card pile and squeaked out a win. Maybe someone's made an insane amount of card draw that they wanted more than 50 cards before?

For the strongest decks you'll almost certainly want 50 cards.  You can maybe make an exception if you have a lot of card draw.

 

I often use 53-55 cards because I just can't bring myself to take out any other cards, even though I know my odds would be better with 50 cards.

Same I always build decks with 55 cards because I like the extra variety.

That's a whole different argument.  I rarely run 3 copies of any unique except for Light of Valinor with Glorfindel.  I also only allow myself to use Steward of Gondor if I'm using Gondor heroes or playing Nightmare quests.  I try to avoid some of the other staples like Sneak Attack + Gandalf or Unexpected Courage unless they are crucial to the deck idea.  But then there are some cards like Test of Will and Feint that you need to run 3 copies in every deck.  I just can't quit you, Test of Will.

I don't put three copies of the Steward of Gondor, not only because it would be boring but also because when I play a deck without (extensive) card draw, each card needs to count, so the extra uniques can be very annoying when you draw them instead of a card that can actually do something for you. Of course in the long run, it may not be the most powerful strategy but the purpose of games is also (or primarily) the enjoyment.

I do use extra copies of unique cards like O Lórien! in decks that can discard them -- with Daeron's Runes, for instance.

Less card in deck more effective play. More cards more chance to f***up. Simple like hell!

I generally agree with this sentiment, but there is no reason you can't have an initial build that is several cards above 50 and then prune the cards that aren't working out on the scenarios you are playing at the time.

'Nuff said. Raven1015 sums this up nicely.

Good article. Didn't see that one yet.
