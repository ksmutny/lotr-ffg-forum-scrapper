Picked up Foundations Of Stone today and have played the scenario 2-player several times.  However quite a few questions have already arisen …

 

If a player is eliminated when everyone has been seperated on stage 4 of the quest, what happens to the Enemies he is engaged with?  According to the rule book, the Enemies of an eliminated player are returned to the Staging Area but on stage 4 of this scenario, the Staging Area only applies to you.  So what happens to the Enemies?

Secondly, what if a player is eliminated while some of his cards are attached to a Nameless Enemy?  I'm assuming they stay on the Enemy until it leaves play?  But when a player is eliminated (let us for the sake of argument, given the question above, assume it is on stage 5) all his Enemies return to the staging area and can re-engage another player next turn.  So the Nameless Enemy gets 3 more cards attached to it?  Our blanket rule in situations where we're unsure is to pick the option that's least favourable for the players and that resulted in a Nameless Enemy with an attack of 20 …

Thirdly, what happens if the Hero you have to shuffle into your deck by that really stupid Treachery card just happens to be your last hero in play?  Are you out?  Your hero isn't dead and you're not at threat 50 so according to the rules, you shouldn't be eliminated …

 

Fourthly, what if some really obnoxious little ***** uses Keen-Eyed Took to discard the top card of your deck and it's your Hero?  Fortunately, this didn't actually happen but we realised that it easily could.  So when that happens are you allowed to leap over the table and punch that player in the face?

All good questions that we can add to the growing list of unresolved FOS rules questions.

1. We played that they are all discarded, but I don't think this is particularly clear.

2. I think all the cards should be discarded.

3. Good question - the underlying issue is whether a hero in deck is considered to be "dead" - this also affects scoring.

4. Clearly, yes!
