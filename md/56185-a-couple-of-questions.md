I picked up the Conflict at the Carock adventure pack yesterday and I started to look through the cards. It seems that I only have 2 quest stages, 1 Grimbeorn's Quest and 2 Against the Trolls. Should there be a third stage in the adventure pack? There doesn't seem to be any way to win the game otherwise. What am I missing?

Also a quick question about the "Caught in a Web" card. Once you have payed 2 resources from the hero with this card attached, does the card go to the discard pile or does it stay on the hero?

Conflict at Carrock only has two quest stages. Once you defeat the trolls you beat it pretty much.

The web attachment remains on the character unless removed by another card effect, Lore has an ally that removes a condition attachment when played. Paying the 2 resources does not remove the attachment, it is just the cost required to stand. It's designed so that it plays as if the hero with the attachment is struggling through the sticky web material each round.
