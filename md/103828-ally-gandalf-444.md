All cards (unless otherwise specified) are 3 per deck. Read the rulebook under the section on tournament legal decks

Note too that the restriction is specifically, three cards "by title" - so you cannot stick in 3 copies of Core Gandalf and then another three copies of Gandalf from Over Hill, Under Hill.
