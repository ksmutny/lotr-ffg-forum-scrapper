# [About Istari.....Radagast](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86509-about-istariradagast/)

Actually when i start to play i understand the neutral cards will be repersent Istari sphere. Since they can come and help anyone. But with the game grow we see different way for neutral sphere.

 

Ok i accept it. But really Radagast is another Istari in the game and he is really sucks.........!!!

His ability is not really interestng since we have much better way to play eagles. He is too expensive 5 cost and no one really play him. I think is wrong. Radagast should be very cool characters like a Gandalf but different way! Should be cool to have some kind of Animals deck with Radagast  or something.....FFG really make big mess here......

 

In ME ccg Radagast, Gandalf, Saruman, Pallando very cool mages and each of them powerfull in his way! This how is should be no?

all in good time. the only creatures we have are eagles and a few horses scattered here and there. when we see a rohan cycle we shall see horses and ents a plenty.

i also think, given that radagast gets mentioned in both the council of elrond (saga pack 2) and by treebeard, we shall hopefully see cards that make his ability rather more interesting....perhaps some 1 cost creature allies....or an attatchment that goes onto him....its not too far to ask, i mean we have sword that was broken and asfaloth, but destined for their owners

rich

PS whilst it wasnt the case that radagast was the old fool that saruman made him out to be, it must be remembered he didnt play the part that gandalf did in aiding the free peoples, though tolkien only gave hints himself that he may have forgotten his task (i do not have the letters so cannot give direct reference here).

therefore i do not think he should be as powerful as gandalf or saruman. thats not to say he should be weak- we do know that he helped the creatures of middle earth

 

i really do like the character though, both in the book and the game. the art is very good as well, and the idea of him aiding the creatures of middle earth rather than people is a nice one

I definitely wish that Radagast was more playable. I really enjoy playing Eagle decks, but at a cost of 5 he almost never pays for himself by the end of the game and his stats don't bring enough to the table when compared to Gandalf. My hope is that FFG releases a new version of Radagast that takes a different approach to his design, just like they did with Gandalf.

i think this is likely, though it is dissapointing all the same...radagast is up there in my top favourite art. i would much rather see some cards that compliment him.

 

i am not sure how they would handle a new version. it is not like gandalf where the longer he is around the more threat goes up- i do not think that applies here. i think radagast should have the following:

 

at the end of the round place 1 progress token on radagast, if radagast ever has more than progress  than his remaining hit points discard him from play. after you play a creature ally remove 1 progress from radagast

 

this shows his way of being less interested in the affairs of people. i think if there are creatures  his interest should go up

this is obviously a draw back not an ability, so like glorfindel his stats and cost should reflect this. he is rather hard to find sometimes in the book, so i think his card should also reflect this somehow, like you can exhaust a hero to search for radagast in your deck and add him to your hand- this way this is turned into a good thing

 

i would put his attack 0, defense rather low, willpower also low, however.....i think here is a chance to make a great character that needs some unique play styles.

sort of like

when radagast is in play, each creature ally you control gets +1 willpower

when i think about it radagast is a great character to design themeatically because he is so unique. he should be quite useless in himself, but a good boost to creatures

Yes that what we need. Istari is really important characters in the story so will be cool to see some new version of Radagast, maybe even hero?

Well, neutral sphere is supposed ro be just that, neutral, not "istari" sphere. I agree with you however. I love the wizards in ME, and how each had his own border color and all. I guess it will be more like that when we see istari heroes, maybe in special quests or something.

## 7 [Rapier1 on July 18, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86509-about-istariradagast/?do=findComment&comment=816375)

I think that Radagast works okay in an Eagle deck (mainly because it allows you to run eagles and not mono-tactics).

He's pretty good resource acceleration if you get him into play turn 2 (where he will pay for himself). I do wish his healing ability was better though - 1 for 1 cost is no good (as shown by Lore Glorfindel). I think I'd prefer it if he had "Response: you can spend resources from Radagast's pool to increase a stat of a creature card you control". That would make him +1 defense instead of 1 hit point (also allows creatures to quest better if used for willpower).

I think that change would easily justify his cost even if you had only a few creatures (instead of the eagle theme).

Although I could also see Radagast getting a rework to explore a different area of the character. (Perhaps having him in the Lore sphere to represent his great lore gathered from the animals - maybe even a lore hero).

Ye this card is good combo with him but.....really it worst it to put Radagastin in the deck? Most of the time answer is no.....

yeah, this is really his best use at the mo. You can tutor for any card off him, that is pretty cool. His abilities are not that interesting.. but we could see more creatures come, though there isn't a huge amount of room in LoTR for them to make things up. I'm no expert on the source but what else is there really that he could trigger? More eagles, more horses? Ents shouldn't be creatures. Spiders are bad guys... I dunno.. just doesn't seam much room for this card. The real problem is that his heal is next to useless, as most creatures have 1 health anyway.

 

Still Word of Command works very well with him and there is a chance he will improve.. but I think the most lilky thing will be that we will simply see a powercreep print of him that will basically replace him in any given situation.

Radagast + King of Morthond could be interesting. You haven't to have Hirluin, any song or narvil's belt. With Radagast, your King of Morthond haven't to be outlander deck or powerdwarf! :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

 

Your leadership deck can pay tactic eagles or spirit horses without songs and draw a card each time you play so!

Leadership deck has a lot of resources, but not cards. In the fourth round you have not cards.

 

So Radagast + King of Morthond could help.

 

Radagast in leadership deck can be played in 3rd round without problems. And then, you can play one eagle each round and draw 1 card for it.

 

Not so bad

= 3 free eagles (the eagles cost 1)

 

 

PD: and if you don't have Radagast, eagles can be played with sneak attack (and ready imrahil when they attack!) :wub: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wub.png]. Imrahil with 6 attack if you have Grave Cairn!

 

PD": if you have 2 or 3 eagles in play. Do you imagine how much attack can get Imrahil -Imrahil attacking twice-?

 

It's a good deck: Song of Combat + Radagast. Sure you can play eagles with Imrahil, one or other way...

Per my recent thread on Burden antidotes he could perhaps be designated the antidote to a Burden that reduces the effectiveness of Creature allies.  IMO Creatures don't really do enough yet to warrant such a Burden but I could see them becoming more important once we see more Rohan, as well as Shadowfax and Bill the Pony.

I've felt Radagast was a great let-down from the start. I don't understand why are his stats so bad, considering his status. I mean Longbeard elder has stats like him, and comes cheaper, and has more synergies. Again, of course, not all can make sense in the game, but Radagast is certainly a good candidate for an alternative version.

Yes i hope we will get new one much more playable..... To create kind of animal deck and he playing a main role there.

if we are getting another then he will probably be in either of the first 2 saga packs. he could be in black rider becuase he plays a part in the events around gandalfs capture, and he could be in the 2nd becuase he is mentioned in the council of elrond

Radagast with A Good Harvest could be good.

 

Text is: Action: Name a sphere. Until the end of the phase, you can spend resources of any sphere when paying for cards that belong to the named sphere.

 

 

The question is: neutral is an sphere?

I like Radagast.  He's a pretty good quester, pays for himself if you get him out early enough, can heal eagles (and maybe someday some other creatures) and makes mono-tactics decks able to quest as well as smash stuff.  Even without using Word of Command, he's a valid option.

I agree... if you got him in play early enough then he would play for himself and he was rather helpful with questing -  in saying that, its been a long time since I have included him. As I mostly run multiple sphere decks, he is rather costly, there are a lot of newer shinier cards...and not so many spaces

## 34 [Morithain on September 17, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86509-about-istariradagast/?do=findComment&comment=868306)

I've used him often to excellent effect in my mono-tactics deck with Legolas, Bard, and Beregond.  (we affectionately call it "Birds, Bows, and Beregond").  This deck has swarms of Eagles, Radagast, and shiny stuff for Beregond to use for defense, and the two archers for attack.  The oft-bemoaned inability of Tactics to effectively quest is partially alleviated by building up enough birds and having Radagast around to quest as well as pay for bird things.  As for support, it  is extraordinarily beastly at dealing with enemies, since there is no better defender than Beregond--especially when you get Eagles of the Misty Mountains built up, then put support of the Eagles on Beregond.  At one point I had his defense up to 11 (4 base + 2 for Gondorian Shield + 4 for Support of the Eagles + 1 for Dúnedain Signal).  Beregond the Invincible!  And as the recent Championship tells us, Legolas is an excellent attacker and adds further questing ability with his progress tokens.  And when he and Bard both use Great Yew Bows on the staging area, stuff just dies.

Support of the Eagles paired with the Eagles of the Misty Mountains that has several fallen eagle allies attached to it is one of the craziest hero boosts I've seen in this game.  I can remember one quest where I had Tactics Boromir battling for 8 and destroying everything in sight.

I used Radagast efectively only in a mono tactics deck with eagles. Not much more. I think he would be better if Secrecy had been developed to allow some interesting decks with eagles.

Anyway, I expect to see more creatures released and some more Istari cards, so I think he would have a place in some of our hearts/decks.
