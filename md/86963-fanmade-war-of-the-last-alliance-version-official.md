**** Re-edited on 26-novembre-2013. With all last changes done. ****

 

It's finished. I've open other thread to do it more simply because it is already done. These are the latest and definitive worked cards:

Congratulations on trying something so ambitious!

 

1B: should say "When Revealed: the first player..."

The encounter set icons are confusing as you haven't used the standard icons. Also, can the quest only be played by people who own ALL the expansions? That's a pretty limited number of players.

 

How many copies of Elven Alliance and Human Alliance are there?

 

Please make sure this quest gets some play-testing :-)

It looks very interesting , but I will wait to see the rest of the cards in order to express my opinion :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Thanks for your comments.

1B (get an extra Noldor hero) is not only for the first player. Is for all players in game. But the text is better if there is "when revealed" at starting, as you say.

Yes, you have to have all encounter cards from CORE to Cicle of Dwarrowelf. Lol. This quest is specially designed to OCTGN, but if players have got all the cards, sure they can play it. Enjoy!

I want to create a Quest Sheet on tell about all the things, as 4 copies of Elven Alliance and 4 of Human Alliance, and display all icons sets, not only icons collection.

I've played it alone twice. With the two better decks at the moment: powerdwarfs and outlanders. I won. And i played with other friend, me with outlanders and he with poweredwarfs, we won.

Maybe it's a lot of difficult, but not much as Into Ithilien or Cair Andros. In these adventures, you also have to have powered decks.

There are all the cards of this encounter set. You must add the Orcs and Goblins specified in the 1a.

I though there were going to be hero cards for Isildur etc , my mistake :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Maybe be a good idea Isildur as a hero, but i don't want so much fanmade cards.

I think it's enough to be a "gondor" trait, instead.

Elven Alliance has a typo - it should say "one of your Gondor heroes".

Omg, true!

 

This is because i change the text and drawing cards by strange eons to geckho templates. I considered they are better designed. But in the "re-writing" i could forget any keyword.

 

Thanks!

It is just that there are some characters that were important on the war of the last alliance, like Isildur, Gil Galad, Elendil ... so maybe they coulb de included, but it is your call 

 

 

Well done for your nice work  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Gil Galad is the "Noldor" discarded to get Narsil.

lol

 

You can't be so much strict at the history tale, or..., what do Legolas, Aragorn, other guys, etc. do here?

Correct ... but since Elves that exist on cards where there - or at least where alive- like (Elrond, Glorfindel, Gildor who is not a hero though), so maybe they took part even if there is no mention), having two or three Men Heroes would be ok for two players ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

 

The Noldor discard idea is clever  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

The fanmade is official in OCTGN already! The text of the cards were changed a little bit from the cards at the starting of this thread.

I've just played with other friend. We won. 128 final score, in 8 rounds. Nothing bad.

 

I had an outlanders deck. Other friend played tactic deck

 

Outlanders is great here, but i think without outlanders also players can win.

 

Useless cards from CORE as Rain of Arrows [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/core/rain-of-arrows-core] or Thicket of Spears [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/core/thicket-of-spears-core] are powerfull here! You must construct deck with these cards and a lot of allies and you can win. And other good cards sure.

And take care of don't lose objectives!!! They can't, as Troll Key and Troll Purse [http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/843685/troll-key-and-troll-purse], and as 2b writes, the result is: ever objectives are discarded in this stage, they return to a gondor hero. Even is they are in game as a shadow. Cheers!

Congratulations, I am proud of you.

But since I only play official scenarios, probably never gonna play it.

Np problem Rekath, fanmades are absolutely "freeware" :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] .

 

Other "supercards", at first useless, but here a lot of powerfull (these 2 are combo):

 

Light the Beacons [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/heirs-of-numenor/light-the-beacons-hon]

New higscore in 2 players. 116points, in 6 rounds.

 

And i haven't played with outlanders or poweredwarfs deck. I played: Hama, Legolas, and Beravor (and fourth extra hero: Elladan). I played a lot of times: thicket of spears, rain of arrows ("war cards" :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png])

My friend, yes, he played outlanders.

 

Very easy with outlanders.

But, not needed in both players. Only one. Next quest: without none outlanders neither dwarfs!!!

This is so cool!

 

I really like the idea of using encounter sets from older cycles! They should definitely do something like this for one of the Gen-Con quests.
