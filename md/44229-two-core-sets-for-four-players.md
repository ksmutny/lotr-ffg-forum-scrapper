# [Two Core Sets for Four Players?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/44229-two-core-sets-for-four-players/)

I've been looking over the Info on the core set, and it seems to me that the set comes with enough cards for four people.  Four starter decks, and twelve heroes.  The second set would be usefull for the two extra threat trackers, and the extra tokens, and, I suppose, some greater versitility with the cards.  But with extra decks coming out you don't really need the extra cards from the core set.  Is the only reason to buy the second set the threat trackers and tokens for a four man game?  Or have I missed something here?

I don't think you're missing anything, that's exactly how it appears to be.

I wouldn't think so, as when the encounter deck runs out, you just reshuffle its discard pile and use that.

The encounter deck doesn't change with the number of players.

 In the core set there are 120 player cards divided between 4 people gets you 30 cards a person.
The deck building rules (pg. 27) say that a deck should be a minimum of 50 cards.
So more than threat dials, at least initially you don't have enough cards to build 4 legal decks.

No, minimum 50 cards deck rule is for tournaments and for mixed decks. You can use the four standard decks as an introduction to the game and four people can play with just one core set.The only promblem i think is that one core set has only 2 threat meters and maybe wound tokens and progress tokens arent enough for 4 players.

PsiThundara is right. The standard game is 50 cards so that is why would need the extra core set. After a few adventure packs come out won't be an issue.

Then that counts for 2 players too.If you and your friend want to use one hero of the same sphere  you cant both have 50 cards deck.Why?Because one fixed deck of the same sphere has only 30 cards and if you split them you will have a 45 cards deck.If both of you want 50 cards each you must use 3 diferent spheres and i dont think a deck like this will ever work.So for a 50 cards deck 2 core sets are needed even for 2 players(except if you can agree with your friend that you cant both have a hero of the same sphere).

I don't think it would be that hard. There are 12 characters, can only use 3 at a time. Unless you have some jerks for friends would not be that hard to make the one core set into 2 50 card decks. And if you do, then why bother playing with them in the first place. I think you over complicate things Servant. Building two decks will be easy with what you get.

Ofcourse you can build 2 decks with just one core set.Its not only about jerk friends but for the fun factor also.For example if Legolas is my favorite character and Gimli my friend's favorite character and i want to mix Legolas with tactik sphere heroes and my friend wants to mix Gimli with lore sphere heroes its not possible with just one box.

But as i said in my other post a good friend with a second core set is allways welcomegui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif].

I am sure you can agree to build the deck you both wantthen take turns using it so you both get to use your favorite characters.

The answer here is simple. Buy two core sets.

Simple yes, not necessarily affordable for all.

plus from the look of the videos and from previous LCG releases, I assume some player deck cards will come in singles in the core set, so if you really want three of those cards for your tournament deck you end up having to buy three core sets; which really is a lot of waste.

It looks to me like there really is a need for a 4 players/tournament deck expansion which has player deck cards to bring each card in the core set up to three, but without the unneccessary quest, encounter or hero cards.

It could contain 2 extra threat tracks and tokens if price allows. I'd probably happily pay core set prices for the expansion even if it had less overall cards.

Rather that than having to buy two, maybe even three core sets to get a full card set to choose from for tournament decks.

lol, ya I don't have that option. I work from home so I don't really pay for lunch anywayI'm diabetic so skipping a meal would be just stupid.

Either way I myself am happy with just one core set. I had one for GoT for a year before I ever got the 2nd one. Worked out fine.

 I'll definitely be fine with one core deck. Until I fall in love with certain cardsalways want three of them in my deck. When that happens, I'll have to weigh the number of cards that I want that I would get in a second core set against the price. Or just go to ebayhope I can find them. 

Just to be safe, maybe I should just get core sets until I have three of every card. Just in case. Yeah, why do I feel like Smeagol right about now...

LOL, I will eventually get two if only so that I can start my binders up. I have one of every GoT cards in my two binders for itwill do the same for LotR.

I guess my main problem with the way this is set up, is that with my second purchase of a core set, I am buying, quest, encounter,hero cards that I will never use,that it was designed that way.  I will likely still buy the second set, but I wish a four player expansion had been thought of, to keep us from paying for wasted cards. 

## 21 [DrNate on March 25, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/44229-two-core-sets-for-four-players/?do=findComment&comment=443800)

Yeah, all those useless cards is what will probably make me go to ebay for extras that I need instead of a second full set. Because I know I am going to want more cards...scratch that, NEED more cards, my precious! But I suspect I can do better that way. Well, I'll know for sure once I have them in hand. I sure would love to have a basic 3 of each playset without having to throw away hundreds of cards.  I guess that is the nature of all trading card games, though.

Why is it, every time i use the word "a-n-d" that the forum eats it? Do I have some setting on that needs to be turned off? It is hard to write posts without using such a basic word.

Honestly I found with 2 GoT core sets I had little waste. Put 1 of each card in my binders gave any extras to friends to get them started hooked into the game. Went from just me to 5 players in a couple months. Give em a taste they wants more. demonio.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/demonio.gif]

I'm guessing that AGoT has fewer cards that are just one needed than LotR will have. I could be wrong, who knows?

I will try your idea. I can think of at least one person who might like to have some Lord of the Rings extra cards that I don't need when...I mean IF I end up buying multiple core sets. IF.

I'm not addicted to a card game that isn't even out yet...I'm not...

Except in this case everyone might also think the same way as no one is going to want to have quest card doubles as no one will buy them on e-bay! I really do think FFG should think about a way of getting an upgrade for the core set to up the number of all the players cards to three.

The idea of the LCG is supposed to get away from the idea of having hundreds of wasted cards,the epxansion packs reoslve this, but then seem to not quite have got it right for core sets (yet).

The forum was eating the word a-n-d as well as the word o-r from my posts; its wierd, ain't it... very recent occurrence, it never used to do it!

It has been doing it to me too. I keep having to go back to edit my posts.

As for the complaints about core set, its been done on all of the forums for all the LCG's and FFG has yet to change it. But if you do what I did and give the extras to friends you will find it helps clear out extra unwanted stuff it gets your friends hooked too. And then if they do get their own core set they can do the same with their extras, starts a snowball effect of bringing in new players.

I agree.  I'm a casual player and just game with my two boys.  It seems really stupid to spend another 40 bucks just to get the dial trackers and tokens.  The expansion packs will provide plenty of cards, so no worries there.  I could really care less about having three of each card as well.  It's been difficult just trying to figure out how to buy this product for casual play, too.  FFG recommends 2 core sets, which is why I thought it was necessary.  But I can use pencil and paper and other tokens if necessary.  I don't understand why they didn't just include enough in the core set for 4 people or at least offer an expansion.  Really poor idea on their part.  The game looks awesome, but the underhanded marketing scheme to sell more product than is necessary really turns me off. :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png] 

 

Wasn't transparency supposed to be the whole point of LCG?

I will say it again. You do not need two core sets of any of the LCG's. I spent a year with AGoT with only one and now I have only two. Once some adventure packs come out for LotR you will have more than enough cards.

Just buy one core set for now. Then later on if you feel the need get another but I don't think you will ever NEED a second one. Especially if you are just playing casually with your kids. The only people that will need extra core sets are the completists and those who want to play competitively.

LCG's are transparent. You know what you are buying every time you buy one. You get at least one of every single card. No other card games other than deck builiding ones can make that claim and no TCG/CCG can at all.

But there's one reason why you might want to buy a second core set that no one seems to be talking about: customizing the encounter deck. To me the draw of this game (besides all of the obvious ones) is that you can continually balance it to your liking. You customize your player decks to conquer the encounter deck, and then you customize the encounter deck to conquer the player decks, and on and on for virtually infinite replay value. It doesn't seem like you could do much customizing of the encounter deck with just one core set (granted, my copies are still on their way).

I'd rather wait for the new cards in the APs. The more different cards there are the more possibilities you have to customize stuff. I enjoy using semi-random decks, i.e. there's a core of about 36 cards (12x3) that are fixed and have been carefully selected to work well together. Then I add 14 random cards (of the same factions used in the fixed deck). This creates decks that work pretty well but still have this fun surprise factor that can force you to come up with new combos or just play cards you'd otherwise never use.

I think this should work marvelously with encounter decks: Use a fixed base (i.e. the standard encounter deck) then add a bunch of random cards from the other APs. Maybe you'd have to tweak some other things to make it work well, e.g. to compensate for a bigger encounter deck, but I'm sure it's doable.

Eh, maybe I won't even want to go three player anyway.  I wonder if the game gets more complex and takes longer if you go beyond 2 player.  It might be simpler just to play 2 player games anyhow.

I am not usually a fan of FFG marketing strategies, but in this case I think that given this game can be played solo quite well, buying two core sets if you have four friends to play with is not a waste of cards. Just let one of your friends take the extra Encounter/Quest cards back home to train up his deck handling abilities a bit for next gaming session.

 

And having a fairly succesful single sphere deck definitely needs two sets. Most cards (the best ones usually) of each Sphere don´t come with three copies. You want those for the hard quests for sure.

So does that mean there is actually a purpose in having three sets?  I'm still confused on that as well.  I thought the new LCG format was going to have 3 copies of every card.  Will the Adventure Packs for LOTR be back to having single copies now?

No, no..  nothing is changing. The Adventure Packs will continue to have 3 copies of each card.

 

The Core Sets have NEVER contained three of each card. That's why people who are in the competitive games buy multiple sets of the Core Games. But that only applies to the Core Sets  in the other of the LCGs. The rationale for doing in Lord of the Rings is having enough cards to serve the needs of 4 players (though as has been discussed, there will still be some extras).

 

In fact, in Call of Cthulthu, they are reprinting some of the original CCG "packs" (from before the LCG concept was implemented) to have three of each card, whereas before they only had one.

minor correction: They will have three copies of all player cards (excepting Heroes which will come with a single copy each). Encounter cards can come in any number, assumably from 1 to 5, just as they do in the core set.
