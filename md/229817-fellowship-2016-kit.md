Anyone know why they are only including enough for 3 players per kit this year instead of 4, as in previous years?

I'd they so you are more flexiable at how many you want to order.

The question is did they lower the price (by 25%), too? If so it really dosn't matter. If not you have your answer ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

Last years the szenario could be played by 1-4 players. So if you want to bring 4 players to the table make the kit holding stuff for 4 players.

 

this year the szenario has an epic multiplayer. You need 3 copies of the szenario and a minimum of 3 players to play in this mode = kit holds stuff for 3 players.

Makes complete sense. Thanks for the reply, JanB.

Yeah, my FLGS asked in advance how many people were attending and how many wanted the quest/playmat for ordering purposes. Some people were couples or bringing people not seriously involved in the game that wouldn't need or want it. Those people probably won't have to pay the $20 to participate in the event, but still get to play.

It's a hard choose that buy 1 or 3 copies of this quest when it's available.

 

Maybe one is enough, if I can find so much players to play the epic mode, sure I can find the other 2 copies.

It will be available for sale later on the FFG website, so I wouldn't worry about only getting 1 copy for now.
