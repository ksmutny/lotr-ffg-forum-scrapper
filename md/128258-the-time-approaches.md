The Antlered Crown must be releasing in less than a month. Get hyped.

Well just got my butt beat by Celebrimbor so I can wait for AC. I've handled that one well but it can vary quite a bit. Very happy with it.

## 3 [Bullroarer Took on December 2, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/128258-the-time-approaches/?do=findComment&comment=1353210)

Why must it?

## 4 [MyNeighbourTrololo on December 2, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/128258-the-time-approaches/?do=findComment&comment=1353222)

Because it is listed as Expected by:  Q4 2014.

 

And... you know, there is less than a month left of Q4 2014.

## 5 [chuckles on December 2, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/128258-the-time-approaches/?do=findComment&comment=1353237)

Its been 'on the boat' since 11/5/2014 - If that date relates when the status changed from 'at the printer'?

 

I'll settle for a new spoiler as it will be sometime in the new year before its available for me to order :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

 

same day global releases would be AWESOME!!!

Got it.  And since the upcoming list is NEVER wrong it must be here soon.

I'm pretty surprised at how long its been since we got any news to be honest. Expected to have both an article for Antlered Crown AND something for either the first AP of Angmar Awakened or a second article for Treason of Saruman by now. I guess with the whole holiday rush its understandable though.... still pretty dissappointing.

I'm not disappointed as such.. but waiting rather impatiently for news and spoilers - sucks that they make such an appealing game!  :rolleyes: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_rolleyes.gif] 

 

Being available in time for Christmas (for overseas customers) would have been mint. Oh well.

Still waiting for Nin-in...

In Spain, december 31 is the expected release date...

Lol!  :lol: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_laugh.png]

I wouldn't be surprised if it was December 31, 23:59:59  :lol: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_laugh.png]

## 13 [Dunlander on December 2, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/128258-the-time-approaches/?do=findComment&comment=1354029)

Yeah, I'm checking expectantly on a daily basis for some Lost Realm/Angmar Awakened spoilers. Bummed out so far.

I don't know why you're expecting an article for Antlered Crown before it comes out. They've only done 2 articles for each other pack in the cycle. One to announce it and one on release. How have you not figured out the pattern yet??

 

I'm expecting AC this month as we've been getting monthly releases all cycle pretty much. I think they might have missed one month but we got 2 the next. My guess is that the upcoming for it will go green this week or next and it will come out week before Christmas the latest. Highly doubt it will come out Christmas week.

Good news: An Antlered Crown attachment card has been leaked:

 

jaegermeister.jpg [https://quotenqueen.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/jaegermeister.jpg]

 

 

Text says: "Exhaust attached character and discard Jägermeister to give every character the 'Silvan' trait until the end of the turn. Restricted to Silvan characters."

Love the flavor text :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

It seems Caleb and Matt are losing focus...

I also don't think we will see any news on AC, but that is not necessary either...the release will be enough :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] Although I am still waiting on CS (expected shipping date is January here! :angry: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_angry.png] )

What I really am looking forward though is the spoiler for the first AP of Angmar Awakened! We almost know nothing about the new cycle, yet almost the last AP from this cycle is out...

Christmas gift ^^

Hopefully we'll get a spoiled card by the Grey Company or Couple vs Cardboard.

## 22 [Epi Lepi on December 12, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/128258-the-time-approaches/?do=findComment&comment=1365324)

I was expecting it the 18th since they've been doing Thursday releases, but who cares IT'S ALMOST HERE!!

## 23 [Muddypaw on December 13, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/128258-the-time-approaches/?do=findComment&comment=1365936)

At least it's showing as 'shipping now' rather than still on the boat. Fingers crossed we'll know all soon! It's the first pack I've had to wait for after I played catch up and am finally up to date on everything.

Being mostly a player of Rohan decks I'm especially keen to know who the hero is. Gamling maybe, as he knows most about the Dunlendings and seems to have more dealings with them than most?
