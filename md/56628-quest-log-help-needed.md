# [Quest Log - Help needed](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56628-quest-log-help-needed/)

Hi guys!


today I discovered the Quest Log for the LotR LCG, and I entered the few games I played. After submitting the scores, I tried to see the Summary, just to check if everything was ok, but I haven't found any entry. All quests are marked as "incompleted". Probably I've done something wrong, but I can't find out what. Anyone of you can help me?


Thanks a lot


JULIA

I'm not sure what would cause that.  The summary shows 0 quests successfully completed?  

What date did you enter for your logged quests?  If it was before November, those quests won't show up on the Summary page, because that is when the scoring system was changed.  

You can also check the quests you've already logged by going to the Log Quest page and scrolling down to the bottom.  It should show all quests you've entered.  There is an edit option in the bottom-right corner of each quest.  You can edit them and see if you forgot to enter something.

Hi Kiwina,

thank you for your answer. Yes, the Summary shows 0 Quests completed. I tried to re-enter the data, but nothing changed.

Ok for the score, the games I logged were played in June, so I can accept there is no score, but anyway, why no games are logged? The Log Quest is empty

OUCH. Sorry. I had to ask for the quests before November, the 1st. I just noticed now the lik on the bottom of the page.

Sorry sorry sorry ::ashamed::

Or maybe are you simply ubiquitous? ::laughter::
