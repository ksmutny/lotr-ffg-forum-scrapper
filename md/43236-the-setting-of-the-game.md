I was just wondering about the time setting of the game, which claims to be between The Hobbit and Lord Of The Rings, and yet we have Thorin in the base set who fell at the end of The Hobbit.

I guess they are just freely choosing from both books, so you can craft you adventures wherever and whenever you want.

 This has already been addressed in the EOWYN+THORIN=... thread. Check it out.

Hey thanks for the pointer.  I hadn't twigged what that was about from the title of the post.

At deciphers Lotr tcg you can have Gil-Galad,Isildur and Beorn in the same deck with Aragorn or Eowyn and its not a real promblem.I dont think that they want as to role play the books.They just let you choose any hero you want from Tolkiens world and explore Middle Erth in that time line.

I'm glad they pulled it off so that they can have characters from both the Hobbit & LOTR.  Based on the characters released so far, it sounds like they have much more free reign than they did with Middle-Earth Quest.  If they were strictly chained to the book storylines, it would not be a very flexible card game!

Yes i don't really have a problem with it, was just curious.  It's already non-canon in the nature of the quests and events.  And has previously been discussed in the other thread, players are free to choose how they want to build their decks.  Personally i like to go more with theme in deck construction rather than just creating a killer deck.
