 It's been a while since I have played tactics, and I have never used horn of gondor a lot.  I only get resource tokens when one of my characters goes out or do I get it ern enemies go out too?

Enemies aren't characters.

You won't get resources from enemies leaving play, but you WILL get resources from any departing heroes or allies--including those controlled by other players. Play it in conjunction with a Rohan deck and let the good times roll. Horn of Gondor really gets exponentially better in multi-player games.

@starhawk77-I totally agree. We play in a group of 4, the Horn rocks!

Let's not forget muemakan's trick of playing the Sneak/Gandalf combo for free 3x in one round using the horn's ability. gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]

 Yeah, Horn of Gondor in a multi-player game when one person is using Rohan and another is using Eagles can get RIDICULOUS!

in our todays 3 player game, Denethor with the Horn gained  3 Resource on average, as we played cheap allies (like snowburn scout) to get their enter-play bonuses and then feeded them to the oncoming orcs.  so yes it shines in multiplayer

this has nvr come up in our games yet.. but yes.. that is a cool combo.. nice one! Though pretty hard to pull off due to having to have 3 sneak in hand and a gandalf.. so that is a 4 draw to get the combo engine running.. oh wait a 5 draw as you need horn as well... no wonder I haven't seen this.

This game needs more dig effects gandalf's search (but better) and Gildor b4 combos like this can really get off the ground as a planned strategy.

While the Horn is great for big multi-player games, I think it is overrated for single player.  You have to lose at least three allies before it even begins to pay off, and you would often be better off with another ally or attachment in its stead.

The horn is not so bad even for single player. If you use it in conjunction with keen eyed took it turns him from costly to next to nothing in order to cycle.
