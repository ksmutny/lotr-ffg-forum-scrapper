From the new FAQ

> Q: If there is an active location with a Response effect that triggers when it is explored and the players make enough progress to explore the location and advance to the next stage, when do the players resolve the location’s Response effect?

> A: The players should advance to the next stage immediately and resolve any ‘when revealed’ effects on the next stage, then resolve the Response effect on the active location.

What if the active location has a Forced effect? Does that change the order?

I believe a Forced effect is considered a type of Response.
