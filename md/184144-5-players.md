Howdy, friends!

I searched around for an answer to this, but to no avail. Is it possible to play with five players? Has anyone tried this?

Thanks for any help!

You theoretically could for most quests.  Sometimes you need 1 encounter or quest card per player and there are only 4 available, but most of the time you technically could so it.  However, the game is most balanced for 2 players and often with 4 players some quests can become overly challenging or easy.  5 player would make only make the balance worse.

 

So yes, you could play with 5.  I would personally rather split into 2 games, but if you really want to play with 5 you could do it most of the time.
