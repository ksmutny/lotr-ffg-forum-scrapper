# [A few question from a beginning player](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57960-a-few-question-from-a-beginning-player/)

## 1 [Serazu on December 23, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57960-a-few-question-from-a-beginning-player/?do=findComment&comment=570809)

Good day,

After my first playthrough in the game, there were a few issues that arose. Could you please enlighten me?

1. Concerning the “Quick Strike” event, can I use it to attack an enemy who is in the staging area or do I have to be engaged with it?

2. When I attack an enemy with the above event, do I deal a Shadow card to my adversary?

3. Do I reveal a card during the Staging step of the Quest phase even if I did not commit any character beforehand?

4. Does the Quest Resolution step of the above phase resolve, even if I haven't got characters committed to the quest? If, for instance, a location with threat 2 is in the staging area and there are no characters committed, does the threat raise by 2?

5. Do I deal Shadow cards to enemies engaged who are prevented from attacking, i.e. by a card such as Forest Snare?

6. During the Combat phase, may I attack an enemy who attacked in the previous stage of the phase? I guess so, otherwise I would only be able to attack only once in a while and only against opponents forbidden from attacking.

7. Do enemies exhaust?

Thanks.

1. No, unless you use Dunhere to attack. This is answered in the new FAQ from FFG I believe. http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_minisite_sec.asp?eidm=129&esem=4 [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_minisite_sec.asp?eidm=129&esem=4]

2. No, because only you attack.

3. You do reveal a card whether you commit somebody or not.

4. Yes

5. Yes

6. Yes

7. It would´t matter..........you can exhaust them to indicate if they already attacked you or not...........otherwise it´s useless.

Thanx. Two more questions:

1. I may use an action that does not demand to exhaust somebody / something, as many times as I can, as long as I am able to pay the cost, right? i.e., if Protector of Lorien is attached to my hero, I may discard all the cards in my hand, to give him the equivalent number of Will / Def, in the form of Action + Action etc. Am I correct?

2. When I use the Strider's Path event, do I skip the Quest resolution?

2. No, up until now you never ever skip quest resolution...........maybe there´ll come a time in the future where we can.

 I'm fairly certain that if an enemy is forbidden from attacking (Feint, Forest Snare, etc) then they do not get a Shadow card, as a Shadow card is dealt to attackers only (same reason you wouldn't deal a Shadow card to the victim of a Quick Strike).

Engaged enemies always get shadow cards, whether they can attack or not.  From the rules (p. 18): 

"At the beginning of the combat phase, the players deal 1 shadow card to each engaged enemy. Deal the top card of the encounter deck, face down, to each engaged enemy."

This is stated before the section "Resolving enemy attacks" and the four steps involved in an enemy attack.

1. Concerning "Quick Strike" though, I do not deal a Shadow card to target enemy, right? Unless of course it's the beginning of the combat phase, in which case everything resolves according to rules and of course it's a bad idea to use the event anyway.

2. When effects state "deal X damage to..." I deal the full X damage without reduction due to Defense. Correct?

1. Are Shadow cards considered in play?

2. Concerning the 2B quest card of the the Hunt for Gollum, what happens if, while resolving the Forced effect, draw 2 Treacheries?

3. In the above case, what if I draw an Enemy / Location and a Treachery? May I opt to discard the Enemy or Location and keep the Treachery?

One more question:

What if I defeat the attached enemy or explore the attached location on Signs of Gollum, but opt not to take the clue? Will it just stay in the staging area waiting for me to pick it up if I beat a quest, without further interaction with the game? If another Signs comes into play will it interact with the old Signs in any way?

1. not 100% on this, but i would say technically yes but overall no as you disregard all other text on the card apart from the shadow  underneath the line, although if it is a card like wolf rider then things change as the card itself is in play after it is drawn as a shadow card

 

2. and 3. i believe you can chose here, the text doesnt really state otherwise

 

4. yes it remains there unguarded till you quest sucessfully and pick it up, the only iteraction i can think of is that it still adds to hunters from mordor statistics buff

1. Let’s say then that I pick a Location and a Treachery. The staging area is full of Locations and I do not want another one. I decide to choose the Treachery. I discard the Location. Am I forced to resolve the Treachery? I ‘m asking because, technically, Treacheries do not enter the staging area, which is exactly what the Quest dictates. Cannot I just initially pick the Treachery and then discard it without ever resolving its effect? I know it's like cheating and I sound like a complete ass, I 'd like to know nonetheless.

2. Successfully questing  means beating the quest resolution during the Quest phase, right?

3. Legolas's effect, for instance, does not count as successfully questing, right?

4. If I beat the quest resolution step, but put my progress tokens in an active location, this still counts as successfully questing, right?

5. Concerning my question regarding the Signs, it remains there unguarded, ok. What if another Signs enters play? I do not re-guard the original Signs, right? The "If another objective...the original keyword effect." phrase in the first paragraph under "Guarded" (Rules of Play, pg. 24) is irrelevant here, since it refers to a different instance, correct?

The text on a shadow card (including the card title and keywords) are ignored (considered blank) except those under the shadow line.  So technically it is considered in play, but currently no shadow cards have effect beside its shadow effect.

If you select a treachery card, it is revealed so it has to be resolved and then enters the encounter discard pile.

Page 14 of the rulebook says, "If the [Will Power] is higher, the players ave successfully quest, ..."  So if and only if the Will Power is higher than the Threat, it is considered successfully quested. Legolas's effect does not count as successfully quested, and to where the progress tokens are put has no relation with the status of successfully quested or not.

Yes, it says, "If another objective card comes up WHILE attaching a card for the guarded keyword,...", so it is another situation entirely.

1. Concerning the "Surge" keyword, the rules state that it applies at the staging step of the Quest phase; this effectively means that if I put to the staging area a card with that keyword, following the instructions on the first two quests of Hunt for Gollum, "Surge" does not apply, since this happens outside the staging step. Correct?

2. Cards with the "Victory X" keyword that I defeat are set aside for score calculation and are not re-shuffled if the Encounter deck runs out of cards. Correct?

3. If I explore a Location with the aforementioned keyword with the Northern Tracker's ability, I still get the card. Right?

4. Is there a specific moment during the Quest phase that the encounter deck, if depleted, is re-shuffled and put back to the game or does it happen at any moment, as long as it's the Quest phase? The rules make no mention to a specific moment, so I guess it happens at the exact instance the deck runs out of cards during the Quest phase. If it was depleted before, then, the moment the Quest phase begins, the discard pile is re-shuffled into a new deck. Right?

5. There is neither a draw cap nor a cap as to how many cards I may have in hand. Right?

1. new faq states it should be played at ALL times, including set up- same goes for doomed x

2.yes, otherwise emyn muil would be nigh on impossible (all locations are victory x and you collect them)

3.yes

4.as soon as it runs out in the quest phase, i dont see anything to state otherwise

5.there is no limit, but once it is depleted it is gone for good

In my last The Hunt for Gollum playthrough I drew a Signs of Gollum. I drew again to satisfy the "Guarded" keyword. I drew another Signs. Following the rules, I temporarily set it aside so as to draw again to put a card on the original Signs and then to draw once more to put a card on the second Signs. The card I drew was a Treachery with the "Surge" keyword. I resolved it, discarded it (and thus dealt with the original Signs) and drew again as the "Surge" dictates. The Location I drew, I put it on the second Signs to satisfy its "Guarded" keyword. Did I do the right thing or that Location entered play exclusively to satisfy the "Surge" of the card I previously drew and I should have just put it on the staging area and draw once more to satisfy  the second Sign's "Guarded" keyword? To put it short, did I draw a card less?

so basically you used the surged card to guard? if this is the case then i would say you drew one card too short...if you tallied the cards you needed to draw at that time, you would end up with the amount that you did, plus 1 more that you didnt which satisfys the surge keyword

 

if the actual case is that you DO use the surged card then i would find this a strange rule as it effectivly makes the surge effect useless in that scenario

I think you did draw one card short. The last card you drew was there exclusively to satisfy the surge effect. You needed one more to satisfy the guarded effect on the objective. Generally, one action cannot be used to satisfy two separate effects.

Thank you for your answers. One more question:

Is there a negative modifier on threat or does the minimum possible is zero? Logic dicates that it cannot be less than zero (what's the meaning of being minus concerning threat after all, go to Sauron's door and yell "here I am"?). I know that counting score can lead to negative numbers, but I 've always presumed minimum threat to be no less than zero.

By the way, Hunt for Gollum is exceptionally easy with a Spirit / Lore deck. Nice playthrough but absolutely no challenge.

no i wouldnt think it can go into minus, theres nowhere in the rules or on the threat tracker to show this, also as the cards stand there is nothing that can bring it to zero

 

even with three 7 cost heros (21) and using galadhrims greeting 3 times in a row for the first 3 rounds that would still make (24-18) 6 threat.

If a Signs with a guardian card attached is in play and False Lead is revealed, is the guardian card discarded when the clue is shuffled back into the deck? I 'd say yes, since it's supposed to be attached to Signs, right?

Never mind, the FAQ state that it remains in play.

1. To the River Quest card: I had already 8+ progress tokens on the quest card, an active location, but I had yet to beat the Troll. I beat it. I automatically advanced to the next quest card. What should have happened to the active location? I discarded it. Was it right on my behalf or should it had been left in play as an active location to the next quest card?

2. Dol Guldur Beastmaster: The card text and the FAQ state that when chosen as an attacker, another Shadow card is dealt to it. Suppose that it's engaged along another enemy of, let's say, 20 engagement cost. Which should be the correct order shadow cards are dealt during the next phase? I suppose it goes like this: The uppermost card in the deck goes to the Dol, the one right below it goes to the other enemy, then, when the Dol is chosen as an attacker, it gets the next card on the deck. Correct?

3. When card effects force me to discard progress tokens from the current quest, this means firstly take them from the active locations and if there are no locations active, the quest card. Right?

1. think you shoulda' left that one in play (edit: have doubled checked and yes it does- otherwise ive been playing it wrong for months)

2.i think you are correct but i would wait for more input on that one

3.no from the quest only i google this and this came up from the FAQ

Removing Progress Tokens from Quests
When a card effect removes progress tokens from a
quest or quest card, the effect applies specifically to the
quest card, and never to the active location.

 note though that when a card states ADD to current quest,(legolas)  then you add to the current location as it acts as a buffer still

1. The location stays active until it's explored, so you should have left it in play.

2. You play the second card when the Beastmaster attacks, so you're correct (not that it really matters).

3. In this case you don't have to remove them from locations. Say you have 2 tokens on a location and none on your quest and you get the Misty Mountain Goblins as a shadow card, nothing would happen. It's also in the FAQ:

(1.05) Removing Progress Tokens from Quests
When a card effect removes progress tokens from a
quest or quest card, the effect applies specifically to the
quest card, and never to the active location.

 

About your question regarding guarded attachments, I let the guarding cards stay in play. Again, this is handled in the FAQ:

(1.17) Unclaimed Objectives
An unclaimed objective is one that is not currently
claimed and under the control of a player. An
unclaimed objective can be guarded or unguarded.
A guarded objective is treated like an attachment if
guarded by an enemy or location, and remains attached
to that card until it leaves play, at which point it will
return to the staging area. Any unclaimed objective
in the staging area that is not attached to a card is
considered to be unguarded. If an objective is claimed
at one point, and then returns to the staging area, it
regains the status of unclaimed.

 

So the objective card is attached to the guard, and not the other way around. In your examp,e the guard would simply loose its attachment.

Here's a couple questions I have.

1. When combining multiple core sets, what cards do you use and which ones do you not?

2. When adding cards from the adventure packs, do you just keep adding the cards from a particular sphere to the ones you're already using?

3. Is there a max number of cards that the player can have in his deck when playing against a scenario?

As you can see, I am REALLY a beginner.

1. You can have up to 3 copies of each card in your deck.

2. You can do that. But you can also start deck building , mix spheres etc.

3. No, there is not. However, the minimum number is 50 and players tend to stick with this number.

just a point on that one if you're new to deckbuilding in general, you dont want to have too many cards in your deck, otherwise it is harder to draw the cards you really want, and be able to use certain combos that are available to you. sorry if that was an obvious point.

1. If there is an active location before the quest card and the latter leaves play through an effect followed by the next quest, the active location stays active; right?

2. Dreadful Gap: If revealed during staging, I travel there, the quest phase goes on though and resolves as usual, much like in the Strider's Path case; right?

3. Chieftain of the Pit: If revealed as a shadow card, do I declare a new defender vs the attacking enemy, does the exhausted defender that defended initially vs the attacker defends again or does the second attack go unopposed?

yes

yes, though if a location like east gate is active (cant remember if the encounter set is used in into the pit) it is immune and therefore dreadful gap doest have effect.

3. Chieftain of the Pit: If revealed as a shadow card, do I declare a new defender vs the attacking enemy, does the exhausted defender that defended initially vs the attacker defends again or does the second attack go unopposed?

i would say you can declare another defender but i would wait for another opinion on this

I think you could declare a new defender.  Just treat it as though it hadn't just attacked, with the restriction that the chieftained enemy has to be the next one to pick to attack.

I do not think this is correct. ... The shadow cards are revealed AFTER the the declare defender step. There is no opportunity to declare a new defender, as that step is long gone... if your character is killed in the 1st attack then the 2nd attack is undefended (baring casting feint or w/e).

 Except the enemy attacks again "after this attack", which means that it'll go through the 4 attack steps again after the first attack finishes.

yeah, but the declare defend is not part of the attack step, it is before.. it isn't saying repeat the COMBAT PHASE, just that card attacks twice.... So you declare defend, reveal shadow cards revealing the effect, the card attacks, then attacks again.... no new window to declare new blockers.

Chieftain of the Pit:

"Shadow: Attacking enemy attacks again after this attack. Deal it another shadow card for the next attack. "

Unless you go through the full attack sequence again (with declare defender being step 2), it won't resolve its own 2nd attack shadow card. Seems unlikely that's the intent.

Shadow: Wolf Rider attacks the defending player. That player may declare 1 character as a defender. Deal Wolf Rider its own Shadow cards. After combat, return Wolf Rider to the top of the encounter deck.

"Shadow: Wolf Rider attacks the defending player. That player may declare 1 character as a defender. Deal Wolf Rider its own Shadow cards. After combat, return Wolf Rider to the top of the encounter deck. "

According to the Combat phase rules, an attack is done by the enemies in the order you choose.  So, even if this shadow effect allows the enemy to attack again, you can choose to defend against a different enemy that had not yet attacked as your next attack to defend against. 

1. Choose an enemy to attack you.
2. Declare a defender(or not).
3. Reveal and resolve shadow effects for the attacking enemy.
4. Determine combat damage.

That is the basic outline of an enemy attack.

All this shadow effect really does is reset the enemy to perform another attack from everything I'm reading in the rules.

EDIT:  I just read the text of the shadow effect and he must be the next enemy to attack immediately after the current attack resolves... so I take back my comment regarding choosing the next attacker.

Well I think it'd also be a bit overpowered to be forced to be attacked again, yet it automatically be unopposed.  Unopposed attacks will kill heroes really fast.

Do treachery cards satisfy guarded objectives?  If not do you keep drawing cards from the encounter deck until you get an enemy or location to attach to it?

If an enemy is blocked and dies due to a card such as swift strike or gondorian spearman does their shadow card get revealed and resolve? How would quick strike work in this instance?

Yes, treachery cards can guard objectives.  It won't guard it for very long, but it can.

You reveal and resolve a shadow card during an enemy's attack sequence, and at no other time.

Concerning the various Trolls' excess damage and Frodo, if Frodo defends against such an attack can he turn the Troll's whole damage minus 2 (his Defense) into threat? i.e., if Cave Troll attacks and Frodo defends, does he turn the remaining 4 points of dmg into threat?

1. Yes. Per the FAQ: (1.23) Attachments: Any card that attaches to anoher card is treated as an Attachment in addition to its other card types.

2. You don't have to exhaust any characters, since it says "if able".  Since you haven't exhausted any characters due to this card, the second part of comparing and discarding would not apply, too.  Consider yourself lucky!

From the Watcher AP:

To the West-Door: What happens to Treachery cards I reveal during the 1b part of the quest? Are they discarded without resolving their effects?

Striking Tentacle: For timing purposes, do I first resolve the Forced effect and then I reveal the Shadow card dealt to it to calculate the total damage dealt by the attack?

Thrashing Tentacle: If I get unlucky, do I deal the damage to a character of mine INSTEAD or IN ADDITION to the damage I deal to the tentacle? Instead, I think, since the Forced effect looks like a substitute one to me.

Grasping Tentacle: If I get unlucky, do I nullify the damage my character with the tentacle attached would normally do? Since damage is dealt at Step 3 and the Forced effect takes place at Step 1, I tend to believe damage is nullified. Correct?

West-Door uses the word "reveal", so Treacheries will go off, as will that one location that could add +5 threat and another Tentacle.

ST: Yes, when you pick the ST to attack (step 1), you need to check for its Forced. Totally sucks when you A) reveal a Tentacle or shadow effect and B) ST has Black Uruks as its Shadow Effect = undefended + 2 more shadow cards…

TT: If you flip a Tentacle or a shadow effect, a character takes the damage, none of it go to the TT.

GT: I think the GT doesn't take any damage, it becomes an attachment and currently attachments don't take damage. I had a Warden of Healing today with 3 GTs attached to him at the end of the game. Most of the time you actually want GT to remain an attachment and in play, so it doesn't get shuffled back (increasing chances of being able to engage the Watcher and decreasing chances of either ST or TT's Forced triggering successfully). As long as it is on a unimportant ally (like Warden, attack 0, def 1 initially), who cares if he goes to att 0, def 0?

Go off = discarded?

And why is the word "reveal" so important? If memory doesn't fail me, in the HfG AP, the first two quest cards mention the word and, if Treacheries are revealed, they produce their effects. Unless the "and add it to the staging area" wording after the "reveal" part is what makes them to resolve.

Sorry, go off as in resolved.

As to "reveal":

"(1.19) Card Effects during Setup
"When Revealed" effects are resolved if the cards are
revealed during setup. A player can trigger responses
during setup, following the normal game rules. Players
cannot take Actions during setup." (FAQ, p. 4)

A card is only considered to be revealed if the card or
game effect causing the card to enter play specifically
uses a form of the word "reveal"." (p. 5)

Lots of questions:

Dreadful Gap [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/khazad-dum/dreadful-gap-kd]

1. If revealed during the Quest phase, I still resolve the phase as normal and then I proceed to the travel phase. Right?

2. Does DG become the active location instantly upon revelation? If another location was active and produced special effects for being active, do these effects seize to be at the moment DG is revealed?

Goblin Follower [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/khazad-dum/goblin-follower-kd]

3. It is revealed during the staging step of the Quest phase and it engages me. Does it still contribute its threat during the Quest phase resolution? I guess not, since engaged enemies do not contribute their threat.

Mountain Warg [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/khazad-dum/mountain-warg-kd]

4. The unofficial FAQ state that "If Mountain Warg is dealt a shadow card with an effect, but that effect is canceled for whatever reason, he was still dealt a shadow card with an effect and would not return to the staging area after it attacks". I suppose the same goes for Shadow effects that, due to specific circumstances, cannot produce effects, such as in a case where MW attacks, I defend and is dealt Black Uruks [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/khazad-dum/black-uruks-kd]as a Shadow card. In the above example, the enemy stays in the staging area. In other words, whenever MW is dealt a Shadows card with the "Shadow: . . ." wording, it stays in the staging area no matter what. Correct?

Washed Away [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/dwarrowdelf/foundations-of-stone/washed-away-fos]

5. According to its text, the following cards from the following sets comprise the new encounter deck:

Foundations of Stone: everything

Goblins of the Deep: Enemies and Treacheries

Twists and Turns: Enemies and Treacheries

Hazards of the Pit: everything (just Treacheries anyway)

Everything else is removed from the game. Right?

So:

6. If, when 2B quest is fulfilled and is followed by 3B and, at that moment, Zigil Mineshaft [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/khazad-dum/zigil-mineshaft-kd] was at the staging area, it is removed from the game. Right?

7. If, when 2B quest is fulfilled and is followed by 3B and, at that moment, Watchful Eyes [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/khazad-dum/watchful-eyes-kd] was attached to a Hero, it is discarded to be shuffled into the new encounter deck. Right?

Out of the Depths [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/dwarrowdelf/foundations-of-stone/out-of-the-depths-fos]

8. The chain symbol of Deeps of Moria is presented here instead of the torch of the Twists and Turns. This is obviously a mistake and the TaT is used just like in the previous quests (without the Cave Torch and its locations, since the 3B) and not the DoM. Correct?

Foundations of Stone rulesheet: "Creating a Staging Area"

9. If I play solo, do I need to bother with it?

Thanks.

1. Yes, but DG immediately becomes the active location and possibly switches with the former active location. So total threat in the staging area could change…
2. Yes, I think. We don't have a complete timing schedule, but a conditional game effect of the former active location will stop exactly when it isn't anymore the active location.
3. You are right. Enemies engaged witha player don't count their threat.
4. Should be correct, with one exception: The shadow card has been discarded prior flipping around (e.g. with Dawn Take You All). But I'm not 100% sure about that.
5. One additional condition for your list: For non-FoS cards, only the cards currently in the discard pile will be taken for the new encounter deck. So the actual distribution will change from game to game.
6. EDIT: Yes
7. EDIT: Yes
8. Didn't notice that, but yes, that should be just a small mistake.
9. No, not that I know. The intention in multiplayer games is that players run separate games. In solo mode, this shouldn't have any effect.

A question of timing:

A hero has Cave Torch [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/khazad-dum/cave-torch-kd] attached. He uses it to place 3 progress tokens on Branching Paths [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/khazad-dum/branching-paths-kd]. Which of the two Forced effects is resolved first? As the active (and only in solo games) player I get to choose if two effects resolve simultaneously, but, in our case, are the two effects truly resolved at the same time? It seems to me that Cave Torch's effect should be the first to resolve the moment the card exhausts and before I place the tokens on the location and then I explore the Paths and resolve its effect. Correct?

You're welcome. Re: number 5 - no, only the enemies and treacheries in the discard pile (-> previously discarded, or discarded from play by 3B) are part of the new encounter deck. But not the enemies+treacheries that have been in the encounter deck itself.

To your new timing question: Whether they should trigger simultaneously or not depends on the granularity of how fine an action is segmented… If you consider exhausting the torch, placing 3 progress and removing the location as 1 action, you may choose the order of the forced effects. If you mentally put a small break between these 3 things and look at it as 3 separate actions, you are not allowed to choose. I have no clue which is the case, we are still in need of a detailed a timing schedule for this game. But by my instincts, i would say all the things count as 1 action (since its 1 single action that set those things off), but that's a pure guess.

I think it would be logical for Cave Torch's forced effect to trigger before Branching Paths, as exhausting the Torch is the cost, and placing the tokens on Branching Paths is the effect - logically costs would come before effects. But as HP says, there isn't really a mandate in the rules at present to follow this reasoning.

Before i use to play like is happen in the same time and according to rules first player can choose the order but now i think you more right. Exhausting is cost and place tokens i effect. 100% sure is should be play in this order.

Good day to you.

After several months away from the game I 've just replayed the Into the Pit scenario. A question arose:

The Bridge of Khazad - Dum dictates that, while it's the active location, players cannot play cards. I 've always assumed that it included all cards, even events. They too are "played" after all. The wording in Vilya however is somewhat confusing; it makes a distinction between "play" and "put into play", much like in the AGoT card game. Having that game as a guide, whenever I use Vilya in the planning phase, I treat the revealed card as "played", whereas in all other phases, I treat it as "put into play". With the above in mind, I believe that, even though the Bridge is the active location, I can still use Vilya and put a card into play, provided I do this in any other phase save the planning one.

Am I correct here?

Play means the card must enter play from your hand. But that doens´t explain the wording on Vilya.

From the FAQ:

(1.16) The phrase “put into play” If a card effect uses the phrase “put into play,” it means that the card enters play through a card effect instead of through the normal process of paying resources and playing the card from hand. “Put into play” effects are not considered to be playing the card, and will not trigger any effects that refer to a card being played. “Put into play” will, however, trigger any effects that occur when a card “enters play”.

That's what I meant. Didn't explain myself that good.

But why the strange wording on Vilya??

Ok, so Vilya is unaffected by the quest, no matter which phase I opt to use it. Right?

Alright wanting to join in on this,
1) with Eleanor as a hero, she says "discard that card and relpace it with the next card from the encounter deck" when exhausting to cancel a treachery, so doe that mean it is not technically "revealed" ? This seems to make her awefully powerful.

2) The rule book near the end offers a house rule to avoid using shadow cardswhen introducing the game to new people. I was wondering if anyone had any input on how much this takes away from the game.

3) Surge and doomed resolves at any time shown not only "when revealed" right?

1. Bad wording, the new card is also revealed. FAQ 

2. Never tried it.

3. Yes

Thanks for all the answers. Another question:

Behind Strong Walls [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/heirs-of-numenor/behind-strong-walls-hon]

While seeming awesome at first sight for powerful defenders to defend twice, when would it be the appropriate action window to actually use it? I fail to find one.

It never really happened to use UC for defending twice. And I still see no open window for using the Event effectively. What am I missing here? The two Action windows I see in the rules chart are either too early (the first) or too late (the last).

This is a common mistake I see. The chart is sometimes misleading to people. The 'resolving attacks against you' part of the phase is green which according to the chart key means "you can take actions generally, or between the game steps stated in the rules".  And then if you go to page 18 in the rulebook for the Combat Phase stuff, and under 'Resolving Enemy Attacks' it says "When resolving enemy attacks, the players follow these 4 steps, in order. Players may play event cards and take actions at the end of each step". The four steps it then lists are: 1. Choose an enemy 2. Declare a defender 3. Resolve shadow effect 4. Determine combat damage.

Of which you can play event cards and take actions at the end of each one. So there's actually quite a few places you can use Unexpected Courage and Behind Strong Walls during this part of the Combat Phase.

I think the chart just kind of needs redone because they don't show all of the steps of combat written out, the color code is sometimes missed, and they use the phrase 'step' confusingly in the chart description.

Happy new year to all; peace, prosperity and whatever you desire.

A question about timing:

I played the FoS adventure and, at one point, The Shivering Bank [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/dwarrowdelf/foundations-of-stone/below-the-mines-the-shivering-bank-fos] quest dictated to reveal 2 cards from the encounter deck and add them to the staging area. Those two were Deep Deep Dark [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/dwarrowdelf/foundations-of-stone/deep-deep-dark-fos] and Durin's Axe [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/dwarrowdelf/foundations-of-stone/durins-axe-fos], both of which feature Surge. What I did step-by-step was:

1. Revealed both DDD and DA simultaneously and put them to the staging area.

2. Since DDD was the first of the two, I resolved its surge keyword. Then, its "when revealed" part (the card that came up with the surge was a Nameless).

3. I resolved DA's surge keyword.

Was I correct in the step order?

And another question, since too many months have passed since I last played the game and memory is getting rusty:

If, during the quest phase, I put more progress tokens than those needed to beat the quest and a new quest is instantly revealed, any extra progress tokens put in the previous quest just disappear and do not carry over to the new one, right?

No. The first card was DDD and you resolve "When Revealed" effects first, then you resolve the surge, which brings Durins Axe, you resolve DA Surge and it would bring the nameless enemy. That would conclude the first draw, then you draw the second card.

## 78 [Serazu on January 1, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57960-a-few-question-from-a-beginning-player/?do=findComment&comment=741418)

You must be right about the "two cards" thing, since logic dicates that firstly the first card enters play (triggering all there is to trigger) and then the second one follows (much like in the AGoT LCG). But are you absolutely sure that the "When revealed" part of DDD takes precedence over its surge? The rules state that the surge should come last, but the faq state that

"Surge, Doomed, and Guarded keywords should be resolved any time the card on which they occur enters play, including during setup".

Doesn't this mean that the surge should be resolved the monent the card enters play? Unless the purpose of the above passage was just to inform players that the surge always takes place and has nothing to do with timing - as far as timing goes, we stick to the original rules where surge comes last.

Thanks.

The FAQ entry you quoted just clarifies that those keywords should be resolved during setup, too.  Regarding the timing, we should stick to the rulebook and resolve the "when revealed" effect first then the keywords.

Thank you for the answers. This question was left unanswered though:

And another question, since too many months have passed since I last played the game and memory is getting rusty:

If, during the quest phase, I put more progress tokens than those needed to beat the quest and a new quest is instantly revealed, any extra progress tokens put in the previous quest just disappear and do not carry over to the new one, right?

And a few more question, concerning the SaF adventure, which I just played for the first time:

1. The Rear Guard: Since I beat the "Nearing the Gate" quest during the quest phase, I instantly revealed TRG. Since, during that victorious quest phase, I had used a hero and the phase was not over yet, I used TRG's Forced effect at the end of it and placed the 4 tokens on the quest. Was I legitimized to do it?

2. Even if Durin's Bane is at full health or, at least, in more than 0 hp, I may still beat the above quest and proceed to the next one, as long a I place 16 tokens on it. Correct? The text in bold is just a "boon", if I manage to reduce TDB to 0 hp.

3. What happens in the highly unlikely scenario where I manage to banish TDB via the DP, but I 've yet to put the 1 token needed on the "Last Lord of Moria"? Does the game go on till I put the token on it?

Right, they don´t  carry over.

1. Yes

2. Yes

3. I play it that way. There was some discussion about it and I can´t remember if there was a clear ruling from FFG.

Another question, concerning Peril and Pelargir and the abomination named Collateral Damage (which cost me a game btw just before questing to victory):

What happens if one of the initial 2 cards drawn from the encounter deck is another CD? Technically, those 2 cards hit the discard pile, so there would be another CD in it, the one just drawn. Do I discard an additional 2 cards then? To give you an example, let's say that a CD is in my discard pile and I draw another CD. I resolve its effect, which calls for discarding 2 cards from the encounter deck plus another 2 for the CD already in my discard pile. So I get to discard 2 + 2 cards. Among those 2 + 2 cards another CD is drawn. Since it hits the discard pile as well, do I draw another 2 cards for a total of 2 + 2 + 2? And another + 2 if another CD is drawn and discarded? 

And some more concerning Pickpocket’s shadow effect; since objectives attached are considered attachments, may I opt to discard the scroll and return it to the staging area? May I also discard the Local Trouble condition with his effect? I admit that thematically it doesn’t make sense for a pickpocket to steal conditions, but since no distinction is made in his text, may I use his effect to my benefit to get rid of LT?

As the card is worded I think you must discard 2 cards and if one is a CD it will count for the additional cards. So 2+4 in your example.

 I guess "his attachments" means attachments controlled by that player. And if that is the case you can/must discard the scroll but it 

would not affect local trouble.

As fas as CD is concerned, I believe we 're saying the exact same thing. As for the attachments, what you say makes sense.

Some new questions:

In Peril in Pelargir 3B quest card, the first enemy to hit the staging area immediately attacks the scroll bearer.

1. Is he dealt a shadow card?

2. May the bearer opt not to defend the attack? Let's say for instance that the bearer is Frodo who can choose to avoid the damage anyway.

Concerning the Durin's Bane attack in SaF 3B quest card:

3. Is he dealt a shadow card?

Regarding Harbor Thug's Shadow effect, let's say that I opt to defend its attack with a character other than the one who has the scroll. That character has a Defense 2. Does the Thug damage the scroll bearer for 1 (the defender counted its Def anyway), 3 (the Thug does all its damage to the bearer) or 3 - the bearer's Def damage? I think that the first instance is the correct one.

## 90 [GrandSpleen on January 20, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57960-a-few-question-from-a-beginning-player/?do=findComment&comment=750636)

Resolve the attack normally as if damage were going to be placed on the character who is actually defending.  Then place the actual damage tokens on the character with the scroll, instead.

Example: if attack 3 is, and Aragorn defends (2 def), there is 1 resulting damage.  Harbor Thug's shadow effect causes you to place that 1 damage on the hero with the scroll, even if that hero is Dain or Beregond, who have more defense.
