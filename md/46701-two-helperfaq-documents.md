# [Two helper/FAQ documents](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46701-two-helperfaq-documents/)

## 1 [kirkbauer on May 12, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46701-two-helperfaq-documents/?do=findComment&comment=467515)

I have created these unofficial reference guides covering commonly-missed rules as well as unofficial FAQs and clarifications.  If you have ideas for additions, disagree with something, find any errors, etc, please contact me directly or reply to this post with supporting documentation.  I plan to update these as official FAQs come out as well as when expansions are available.

Good work.   The problem with the FAQ thread is that it has become too big as people have hijacked it to ask silly questions :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I was going to suggest scrapping it and started a new FAQ thread, but the same would happen.

## 3 [kirkbauer on May 12, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46701-two-helperfaq-documents/?do=findComment&comment=467538)

 Agreed.  Also, my goal was to combine FAQs from here and Boardgamegeek, and to make it quick to look up each card by number and see whatever notes, FAQs, and tips were out there.

Definitely a good idea to combine the FAQs, and great work on these!  I originally noticed them on BGG, and they're very handy references.

 Great work! This is extremely useful. Although, I do have to say that now I know Ufthak's first attack is at 5 rather than 3, I must cry myself to sleep tonight.

## 6 [Paul Grogan on May 13, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46701-two-helperfaq-documents/?do=findComment&comment=467751)

I'm still not convinced by that rule on Ufthak

I've now played the second scenario, where I came across the card: Wargs:  Forced: If Wargs is dealt a shadow card with no effect, return Wargs to the staging area after it attacks

So... If the 'after it attacks' actually happens literally immediately after it attacks, then, erm... Wargs declare as attackers and then run back to staging area.  Not right.   So, in this case "after" must mean after the attack has resolved.

I'm going to play the chieftan the same way for now.   The big discussion about the beastmaster who gets an additional card "after it attacks" - I'm pretty sure this is incorrect and the card should say "when".

Cant wait for the official FAQ - until then, we'll just make it up and argue about it! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I still think that will change in the official FAQ.

The card has been translated differently in German, to make it clear that its only after he attacks once does he get the resource token....FFG haven't actually confirmed it adds in the first round yet, have they?

Zambo on BGG said it was the proper interpretation, but that is not official.  I'd like to see it confirmed in the FAQ for sure.

 Great job, but I don't like the way you explained Dunhere's power (at least if I got it correctly).

As I read the card, after you announce that only Dunhere will be attacking, you can decide to have him attack creatures in the staging area. So, to use his powers, nobody else can attack at all in this turn.

As you wrote your explanation, it seems that you can have Dunhere attack creatures in the staging area with a +1 while others attack engaged creatures (i,e, as the "only" meant 'the only one attacking creatures in that staging area")

Each attack is a separate occurence anyway. So have Dunhere attack to the staging area and then whoever else you want to use to attack attacks the engaged enemies. It is not like Magic where everything attacks all at once.

Forgive me. I did just read the rules and didn't have the chance to play the game yet. *blush*

So I wrongfully assumed all attacks happened at the same time. sonrojado.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sonrojado.gif]

In your QuickRef document you stated that for green zone :

Player Actions allowed at any time (before, during, after)

 

Please can you give a source of this "rulling" or is it your interpretation?

## 13 [kirkbauer on May 13, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46701-two-helperfaq-documents/?do=findComment&comment=468050)

 I got it from this thread, specifically Zambo saying you can play Steward of Gondor, use it to collect 2 resources, and then immediately spend those, all during the single green box on the turn order chart.

Thank you.

And you have made a great job with your FAQ.

Do you have the German text available?

EDIT: Better yet, do you have the German for both Ufthak and Dol Goldur Beastmaster?

## 16 [mason240 on May 14, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46701-two-helperfaq-documents/?do=findComment&comment=468235)

 Perhaps we can set up the page at Google Docs [http://docs.google.com], make it public, and give a few people access to edit it in the future.

## 17 [Mestrahd on May 14, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46701-two-helperfaq-documents/?do=findComment&comment=468364)

I thought these two documents were well done, even if unofficial. I looked at them after I had posted a couple questions, lol. I think I'm going to have the turn sequence chart printed in color somehow because it looks very helpful. Can't wait for the official OCR though. Great job to hold us over in the meantime!

Candacis explains it on the first page of this thread...

 Thanks. Yes, the German makes it pretty clear that you don't add the resource marker until after Ufthak has resolved his first attack, and you give the Beastmaster the second Shadow card before resolving its attack. This is the most intuitive way to make sense of the two cards, and indeed the way I suspect most of us have been playing with them.
