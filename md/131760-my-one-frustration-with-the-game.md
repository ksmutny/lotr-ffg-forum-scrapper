Heroes seem so underpowered to me.  In the books the main characters can kill tons of enemies seemingly single-handedly, but in this game Legolas(as an example) has the same attack and defense value as a generic warg.  The only difference is that he has one more hit point.  I just feel like the heroes are so un-heroic and weak.

 

I enjoy the game.  I appreciate that it is very challenging.  Sometimes I just want my heroes to cut a swath through my enemies, but I cannot seem to make that happen.

Use hero Beorn ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] lol

 

but seriously yeah the heroes basically always have worse stats than enemies which seems lame but thats the only way the game can be balanced otherwise enemies aren't a challenge. There certainly are some heroes who can smash through enemies though especially if they get the right attachments- Eomer and Boromir come to mind.

Just wait until you get a full card pool.  Then go back to some of the early quests.  It just takes a couple of cards and a couple of resources to get Legolas, Haldir, and Eomer attacking for 7+ with abilities to take out multiple enemies per round.

Over the course of a good game, those wargs will score maybe zero kills while Legolas will score a dozen or so.  If you're only basing your opinion on a straight up numerical comparison, you are in for some severe disappointment with this game.  If you can take a step back and look at the whole experience, you might just have a much better time of it.   :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

What attachments would you need to make boromir and legolas attack 7?

Massive elf fan and wouldn't mind making an elf inspired deck, kinda made a gondor deck with boromir in so would come in hand. The only good attachment I have for him is a ranger bow with will do damage to an enemy in the staging area when exhausted.

Do not stick to numericals but at the whole picture. When Legolas has 3 str and a stray goblin 3 str as well, I do not treat their str as equal. In my mind (and I dare say that this is the correct approach), the stray goblin does not represent just a goblin, but rather a whole unit of stray goblins who add their respective str to reach the number 3 to be on par with Legolas. When Legolas kills a Goblin Swordsman, he didn't kill just a goblin, but he dispatched a whole unit of them.The same goes with bosses (the unique enemies). A john doe's str might exceed Gandalf's, but I never consider that particular john doe to be stronger that Gandalf. As a boss, it probably has a whole retinue with it to support it. All of them add their str, hence they might surpass Gandalf's. Strength in numbers.

 

On a similar note, the same can be said about mounts for instance: how can a hero ride two different mounts and enjoy the benefits of both of them at the same time (because, if he enjoyed their benefits at different times, that would have been normal - a knight for example didn't have just one horse when he went to war)? Well, I treat it mostly as "he rides just one horse, but that one horse is much better than the average one". If Legolas has two Rohan Warhorses attached for instance, he doesn't jump from one to the other (though Jackson's film obviously disagrees). It just means that the particular warhorse Legolas is riding, is better than the usual Rohan warhorses. When Eomer has both Firefoot and Rohan Warhorse attached, he just rides Firefoot, but at that particular day (the one that the quest takes place), Firefoot is on steroids. And so on. Though, to be fair, I'd like a rule addition that limits the mounts to one per hero.

 

It's really easy to see further than pure stagnant numericals.

Apart from the various weapons, there are always the Dunedain Marks which aren't restricted. I like those signals more and more. For Legolas in particular, Rivendell Bow is not restricted too, so you may combine it with restricted weapons.

Rivendell blade can also count for Legolas' attack. of course, that particular card is not a real attack bonus, but almost always it will be equal to a + 2 attack.

Serazu I love your way of thinking when it comes to this game. It's going to make my Tuesday cards night with my mate even more epic! Thanks for the deck building tips as well

Heroes underpowered... Stop smoking crack.

I'm also a huge elf fan, the new cycle has been really good for that. Here is the deck I have been using based around the Silvan theme. It's best at ranged attacks and supporting questing over the course of the game so works best multiplayer and paired with some sort of defense based deck. It's not a perfect deck, I still have tweaking to do, but I hope it helps you with your own deck.

These two decks both work really well together and are almost purely elven themed and populated.
