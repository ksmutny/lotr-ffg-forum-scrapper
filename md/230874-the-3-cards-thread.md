I want to open a friendly thread. I explain:

 

There are some webs that comment new cards (for example, TftC, or even this forum...) but there is not any exact order, or the reader need to read a lot of paragraphs.

How about if you could display your thinks in just 3 words? It will be fast to read all the comments, and you could comment your thinkings fast too.

 

This is why i say it is a friendly thread. Sometimes i will post the news spoilers, and people can comment them with just 3 words. Just telling the name of 3 cards (well, it is allowed to post a PD short, if someone wants, but not necessary). 3 cards can give the readers a lot of thinkings..., and it is friendly.

 

Let's go! To start i will show 2 cards for examples, you can comments them (with just 3 name of cards ^^):

The 3 cards i name are:

1. Straigth Shot

2. Rivendel Blade

3. Hands Upon the Bow

 

It gives you a lot of ideas, isn't? Dont tell which... just think and write 3 cards more cards (if you want to repeat some it is ok, why not)
