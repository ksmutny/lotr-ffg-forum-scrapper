Has anyone noticed that the threat on the hero cards in the last few packs has been very dark compared to previous sets? Mirlonde and Pippin in particular I find it difficult to read the number. It used to be much lighter against the dark background. Does anyone know why it changed?

My own theory is that it was done to annoy me in particular :ph34r: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_ph34r.png]

What? How is a color cheaper? I mean, I get it in other circumstances, but it's not like they don't have professional printers that can print any color scheme. How is removing a tiny dissolving speck of a lighter shade of blue in a tiny number saving them money? It's like saying a book editorial can't afford to print the letter N because it costs too much.

 

Anyway, I've noticed it too, and I think that it's some change they decided to make for some unknown reason. At first i thought it could be a misprint but we know it isn't.

Yes the colours have a different prices......The quality of the last print of lotr cards is less then previous. Quite simple.

The quality of printing affects the whole product, not just a tiny bit of it in the corner. Plus it has a lot to do with the quality of the material also. Besides, we know it's not a printing defect since the previews and online images of the cards show this new coloring of the number also.

too dark...

Way too dark. Guess that's what they meant with "Against the Shadow"...

Correction. No colours are more expensive than others. It all comes down to how many colours you wanna use. 2 is the cheapest (black and white), then comes 4 colours (any of your choice) and then the whole pallet. In this case it won't effect the printing price since they already use the most "expensive" choice. My guess is that it's quiet possible a mistake. I say that based upon many years of experience working with layout, colours and printing. The mistake is quiet possible one of two.

1. The color calibration could be slightly off and needs to be recalibrated. (Or it has been slightly off and finally been calibrated :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] ) Also under this category is the possibility that someone have suddenly used another colour offset or template.

2. It could be that by accident they have used a RGB colour code instead of CMYC. RGB is the colours you see on the monitor where as CMYC is the printing colours. So if I mess around in RGB and find a nice colour and then print it, it won't be exactly the same as I see it on screen. It will be a colour printed in CMYC.

Regardless the reason for the mistake, the reason they have continued to use the colour is to maybe at least make on season match.

Of cause there's a 3rd possibility that they just thought "hey let try something new".

The funny part is regardless if it's an error or deliberate it's interesting that no one has noticed or done anything about it in the test printing phase. Maybe they have had some students or substitutes that didn't notice ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

One of two things is definitely gonna happen. 1. Either they'll continue with this colour until they change their minds. Or 2. they will continue with this colour out the AtS cycle and then do something about it.

What a rambling about something less important :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
