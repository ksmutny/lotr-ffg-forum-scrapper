The retail cost of all these sets was over $800 and I am asking $600 + shipping.  I want to sell them as a whole so I'm not willing to break it up.  This would be a quick and easy way to get into the game and be nearly all caught up all at once!

 

If interested, please contact me at: rborkowitz@gmail.com

 

Thanks!

Honestly mate you'd have better luck selling them piecemeal. Maybe each cycle as a whole. Anybody who needs that full of a collection just started the game and probably not willing to jump in feet-first for $600 on everything; and anyone willing to is probably already well caught up on releases.

IIRC this is your second post on the matter, which means you had no luck the first time around. Yeah it's a minor inconvenience packaging and going to the post office repeatedly, but if people are willing to reimburse for shipping costs, you'd offload these much much faster.

May I repeat my offer of just the LOTR Saga boxes?

Rob, are you still looking for a buyer for your collection?
