I am sure this has been discussed left right centre but I can still stop wondering.

As I said elsewhere I have been doing mostly coop until recently. I have utilized Beravor, Dunhere, Eowyn solo deck that has been doing rather well. Yesterday (without any stalling) I have completed the Journey Down the Anduin with the final score of -1 (15 Threat, 1 Damage, 17 Victory points).

But then the Escape from Dol Guldur. What happened to the scaling on this one? In a 2 player game, on the first round, you get normally 5 encounter cards (3 setup plus 2 staging) for 5 remaining heroes. In a solo game you get 4 encounters (3 set up - AGAIN! - plus 1 staging) for 2 remaining heroes. Does this make any sense, dear designers? To whom I thank for creating such a great game. However, this has really not worked very well as the difficulty is totally different for different number of players.

I have played five games and once I got to the Nazgul, never further.

Others?

The third quest escape form Dol-Guldur is not design to play solo. This quest for 2 and more players. But even that way is still to easy. I play many tmies with my  friend and never lose.  actually we dont lose solo game either. we need some new quests and encounter as quick as possible. Otherwise i start to look already for  Midlle earth ccg. Yes is old game but looks very interesting.

The old game is very interesting, at least in its original "Wizards" form.  I'm afraid I never really liked the attempt to take it into "Playing the bad guys" and ICE eventually over-complicated the whole concept.   But FFG forgive me if I see some lineage between the current game and the old ICE product.  Oh, the games are completely different, but I still get some funny twinges of nostalgia from as I read the rules to the LCG.
