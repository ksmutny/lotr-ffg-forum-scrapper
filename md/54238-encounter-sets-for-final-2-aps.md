Does anyone have any inside information on the encounter sets used for the final 2 adventure packs?

I assume so, yes.  Alas, I am not one of them.

 I'd like to order some individual sets of encounter cards so that I can keep my separate encounter decks pre-assembled, thus reducing set-up time for the rest of my life.

I already have 2x Core set, an another Core set on the way.  But I know for a fact that I need at least a couple more sets of Orcs.

I assume that "Return to Mirkwood" is going to use Spiders of Mirkwood, so I'll need an extra set of them, too.

But what are we going to need for Dead Marshes?  Wilderlands?  Sauron's Reach?

And what else for Return to Mirkwood?  ???

It would save me shipping costs if I could order them all together.  Otherwise, I guess I'll order the 2x Orcs soon, and the rest when I know what they are.

If anyone knows, you could PM me and I could keep it a secret for the sake of those who like the surprise.

Thanks!

If you find out, let me know. I'm looking to do exactly the same thing!

I have not ordered any yet, but they are available at www.toywiz.com for sure.

 The final 2 Mirkwood quest scenarios will probably be cranked up to Difficulty 11 just so no one can claim they are too easy. Each will have just 1 quest card that reads: "During Setup, reveal the entire encounter deck and add it to the staging area. Good luck."

"Why not just make 10 harder?"

"Yes, but this one goes to 11."
