If your like me and can't remember every character and location name in Tolkien's middle-earth, but you would like to see the connection between his work and the lotr card game, then your in luck.

Some of you may already be familiar with these resources, Tolkien's world from a-z by Robert Foster and The Atlas of middle-earth by Karen Wynn Fonstad.

These are excellent resources for bringing more lotr lore to your gaming experience.  If your wondering about who characters like Beregond or Erestor were in the novels, or would like maps of Moria, or find out where locations like cair andros were, then get these books.

Strangely, I can't find any information on the two heroes Eleanor and Beravor.  Does any one know anything about them, or are they just made up by FFG?

i'd also be curious to know if there are any other resources worth checking out.

I've enjoyed the atlas a bit (I actually bought it before I read the books, since geography has always interested me). It's a very useful reference when reading and is exceedingly helpful for visualizing distances of journeys, developments in battle, etc. It is definitely worth purchasing for a fan (and a lot of the info/maps/images can't readily be had on the internet, so still useful).

I started writing a thread about the lore linked with the releases (a little bit like richsabre's excellent thread), I really should expand it now lol -

I would like to see a pronunciation guide to many of the name and places.

@shipwreck- i do like tolkiengateway, though personally i would recommend encylopedia of arda if someone has to choose an internet site…

as with any research i would warn people that many sites on tolkien merely get their info from other sites and books which often arent cross referenced…and often wrong. (yes- i include my own series in this!)

this is even true for books however, as when researching for some of my own chapters, i have found material that differs from the books themselves…..my personal encylopedia i own had the date of birth wrong for ellandanelrohir, so i guess it works for both books and internet sites.

if in doubt id always recommend to try and find them in the actual books themselves first

@timbolton - thanks for the compliment :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

@rfox01 - this can be found in the appendices on the trilogy

These points are of course true.  Specifically, Tolkien contradicts himself in his own works, famously in the number of balrogs (but on many other points) in his development of Arda, chronicled in 12 volume series The History of Middle-earth, Unfinished Tales, and The Silmarillion, The Children of Hurin.  Which version of events is the "real one" cannot be decided, although it is debated, and I feel it should be the version that resonates the most with the individual reader.  So, when someone says "but Tolkien says…" you don't necessarily have to take it as the final word.

good point, though i guess it depends on where your boundary lies on what to take as tolkiens final word…..tricky given that the versions of his work were later edited.

i have met tolkien 'loreists' (a word?) who will only accept the words in the actual stories themselves as first hand sources…..the history series, even unfinished tales, are out of it.

i personally like to use the history series as there is alot of great info in there, especially when trying to decipher distances and map places…something which is an example of where you say tolkien contradicts himself…often because his got christopher to make the maps for him
