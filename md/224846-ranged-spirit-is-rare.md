When a player ask me for what i need, or what me want to play him.... i almost always say: willpower + ranged.

Curious, nobody has that kinda of deck.

 

Now the problem is solved: Lanwyn. She can be on a pure quester deck, and she can help me with the ranged trait.

 

I'm very happy!

However, i feel rare: spirit ranged..., it sounds rare. Isn't? What you think?

 

 

Tactics is the ranged keyword for excelence, ... probably leadership is right too..., lore as much... but, spirit? spirit is just the oppositive sphere against tactics.

She is the only Ranged in Spirit. Unless you run multisphere or A Good Harvest and attach Dunedain Cache or Rivendell Bow.

Ranged spirit is not rare, it's unique right now.
