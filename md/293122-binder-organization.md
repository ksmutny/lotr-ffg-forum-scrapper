Now that I've been able to fill in some gaps in my collection due to the reprints I'm having a quandary about how to organize everything in the binder. Assuming you separate by sphere in your binder do most of you guys organize in alphabetical order or by set release within each sphere? It's just that with so many cards if you get a new pack you have to take out a bunch of cards to get the new ones in there if you sort alphabetically but if you sort by set release then it's harder to find stuff when deck building. Thanks in advance!

For me after separating by sphere I divide the cards by type (allies, attachments, events, side quests), then I sort by cost and finally inside each cost group by alphabetic order.

## 3 [mttrchrds on March 31, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/293122-binder-organization/?do=findComment&comment=3663686)

Sphere -> Type (i.e. hero, ally, attachment, event) -> Trait (i.e. Silvan, Dwarf)

One of these has more than enough space for a whole sphere (not cheap but the quality is superb): https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B071V91LGC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 [https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B071V91LGC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1]

Based on card type numbers and 18 spaces on each page (2 sided) I use the following:

- First 2 pages for Heroes
- Next 4 pages for Allies
- Next 4 pages for Events
- Remaining pages for Attachments

The folders are are big enough to put Neutral sphere at the back of one of them.

I have a separate solution for encounter cards.

I guess it depends how you go about building decks. If you use ringsdb [https://ringsdb.com/] then it makes sense to use one of the sorting options available there.

My choice, if I had enough cards to have a problem like that, would be to sort by pack. Put a pack into a sheet of pockets, and inserting missing ones is easy.

## 5 [Durins_Father on March 31, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/293122-binder-organization/?do=findComment&comment=3663709)

I sort the cards in 5 binders, one for each sphere + Neutral/heroes/Baggins/Fellowship. I sort the cards on type first (Allies/Events/Attachments/Side-quests), then on descending cost, and then in chronological order. I made a video a while ago when I had all my cards up to Withered Heath in the binders before I rebuilt my decks: https://www.dropbox.com/s/x5w95fux8wlyo0o/Full%20Binders%20until%20Withered%20Heath.mp4?dl=0 [https://www.dropbox.com/s/x5w95fux8wlyo0o/Full%20Binders%20until%20Withered%20Heath.mp4?dl=0]

To those wanting to share their storage solutions, feel free to send an article with some pictures to me, and I'll get it up on the Storage Hub on Vision of the Palantir: https://visionofthepalantir.com/storage-hub/ [https://visionofthepalantir.com/storage-hub/]

My binder organization:

First) Divide by spheres

Second) Divide by type (ally/attachment & side-quest/event)

Third) Divide by cost.

That's it -- I don't worry about ordering for same cost/type/sphere cards, because at nine per page it's easy to find what I want -- and it makes it easier when adding new cards not to have to move any existing cards around.  If a given cost expands beyond a page I just add a new one.

All my heroes are kept together in a single deck, sorted by sphere and then alphabetically.

Encounter cards/quests are kept in card boxes (one per cycle).  I keep the quest card followed by setup cards, followed by cards unique to that quest.  All shared cards are kept together, and I use plastibands to keep the cards together.

The one tweak I want to do is to replace my two large player card binders with five smaller binders for the four spheres plus neutral/saga.

## 7 [Wandalf the Gizzard on March 31, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/293122-binder-organization/?do=findComment&comment=3663923)

I divide by sphere, then type, then release order. When I fill out my collection, I'll probably switch to sphere/type/category (traits, deck type, etc.). One Ultra Pro nine-pocket binder fits cards up through the end of Against the Shadow cycle. My encounter and quest cards are stored in a Hobby Lobby artist case with Broken Token insert.

## 8 [sappidus on March 31, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/293122-binder-organization/?do=findComment&comment=3663964)

For player cards, I store my heroes in a separate small binder. The rest are just in chronological order (which RingsDB can helpfully sort by).

I like that for the vast majority of releases, there's 9 player cards to precisely fill a 3x3 binder page. Also, the knowledge that I'll never have to reorganize the cards; just add new binders as needed. And flipping through them is essentially tracing through the release history of the game.

(Some say that building decks is harder with a chronological system. Perhaps, but I'm so used to it after all these years, and it's actually helped my knowledge of the card pool.)

Does this binder fit sleeved cards?

## 10 [Vince79 on April 7, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/293122-binder-organization/?do=findComment&comment=3670346)

I had no idea so many people kept the cards in binders.  Seems like they would get damaged constantly being taken in and out of the pages.  I figured most people kept them in boxes, individually sleeved.  

And I'll echo Albershide's question:  Does this binder fit sleeved cards?

## 11 [dalestephenson on April 7, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/293122-binder-organization/?do=findComment&comment=3670362)

I generally play a number of quests with essentially the same deck, so cards are infrequently being taken in and out of the pages.  I haven't noticed any damage.  I don't sleeve, but if I did I would only sleeve the cards I took out to form my deck, not keep the entire collection of player cards sleeved.  Much cheaper.

## 12 [Wandalf the Gizzard on April 7, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/293122-binder-organization/?do=findComment&comment=3670514)

Cards go in and out of my binder for nearly every other game, with no significant wear yet. Using boxes is at first the better approach, but soon you’ll have so many cards that deck building becomes painful; flipping through endless stacks looking for three specific cards. And then when you decide you only needed two-of . . . You get the picture.

Okay, I can see that.

But again, does the binder fit sleeved cards?

I cannot speak to the specific binder linked by mttrchrds, but all binders with built-in pages that I personally have encountered have pockets that accommodate (at least) 3x single-sleeved cards each, though some get snug if the sleeves are thick enough.

This includes Ultra Pro, Ultimate Guard, and Dex Protection brands. Note, however, that loading 3x cards into all pockets on both sides of every single page may not be tenable, depending on the specific model. (Whether it has a soft or hard cover is the essential factor.)

Similarly, all card pocket binder pages meant to go into a 3-ring binder that I've encountered also hold (at least) 3x single-sleeved cards per pocket.

I ended up ordering these:

https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07F83JT23/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 [https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07F83JT23/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1]

 

In the description they state that they fit sleeved cards. What's great about these is that they are black, double sided and you get 50 separate pages which is a place for 900 cards. The separate page thing is a huge benefit, giving you great flexibility adding new cards without having to rearrange everything. At this point this won't fit my collection but it's very easy to add more sheets to it.

 

And I ordered this to hold them:

If you are in the US you can get some really fancy LOTR themed binders like these:

Well, the Ultra Pro nine-pocket binder I use does.

Those are bad!  Well, many of them, anyway.

Too bad they aren't the zip up kind that mttrchrds talked about.

I can confirm that this binder fits sleeved cards. I use Ultra Pro Standard (matte) for my player and hero cards and I can fit 3 in each pocket.

The official FF grey sleeves are a much more snug fit (being a little larger than UP Standard) - not as easy to get in and out.

They are great binders, highly recommended.

I’m currently putting everything in binders. One question I’ve is what you do with the cards from the collectors edition. Like f.e. Steward of Gondor, do you place them with the one of the core set?

## 20 [Wandalf the Gizzard on May 24, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/293122-binder-organization/?do=findComment&comment=3708321)

I think it depends on how many Core Sets you have.

One and then the Collector’s edition

## 22 [Wandalf the Gizzard on May 25, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/293122-binder-organization/?do=findComment&comment=3708434)

Then yes, I'd put the Collectors Edition cards with the normal copies of the same card. Of course, if that brought me up to four or more copies, I'd probably store the extras in a different way.

Hi mate!

Here: https://boardgamegeek.com/images/boardgame/all/page/3?username=aliprandifabio [https://boardgamegeek.com/images/boardgame/all/page/3?username=aliprandifabio]

You can find my idea of "Storage Hub".

I used:

- Wine boxes for Cards storage

- Dragon Shield perfect size + Dragon Shield Clear Matte

- 2 Ultra-Pro Binder (black&brown)

- 1 leather playmat, self-made

- Legion dices + Casino dices

 

I've found a large amount of these on Amazon. Otherwise, you can find them in every Comic Store, if able.

Woha! Very nice. Are these wine boxes from bought (and shipped) bottles or can you order them separately on e.g. Amazon?

 

On topic / above questions:

I do not use binder(s), because that would take up to much space. I have the cards in a box. Player cards: They are sorted alphabetically, but devided by sphere and type. Encounter: Sorted by sets, in release order.

## 25 [aliprandifabio on May 29, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/293122-binder-organization/?do=findComment&comment=3710646)

Hi mate! Thanks for your appreciations!

About the boxes, I bought them on Amazon.it without wines. I think that these will be on Amazon.us/uk.

There a lot of industries that only create empty wooden boxes. Before the purchase I asked about the space between separators.

About binder(s), the question is subjective: I prefer to put them into a Binder, divided by Sphere - Hero/Event/Attachment.

About the Encounter decks, I took out only 2-3 scenarios/time and I put them into the small wine-box, with Player decks/dices/tokens, as you can see from the images.
