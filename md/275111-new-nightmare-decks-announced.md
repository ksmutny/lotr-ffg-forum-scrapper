That Jagged Cavern makes Protector of Lorien look good. I can't wait to see what that shark does. And Na'asiyah gets a sister!

Pretty nasty and thematic at the same time.

Right no progression until you deal with the shark.

Oh, thanks @stimpaksam [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/309009-stimpaksam/]. I only saw the art for the shark on the card fan.

This looks great! If the shark starts wrecking my board state I’m going to have a hard time not saying, “ Stop Bruce! Elves are friends not food!”

Hooray! More Nightmare decks for me to sink my teeth into. Looking forward to the Drowned Ruins one, that quest could use a bit of a difficulty bump.

I see what you did there.

I was going to make a joke about FFG jumping the shark with this nightmare expansion, but then I remembered they already made this card [https://s3.amazonaws.com/hallofbeorn-resources/Images/Cards/Heirs-of-Numenor/The-Leaping-Fish-Location.jpg] back in HoN.

Yes! These are going right now on my Christmas list.

 

If they ship before Christmas... ?

Nightmare decks are available the days FFG publish the news. So if you order them today you will have within two weeks no matter where you live in the world. If you depend to another store any delay is not FFG fault.
