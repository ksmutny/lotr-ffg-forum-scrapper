Can anyone actually see this in the store (where you can click order and it gets added to your basket)?

 

The product link should be -

 

http://store.fantasyflightgames.com/productdetails.cfm?SKU=uMEN02 [http://store.fantasyflightgames.com/productdetails.cfm?SKU=uMEN02]

 

I was planning on ordering all three of the new PODs together. If other people can't see/order it, I'll email FFG asap. Just wondering if there is something funny from my side.

It's sold out already, be quicker next time :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

There's a misprint. I daresay they are getting it sorted.

Although CoolStuffInc has it listed as out of stock. Although that could be for that very reason.

Ah, that could be it too, I was surpirsed at how fast it went out.  FYI misprint is due to a missing shadow effect on a copy of Brown Water Rats

Thats odd that only one copy of the rats is misprinted as opposed to all 3 (or 4?)

Yes it's strange that only one is wrong. And also, it can't be sold out and no need to hurry. It's print on demand which means you order and then they print it.

I was away on holiday...

And how does POD (clue in the PRINT on demand) get sold out on the official site? I can understand on an unaffiliated store who have ordered it in for themselves. Hope you are kidding me lol  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

 

Any heads up on when they will get that misprint fixed and added to store again? I'll wait to order all three together, shipping to the UK is high as it is.
