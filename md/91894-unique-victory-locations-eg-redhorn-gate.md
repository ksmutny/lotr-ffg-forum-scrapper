I just beat Redhorn Gate (on my 2nd attempt - that third quest stage caught me by surprise the first time!)

 

Anyway, I had a question about the victory locations (locations with victory points).

 

What happens if we explore the same unique location twice?  Do we put the second one in the victory pile, but not count its points?  Or do we put it in the normal discard pile?

You can explore Unique VP locations more than once. When you finish exploring one it goes to the victory display (out of play) then when you are instructed to make it the active location it re-enters play. Then when you finish it again, you add it again to the victory display.

... but you only count its victory points once?

Yes you only count your victory points once when you have won the quest at the end of the game.

I think I understand my confusion.  I was playing OCTGN and was pretty sure that I found (and explored) 2 of the same victory location.  When I look at the Redhorn Gate card list here [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/dwarrowdelf/the-redhorn-gate/] it looks like I should not have found any duplicates of those unique locations.

 

So I think one of the following happened:

 

a) Some bug in OCTGN duplicated one or more cards  (does this ever happen???)

 

b) I accidentally load the same encounter deck twice (though I doubt it)

 

c) I confused two similar 3-threat/7-progress unique locations

 

 

I wish OCTGN had a save feature so that I could find out what happened!
