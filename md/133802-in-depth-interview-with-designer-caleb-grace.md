Hey guys,

Disclaimer: It is a long interview, but you cannot put restraints on nerdery this pure.

Really cool interview, but I was so disappointed when you censored Caleb's "spoilers". The second one is obvious, but the first one ("I'm happy to confirm ******") I really REALLY want to know what it was!

I know! **** Morgul Dolphins, ruining everybody's fun...

Yeah, nobody gets that Dolphin reference.. And also, nobody believes the "I know!" :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

Sorry, do they ever discuss The Lost Realm? I've skipped through but can't find anything.

 

Also very curious about the dolphinised spoiler that made them all go "YES"! Wonder what that can be. As it's in Treason of Saruman, could it be a new hero? People have been wanting a Tactics Eowyn for ages.

Why do they even censor it if developer openly speaks about it?

We made the edits per Caleb's request. The information is in the conversation preceding the "spoiler." He checked and it was determined that the information shouldn't be released yet.

While we could have simply removed the entire question, that just wouldn't be the COTR style.

> Why do they even censor it if developer openly speaks about it?

I don't really get that either.

The one reason.I can think of is that management afterwards didn't agree with the spoilers or that the spoilers were only for the CotR themselves.

Will they be released later on? :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I think the second dolphin is obviously new Theoden, seeing that Brian asks this question and it makes sense for him to appear on the next Saga. It's the first dolphin the one i'm interested in, and I think it was a longer sentence than the actual dolphin sound.

Awesome guys, thanks for bringing this to the community!  I just got finished listening, and man...stupid dolphin.

## 12 [FallenTurtles on February 2, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/133802-in-depth-interview-with-designer-caleb-grace/?do=findComment&comment=1431916)

So just to clarify, the dolphin actually refers to the same spoiler, so it's just one card.

I did end up trimming down the amount of time a LITTLE bit, but for the most part, the dolphin sound lasts about as long as the actual mention of the card did.

 

Once the card is out, I think we can release the unedited version. It really adds almost nothing beyond the name of the card.

Really enjoyed the interview. Looking forward to the coming months of Lotr lcg goodness.

I like Dolphins. They mean there's something that's cool coming up and maybe a new spoiler article is about to show up. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Well, that will be too son. There was 3 or 4 new spoil articles recently.

Just finished listening.

First, great episode! Really shows who's working on our beloved game and tells us his story. So next time something gets delayed, you at least know that it's aalso not his fault and that he hates delays too. It ahowed his love for this game, he even played it before designing it, and how much work goes into everything. Thanks guys and thank you Caleb!

For the spoiler:

i think it went like this: "I ca tell you that [a new Theoden] will be released.

Brian:"So can you tell us when this [new version of Theoden] is coming?

Caleb:"The [new version of Theoden] is coming in the Saga expasion the Treason of Saruman.

Also I found it quite funny when Brian says :'something that they can only know if they were listening to our episode'. Brandon: 'a nugget'. Instead of that we got nothing but dolphin sound, not even dolphin meat, lol.

Have still only listened to the first 2 hours of this mammoth episode but absolutely loving it. I forget who mentioned it in the podcast but they said how things have been "different"....for the better since Caleb took over and I think possibly a good adjective would be there is a lot of transparency between the player base and the designers.  Its incredibly refreshing to hear from the design team especially in such a candid matter regarding the process of design, the individual's own fandom and thought process, etc.  I feel lucky to be a part of such a unique gaming situation. I hope Caleb and Matt will continue to have access to the community in this manner.

Excellent show, Boyos (as Brandon would say)! It's funny, I actually say boyos relatively often. I don't like Jar Jar. It's just sort of whimsical. When I first heard Brandon say it, I felt happy that someone else out there also uses it. 

 

PLEASE KEEP DOING LONG EPISODES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

 

The fact that you guys are not concerned about going 2+ hours per episode is AWESOME. I do a fair amount of commuting, and I really enjoy all of the content that you all produce. Three cheers for the longer format. Yes, number crunching and strict strategy talk are nice sometimes, but so is hearing people who love the game simply having a discussion and sharing first impressions of cards, funny stories, etc. The show has a lot of depth because you're not afraid of some free-form discussion and that really adds a warmth and personality to the show. When I listen, I feel like I am hanging out with a room full of people who also love the game and sharing insights and laughs, not simply listening to someone go over the basic factual information that a lot of review type sites/podcasts/articles do. 

 

Keep up the good work!

Part of what made this episode so entertaining is that Caleb (and the CotR guys) just come across as extremely likeable.

 

It also didn't feel like an author on a book tour trying to drum up interest in product, but rather someone talking about a genuine passion project who actually wanted to be there.  As a consumer it's always nice to see something you are passionate about be represented with the same enthusiasm from a content creators standpoint.  Although I do wish we had more players (and events) in the UK.

 

Oh and Theodon in saga box three isn't really a spoiler at this point, unlike say, the Gollum hero coming in box four. *drops mic*

While I think he said Theoden, and a new Theoden was sort of teased in the Helm's Deep quest article, what if he said Snowmane?  That would draw the same kind of reaction from the COTR crew, and would be an appropriate spoil for their show, since they've been begging for a Snowmane card since Theoden hero was released.  Here's hoping we get both in Treason of Saruman (though Snowmane has to show up by the Return of the King box). 

## 21 [GrandSpleen on February 27, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/133802-in-depth-interview-with-designer-caleb-grace/?do=findComment&comment=1467090)

Snowmane: Attach to a Rohan character.  Attached character gains +1 willpower (+2 willpower if attached character is Theoden) and a Leadership icon.

 

Response: after attached hero quests successfully, exhaust Snowmane to ready attached hero and another Rohan character.

That sounds like a very expensive card.

Kinda like an unexpected courage plus Celebrian's Stone. Mighty! I would pay a good few resources for that...

## 24 [Bullroarer Took on February 27, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/133802-in-depth-interview-with-designer-caleb-grace/?do=findComment&comment=1467801)

After exhausting Snowmane discard the top card of the encounter deck. If the card is a Nazgul discard the hero Snowmane is attached to.
