# [CardGameDB bought by FFG!](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88634-cardgamedb-bought-by-ffg/)

wow, FFG has really made a good decision here. CardGameDB is going to be slowly absorbed and intergrated directy into FFG. This is such a good decision. Card popup links, searchable card databas base, decks etc etc. All the things that a card game community should have.

 

Most important though it will consolidate the community together.

 

Great news CardGameDB is the best place for LCGs and FFG are really making the right choice here.

Call me old-fashion, but I still prefer to spend the extra time to make my decks with all the physical cards.  It's half the fun of the game for me, actually.  CardGameDB is still great for referencing cards real quick like, though.

Yeah, it is a very good reference site. And that's about it.

Still, maybe we'll get spoilers quickly, or for the people who can't get the product early after release so they can at least see the cards.

Are you serious? I only signed up to Cardgame db 2 days ago- why did I bother? :S

Good move from their point of view though.

i do use the site as reference, along wit lotrlcg. both a very good and im pleased to see this. i also build with physical cards though....i like that feel haha

I think most people build deck with real cards. Still the majority of decks posted online at ANY location.. including here is exported form cardgameDB and while the LoTR community is mainly here, most of the other games are not. I think the major changes this will bring to this game will be the ability to share and post decks directly through the site as well as have card images and popup links directly inside the posts.

I didn't even signed up to the site, I just go in and see the cards, that's it.

what is good is that you can build a deck, if someone wants advice, and then turn it directly into text to copy paste here. that is a very useful thing saving you having to type a whole list out

It will also mean that people like rich who liketo wax on about **** can host their own blogs directly on the site linked to the front page like cgdb. Popular blog posts can make it even to the news section. This will also add to the reduction of the community split. So instead of havign 500 small blogs all over the place they will be cenbtrilised on this site.. though there are independence issue now..

One of the most exciting things is that the spoilers will be up quickly from now on. No longer do I have to wait on my store to get the pack in and for them to forget to order it.
