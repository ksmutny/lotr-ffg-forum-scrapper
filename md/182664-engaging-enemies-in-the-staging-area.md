Hey folks!

 

Got a question regarding cards that allow attacking enemies in the staging area.  Is this basically a free shot at the enemy with out any retaliation from the enemy?

Yep, that's the advantage.  They only attack if they are engaged with you.

depending on when you can do it,  you might also be able to take out an enemy during the questing phase to prevent it from adding its threat.  Hands Upon the Bow, for example.

Ha! Very cool. Thanks for the tip! I'll look for that card.
