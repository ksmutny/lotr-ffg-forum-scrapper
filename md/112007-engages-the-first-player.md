If an enemy has this text on it, does this mean that every turn the enemy will engage a new player? Or does it engage once, and stay there until some card effect pushes it back to the staging area, in which case its text will make it engage the current first player?

If the text is just printed without anything before it, it's a passive ability and the enemy will 'follow' the first player token, like with Chief Turch:

If the text is preceded by "When Revealed" or some other timed event, it will only occur at the moment specified by the card, and not repeatedly without a trigger.  Like this card:

Follow up: Does Turch trigger himself? So after first player changes and he engages the new first player, does he remove a time counter? How about Son of Arnor, can he force Turch to engage a different player? If so, does Turch immediately re-engage the first player?
