Regrettably i have lost one of my newer large size clamshell packaging containers for a cycle expansion. I used to not keep the cards in them, but for various reasons i have had to change my storage solution and i am it seems one short of the new style packs. If anyone in the UK does not use them or usually chucks them away i would like to obtain one. I am happy to pay postage by paypal and add a Â£1 or so for your time.

I have loads of the smaller size packs spare but you cannot put the new size picture sheet and rules insert into the smaller ones.

I know its a long shot and maybe everyone keeps these plastic packs now but i thought i would ask and see.

Hi David

I may be able to help - I've got some AHTCG packs I don't need. PM me with the size in cm and your address and I'll see what I can do.

Jon
