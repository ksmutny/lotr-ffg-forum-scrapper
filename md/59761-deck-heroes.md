 Something just occurred to me.  When a hero died he is put into the discard pile (or am I wrong about that), so if the discard pile is shuffled back into the deck it's possible that you'll draw that hero into your hand.

 Is it possible to get that hero out of your hand and back into play?

No, the rules are very specific about this.
Your Hero is NEVER reshuffled.

There is that Spirit card that allows you to pluck a hero out of a discard pile and put it back into play, though. And doesn't one of the Eagle cards allow you to save a hero from dying, putting him back into play with one wound marker? I don't remember their names, though, sorry sonrojado.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sonrojado.gif]

Fortune or Fate (5C Spirit)

Good catch spalanzani!
