# [Collecting 3 of copies of each card from the Core Set](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/109065-collecting-3-of-copies-of-each-card-from-the-core-set/)

Is there a way to collect 3 copies of every card from the core set without having to buy 3 core sets?  Even if I buy a second core set, there will still be a handful of cards that I only have 2 of and I don't need multiple copies of the quest's or related cards either.  So, does FFG sell individual cards or does a 3rd party website out there sell individual core set cards?  I'm very thankful that FFG puts 3 copies of every card in all of the subsequent pack/sets that it sells.

 

Thanks!

I've seen some people selling copies of the 1x and 2x Core Set cards on ebay, but I'm not sure how much more cost-effective that would be versus buying a new Core Set. FFG doesn't sell individual cards, and I'm not aware of any other sites that do so. ebay is definitely your best bet.

Thanks Raven, that's sort of what I assumed.  Here's a follow up question...does anybody think that having a full 3 card core set is really that important?  I'm just starting out and I have 1x core set and then a couple of adventure packs.  I don't notice that I'm missing any core set cards when I'm playing but the completest in me is bothered by it.  

 

Thanks!

oh this is a question as old as this forum, to cut a (very) long discussion short - no, its not important, you dont need it, you dont need more than 1 to play well, but if you love this game, if you have the money, and if you are willing to have cards you will only ever have as spares (or frame as i did haha), then i would go for it :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

i played for the first 1.5 years with one core set and did fine ))

What cards are you looking for, and what do you have already? I posted a postage stamp trade [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/108290-postage-stamp-trade-core-set-2xs-for-secrecy/] a while ago, if you're interested.

Thanks for the idea.  I only have 1 core set currently so it's not that I'm looking for anything specific at the moment, I'm just thinking that I would like to get more of cards that only came as 1 or 2 of in the core set.  Also, I do not have anything extra to trade right now, i have only purchased a couple of adventure packs, none of which have been duplicates.

It is really up to you. People say they don't need multiple copies of core but many people do. I would say to truly get the most out of the game you need 2 copies and 3 if your a serious player.

If you proxy or whatever there are some great cards in core you want 3 off. Not a few but tons and not just UC or CStone. Things like test of will, gleowine.. Well, I'd be listing half the set before I'm done. The funny thing is many will say that you do not need but they themselves will own at least 2 and proxy for 3.

The good news is that as the game is older now there is a pretty steady stream of reselling going on. Keep an eye on BGG auctions, Card Game DB trades and eBay. You can usually grab a full copy of core for less than the price of a single Asylum Pack.

I would encourage you to not buy extra copies.  If you are going to play with more than 2 people, then obviously get an extra set.  Otherwise, having extra copies of all the powerful cards like Unexpected Courage only restricts your deck building.  You will find that half of your deck is comprised of those same powerful cards that you would include in every deck.  If you only buy one core set, you have to fill in a lot more cards and it lets you use a wider variety of cards.

 

If this was a competitive game you would have to buy 3 sets.  The beauty of the co-op aspect is that having only 1 set just makes the game a little more challenging, which is a good thing.

What I did was simply buy off eBay a made up package from someone containing one copy of each card in the core set you only get 2 copies of such as A test of will, Feint, Dwarven Axe, hasty stroke, Steward of Gondor, forest snare, Gondolin blade etc. I still only have one copy of all the cards in the core set that you only get one of but that's fine as most are unique anyway and id rather not run more than one copy of unexpected courage. It's like I have 1 and a half core sets or something. I find having that third copy of the 2x cards really strengthened my decks and only cost like 18 dollars or something. Definitely recommend it and can link you to what I bought which is still sold. Edited June 21, 2014 by PsychoRocka

thats the one i bought and it arrived pretty fast and in perfect condition, i think it might now be the last one so get on that fast if you want it!

 

this one has gandalfs as well though:

Have you guys ever wondered where are they getting these cards from to sell them off so cheaply? Are they genuine for sure?

The ones I have seem totally legit, if not they are more or less perfect fakes.

If you do a full search you can see that the sellers are getting used core sets, dividing them up into packages, and selling the packages up for profit. I've even seen encounter card sets for sale, but I have no idea who would need those! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
