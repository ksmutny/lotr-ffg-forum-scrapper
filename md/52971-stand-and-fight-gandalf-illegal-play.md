# [Stand and Fight + Gandalf = Illegal play](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52971-stand-and-fight-gandalf-illegal-play/)

## 1 [Ichirou989 on September 11, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52971-stand-and-fight-gandalf-illegal-play/?do=findComment&comment=526614)

I was just reading recently a post over at BoardGameGeek regarding the use of Stand and Fight to bring Gandalf back into play when something rather interesting came up.  Apparently one of the members there asked FFG for clarification regarding the use of the card and in particular the part of the text that's in parenthesis, and received this rather definite response from the designer:

Q: Can "Stand and fight" be used to return a neutral ally to play? the text (the chosen ally can be from any sphere) causes confusion.
A: No, a neutral card does not qualify as belonging to a sphere; therefore Stand and Fight cannot target neutral allies.

I believe this will change both a lot of peoples current use of this card as well as their deckbuilding ideas, and so I thought I would pass this info on over to this site for discussion.

Wow!!!! This will change a lot of things.......... Stand and fight cannot  put back Gandalf.......  Actually i think is better. Sometimes is so much Gandalf around with all this cards like Sneak attack and Stand and fight. This make game more difficult for me is fine.

Wow!  That is a devastating blow.  I have to admit that I missed that interpretation.  Strictly speaking it is correct as Gandalf doesn't belong to any sphere.  However, you could argue that 'neutral' belongs to all spheres.  As this has been cleared up by Nate himself, we must abide by that ruling.  This will mean that there is now one less way of getting repeated Gandalfs.  I wonder if it originally was meant to include neutrals, but they saw a chance to get back at all the people who complained the game was too easy now.  Well spotted anyway.  Cheers!

Awesome. I mean, it sucks, as the best decks out there abuse Gandalf, but as that gets very boring I like this ruling. Makes things more difficult :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

This sounds more like an errata , not a ruling, but I'm fine with that. People will be more open to check new strategies.

I'm not arguing with the ruling, it is what it is. But I don't see anything in the card that strictly forbids the return of a neutral card. The part about an ally belonging to any sphere is only a clarification to show that the card can be used to bring back a tactics ally, for example. The wording is that an ally can be from any sphere, not that is has to be from a sphere. It should not preclude the return of a neutral ally as neutral allies can be played by any sphere. Fortunately, I have not used this card too much to return Gandalf, so it won't be that much of a blow.

The one part that really annoys me is that this is a well known combo that players have been using from the beginning. Yet, FFG has not bothered to put out the clarification to stop this error. In fact, if the person who started this thread would not have been kind enough to share it here, those of us who don't go on that site, would never know. FFG should first and foremost, be a little more proactive and communicate to players when a well known combo is invalid. Second, they should do it here, in the official site, rather than an outside site.

If it were an errata then the text on the card would have changed. This is a clarification in the rules that the keyword "Neutral" doesn't belong to any sphere of influence.

I know this has been brought up before...but it sure would be nice if we had sub forums around here to help keep things like important rulings organizied.

Interesting. I certainly didn't interpret the card that way but I can see it from that angle I guess.

Poor Gandalf. We're like a bunch of young hobbits begging him for fireworks.

Nate reads this forum, I'm sure.  It's just FFG's policy that staff doesn't generally comment on these forums.  Nate's earlier comment was posted on BGG by the person who submitted a rules question.

 

When the next FAQ comes out (expecting this any day now), expect this ruling to be in it.

In the EDGE forums (Spanish distributor of this game) it have two subforums, one for deckbuilding and other for rules questions. I hope FFG do the same.

This makes sense to me and I was always curious as to if that was the case or not, considering Gandalf does not have a sphere symbol on his card. This makes spirit strategy and threat reduction slightly more difficult but it suits the flavor of Gandalf in my opinion, he is rather unpredictable.

This is not the only unclear ruling in my opinion, Some say that Actions can be played between enemy attacks and player attacks however according to the phase chart in the rule book this is not the case. At least not as far as I interpret the phase structure. This makes Aragorn slightly less powerful as he cannot be used in combo with unexpected courage to effectively take part in all the main phases of the game. I thought that this combo really suited him but the phases flow chart expressly states that actions are played after shadow cards are dealt to enemies, then all of combat is resolved, then actions can be played again after combat has fully been resolved.

A bit off topic but I have to say that for this game to find a viable organized play niche FFG and the designers need to clarify alot of glaring rules inconsistencies.

I agree with a lot of your main points.  However, the rulebook explicitly states that actions may be played between combat phases, so by not allowing this you are restricting yourself needlessly.

Actually, this is an errata. No matter what Nate says. The card text reads "Action: Choose an ally with a printed cost of X in any player's discard pile. Put that ally into play under your control. (The chosen ally can belong to any sphere of influence.)" As the text outside of the Brackets does not forbid to use allies of other spheres or neutral allies it has to be text in the brackets that does so. However, the text in the brackets is merely an allowance as the words "can belong to" do not imply "must belong to". It is logically not correct to assume that it does or even to say that I could be read as such.

I just can join the main argumentation here: for me it is an errata

 

The braccets gave an explanation on how to read the main text. But in the end it is good that only sphere characters can be the valid target of the card. I like the change. This will ad more challenge. And please FFG put it in the next clarification/errata release.

Well, at least the ruling is consistent with other LCGs, e.g. how neutral cards are treated in CoC. Still, it wouldn't have occured to me that it had any effect on 'Stand and Fight'. If that's really how the card was supposed to work, it's an extremely poor wording.

## 19 [Dwnhmcntryboy on September 12, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52971-stand-and-fight-gandalf-illegal-play/?do=findComment&comment=527172)

 As there are only 4 spheres of influence in the game and Gandalf does not belong to any sphere Stand and Fight is worded perfectly. It is less an errata and more clearfication. 

## 20 [Titan on September 13, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52971-stand-and-fight-gandalf-illegal-play/?do=findComment&comment=527479)

I would say that, at the moment, it is a clarification, as the text on the card itself has not changed. All we got was the intended interpretation from the Lead Designer. However, it should become an official errata, because the card is indeed poorly worded and it does not readily forbid it's use to return neutral allies. The fact that, for months, the consensus on these forums was that it could, should prove that it is misleading. It simply asks for quite a leap of deduction to figure out that "can belong to any sphere" should also be interpreted as "must belong to a sphere".

In the English language, parentheses are used to add supplementary information. When used correctly, a reader should be able to ignore material enclosed in parentheses without changing the logical meaning of the content. So, if there were somewhere in the rulebook that said you can only target ally cards in the discard pile if they belonged to a sphere of influence, then we would agree with you, but it does not say that.

Further, the word "may" is permissive, not preventative, so even without the parentheses, the language does not match the ruling.

Finally, if the card had been printed with the anti-Gandalf intention in mind, the author would not have even needed to add the last sentence. Instead, it would read:

Action: Choose a non-neutral ally with a printed cost of X in any player's discard pile. Put that ally into play under your control.

So regardless of whether you try to read it through strict interpretation of English or by the writer's intentions, you would reach the conclusion that neutral cards are permitted. Therefore, this ruling is in fact errata, not clarification.

Incidentally, I'm very disappointed Fantasy Flight has not shown any willingness to offer corrections for their errors. This is not a CCG, so I see no excuse not to offer reprints. I have contacted them twice, using two different methods, a month apart, politely inquiring if they would print a correction for the Nazgul of Dol Guldur, and they have not even been polite enough to respond.

To contrast, Czech Games Edition, a much smaller company, mailed me a corrected card, with a less significant error, all the way from the Czech Republic.

So I am now boycotting all Fantasy Flight products, which has at least cost them a few hundred dollars in sales so far.

That's just _one_ use of parentheses. It can (and often is) also used as a stylistic device which can sometimes even (completely) change the meaning of a sentence.

And maybe you think nothing of it, but a smart company will pay attention to their individual customers. My hope is Fantasy Flight is a smart company and they will correct their mistakes, but that's still their choice to make.

Yes, another stupid ruling from a company that struggles with the English language.

How difficult is it to just issue errata for the card that clears up the wording rather than insisting that their non-standard English usage is right? It's not like it's a particularly difficult piece of rewording...

I believe FFG is a smart company, and that they try to correct their mistakes.  However, the way you would correct them may not be the best way for FFG as a company to correct them.  I believe all of FFG products are printed in bulk except for the POD products.  Because of that, it is not just a simple matter to reprint one or two cards that would have text changes.  I would imagine that the text will get added to the Nazgul card when the core set see's a second edition printing.

FFG's method of "fixing" mistakes seems to be to utilize their FAQ until a reprint for a product is done.  I suppose it would be considerate for FFG to respond to you queries about getting a replacement card, but the reply would be something along the lines of a replacement doesn't exist, so you can't be sent one.  Some people get just as peeved, if not more, by a declined request than they do to no response.

Ah, that's useful. I missed that.

 

I started playing Magic back in 1994, and I witnessed Wizards struggle for years with the rules, trying to make things as clear as possible. It's hard to understate how much the rules were cleared up by the global incorporation of the stack - the days before that of duelling interrupts (not instants) were terribly difficult to understand. With FFG's games, though I like a lot about them, the Action/Response structure reminds me very much of the old interrupt days in Magic, where rulings were often arcane.

Thus, I have a lot of trouble with the twin rulings for Thalin and Eleanor, which don't really make much sense when taken together - and go to demonstrate that the underlying rules of the LOTR LCG aren't actually there yet. I find it very, very strange that Thalin can actually cancel a card entirely - despite not having any text to that purpose - whilst Eleanor lets through keyword abilities... 

Stand and Fight, of course, is just sloppy wording. 

What I fear is that LotR will turn into a patchwork of incompatible rulings, because no-one has actually set out how the game works.

I totally agree. What we have here is a situation where two cards (Thalin & Eleanor) do essentially the same thing (In the right circumstances), they both remove a card from play. With Eleanor the keywords are still resolved but with Thalin they are not. I know the mechanics for removing the cards from play are different, but the net result is the same, the card is discarded from play. Yet the keywords are only resolved in one instance?? it seems to me that this is incongruous. There needs to be a ruling about what happens to card effects when the card leaves play.

There are a couple major differences.

1) Eleanor's effect is a "Response" and Thalin's ability is a constant effect.

2) Eleanor's effect says to cancel the When Revealed specifically and then replace the card. Thalin's ability instantly destroys the card as it enters play.

3) Eleanor's effect is on Treachery cards while Thalin's ability is on creatures.

They are definitely similar in that the end result is a card leaving play, but outside of that there are many reasons why these do not function the same. I would say the first point above is probably the most important one in understanding why they do not work quite the same. Maybe if Thalin's ability was "Response: When Thalin is questing and a creature is revealed from the encounter deck, deal 1 damage to that creature." it would be a different case...

 I debate whether Thalin's ability is actually a "constant" effect. It's a very different effect from (say) Armour giving +4 extra health. It's not constantly in effect - it only occurs when you get a particular card draw. That's the problem - the rules don't actually have anything to describe what it actually does. 

## 36 [Svenn on November 2, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52971-stand-and-fight-gandalf-illegal-play/?do=findComment&comment=550972)

Actually, constant effects are defined in the rules...

"Constant effects continually affect the game state as long as the card is in play and any other specified conditions are met. These effects have no bold trigger, as they are always active."

Hey guys in my opinion you give to much credit to to FFG designers. Yes they make a good game but the same time make a lot of mistakes.

From the beginning i was quite sceptic and always give some critic. I sow how they change rules from FAQ to FAQ, play and find  so many holes in the game mechanic (nightmare variant). So with all of those mistakes of them sorry but i cannot say they are brilliant team do they job good.

Now they just try to fix they mistakes nothing more!!! And scoring system seems like really didn work and they cannot change much without affect whole tournament system. Look like big problem for them. So they test job for last 6 months before game was release was  done really bad!!!!

 I sow already many good games and ideas was destroy by bad manage. Lotr tcg by Decipher also have this problem. Secon big set:Two towers  was awful and many players stop to play game cose of this.

I hope they can fix every thing cose i love  the game and enjoy art of the cards.

I am aware of these differences, but I don't see how Thalin's ability being a constant effect changes anything about what happens to the keywords. The effects occur at the same time, because in order for Thalin's ability to happen, a card has to be revealed from the encounter deck. Once the card is revealed, the keyword triggers and Thalin's ability takes effect in the case of the crows, the creature dies and the keyword resolves.

Thalin's ability does not destroy the card, it kills the creature in the case of crows. I still have found any evidence to suggest that a card effect ceases to exist just because the card leaves play.  Eleanor's effect is not restricted just to treachery cards, there are also creatures with when revealed effects on them,

Although it is not clearly stated in the rules. I think it's fairly clear given the new ruling on Eleanor that in LOTR the effect is in fact independant from the source, which would mean that Thalin's ability even if it killed a creature when revealed from the encounter deck, has no bearing on keywords such as doomed and surge. Meaning that they still trigger and resolve.

Against which Eleanor can do absolutely NOTHING about with her ability:

"Exhaust Eleanor to cancel the "when revealed" effects of a treachery card just revealed by the encounter deck." (emphasis added)

Enemies (and Locations) with When Revealed bypass her ability.

As for card effects remaining even if the card is removed, say Witch-King is in the staging area during the quest phase. You Sneak Attack Gandalf and kill him, are you still keeping -1 WP to all characters? I'm guessing not.

Eleanor's effect is not restricted just to treachery cards, there are also creatures with when revealed effects on them,

 

 

Against which Eleanor can do absolutely NOTHING about with her ability:

"Exhaust Eleanor to cancel the "when revealed" effects of a treachery card just revealed by the encounter deck." (emphasis added)

I see what you mean about the treachery cards. touche.

The Witch King's ability is a constant effect which requires the Witch King to be in the staging area to activate. Once you kill the Witch King it is removed from the staging area thus, its ability ceases to be in effect. However a triggered ability such as a keyword only requires the card to be revealed to trigger and resolve. All I'm saying is that I can't find a ruling that says it is cancelled if the card bearing it  is discarded, and if the ruling on Eleanor is anything to go off, it would seem that keyword effects once triggered are independant of their source. My apologies I should have worded my last post better. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

What I see is that veteran Magic players here assume that it should work like a stack. Fair enough, it seems to have worked well for Magic. But there it does not seem to be a stack. As far as I understand, it looks it works more like a queue of events and keywords (if we can make another computing analogy), which can then be interrupted by the resolution of various effects. According to the rules, we resolve "When revealed" first, then Doomed and Surge.

Thus, Thalin constant effect applies immediately after the card is revealed, thus may interrupt an enemy with only 1HP.

Eleanor does not, because she only cancels the "When revealed" part. So the card is revealed -> skip When revealed -> Doomed and Surge.

I agree we could benefit greatly from a very precise, rigorous, definition of the sequence of events, especially where each effect/keyword takes place (e.g. if in sequence). But even so, they do not need to be a stack.

Nate did so in the latest CoC FAQ, but I guess that with LotR it might take more time because they need to test it?

I'll eat my cards if LotR is supposed to have a stack.

The most recent FAQ for CoC included a detailed sequence of events. I wouldn't be surprised if something similar wouls be in the works for LotR.

People who used stack before can't stop thinking about it and tend to see stack in every game, this is a known condition (which I also suffer sometimes)

I'm not saying there should be a stack. I'm just saying there should be some sort of detailed sequence to how events trigger and resolve. I do play magic, but I only started playing this year so I'm definitely not a veteran, actually I'm not even very good at it :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] I'm just a casual player and I tend to prefer the multiplayer formats of it.

I dont know guys. I dont have any problem with a rule since the explain how forced response and action work. for me is everything clear.

I never have a doubt about Eleanor and other cases which discuss here on the forum. Sometimes some people just think to much maybe???

Anyway cheers

I have reveived a reply from Nate French regarding Thalin and whether surge resolves when Eastern Crows is revealed. I know that not everyone puts much stock in these but I thought I'd share the reply with all of you nonetheless, by the way , I was wrong :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

"The surge will not resolve if the card is killed by Thalin's ability. Key word in Thalin is "as it is revealed,: which specifies that his effect resolves during the process of revealing the cards, vs When Revealed and Surge effects which resolve when the card is fully revealed.

Thanks.

Still, I could understand one may dislike the "as it is revealed" vs "fully" revealed, where "fully" is never clearly defined by the rules. It seems strange because - a priori - a card is either revealed or not. What would be a real clarification would be to give a precise sequence of event resolution. It seems clear that they are resolved as a queue, which can be interrupted if a card is killed (Thalin and 1HP cards), or where some steps are simply skipped (Eleanor's ability). For instance, we could have: constant effects (when conditions are met)->actions->responses->forced effects (when conditions are met)->when revealed->doomed->guarded->surge. Now the authors would need to check that such a sequence is compatible with all the cards (at this stage, there are not that many, so it is feasible), but that would make everyone happy. But maybe I am too anal there? Because honestly, I have not encountered any problem so far, once Thalin and Eleanor's abilities have been clarified.
