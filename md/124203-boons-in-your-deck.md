We now have Boons that you can add to your deck: Sting, Glamdring, Mithril Shirt, and Anduril.

 

In the Hobbit saga expansions, Treasure cards added to your deck did not contribute to the 50 card minimum.  I don't see any rules like that about Boon cards in the Road Darkens rule sheet, but maybe I am missing it somewhere? Can Boons be part of the 50 cards you use to get to the 50 card minimum for a deck?

Ah, there it is.  Thanks for that.  I can't find anything like that in the Road Darkens rule booklet, but I guess that is just an oversight.

Hi there,

Can we Have Boon cards in our decks when playing other completely irrelevant scenarios of other cycles?

I suppose it is a silly question. Of course we can.

Or not?

Let me look...ah yes here it is...using boon cards in irrelevant scenarios can get you 20 years in prison.

The boons are not made for using in other quests, but you can do it if you want.  .It could be rather fun in certain circumstances I suppose.  If you want to, go for it!

Are you kidding? Of course it is fun to have Glamdring and Anduril!

And rather thematic also!

2 in 1! I suggest it! But keep away from the police! 20 years is a long way!
