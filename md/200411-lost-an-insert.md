Hey everyone! I seem to have misplaced the insert for the long dark. Either that or it put on the one ring just to mess with me. Is there a solution for this or am I just out of luck?

If you want a hard copy, you could try contacting FFG's customer support. I've worked with them before and in my experience they have been quite helpful.
