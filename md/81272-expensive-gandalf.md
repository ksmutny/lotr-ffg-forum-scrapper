Hey guys… anyone else noticed that Gandalf has a resource cost of 6 on the core-set box and the lotr home page on the website?  Must have been something that got changed last minute.  Apologies if this has already been discussed

if you search in lotr lcg ffg and look at pictures you will find several examples of these changes…some look quite cool actually

Another difference is that the response (threat readuction, damage or draw) could only be trigerred when played from hand - a big shaft compared to the final version; however, the initial would discard an enemy instead of dealing four damage. The version we got seems better balanced.

I agree, the same can be said of Thorin too.  Intially his effect was something like 'Wounds on Thorin can be spent as resources'.  Way over-powered IMO… also makes Gloin (Hero) less of an attractive proposition.

I presumed that proto-version of Thorin was what eventually morphed into the (core set) Gloin.

Yes, though they still kept Thorin a reource-accelerator. I wish Thorin was the one giving bonus to Dwarves, rather than Dain. I believe his character's overall appeal was stronger, and Dain's more centered around the Dwarves of the Iron Hills. The fact Dain's boosting ability is way too strong is another matter.
