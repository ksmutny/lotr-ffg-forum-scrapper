hi! I'm sorry I'm sure this question had been asked but, I'm just a dummy and can't seem to find the answer…

I want to know how to play with more than 2 people…. what rules change, what mechanics change, what I need to do differently or if everything plays exactly the same?

thank you so much for your help!

hi

there is nothing really different- 1st player token passes clockwise to the left (im pretty sure that right). you just need to draw 3 encounter cards as there are 3 players

you will also need an extra threat tracker or just use pen and paper

ic… so only difference it's to draw an extra card from encounter deck… so 3 for 3 player 4 for 4 players I'm guessing….. awesome! thank you so much for the quick response!!!!
