Hey guys,

When you attack an enemy as a result of defending with Anduril, is there any chance of anyone else joining the attack. For example someone with ranged?

Many thanks,

No.
That hero attacks alone. But there are many ways to boost that hero´s attack, so he/she can actually make a kill. See for example combo Eomer-Anduril-Firefoot here on this forum I posted earlier. 

(Btw I am sorry but I have say it: I like you avatar for this question. Aragorn asking how his weapon works? :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] )

I've been carrying the broken pieces of it around for so long I've forgotten how the **** thing works.

Good answers.  Thank you both for posting.  A follow-up question is "does the attached hero exhaust when attacking using Anduril's response ability"?  If he does, why exhaust anduril?  Thanks.

If I'm not mistaken, Anduril's ability triggers after defending an attack so the attached character is already exhausted.

 

You exhaust Anduril because the designers didn't want an inexhaustible defender (such as Beregond + Hour of Wrath) to counterattack each enemy.

there are many ways to ready characters but currently no ways to ready attachments, so by exhausting the attachment, they've put a hard limit on using its ability once per turn and still allow the character to ready and be used in other ways
