 If Aragorn (Leadership Hero) has Song of Wisdom attached, can he attach A Burning Brand too?

Don't attack Brand.  He's on our side.

He may not. Song of Wisdom just gives a character a Lore resource icon. It does not make Aragorn a Lore character.

Here are the three relevant pieces of card text.


"Song of Wisdom
Attached hero gains a [Lore] resource icon."

"Resource Icons: Found only on hero cards, these icons indicate the sphere(s) of influence to which resource tokens in this hero’s resource pool belong.
They also indicate to which sphere(s) the hero card itself belongs."

"A Burning Brand
Text: Attack to a [lore] character.
While attached character is defending, cancel any shadow effects on cards dealt to the attacking enemy. "

 

So, yes, this combination works.  Song of wisdom grants the lore resource icon, and the resource icon makes the hero belong to the relevant sphere.

To echo Bohemond, this is a legitimate play because characters only belong to a certain sphere by virtue of the resource icon(s) they possess. Aragorn is a Leadership hero only because he possesses a Leadership resource icon. Logically, then, having a Lore resource icon--whether it is printed on the card or acquired through a Song--makes the hero a Lore hero (and able to wield A Burning Brand).

Yes sure. And according to Nate France   answer even if Aragorn lose somehow the Song and lose the Lore icon with that, the brand will stay on him cose Lore icon is only required when you play the attachments.

Good point. Attachments in this game only check for requirements when they come into play; should a character lose the relevant traits/resource icons later in the scenario, the attachments will not be discarded.
