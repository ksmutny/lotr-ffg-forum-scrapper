 hello everyone,i'm new here.I have a question about  Boromir and Landroval.May i use Boromir‘s ability to discard him then trigger Landroval's ability to put Boromir back into play? I notice the text of Landroval using the word "destroy",on the other hand,the text of Boromir using the word "discard",so i'm not sure whether the eagle's ability can trigger legally.

this has been asked alot in the past and im not sure if it was ever clarified….but the general opinion back then was that he cannot be as destroyed does not equal discarded

 There is an official answer here [http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/7589517] from Nate French that isn't completely clear, but I take to mean that "destroyed" and "discarded" are indeed different things.

 another question:Landroval's ability can be used once,this "once" means the whole game once or a copy of the card once which means i can play another copy of Landroval to trigger its ability again?

 This one has also been officially answered, here: http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/index.php?/topic/1702-official-nate-rule-clarifications-updated-27012012/page__p__4141#entry4141 [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/index.php?/topic/1702-official-nate-rule-clarifications-updated-27012012/page__p__4141#entry4141] 

I must say, I think it is silly that the designers answer rules questions via private email, but rely on the community to publicise them via various forums, rather than just putting all such answers into the official FAQ (not to mention, updating it more often).
