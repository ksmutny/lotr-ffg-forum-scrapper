I've only just got a hold of the core set of this and was running the basic Passage Through Mirkwood scenario when the following rule questions arose, largely surrounding at what point I had actually won the scenario. I had drawn the victory card that asks you to defeat Ungoliant's Spawn in order to win, I assumed that as soon as this was done then I'd won, no more questing was required as there was a 0 on the card's progress requirement section.

 

1a) Upon drawing the last quest card it asks each player to find one Spider card of their choice from the Encounter Deck AND Encounter Discard Pile. Does this mean draw one spider from each, (resulting in there being two drawn in a solo game)? Or just find one spider from either (leaving only one drawn in a solo game)?

 

1b) Seeing as the requirement to complete the scenario is to defeat Ungoliant's Spawn, is there any real reason why you would NOT choose to draw Ungoliant's Spawn at this point?

 

2) In the Refresh phase I thought I'd be cunning and play Quick Strike on Gimli to deal 8 damage to Ungoliant's Spawn and THEN have him refresh ready for the next round. After making the move I checked the round sequence overview and actions could only be played after the refresh mandatory actions had occurred and not during or within so I could not refresh him. Did I play this correctly in leaving him exhausted?

 

3) Slightly peeved by my loss of Gimli I drew my next card which was a Gondorian Spearman, which I played, then optionally took the threat damage from the quest phase and had the Spawn and the other Spider engage me. I dealt two shadow cards face down to each monster then opted to have Gondorian Spearman defend against the Spawn and left the other Spider undefended. The Spearman's response on declaration as a defender has him immediately deal one damage to his attacker, killing Ungoliant's Spawn - did I win the game at this point? I had not yet turned over Ungoliant Spawn's shadow card (it was something harmless but what if it had been "remove the current defender" or something similar?)

 

4) Unrelated to the above: One encounter card, I forget which, has "Victory 5" written at the end of it. This card entered play as a shadow card for the combat phase, when that combat phase finished and the shadow card was discarded, should I have set it aside to count for victory points later or would it only have counted for victory points if I had actually encountered and defeated the card properly? Conversely if I had encountered the card normally would I receive the victory point bonus for defeating it normally or do I only get the bonus where it is used in it's shadow card capacity?

 

Ok that's all I can think of for now, thanks in advance for any help! happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]

Just realised that I shouldn't have been able to play Quick Strike on Gimli as it requires an eligible monster to attack yet the monsters drawn from the quest card hadn't engaged me yet. Regardless, let's assume I had found some way to exhaust a character through an action during the refresh phase. Could I make the action, exhaust the character, then refresh them? (I currently believe you can't refresh them if you exhaust them like this).

1a) Just one spider is drawn. It does not say to draw a spider from each. The inclusion of the discard pile is to insure you can get the Spawn in case it was sent there during the game.

1b) If the Spawn was currently in play when the card was drawn, you would have to choose another spider. Of course, that wouldn't be a choice, you would be forced to do this.

2) Yes

3) The victory condition is that you must defeat the Spawn. The moment you accomplish this, the game is over. All else is irrelevant.

4)Victory points do not count if a card is used as a shadow card. It must defeated or explored.

Hi Sacred Voice,

1a) Each player only chooses 1 spider to add to the staging area, and they can choose that spider from either the encounter deck or discard pile.  They don't take one from each.

1b) There is no good reason to not choose Ungoliant's Spawn at that point in the game.

2) You did play it correctly by leaving Gimli exhausted.  I am curious to know why you didn't just have him attack during the combat phase though.

3) The game would end as soon as you kill Ungoliant's Spawn.  The damage dealt by your Gondorian Spearman happens before the step that resolves shadow effects, so even if the shadow card removed your defender the shadow card wouldn't have a chance to resolve before the game ended.

4) While the victory points are below the Shadow bar (whatever it's called) I believe the intention was to gain the victory points only after the card is revealed normally and then defeated.

I hope you continue to enjoy the game.

Only if you have a way to refresh the character through an action. Something like Ever Vigilant or Grim Resolve. Otherwise, the timing is just not there. The cards refresh and no actions are possible until after that. If you exhaust a character here, it would stay exhausted.

If you had already killed the Ungoliant's Spawn till the point you reached the last card of the quest..do you have to draw it back? and also if there more enemies or locations in the staging area do i have to "resolve" them before i yell my victory scream? thanks

My bet is that he finished stage 2B using Legolas's ability.
