The news are just up, and finally we have the last hero of Dwarrowdelf. As much have said, it is no other than Elrond himself, and his ring of power: Vilya.

I wonder why we always get shown lore and spirit cards that are way too cool. Okay, I just realized that Vilya is a neutral card, but still: the last tactis card that thrilled me was the Erebor Battle Master.

Maybe the tactic cards in the last pack are too powerful to show yet.

Oh and R.I.P. Daughter of the Nimrodel

That's interesting. It means playing him in a multi-sphere deck will be even easier - he doesn't even have to pay for his attachment all on his own.

 Hm, what's the point of Vilya giving Elrond SPIRIT sphere when you can already use his resources as SPIRIT and it can't be played on anyone else? I can't remember but is there a card/cards that benefits only SPIRIT sphere?

Elrond's only allows you to pay for for spirit allies.  Their are a ton of good spirit cards (Unexpected Courage, Test of will, and even, surprisingly, Elrond's Counsel, etc) that you can't play unless you have Vilya.

Hmmh, as my decks are mostly ally-centred, I might not need Vilya. After all, spirit events and attachments are not that expensive and can be paid by another spirit hero.

 

Btw, "Peace, and Thoughtful" is probably not only the most beautiful, but also the most powerful of the three revealed cards. At least for Noldor (Twins!) and Dwarf decks, and also for a Boromir/Coragorn deck. Combined with Protector of Lórien this card can speed up progress - and it is surprisingly cheap. Why not giving it the secrecy key word?

I also liked this card a lot. It his indeed cheap (1 lore cost) for a card that allows to draw 5 cards, despite the fact that it is used in refresh phase and needs 2 ready heroes.

But what is that when you can have a deck with so many allies, that you do not need your heroes to do anything…

 

Regarding to Elrond and Vilya: It is a great combo, once more (Glorfindel, LoV and Asfaloth).

 

Elrond is a great hero, despite his high threat and opens a great new possibilities in deck building…

I think people may need to reassess Peace and Thought (unless I have the rules wrong, in which I need to reassess it).  Phase 7, the refresh phase, starts with several red sub-phases, which include untapping all of your characters.  You only get the option to play cards in phase seven after you do your untaqs.  So, you play this card after you untap.  In other words, you can't play it on characters you didn't use last turn, but have to play it on characters you won't use next turn. So, it's an awful card for Dain, the Twins or Coragorn (boromir, as always, still rocks it). 

It's a solid card, but it comes at a huge cost; especially early in the game.

There are ways to get around it. Using Erebor Record Keeper to ready your heroes before questing, or Lure of Moria in a Dwarf deck (although 4 resources for 5 cards is a bit costly, in my opnion). It is definitely a risk and reward card. I am really excited to see the rest of the player cards. From the cards we have seen, this might be the best AP in regards to player cards yet.

With POL this card can be vary powerful. This card is not for the early stage of the game in solo session. But later when you have a lot of allies, you can draw lot of cards to finish quest in 1go with POL.But still think this card will shine in coop games.

What is more interesting: all this new quite powerful cards(from FOS and SAF) have really low cost. And they are not consider to be secrecy anymore.

Maybe FFG abandon this idea? Cose in my opinion secrecy didn work properly anyway.

 This is going to be a fantastic card for solo play!  I can imagine the possibilities of Elrond, Spirfindel, and Legolas in an elf deck.

Looks like all this new player cards perfecty fit solo decks. Make them much more stronger then before.

With new Glorifindel my new solo deck now can win every quest even Dol-Guldor. Still very hard to win Against Dol-Guldor but possible. I do it twice already.

So for now solo decks can be completely playable and have same power as a coop decks. Hmmm…. but then if solo decks is going to be so powerful when you combo together 2 powerful solo deck in coop game they will overwhelm any quest!? Maybe my MTG and other card game experience (balance between the cards) play bad joke with me?

But what i see now is more and more unbalanced way: new players cards now is much more powerful then any new encounter cards.

With all this new heroes and attachments you can build up now really strong fellowships, reduce your threat quite low and dont really need to face all those strong enemies. But then when i look on the Balrog card  i scary. Will be really difficult to deal with him even with new Glorifindel and Elrond.Sound like we will have a really brutal fight there. And this how is should be in my opinion!

I don't want to wait until August!   I may have to go into photoshop and pull out the image of Elrond and Vilya and dupe them until the box comes out!
