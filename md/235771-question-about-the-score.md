Probably not many people care about score, but for those who care, I have a question: when playing 2-handed, what happens when one deck dies by threat? what's the score penalty? only +50, or also the +8 for each dead hero?

As I interpret it, it's 50+ the threat value of the eliminated heroes. 

 

 

EDIT:

 

Page 22 of the Core rulebook:

 

"A group's score is determined by adding together four undesirable elements (the final threat level of each player, the threat penalty on all dead heroes, the number of damage tokens on all surviving heroes, and the number of rounds taken to defeat the scenario multiplied by ten)..."

 

and

 

"When a player is eliminated, his threat is considered 50, and all of his heroes are considered dead. Note that an eliminated player's threat does not, however, increase beyond his threat elimination level (50, unless otherwise specified by the quest rules or by a card effect)."

 

Note that threat elimination in the above quote is not the same thing as score. For the eliminated player, score is threat elimination level (which they clarify cannot be higher than 50, even if your threat gain might have exceeded 50) + threat penalty of each dead hero.

Huh, so that makes the self-sacrificing deck archetype way less appealing if you care about score. I never noticed that their threat was set to 50 upon elimination.

i actually like this a lot, even though i pretty much haven't calculated my score since after my first few games of playing.
