 I was wondering if anyone had created a site with the complete card data base. I like a fool, bought the starter kit, and then a bunch of chapter packs, however I threw away the actual packaging and cant remember all of which ones I've bought to date. Yeah, dumb I know.

lotrlcg.com/ [http://lotrlcg.com/]

Then there is the very nice "LOTR LCG Deck Builder" program for Windows which also contains a comprehensize card database:

Hope this helps.
