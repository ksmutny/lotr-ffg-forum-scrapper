 I feel really bone-headed for not noticing this before. I was looking through my Tactics cards last night and came to Dwarven Axe. It always bothered me that it had a rusty blood stain on the edge of the axe. I don't know, I'm just not into gore all that much. But something looked different this time, so I looked harder at the "rusty blood stain." Suddenly I saw it! It was the reflection of a dwarf looking at the axe blade. It wasn't a rusty blood stain after all! I gained new appreciation for that artwork last night as I studied the dwarf's reflection. What a neat idea for card art! I don't know why I didn't see it before!

Haha, it took me about a month or two into the existence of the game to come to a similar discovery (and subsequent feelings upon it). Not my favourite art but certainly an interesting one.

Oh cool man! I have never noticed that before either; always thought it was blood stains as well! Thanks for sharing. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]  I like the Dwarf face much better.

You just blew my mind.
