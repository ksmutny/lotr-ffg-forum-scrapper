Here is what I have,

 

Current party is engaged by a King Spider and a Forest Spider. 

 

Beginning of combat phase I deal one shadow card to each enemy. 

 

With one resource token I play the card Feint - A Combat action card that chooses an engaged enemy (King Spider). That enemy cannot attack that player this turn.

 

easy enough - 

 

Question - does the unrevealed shadow card still flip and resolve even though the King spider cannot attack me this turn? or does it get discarded?

 

Thanks, 

 

Mike

Q: If an enemy does not attack or its attack is canceled, what happens to its shadow card(s)? 

A: At the end of the combat phase, discard each unresolved shadow card in play. (Do not resolve the effects on these shadow cards)
