This game was so sad!!! I lost Gollem in the fourth turn or so and re-shuffled him back into the deck. 

I was playing a solo game with my my Rohan based mono-spirit deck, so I managed to keep my threat down while trying to whittle away the deck to find him again. By the end I had about my entire deck of allies in play, had used all my Gandalfs just to lower my threat, and was waiting for a Dwarven tomb to get a Greeting card back.

I hit 50 threat with 5 cards left in the encounter deck. Gollem was on the very bottom… Dwarven tomb was the next card in my deck….

To avoid this kind of problem play with house rule: when Gollum get 8 tokens he escape and you lose a game.

Haha, Glaurung! That is exactly how I play when 8 tokens get on him!

I thought you're supposed to knock back a drink for every progress token on Gollum. That properly scales the difficulty!

However, that's more a multi-player tradition and rarely used in solo mode.

 It was actually pretty fun when it got down to the wire. Seeing 10 cards left in the encounter deck and knowing that the Gollum card had to be next. I am glad I kept playing!

One drink per token huh? My wife might be pretty curious about why I was passed out on the floor in the morning!
