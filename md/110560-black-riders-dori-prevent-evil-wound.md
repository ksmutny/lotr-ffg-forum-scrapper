Quick question - in "Flight to the Ford" could I exhaust Dori to take the damage from Frodo's "Evil Wound"?

Reading "Evil Wound" only, I don't see something to prevent this.

the wording seems funny on evil wound, it doesnt say 'place equal amount of damage' ... but 'reduce the ring bearer's life' ....strange really

True. Sounds intentional to me. Hmmm...
