Hey all. Very simply, I'm looking to buy a copy of Hunt for Gollum. I know it's hard to find and I'm willing to pay, let me know if you've got a spare or if a game shop around you had a copy for $15 and maybe we can make a deal!

Don't have none, but can say that the Hunt for Gollum adventure pack is on reprint.

 

As of 11th of April, it is on the boat, so it could be in the shops in mid May...
