Is there an iOS deckbuilder available for LOTR LCG?  I'm aware of the various sites so just curious if one exists...

Your best bet is still ringsdb.com. If you need it offline, you can always open up a tab with the deckbuilder while you have internet connection - you'll still be able to build once you go offline. Just make sure you connect back to the internet before you try saving it.
