I'm glad to finally see another Istari hero, albeit a bit salty it's no Saruman.

Excellent.  Excited to see these cards.  I've been skeptical of a hero Radagast, but looking at him, I'm ok with him atm.

I'm very grateful that the creatures they've added to the game so far make thematic sense for decks outside of just a Radagast deck. The hound and the raven make thematic sense in a wide number of decks - hobbits, anyone? Tom cotton plus farmer maggot plus his dogs?

Radagast's staff works extremely well on ally Radagast in mono-tactics Eagles decks.

Raven Messenger works with Wizard Pipe.  I fear the Hound means we won't get Cotton's specific dogs, but can't complain about 2 attack for 2 lore resources with a useful ability.

In an Eagles/Radagast deck, Gwaihir's Debt gets you a full round of core Gandalf for 1 tactics resource if he's in your hand -- after which he returns to your hand!  And if Radagast has a Wizard's Pipe, you can put Gandalf back and do it again.

At last we've found a cheap tactics event where original Hama really could break the game...

Speculation on the missing text of Mithril Shirt?

I wrote this morning at BGG in a thread on "Why is there not an Eagles hero":

"With the last unrevealed hero probably Lore, it's not likely that we'll get an Eagle since they're exclusively tactics. I wouldn't mind a Lore Radagast that has some power that synergizes with eagles somehow; even though it's the wrong sphere, Eagles are found outside mono-tactics deck, and a synergistic high-willpower lore hero would make a lovely splash for a double tactics Eagles deck.

Not that I'm expecting a Lore Radagast, either."

I wasn't expecting it, but I got it!  Since my psychic powers were working well for Bilbo and Radagast, maybe my dream about seeing the Blue Wizards in a Rhun cycle will come true also...

My guess is you'd be able to reduce that damage by 1. Maybe 2.

1 sounds too weak for a Guarded item. Like, why even bother. 2 sounds too little to bother for me as well, but that's me.

I thought that too at first but it seems too powerful. Maybe if you had to exhaust it first...

Well, Radagast was expected (at least from me) and while I am dissappointed to not see the Elendilmir, the Mithril Shirt seems rather strong. I do not see any limitations: It is not restricted and has no limit per round or exhaustion requirement, resulting in +1 Defense effectively and protection from direct damage.

## 12 [Halberto on February 8, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/290618-the-fate-of-wilderland/?do=findComment&comment=3618091)

Radegast is going to be a great defensive choice in lore. Quest for 2 free and then defend for 3 with burning brand. Add in discounted eagles allies and you have the base for a decent combat deck

The going rate for repeatable damage cancellation is 2 cost for one damage cancelled per round. 1 cost for one damage per instance of damage is excellent value, especially in spirit.

Still, at 1 damage reduction, it does become probably the weakest of the guarded attachments. If it's reducing 2 damage, then suddenly it's probably the strongest.

## 14 [dalestephenson on February 8, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/290618-the-fate-of-wilderland/?do=findComment&comment=3618094)

It does protect from direct damage, archery, etcetera -- but the most common use of damage prevention is defense, and getting a *Guarded* attachment for effective +1 defense would be massively underwhelming.  (Though I also found the +1 defense +1 hp Mithril Shirt in Road Darkens underwhelming. Cheaper than Ring Mail and lighter, but not any better?  This is *mithril*)

Being able to reduce *anyone's* damage once per round as Honour Guard does is often more useful than reducing one hero's damage any number of times per round.  At 1 damage reduction I'd say it's easily the weakest, though since it's guarded only by locations that may be expected (though it also makes Tactics Bilbo less useful at getting it...)

I was actually thinking raven - winged helm, although your comment generally gets at why the helm is generally passed over in favor of honour guard

I hope this is more a case of starting to develop the Istari trait. Not only for this pack, but for future ones.

 

Love the hero art and the mechanics. It suits perfect with Eagles, too.

I don't know that any of them are future staples, but the spoiled cards and hero just took Eagles deck a *huge* step forward IMO.

Absolutely love this. What can I even say, this is my favorite cycle ever. Radagast looks amazing, as do all these cards.

I can see some nice combos: Gwaihir's Debt can be used as a more powerful version of Sneak Attack Gandalf in Tactics, as long as you have Radagast with a Wizard Pipe and Gwaihir or one of his brethren out. Radagast can also use the Messenger Raven for action advantage and potential card draw. With his Staff it is for free and with the Wizard Pipe the draw is guaranteed. He is also a decent target for Burning Brand.

Well theres still a couple of nice things to keep in mind:

--location guard. That means you could potentially discard and clear out a whole host of enemies in an encounter deck filled with nasty enemies.

-- any hero. No restriction on type. The worry was that Mithril Shirt would be limited to hobbits or dwarves. No worries now.

--as others have mentioned, it doesnt appear to have an exhaust mechanism. Meaning any treachery dealing damage should be essentially canceled or at least significantly mitigated. Same archery. It basically gives the hero "toughness" for those familiar with the saga term. Even toughness 1 would be solid on the right hero.

-- on the same vein, shadow damage or card effects such as snow warg fizzle.

Personally love it. Seems to be one of the only guarded cards I would always feel comfortable playing (unless I was already location locked).

GREAT call. I am very meh about the hero version now (even though I am proud to have called it), but that staff on the ally is great. Especially since you can send enemies back when needed, not during a specific phase. Technically after the encounter portion but before the combat phase. I imagine you could do well with hero sam or even bilbo, if needed.

I’ll wait to see the decks to be proven wrong.  Mono red eagles (Teowyn/Hirgon/??) is already a reasonable deck.  I’m not sure adding Radagast will make it better.  Especially on the first few turns.

Oh i wish Radagast where 3/1/3/4 and had the healer trait, but oh well. Anyhow i feel the staff would be god on the ally.... Gandalf hero word of command and elfstone and Radagast ally and eagels...hummm have to think so many possibities.

The other tactics card will probably be a unique eagle ally to enable Gwaihir's debt, maybe Gwaihir himself. But then he would be the first ally with two different versions in the same sphere.

I am also of this persuasion. Very powerful against huge single attacks, but not so useful againts repeated small damage.

Reducing damage to 1 was my first thought, but then I thought it would be too powerful because it would make defending trivial with just a little bit of healing.

Maybe, but wouldn't reducing damage by 1 completely negate archery damage, which is assigned point by point? I think it has to be reduced to 1 to avoid breaking archery (unless, and this is likely, I'm misremembering how archery works).

Archery is assigned simultaneously, which means you would not go, "Assign 1 point here; cancel with Mithril Shirt. Assign 1 point here; cancel with Mithril Shirt…" ad nauseum. Instead, you assign it all at once (up to the HP of the character, which is one of the more frequently asked questions that is curiously omitted from the current FAQ), at which point you could then use the Shirt to do whatever it is it's going to do.

I agree that reducing "to 1" would be OP. Even outside of the huge effect on boss fights, you could just throw the shirt on Gloin (or if you don't want to be so greedy, even, say, Galadriel), take 3 undefended attacks of arbitrary strength, then heal the damage with one trigger of Ioreth…? Seems silly.

Excited about Radagast in this pack. Good to have a reason to revisit eagles and also to try a Radagast and his beasts deck with only him as a hero and many creatures. It may not be good, but it would be fun to have a pack of animals to run around with.

I'm excited for him as well but he seems pretty niche. I'm afraid I might get bored of playing him with his Creatures. But I guess he could act as another defender if someone else is using Beregond. The threat cost of 11 seems kind of high for using him only as a defender though, idk.

Excited about Radagast, he brings Lore access to an Eagle deck, which buys you card draw and healing. A mono-tactics Eagles deck can stall out if you don't draw your The Eagles Are Coming or if they whiff.  And his staff can ready your stacked-up Eagles of the Misty Mountains or make them easier to play.  Also, returning a creature to the staging area unlocks shenaniganry for Descendant of Thorondor. 

Currently it's hard to imagine him being used much outside of an Eagles deck; the creatures that exist otherwise don't particularly inspire deckbuilding, and the ones included in the pack with him aren't auto-includes in a Radagast deck.  If anything, this is more evidence that there will be another cycle. We seem to get teases of "what's to come" with the final heroes in some cycles, like Dain before the dwarf trait was really developed, or Arwen before Noldor.  New Creature trait incoming?

Also interestingly, Radagast could fit into an Eagles Hirgon deck by allowing you to play two allies per round (with his staff's cost reduction and Hirgon's ability).  However, another way of looking at it is that they clash with each other. If you are not able to play 2 allies every round, your deck will not be running at full efficiency.  Hirgon's timing means that you'll play your ally after Radagast will have quested or not quested.

I think Radagast has potential outside an Eagles deck.  He has several things going for him:

First, he's got first class defensive potential.  In Lore, home of Burning Brand, only Treebeard is better, and Treebeard can't take restricted attachments.

Second, he doesn't exhaust to quest when a creature is played *and* he's coming in a pack with a 1-cost creature that can freely be returned to your hand.  That creature can't attack or defend, which means it *can* quest and likely has 1 wp.  So once he gets a Raven (and they're not unique) for 1 leadership resource per turn he + Raven can produce 3 willpower for questing and still provide hero defense.  That's on par with Leadership Aragorn.  Oh, and when returning to hand the Raven gives you the same chance as Expert Treasure Hunter for card draw off the top of your deck.

Third, when you get a Wizard Pipe, the Raven gives you *guaranteed* card draw.

Fourth, if you include the staff the Raven is free.  (Though you could use it instead to play the Hound for free, which is a pretty efficient ally at full cost with a useful ability -- you could also use it to ready the hound, or to good effect on enemy in certain quests -- being able to prevent Attercop from ever attacking you in Return to Mirkwood, for instance.)

To get to #4 is a three card combo, but just the Raven/Pipe combo is well worth the one resource per turn, especially since the resource can come from either leadership or Radagast.

Stereotypical Eagles Deck (Gwaihir edition) uses Mablung -- and doesn't use ally Radagast.  Mablung generates resources for those hungry Eagles, but I'd prefer a 2-cost attachment that decreases cost by *2*, paying for itself on the first turn with anything besides a Vassal.  Plus when not being used it can ready an Eagle, like a stacked-up Eagles of the Misty Mountains.  Then Radagast can quest without exhausting frequently, which Mablung can't do, while being quite as useful as Mablung in the combat phase (since I love hero defense, I quite prefer a 3-def lore defender to Mablung as a Support of the Eagles target).  You have less tactics resource, but you have access to lore -- I think this is a reasonable trade, and the only Eagle-related thing that becomes more expensive is Support, since Radagast can pay for Eagles.  You have access to the Raven/Wizard Pipe combo.  And you have access to Gwaihir's Debt for a full-round Sneak Attack of Gandalf *or* Eagles -- without chance of whiffing, if you have a pipe.

I think that's going to be a step up from mono red eagles, including on the first few turns -- built-in action advantage for Radagast in the first few turns, even if his staff hasn't shown up yet, is going to be most helpful then.

That's where the Raven comes in -- by the time you can't put two Eagles in play, you can replay the Raven each turn and possibly get card draw as well.

Oh, I really like hero Radagast. I mostly play saga, and there with four resources and just one Tactics hero, you now only need his Staff to be able to play Eagles of the Mistly Mountains round 1: to have Radast questing and ready. I think that is great, and just one of many scenarios.

I am thinking of putting him together with Theodred and Beorn. 31 is not low but managable and you can pile Lore resources from the start. The new Raven and Hound will help in the deck I feel as well and I am excited if we also get another eagle to go with the great Tactics event.

I am basically with this. I see little reason for not going with Radagast. The Staff is just amazing, and I think people, for some reason, underestimate the value of ‘free’ questing, especially if the combat stats are not bad. Yes, 2 attack is not amazing these days but usable in the beginning and 3 defense (especially in Lore) quite rare. Also, the Staff can do the other two tricks when needed, though the cost reduction seems by far the most valuable.

I have always found Leadership to go great with the Eagles, because of Sneak Attack and A Very Good Tale, but then often were forced to go with two Tactics heroes because of the costs. Radagast feels like solving all these puzzles, he acts like a Tactics hero in terms of resources but a Lore hero in terms of a potential card draw or healing (though the latter might be redundant, or not have enough room for in the deck).

Song of Battle fixes that. And while two attack might not seem much, it can be the difference between killing an enemy or not.

Of course it is a fix, it is just a clear disadvantage compared to a Tactics hero. But I personally do not find a space for Support in my Eagles decks. And yes, exacly, the 2 willpower and 2 attack round 1 is very nice for many a quest.

Yeah, looks great, and I just dig the damage cancelation, as I dig hero Beorn. But the hound is quite good just for the stats, more so considering Radagast, even more so considering the Staff.

Yes, I forget Support of the Eagles needs a tactics hero.  I love Support of Eagles on a defender, +4 defense with a Winged Guardian out makes it far and away the best attachment -- especially since it's non-unique, non-restricted, and counts for the whole phase.  And it only takes two attachments for Misty to reach +4.  It can get insane.

But as cool as Support would be on Radagast, the Song of Battle requirement hits hard -- he doesn't need tactics for anything besides it, so it's rather like packing Song of Wisdom just so A Burning Brand can be attached.

Though putting together combos is pretty easy with Radagast, since he can both quest and use Word of Command.

I also find it so. I usually like to go for songs when I can pack a few advantages together.

By the way, the more I think about the Raven, the more I like it. Beorn, are you sure, it has 1 willpower? I know it makes all the sense since it can only quest... then it is really a great card, I believe, especially, once you get the Pipe.

I forgot to mention that. If you do not use him in combat, what better than exhaust him for Word of Command (an in sphere 1 cost event). The only little thing is I usually play the event in planning, but here I think it is worth the wait.

I'm not sure it has one willpower, even though I think a quest-only ally with 0 wp is odd, since there's nothing else it can do.  But it's guaranteed card draw with Gandalf hero, and can be with Imladris Stargazer or Radagast/Wizard Pipe, so maybe the ability is all it has.

Also, judging by the beautiful art of the white dear (or is it an elk, I am not good at this) next to Radagast in the article, could this be a Spirit Creature ally in this pack? I have a feeling we might get a creature ally in every sphere. I was hoping there could be another Beorning as there were only two in the cycle but as suggested above the Tactics event would hint more toward an Eagle, though a unique one at that, that may be harder to find; then again they may just come up with an original name.

Amazing! Finally we get him as a hero! Eagles are my favourite deck to play and this guy alongside Bormir and another tactics hero will be my new go to favourite squad I think.

 

Very much looking forward to this one and hoping that it's hinting at the next cycle being istari/creature related. Blue wizards maybe?

So now that we have an Istari with a sphere, what do you think Hero Saruman would be? 

Tactics I'd say is right out.

Lore seems like the perfect sphere for Istari, but Radagast has that sphere already, so I think that decreases the chances. 

Leadership could make sense as he is the head of the Istari and the White Council.

Spirit could potentially work as well, but I think the fact that he will likely raise threat like his ally card will rule this out as Spirit is great at threat reduction.

Neural could still work too.

What I would love to see for Saruman: 

After your threat is raised by a player card effect, reduce your threat by 1 and ready Saruman, limit once per phase.

 

 

And for his equipment:

Staff if Saruman: Exhaust Saruman and staff of Saruman to search the top 5 cards of your deck for an event card, play that card for no cost, that card gains Doomed X where X is that cards printed cost.

 

This way he synergizes with all of the Voices of Isenguard events, event cards in general and Grima and Palantir.

Tactics Boromir would be a good friend for this Saruman indeed.

> 9 hours ago, sappidus said:

Would be a nice bonus to bring Boromir back power-wise even though mostly helpful in the combat-phase. But could also make it once per round if they would be too strong together, or just make it "after raising your threat from a player card Doomed effect" and you would only lose the Palantir. The latter idea might even be a better fix then he only combos with Grima and the Doomed cards.

Though after recently battling Saruman boss in the saga edition he should be a multi-action powerhouse, chucking spells left and right, playing dangerously close with your threat and doing nothing to drop the threat of your allied players. 

Anyways that's my hope, would be pretty cool to have a team of Saruman/Grima synergizing with Gandalf, Galadrial or Elrond for some Hobbit cinema-verse recreations. Or even just to show what would have happened if Saruman accepted Gandalf's offer and helped against the great enemy. 

We will see what Caleb and FFG do but they have full permission to use this idea as a base haha. I just want to see whatever Saruman comes out, being able to synergize with the Voices of Isenguard cards and especially his ally Grima.

Oh and a final thought, he really needs to have ranged.

I feel, if we are going to get more Istari, it is more likely we get 2 Blue Wizzards as heroes in the next deluxe, though they might have to name them differently due rights, right? Spirit and Tactics would feel natural to them as a pair. That said, now that we have Radagast as a hero, it is hard to imagine not to get Saruman as well, but perhaps he may come as Leadership in the first adventure pack. It would be quite cool to suddenly get 4 Istari heroes in a row, would it not?

 

PS. What is the guess about the creatures, all spheres? And all spheres already in the Fate of Wilderland?

I was thinking about a hero version of Saruman, and I had an interesting idea:

 

Saruman

14 Threat/2 WP/4 Attack/3 Defense/5 HP

Action: Reveal the top card of your deck. You may give it Doomed 3 and spend a resource from Saruman's resource pool to put it into play. Otherwise, remove it from the game. Limit once per round.

Forced: At the start of the refresh phase, reveal the top card of your deck and raise your threat by X, where X is the printed cost of the card plus 1. Then remove it from the game.

 

Saruman's Staff

3 cost

Attach to Saruman. Restricted

When playing a card with the Doomed keyword, Saruman is considered to have the printed Tactics, Leadership, Spirit, and Lore icons.

Response: After you raise your threat from a player card effect, exhaust Saruman's Staff to choose one of the following options: Ready Saruman and reduce your threat by 1, deal 2 damage to an enemy in play, or give Saruman +2 willpower, attack, or defense until the end of the phase.

@Onidsen [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/294647-onidsen/] that's certainly the tale of two extremes. On one hand, you're thinning your deck pretty quickly (and permanently), and without gandalf/scrying you are gambling leaving cards on top of your deck. It does invite the use of Wizard Pipe, which I like. Gandalf + saruman is also a dangerous play, since those two alone are 28 (or 29 if we believe the card not the text). Plus they are both neutral, so it almost forces an all doomed deck, or some crazy istari focus build. A third hero is nearly impossible in a standard game, so forget bringing the three istari heroes for a solo round.

That being said, as dangerous a play he is, the staff radically balances it. I don't think the reduction by 1 is nearly enough (considering you are raising your threat by at least two every round), but the direct damage and the boost is insane. I could imagine putting Unexpected Courage on him and raising his stats during combat -- making him the best defender (1 better than beregond) and best attacker (1 better than beorn) in the game simaltaneously. I might be okay running with just two heroes at that point, something I've never attempted.

He is very different! Interesting enough that I might proxy him in a solo match and see what he's like. Well done!

Cool  artwork! And I like that you went with neutral. I think we are similar wavelengths with him being able to add Doomed to cards to basically evil Vilya them. Plus synergy with the doomed event cards is great and again both of us are angling on. 

I like that you made yours more of a fighter though and in general I really love your staff! My only concern is the removing cards from your deck like crazy. I think discarding it or putting it on the bottom would be two nicer and simpler options. But all in all great cards!

I would like if Saruman’s Staff dealt damage to enemies, yes, that seems appropriate. Some sort of resource accelaration (reduction, just like the others). And maybe scrying? Though that goes more with the Palantir... then rather meddling with the discard deck perhaps.

I really think it would be better to go for three more hero Istari now, and make one for each sphere plus neutral Gandalf we already have. It is common knowledge they were five. So I am holding my breath for the Blue ones in the next deluxe.

 These are some very old Saruman-themed cards I made. They lack art, though. 

Saruman (neutral)

15 threat cost

2 wp

4 atk

3 def

5 hp

Istari.

Play with the top card of the encounter deck faceup. If that card is an enemy, Saruman gains a tactics resource icon. If that card is a location, Saruman gains a lore resource icon. If that card is a treachery, Saruman gains a spirit resource icon.

Forced: At the end of the round, raise your threat by 2.

 

Saruman's staff (neutral attachment) Cost 1

Item. Staff. 

Doomed 2

Attach to Saruman.

Saruman gains the leadership resource icon.

Action: Exhaust Saruman's staff too (choose 1); deal a damage to an enemy in play, place a progress token on a location in play or cancel a when revealed effect on a treachery. That card gains doomed three.

 

Of the Many Colours (neutral attachment)

Cost 0

Title. 

 Doomed 5

Attach to a Istari hero.

Attached hero gains the Leadership, Lore, Tactics and Spirit resource icon.

 

Thoughts: 

Saruman should be neutral. My idea is that Gandalf helps you, Saruman is more aggressive (the staff places progress/damages enemies instead of drawing cards etc.). The maia himself should raise your threat, it's the mechanic of Isengard. He should also be more combat-oriented (hence the 2/4/3/5 stat line). 

There is a quote (I don't have the book at hand right now) about Saruman, where Gandalf says that Saruman was key to the White Council always being a step ahead of Sauron (which they weren't). The sorting mechanic represents that knowledge. 

The title attachment should be attachable to each Istari, anyone of them could have fallen. 

Thoughts? 

(Sorry for my bad English, I'm not a native English speaker, and on my phone).

@DurinVoronwe [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/257765-durinvoronwe/]. That strikes me as a little too high in terms of threat generation. Combined with Gandalf, that's 29 starting threat with a guaranteed 3 threat increase at the end of each round. That means (barring card effects that increase or decrease threat) that you will only have 7 rounds to complete most scenarios. Add to the picture that you will only have two heroes, this strikes me as a very hard duo to justify. That could just be me though.

I love the encounter deck mechanic though. I could see increasing his cost by 2 or 3 threat, dropping the automatic threat increase, and adding to his line that at the end of the quest phase if the top card of the encounter deck has a shadow effect, he does not exhaust to defend. I don't know if this would be overpowered or not though.

To cancel when revealed with the Staff would be great, and to combine it with doomed is a clever idea, too. I just feel that 3 is a bit too much, though I understand this more as an emergency.

I mostly agree, with the following corrections: Loyal Hound must be discarded to prevent damage, not exhausted.

The Great Hunt is instead "You must spend resources from 3 different heroes' pools to pay for this card. COMBAT ACTION: Choose and discard a non-unique enemy from the staging area"

Those are the rules corrections, I think the Shirrif ally is going to be "Shirriff of Bywater".

Mithril shirt is really good. No exhaustion, so a hero could take damage from staging, archery and combat and zero it out all in one round.

The other cards look decent and fair. Good synergy with istari. Thanks Lordbird!

I can't be the only one who's feels that the title The Return of the King on a Thorin themed card, even if it technically fits, is kinda awkward. Still, thanks @LordBird [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/333840-lordbird/] for translating, and these cards all look good, particularly Reforged. Has to be one of my favorite cards in the cycle. All around excellent pack, finally bringing Radagast hero, this is something I had been waiting for for years.

Interesting choices with Reforged. I often was considering a deck with Spirit Glorfindel without Lore but was missing Asfaloth in there. Maybe with this card, he can be cheated into play like I used to cheat out of sphere allies with Stand and Fight during the core set years. Elven Spear probably needed to discard it first.

And thanks, I always forget that, out of excitement from the new content. As often, they saved the best for last in the cycle, it seems. The Raven with Wizzard Pipe is just amazing, and now Radagast will need a smoke just as much as Gandalf. The Shirt is my favourite guarded card also because it produces a location which I never fear as much as enemies. But both Sting and Mithril Shirt are great in that that you know what you are getting. I just wish there was an Eagle or Beorning... hopefully later.

Wow, with no offence to the few surviving members, how else if I am myself included, whether the game is dying or not, this community is well dead and buried. I remember days when if the new pack was spoiled there would be maybe five pages of responses within ten hours, now there are five pieces.

Yes forum activity is at an all-time low.

Join the Facebook group to see multiple posts per day, or the Cardboard of the Rings discord server to see a continuous scroll of chatter about this kind of thing.  FFG and BGG forms are pretty quiet these days, there still there is a lot of talk going on about the game. It has just moved to a different place.

Spirit glorfindel with asfaltoh without the need to play lore seems really unfair.  You just need to put it into the discard pile which in spirit seems quite easy to accomplish considering eowyn and arwen  abilities plus cards like to the sea, to the sea...

You could already use Good Harvest for Lore-less Asfaloth, although Reforged in the setting of Arwen does save you a card.

Reforged is handy for mining decks.  Or with Erestor decks.  Off-sphere attachments are more interesting than off-sphere allies, so in that respect it's more interesting than Stand and Fight.  (Stand and Fight is more useful for reviving dead chacters, of course.)

The Great Hunt is a fairly narrow card, since it only works in the combat stage.  Though it combos well with the events (two in Lore) that prevent an enemy from making engagement checks.  That could come in handy in quests with powerful non-unique, non-immune enemies.

Bywater Sherrif is nice Cotton fodder, he can come in and attack for four.  Not bad for 2 resources.

I like Return of the King and so will TaBilbo.

The rest we've already seen.

True, but really Asfaloth is not as amazing as it once was. Location control has so many options these days. Reforged is just generally an exciting card to see for all kinds of uses.

The Great Hunt seems to be a useful corner case card for some saga quests, where you may well want to discard enemies you are avoiding (any and all mumaks...). A nice addition to mono-Lore encounter control decks, I think.

Gwaihir's Debt is also a nice addition to Eagles decks. Now that Radagast can help play them this is a form of draw to complement The Eagles are Coming! I'm way behind on playing at the moment (still struggling through Roam Across Rhovanion) but this is making me think I need to get a move on!

With Radagast and Wizard's Pipe, you can put core Gandalf on your deck, pull it out with Gwaihir's Debt, put him in play and get him for the entire round before he returns back to your hand.

True, there are more options now which does make Asfaloth less unique but it is still an amazing card. And really much better (on Glorfindel) than most other location control cards, in most cases in which I run into.

Yes, we knew that one already but it is an amazing card, and combo, just as the Raven. The creature deck got real.

Yes, Shirrif is great target for Cotton and Raise the Shire.

I feel you might underestimate the value of the Hunt. I think it is a great boost for mono Lore decks. Getting rid of Mumaks like that?

## 102 [dalestephenson on April 15, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/290618-the-fate-of-wilderland/?do=findComment&comment=3679444)

Great for Mumaks and Ringwraiths.  Great for disposing of that initial Hill Troll on Journey Down the Anduin.  But I see it more as a sideboard card that's handy in certain quests instead of a general-purpose card that you'd always want in a mono-lore deck.  Low-threat mono-lore decks would probably always want it, though.

The Hunt is great. I feel any monolore (or with songs) deck I make will include it, unless my threat is too high. Target removal is a nice thing to have even for enemies that aren't big ticket items like mumaks. Sometimes you just rather get rid of an enemy that popped up at the wrong place and the wrong time. Compared to Fierce Defense, I feel this is less limited, or at least there seems to be more variety in decks of monolore with low threat than straight up valour decks to build around.

I feel the same way. I was really excited about Fierce Defence and got disappointed. Maybe I will be here too, but I am super excited now. Maybe it is a style of play. It feels similar to the card like Gildor’s Counsel. Some People never play it but I swear by it. I feel you usually have to spend more than three resources to get rid of an enemy in a mono Lore deck, especially a heavy one.

Thanks for the translation! I'm eagerly awaiting getting Ragadast and this pack added to my Legolas and Boromir Eagle deck! Some very cool cards. And the Hunt event is awesome as well for the usually not as combat heavy Lore (with the exception of Treebeard, that guy don't care about any enemy's defense).

I think I will put Radagast together with Beorn and a Leadership hero, probably Theodred, for extra resources and lower threat. Questing might be an issue but it should play fast. In saga, you will be able to play the Staff and Eagles of the Misty Mountains round 1, for instance.

Do you plan to play it in solo or multiplayer? 

Radagast seems great for an eagle deck maybe along with mablung. Between mablung ability and radagast staff resources should not be an issue and green will feed tons of card draw and fetching options to make sure you have always cards to play. Becouse of built in resource smothening any low cost hero in both lore or tactic can act as third with some deck adjustment.

Well, I am almost certain it will be great in coop, as Beorn Eagles deck tends to, but I want to also try it solo, which has always struggled. I expressed myself wrong perhaps, I mostly choose Theodred and Leadership not because of resources but for cards like Tale and Sneak to bring Eagles and even Giant Bears into play easier (the latter is amazing with the Sneak, almost as good as Gandalf with his double action and great stats).

Ok. Then maybe new Gildor hero or old good balin would be a better option than theodred.  They would put spare leadership resources to good use strenghtening  key areas like card draw or shadow cancellation and provide higher willpower.

Cool ideas with the resource adding, I usually play with my wife and she has forever claimed the Steward of Gondor so alas I must find other ways to pay for my pricey Eagles and attachments.

Currently I run Lelolas, Boromir and Elrond together and as long as you get Vilya and a stargazer into play you quickly get to play what you need. Radagast ally and wizard pipe is just icing on the cake in case you already drew the expensive cards. 

I like the Lore/Tactica pairing and I think there is no better hero then Boromir to play with the Eagles for multi-attacks. It will be nice to swap out Elrond for something new and the theme nl is going to be awesome

All good perhaps, yes. I still have a soft spot for Theodred but I may try them all. It is true he would only be adding to Radagast’s resources, thus be a little limited. Both Balin and Gildor are very good, better quester, though slightly more threat costly.

Encounter sets used apart from the Fate of Wilderland set are all from The Wilds of Rhovanion deluxe expansion: Grey Mountain Goblins, Hills of Wilderland and Gathering Gloom.

I'm also a bit curious to know if the quest finishes like those of the last cycles, connecting (and telling the name of the next Deluxe) the story.

And if so, how they are connected?

Spoiler tagged, of course 😊.

We continue down our path of acting in unethical ways and head out to bring the Southron Refugees to the Temple of Doom in Rhun as a sacrificial offering.

That would be a nice final twist! 😂

I'm pretty sure lots of people are interested, lol. Certainly for player card pictures.

Well we already got the French version of them all so I was not sure it would still be something of interest, but ok I will publish them as soon as I can.

Some great art on these, Reforged, the King’s Return or Gwaihir’s Debt, especially.

I just finished playing (succesfully) my first attemp against this quest and I have to say I am really satisfied by it (and by the cycle in general, especially from a narrative point). I always enjoyed the big battle quests and I feel the mechanics were really on spot for this one. Kudos to the developers I am really getting the sense they are improving with each cycle lately.

Not seeing an article by FFG, but this has been updated to “Shipping Now” on their upcoming page.

So with the final pack of this cycle coming out soon, what do people think is the probability that The Shadow of the East will be available at GenCon?

I would like to believe it but I kinda don't.

My guess is not a chance.

Gamenerdz has expected release date to be June 6th. They're usually pretty accurate so that should be the date it arrives for most!

I hope it comes out soon! I've been buying generally in progression style except for Sagas, but I will make an exception for this pack! Eagles are my favourite playstyle and this set competes it!

I'm sure many of you have seen -- it's in stores now!

I have to wait until I head south again to pick it up as no store in town carries it. But excited!
