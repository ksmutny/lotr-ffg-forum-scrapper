# [Eagles of the Misty Mountains + Support of the Eagles](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/124251-eagles-of-the-misty-mountains-support-of-the-eagles/)

Spent some time today building two decks using core and Shadows of Mirkwood cards. Ended up with hopefully a pretty decent Eagles deck, and a promising Rohan deck. Then, just to check them, I played 2p a couple of times the introductory scenario and this situation arose:

 

- Eagles of the Misty Mountains had 2 eagles as attachment, hence its attack was 4, and the defense was 4

- Legolas has Support of the Eagles attached, and I wanted him to gain the defense bonus of Eagles of the Misty Mountains

 

should he gain +2 Defense (unmodified Eagles) or +4 (modified stats due to the two attachments)?

 

Many thanks :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

+4

Eagles of the Misty Mountains's effect is passive, so permanent.

Yup, if it was the printed value, it would use the word "printed" on the card.  As it does not, you get the current value of the Eagle's defense.

That's SO lovely! The card is rather strong, then!

 

Thanks for the instant replies, guys! Just in time, after dinner we should play some more!

Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand the decks seem to work :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

Beat twice in a row Journey down the Anduin, and the second game was epic: started with Marsh Adder, Dol Guldur Beastmaster and one of the two Trolls in the staging area; had a card raising my threat immediately, so the troll got engaged (*puzzled* an engaged troll? not to me I hope! :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]) and during questing in round two the *second* troll joined the party.

 

Passed through all of this with relative ease. Stomped the Eastern Blights and stage two and brought home victory.

 

Curious to test them with Dol-Guldur. Hopefully tomorrow.

I myself play almost every time eagles when i´m using tactics.

 

Some time ago i played Conflict At The Carrock and at the end of the game Glorfindel had 3 Support of the eagles and then i had Misty Mountain Eagles with 4 cards under it, so Glorfindel finally beated up the final troll with 21 power :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

But i think that Support Of The Eagles should have text "Limit one per hero", then it wouldn´t be so op card.

 

And by the way Julia, if you have enough time and you remeber those decks you used when playing Anduin quest, can you post them here because i like to test decks that other people uses :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

21 resources on the final round? It's four Gandalf, and a coffee. Man, I'm impressed :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

Indeed. I never considered giving the same hero more than one Support of the Eagles, but you're right, there's nothing against it. Still, call me dumb, but I'd not give two or three of them to the very same hero. It sounds so wrong to me.

 

As for the deck... I'll PM you about that.

Resources? Did you misread something or what do you mean with resources?

Maybe I didn't get a passage in your post, then. You meant an attack strength of 21? (could also match: each time you use Support of the Eagles you add +6 due to the combo you had in play at that time; hence, 18, + 3 base attack is 21. Sorry, still making up with the jargon)

" with 21 power" Not really jargon, but he just means attackpower.
