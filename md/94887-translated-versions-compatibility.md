I have the Greek version of core set and all the other AP and saga boxes in English and yes it is fully compatible and playable

 

But I believe you can find it in English, can't you ?

Man, I would love to have a Greek version of the core set... I would not understand a thing but I know what all the card do, and the Greek alphabet is so pretty.

First of all welcome to this great game (adelfe ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] ) and second, yes the Greek version is fully compatible with the english, i have all the english boxes (core to season 3 nightmare packs) and the 2 Greek boxes (core and first hobbit) and i'm having a blast with them :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Hmm, thinking about it, maybe not a whole core set, but just the heroes. It'd be more special. A greek language Legolas or Aragorn would be great :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]
