# [(Glorfindel&#039;s) Healing Ability, etc.](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46808-glorfindels-healing-ability-etc/)

 Hey Guys!

New to the forum, great game, I must say - very challening in solo mode and very much fun!

How does the healing ability of Glorfindel work exactly - in the combat phase - is the damage dealt at once - or one damage point after another, leaving a short time frame in between, so that Glorfindel can use his ability? e.g. Gloin has 1 hp left, receives 1 damage point from an attack - can I use Glorfindel inbetween to heal him - or Lore of Imladris or Beorn's Hospitality for that matter.... or Daughter of Nimrodel?

 

Second question: I can safely assume - out of common sense - that items attached to heroes are discarded to their respective owner's discard pile once the hero is eliminated? I can therefore also assume that allies are not "attached" to heroes and remain in play whilst a hero perishes?

 

Thanks,

 

Vyron

Would want to heal him before he takes the last damage and dies.

Allies are characters, just like heroes. They just don't get resource tokens.

For healing, you can play actions at the end of each combat step, so you could heal someone after a shadow card has been resolved but before damage is applied.

This should allow you to heal at just the right time in most cases, but be warned if a shadow effect deals direct damage that kills the character, you have no opportunity to prevent that through healing

 meaning that if hummerhorns deals its forced 5 damage points and I assign them to e.g. aragorn, I can't use Glorfindels ability to keep him alive?

Right. You want to kill the Hummerhorns before they ever engage you.

unless you've Citadel Plated somebody. But yeah, it's better to off them in the staging area.

Wait, you can "interrupt" heal? Or does it just matter which phase or how the damage is done? I always thought you had to have your healing done before any damage came up. Like say someone has 3 damage and 4 HP. If something showed up that did 2 damage, they would die before you could heal and keep them alive? Or am I wrong?

I definitely understand damage is done as a lump, not 1 point at a time, unless its separate sources.

You can´t interrrupt damage but in most cases you will know about the damage before it happens. The exception is cards that are revealed from the encounter deck. They are resolved as they are revealed. Since combat is resolved in several steps, you can see the damage you will receive before you receive it, and so can heal damage to prepare yourself (you can play actions between all steps in combat).

Hummerhorns are pain if they come late. Otherwise, Dunhere is the man to deal with them. If not playing him (which is a mistake), use Gandalf.

As for the question, there needs to be a damage token on a character that Glorfindel can heal, he cannot heal anything that is applied during the resolution of the attack. It is not Magic. It is Elvish. And though Elvish Magic is obviously the best, it is fair to the game and does not cheat.

Hummerhorn says that when "hummerhorn engages a player...."

Does his forced ability still apply when the player engages the hummerhorn?

Yes hummerhorns still does the damage to a hero (or is it character?) of your choice. I think the official rules faq stated it but I think it would have been nice for them to say '~ engages a player or is engaged by a player' so that certain cards only have a special effect if they engage and other cards only have an effect if they are engaged by a player. Just a personal thing.

From the rule book.

"Whether an enemy is engaged through an engagement check, through a card effect, or through a player’s choice, the end result is the same, with the enemy and the player engaging one another. In all cases, the player is considered to have engaged the enemy and the enemy is considered to have engaged the player."
