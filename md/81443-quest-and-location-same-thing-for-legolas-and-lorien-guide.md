# [Quest and Location - same thing for Legolas and Lorien Guide?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/81443-quest-and-location-same-thing-for-legolas-and-lorien-guide/)

Just wanted a second opinion on Legolas and Lorien Guide's abilites. Legolas can place progress markers on the current Quest, the Guide can place markers on the active location.

1. If there is an active location, does legolas put markers on this, or are they put on the Quest card? (we've been playing that they go on the location first)

2. If there is no active location, does the Lorien Guide place a marker on the Quest card (again, we've been playing it this way)

Cheers.

1 Since active location work as a buffer for quest card so yes if there is active location legolas ability will put tokens first on active location as much as needed.

2 guide cannot put tokens on a quest card. So if there is no active location, guide ability is just wasted. No tokens on the quest card!
