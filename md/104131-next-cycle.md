Where do you guys think the next cycle will take place?  Places already been:

 

Gondor

Rohan

Misty Mountains

Mirkwood

Isengard

Dunland/Enedwaith/Minhiriath (The current cycle)

 

Places still to go:

Harad/Umbar (possible)

The Shire (Possible but I don't think it would be directly in the Shire)

Grey Mountains (Too boring of a place though I think)

Far East (Maybe?)

Mordor (unlikely)

Or they might finally go up north into Belariand (however you spell it.

 

Personally, I think they aren't going to go out of Middle Earth.  I think the next cycle is going to be down south in Middle Earth.  Probably Harad.  One reason behind this is there are very few Haradrim Enemy's so far.

 

What do you guys think?

I guess/hope for Arnor/Angmar/northern Eriador - focused on the Dunedain.

Northern Eriador, Barrow-Downs, Angmar, the Ice Bay of Forochel etc would be my first guess. Also the Far East, Harad, Rhun, etc as second, maybe a little bit of liberty for the devs here for them to make fictional cities and the Blue Wizards which would be awesome.

Do they have the freedom to invent new content in that way? (The blue wizards)

The blue wizards are not covered by the license FFG has (Middle-earth Enterprises), but are instead held by the Tolkien Estate. A previous game, Middle Earth CCG, managed to get the rights to the blue wizard names by special permission. Anyway, aside from referencing the blue wizards specifically, I think they are pretty free to make up content however they please (I mean, most of the coming cycle is made up, albeit using existing locations).

And yet Lotr tcg from Decipher had characters names Alatar and Pallando, though it wans't showing them explicitly, like many other WETA characters.

Ah, I never played that one so wasn't aware of it. I looked into it and it looks like they tried to get around it by using the moth pictures and implying that the moths were named Alatar and Pallando. I'm no lawyer, but in my opinion, that was a violation of the license, but I guess they got away with it! Not sure if FFG would take the risk or not.

Agreed with jjeagle. Arnor-Dunedain-Hero Halbarad. My most ardent wishes.

Northern Eriador COULD have also another Hero I would love to see , and would never fit anywhere else ... Cirdan  ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

You're forgetting that heroes do not necessarily (although I think it's be better if they did) have to go with the location in which the cycle takes place. They're supposed to be just random heroes from middle earth, even though in some packs they have done it the other way.

## 15 [Nickpes on April 18, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/104131-next-cycle/?do=findComment&comment=1054141)

Indeed, but since Cirdan is not a such well known character, i guess that a cycle located near the Havens would give him more chances to appear

I'm all up for this! Angmar here we come! Let's raid Fornost & Carn Dum!

What is with Lórien?

I would personally like to adventure in the North around the Beornings (and get card support to match). So far I really don't know what to imagine for the beorning cards - We don't have much to go on. Beorn himself gets a bear form and a really powerful attack (he and Gimili are probably tied on who can do the best attack) - he is exceptional. On the other hand the only other Beorning card is a decent attack card too, but otherwise effects the staging area for a single (weak) hit on many enemies.

Which implies that Beornings should be good at dealing damage (seems fairly obvious), both as a decent attack and by special effects. Mostly the cards would be tactics but I really think that having all the cards of one type in a single sphere (like the eagles) is a mistake - I can see it working for the eagles but I think the Beornings would need to be in two spheres at least, so what would you put with tactics?

I think Lore would actually make the best fit for the other Beornings sphere, as Beorn's Hospitality is there already, and you could say Beorn had plenty of knowledge about the wild and animals. With that in mind, I think the Beornings could be paired with a bunch of animal allies with the creature trait.

I like this thinking (I rejected leadership and felt spirit didn't fit, but I was trying to think how Lore did fit) - In which case what other creatures would you like to see, do you think that bears (which apparently all Beornings can talk too) would be a lore animal?

I like the idea of getting some dogs and bears in Lore to work with Beorn/Beornings (and to boost Radagast)
