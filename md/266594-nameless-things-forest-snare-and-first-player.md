# [Nameless Things, Forest Snare, and First Player](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/266594-nameless-things-forest-snare-and-first-player/)

I have a couple questions about Foundations of Stone:

1) If one of the nameless things attaches a forest snare to itself, will it be able to attack? The snare is technically "attached."

2) The converse, If I play a snare on a thing and, will it increase it's health and (now superfluous) attack?

3) Entirely unrelated, but once the players advance to stage four, are there now multiple first players? Does the first player token still switch? How would Goblin Follower resolve (I assume there is still a last player, which is the only player at each stage)?

Thanks

1 is yes. From the FAQ:

> Q: If a card is attached to Nameless Thing (D 125) as part of the resolution of its Forced effect, is that card’s game text active? A: No. Cards that are attached to Nameless Thing (or Elder Nameless Thing) as a result of triggering its Forced effect are considered attachments with no card title or game text. The only active part of the attached card is its cost.

As for your question about multiple first players, the answer is yes.  There was a ruling long ago that each staging area has its own first player.  Let me see if I can find it..

Here is the original post, it's verrry old now but I'm not aware of any contradictory rulings:
