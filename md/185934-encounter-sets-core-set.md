Hi!
I was wondering if there is someone out there who with multiple core sets who wouldn't mind getting rid of some of the encounter sets.

Looking for the following:

Spiders of Mirkwood x1
Dol Guldur Orcs x2
Saurons Reach x1
Wilderlands x1

Â 

Let me know :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
