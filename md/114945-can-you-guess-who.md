An ally. Non-unique.

Cost: 3

Willpower: 4

Attack: 2

Defense: 1

Health: 3

No rules, so I'll say we can have anything in play... That would mean it could be anything.

You need to specify the context at least or this is like «guess the next number in the series» with «1, 2, 3, ?».

But might be fun if you define the rules.

This ally is already released. His stats are obviously not printed, but boosted through the already released measures too.

## 5 [alogos on August 27, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/114945-can-you-guess-who/?do=findComment&comment=1227778)

Well, could be anything like I said...

I'll guess he have no attachment, since nor am I a stranger + sword of morthond is only for fun.

Then I am player A with 3 spirit printed heroes and player B has Boromir II with Visionary Leader.

It is a Pelargir Shipwright.

Other possibility :

Same without Boromir, but player B send me a spirit printed hero with desesperate alliance and someone has played grave cairn for +1 on him.

Other possibility :

Same but player B send me aragorn with sword that was broken and Boromir II with a resource. (not that much attack boost available)

It could be pratically any 3 cost ally this way...

9 are available for the people of midle earth to use

1 for the dwarf, selfish in their cavern

1 for the cheerful who fear not death

1 for the gloomy who embrace death

2 for the strong willed may they help other to find their way safe

4 for the ones that are since the begining, sharing what they have

 

what are they ?

> The song cards!

 

Maybe...

 

- Currently there are 10 Song cards, not 9 (O Lorien was recently added, so there's a possibility it could have been missed).

- 1 for the Dwarf makes sense, since there's Durin Song that can be used on a Dwarf and gives a lot of stats and can be viewed as selfish.

- 1 for the cheerful who fear not death could potentially be talking about Song of Mocking. I wouldn't consider Bilbo exactly  cheerful at that point though.

- 1 for the gloomy who embrace death could only be Fall of Gil-Galad, though I would say the word "embrace" is a bit strong in this case. It certainly lessens the blow though.

- Skipping ahead to the last one: 4 for the ones that are since the beginning... This would obviously be the 4 main songs from the first cycle, but honestly they are for more than just the heroes that came in the beginning.

- 2 for the strong-willed... Sounds to me like this is talking about songs that boost willpower, though there is only one. In that case it could just be referring to the Spirit sphere, in which case it makes sense. One specifically helps other players, which goes for "may they help others to find their way safe", but I don't see how Lay of the Nimrodel really matches that description.

 

Anyway, I could see this going either way.

Skeez is right.

 

Lay of Nimrodel was a little short of helping other, but boosting quest in multiplayer help others in a way.

Well, if people want it to stay in game, it should go, so I'll say Gandalf. As he is unique, it fit the second part.

Yes, Arwen. ^^

 

Faramir (in Blood Gondor and Morgul Vale) also could be. But people likes much more Arwen, less expensive, 2wp and +1def and centinel... Everybody wants her

However, in Road to Rivendel or Redhorn Gate can`t be played because she is yet in play. Sometimes you remember it when you have her in deck, or even in hand.

 

Cheers!

You are right about being 6 now (in game)...

 

So Istari are out of the question....

 

Both those Lords didn't "just arrived"

Could be but all his sons Elladan, Elrohir and Arwen are Noldor in game, but they could be Sylvan from their mother part.

Elrond is not a the center of anything ? maybe elrond counsil, well, ok, but noldor and sylvan brothers "in cards" not in lore.

Third is about lore, not about cards. Don't know what is black and white for Elrond here...

Fourth... well, not really. Healing is not when losing hope and not about a shield...

Somebody didn't liked lack of reasoning on my previous right guess, so I'll break this one down for you:

 

"I'm the watcher at the center" -Gatekeeper. Also, geographical position of Orthanc.

"I'm a man with Sylvan and Noldor brothers" -Came out in a deluxe expansion where Noldor and Silvan traits started to get explored further.

"I work for black and white alike" -Saruman is White, but his soul is Black. Or Black is a Sauron, for whom Saruman works.

"When you lose hope, I'll be your shield" -Readies when Doomed card is played, best for defense.

## 81 [alogos on September 3, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/114945-can-you-guess-who/?do=findComment&comment=1245461)

"at the center" is also because orthanc is in the center of isengard.

"brothers" refered to Watcher of the Bruinen and the new Sylvan Ally that shares the common ability to be able to block more than once.

"black" was for the tower of Orthanc

I'll wait with my riddle until Mndela's has been guessed.

And I'll guess too: I almost would go for Splorfindel, but the second line doesn't fit in really well,

joezim is ok ^^. It is Vilya:

 

1. I hate when new players put Vilya into game claiming 'i have vilya!' and they use elrond to discard a.... aaagh! Test of Will (or something similar). In adittion, if they dont have vilya in hand, his deck becomes useless.

2. Point 2 is the same side. It can give you happy moments (a Beorn ally for free, Gildor, etc.), but also epic fails (Test of Will ,etc...)

3. It is ok for each sphere cause it is neutral, but can't be in almost all cards, because it only can be attached on Elrond.

Anfalas Herdsman

 

"Of the mightiest the weakest. First alone and crippled, now a green prince of the peasants."

 

He's Outlands, so he fits "of the mightiest". Could be considered "the weakest" of the Outlands cards. At "first" he's "crippled" if he's "alone" because all he has is hit points, which is mostly useless. He's Lore so he's "green" and he's a herdsman, which is generally considered a "peasant".

Nope. A lampwright doesn't betray his own "name" by not guarding you, though he does fight agaknst the shadow. You are somewhat close though!

Guard of the Citadel is a fine quester and attacker in a Gondor deck, plus if he is chump blocking, he IS guarding you. The ally we seek here very blocks.

Very nicely found, but not correct ;-)

It fits almost perfectly with this description, some doubt are in line 1 and 4.

Line 1: Saruman's thrust is not with the Elves. Despite he was leader of the white council.

Line 4: I don't see why a single player wouldn't have paid it? Sure in multi player all take his doom.

Let me add the following to it: 

The perspective of speech if just from the card itself. Not necessarily a person.

Gildor's Counsel comes to mind, but it's not an ally.

Hmmm hard one indeed. Radagast comes to mind, for his high cost, living neae Elves and trusting them. Even wise for being a member of the order and the council... But mehh..

## 155 [Jban on September 8, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/114945-can-you-guess-who/?do=findComment&comment=1254166)

Since the correct answer has been mentioned, let me clarify my reasoning.

> Gildor's Counsel comes to mind, but it's not an ally.

 

The answer was indeed Gildor's counsel,

 

 * Among the elves my thrust lies

Gildor's counsel is based upon one of our well known Noldors, Gildor himself.

 * for many people I might even sound wise

It is counsel after all

 * There are not many games where you could see me played

I rarely see this card be used by other players.

 

 * But that's because no single player has ever paid

Referring to solo-play. In solo play this card is pretty useless.

Maby for next time, try to get the type in since it might be confusing ^^. Hope you enjoyed it (incl. rhime)

You can use it on a 2nd stage of Journey Down the Anduin, for example.

Here's something different:

As long as Dain exists, this card will never be played as it is almost completely redundant.

I'm a very big fan of the card but because it's use in solo play is very limited, guess you mention one of the few exceptions.

Others might be Steward's Fear (with the proper plot) and Dungeon's deep and Cavern's Dim.

Ah, I see what you mean by single player, solo would have perhaps been more clear. I thought it meant the cost was played by more than one player.

I have the feeling we are leaning toward our Leadership variant of Boromir.

ffg_boromir-hon.jpg [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/ffg_boromir-hon.jpg]

Same cost, same sphere, +1 attack to certain trait, (dwarven synergy > gondor synergy)

But Dain boosts willpower as well, so my first thoughts are on Boromir who needs a attachment for this as well.

But I'll think some more about it.

The card we are looking for could theoretically complement Dain, but is ultimately rendered pointless because Dain is so strong.

Untroubled is a really great card! I control Dain with a Lore/Leadership deck in KD and my co-player played this card with his Spirit/Tactics. We quested with 5 Dwarves and that gave us a total of 23 will. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

## 168 [Jban on September 9, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/114945-can-you-guess-who/?do=findComment&comment=1255661)

I do play that card very frequently, so therefore didn't submit it. (Fatty - Nori - Thorin, uses it rather frequently)

And i do think many heroes are very useful because they are different from one another. But Dain and Le-Boro are like the same but a weaker version with a different way of triggering the effect.

Awaiting next riddle, might make 1 myself

A = "he" / "green"

B = "they".

 

A is alone.

B comes, so A is gone.

B then leaves and comes back, so A comes back.

 

WHAT!?!?! :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

 

... or are "he" and "green" two separate things? Line 2 says green was no more, but then line 3 says "he" returned.

 

Sounds like A is Elrond with Vilya. "Disappear" means exhaust. "Return" means ready. Elrond and Vilya exhaust to bring in an ally (B). Later B exhausts to do something. Then A and B ready at the refresh phase.

"First he was alone, in the green
Then they came and the green was no more
They disappeared and after they returned, he did also"

 

Hunter of Lamedon is Lore (Green) Outlands ally. You could also achieve full "Green" environment by playing monolore with Elrond, who can then bring in allies of any sphere.

Then, regular Outlands allies of other spheres drop in, so Lore is mixed in with other spheres.

Then, some vile treachery kills all the Outlands allies, and all of them, including Hunter of Lamedon, are brought back with Men of the West.

 

That's my weird reading of it which is obviously not right.

Yeah, Mirkwood it is!

Radagast is the character. He had his house there, the Woodmen came, Sauron and his Orcs(they) came to Greenwood the Great and it became Mirkwood. The White Council drove Sauron away, but the Orcs returned during the War of the Ring. After Radagast left to give Gandalf the message from Saruman, he was not found thereafter in his home again. What happens to him after the War is also unknown.

Tadaa, Raven1015 may riddile the next riddle.

something is held at bay by fire

The Arkenstone?

It was held by Smaug aka fire.

Thorin and company had almost fought with the Elves etc for it, but in the end they are friends or at least have equal enemies so it sowed discord. (even among the company itself, Bilbo, we know the story)

But it was also a sign of peace when Dain became King under the Mountain and restored Erebor. Also the Arkenstone is a sign oof peace and unity among the Dwarves.

A Watchful Peace?

 

I'm assuming "star" is a reference to the Spirit symbol.

 

I'm not sure what the "cousin" was, maybe Shadow of the Past, since it does something very similar, but it can be any type of encounter card and it's neutral.

 

Idraen (and Greyflood Wanderer; both "Dunedain") came out giving us the desire for decks that focus on locations, which A Watchful Peace helps with by recurring locations and preventing non-locations, therefore "saving" this card from the pit filled with cards known as "coasters" according to TftC.

Correct! SoW is a spirit event that has been rarely used, its "cousin" Test of Will meanwhile is an extremely popular card. Idraen however made SoW relevant again since she can exhaust to trigger the event, explore the location then ready again. Its actually a pretty nifty trick in multiplayergames where Idraen shines.

Good guess with "A watchful peace", I actually didn't think about that otherwise id have included a clue about how old SoW is (core set, for those who don't remeber).

He stopped an army with the help of a strategist and warrior.

With his love for old stories he manipulated the enemy who wasn't able to do anything.

Thanks to one of such stories and some help he was able to save the North.

He summoned many people who came to take vengeance of an innocent's death.

He promoted a skilled ranger who was able to shot more arrows.

He saved a town thanks to a banished but nice fellow.

And his praises are seen and known by many.

I don't find it complicated.

Hope or Fate?  (Like Gollum, I'm going to sneak in two guesses!)

 

Also, I would just like to say that every time I read this topic's title, the jingle from the commercials for "Guess Who" when I was growing up start running through my head.

All incorrect. Here's the clue:

Think how you can promote someone in this game.

## 235 [John Constantine on July 1, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/114945-can-you-guess-who/?do=findComment&comment=2290184)

Seastan.

## 236 [Mikallo on July 1, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/114945-can-you-guess-who/?do=findComment&comment=2290383)

When you say "promote," I think sword-thain and that leads to Denethor. I'm sure he believes he saved the entire north and manipulated Sauron. 

## 237 [JJ48 on July 1, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/114945-can-you-guess-who/?do=findComment&comment=2290475)

> When you say "promote," I think sword-thain and that leads to Denethor. I'm sure he believes he saved the entire north and manipulated Sauron. 

 

I'm thinking Sword-thain, as well, but I can't come up with someone who fits this description, making me think it's something more abstract.

 

Honor?  Humility?  Service?

 

...Oaths?

 

Edit:  OH!  The player!

Both Merry and Pippin served as esquires to their respective lords, but sword-thain is only associated with Merry.  It appears two places.  In The Passing of the Grey Company, Theoden says "You shall be my esquire, if you will.  Is there gear of ware in this place, Eomer, that my sword-thain could use?"

 

Merry produces his own sword and says "May I lay the sword of Meriadoc of the Shire on your lap, Theoden King?  Receive my service, if you will!"

 

Theoden replies, "Gladly will I take it.  Rise now, Meriodoc, esquire of Rohan of the household of Meduseld!  Take your sword and bear it unto good fortune."

 

Later in The Muster of Rohan, when Theoden is about to leave Merry behind, Merry asks "But why, lord, did you receive me as swordthain, if not to stay by your side?"  I have no explanation why it is used without a hyphen here, but not earlier.

 

Pippin is sworn to Denethor (in Minas Tirith) in a rather longer ceremony.  Pippin repeats after Denethor his oath, "Here do I swear fealty and service to Gondor, and to the Lord and Steward of the realm, to speak and to be silent, to do and to let be, to come and to go, in need or plenty, in peace or war, in living or dying, from this hour henceforth, until my lord release me, or death take me, or the world end.  So say I, Peregrin son of Paladin of the Shire of the Halflings."

 

Denethor responds with "And this do I hear, Denethor son of Ecthelion, Lord of Gondor, Steward of the High King, and I will not forget it, nor fail to reward that which is given: fealty with love, valour with honour, oath-breaking with vengence."

> Seastan.

Correct! Each line is a deck from him(Seastan's Boromir, Háma's Thicket, Love of Tales Combo, Very Good Reinforcements(save the North because of BoCD), Breaking Across the Ettenmoors-Infinite Resources, Anborn, the hero we need, Dori?). The final sentence is obvious.

Seastan is one of the most skilled deck-builders here and finds many many combos that can (sometimes are game breaking)

Path of Need is also applicable.

Thought so too, but rarely fight didn't make sense to me as all your characters should be available for fighting during path of need.

## 257 [John Constantine on July 2, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/114945-can-you-guess-who/?do=findComment&comment=2292335)

Not much, as path of need is not a person.
