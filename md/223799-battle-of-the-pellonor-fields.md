Man, this looks awesome! Love the way that they tie in the scenarios beyond just boons and burdens with the Corsairs and the Harad.

If that wasn’t enough, the scenario gets even bigger in Campaign Mode, tying in the results of several other scenarios! First of all, when your group sets up The Battle of the Pelennor Fields in Campaign Mode, the first player is required to set Aragorn [https://images-cdn.fantasyflightgames.com/filer_public/f8/f8/f8f85b05-dbd3-4349-a711-13e7f6452cb3/mec54-aragorn.png] (The Flame of the West, 1) aside, out of play. That’s because in the story, the siege of Minas Tirith begins while the Heir of Isildur is on his way to Pelargir. So instead of taking control of Aragorn at the beginning of the scenario, the first player adds The Corsair Fleet [https://images-cdn.fantasyflightgames.com/filer_public/33/3c/333c56a0-b077-48b8-ad69-ce3a8423ccd1/mec54-the-corsair-fleet-1.png] objective (The Flame of the West, ##) to the staging area and places a number of resource tokens on it. This number is determined by how many rounds it took the players to defeat the Corsairs in the previous scenario: The Siege of Gondor.

mec54-the-corsair-fleet-1.png [https://images-cdn.fantasyflightgames.com/filer_public/33/3c/333c56a0-b077-48b8-ad69-ce3a8423ccd1/mec54-the-corsair-fleet-1.png] [https://images-cdn.fantasyflightgames.com/filer_public/7e/58/7e5826a6-7b23-4126-9d91-1365bc143ed7/mec54-the-corsair-fleet-2.png]In that scenario, Aragorn leads The Grey Company to Pelargir where they battle the Corsairs of Umbar. At the end of that battle, Aragorn and his companions capture the Black Fleet and use the Corsair ships to sail up Anduin to Minas Tirith. Then, when you play The Battle of the Pelennor Fields in Campaign Mode, you, your friends, and all the heroes at Minas Tirith must endure the waves of Mordor's armies as they wait for Aragorn to travel up the river in his captured ships. And when the last resource token is finally removed from The Corsair Fleet, you can once again take control of Aragorn.

Just as in the books, the arrival of Isildur’s Heir can turn the tide of the battle. But that’s not the only thing that can tip the scales: The Witch-king also held forces in reserve. When the players advance to stage 5A in campaign mode, the campaign card instructs the players to add each Harad enemy recorded in the campaign log to the staging area. These are the same Harad enemies that the players were unable to defeat in Journey to the Cross-roads from The Land of Shadow. Because they were able to advance to The Black Gate (The Land of Shadow, ##) in that scenario, they can return now to attack you and your heroes at stage 5 of The Battle of the

Note the new boons to make one hero Rohan and another one Gondor, as mentioned on one of the quest cards. I guess that means we're not getting Merry and Pippin cards with the traits baked in. That's okay by me, I kinda figured as much.

And its flip side:

mec54-the-witch-king-sorcerer.png [https://images-cdn.fantasyflightgames.com/filer_public/27/98/27983067-6165-4717-828f-daa93d32703e/mec54-the-witch-king-sorcerer.png]

 

I had high expectations for this quest, since it involves so many different elements coming together. I love the narrative flow through the different quest stages, as the pressure and the stakes get higher (but there are also moments of hope when Rohan and Aragorn arrive).

 

I had thought that the quest might involve players on separate stages (if there were multiple players) to represent the Rohirrim getting closer to Gondor and finally arriving. That wouldn't work well for solo, though. My theme OCD is slightly disappointed because it feels like Rohan heroes shouldn't be present at the start of the game, but I'll get over it. The Rohan player's contributions will represent the fact that Witch-King diverted an army to try to stop Rohan from reaching Minas Tirith.

 

I wonder how significant Aragorn's arrival will be. He has good stats (and potentially Sword that was Broken), but I wonder whether there will be any encounter cards that are less bad if Aragorn's in play (or perhaps the fellowship player card in the box will really help for this quest, but Aragorn needs to be in play to use it).

 

Way to go, Caleb! This looks richly thematic and epic, and I am definitely looking forward to it.

> The charge of the Rohirrim is... one ally?

 

It is also damage on enemies in the staging area by the difference Willpower - Threat for one questing. And there you have it - if Aragorn arrives with the Rohirrim and you slap him with the Sword that was broken, the charge may wipe the board clean. I say it is a pretty **** good representation of enemies being overrun by cavalry.

 

Keep in mind that the Campaign card is not shown and it might have additional bonuses for Aragorn and/or Rohan, like bonus stats for the player controlling him, +1 Willpower for all Rohan characters once you reach Stage 4 etc. This scenario's design is godlike.

The design of the city and siege towers in "The White City Besieged" look awfully similar to their depictions in the movies.  I'm not sure how I feel about that.

 

Also, I have to disagree with the statement:

"When The Flame of the West Saga Expansion makes its way to retailers, you will have the opportunity to play a personal role in what is possibly the most exciting battle in fantasy fiction: The Battle of the Pelennor Fields."

 

I'm sorry, but I don't think we'll be getting to the "most exciting battle" until next saga expansion, when we (hopefully) get the Scouring of the Shire!

(Though, I suppose the massive clash of all the free peoples of Middle Earth against the thralls of Morder with the Witch-king himself at their head would probably rate a close second.)

Mutual Accord + Gondorian Fire, then. And maybe a Parting Gifts thrown in, since if you're playing Mutual Accord, you have a Leadership hero.

I thought they might do a Helm's Deep 2.0 for this quest and I would have been happy with that as it is an awesome quest. But seeing what is actually coming is incredible. Playing quests that give you a turn to set up before you have to do anything always feels like the encounter deck taunting you: "Go ahead, I will crush you anyway" and you know you are in for some trouble if you want to get a nice result.

Everything feels so thematic, too! You feel the doom that is gathering just from the quest Cards and you know you will be relieved when Aragorn and Rohan arrive and you have to battle it out with the witch king.

 

The art is great, stage 3 and 5 surely look similiar to the movies, but I can't see the downside of this. If I was to order an Oliphant attack against thousands of Rohirim I would you the same Formation. This is an organised army after all, you don't Need mumakils running left and right without order, you just want to hit as much enemies as possible with These Monsters and the line is perfect for that.

I don't think it is wise to choose art for this game with the first rule being: Don't let it look like the movies. Just take the best :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] If it Looks PJ-like so be it.

You could also just give her Elf-Friend and use Tale of Tinuviel to ready her with your fellowship Aragorn. That would give her another +4 attack with Herugrim, and you could attack with her twice in the round. Only the second attack could use Herugrim to the fullest though.

Has it been confirmed the other hero is a Gondorian? If so, with Imrahil and Denethor seeing release this cycle (though that is not super-indicative) it might have to be Beregond. Still think we shall see Éomer and Imrahil allies, and Denethor objective-ally perhaps...

From the quest cards, it's definitely not the most excited or epic battle at all, may the encounter cards could give me more suprise.

 

The massing of Osgiliath can be an epic battle, there's only 4 stages, but it gives tight beginning, continuous enemies, unable to explore the locations of the other side of the river but the threats keep in count, sacrifice hero to cross the river, the final battle against the witch king, etc.

 

The battle of the Lake Town, Ruins of Belegost, The Helm's Deep could also mean epic.

If it's Gondor, then I'd agree that Beregond could make an appearance. But I think that Eomer plays a larger role in the battle, and it'd be nice to see a Spirit/Leadership version of him that symbolizes him after Theoden dies.

I don't think we will get 2 Rohan heroes in a Gondor-Rohan saga expansion. Seeing we got that art most likely depicting Beregond, I strongly incline to think we'll see him as the second hero of the box, either Spirit or Leadership. Leadership Éomer, though, is still an almost obvious candidate for a hero in a future product. Rohan seems to be veering towards Leadership, and considering that Elfhelm isn't really a Rohan hero as much as a Mount hero, a possible new Éomer would gladly fill the role now occupied by Théodred.

## 31 [Fingolfin Fate on July 7, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/223799-battle-of-the-pellonor-fields/?do=findComment&comment=2299018)

I agree with the two above that contradict each other. Eomer certainly plays a much larger role in the part of the book in question than Beregond does, but on the other hand it would be strange to get two Rohan and no Gondor heroes, when the story takes place in Gondor. Actually the two largest characters for the Battle are probably Theoden and Denethor (well, not counting Aragorn and Gandalf) but we shan't get them for obvious reasons.

Where was the art for the new Beregond? If he indeed is the one, it will be amusing to get him together with Eowyn: a Spirit defender (provided his stats remain) and a Tactics quester. Oh perhaps he could even get a one-time action with a big willpower boost.

And we do need Eomer in saga, I think there is no doubt he appears. If he is not the hero in Flame, he will either be an ally or more likely a hero in the last saga. And Leadership seems given, since he becomes king.

That you have a free round only hints what Horrors are about to come in my opinion.

I am pretty sure that there will be a continuous stream of enemies, too. During stage 3 it is impossible to travel to pelennor Locations (if I remeber correctly you could clear Locations in the staging are in massing, too). There will be a final battle against the witch king :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png].

 

Massing at osgiliath = battle of the pelennor, confirmed :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

And yeah as you said the Encounter Cards are going to do a lot in deciding how the battle will go^^ I am expecting tons of orcs, trolls, maybe siege weapons, annoying Locations (most likely threat boosting) and horrible treacheries (more enemies, direct damage, maybe even discards from Play and ofc direct damage to minas tirith).

I think it's going to be at Gen Con as an early release.

Here's the thread where I posted the art. If you read the books and they made any sort of impact on you, I think it's almost certain it depicts Beregond after abandoning his post, killing the guards and rescuing Faramir.

I'd disagree with the idea that Eomer plays a larger role than Beregond in the book. He has some kind of significant moments in the battle, but equally that's where Beregond has his big moment of saving Faramir, plus the book up to that point is mostly following Pippin, and Pippin is spending most of his spare time hanging out with Beregond and/or Bergil.

I agree with this as well. Beregond and Bergil are kind of underrated characters. For me they were some of the most enjoyable elements of the first half of the ROTK, and they both had a pretty important role both in the story and in the themes of the books.

Beregond, leadership or spirit?

I see Beregond being more Spirit than Leadership. Makes a good duo with a 4 quester in Tactics. Leadership would be interesting, but honestly all of our recent Leadership heroes have been so defensive I am getting a bit tired. Erkenbrand, Amarthiúl, Denethor, even Elfhelm if yu give him a mount will be used mostly for defense... and Halbarad and Faramir don't really help the situation. That is, unless Leadership Beregond has an ability that switches his willpower with his defense or something like that. Otherwise, I prefer Spirit Beregond. In fact him and an ally version of Bergil could redefine the Spirit part of the Gondor trait which is rather underdeveloped.

Oh, I thought it'd be kinda obvious I read the books with the nick I sport here. I do not think many casual fans know Fingolfin, there many LotR fans who might not know him even...

And thanks for the link.

Ok, I too see the importance of minor characters -- both on the outcome of things as is Tolkien's favourite and on the reader. However, in this case, it is hardly a competition because both Éomer and Beregond have some very emotional moments but Éomer is followed much more intensely (his emotions too). And of course he plays a much larger role in the scheme of things, leading the Rohirrim after the death of Théoden.

I really may be reading a different edition of the book. It is not that I do not appreciate Beregond, he is a great character, but saying he has a larger role than Éomer, well, that is to me like saying Fatty has a larger role than Merry.

I hope Beregond is Spirit, for a while I wanted Leadership Gondorian heroes, now I feel we have enough. Not enough Spirit though, even though it has not been a Gondor sphere so far.

I have no idea what Spirit is supposed to represent any more.

Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand...yes, it's Speregond. Sorry for the ones that crossed fingers for Éomer(or Halbarad in my case).
