Hey there, I just got my copy of the game and I wondered how to play with more than 2 players. I cant find any answers in the rules except that its possible with 2 coresets.

Do I need a second copy just for additional thread counters?

Pretty much.  You can just use dice or a pad of paper to track your threat.  Every card you need for a 3-4 player game is in the box.

Thx. Im not sure but is it posible that the encounter-deck is too small for a 4player game? Any experience?

Don't think there has been any issues reported on this.

Don't forget that you shuffle the encounter deck if it is empty during the Quest phase (page 14).

Ok, so I dont mix two encounter-sets when having purchased two core sets, as they propose?

 No. The encounter decks for each quest is set. There is a listing for the different sets of cards used to construct the decks in the support section for the game.

 I've played several 3-4 player games with one core set.  I haven't run into any major problems.

Thx alot. Its the same for the adventure-packs I guess?

The deck for an adventure is set. But is the number of cards in these decks set, too? Where can I find the list of cards with numbers for each quest?

 No problem, I like answering people´s rules questions. It helps me learn the rules better too.

 You also can't make more than two "tournament size" decks with just what's in the core set, but a few expansions will also help take care of that.
