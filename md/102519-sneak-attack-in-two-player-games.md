Hey, I was just wondering: can sneak attack be used to put an ally into play under your partners control? The exact text of Sneak Attack reads: "Put 1 ally card into play from your hand. At the end of the phase, if that ally is still in play, return it to your hand." It doesn't specify "under your control," so does that mean it's wide open as to where you can play it?

Here is a link [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/61280-sneak-attack-and-gandalf/?hl=%2Bsneak+%2Battack] to topic posted about this question a couple years ago.

 

When a player plays an ally card, it comes into play under his/her control and is placed in his/her play area. Ally cards cannot be played under the control of another player, they can only change control through card effects. This means you have to have an ally already in play before you can change his control through card effects, such as Wandering Took's [http://hallofbeorn.com/HallOfBeorn_deploy/Cards/Search?Query=wandering%20took&CardType=None&CardSet=Any&Trait=Any&Keyword=Any&Cost=-1&Sphere=None&Unique=False&Sort=None&Random=False] ability.

That figures. Thanks.
