Playing last night, our heroes defeated Ungoliant's spawn before we got to the 3rd part of the quest. When we reached it, we each pulled out a spider from the encounter deck AND Ungoliant's spawn from the discard pile. Did we do this correctly?

I assume that you two took the "Don't Leave the Path" quest as the final quest (you know you can choose between 2 branches).

In fact, you are revealing one more spider than the quest card tells you.

So putting in play Ungoliant (to reach the final goal faster and kill it) and 1 lesser spider (that's a total of 2) is OK. There's no problem if Ungoliant was in the discard pile (the quest tells to look into your encounter deck and discard pile).

Actually, you can't choose between the two branches.  The quest card actually states that you proceed to the next card "at random."  As for the number of spiders to draw, that depends on the number of players in the game.  It's one spider per player.  If you were playing a two player game, then you would have drawn two spider cards, and yes, you can draw from the discard pile since the quest card states as much.  I'm not sure how many players were playing the game in question since that wasn't specified in the first post.  Furthermore, since the objective of "Don't Leave the Path" is to kill Ungoliant's Spawn, you most certainly would add that card to the staging area even if the card was in the discard pile already.

I'm sorry.  I misunderstood the first post.  They did draw too many spiders.  *lol*

It's draw one spider per player, AND one of which should definitely be Ungoliant's Spawn if you are trying to complete the quest.
