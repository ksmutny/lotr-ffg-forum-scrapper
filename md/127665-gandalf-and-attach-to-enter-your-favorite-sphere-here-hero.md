Well.. I think the title of the topic is clear enough... When playing attachments which can be attached only on heroes belonging to a specific sphere, (such as "a burning brand", or "Support of the eagles") I guess they can be played on Gandalf as they are played from the top of library. I am right ? Because while, playing them, Gandalf has de matching sphere.

Â 

The second issue is. When Gandalf loses the sphere... the attachment stays, or it is discarded ?

i think Gandalf can attach Burning Brand when he uses his ability. And it is forever. IMO
