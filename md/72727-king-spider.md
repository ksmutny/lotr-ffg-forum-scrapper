King Spider, when revealed 'Each player must choose and exhaust  one character he controls'.

What if a player has no 'ready' characters as they are all already exhausted? Ignore the 'when revealed'  requirement?

Just making sure I'm playing the game correctlyangel.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/angel.gif] 

Thanks for your help.

 I think so, just discard that card.

 I believe that if you have all your characters exhausted then you have no other choice than ignore the effect

 

But the card remains on play.

 Thanks for the confirmation, just have to take the hit when he attacks as no defenders ready :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

Yeah, I would think having Enemies attack undefended would be a much bigger problem than not having someone to exhaust. KS attacks for 3 before shadow card, not getting to use defense and having to take all that dmg on a single hero, you'll quickly see numbers dip.
