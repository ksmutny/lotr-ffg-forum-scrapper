 This would fit good with her story.

And now that we have got Glorfindel as a good fighter for spirit, she would be the missing willpower hero for tactics.

Stats would of course be the same and her ability could be:

Response: When declaring Eowyn as an attacker against an enemy with a threat threshold of 40 or more she gets +5 attack.

Well, this would be good but Glorfindel already showed us that stats aren't written on stone.
I doubt many people (if any) predicted he would not have 12 Threat Cost.

 

Maybe she'll keep her Will (I'm praying for it), but she doesn't need to keep her low ATK.

Yes, being totally convince the stats are the same I overlooked them to read the ability and thought "is this a joke?" Only then I saw the threat cost…

 I think your logic for a Tactics Éowyn is excellent. Very good thoughts.

 If people have been predicting Taeowyn for a year now, we all need to predict harder, because that is a card I want very badly. Gimli and Legolas, in fact, demand that this card be made.

Taeowyn! Yes, great idea, and I also hope we see such a card!

yeah all these better version are fine…..but in my opinion its time for 2 things to happen now

1. new tolkien characters for heros

2. please ffg- pay someone apart from magali to do hero art- im a big fan…..but i was also a big fan of baracchi, nash and others…..like a good marriage….variation has to come in at some point gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]

Yeah, I also am a huge fan of the Baracchi heroes as well like Beravor/Boromir/Dain, and a few others artists like David A. Nash's Prince Imrahil, Tony Foti's Gimli/Dwalin/Loragorn, Tom Garden's Gloin, Jeff Himmelman's Theodred, etc, etc, etc. Actually I'm gonna stop now before I name like every hero, lol. There's not really many cards that I don't love the artwork for. Magali's cards are just ridiculously great as well.

The majority of art for this game has just been top notch. They could spread the love around more, though I can't really complain when everything looks so **** good.

I really want to see a Tactics Sam… I think this will come in the hobbit decks or maybe as the last Hero in Darodelf.

We have Lore and Spirit Hobbits and while we are missing a leadership hobbit, (who i would have probably done as frodo) I think a tactics hobbit is the real missing part to make a full hobbit hero deck. Sam becomes a full warrior by the end of the stories and basicly storms a evil castle by himself at once stage.. so him being tactics fits really well in the story as well..

the other two main hobbits also have reasons to be tactics

pippin became a warrior of the tower guard

merry, though forbidden to ride to war by theoden, still did and helped bring down the witch king

and as youve rightly said sam also has claims to it……so im not so sure….sam also shows some mighty leadership when frodo starts to 'thin' and he also shows alot of willpower, so i think anything but lore

Strangely I see Pippin as a leadership hero. Soley based on when he was hanging out with the Gondor people. As for Merry, yeah I can see him go tactics. As for Sam, sadly I'd rather see him as a Neutral ally because he could fit into any sphere except for Leadership. Well maybe he could. As much as I would love to see these 3 in the near future it would be cool if we got some new original Hobbits.

In regards to the OP, I completely agree that Eowyn should have a Tactics copy. With a 1/3/2/3 stats.

 If I had done the 4 main hobbits from the trilogy, I'd have done a Lore Frodo, Spirit Sam, Leadership Merry, and Tactics Pippin. But having Bilbo early on sort of forced Frodo to be in a different sphere, and Lore really fit Bilbo well.

I also think a Spirit Merry and Leadership Pippin would be awesome so that they could synergize with Rohan and Gondor respectively.

Gondor has red cards as well though - so Pippin could be tacitcs or leadership (the 2 spheres that Gondor is in) and still fit.

Gondor is all over the place. Four heroes in four spheres. Even the Noble family: Father is Lore, Elder Son Tactics, Younger Son Leadership (together with their uncle).

We may see a similar thing with another famous family, Twin Brothers being Tactics and Leadership, younger sister Spirit, Father guess what, Lore?

thats good thinking there…….what about theoden and his family - how do they stand up (i would work this out but im too sleepy)

I like these family things. And am not too sleepy. Haha.

So, Gimli is Tactics, his father Gloin Leadership. And I feel the same will happen with Legolas Tactics and Thranduil being Leadership.

As for Rohan, Théodred is Leadership already and I think his father Théoden will be also, but his nephew and future king Éomer might as well be Tactics.

Together with Elrond (Lore) these are four major guesses and I wonder how many I am going to hit. But I also think Elrond will be an ally while the other three mentioned (and not yet released) shall all be heroes. I further think Théoden might have a sort of overlooking ability for the Rohan trait, not totally unlike Dáin; but as far as guessing the abilities I have seldom been right.

To make this post totally all over the place, and to come back to the OP, I feel we shall get another copies of some of the great characters when we hit Rohan and Gondor deluxe. Tactics Éowyn seems very thematic as does Leadership Boromir, and a hero version of Faramir was already announced (in the same interview where the second coming Glorfindel was forseen).

one of these days im going to sit down and work out just how many major characters there are before ffg start to scrape the barrel (not that any of tolkiens creations are 'bottom of the barrel' material- but you get my point)

## 23 [booored on June 14, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65851-i-am-predicting-we-will-get-a-tactics-eowyn-some-day/?do=findComment&comment=644756)

It is my strong hope that they do more of their own made up stuff. While the Tolkien theme needs to be respected and paid homage to.. . I think they should have the freedom to stray around it.

Like for example.. there are no Cyclops in Tolkiens stories.. but there is no reason why these can not fit into the fantasy world.. maybe he just nvr talked about it. Same with other creatures like griffins or w/e. Do we really want "Troll Number 15" or would we like tro see a new cool monster like says Cyclops or a cat person.

The game is only young and it is already repeating its self. How many times can they make packs with Orcs and trolls in it b4 we are all booored to death of it?

It is something they have to be careful with as you need to respect the theme.. but I see no problem with imagining stuff.. I mean Beravor for example is a fine example of a made up character that fit fine.

Like we are already at 3 heroes and counter that are doubled up, and one player card is in the encounter decks as well so you can not use her in those quests. Now I see people talking as if this is a good thing.. but it isn't.. every time they make a new Hero that has the same name as an old one they are not ADDING to the game they are REPLACING as you can not use the new hero and the old hero at the same time. This is restricting deck building and basically making it so we buy a new pack but our card pool is not increasing.

Each hero should be unique.

what about Ghân-buri-Ghân? Have man half Neanderthal stupid as a brick fat as world of warcraft player and representative of English imperialism over the developing nations at the time. It is like Tolkiens "golliwog" character.. it is just insulting… "Oh those primitive people out there in the colonies.. they have such quaint nobility what?".. lol @ the English.

i dont really have a problem with ffg making up good heros- i mean theyre just middle earth inhabitants with names right?

using my head with help from a very good source on the internet (encylopedia of arda) i can list races as the following

-ainur - eg maiar and valar (including maiar related spirits such as balrogs)

-elves

-dwarves

-men

-hobbits

-orcs

-ents huorns and old man willow

-dragons

-trolls

-giants

-woses/druedain

-wights undead etc

-wolves and wargs and werewolves

-eagles and other birds

-skin changer such as beorn

-vampires

-whatever the hell bombadil and goldberry are

-watcher in the water

-obviously all other creatures found on earth such as insects, rabbits, dogs, birds, fish and so on

so thats plenty to go on- i really dont think we shall se any other 'fantasy' type creatures not seen in middle earth texts, such as cyclops, hydras, zombies and other warhammer-esqe creatures

Nice list. You could also add:

- the giant spiders, including Shelob (descendants of Ungoliant - who herself appears to have been in a category of her own as unspecified "evil spirit")

- the fell winged beasts the Nazgul ride. I think these are stated to have been bred by Sauron from existing originals (pterodactyl-like creatures, I always picture them as)

- the nameless things that gnaw the world "far, far below the deepest delving of the Dwarves…Even Sauron knows them not. They are older than he" that Gandalf speaks of when he returns from death. In fact we are going to meet these fellows in FOS. I think the watcher in the water is speculated to be one of these that has crawled out into the lake outside the west gate.

I'm not completely convinced by the giants - they certainly feature in the account of the journey over the Misty Mountains in the Hobbit, but you could read this as being a narrative embellishment to personify the stormy weather, rather than actually existing giant humanoid creatures. I'm pretty sure there is no other report of such creatures in any other writing on Middle-earth. It looks like they are going to feature in the forthcoming Hobbit box anyway.

Personally I wouldn't want to see anything from outside this list feature in the game, and I don't think it will - I have been in the main consistently impressed by the FFG design team's understanding of and faithful sensitivity to Tolkien's world.

Plus there's such a high variety of most of these…

yeah for instance within men you can spread it out to

men of dale

men of gondor / ithillien

men of rohan

men of breeland

dunedain

men umbar/harad/rhun

men in forochel

woodsmen near borders of mirkwood

perhaps even the slaves of Nurn

 

all the different types of elves- mirkwood, lorien, grey havens, rivendell

 

dwarves of the iron hills

dwarves of the blue mountains

and within each of these you can have different tpyes again so

spearmen

swordsmen

axemen

archers

spearmen

healers

standard bearers/ musicians/bards

captains/leaders/guards of important people ie city guard

scouts

horsemen

and this is just to name a few - you have of course different orcs- misty mountains/isengard/mordor etc and trolls the same

so i do not think ffg will run out soon…if ever in the course of the game….

 yeah, because the MAIN REASON why I play this game is the relative adherence to Tolkien's stories and characters… if they start putting in "generic" fantasy features, this will ruin the game!

 

I already don't like the fact that in the future probably, you are going to be able to make a hobbit deck and wander around moria, meet the balrog, say hi, run away, go to osgiliath… WHAT THE ***** the hobbits NEVER would have wandered on their own in middle-earth! that's plain ridiculous! all other characters I could accept, though through our playing the quests and Tolkien's book, Aragorn and Boromir etc. have met the balrog twice (!?!?) and have already been to Moria… but roaming around with three hobbits… think about it: they wouldn't even have the willpower or stamina or strength 17 years ago - just look at frodo, other than his ability… or bilbo. making pippin and sam and merry… it could work but THAT already is a very far-fetched theme in Tolkien's world…

im a lore freak as many know, and i agree ffg need to draw boundaries and stick to them, otherwise we may as well call this 'world of warcraft' or some such middle earth copy…..however i also think being able to play about with characters and situations is a big plus point to this- the customization is what draws many people….i think they have the balance right at the moment so hope they stick with what theyre doing

No, the giants are real. Thorin mentions them also. And Gandalf later says he'll need to find a decent giant… So these are no Balrog's wings actually.

As for the variety: yes, no way they'll ever need bringing more stuff. Name the characters? Surely, no way around it pretty much, just try your best and look for hints in Tolkien's dictionary (as I believe they have, do and will). Create new races, creatures, things? No!

Just look at some military oriented games, Elven factions have a number of army ranks as Rich said, archers, scouts, rangers, sentry, swordsmen, militia, riders, lancers, horse archers, special units - and that is only within military and Elves! And the game hasn't even begun to employ any of the traits they have created, there's no card for the already existing traits like Warrior, Ranger, Archer, Minstrel, Crafstman, Scout, Healer, let alone Noble or Steward (found on Denethor - I am much interested if that one ever sees some importance).

We have Lore and Spirit Hobbits and while we are missing a leadership hobbit, (who i would have probably done as frodo) I think a tactics hobbit is the real missing part to make a full hobbit hero deck. Sam becomes a full warrior by the end of the stories and basicly storms a evil castle by himself at once stage.. so him being tactics fits really well in the story as well..



Thematically I think that either Pippin or Merry could make sense as Leadership hobbits at some point. I am thinking of the later parts of TLOTR, once they have had the experience of serving Denethor/Theoden and of fighting in the big battles - when they return to the Shire, they are both perceived as lordly/princely figures, and it is them (not Frodo who stays in the background) who organise the successful resistance to Saruman's forces in the scouring of the shire.

i believe that we may see again 2 versions of merry and pippin - pre Return of the King and post RTK, as i think they are two of the most changed characters in the year (and a day?) that it took to go to mordor and back

 yes, THAT I can live with… so you're assuming that this LCG will in fact cover the "book" part of LOTR? i.e. the war of the ring? that would actually be great to play as a team in a HUGE campaign start from the shire, pass the misty mountains, lorien, the anduin, etc…. all the way to mordor :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

I could imagine wiser and older and mightier versions of the hobbits or other characters… but as this game was originally supposed to cover the 17 years "inbetween"… well… so far, so good, I can't complain! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

well from the start of the game there was much talk on the 'limitations' and that they were from the years of the end of the hobbit until around the long expected party - we now know this not to be true with the hobbit box set- so i guess its possible
