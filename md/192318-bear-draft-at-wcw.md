With Dan recently posting updates to his draft format on Hall of Beorn, I'm really excited about trying it out. I would like to host something at the FGG World Championships next week.

 

Thursday night (11/05) is the ideal night for me. I'm playing in the Star Wars Swiss rounds and should be ready to go with the draft by 7:00pm. Dan said the card draft itself can take 30 to 45 minutes plus the length of the quest.

 

Anyone interested in joining in on the fun?

I wish that Landroval could just drop me off in Minnesota! Drafting this game is so much fun.

I could possibly be interested, but I will be there for the IA tournament on Saturday, so I fly in late Friday.  I could possible be interested in doing it Saturday evening after IA swiss is over, or Friday (but it would probably have to be late-ish...I probably won't make it to the event center until 8pm or so Friday depending on traffic and all.
