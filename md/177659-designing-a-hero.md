I'm more curious about what you would make a faramir hero look like but also if you were designing a hero for merry and pippin on more of their rohan/gondor side and eowyn on her warrior side. any others you might feel like doing. those are the main ones im thinking of though

well, there is a faramir hero out, so I assume you mean a new one.   Which is a pretty good idea, the lore faramir doesn't get a whole lot of love.  I guess I might do something like:

Faramir (Spirit)  11
2W
2A

2D

5HP

Gondor, Ranger, Noble
Ranged.  
Faramir gains +1A for each other Ranger hero you control.

 


Eowyn (T) 9
4W
1A
1D
3HP

Noble, Rohan, Warrior
Planning Action:  Switch Eowyn's A and W values for the remainder of this turn.


Just some ideas.

Ive always felt that the Ranger/Trap decks needed an ability that allowed for a ranger to make an attack against an enemy immediately after a trap became attached to it. You could do this with an attachment or event, but I'd love to see it on a hero and a Faramir remake wouldnt be a terrible card to put it on.

I have already made this exact suggestion somewhere here on the forum, but this is how I see Faramir:

 

he should be Leadership and work with Rangers as their captain:

 

Faramir

(11) 2 2 2 5

Gondor. Noble. Ranger.

Ranged

 

Any Ranger ally that attacks with Faramir in one attack gains +1 attack and Ranged.

 

Action: Exhaust Faramir to put 1 Ranger ally from your hand to play for free (Limit once per game).

 

 

AND 

 

There should be another Ranger Hero working with traps.

> Any Ranger ally that attacks with Faramir in one attack gains +1 attack and Ranged.

You can't do that. Well, you can, but it won't serve the purpose. To declare an attack against an enemy engaged with another player, a character must already have Ranged. Without Ranged, you simply won't be able to declare them as attackers to reap the benefit.

I know I would not work with this wording, but you get my idea. That Ranger allies attacking together with Faramir could attack enemies engaged with another player. I just don't know hoe to put it in proper wording.

Response: After you declare Faramir as an attacker, exhaust any number of Ranger characters to declare them as attackers against the same enemy. They get +1 Attack for this attack.

In AoO you get both Faramir and Forest Patrol, which does this. I agree the Ranger/Trap archetype could use something more like it, though.

Faramir

 

2/3/2/5

 

Gondor. Noble. Ranger.

 

Ranged.

 

Response: After Faramir attacks and destroys an enemy, return a Trap attached to that enemy to its owner's hand.

are we likely to see a new faramir hero any time soon?

Maybe in the sagas. We'll eventually have Frodo and Sam encounter him in Ithilien.
