In response to Nate French's article, where do you see yourself as a player?

I feel like I'm 70 percent Bilbo, 30 percent Pippin. I care more about really sucking all the theme out of the game that I can and making sure everyone has a good time than if I win or not. I had a great game with my wife the other day where we lost in Dol Guldur but we ended it with a (literal and thematic) roar as she turned Beorn into a bear to deal the Nazgul a deadly blow before we fell to the threat counter...

 10% Boromir. 40% Bilbo 50% Pippin.  I love trying out interesting combos that can create fun, or deeply thematic turns of events, but my competitive nature sometimes has to show itself. I created more than one viciously efficient hobbit deck back in the Decipher days.

I'm probably 60% Boromir and 40% Pippin. I like finding new combos, but I also like decks that work.

Did anyone else notice that Gandalf cost 6 in that picture?

Bilbo 100%.Who cares about win and broken decks wen you can live the dream of Middle-Earth.

There and back again...

I'm like 70/30 for Boromir/Bilbo. I can't stand to lose, I want the shadow to fall and I want it to fall hard. I will put the cards into my deck that will give me the best chance of victory. However, my choice for starting heroes is almost entirely story based. I love Dwarves and I love Rohan, so my first deck is built around some Dwarves and Rohan. It doesn't matter that Tac/Spirit is seen as weak, because that's what I like. Same for Beorn. I constantly think he might be too expensive, but I always include him, just because HE'S BEORN!

This is going to sound weird, but I'm not smart enough to be Pippin. I have to have people tell me card combos and will almost never be able to find them on my own. I do try to study the cards (that's also the Bilbo in me) but as much as I enjoy them, nothing pops out at me.

Bilbo > Pippin  > Boromir

I play because of the Bilbo aspect, currently mostly Tolkien-flavoured games only. Then when I start playing I look for a theme - like putting Beorn in no matter what because I so much like the character. But then I do not construct whole decks around a single theme. And the Boromir aspect begins to prevail when I buy new core sets only to have the best cards 3 times each.

1/3 each way. Unfortunately I suck at being Boromir and Pippin.

 40 % Boromir, 35 % Bilbo, 25 % Pippin

40% Boromir, and the rest some combination of pippin and bilbo, can't tell çause the cardpool isn't large enough

I thought about that when I was reading the article. High percentage Pippin players must be pretty frustrated right now because the hero deck card pools are quite small. 15 cards per sphere doesn't give them much to work with. Be strong, Pippins! Hunt for Gollum can't possibly be too far away!

70% Boromir, 30% Pippin.

LOL I am ok with the card pool for now. Sure it feels a bit incomplete, but I am not playing the game every night. New cards just mean new permutations..and the small number of cards and small number of player cards released each month really feeds my Bilbo side for story...which in turn feeds my Pippin side of wanting to come up with every ridiculous combo ever.

I'm pretty heavy on both Bilbo and Pippin. If I play in tournaments I want to play with a deck that I've put together, not picked up from someone else. So that's the Pippin in me. I'm also the guy that made sure the quest cards were read at each stage of the quest, right in the middle of the game (and not sooner than the first game!) to feel like I was questing.

One of my friends is also a Pippin sort of player. We have fun playing together. We really need a Boromir to keep us in line sometimes, I feel, but hey, it's fun!

 Oh, if held to the coals about it, I'd probably say I'm 50% Boromir, 30% Bilbo, 20% Pippin. If you enjoy winning at all, you've got a little Man of the West inside of you.

Most of what I know about Middle Earth I know from playing the old MECCG by Iron Crown, so I was pretty enthused about this version. I can't say Decipher's game impressed me at all, as it failed to appeal to my inner Bilbo entirely. Movie stills? Really?

Hmm. 50% Pippin, 30% Bilbo, 20% Boromir.

I think

As people have said, it's hard to tell at this stage, with so little deck-building being done. In the other LCGs, I really like finding fun card combination, and things that can play off each other. Obviously, it's nice if it works, but not nice enough to make it worth putting in something that would never happen in the story (example for any AGoT players, you'd never have seen me running a Martell-Wildling Deck)

But realistically, I think it's going to take at least a full cycle of chapter packs to be sure of an LoTR specific build-style.
