Did someone see my "dwarrowdelf intel" subject anywhere... I can't find it anymore...

Search reveals...nothing. That's odd. Perhaps it contained some sensitive info that FFG did not want to disclose at this moment . You'll need to be more subtle and give it some title that will escape their notice. I personally look forward to reading some "Shmarrowshmelf Shmintel." ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

I checked my post listings in my profile and my contribution to the intel thread isnt listed. Seems that the entire thread has been moved to Mordor...

First Rule: There is no Dwarrowdelf Fight Club!

Second Rule: There is no Dwarrowdelf Fight Club!

Third Rule: There is no Dwarrowdelf Fight Club!

heres a question, why does the french site always have inside info?

## 7 [zeb on November 30, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56968-dwarrowdelf-intel-its-odd/?do=findComment&comment=562128)

And what is strange is why censor something which is already on the Internet?

+ that would mean that a admin/moderator look up the threads and DIDN'T STICK THE FAQ THREAD !!!

Well, doquestion is now, do I repost the whole thing ?

 You could post it on BGG and they couldn't take it down.  I'd like to see it in any event.

Can you post a link? Google translate may be fine for non-French readers.

 TBH, I think the most likely explanation is that intel was wrong for APs 4-6...as they looked a lot like the descriptions for the three Khazad quests. FFG may have decided to remove the thread to avoid this spreading?

It's a RSS link to an article that seems to have been deleted anywhere between the post time and now...

www.edgeent.com/v2_fr/edge_asp/edge_rss_upcoming.asp [http://www.edgeent.com/v2_fr/edge_asp/edge_rss_upcoming.asp?uidedg=198]

You have to subscribe to the rss to read thewhole article. Google translation is a pretty good friend here (I tried it)

Well... They seem to have modify their RSS as weel so there is only the part for the two first packs... Unfortunately, I didn't keep the whole article...

The thread has fallen into shadow.

I think you may be on to something here. When I read the thread, I thought 4-6 sounded more like the preview to the actual deluxe expansion.

Actually all of the publishers of localized versions have that inside information: How else could they release the cards at the same date world-wide?

It's up to the individual publishers how much info they include in their previews. They may not spoil any of the original (English) cards, though.

I believe (and hope) the info was wrong for packs 4-6, it would have otherwise been pretty boring (at least for me) coming back to the mines, but I can see some more underground-oriented players would enjoy that. I for myself do not mind some Moria scare but after three quests in the deep I am all up for some fresh air.

I'm pretty sure that the end of Dwarrowdelf is back into the deep.  Here's a quote from the article that introduced the Dwarrowdelf cycle.  To me, it confirms that what was posted eariler is actually correct:

"A word from the designer

The Dwarrowdelf cycle allows players to travel along the Misty Mountains as well as delve deep into Moria. While the cycle’s narrative arc stands apart from the one in the Khazad-dûm box, the two are closely knit thematically. Players want new scenarios to feel as fresh as possible, which is why Khazad-dûm has six different encounter sets for use in the Dwarrowdelf cycle (whereas the Core Set has four). This allows us to better differentiate the areas players will be exploring and is why Khazad-dûm is a required purchase for anyone who wants to play the Dwarrowdelf scenarios.

The quests in the cycle are each meant to challenge players in new ways. Your heroes must survive raging snowstorms that lower their willpower, fight a watchful and crafty creature before the Doors of Durin, and find their way among a maze of labyrinthine passages within the depths of Moria."

My educated guesses:

survive raging snowstorms that lower their willpower = AP1

fight a watchful and crafty creature before the Doors of Durin = AP3 (see the Tentacle symbol on the Doors of Durin card)

find their way among a maze of labyrinthine passages within the depths of Moria = AP4 or AP5 (I don't remember the details of these two packs from what was spoiled earlier.  I only remember that APs 4-6 all happen underground in Moria.).
