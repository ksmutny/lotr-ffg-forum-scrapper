Can someone please tell me the cost stats and ability of Gloin in LOTR digital? He is in the tutorial.

You can also get him through Fate points in the first quest.

Going from memory, but I believe he is 2 attack, 1 willpower, 11 health. Ability is spend 1 resource to remove a shadow attachment. He costs 7 fate to get in the first quest.

 

Keep in mind at 39 threat on  that quest your allies are forcibly removed so either summon him ASAP or wait till after that happens as a free action to gain an ally.

 

Shadow attachments are ones the encounter deck gives the minions to buff them, or debuff your characters. (Not sure debuffs are in the game yet, but I thought I saw a slot for them on the characters.)

 

*All numbers are pulled from my faulty memory so hopefully they are accurate.
