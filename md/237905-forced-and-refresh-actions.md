Hi,

Could the actions below be resolved in any order?:

Gandalf: Forced: At the end of the refresh phase, discard Gandalf from play. You may raise your threat by 2 to cancel this effect.

Aragorn:

Refresh Action: Reduce your threat to your starting threat level. (Limit once per game.)

I think you have to do any voluntary Actions before the end-of-phase bit starts, after which you can only do Forced/Responses.

But I don't currently have any decent reference to base this on.

You have to use Aragorn's action during an action window in the refresh phase, which is before the refresh phase ends. Then Gandalf's forced text will trigger at the end of he refresh phase.
