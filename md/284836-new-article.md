Wow Glamdring is amazing especially being able to go on any hero. Very excited for this set!

It is a cool set. We do know the cards since some time though. Thanks for the sharing.

I wish they had kept the old art for Glamdring. The new one is kinda meh...

What isn't compared to Magali's art!

I used the Strange Eons plugin by HeavyKaragh to create a replacement for Glamdring and Orcrist. I had to enlarge the original art by Magali Villeneuve somewhat and also included the flavour text from the treasure cards. The only thing I am missing is the collection icons from Wilds of Rhovanion and its cycle.

While I think Orcrist looks really great, the colours for Glamdring do not really fit: orange and green. It would look better as a leadership, tactics or neutral card.

These look great! They should just let Magali draw everything...

@Amicus Draconis [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/332539-amicus-draconis/] I actually think the orange is muted enough that it provides a pleasing contrast to the green. Nice work!
