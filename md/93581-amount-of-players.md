The game supports up to 4 players. Just...run with 4 decks. You might need some other means to keep track of threat for two of the players, but that's easy enough.

I play in a group that pretty much exclusively always has 3 or 4 members.  You simply reveal a card per player then go for it.  You'll find that some quests are quite a bit easier for 4 players, but more often than not I've found most quests to be harder.  Treachery cards in general are much more difficult with more players.

 

We use dice packs with 36 6-sided dice in them for tracking.  We have red for damage, white for resources and green for progress.  We find this much cleaner and easier to use than the actual tokens. We also use 2 10-sided dice each for threat tracking.
