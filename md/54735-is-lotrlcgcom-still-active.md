Still no Muil on http://lotrlcg.com/.... [http://lotrlcg.com/....]

Is this site still getting updated or is it abandoned... I hope not.

Good question. It could just be that whoever runs it is slow.

Luckily we've still got http://www.cardgamedb.com [http://www.cardgamedb.com] though. I prefer Card Game DB since it has the deck builder... but LotR LCG is nice for a quick lookup.

I think the site is still active but Mason240 (the guy behind lotrlcg) is just too busy at the moment for updating it. He has already entered all the info about the Emin Muil Player cards (except pics though), the quest & encounter cards are missing.

 I have a lot of classes this semester and have been very busy the last few weeks with mid term stuff.

I haven't even been able to play the AP scenarios yet lol. 

The rest of the cards and the scans will be up later today.
