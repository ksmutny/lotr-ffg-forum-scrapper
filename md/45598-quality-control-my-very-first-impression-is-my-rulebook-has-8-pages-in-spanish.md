After an agonizing couple weeks, and one very long and sucky day at work.. I finally get my beloved copy of the game. I take off the shrink wrap and grin over the premium contents.

The very first thing I do is pick up the rulebook and thumb through it..  only to discover 8 pages are in another language. Printer error. Not just a mistake in putting the books together, but a true printing error. English on one side of a page and spanish on the other.

And I'm not knocking spanish, I'm sure it's a lovely language I don't know how to read.

I know I can print out the missing pages, and I'm doing that as I type this. I also believe that if I contact FFG, they'll send me a copy all in english. But all that aside, you know my intitial reaction? I put the cover back on the box, went out and got some chinese take-out and watched some tv for a while.  sad.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sad.gif]

 

Now I'm finally taking a look at it. I hope all the cards are in a language I can read.

Apparently this is a pretty common problem. In addition I've seen people who have German rules or rulebooks with duplicate pages.

Updated rulebook is avaiable online. Check out ffg product's site.

FFG would probably send you a new rulebook if you contacted them through the proper customer service system (parts replacement).
