Quick question:

Can I just toss dunedain hunter in any deck when playing the Elrond hero?

I think yes, but Elrond states 'pay' and dunedain hunter has 0 cost.

Good question.  Not sure.  There is a good chance that the answer is no.  It has previously been ruled [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/90737-using-a-good-harvest-with-0-cost-cards/?hl=%2Bgood+%2Bharvest] that Good Harvest cannot be used for a resource match for 0-cost cards because the card specifically states you can "spend" resources from any sphere to "pay" for cards from the named sphere:

 

"A Good Harvest does not allow players to play 0 cost cards without a resource match. Since you are not using any resources to pay for the card, the ability of A Good Harvestdoes not apply and you still need a resource match.

Cheers,

Caleb"

It's the same thing as Good Harvest, so you can't use Elrond to play Dunedain Hunter.

Thanks for the replies guys.

I did not remember the ruling on a good harvest until I read your reply GS.

It's a odd bit of wording really.

One way or the other actually could be possible imo. Hence I asked.

Yet following the words exactly, this ruling is the right choice from Caleb imo.

And indeed the case is the same in my question as teamjimby stated.

I agree in that it is not possible.

So Grima + Elrond couldn't play a Vassal of the Windlord for 0 because you aren't removing any resources? How is paying 0 any different than paying 1? That is a very goofy ruling.

Guess it comes down to an intersection between logic/math/language.  The question is: do you consider "spend 0 resources" to satisfy the clause "spend resources?"  You could make arguments both ways and go all day without swaying anybody's opinion.  The designers chose their answer..

Yeah, I don't think Grima + Elrond would work there.  I agree that it's goofy, but at least it's easy enough to follow (unlike their Quick Strike vs. Hands Upon the Bow ruling regarding immune to player card effects).

this thread on board game geek covers this issue pretty well:

Also interesting that the Gandalf hero cannot be brought back by Fortune and Fate because he does not belong to a sphere!!! Turns out sacrificing him to the Balrog, killing the Balrog and then bringing Gandalf back before finishing the quest is not at all legal and not a valid way to beat Journey in the Dark without losing a hero.

Walk me through that one? Fortune and Fate never says anything about spheres.

The card they are talking about in that example is ally Gandalf and Stand and Fight, which is the card that brings back allies of any sphere.

 

Fortune or Fate just says to bring back a hero. No stipulations about the sphere.

Bah I thought that sounded strange, really should have had a look at Fortune and Fate before posting hey! 
Stand and Fight is indeed what they meant. Fortune or Fate does not mention anything about the sphere my apologies. 

Just shows how often I use Fortune or Fate! (once or twice ever in journey in the dark for saga mode)

I've been taught that playing a 0 cost card is the only time you really need a "proper" resource match (e.g, a Tactics hero or a hero with a Song of Battle to play a 0-cost Tactics card). For a while I thought it was the other way around, and included 0-cost events from other spheres because you didn't need to pay for them.
