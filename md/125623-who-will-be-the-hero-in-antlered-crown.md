I think so that Erkenbrand (Leadership).

I think you're right.  Have we had a Rohan hero in other than Spirit  or Tactics?  I don't think so.

Grima = Lore

Theodred = Leadership

I think we're certain its going to be a Leadership hero.  My guess is also Erkanbrand, which will be really cool to have in time for Treason of Saruman.

Dunno whos this Erkanbrand guy, but last hero should be really influental. Just look back - the king of dwarves, the (sorta) king of elves, and the king of Rohan.

There is some upcoming pack -- maybe it's this one? -- whose description says it will give us more cards that show the Rohirrim's ability to charge into battle.  So a Rohan hero is a good guess.

Also, the spoiler article said it was a Rohan hero :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

Whos the second Rohan person after Theoden? Or maybe, another version of Theoden?

Gamling is always a possibility, as I believe the preview article used a quote of his.

There were three basically, Théoden's son Theodred, Eomer and Erkenbrand.

It could be Grimbold, he was another captain of Rohan.

Hmmmh, leadership version of Éowyn?

In the books this is true. (although I would of course add Eowyn) From the movies Gamling has some part too. It is too bad that Helm Hammerhand is already dead in the timespan of our game.. I would have liked him, but Erkenbrand seems the coolest choice right now.

Indeed they did (http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=4852 [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=4852]) so Gamling sounds like the right guess to me. Would still like a new, useful and appropriate version of Theoden instead but I guess for this we all have to use our own Strange Eons creation. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Ld Rohan seems a little odd to me, as we already have a Rohan Ld hero (Theodred) and the only Rohan Traited cards in Ld that I'm aware of are Snowbourne Scout and Mutual Accord -which hardly even counts.

We already have a Rohan hero for all spheres (Lore - Grima, Tactics - Eomer, Theoden, Hama, Spirit - Dunhere, Eowyn, Leadership - Theodred).  Leadership is tied with Lore for 1 hero, so if we are going by the numbers, either one works.  Leadership is probably better thematically.

I think we may also get a Rohan Leadership ally, hopefully, to complement with the hero. Or maybe an attachment or event.

Or any kind of Rohan Leadershit support. I just hope it's not tied to the name of the upcoming hero.

I really don't find Ld to be weak, trololo,  but you seem to dislike it.    I don't feel it is in need of more support than any other sphere really.

My complaint wasnt about the sphere,  it's that Ld doesnt really fit in with Rohan.  I feel the same about Grima.   Cool hero,  if he was Spirit I would probably play him.   But there just arent any Rohan cards in Lore except for Gleowine.  

So sure, if the deck comes with some sort of Ld Rohan oriented attachment and a Ld Rohan ally that is just bananas,  then I might give Erkenbrand (or whoever) a go.

He just calls it leadershiT, but he doesn't dislike it. He just doesn't play it. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

Anyway, I'm really curious! I would not even mind a madeup hero, I would rather encourage FFG to make more of those heroes. Like Mirlonde and Beravor etc.

Maybe it will be some cool Dunlending/Rohan captain. I do not care about spheres really. Dunlending allies would be cool. Or maybe Quickbeam will be a hero to go along with the Fangorn ally we will be getting. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Okay, this probably will not happen, lol.

EDIT: MyNeighbourTrololo does dislike it, kinda hates it, because in solo play he is forced to use it. So he does play it in solo, because he has to. That's why he calls it ****.

That's sorta reversive. I dislike Leadershit (sorta, not in a bad way) but I do play it. 

 

The reason I both dislike it and play it because the main meta for solo play of the game is about getting as many useful stuff out as soon as possibru, which is Leadershit most about. When I play solo, I'm almost forced to include Leadershit if I want a fighting chance. 

 

What I meant about Leadershit Rohan support here is that - if they decide to give something speicific Rohan related in the last pack, the two leadershit player cards (aside from hero) would have to do something about it, and if they do - I hope they won't be tied to that hero.

I play solo and almost never use Leadership heroes, but I do put some purple cards in my decks sometimes with Songs.

Man, I'll never understand how people can restrict themselves to only playing certain spheres, traits, or whatever. I basically build a new deck every time I play and I want to explore all the cards I've bought.

 

But back to the topic: I agree with the hero being in Leadership, most likely. The question is if the hero will conform to existing themes of Rohan (High willpower, discard for benefits, attack into the staging area, etc.) or if they'll try to shore up some of Rohan's weaknesses (defense, resources, card draw...). I hope they make Rohan more well rounded instead of just giving it more of what it already has.

The hero is going to be Leadershit not "most likely", but for sure, all other spheres of the cycle already got represented by 2 heroes each.
