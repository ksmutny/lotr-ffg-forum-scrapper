Does canceling the damage with Honour Guard will also cancel the effect? With the wording on Honour Guard it reads to me that the damage is never applied, thus not allowing to have the (positive) side effect.

I am not sure how to play with this card combos, especially because there are cards which have other wordings - like spirit Elfhelm: "After your threat is raised ..., reduce your threat by 1."

In the text of a triggered effect, anything appearing before the "to" is a cost that has to be paid to get the effect.

For Erkenbrand and Derdingle, where is says "Deal 1 damage to ...", the dealing a damage is a cost for perming the action.

Honor Guard prevents the dZdamage. If you use him, you don't end up dealing the damage so you haven't paid the cost. So, using him to prevent the damage cost of those effects also prevents those effects.

You are both right. If you cancel the cost it also cancel the effect.

I'm pretty sure you can't actually use him to prevent paying the cost but don't see it mentioned in the FAQ.  Perhaps it was answered in the e-mail/forums at some point.

I believe you can use him to prevent the cost, although I don't know why you would want to do that.  I know you can use Song of Mocking with Treebeard just to put damage on one of your heroes (like Gimli or Gloin).  Treebeard doesn't get the boost though since the cost isn't paid.

Are you sure?  I thought I remembered a post on here saying you can't cancel costs - I may be confusing games to, or I'm confusing it with the Quick Ears + Wingfoot combo.

It is something I have read several times. So I'm almost sure that you can cancel the cost. But since there is not enough consistent rules (but ruling more or less official that we can read at some place) it is hard to be 100% sure on such question.

Everyone seem agree to say that if you can cancel the cost it will cancel the benefit (the effect). Since you seem to haven't do anything I don't see any relevant situation where when need to now if it is possible ^^. But may be there is some time were it is useful (for example if you need to get our honour guard to be exhausted for a unknown reason).
