Does anyone know of the release date for the next AP, The Hills of Emyn Muil, or any future ones for that matter?

The upcoming section lists the release date for Emyn Muil as September, The Marshes in October and Return to Mirkwood in November. However, it also shows that Emyn Muil is still at the printers. If that's accurate, a September release seems overly optimistic. It may end up being more like early October.

The "at the printer" status has not been accurate for the last two sets, so I doubt it will be for Emyn Muil.

From what I gather about Chapter Pack cycles for Game of Thrones, the entire cycle is printed and shipped at one time.

 

[Total Speculation] I think it would follow that we won't see any of the sold out CPs until they reprint more.[/Total Speculation]

I was told that most (all?) the future German Mirkwood APs are stockpiling at the publishers warehouse. This should be the same for FFG. It makes perfectly sense to produce them all in one go (for printing price discount and shipping costs).

Shelf if that's true, then why on earth has there been such horrendous delays with release of product throughout Europe and the rest of the world?

Are the logistical management skills of FFG so poor that they can't keep to their own self nominated schedules?

I'm inclined to beleive these are  printed in batches - which would allow them to adjust levls of print run in response to sales of previous AP.

My educated guess is September 28th release for Emyn Muil

Because the original shipment with all the printed cards (=most/all APs) got delayed twice by Chinese custom controls on top of having had problems at the printers before - as far as I understand FFG/other distributors have them now all in stock... (All the cards - including the foreign editions - get printed at the same place)
