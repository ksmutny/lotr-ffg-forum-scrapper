For others wondering, I have received clarification on The Passage Out (Stage 3B) of The Druadan Forest.

 

Stage 3B (relevant text): Characters use their [Willpower] instead of [Attack] when attacking enemies. If an enemy would be damaged this way, place progress tokens on it instead of damage tokens. When an enemy has progress equal to its hit points, add it to the victory display and place those progress tokens on the quest.

So... there is a magical "printed" word that pop out of nowehere? :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

"Hit points" is different than "remaining hit points" is different than "printed hit points".

 

Printed Hit Points: The number it says on the card.

Remaining Hit Points: How much more damage an enemy must take before being killed.

Just Hit Points: The total number of damage it takes to kill an enemy. (This includes attachments that boost hit points.)

Hmm, is that in the core set rule book somewhere? The Core Set Rulebook actually states that the damage tokens give the character -1 Hit Point.  So under your interpretation that would mean the above situations would actually discard the enemy contrary to Caleb's ruling. 

 

I think this is simply an example of the Stage 3B card being worded poorly and it should read "printed hit points".
