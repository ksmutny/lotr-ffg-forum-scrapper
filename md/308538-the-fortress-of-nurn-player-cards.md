This is spirit Aragorn, really?Â

I believe Aragorn's text should read:Â "...where X is Aragorn'sÂ printedÂ willpower strength."

2 willpower 3 cost non-unique ally for tactics, ladies and gentlemen.

Halet is great and makes a very good toolkit ally and one of the top tierÂ contract promoted heroes in the game.Â 

Â 

Thorongil is fantastic. Think of Pippin heroes with this card.... joke aside, it opens a lot of theoretical deckbuilding possibilitiesÂ  for all heroes with 2 version or for all allies with at least one hero version of combined with motk

## 6 [Alonewolf87 on May 20, 2020](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/308538-the-fortress-of-nurn-player-cards/?do=findComment&comment=3941792)

Spirit Aragorn is kinda underwhelming (basically a disguised Argalad for locations) though the Scout trait could be interesting. It can perhaps be used with Thorongil, even though I would prefer to fuse Lore Aragorn with its Leadership or Tactics counterpart.

The contract could be interesting, not only for Hobbits, but the "exactly 10 card" restriction might prove bothersome.

Haleth is a good enabler for the Woodmen archetype, though a bit pricy. Woodmen Lore is kinda going against the theme of putting a lot of attachments on a single location.

The Westfold lancer is 2 Willpower for 3 cost in Tactics so quite good and its effect can be sometimes useful. Possibly a good card.

The Misty Mountain Journeyman is a good counterpart of the Northern Bowman from last pack, with both being quite at home in the usual Dunedain decks. Strange shenanings aside it might very well be the new Dunedain Pathfinder as cheap willpower for the Dunedain.

Knowledge of the Enemy is some much needed resource acceleration for Dunedain decks, but in general useful for those combat decks that tend to engage a lot of enemies for a Fellowship.

The Tireless Thoroughbred seems a bit overpriced (both as cost and by using a Restricted slot) for what it gives.

Shining Shield is the counterpart of the Sword from last back, only for Noble and with a larger effect when over 40 threat. Might be very good for Denethor and Boromir in Pillar of Kings Gondor Swarm decks (especially in combination with a Gondorian Shield) but there a lot of good target.

Thorongil can be really interesting, though I am not yet sure if the "gain" part of the text is meant as "in addition" or "substitution". If for example I can have a Lore/Tactics Aragorn which has the Warrior trait and both the -1 Defense and engagement ability of the Tactics version in addition to the lowering threat ability of the Lore version.

A Desperate Path can be awesome with encounter deck scrying and manipulation (or in the right quest knowing which treacheries are in the encounter deck), otherwise is too much of a gamble for my tastes. But when it hits it's surely spectacular.

Not sure to have understood how the contract works. 10 cards per each sphere makes 40. To have 50 cards , 10 are missing.Â  Does it mean 10 neutral cards are mandatory to use this contract? Not easy for most potential decks

10 cards not from the 4 basic spheres, which usually means neutral but in the Saga could also be Baggins or Fellowship cards.

Anyway with 2 Gandalf and 2 Good Harvest (which ina 4 sphere decks is basically mandatory) are basically locked down. In many decks the Envoy of Pelargir is a good resource smoother so that's another possibility. Ally Treebeard is one of the best ally around. Generally speaking depending on your deck there are quite a few good neutral attachment or allies you already include.

2 Gandalf and 2 good harvest, I think. The limit of 2 cards of the same title applies to neutral and saga spheres too.

I agree there are some very good neutral allies and cards but 10 is not a negligible number. 5 generally good neutral cards? Not sure, but ok let's try the contract in real lifeÂ  firstÂ

And by the way, we can have 6 heroes decks now, correct?

4 to begin with plus thalion plus sword thain.Â  Not worth the effort probably but yeah,Â  now we can

Indeed, I edited my messagge.

Let's take the tematic example of the contract art (an all hobbit deck) without using the Saga: we have Gandalf, The Shirefolk, Good Meal, Friend of Friend, the various Songs, The White Council, Hobbit-Sense, some guarded attachments, Gather Information and The Storm Comes.

By the way the idea of having a 5 attack Tactics Merry (or 6 with a Sword Thain Rosie) in the first saga quests is kinda intriguing ðŸ˜„

Seven in the Saga.

Yes with hobbit the 10 cards neutral are quite easy to fit in, less in other decks unless packing in a bunch of songs or master cards. But I cannot wait to build my hobbit deck with this contract.Â 

Â 

Merry in saga would kill sauron all by himself with a couple of dagger attached... nazgul be scared now...

Also another fun fact, with this contract we can now have decks that start the game in Valour, kinda curious to build one.

Or Dwarf decks starting the game with 5 dwarves (courtesy of Bombur), though I would still possibly prefer Bifur or Ori.

Yes, dwarf. I forgot how a 4th hero could push dwarf stetup up. Starting threat would be uncomfortable in early game, but the engine warm up in turn 1...

With a Bofur/Nori/Thorin Oakenshield/Thalin or Thorin Stonehelm lineup you start at 38 Threat, but with Nori around threat usually is not much of a problem. Though as I said I would prefer Oin instead of Bofur.

My takes:

SpAragorn's ability isn't dramatic, but I like having an Argalad for locations in the game.Â  There are few heroes where it's important to buff their willpower specifically; this will be one.

The contract should be fun to play, and now makes it easier to start in Valour if you're feeling aggressive....Â  Four hobbit decks will be the most common for theme, TaMerry, and Drinking Song.

Shining Shield looks fine, cheap +1/+2 that can go on a lot of nobles.

Knowledge of the enemy seems useful for Dunedain decks, but it's not an early accelerator, I don't see it being used much.

I like Haleth in a traps or woodmen deck, also will be a great addition to a Three RingsÂ deck.Â  Fantastic ability for MotK hero.

Woodman Lore likes distributed attachments, and a couple of woodmen allies really like loaded up locations; OTOH some location attachments don't mind being distributed (Power in the Earth, Thror's Key, Hithlain).Â  I don't see this card being used outside of a woodmen deck, and not guaranteed to see play there.

Misty Mountain Journeyman's use for a Dunedain deck is obvious, if it uses spirit (which most don't).Â  But it's fantastic value for any deck that expects to have an enemy engaged during planning sometime, which covers a lot of decks.

A Desparate Path is interesting, the first card to search out a treachery.Â  This card is going to be very quest dependent, but if you know you can survive whatever treachery turns up this a very powerful card for YOLO questing.

Westfold Lancer is great willpower value for Tactics, and a fantastic option for Lothriel.

I think the price is fair for Tireless Thoroughbred, but the cost of a restricted slot makes it tough to put on a hero unless Elfhelm is in play.Â  Being able to put it on a character is nice, but aside from Beorn, Soldier of Erebor and maybe Gimli I'm not seeing a lot of likely targets.

Thorongil is expensive; which alternate-hero abilities are worth spending 3 to get the ability and a sphere match?

Aragorn -- adding LoAragorn's one-time ability is certainly worth 3.Â  TaAragorn's passive -1 defense to enemies would also be handy.

Beregond -- adding SpBeregond's threat reduction to TaBeregond is certainly worth 3.

Bilbo -- giving LoBilbo the extra willpower and damage would be great, as would giving TaBilbo the extra card draw.

Boromir -- both abilities are potentially useful to the other version.

Brand -- no joy here, LeBrand isn't ranged and TaBrand won't be in a Dale deck.

Dain -- giving SpDain the global dwarf boost seems worth three, but a defense boost isn't worth 3 for LeDain.

Denethor -- 3 to add LoDenethor's scrying to LeDenethor is worth it.

Eomer -- since characters don't generally leave play before Eomer commits to the quest, there's no synergy here, but adding LeEomer's ability to TaEomer might be worth 3 once the Galadriel/Herugrim combo is set up.

Eowyn -- one time ready and +9 attack is worth 3.

Faramir -- LoFaramir with LeFaramir's ally readying would be nice in an Ent deck.Â  If LeFaramir is in an ent deck, the sphere addition is actually useful, though LoFaramir's ability may not be worth the cost even with that.

Frodo -- while the two responses are in different activities, they are both strong enough to be worth 3 cost.

Gimli -- attack and defend abilities don't synergize, not worth 3 in either direction.

Glorfindel -- LoGlorfindel's healing isn't worth 3

Legolas -- adding the progress to SpLegolas may be worth 3 if he's routinely readied for attack.

Merry -- with cheap readying, I think combining these may be worth 3.Â  Note that SpMerry gets his attack 1 higher than TaMerry does in an all-hobbit deck.Â  Saga SpMerry with the new contract and Thorongil....

Pippin -- if you were running SpPippin for some unknown reason, adding LoPippin's useful ability would certainly be worth 3.

Imrahil -- 3 is expensive for a once-per-round conditional ready, but adding TaImrahil's ability to LeImrahil might be worth 3.

Theoden -- adding TaTheoden's ability depends on how many Tactics heroes are around, it would at least buff Theoden by one and the tactics symbol may also be useful.

Now let's consider which motk ally turned hero could benefit from thorongil (I believe the combo is legal, no?)

First coming to my mind

Ally Legolas plus TaLegolas

Ally Faramir plus LeFaramir

Ally pippin plus LoPippin

Ally Sam plus Le sam

Others?

Ally Arwen + Arwen

Ally Beorn plus Beorn sadly won't work....

Ally SpElfhelm + Elfhelm

Ally Elrohir/Elladan + hero version

Ally arwen plus arwen, how could I forget... welcome the fusion of two among the best cards in the game...

It makes pivotal to fetch thorongil in early game.

And speaking of the new aragoron,Â  in addition to a meh ability also the art is quite bad too.Â 

After so many years waiting for Sp aragorn I have to say I'm very disappointed by him. Bad artÂ  bad ability, no real new/pumped up synergy with any of his traits. No warrior or noble trait too.

Really, really disappointed.Â 

Not a new Sp pippin of course, but let's be honest all the community was expecting him to be a great hero and not a below avg ones.

Â 

That's life. Thank the developers for thorongil even if I wished it was a contract and not an attachment to fetch and pay for.

The most satisfying two turns you can hope for...Â 

Â 

3 taking into account Lo Aragorn ability which will definitely shine in this particular deck....

(extending you threat durability by 50% isÂ huge boost)

So these are really the cards and not just speculation/player created cards? My first reaction is I'm not crazy about the art on Aragorn but Thorongil is really good.

I think A Desperate Path is the stand out card for me. Risky as someone else said, but a lot of fun! I also liked the art on it, and saw that that it is the same artist as Spiragorn. Â

If you want you can even start at 50 with a Treebeard/Saruman/Elrond + Gwaihir + SpTheoden + LeAragorn lineup for the quickest loss ever.

Very disappointing pack. I truly hope we have more cycles after this hiatus. There is still plenty to get to. We have a 8+ thread of cards we still want and I don't think we received anything in this pack, besides a disappointing Sparrowgorn.Â 

Thorongil and Helm of Secrecy are exciting yet not so powerful cards. I think that might be the only redeeming value here.

We finally got our 4 hero contract but boy do those restrictions really narrow the field of possible decks you can run.Â 

Â 

Perhaps not a terrible pack for a random cycle pack #4 (changing the name of aragorn to Halbarad or something), but if this truly is the last pack then it saddens me that the swan song of the game did not live up to expectations.

I, too, am disapointed from that hero'sÂ (not really worth mentioning Aragorn here) ability.

To bad, cannot useÂ AÂ Test of Will on the when revealed from A Desperate Path. ðŸ˜„

I do like the buff for Dunedain. Finaly. That theme deserves more love.

And a good buff to Warrior charaters. Like it.

Thorongil: reads to me asÂ the hero then have both the abilities,Â traits and resource icons (not 'printed' I guess). But not 100% sure. Not a native speaker or gaming nerd. ðŸ˜‰

And last but not least: The contract. I want to see all the non-hobbit decks comming up. Cannot be many, but still. Maybe Noldor? They do have some threat reduction at hands.

I am disappointed too in general about the cards in this last pack, but I have the suspicion that they might have been designed before (or around the same time) the decision for the hiatus hit.

Dwarves seem like a good fit and also some Gondor Swarm decks. Possibly Silvan and Rohan?

Thought about that, too. ButÂ Boromir [https://ringsdb.com/card/05002],Â LothÃ­riel [https://ringsdb.com/card/22027],Â Prince Imrahil [https://ringsdb.com/card/12138]Â + X ? These alone are 30 threat.

Silvan sounds good. ðŸ™‚

Technically, Thorongil is "pay 3 to do nothing" thanks to the uniqueness rule.

Lore Denethor, Damrod for some traps or Lore Faramir. Starting in Valour might not so bad for Gondor decks (Soldier of Gondor, Angbor the Fearless, Horn's Cry, Defender of Cair Andros, Honour Guard, Veteran of Osgiliath). You can then use Secret Vigil, Woodmen Clearing and some spirit card to reduce your threat (also Favor of the Valar, even Pillar of the Kings if need be)

I guess since what's in play is not the new hero but Thorongil (to which the hero is attached) you can bypass the uniqueness rule. Could it have been better written? Probably. But the intent is really clear.

No interest whatsoever in that Aragorn. The art stinks (disappointing too cause that artist has done much better work for the game), and the ability is lazy AF.

"Argalad for locations" is fine for an FFG-created DÃºnedain character in some rando pack in a cycle, but for the final hero of the game, and Aragorn at that? Ridiculous.

## 38 [EBerling on May 20, 2020](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/308538-the-fortress-of-nurn-player-cards/?do=findComment&comment=3942025)

I think there was a lot of pressure hanging on the shoulders of this last pack, given just how many cards and mechanics people were still hoping to see in what could be the final pack ever.Â  That's too much pressure for any one AP, but I do agree that this feels like perhaps the least exciting of the APs from this cycle.


I am really glad to see the Woodman them further explored, though.

HalethÂ is really good, probably the stand-out card for me from this set.Â Â 

It's nice to see the Woodman theme getting more attention, but Woodman's Lore seems iffy to me.Â  Haldan should already be questing unexhausted, so unless you need him to fight twice this isn't a great card for him.Â  For Woodman allies, not sure how valuable this will be -- I don't think you typically have more than one attachment on a location at a time (especially in 1-Handed where even getting a location can be a challenge).Â  For 1 Lore resource, I'd probably rather just save up and pay for another ally entirely than probably just ready one.

Would still love (would have loved) to have seen some sort card(s) that allowed Woodmen to fish for locations, place progress / travel easier (Woodman's Axe?), and most importantly something that let them add attachments to locations that areÂ "Immune to Player Card" effects.Â  I know particular locations aren't meant to be brushed away by Thror's Key or swept under the rug by Asfaloth/Trackers, but in quests that have locations immune to player cards it's even less of an opportunity to Location-Attachment strategies to work. Nothing (mechanically) wrong with putting Woodman's Clearing on the The Carrock, for instance.Â  One of the same issues with the Burglar Contract.

Not a fan of Aragorn's art at all. No disrespect meant to the artist. It's a very good picture just not the one I'd have used to depict Aragorn. He looks like a hipster version of Rowan Atkinson.Â 

Aragorn is in fact Lord Blackadder IIÂ 

I called spirit Aragorn ages ago for being the last hero. I'm sure I read or heard one of the designers say there would only ever be one hero from all the spheres.Â 

I like his ability but not his art. He also reminds me of the Minas Tirith Lampright.

I have to agree, I find the pack probably the most underwhelming of the whole cycle. Aragorn in particular is pretty underwhelming.

I like to make a positive comment when I make a negative comment but, man... none of the cards speak to me really. I guess maybe the contract is interesting?Â 

Â 

edit: oh I get it now. You're not supposed to ever have this spirit Aragorn on his own. Always use him as an attachment with Thorongil or use another ARagorn to attach to him. I guess that works.

Via Thorongil, Spiragorn does have some powerful synergy with Leadagorn's innate readying ability. You could both nuke a location and then quest on top of it. If you can load up Aragorn with willpower, could (maybe) be worth it to get the setup in place. Actually, a Gray Wanderer version of this with Strider could be cool.

I've always found LoAragorn's ability least exciting -- even though it's the largest threat reduction effect in the game, if you end up not needing it his text might as well be blank.Â  SpAragorn needs three resources and Thorongil to acquire that ability now, and I think his ability *will* be useful.Â  If there's a location, he can wait until after staging to decide whether to "quest" via threat reduction or stay ready for combat, and that's not a bad thing for Spirit.Â  Too bad Thorongil is unique.Â  Hmm, maybe instead of ignoring uniqueness to play four Aragorns, I should just run one Aragorn with four abilities...

Forest Road Ranger is the Woodman who could get buffed with a lot of location attachments, though that only counts as one ready for the card.Â  I like readying Mirkwood Explorer to nuke a newly revealed location, but Leather Boots is the tool for that job.

I love Spirit Aragorn (Ladagorn)! He may not be the most powerful hero, but he is definitely better than Argalad who he is obviously has a similar ability to. Argalad is in effect questing with attack, while Ladagorn is using willpower. So you can give him a Silver Circlet and Unexpected Courage to have him be a beast of a quester!Â 

Thorongil is great with MotK! Bilbo can come in for 4 threat and grab a spare pipe for the hitpoints and an attachment. Then either of the hero abilities are great additions!

Pippin with Lore Pippin's ability is great for card draw and ensuring his abilities work.

3 cost is a high entry point ... it's hard to find cards I would definitely want to use this with.Â Â YouÂ  end up very much wanting to cheat this into play, and there are few ways to do that with an attachment.Â Â 

Here's a fun thought experiment. Someone else gives you control of their hero temporarily via Desperate Alliance.Â  If that hero is a Messenger of the King 'hero,' you could then attach a hero version to that. So, you could have someone starting the game with MotK Faramir and attach the leadership hero version to that instead.Â  Start the game with MotK Gimli and attach the tactics hero version to him.Â  A way to start the game with the ability that fits your deck best, even if it's the ally version. In some cases, starting with much lower threat. Just a thought.

Â 

It's a pity this doesn't allow you to use an ally version of that hero, that would make so many more options available. At first I thought you could, but the last couple of lines on the card make it very clear that the other version needs to be a hero card.

I don't exactly understand the Desperate Alliance part...

Anyway yes the Messenger of King - Thorongil many combos seems quite intriguing.

Since it's just an attachment, not a contract, there's no need for Desparate Alliance.Â  It will work fine to attach a hero version to a MotK hero, though that will still have the MotK stats, taking some of the lure away from Thorongimli.

It's a shame you can't use multiple contracts, MotK would make the threat requirements for 4-hero much less onerous.

I'm not sure about Beorn ability vs MotK -- MotK is immune to card effects, after all.Â  But "cannot" usually trumps all.Â  However, Thorongil is *not* immune, so certainly would fall off when Beorn is attached, at which point Beorn hero would be removed.

A little late but here are some of my thoughts.

Aragorn - I think he is actually good despite some of the communities disappointment. His threat is high and his ability is exactly mirrored by Argalads, making him less exciting. But he is splashable and I love that. His traits are good too. He is in sphere for silver circlet and unexpected courage, which can make him a questing beast.

Shining Shield - love it. Fits right in my gondor valour deck. Put this and valiant sword on boromir and Imrahil. Also great for gimli and Theoden.

KotE - great in a dunedain deck. People have said the dunedain allies are too expensive; I wager this card will fix that.Â 

Rohirrim Lancer - 2 willpower for 3 cost on a non-unique? Great, but amazing with Lothiriel. Put Gamling out and do it every round.

Valiant Steed - a little pricy, not too many good targets. Gimli maybe.

Haleth - very good, 2 willpower and some card draw. If you can afford it, play it.

Woodman lore - its ok. Nothing too great.

MM journeyman - hes good. That 1 htp makes me nervous but he is easy to play.

Perilous Journey - so cool. Risky, but the effect is powerful. Love the high risk, high reward feel.

BoF - this contract looks good. I am surprised at how many people think its not that powerful. Hobbits will be best with it, followed by Dwarves. I don't think the limitations are hard to build around at all.

All in all, a good pack. Not quite what I expected for the final, but I think Caleb Grace has done a great job on this cycle/game, and I applaud his hard work.

I think they should,Â  otherwise no hero would actually benefit from thorongil.Â 

And at the end + 2 attack plus payable readying a ability for 3 resources it's good but not so OP, especially in a world where the combo Stewardof gondor+gondorian fire exists...

Mpre so when it is likely to be a mid game situation as you haveÂ to draw thorongil in the first place.Â

I don't see any reason why it wouldn't work twice.Â  After all, you can certainly have multiple attachments that boost your defense with the same text.

+4 attack/defense with repeatable readying....

My initial review on the cards:

Â 

A desperate path is very interesting, potentially super powerful or game-ending depending on scenario, and you canâ€™t cancel it. Maybe the best side board card card in the game?

Â 

Woodman Lore, how easy is it to get a ton of locations in play and have attachments on them all? At most I can see this readying one or two stronger characters, not the most impressive but it fits their style and with Burglar youâ€™ll always get one ready out of it so costed appropriately.

Â 

Â 

Knowledge of the Enemy, now this was what Dunedain needed! Great resource acceleration rewarding you for accomplishing the finicky task that engaging a bunch of enemies is.

Â 

Shining Shield, amazing, my second favourite card this pack. Simple but stackable with Gondorian Shield on Boromir or other high cost noble Gondorian defenders like Eleanor that will pump them up to +4 cheaply and easily.

Â 

Tireless Thoroughbred, another mount is always welcome, and what a great boost for warriors. You have to consider the restricted slot as well but if you are running a tactics hero in an Eagles deck where support of the eagles can be in play this card is a great mini-gwahir hero card.

Â 

Thorongil, this is an excellent card and one of the more exciting ones in the pack. There are so many cool options that look like they have been broken down in this thread already. Iâ€™m most excited for MOTK Legolas being able to get Tactics Legolasâ€™s ability. The MOTK interactions are great!

Â 

Misty Mountain Journeyman, any Dunedain support was direly needed so happy that this helps cover a weak point.

Â 

Westfold Lancer, one of the best Rohan allies and very fitting with their new heroes and an always useful effect.

Â 

Haleth, she is the ally Lore Anborn equivalent for Woodman decks, with some use outside of them if you are running heavy attachments. Solid stats and MOTK candidate too. The art is a bit weird in my opinion as she looks like she gave herself a self-Quarantine haircut and we have never seen anyone else in LOTR sporting modern hairstyles so why start now? Where are our crew-cut Gondorians? Or MohawkÂ Dunedain?Â Just kind of kills the theme a bit for me. But stats/ability she is fine.

Â 

Spirit Aragorn, reviewing him here to end on a high note. Honestly disappointed. His ability isnâ€™t bad on a hero, argalad sees some fringe use and this will as well. Itâ€™s nice to be able to adjust your questing post staging, and you can use it as really costly location control as well, butÂ itâ€™s not a final Aragorn ability. There is no synergy with Arwen/the elves, or the Dunedain, or Gondor or really anyone. Itâ€™s not a very flashy or exciting ability unlike the other Aragorns, it has no synergy with Aragorn having many spheres (which many, myself includedÂ were all hoping for) and other than Sword That Was Broken (something out of sphere) it has no synergy with most of the Aragorn-specific attachments. I can get that they were maybe trying to stick with pre War of the Ring Aragorn,Â but theÂ missed opportunity to ever have King Elessar in the game and unite the spheres while boosting Gondor/Arwen is almost unforgivable. Iâ€™m really hoping there is more after the break now to rectify this.Â 

Also that artwork is atrocious. Not that it was badly done skill-wise,Â so no discredit to the artist if they were going for this. Also he has shown he can create amazing artwork including solid takes on heroes (Lanwyn, Cirdan) and not so solid art (Spirit Legolas, Radagast). So if the intent was to create an homeless drunk it has succeeded. Creepy unkempt beard, bad sex eyes, quite overweightÂ for being an athletic wingfoot, and doesnâ€™t know how to hold a torch despite supposedly being an experienced scout. If I saw this Aragorn in a cave I would carefully set my bag of gold on the ground andÂ back away slowly. Compare it to literally any of the other Aragorns and even Hercules-build Aragorn from the core set is way more kingly and noble than this cave dweller. I would vote this as being the worst art in the game and if I get around to overcoming my disappointment with this Aragorn Iâ€™ll definitely be using an Alt-Art. It doesnâ€™t help that there is no Anduril guarded attachment either. My wife has loved playing with all the Aragornâ€™s before and is outright disappointed that this is the latest and potentially final iteration. Alright rant over and moving on.Â 

Â 

Bond of Friendship, now this card is exciting. Many decks are already tri-sphere, Hobbits, Rohan, Silvan, Gondor to make a few so being able to add a fourth hero in exchange for some deck-building restrictions is an amazing deal. Absolutely love the possibilities with this card, and while it may feel geared towards hobbits and low threat heroes Iâ€™m much more interested in taking it into the 40s and starting out with 4 powerful characters ready to crush the forces of Sauron. Bring on the valour abilities and easily my second favourite contract behind three hunters.

Â 

Overall player cards 7/10

Hero 2/10Â

Itâ€™s nice to be able to adjust your questing post staging, and you can use it as really costly location control as well, butÂ itâ€™s not a final Aragorn ability. There is no synergy with Arwen/the elves, or the Dunedain, or Gondor or really anyone. Itâ€™s not a very flashy or exciting ability unlike the other Aragorns, it has no synergy with Aragorn having many spheres (which many, myself includedÂ were all hoping for) and other than Sword That Was Broken (something out of sphere) it has no synergy with most of the Aragorn-specific attachments. I can get that they were maybe trying to stick with pre War of the Ring Aragorn,Â but theÂ missed opportunity to ever have King Elessar in the game and unite the spheres while boosting Gondor/Arwen is almost unforgivable. Iâ€™m really hoping there is more after the break now to rectify this.Â

Also he has shown he can create amazing artwork including solid takes on heroes (Lanwyn, Cirdan) and not so solid art (Spirit Legolas, Radagast). So if the intent was to create an homeless drunk it has succeeded. Creepy unkempt beard, bad sex eyes, quite overweightÂ for being an athletic wingfoot, and doesnâ€™t know how to hold a torch despite supposedly being an experienced scout. If I saw this Aragorn in a cave I would carefully set my bag of gold on the ground andÂ back away slowly. Compare it to literally any of the other Aragorns and even Hercules-build Aragorn from the core set is way more kingly and noble than this cave dweller. I would vote this as being the worst art in the game and if I get around to overcoming my disappointment with this Aragorn Iâ€™ll definitely be using an Alt-Art. It doesnâ€™t help that there is no Anduril guarded attachment either. My wife has loved playing with all the Aragornâ€™s before and is outright disappointed that this is the latest and potentially final iteration. Alright rant over and moving on.Â

2 things.

1st is Haleth, you really nailed what I was feeling when I saw this art. I first thought it was a monk looking dude, but upon closer inspection it appears to be a woman. I really dislike that haircut too. Very not fitting in the theme of lotr lcg.

Secondly, Aragorns art. I too was a little shocked at the poor art. But looking at the artist I was even more surprised. Alexander Karez is currently (since Magali left) my favorite artist for this game. He has done some great pieces including Hirgon and Thalion. I was just so surprised.

I just thought of a great use for Sp Aragorn. He would be great in a grey wanderer deck, having strider lets him quest for 4 and use his ability should a location come up. If its enemies, just keep him up for that 3 att or sentinel for someone.Â 

In solo if you have a few locations come up in the 1st couple rounds he will be able to contribute a lot to the quest and failing will be unlikely.

For sure cave creeper AragornÂ would work there.Â Iâ€™ve been using Argalad as a wanderer and it has been pretty solid, almost as good as Haldir who I think is the best one.Â

I guess a good target for the Thoroughbred would be Na'asiyah. Or more in general in a Fellowship any hero without those Keywords relying heavily on Blood of Numenor/Gondorian Fire (let's say TaBoromir)

I'm hoping it's more than a minimal residual chance of it being fake. With all the extra time they've had I can't believe the game is going on hiatus with that Aragorn for both game text and art as the last hero.

I think this pack is totally fine, the disappointment people feel probably is mostly because this could potentially be the final AP ever which is a lot to live up to and the first thing we see is that Aragorn..

Which is a totally welcome and serviceable Aragorn- It just doesn't "wow" at all and has tragically poor art. I think if this was released in a different AP or had epic art in this one, people wouldn't be so down on it. I am hoping that a promo or quality alter pops up on the market at some point for sure.

The contract seems pretty interesting/Strong, albeit with obvious drawbacks but also a lot of possibilities. Not only does your board state start off stronger but you are getting more mana(admittedly not color matching mana) so you can churn out a lot of board presence easily, either small and cheap allys or using cards like a good harvest to boost out bigger guys. Also anything that benefits from multiple things that share types etc. is great here, not to mention valor action decks.Â 

Haleth seems awesome- as good as the master of the forge is, I think I might like a beefier version of him with some relevant types/stats- Also a veryÂ intriguing choice for messenger of kings

Westfold Lancer isn't that good in general, but with Theodens discount, and more importantly Lothriel cheating him in, he is quite strong IMO

Misty mountain Journeyman is really solid for relevant decks

Thorongil has a lot of possibilities that I haven't considered once you factor in messenger of kings, but immediately loreagorn and Eowyn stand out as powerful targets. I think one of the more interesting ways of playing this will be to have multiple heroes that could benefit from it, thus having it be a toolbox of sorts, for example if you draw it on the cusp of threating out, get loreagorn to save you, if you get it early on, put it on Arwen, if you are fighting a tough enemy put it on Eowyn, etc.- I'd bet there are far more interesting uses but those blunt ones come to mind.

Not sure I like tireless thoroughbred but there are a lot of warrior characters in the game. This is probably the dud of the set for me, but perhaps I am undervaluing how nice it will be to have in four player games where those keywords value is higher.

Shining shield isn't flashy, but I like it. Dunedain Warning is an incredible card, and while this is obviously more narrow, it has the upside of having the ability to be twice as potent. Its niche, but not bad by any means.

Knowledge of the enemy is a bit weird since you can only use it during the planning phase, but it has an insane ceiling and could be quite interesting in Dunedain decks and the like.Â 

Woodman lore is not something I expected, but I dig it. It will often be 1 mana to untapped your board, more or less, and its even more appealing with Haleth being added to the game. Perhaps I am overvaluing it from how powerful other mass-readying cards can be

A desperate path is insanely powerful, but obviously a double edged sword. It really comes down to how devastating the encounters treacheries are. For example it would be totally not viable vs. battle of Carin dum, but in some cases keeping a board combat ready and getting a boost to quest will far outweigh the average treachery. I like that, by design, its an "oh crap" button, which might sometimes be worth pressing even vs. harsh encounter decks if you're on a turn you'll lose anyways.Â 

Â 

All in all its a good and exciting pack, but naturally I too would prefer seeing more, which I hope we get when the LOTR amazon series airs and they have the sense to ride the hype wave. We shall see

New Aragorn might be strong with Grey Pilgrim contract. Pick thematic Strider and you can effectively quest for 8+1 progress turn 1, and still have actions ready to defend. But whatâ€™s sad to me is that we donâ€™t have Aragorn ally, so when we travel to Prancing Pony we canâ€™t play him, although it looksÂ like that is the intention. Maybe we can create and playtest are own Aragorn ally as a community?

Spirit Aragorn is not one of the most obvious heroes to use like Saruman and Lotheriel, but with the right build, he could be a phenomenal hero! He wants Silver Circlet, Unexpected Courage, Thorongil could be good. In a Grey Wanderer deck, Strider is great too. I could see Silver Lamp being really good too.

Â 
Very true, but there are some reasons to want Lore Aragorn as a starting hero.Â  For instance, you might want a quick Sentinel with Burning Brand, in which case Loragorn is the best contender.Â  He's also good if you want to exploit back-to-back Pillars of Kings: play Pillars, draw 4 cards, use Aragorn to go back to starting threat, play Pillars again for another 4 cards.Â  Hard to argue with a +6 card swing early in the game.Â  He can also be great as a Gray Wanderer (or paired with Smeagol and MotK-Ioreth/Gleowine/etc) if you want to exploit a bunch of Doomed early in the game (e.g. Deep Knowledge, Seeing-Stone, etc.), but then want to go return back to starting Threat for exploiting Secrecy cards.

How does it work if you have Thorongil, use lore Aragornâ€™s reset, get Thorongil discarded somehow, then reattach it and get lore Aragornâ€™s ability back? Would this leaving play and coming back reset the counter? Itâ€™s not even coming from lore Aragorn himself, itâ€™s just card text granted from Thorongil... so Iâ€™m wondering if that would circumvent the usual restrictions.
Â 

Wouldnt really be overpowered, as you wouldnâ€™t be able to set that up yourself, short of killing Aragorn and using another card to bring him back. Unless the encounter deck does it for you, there isnâ€™t a voluntary way to discard Thorongil.Â

I am not 100% sure but I feel like being able to trigger loragorns ability twice on 1 player wont be allowed. Thorongil definitely makes for some interesting playstyles but it does complicate things too.Â

While Loragorn's card leaves play, the actual Aragorn wouldn't, so if he gets the text restored that says "once per game", it's still just once a game.Â  It's no different than if he lost the once per game text to a text-blanking treachery and subsequently got it back -- it doesn't reset a per game counter.

I'm also reasonably confident that if the original Loragorn were killed and brought back, it wouldn't reset his once per game counter -- if it worked that way, Caldara's once-per-game errata would be pointless.

If you use Helm of Secrecy on a hero who has Thorongil attached--- I presume the new hero entering play, and you'd just trigger the Thorongil response freshly? (if there are even targets for it in your collection)

That seems a little more iffy.Â  Likely intended behavior is to use the "eligible attachment" so that it can only be applied to new heroes who can fetch their own Thorongil version...

But it'd be way more cool if you can just move Thorongil, since after all the second hero version is attached to Thorongil and *not* the hero itself directly.Â  I would expect that if Keeping Count were moved, it would retain its resources, why not the same for Thorongil?Â  After all, there's no eligibility requirement for Thorongil to be attached to a hero, and the card is clear that the attached hero card is not removed unless Thorongil itself leaves play, which it wouldn't.Â  Mixing the two effects together opens a ton of possibilities (which for seven cost, it really should!)

Better yet, when attaching it to the new hero, you can trigger the response again!Â  You can be double Thorongil.

That's what i figured could happen to get at least 3 of the 4 aragorns in. Start with blue, play thorongil to get green, play helm of secrecy to swap blue with red and then trigger thorongil again. Voila!

You have green, red and purple Aragorn with blue in your box. I guess blue aragorn is good for something.

So this is the first time this language occurs, as nothing else can trigger upon attachment besides dunedain remedy. However, I would say that if it was moved from one character to another, it goes from unattached to attached. Using some intermediate value theorem logic, I would have to assume that's an attachment process. For normal attachments, theres a "play" move, a "put into play" move, and then "attach" move as separate and distinct moves.Â

But the text on Brand is when you "play" an attachment. The restriction on thorongil does not suggest that you have to play it in order to trigger it's ability. If it did, you could not trigger it with vilya or thrors ring. The language is after it is attached, not after it is played.

Like i said, this is new language but i would assume with it coming with aragorn's pack i would assume that the intention would be to be able to combine as many aragorns as possible.

I apologise if this has been asked before, but do we know if this cycle was developed after the desicion to end the game? If not, maybe this was supposed to be a generic dÃºnadan, and then they thought "the game will end, and we need a spirit Aragorn, let's change this guy's name".Â

From my memory, Caleb said in a Cardtalk episode that they were planning on doing a Rhun cycle when they were told that it would be the final cycle. So it is entirely possible that some things were already planned, but it seems unlikely to me that this ability was on another Dunadan and just stitched onto Aragorn. It just seems to generic of an ability. But who knows?

I am really looking forward to makingÂ Bond of Friendship work with hobbits. If you want to start with Frodo, Sam, Pippin, and Merry (the big 4),Â the only way to play it is: Sp Frodo, Le Sam, Lo Pippin, and Ta Merry for 27 threat. But I think I came up with an idea to end with the big 4.Â Â Start with Le Frodo, Sp Merry, Lo Folco, and Ta Tom for 24 threat. Discard Folco to reduce threat, Helm of Secrecy Tom into Sam, Thorongil Sp Merry with Ta Merry, and Sword-Thain Pippin. And it is extremely thematic. Folco was there to move Frodo. Tom and Sam were best friends. Adding Ta Merry shows his growth at Pelennor Fields.Â Pippin was Denethorâ€™s sword-thain.Â

Woof. That's 11 resources in 3 cards, one of which is a 1 per deck...

Itâ€™s fun to dream, right?

Do you think they'll announce the pack in 2020?

Im starting to wonder if they will just skip the announcement and release it normally. Its been ridiculously long already

Sparagorn is definitely more powerfull than he is given credit for right now. If you compare him to Argalad you're on the wrong track. I would argue he is a superior Coragorn.

Â 

Argalad is a lore hero that can quest using his attack power, but only under the condition that an enemy was revealed/is in the staging area. And he then deals 1 damage to that enemy. But if no enemy shows up Argalad is just sitting there and if an enemy does show up, you might need his attack power more. Therefore he really needs direct damage support to truly shine.

Â 

Coragorn is a leadership hero that you can spend 1 resource on, to send him on the quest without exhausting. His main role is attacker/defender but by spending 1 resource you can get 2 more willpower this turn. That is an ok ability. However if you do not reveal an enemy then your resource was jsut spend for ensurance. Coragorns weakness is that you have to decide before the reveal.

Â 

Sparagorn has this last part as innate ability. You can simply reveal the encounter card and then decide if you want to use him for willpower or combat. If you reveal a location you use his ability, if you reveal an enemy you keep him ready. That is very powerful in the first 2 turns of the game. Coragorn can of course do both if you pay a resource, butÂ the Sparagorn player can pay for unexpected courage with the same resource cost as 2 activations and blow Coragorn out of the water. Sparagorn with UC can double questÂ (send him to the quest, ready him, reduce threat of location) or quest and combat or double combat. This makes him increadibly flexible with only 1 in-sphere card. Better yet, every Willpower enhancer on him is twice as effective because you can use his willpower twice a turn, making cards like silver circlet 4 WP for 2 resources. And that's ignoring the 1 progress token bonus.

Â 

His flexibility makes him a great target for crazy combo's too. Sparagorn + Unexpected Courage + Silver Circlet + Idraen + Spare hood and cloakÂ + Northern trackers/Rhovanion outriders. Quest with everybody, ready Sparagorn, have him clear a location in the staging area, trigger Idraen to ready, have her give the cloak to ready Sparagorn, clear the active location, ready Idraen again and you end up with two competent fighters for the combat phase.Â

I gotta say your pitch for sparagorn is probably the best I've seen, but I am not convinced he is so great out the gate. He is definitely better in multiplayer, and I would argue he would be a solid hero if the limit to his ability was once per phase. In solo, though, Coragorn is top notch.Â 

As you laid out, a lot of Sparagorns strength comes conditionally on 1) the card you draw and 2) the cards that come from staging. The strength of coragorn is that he does not need any help -- he has two actions each round (commit to the quest + attack/defend) for the cost of one resource. Everything you add to him just further strengthens his out the gate ability (celebrian stone makes questing stronger, courage removes the cost to ready, theodred essentially pays for aragorn, etc). You will always have questing and almost always have combat. The question becomes whether or not you want to spend the money to have him ready for combat. No enemies? Perhaps it's risky. One or more? Spend it.

Now with sparagorn, the option becomes: commit to the quest for guaranteed questing, or hope that a location pops so that you can possibly lay one progress down (if WP >= threat). Of course, if there is a location already in staging, sure, for the cost of exhausting a hero, "quest" and MAYBE get a progress. Again. That depends on whether or not you have 1) a 2 or less threat location 2) you have some juice to his will power. And for one progress... ever since Asfaloth has emerged, the number of <= 2 QP locations have become next to nil, which means you are either 3 or more turns away from clearing a location in staging or you essentially get 1 progress extra on locations you travel to.Â 

There are little adjustments that would make him on par with Coragorn in my opinion:

1) don't have him exhaust to trigger his ability -- pay a different cost. Resource, discard a card from your hand, deck... raise your threat by 1. Exhausting a hero is a very expensive trigger.

2) lower the threat cost. Stats are good, per usual aragorn status, but that 12, in the past, has paid for:

-defense drop and extra engagements

-ability to ready

-have the highest threat reduction possibility in the game.

One of the primary reasons individuals aren't mad about argalad is that his stat line is decent, but costs 3 less. Glorfindel allowed for us to change cost of heroes, and I could have seen them do it here too.

3) change the ability to once per phase -- with readying he could become the best location control hero in the game.

4) two progress instead of 1 allows a faster clearing process.

Â 

All of these are aragorn-esque, bringing with him up to speed with the rest of them. If I see "oh with 5 cards and a hero he's great" all I can think is "yeah 5 cards on lore bilbo and he could be a superstar too."

I was never in love with coragorn, but as mid or late game quester he can be impressive once play on him sword that was broken and calabrian stone, both I'm sphere. Than he can quest 5 for 1 token which is great payoff considering you might have spare purple token in late game

But Sp Arargorn doesn't need 5 cards to be good. Hes in sphere for courage and silver circlet, that is enough. Also I disagree with your comment on the exhaustion being too high a price. I would rather exhaust him than spend a resource. Spirit resources are harder to come by than leadership. His threat is high but hes not weak enough to warrant a discount.Â
