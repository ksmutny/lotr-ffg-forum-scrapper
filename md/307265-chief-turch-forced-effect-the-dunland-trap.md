In the Dunland Trap, some card, including Dunlending Ambush, make search an enemy in the encounter deck and "put it into play engaged with a player".

Does it trigger the Chief Turch forced effect which reads

I am sure you guys have encountered this situation in the past. With my 2 solo games, it already happened several times (an I guess it happens even more in multiplayer).

Yes, the enemy physically entered your play area so it has engaged you.

I initialy thought that Dunlending Ambush put the enemy already engaged with the player and did not trigger the response of Chief Turch. I had a doubt though.

It seems that for once I made the game harder that it was.

Thanks for your response.
