Good morning,

 

I have a deck using heroes from 2 different spheres of influence.

 

I know I can only spend resource tokens from a hero on cards from the same sphere of influence.

 

However, can I use an attachment on a hero from another sphere of influence or not? e.g. Self Preservation (Lore) attachment onto Aragorn (Leadership hero).

 

Many thanks in advance.

 

JJ

Yes =) Attachments themselves will actually list their limitations.

For example for self preservation it simply reads: "attach to a character". This means you can actually put it on any hero and any ally as well.

Dunedain Mark reads "attach to a hero", this means it can be attached to any hero but not allies.
Rohan Warhorse however reads "attach to a tactics or rohan hero", this means it can only be attached to heros that are of the tactics sphere or have Rohan as one of their traits.

Many, many thanks. I don't envisage any more questions, for today anyway!
