where it says 'end the quest phase without resolving the quest' does that mean end it there and then without drawing any more enocunter cards, or does it mean complete the staging step and then end without resolving

thanks

This is precisely the question that I came on looking for an answer to. 

 

I interpreted it as "end the questing phase" as in *boom* it ends. I think if staging was supposed to be completed, it would have stated more along the lines of "don't resolve the quest after staging". I think thematically it makes more sense to just end it too; if you know that you're following a false lead, you're not going to keep poking into whatever cranies that are revealing these enemies and locations.

 

I do wish the card was worded more precisely.

got an official answer

False Lead ends the quest phase when it is revealed. Do not continue staging.

good to know… I am pretty sure I played this one wrong already!

This is how we have been playing it. We still had to ask ourselves that question though so just glad we did it right.

This treachery has actually even helped us more than hindered us by buying us an extra round, in which to prepare (during a weak questing round), more often than putting insurmountable (spelling) extra cards into the staging area.

Do not raise threat. Do get extra round with Northern Tracker questing.

Ah! So "end the quest phase" means that you stop it right there and continue with the travel phase? So you do not raise any threat at all (which could be very cruel) and "after not successful questing"-effects do happen, right?

How do you know?

 

If it is true, this treachure is good to players, not bad.

It can be good for you if you are going to lose the questing phase.  If you are going to win it, especially in a multi-player game, this just means more locations and enemies get added to the staging area without giving you progress on the quest.  It wastes your turn, essentially.

Hi,

 

my question is: "end the quest phase without resolving the quest" - the non-resolution of the quest, does it mean that you keep the menace of the enemy in the menace-counter for the next turn?

Say, you are at menace 20 when "False Lead" is revelead. In the next turn during the preparation phase, you reveal the cards from the encounter deck and add them to the staging area. 20 menace were already there, now you add 20 (the cards already there whose menace you count again) + the menace from the new cards revealed, say 9. So you end up with 49 menace you have to resolve in questing. 

 

Yesterday we played it like that - and lost.

 

I wonder if we did wrong? However, it doesn't seem that clear to me what non-resolution of the quest implies.

You would not "save" the threat for the following round.  Threat is freshly calculated in each staging phase.

 

What the non-resolution of the quest implies is that you don't do anything that would result from a resolution -- placing progress from questing successfully, or raising threat from questing unsuccessfully.

Also, Escort from Edoras would not get discarded :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

If your staging area is empty, it's kinda of a freebe, and during this quest, it can be quite welcome.

If you've already revealed the plot and you're racing against time to finish the scenario, it's usually a pretty bad card to get.
