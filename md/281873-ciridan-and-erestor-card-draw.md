If I have both ciridan and erestor, how do I draw cards? I know that I will be drawing five cards every round, and that ciridan demands that one be discarded, but how do I choose which one that is? Do I declare that I first draw cards from erestor, and then from ciridan, choosing between the fourth and fifth to discard one, or do I choose a ciridan discard card from all cards I drew, saying that all the bonus card draw resolves at onwe, and that I don’t know which were drawn due to ciridan? The second one seems kind of OP, so I’m leaning towards the first scenario, but I may be wrong. Thanks in advance for the help.

Cirdan and Erestor both have a passive effect that alters the number of cards drawn at the beginning of the resource phase.  So you would draw five cards.  Then Cirdan's forced effect would kick in, and you would have to discard one of the five cards you drew.

Ok, thanks. And I assume this means any of the five cards, correct?

Even better if you play with Lore Bilbo hero, makes you draw 6 cards.

I've been meaning to give that lineup a try forever, I just haven't had a chance to yet. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Have Galdor (ally) out and draw another card as soon as you discard one.

Or just Wait the end of round to draw  it and skip erestor forced descard effect which already took place, of giù prefer
