Hi guys,

I play the german lotr-lcg and I have problems understanding the "song-cards".

 

In german the cards say, you can add the ressource-icon of a specific sphere to the attached hero.

 

What if I attached a green song to a green-sphere-hero? Does he generate 2 ressources now or does the song just add one green ressource to an attached non-green-sphere-hero?

 

Thanks alot!

Still just one the resource.

 

The song cards, that give the attached hero the sphere icon of the card, don't give extra resources they allow the attached hero to spend resources on the attached songs sphere as well as their own.

 

i.e. Attaching a green song to a blue Hero would allow the blue hero's resources to be spent on blue or green cards, not just blue.

As a small side comment, songs are not limited to the attachments that give resource icons:

These all pair well with

Especially if you can convince your co-players to include some of the songs as well.

I keep wanting to build a deck that uses love of tales & the other song cards... just haven't managed to come of with a plan for a deck that makes sense to me to use. Happy to see another song card in lastest adventure pack... i solo most often

Thank you! I guess it was the last time i shuffled these songs into my deck ;D

One last question: If I had lets say 3 green heroes, can I still play 0-cost red cards?

Works best with a partner or two.

Wouldn´t give it a go in a solo deck, I´ll admit.
