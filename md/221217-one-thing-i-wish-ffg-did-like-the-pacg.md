I haven't played the PACG yet, but have seen the boxes and like that the core game is designed to house all of the expansions for that adventure path.  I would really love it if LOTR LCG were set up that way, with each deluxe box having an insert that was made to hold the encounter cards for that entire cycle.  Since the deluxe boxes are generally graced with wonderful art (especially the last two boxes), it would make a great, built in storage solution.  I know it is just a pipe dream, but it is nice to dream....

That box is kind of obnoxious, in my experience. It has slots to hold all the expansion boxes, which is cool. But the slots for all the other decks are too loose early on and cards slide all over the place if you take the game anywhere.

Even sleeved?

Especially sleeved. Rubber bands or Go7 (or other; I get that particular brand direct from the maker cheaply) inserts are the safest way to organise the Pathfinder card games and not have a total mess. The core boxes are more designed to hold the small expansion packs than stacks of cards, and even then they don't hold them well if you move the box around.

Hoping FFG provides a decent insert for any game is likely a pipe dream, indeed.

I'd rather have them put the effort into the game itself. I can figure out ways to store my cards.

Fair enough

I don't think that people who manage the in-box storage solution are capable of putting more work into the game itself, and vice-versa.
