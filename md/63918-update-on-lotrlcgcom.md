The site [http://lotrlcg.com] has been in a hiatus for the last few months, but that is about to change. I have been very busy with school this spring, and I have been looking forward to working on the site again.

I am working on a redesign that that will give you the ability to rate and comment on cards. I am also going to add a card entry system to make adding new cards easier (I currently use the interface on phpMyAdmin, which is very tedious). I'm very open to any other suggestions for features.  

Since I'm doing an overhaul, I'm looking for some graphic design help. As you can see, the layout is pretty bare bones. If you would like to help with coming up with a new layout, send me an email at lotrlcg.com. 

Hopefully I will be done soon!

Great to hear, man!

I still to this day always go to LotRLCG.com first every time before I go to cardgamedb through your link to there lol. And even then it's only if the card isn't on your site, though that number was getting up there.

Very cool.

Please keep it bare bones gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif] It's fast and practical, no unnescessary animations or designs - I like it!

I'd agree.

Keep it easy and simple. Your search-function rocks.
