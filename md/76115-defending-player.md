I had a situation while playing TWITW. I was had an enemy engaged with player 1 but player 2 was defending with a sentinel character. Then a shadow card said that the defending player must discard 2 resources, so who was the defending player? Was player 1 with whom the enemy was engaged or player 2 that was using sentinel to defend?
