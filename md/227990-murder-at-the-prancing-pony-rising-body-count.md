Hi Folks,

 

some days ago i played "Murder at the Prancing Pony" with 3 friends. After getting into Stage 3 we had a situation where i got attacked by the suspect enemies and Bill Ferny's House was in the victory display:

 

> While Bill Ferny's House is in the victory display, each Suspect, and each shadow card dealt to a Suspect, is immune to player card effects.

 

One of them has the shadow card "Rising Body Count" while a character was destroyed by the attack:

 

> Shadow: If this attack destroys a character, either raise your threat by 2, or shuffle Rising Body Count into the Investigation deck.

 

Question .. is it possible to shuffle Rising Body Count into the Investigation deck and not raise my thread by 2?

If I recall correctly, something instructs the players to not resolve the Investigate keyword after you've made the accusation, but I do not believe the Investigate deck is removed from the game.  I believe you can shuffle Rising Body Count into the Investigate deck, unless there is some rule I am overlooking.

Also, Rising Body Count is not a player card, and therefore Bill's house doesn't grant it immunity to its own effects.

Rules state, that you just reveal and add the set aside hideout and suspect cards to the staging area. Investigation deck does not leave play, you just don't investigate anymore like cmabr002 said and can shuffle rising body count in.

 

 

Played the quest myself yesterday and stage 2B says: "After the players quest unsuccessfully, choose 1 random card from the Investigation deck and remove it from the game (without looking at it)".

The rules for making the accusation state, if my accusation was wrong, I have to search the Investigation deck for each just named hideout/suspect that is not already in play and add it to the staging area. If I named one that got removed by the effect on stage 2B I don't add it to the staging area, right? (I just search the Investigation deck, to which the Card no longer belongs as it got removed from the game entirely)

That brings up a way to break the quest, which means it should probably be house ruled or errata'd. If you can afford to quest unsuccessfully at stage 2B ten times in a row, then you can safely name just about any suspect and hideout: since they've been removed from the game, they won't be added to the staging area, and stage 3 would be trivial.

 

To avoid breaking the quest like that, I think I would house rule that when you name a suspect or hideout unsuccessfully, you bring him into the staging area from wherever he is, even out of play. And change stage 2B to say "set aside, out of play" instead of "remove it from the game".
