Hi everyone,

 

I try to respond to the question : When Sleeping sentry is revealed at set up  :

 

Does the effect is not appliable because there's no characters which are exhausted ? So no damage can be dealt, so the first effect is unsuccesfull, so the second effect is not applied like the FAQ says ??

 

 

Or do we must consider that the first effect applies on zero characters, does 1 damage to none but is even succesfull, so that the second effect is applied and All Heroes must exhaust ?

 

I have difficulty to believe that the first effect is a success. But my buddies disagree !

"All" can be "0", see https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/108063-return-to-mirkwood-nightmare-forced-question/?p=1116411 [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/108063-return-to-mirkwood-nightmare-forced-question/page-2#entry1115712]

So the effect is successful, even if no character were damaged.

 

I don't want to translate all I've said before in english, so I know this would not convince you. But hey, I'm trying...

Yeah, you still have to do the second effect.

Isn't there some weird doesn't-really-make-sense distinction between All and Each in this game?
