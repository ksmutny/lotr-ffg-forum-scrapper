Had an interesting game of Dol Guldur, absolutely smashed the quest after struggling on stage 1 for a long time, eventually amassed a small army with each deck and also lowered threat many times (including Loragorns reset). Got enough progress tokens on stage 2 in two turns (and cleared the staging area each turn), smashed the nazgul without any trouble BUT had lost one of the three objectives on stage 1 of the quest from the Nasty Jailor enemy coming out the one turn I quested unsuccessfully early on.... then had to stay on stage 2 for a fair while to wait for the shadow key to come back out (I was very close to the end of the encounter deck and it had come out as a shadow card shortly after it was shuffled back into the deck on stage 1 so was in the discard....).
Totally thought I would threat out or lose before the shadow key reared its head but somehow it luckily came out about 6 turns into the reshuffle of the encounter deck. Due to my many attachments and allies out however cause of how long this game had run I easily wiped any enemies and locations the turn they came out.
Instantly progressed to stage 3 when the shadow key did come back and got ready to crush the last stage. Hilariously the Nazgul came back out during staging on the last turn, had I not easily quested to victory I could have easily crushed him a second time anyway.

 

Anyway, the main thing was, I did fantastically (possibly better than ever before) on this playthrough and could have utterly killed it if it had not been for losing one of the objectives. How nasty that effect really is sunk in during this playthrough, doing this well only to lose cause of one objective being missing would have been devastating.

I had two interesting games of Encounter at Amon Din.  I LOST.  Yeah, amazing......Usually it's such an easy quest.  However, in both games I had multiple Burning Farmhouses out at one time.   They are 5 progress each and as I was trying to clear one burning farmhouse, the others kept burning and burning.( At the end of the round they take 1 token from Saved Villagers and Put on on the Dead Villagers.)  You might say "why not just quest really fast and get rid of them?" Well I had a hard time questing because I had 2-3 enemies engaged with me at the same time.  It was a solo game and I was questing pretty good each round(5-8 will), but I was also defending 2-3 enemies each round, and by the time I could attack back, all my people were exhausted so I couldn't kill them!  Surprisingly, I was still able to make it to 2B but then Gulhat came and finished me off.  It was crazy...... I've played that quest quite a few times and never had anything so nightmarish as that.

PsychoRocka,

 

Congrats! How long have you been trying to defeat that scenario? I've only given it a half dozen or so tries solo single-handed with Core set cards only and never made it past Stage 1, even in "easy" mode. But that may just say something about me as a relative noob?

 

Would it be safe to assume that you played this two-handed, and that you did not limit yourself to Core set cards? Just curious… 'cause if you did win solo single-handed, I'd love to see what your deck was!

Hey TwiceBornh!

I've actually beat it a few times before but just thought this playthrough was particularly interesting.

Honestly its because your using purely core cards and playing Solo, that is insanely difficult and will take you a LONG LONG time to beat. I play Two Handed and have all cards currently released. Sorry I can't help you beat it with just core set cards!

I definitely suggest you at least give two handed a go (even with just the core cards) as only having 1 of 6 heroes held prisoner rather than 1 of 3 really helps alot with this quest and may get you the win after (hopefully) a handful of attempts!

Here are the two decks I used by the way:

Thanks for the suggestions, PsychoRocka. Yes, I am well aware that I am handicapping myself needlessly by not only playing solo single-handed, but sticking to Core only (for the moment). What can I say, I'm a bit of a determined, slow-learning masochist… :-)

 

I expect that it'll be much more fun/winnable with 2 players/hands… and that even then, I may eventually need to relent on my current "Core only" position to beat the scenario.
