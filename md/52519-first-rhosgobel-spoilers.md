Obviously Rhosgobel has reached the first stores by now. Anyway not a big deal as FGG had spoiled 7 out of 10 player/hero cards anyway.

I did not play this scenario yet but it is BRUTAL. It will probably destroy my Eowina-Theodred-Gimli team.

It is using Orcs set, so necromancer damage event is here, Dol guldur orcs are here.

It has 10 NEW cards which are similar to necromancer (damaging all characters in the game based on some conditions). Making it worse, those cards have shadow effects which is also very damaging. I guess without serious healing capabilities, it will be very hard to complete this scenario.

To make things worse, all enemies in this scenario can't be blocked or attacked, unless you are using eagles / ranged characters.

Brutal is good!!!! We need some difficult quests specially when we get so many strong player cards with 3 Adv  packs...

Can you be more specific about encounter cards?????

I know already difficult is 6 and Dol-guldor orcs and spider of Mirkwood sets there also.

Treachery 1 - deal 2 damage to each exhausted character. Shadow - deal 1 to each exhausted. 4 copies

Treachery 2 - deal 1 damage to each character with no attachment. Shadow - character which is most damaged, gets another 3 hits. 4 copies

Treachery 3 - deal 2 damage to each damaged character. Shadow - deal 1 to each damaged or 2 if not defended. 2 copies

I like this. Makes Glorfindel a good competitor to Éowyn. The lower Willpower could be easily balanced out by higher Hit Points and the healing ability.
