 Elf friend is a very thematic card, love it. All the cards seem good and boost a lot the Noldor train. Also nice to see Galdor ally

Silver harp and Call for Aid are awesome.

Does Call for Aid let you see your top 10 cards and dont reshuffle if you choose not to put an ally in play?

Good question, I guess you still will have to shuffle but it is not clear

Galdor + ally Erestor seems like a fun combination. Discard one card to draw two.

Reinforcements is nice, like a double Sneak Attack shared among the players.

I note that Send for Aid actually costs a resource to play, unlike the other side-quests. And it has 6 quest points. It's still ridiculously good. (And no, GandalfDK, I'm pretty sure "Each player who did so" refers to the whole thing of searching the top 10 cards. Also I'm pretty sure there's a ruling somewhere that after looking at any number of cards in a player or encounter deck, you shuffle it unless the card effect in question tells you not to)

Silver Harp looks like it'll be very nice in its own niche as well.

Ha, designers covered that base already. FAQ 1.21 says, Whenever a player searches through a deck, that player shuffles the deck after searching it unless a card effect says otherwise. Sorry! (Send for Aid's second sentence is still necessary, though, as not every player necessarily searched their deck.)

So, the discarding playstyle seems to be sticking to Spirit-Lore exclusively.

Silver harp and Galadhrim weaver make the discard mechanism far more viable I guess. You can save at least one card per turn from the discard mechanism of erestor. Not to mention that if you have Cirdan with the harp, you draw two cards per turn and keep them both

...can I change my answer for my own "Strongest player card adventure pack" thread? ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

 

Seriously, this crop of player cards is phenomenal. Maybe not for frank power, but for revealing the possibilities of the Noldor archetype with a bang, with 4/10 cards directly interacting with the discard pile. Elf-friend by itself would be game-changing (who wants to stick a couple Bows of the Galadhrim on Bard the Bowman?). Heckuva player side quest, a sort of double Sneak Attack, cancellation victory display shenanigans... Can't wait to explore new deckbuilding avenues here.

> So, the discarding playstyle seems to be sticking to Spirit-Lore exclusively.

 I guess it has to be associated with Lore, while Spirit has seen it's share of discarding effects (with Rohan and Noldor traits).

Eowyn + Elf Friend + Herugrim + Fair and Perilous = Tons of Damage :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] Let's also throw in Lay of Nimrodel and stuff.

 

I like how all those discarding mechanic cards are simply pretty useful on their own, without requiring some special stuff to be built around them.

> Galdor + ally Erestor seems like a fun combination. Discard one card to draw two.

 

This got me thinking about a timing question on a slightly different combo: hero Erestor's discard effect happens at the end of the round. Galdor's Response has "Limit once per round."

 

Let's say it's the end of round 2. You trigger Galdor from Erestor's passive effect. Is Galdor's effect still happening during round 2? I say yes, although it seems a little odd that something can happen after something that triggers at the end of round, in the very same round... But I guess Responses mess with natural game structure all the time, no?

 

(This is relevant if you wanted to trigger Galdor earlier in round 3 than the end of the round again.)

Really, so many good ones. Horn's Cry is perfect for hero Beorn, don't you say?

And the Noldor mechanic, the Harp, Galdor, both great boosts.

Reinforcements and Call for Aid make for more core Gandalf "abuse" strategy. Mono-Leadership Gondor, oh yes, now much better!

Very interesting pack: I'm not sure all of those will live up to the expectations, but there are at least some that look incredibily powerful.

Send for Aid is incredibile, especially in 3-4p games.

I like the pack overall. Many good cards for the discard mechanic. I'm not sure how I feel about Elf-Friend. Thematically it's nice, but I feel like in practice it's just going to lead to broken and/or unthematic combos. Eowyn decks are going to be running Light of Valinor and then use Fair and Perilous for attack. I do see the point of it allowing e.g. Aragorn to equip Lorien cloaks.

Elf-friend will probably not work well in certain combos (and it will require more attachments and other cards to work well), but I think that it will work amazingly with some heroes, maybe in tactics, where heroes will be allowed to quest with Light of Valanor. Could also work well with hobbits.

It will possibly be a blast for solo play!

It probably won't be worth the combo, but now Brand and Bard can finally get some nice weapon attachments.  Also now there is in sphere access for Eomer to get ranged via Rivendell Bow.  Eomer can attack ranged and use Firefoot to trample an enemy engaged with him.

Silver Harp and Elrond's Council equals threat dial spinning backwards.

This is a paradigm changing pack in many ways.

Are you sure playing a card = discarding it from your hand? I'm not sure it does.

 

But I am really excited about the harp for another reason: It allows an Erestor deck to keep stuff like Test of Will in hand turn after turn until it's needed. The harp makes the deck type much more friendly to solo play in my opinion.

I'm sure that Silver Harp is meant to return a card that is discarded via a card effect such as Protector of Lorien... not to "return any event, ever."  Kind of like how a destroyed character is 'placed in the discard pile' rather than 'discarded' (and thus the new Gamling ally cannot key off of chump blocking).  If you play an event, it gets discarded but this is not the same as discarding from your hand.

Galadriel + Mirror + Silver harp = Best tutor of the game ... If you add Galdor ... It's so powerfull !!!!!

 

Daeron's Rune + Silver harpe = Two cards ... with Galdor, Three cards ....

 

Silver harp is abused ... With Cirdan ... So abused

I like how the cards in this pack look really powerful but not in an obvious, auto-included way. They need a specific strategy or combo to become great cards.

Elf-friend is great for spirit decks wanting to eschew noldor characters but sill get the benefits of some great spirit noldor/silvan characters. 

 

Light of the Valinor comes to mind. Light of the valinor on Eowyn, with herugrim, why not?

 

Or tactics, which tactics character doesn't want some lovely Rivendell blades? Eomer, firefoot and rivendell blade. Merry with Rivendell blade and Dagger of Westernesse.

 

I wonder what sort of silly attachment combos you can get with hobbits + nor am I a stranger + elf-friend.

Yes, sure. Though one may be easily tempted to use during the round, not just at its end. Well, you can use it during the round, then at its end too because Harp will be ready, just not during the next round then.

Yep, and it's not unique so you could could have a whole bunch in play I suppose. Pretty powerful.

 

I also appreciate how well the Galdor and Erestor allies work together.

My mind is going nuts thinking about the combos and synergy of Elf-friend. As already said in this thread, Eowyn can swing for tons of damage with equipping Herugrim and using Fair and Perilous once she's a friend of the Elves. But then I realize, "Spirit swinging for 9!?

True, not unique, and not limited to 1 per character, just restricted. For some fun, just imagine Círdan playing two harps at once (he might wanna watch out for the beard though).

And yes, Galdor combos with both versions of Erestor -- how cool.

It is quite surprising that Elf-friend is Leadership, the one sphere associated least with either Noldor or Silvan, I would say (in terms of cards featuring the trait I mean).

Epic player side quest!!! Going straight in my decks even with its cost of 1 instead of 0. Also this is easily my favourite valour card so far, could be SO POWERFUL during a round in which plenty of combat takes place. I love that the non valour affects all enemies but the valour affects only enemies engaged with one player. So so good for people who play with two decks where one is the "combat" deck and one is the "questing/support" deck especially considering the combat deck usually has higher starting threat and less threat reduction. All the noldor cards are really nice and so is Elf-Friend, trying to think of something cool that has not already been suggested with it... hmmmm. Not a very exciting one but no one has mentioned Elven Mail, you can give an extra two hit points and sentinel to other defenders now via the mail. Awesome pack for player cards and the quest looks really cool as well. I don't know how much of a fan I am of fighting Thaurdir again in the exact same card form. He is literally the exact same boss from Deadmen's Dike, when we fought Bellach twice we at least got different versions of him with different art.... this time its the same art and exact same card. We already get that a fair bit these days with objective allies (Nalir identical in multiple quests in ring maker cycle, Iarion in two quests of Lost realm which is not as bad however at least it is in the one box and now same version of Amarthiul in Wastes, Across the Ettenmoors AND now Treachery of Rhudaur), do we really want/need this to happen with bosses as well....?

The good thing about Amarthiul is that with his very nice 3 attack and defense and ability to swap control when you need it most (when enemies engage) he allows the developers to make enemies tougher, more frequent and more daunting as you essentially have an extra combat oriented hero (minus the resources) for the whole quest.

This may be the most powerful pack for deck augmenting ever. Effectively 9 sneak attacks with the book and reinforcements now. Elf Friend, Insane card draw. A free protector of lorein but for attack. Unbelieveable. All the side quests were amazing but tactics drew the shortest straw there. The other side quests were much better.

Most of all this really makes that 'out of the wild' deck come full circle. Find that nasty enemy or treachery on an early turn. Then negate it throughout the game. Lore is nearing mastery of complete encounter deck control. Stay in secrecy then risk some light then expect mischief, counsel, cancel victory duplicates. Asfoloth those meager locations. Lore can negate so mamy encounter cards. I'm a firm believer that a clean staging area is a path to victory

Oh, that happened to me before: confusing a Neutral card for a Leadership one. It also makes sense as far as the distribution goes. And then, of course, the card is much, much better than I had thought it be. What an update from Nor am I a Stranger: instead of Rohan in Spirit you get both Noldor and Silvan in neutral. Now I share the excitement fully.

> An Outlands-friend.

There is the Sword of Morthond but only for Gondor allies. Still, all the bonuses are for Outlands you control, so this wouldn't work across the table as, for instance, the Rohirrim bonuses do.

Sadly, you can't play Nor am I stranger on someone then play mutual accord to let anyone have the Sword of Morthond. That would be amazing.

 

Incidentally there are a lot of good gondor allies you can attach the sword to, then sword thain them for heroness, elf-friend them and then you have an outlands/gondor/elf hero, all the best buffs except for dwarf.

Yes, you can do some shenanigans with the Thain and all the trait giving stuff we now have.

I gave up on Outlands long ago -- for being too straightforward to play. The combo of the Sword on Denethor is one thing I was enjoying the most about playing such a deck, because I always found the Denethor ally too underwhelming -- not saying the card is bad, it actually works for me in the Gondor deck quite often, but such an iconic character should get some bonus -- look how interesting the Galdor ally is, for instance; even Ingold seems better than Denethor ally most of the time.

I'm really looking forward to the last pieces of the Noldor/discard strategy that this cycle will bring.

In the next Adventure pack, The Battle of Carn Dûm, "Spirit players gain a Noldor-themed card that plays only from the discard pile."

 

 

And in the last Adventure pack of this cycle, The Dread Realm, we get "a spirit Song that recalls the lay of Beren and Lúthien to encourage stronger alliances between the region's Dúnedain and Noldor."

 

Probably the Song "Tale of Tinúviel" that we got a glimpse of in the preview article for Wastes of Eriador:

I initially thought, the card that only plays from the discard pile will be the Tale of Tinúviel but of course that is the one recalling Beren and Lúthien.

I find the strategy already very strong after this pack (considering Círdan also), and we still have two more and the next deluxe. Noldor are going out to town.

Of courage he wasn't, as Númenor is raised from the sea in the Second Age and Beren died before the First Age was over. But the Dúnedain descend from Beren and Lúthien, and that's what this upcoming card is about.

I guess I'm the dissenting voice here.   I looked at a lot of it and felt "eh..".  I don't think this is even close to best pack ev-ar.    Elf-friend is I think being way overrated.  I mean sure,  theorycrafting we can think of nice ways this would work.  But are you really going to include 3 elf friend in your deck so that you can pay 1 for the privilege of playing cards that you have in your deck which you otherwise can't play?   It seems like bad deck building to me.  Eowyn could already have Snowmane and Herugrim, for practically the same setup as the suggested LoV+Herugrim.   No access to Fair and Perilous for the icing on the cake but she can do it without having to have Elf-Friend first, and even saves a resource in the bargain.   The very best I can see for this card is if I am already running an elf deck with Silvan Trackers,  I can play Elf-Friend on another player's heros to allow them to benefit from free healing.  That's pretty nice,  and perhaps I can pawn off some of my extra elf-only equipment on my allies if I have extras.   So sure, in a deck that is already Silvan maybe,   in a non-silvan deck just to get access to combos?  Forget it.

Elven Spear is kind of a dud.   There are just way better ways to get attack out of tactics than this.  

Galadrhim Weaver a huge dissapoint.   Can't attack or defend?   What is this nonsense?   Why not just make this card an event?   I can already fetch stuff out of my discard pile with Stand and Fight, or Tome.  Why do I want to put a card back in my deck when I *might* draw it again and it *might* be useful.  

Galdor is pretty good.   Expensive,  but pretty good.
Horn's cry;   Goes in a Valor deck.  I can't justify the cost unless you are using it's valor action, and even then, only if there are several enemies engaged.

Reinforcements:  Sure it's good but I'll probably never play it.   It's good for mono-leadership or pseudo-mono-leadership (with gandalf or Song or Sword that was Broken).   Otherwise you can't play it.   Goes in one type of deck.   Good, but not versatile enough.

Send for Aid:   Best card in the pack.  Probably will buy for this.

Silver Harp:  Great for discard shenans.   A pretty good include most of the time.  It's pretty good with Steed of Imladris.   I might be putting Silver harp and Steed of Imladris in my rohan deck.

The Door is Closed:   Like reinforcements;  if you're running that kind of deck... then oh man is this card nutso.   But not versatile.  



So all in all,  one great card,  2 good cards,  the rest are either situational or kind of unimpressive, IMO.

With regards to elf-friend. It's cheap, it's neutral, can be fetched by a myriad of cards easily. Noldor and Silvan have some of the best attachments in the game that you can now attach to non-elf heroes. Picture bard with bow of the galadrim, rivendale bow and blade in multiplayer. 6 attack with -4 defense. Attachment combos were easy to pull off before, that isn't changing because of elf-friend, it just allows for new ones.

 

> Elven Spear is kind of a dud.   There are just way better ways to get attack out of tactics than this.  

 

Fuels the Noldor strategy, cheap card, combos off of harp and Galdor effectively saying; Gain +1 attack and draw a card every turn. Still going to be plenty useful.

Not the first time we've had a card like this, Erebor record keeper was the same. Though this is basically an event that gives you one extra will power and an extra archery target in a pinch and is an ally. So can key of things like shadows or travel that require exhaustion and A very good tale. Much better than a tome that's for sure.

 

Also if you are playing with say Cirdan or Erestor you will be drawing that card again, likely sooner than you think.

I feel you are forgetting "A good harvest" to basically put this card in any deck. 3x sneak attack, 3x this card with just one gandalf can have you recycle his response 7 times.

Galadrhim Weaver is solid.  Not just in the Noldor discard decks, but remember this is a 1-cost Silvan ally that you can use for things like Tree People and Feigned Voices (and doesn't get discarded easily like the Silvan Refugee).

 

Plus she fits into the someday-might-exist-and-would-probably-be-terrible craftsmen deck!

Um, yes you can. That's an entirely legal play if you want to do it.

 

That second idea of yours wouldn't entirely work though - Sword of Morthond specifies 'ally', so if you Sword-Thain them they lose the Outlands trait. You could have an Outlands/Gondor/Noldor/Silvan ally though.

No it's not, there is no action phase during the planning phase.

 

Edit: Though you could in multiplayer I guess, since there is player actions after each players phase. So if you really want to set up multiple decks just to do that then sure. One deck has to have mutual accord, the next deck to go in turn order has the sword.

 

The sword says attach to an ally, so the sword doesn't get unattached when they become a hero. Though I'm not too sure about the second line.

Hmm, guess I should read errata more. Was going off the phases in the back of the book which has an action phase after each player has played things. So in solo there was no window for actions. Guess it made some strategies easier than I thought.

A stupid cold stopped me of seeing these cards yesterday, but now that I see them I'll say I share the general feelings towards this pack. Really cool and interesting cards, particularly the ones dealing with Elves. The Harp and Galdor look really really powerful. One card I'm still rather ambivalent towards is Reinforcements. Sure, double Sneak Attack is powerful, but mono-Leadership builds, particularly Gondor, rely more on large numbers of weenies rather than powerful allies, so putting into play 2 allies only to then return them to hand is not really interesting. With Gandalf it works great of course, like Sneak Attack, but I'd much rather play Sneak Attack with Gandalf and actually paying the normal cost of a weenie, rather than paying extra resources to put a Guard of the Citadel or Envoy of Pelargir into play for one turn. Send for Aid, on the other hand, seems really good, especially to fetch Faramir or other big allies.

I'm trying to see where the breakdown was so I could maybe help... not sure though.  Are you thinking that you can only use Actions during your own turn?  Those green boxes in the back of the book (which you refer to) mean that *any player* can take Actions, you don't have to wait for your own turn.  There isn't errata for this, the back of the book hasn't changed since release.

 

Players do have to go in turn-order when playing attachments and allies, but you can use an Action on something already in play, or from an Event card, even if it's not your turn.

 

In solo you could play Nor Am I A Stranger (playing attachment), then play Mutual Accord (an Event with an Action on it), then play Sword of Morthrond (another attachment).  No problem.  

 

In multiplayer on your turn you could play Nor Am I A Stranger (attachment), then anyone could play Mutual Accord (doesn't matter whose turn it is), then you could play Sword of Morthrond on the newly "Gondored" ally.

The book has 'player actions' right after the section of 'first player plays ally and attachment cards' which I realise now is rather redundant. That is where I'm getting the confusion. It's fine though I can see where I could play the cards now, I was just putting a really self imposed restriction on planning phases during my solo games because of our groups reading of the book. It's cool though, thanks for pointing it out.

 

Back to cool things about this set:

Going to swap to the encounter cards. I like how the side quests have basis in the some of the main parts of the game, resources, combat and locations. Makes taking on this quest highly replayable from choosing to do different sidequests dependent on the deck you bring.

Since Sword of Morthond says "Attached ally gains the Outlands trait", it will stop working (although will not be discarded) if you attach Sword Thain to the ally.

Did you miss that Reinforcements says "The players, as a group"? The powerful allies don't need to be in your hand, they can be in anyone's hand. And they can enter play under any player's control as well.

 

Also, since I guess we're talking about this, best target for Sword of Morthond is White Tower Watchman.

There are many combos with the Harp, but to me the most powerful is in an Erestor deck where you play (or discard) all but one card in your hand. Now you can save that Test of Will of Hasty Stroke (or any other response) until you actually need it. That essentialy fixes the single biggest weakness of the Noldor "draw your deck, but put it into your discard pile afterwards" strategy. It's not as if there is a danger of failing to draw the Harp to begin with, when you are drawing so many cards per turn. Between the Harp, Galdor, the Weaver, and whatever comes in the next two packs to play from the discard pile, my Revenge of the Nerds deck is going to be out of control. Once we get Cirdan it will truly accelerate to ludicrous speed. I am very excited to see just how silly I can make this deck.

That's a good point, but this gives you the flexibility to either have 4 or 5 willpower. If you skip giving her the bonus willpower, you'll have it around to prevent other cards from being discarded. I think you're largely correct, though, that you might as well us FotL.

The Door is Closed makes it hard to whiff on an Out of the Wilds.  It might be worth taking a nasty Treachery and shutting it down for the game.

Also good with Protectior of Lorien. This card seems to be one of the new power cards of the game.

Yea. I may be wrong but I think someone already mentioned Protector of Lorien. Still a good one because it's even more versatile than just gaining willpower. But Eowyn and Galadriel are in sphere so it's easier to use with them.

This one thing bugging me here. It's the cost of the Harp. I'm feeling like, in most of sutuations, harp is gonna lose the duel for the right to be played the turn you have those 2 resources and an alternative to Harp with the immdiate game presence.

All I know is that it shouldn't cost only 1. If you made it unique, then MAYBE 1 would be fine, otherwise 2 seems fine to me. I agree that 2 makes it more difficult to play, but it shouldn't be too easy either.

I think the cost is appropriate.  1 cost would put it in the "power card" range where you'd start including it in most spirit decks.  At 2 cost, it's only really worth it in specific decks.

Exciting pack. Lot's of cards that invite you to make a deck around them! It's funny how Noldor just suddenly became a full-fledged archetype in such a short time. Sure the tactics allies where here a long time ago, but now everything flows together.

The clue objectives are on the back of the side quests. You flip them over and they become clues. That's my guess anyway looking at the side quest cards.

Though I tend to agree, especially with the arrival of Cirdan, I believe that we should get a Noldor Leadership and a Noldor Tactics Hero, since there are only two, who mostly restrict the player to use them both in order for them to be effective.

That would be nice! We are due a Leadership hero but the next pack is going to have a Dunedain hero they said... maybe in the Saga boxes!?

I don't see where in the next 2 saga boxes you would include a Leadership Noldor, I think it's fairly possible there is one in the Grey Havens.

Since Galdor appears as a Lore ally, it is possible that in Grey Havens we will get a Hero version of him, most probably leadership

It would be cool to see the elf brothers in Saga Expansion 5, but then again there are so many heroes that will probably take precedence - Spirit Aragorn is my bet there. New Elladan and Elrohir could tie in nicely with the discard mechanic. If they're Spirit and Lore they could focus on questing/cancellation and healing or scrying. Maybe the Lore one could have: "Action: Discard a card from your hand to heal 1 damage from a character. (limit once per round.)" Not sure if it's balanced, but it would encourage having their father in play for the bonus.

If you're discarding most of your cards, you probably have resources to spare for their abilities.

I don't see how the appearance of a Fellowship Aragorn in Treason of Saruman affects the chance of a Spirit version in another release.

Yes, I think some kind of buff is likely! We've seen the Strider side of him in the other spheres, so a more "royal", synergic Aragorn would be cool.

Oh yeah. And it's true that sometimes they include a new hero that is, right away, forbidden to play, like Grima, who you can't play in the first quest of his own expansion!  (Excuse my writing if it's unclear, I'm french-canadian)

I really think they torpedoed Spirit Aragorn with Loragorn.  Threat reducing is a Spirit ability and yet they made Loragorn the single strongest threat reducer in the game.  I guess in trade they need to allow Spiragorn to draw cards.

I know there are a lot more named elves that Dunedain in the lore, but here are the Nolder and Dunedain we have so far:

 

Noldor

Erestor

Elrond

Galadriel

Glorfindel (x2)

Elrohir

Elladan

Cirdan is coming

and we could argue that Legolas and Celeborn could be included.

 

Dunedain

Aragorn (x3)

Beravor

Idraen

Halbarad

 

My point is only that we need more Dunedain to balance things out.

I think the only reason that a Spirit Aragorn is unlikely in the 5th box is that if the 6th box follows Sam and Frodo, and the 5th focuses on Minas Tirith etc., then the Palantir of Orthanc would be a useless Boon as it must attach to a Fellowship Aragorn. And it is only gained in the last quest of Treason of Saruman - if we get an alternative Fellowship hero and can choose to include Aragorn, that's great, but otherwise it would mean that Boon cannot be used at all after gaining it.

> I don't see how the appearance of a Fellowship Aragorn in Treason of Saruman affects the chance of a Spirit version in another release.

Because obviously we're going to get another one in the box you suggested, because that will be following Aragorn's side of the story just as ToS was. I mean, the box is even named 'Flame of the West', how much more obvious do you need it to be that the Fellowship hero will be Aragorn again?

I didn't know about the name, nor have I played campaign mode and got into how boons and burdens work. (I'm probably in the minority here, but I'm usually much more excited about cycle packs than saga expansions.) You may well be right.

News: Carn Dum and Land of Shadow are on the boat.

He means we will certainly have a new Fellowship Aragorn, just llike they do for the Frodos. That's I also think we won't see Aragorn Spirit in Saga 5.

I got my copy today and just finished my first run through. The quest is DL5 for the record.

I won my first try, and I don't feel I was particularly lucky. The quest has some fairly nasty shadow effects, but once burning brand is in play you can take most of that away. There are also a few "wrath" effects which are pretty nasty and will make you think twice about the order in which you do things.

The first stage of the quest is ... Weird. Stage 1B is timed 5 with no way to put counters back on. There are no quest points on this stage, you have to make progress on the side quests. But the side quests require 14, 16 & 18 progress. As a solo player it's not easy to finish even one side quest before time runs out. When it remove all side quests from play and move on to stage 2A. It was just weird to me. It will be hard enough to finish one side quest, let along all three.

Love to hear other people experiences. I'll dial it up again soon.

I was able to finish two of the sidequests on my first playthrough solo. I even had one of them buffed with +6 quest points. I think I got lucky there because I cleared locations and enemies the round they came in. The encounter deck couldn't keep up and I steamrolled the final stage of the quest.

 

However, the second game I got location and side quest locked! I threated out before the last time counter was removed... >_>

Don't the special effects on each side quest also help you make progress though? Surely this must help a fair bit?

Played tonight 2-player and won on the first attempt with Bard/Merry/Elrond and Erestor/Legolas/Eowyn.  We cleared two of the three side quests (one of them just barely, it needed 30 progress as it had 2 condition treacheries stacked on it).  Had a rough transition to stage 2 and managed to weather 6 attacks while still clearing about 3 enemies in return.  Then we totally lucked out and had a complete whiff of a questing phase-- 2 whiff treachery cards, 1 of them surged into a harmless location.  One of the treacheries did cause the boss guy to attack, but we were well prepared for it.  That round of love from the encounter deck allowed us to cruise to victory the round afterward, 20 progress on the quest and claiming two of the Clues.

I got very unlucky. I had that side quest that raises your threat each round by 2 so I did my best to get rid of it but I got hammered by locations and treacheries and couldn't make progress quick enough. I also couldn't muster enough Willpower (I had bad draws) so I barely scratched the initial active location. Only did clear two locations that game. And when I did get enough willpower I had the treachery that forces you to choose a new quest... So that threat raising quest stayed in the whole game and I lost by threating out.

The treacheries in this quest are simply nasty.  And there are often penalties for cancelling them.  Much harder than the last two quests.
