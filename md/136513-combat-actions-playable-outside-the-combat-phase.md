Hi,

 

meanwhile we got a couple of effects which let an enemy attack outside the combat phase. 

It is possible to play cards with the Combat Action-keyword like Feint in such attacks?

 

If i read the rules correct, then the answer is no (Page 23):

> Some action triggers are preceded by a specific phase of the game. This type of trigger means that the following action can only be triggered during the specified phase. For example, an effect with the trigger “Quest Action:” can only be triggered during an action window of the quest phase. Actions without a specified phase can be triggered during any action window throughout the round. (See the “Turn Sequence” chart on pages 30-31.) The hero card Glorfindel provides an example of an action that can be used during any player action window. The event card Radagast’s Cunning provides an example of an action that can only be used during the quest phase.

I think you are correct… and that in turn makes me wonder if some of my victories against Shadow and Flame might have been invalid (maybe I used a few Feints to block attacks made by Durin's Bane during the Quest phase, when I shouldn't have)?

 

Argh, another detail potentially missed… this is going to drive me crazy...

Another thing .. if an enemy makes an attack outside the combat phase there is mostly no action window where you could play feint before declaring the enemy as the attacker because the enemy is already declared as the attacker :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Ennemies attacking outside normal windows will open a sub combat sequence that will allow player to play action.

Of course, you can't play a feint when an attack has already started. You're totally right.

But! you can hopefully use some other action, like readying effect or defense boost, that's allowed.

Hey, you write hopefully, so you're not sure?

 

A combat sequence is not equal to combat phase. So i think you can not do any combat actions like 'Dawn take you all' or 'Great Yew Bow' outside the combat phase.

But behind strong walls, and other action-events, would still be a viable option

We got an answer from Caleb. Super hard to find it back (or I'm just being super lazy). You just follow each step of an attack like described in the rulebook, just skipping the "1. choose an enemy".

Ok, that's the answer of how to manage a combat sequence outside the combat phase. But it is not the combat phase for playing cards like "Dawn take you all"??

Oh, that... I would say no from memory.

Right, it's still not the combat phase.  Hence the idea of enemies attacking 'outside of the combat phase.'  It may set up a sequence of events that looks like the combat phase, but we're still not in the combat phase, so no Dawn Take You All.
