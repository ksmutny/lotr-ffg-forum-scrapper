His text says: Forced: When Ravenous Warg attacks , the defending player must declare the character he controls with the most damage as the defender. (Even if exhausted.)

 

The question is: if the most damaged character is exhausted..., does his shield count?

 

Thanks

You know, I have played as if it did not count, but now that I look more closely I guess it would.  Normally you have to exhaust a character to declare them as the defender, but this card forces you to declare someone as a defender even if already exhausted.

 

The only time you don't count the defense value is during an undefended attack.  This attack will by definition be defended, so it looks like their defense value should count.

We have been playing it as if it does count and even taking advantage of it with Beravor

Good point GrandSpleen i'm going to play it this way going forward. I'm sure I've lost at least one hero to a Ravenous Warg by not counting the exhausted hero's shield.

The real question, here, is :

When you have no damaged character, do you have to decide which character with no damage is the most damaged you control ? That would enable you can to pick up an already exhausted hero as defender against the ravenous warg.

I think you can pick any character you want in that situation, since it's an all-way tie.

Yes - I agree with GrandSpleen... your heroes are all equally damaged/undamaged... so you would get to choose.
