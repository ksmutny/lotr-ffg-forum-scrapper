Hi all, I'm new to these forums so excuse me if this has been asked before, but has anyone any idea where I can get a copy of the saga expansion set The Road Darkens in the u.k? I've looked on the upcoming section and it says a reprint is 'On the boat' any idea what this means?!

Hello and welcome!

If you can't find anything online, check a local gaming store. Otherwise, "On the boat" means that the product is shipping from the factory to FFG. Typically this is a four week duration from China to FFG before the product is further distributed. For the UK, I'm not sure if Asmodee makes the process faster (skips the delivery to FFG in Minnesota). I'll have to defer that to someone else.
