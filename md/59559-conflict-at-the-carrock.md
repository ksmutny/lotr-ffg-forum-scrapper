 Quick question:

Are you allowed to use Northern Tracker to explore The Carrock before you get to stage two?

I can't see a reason why not, and by doing so the trolls have one less attack and defense when they come out.

 Oh, it is immune to card effects.  Somehow  I missed that line.

 Question answered.  Thanks.
