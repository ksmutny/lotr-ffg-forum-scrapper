# [Card Storage and Organization](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57499-card-storage-and-organization/)

## 1 [USS Daedalus on December 12, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57499-card-storage-and-organization/?do=findComment&comment=566846)

I just wanted to ask what method everyone uses to store their cards and their organization methods. I currently have been using those 9 card pouches things that fit into binders, but as I have been buying every set I am fast running out of room. Also, it's rather cumbersome to carry around a binder because it doesn't fit into the box.

 

Any ideas?

i have an unused pool table that i keep the game permanently set up on, looks nice if you have the room, cant you get deck boxes (or something similar...never tried them myself)

It's a great question.  So, for the meantime I have turned the cardboard insert over that is in the Core Box Set, to create a two row carrier.  It works quite nicely for the amount of cards I currently have (I have also purchased every set including Osgiliath), but I soon foresee running out of room.  Rather than invest in any other forms of carrying at the moment, I am just going to remove the divider once I have too many cards to fit in the two rows.  In the future I will probably buy or make something more permanent.  I thought about putting the cards in binders, but I realized before doing that how anal that would become when I wanted to build decks and fight certain scenarios, I would have to take all the right cards out of the holders; didn't want to do that.  Hope this helps some!

I made some, imo, neat tuckboxes for LoTR. They fix a good set of card in each box, also they fix nice and neat in the FFG Core set box, leaving a bit of room to allow manuals and other junk to sit on top. They also are wide enough to fit sleeved cards nicely.

A tuck box, is just a pattern you print out, fold, glue and then you have a nice looking box to place your cards in.

There is a box for Lore, Spirit, Leadership and Tactics, as well as one for Neutral and Heroes. Simply download the JPGs or the PDFs and print and fold.

Due to the size of the boxes you need to print on A4 with out any boarders or resizing, so make sure the printer you take it to can "print to the edge". If not, you will need to print on A3.

I hope you like, please comment if you do!

Example - These are basicly what they look like, though the Netural, and Heroes are not here, and also the Leadership one has changed. Also this image was a WIP, they look better now, as well as my final version were printed on better quality card.

Example - This are all the stuff packed away. this represents every player card released to date as well as all the core set encounter cards, chitz and threat counters. Also there is much space curently in the these boxes for more player cards, I am certian that all of Kaz and most of Darowdelf will fit in this one copy of core.

PS - On a side note, the AP packs themselves are perfect for storing the individual encounter cards and their unique rule sheet. They also are big enough to fit sleeved cards. I own 3 core sets, so I store the APs in my second box. The 3rd box is currently unused, though I am keeping it in case I ever need to use it.

 I have two core sets, and all the expansions upto Return to Mirkwood, including Osgiliath.

at the moment, I have 4 decks (generally) one per sphere in colour-coded deck boxes. They fit in a row inside the core-set box, with 4 threat-counters on top

then i have the unused player cards in bundles by sphere, held together with an elastic band- (needs to be slightly loose to not dent the sleeves) in the second row, along with the tokens in bags.

Lastly the quest cards in 4 piles - 1 for core set, 2 for mirkwood cycle quests, and 1 for fan-created - quest cards for Ninjadorg's stuff, plus a fan-made encounter deck for a quest.. something at the barrow downs, forget the exact name.

For now it fits fine, but I'm going to start having issues soon with the number of cards.

## 7 [zeb on December 13, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57499-card-storage-and-organization/?do=findComment&comment=566958)

So far I have used the core box and turned inside out the internal insert. Thus there are two "lanes" to put the cards for all APs.

I use a 700 card box (2 rows) from UltraPro to store unused cards, sorted into spheres and encounter sets. Current decks are stored in plastic deck protector boxes.

You mean sleeved? Well, all my cards are sleeved (using a mixture of FFG sleeves and Mayday premium sleeves) and they fit nicely in the boxes.

Not really, I just took some cardboard I had laying around, measured it to fit inside the original box and taped it together. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] Works really well. You can set up any configuration you want.

I've made a set of dividers from MDF.  This is an older pic, which doesn't include the ribbon card lifters, but you get the idea...

I can try and get some better pictures for you, and some of the actual LotR box. Basically it is made to fit tightly into the original game box. I used packing tape to hold the sections together (look closely at the corners and you can see it). Outside of the box it is flimsy, but inside the box it is kept sturdy by the actual box. The middle sections are not rock solid but they won't fall over or break.

First step is to take 4 pieces of cardboard (the sturdiest you can find) and make a square that fits just inside the original box (try and make it a fairly tight fit). Use the tape to hold the corners together. From there determine what size and shape sections you want, and cut the cardboard into the necessary sections. Use tape at every possible corner (on both sides) to attach all the pieces together. Once you are done you'll have a square of cardboard with sections (no bottom) that is a little flimsy. Just take that and put it in the game box and it should fit snugly. The snug fit will make it fairly sturdy since it will be pushing up against the sides of the box and won't flop around.

I love it. It fits what I wanted to do perfectly, and I can carry around a lot of cards in the original game box, along with all the various tokens and threat counters.

I have been playing with Svenn's method for storing cards, and this is my WIP for Call of Cthuluhu, It is almost finished apart form 2 dividers on the edge there. All these are sleeved btw. Anyway, this represents 1065 cards (so about 1/2 my CoC stuff) That is 3 copies of Core + 10 APs (coc aps are 60 cards exactly)

Anyway, the point is that this is a awesome way to store them I think. It puts all my cards in one spot in a easy to store boxes, and as I have my original Boxes everything is cool.

I'm going to be changing to this method for my LoTR collection. There is one other thing.... A real good way to store your dividers for this method is to take your AP box, unfold it, then cut off all the "tabs" apart form 1. So you end up with the front of the AP box, (with teh name and GFX) and 1 side of the AP box. This creates a card, with a wrap around side that can slot into the cards as a divider, but is readable as the side of the PA box is flat on the cards...

The small cardboard bits in the APs work great to divide the factions as well... I'll update after I get my LoTR box orginised.

 I use a Magic the Gathering Fat Pack box to store my cards.

It is quite nice, sturdy, and can hold all my cards (Core set + Khazad Dum) and still has a little room for browsing. To make it more handy, I added cardboard dividers to separate the different spheres of influence and adventures, and now I can find basically anything almost instantly (although, I will need to get another box if I ever decide to buy more adventure packs). Another advantage of the box is that I it takes up very little space, so my cards became a lot more portable than if I had left them in their original box.

p.s.: You don't have to be a Magic player to get these boxes. Quite a few "nerd stores" sell them both online and offline.

Cool idea with cutting the boxes for dividers, booored! I might just use it... but I'm very attached to my boxes. >_< lol. Also, I mix my sets and would want them marked by sphere. Hmmm....

 You could use the boxes to separate the encounter decks and then box up the player cards.

For Hero/Player cards I use the Ultra Pro Premium Binder as it provides a good overview and easy access to the cards. It has 20 double-sided pages with 9 pockets each (360 pockets total) and each pocket easily fits 3 copies of a card. Currently the LotR cards (including Khazad-dûm) use less than half of the binder. It is available in different colors and costs around 20USD.

For the Quest/Encounter cards I use a large (800) cardbox with selfmade dividers.

Of course not. The whole point of the binders is that you don't need to sleeve the cards.

yea i looked around for binders that can take sleeved cards and couldn't find any.. so that method is pretty usless I think. I mean if you have a few 1000 cards you do not want to be sleeving them every single time you take them out and then when you put them back. Much better to have em sleeved all the time. Though I think a folder would be a better way to store them as you could kinda flip though em.

I really liked the blue insert that came with the core set but it only had one row and it ran out of room so my wife just flipped the insert  inside out, and taped the edges together forming it into a box with two rows.  I have everything released and there's still a good amount of room and I got to keep the blue insert look.

I use a plastic 9 litre 'Really Useful Box' - the one that comes with 2 x 7 section lift out trays. There are 6 card size sections and one larger section in each tray. The card sections nicely hold unsleeved cards with no problem. The sections do also hold sleeved cards from a size point of view but you just have to be a bit careful when extracting them. I print card size descriptive inserts to use as dividers or headers for each section. The larger end section is used for the tokens and threat counters etc. With the release of the next cycle I will be adding a second box. I do this with my other games - I have 2 boxes for WI and 3 boxes for AGoT.

A couple people have mentioned this method and it's what I chose to do as well. I just wanted to add that I use the cardboard pieces from inside the APs as dividers. I just trim them to fit in the lanes and then slide them between encounter decks and the different spheres of player cards. Unfortunately there aren't enough to separate each encounter group from the core set -- those just get lumped as a single stack. I like this method because it fits sleeved cards nicely.

My roommate and I took some cut-down card board and created an inner framework for the core set box similar to others posted in this thread.

The leftmost column is for sphere cards, with slots for game pieces, and our current deck builds.

The middle and right columns are for encounter cards, divided by icon type.  We used the insert that came with the core set and cut it down to create two filler pieces.  As new encounter sets come out we'll just cut down the inserts to create more card space.

I started sorting my cards a few weeks ago after I couldn't create decks in a proper way anymore. With two core set and 2 expansions a normal box is ok but after that it get's messy. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

This is how it currently looks likes. I've sorted it between all the expansions in the first row. The second row is per sphere.

I've laminated the cut out front of each expansion I still had. The first ones though I tossed when I unpacked them… Stupid me.llorando.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/llorando.gif]

Those are The Hunt for Gollum and Conflict at the Carrock. Is there anyone who still has the two empy expansion boxes and is willing to get rid of them? If yes please let me know, I would be very gratefull.

Just wanted to say, this is some epic card stuff. I like all of the ideas and mean to employ them once I get more cards.

I'm more or less wowed by this community!

Let me think about it ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] I'm not really using it BUT I haven't really decided for a way to store my cards yet either. Hm, do you need the whole box or just the front?

can you place sleeved cards in these binders though?

 

Of course not. The whole point of the binders is that you don't need to sleeve the cards.

  

yea i looked around for binders that can take sleeved cards and couldn't find any.. so that method is pretty usless I think. I mean if you have a few 1000 cards you do not want to be sleeving them every single time you take them out and then when you put them back. Much better to have em sleeved all the time. Though I think a folder would be a better way to store them as you could kinda flip though em.



I bought a bunch of Mayday sleeves which turned out to be noticeably smaller than the FFG or other brands of sleeves, and the cards sleeved in Maydays will fit into the Ultra Pro binders.  I can fit 3 x each sleeved card into each pocket, so only (core set) Gandalf needs 2 pockets - not that he spends much time in the binder :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]  I like having them in folders because it's easy to flip through and find individual cards, as you mentioned, although it does take up a lot more box/shelf space that way.

@jhaelen: I don't have a problem using both binders and sleeves myself.  The sleeves still prevent wear when actually playing with the cards.

i use the binders and sleeves method myself, only i use FFG sleeves, as I find them to be the most durable for the price.

How does that work for you? I use the FFG sleeves too and have long been thinking about investing in a binder. Is there room enough for 1-2 cards in their sleeves pr. pocket?

And another update. I created some extra placeholders so I can grab cards I seek quickly.

Next update is create the ones for the Core Set and Khazad-Dûm. Any comments or maybe improvements?

I think you may want to reprint the Tactics devider gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]

I have two of these:

GameCase_UltraPro_Portable_2.jpg [http://static.starcitygames.com/sales/cardscans/MAGMIS/GameCase_UltraPro_Portable_2.jpg]

One for Player Cards and the other for Encounter and Quest Cards.

This way I only need to bring One of the bags when playing @ my friends place.

Cards themselves are packed in Deck Protector boxes, and "indexed" using semi-transparent postit stickers, similar to these:

images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSzrVu5pUNdHDZPWBRqWFt [https://encrypted-tbn3.google.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSzrVu5pUNdHDZPWBRqWFtO5JTK5RDrEmoZaV8lh8flJKxv0yD8]

Why Semi-Transparent? Because I draw a carbon-copy of the Set Icon on them by hand, using an ultra fine black marker.

This way Each Deck Box contains Three "Sets" easily identified by their icons. I've also marked the box itself with the "letter combo" for each set.

Hmmmm… I feel I should probably take some snap-shots to back this up, right? :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I was thinking about getting some binders for my cards as well, but wasn't sure if any pages would fit the FFG sleeves.  Could I ask what pages you use to store your cards?
