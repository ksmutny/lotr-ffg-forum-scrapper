 i have 2 questions about legolas:

1) if legolas kills an enemy do the progress tokens just go on the quest or any location that you are currently on like say the old forest road? (and in general, when there are effects which mention location or quest, do they just refer to wherever "you are"?)

2) if i use rain of arrows with legolas which results in an enemy dying, is legolas's effect triggered or no?

thank you

1) is there is an active location the counters go there and not the quest....

2) Good question.. I am pretty sure the answer is no as you are technically killing them with a card effect that uses the exhaust as a cost.. not form an "attack he is part of.. I haven't got the cards in front of me right now.. but I am going to say that "No it don't" be interested to see what others think

 For your first question, keep in mind that responses are optional. This means you can choose to use Legolas' ability or not. In your early quests you will almost always choose to use it, but there are later AP's where you want to progress on your own terms.

Agree with booored.

1) Also if you need only 1 progress token to finish active location, then with Legolas effect you put 1 progress token on active location (and finish/explore/discard it), and 1 progress token on current quest card.

2) As Legolas don't participates in attack (using arrows are not "attack", this is event/action) you won't able to put progress tokens by his effect.

1. This is a definite yes. Any time you have a location up, anything that would deal with progress tokens on your quest will, instead, deal with the location.

 

2. Here I'm going to agree with the other two posters. It's just my personal opinion, but with almost 2 decades of card games under my belt I would say that NO, his effect does not trigger. This is because the "harm" going to the enemies is not from the exhausted characters, but rather from the card "Rain of Arrows".  This may seem counter-intuitive (Legolas is shooting the arrows!) but you need to think of this in terms of card mechanics and rules, not trying to place too much real-world logic into the scenario.  To SUMMARIZE: No, the card Rain of Arrows is causing the damage, not Legolas

I agree with the other responses. Legolas' ability triggers off of Legolas participating in an attack. Rain of Arrows is not an attack, it is an event.

thank you for all the feedback. i didnt know that if you have "extra" progress tokens that they go on the quest card. is this true for all scenarios such as if you have lets say 2 more mental strength than threat and the current quest card only requires one. then the "extra"progress token goes on the next quest card? is there true for all types of "extra" progress tokens situations?

 No.  The only overflow permitted is from the active location to the quest card.  You can't overflow from quest card to quest card.

I don't have my cards to hand right now, but I thought Legolas' wording was to put the token on the quest not the location.

This was clarified on the FAQ, a while back. He does put tokens on active locations unless an ability specifically says to bypass them. Since his ability does not specify, then the tokens go on the active location.

Ah, ok. I must have missed that bit. Thanks.
