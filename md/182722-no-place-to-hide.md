To Catch an Orc looks particularly brutal. That Mugash's Rage will have me cursing in no time.

Some amazing art as usual for the NM decks. Not much else to say for my part, I hope they did a good job at "fixing" the Fangorn quest.

This looks awesome! I love nightmare mode.

Well, my bet on that they did. Just look at the location that removes the Hinder keyword from every Huorn in play, and then makes every engaged Huorn attack if you try to get rid of it in the usual way.

Indeed you're right, I barely even read the NM cards  :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

I love Nightmare pack announcements. They come out of nowhere, they're almost always really well done, and you can order them on the spot. Awesome surprise. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Into Fangorn might return to be playable ^_^ [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_happy.png]

I picked mine up yesterday, but haven't had a chance to pay it, sorry. To make matters worse I'm chocked with work for at least another week.

## 12 [John Constantine on August 23, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/182722-no-place-to-hide/?do=findComment&comment=1750696)

Can you at least review the cards, not deeply?

Thanks! I really like the Vengeful Hillman. Amazing art, and I don't think he's that terrible. I could have him in the normal mode deck.

## 17 [Bullroarer Took on August 24, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/182722-no-place-to-hide/?do=findComment&comment=1751244)

I continue to be amazed at how good the Nightmare art is.

Amazing art as usual! Thanks a lot!

Thank for posting.

 

After looking at Dunland, it doesn't seems that nightmarish to me, you know... some regular stuff.

Those cards looksso good! Cannot wait when I put my hands on!

I love all 3 quest in VOI but now is piece of cake I n stanstandard mode . except CTO is still very difficult in coop.
