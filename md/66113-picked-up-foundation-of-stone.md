# [Picked up Foundation of Stone](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/66113-picked-up-foundation-of-stone/)

## 1 [Zdawg88 on June 17, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/66113-picked-up-foundation-of-stone/?do=findComment&comment=645677)

Got my copy of Foundation of Stone yesterday, and did my first solo play through of it today (Theodred, sGlorfindel, and lAragorn).  I managed to get to the last stage of the quest (It has five stages), before I was killed off by some orcs and nameless things.  It was rather fun and had some nice twists to it (stage 3 and 4), and with some adjustments to my deck, I think I could take it after a couple more playthroughs.  It's rated as a difficulty of 6, but seems harder then the last adventure pack.  (I don't put much weight into the listed difficulty rating, since I've found most of the ones in the current cycle not to be the best measuring stick)  I would recommend picking up when you can get it, if not just for the new hero Glorfindel, who is as advertised.

 Cool - being in the UK, it will be another 3 weeks before I see it, could you share with us the player cards and brief overview of the quest please?

There are basically 4 more player cards that haven't been spoiled yet.

Already revealed were:  Path of Need, Healing Herbs, Asfaloth, Light of Valinor, and Imladris Stargazer.

Once again there are no neutral cards, so we get an extra Lore card:

Daeron's Runes, basically it's a free cost event that lets you draw a couple cards, but then you have to discard a card from your hand.  It's ok I guess cause it is free, but not that impressive.

 

The two tactics cards are:

Heavy Stroke, 1 cost event that lets your Dwarf deal damage to an enemy after your dwarf has inflicted damage on that same enemy.  Basically if you damage a monster for 3 damage, play this card and do another 3 damage to the same target.

Trollshaw Scout, 2 cost ally.  This noldor ally is very similar, yet opposite of Watcher of the Bruinen.  The attack and defensive stats of the cards are switched.  But it has the same mechanic having to discard a card if, in this case, it attacks.  Has ranged, instead of sentinel too.

 

The other leadership card is:

Longbeard Elder, yet another dwarf ally, at 3 cost, and will of 2, you'll be questing with him cause he has a response that let's you look at the top card of the encounter deck.  If they card you looked at was a location you get to put a progress token on the current quest, if it wasn't, he loses one will till the end of the phase.  Since he's a dwarf, and leadership, he'd be good in a Dain deck, otherwise I probably wouldn't take him.

 

The one thing that is interesting with the quest, which doesn't make much difference if you play solo, is that during the quest the players get split up and have to play solo for a little while.  This seems like a neat mechanic and would be fun to play with more people.  Definitely will be tough if your deck cannot support itself.  You're not allowed to play cards on other players, and none of your cards have any effect on the other players.  Each player get's their own staging area, and quest card to deal with.

So the Lore Event goes like this? Cost 0, Action: draw two cards (any player or you only? guess the latter) and then discard a card from your hand?

Thanks a lot for the info! I am liking the scout very much.

The last part sound cool!!! Really like it! Looks like is a cool quest!!! And really love idea first quest with 5 quest card. Difficult 6 is also sound good!!

We really have now cool quest like RHG, TLD and WIATW. RTR i think is most bad quest but is much better then previous cycle where is half of the quests  is rubbish in my opinion. Good News!!!

Please give us more info about quest cards and encounter cards. I know most of the players want to know about players cards but in my opinion most important is quest. Thanks

I'm in the same boat. People are always spoiling the player cards, but you have to beg, plead and threaten their families before anything of the encounter and quest cards is revealed. Hell, if FFG put out a pack with two quests (30 cards each, or maybe a hero, so 30+29), I'd be all over it, actually at this point much more happier than the current format, though no chance of change. Would mean A) I wouldn't have to go through my decks yet again to see if there are cards to get swapped with the new cards and B) 20 plays (or two weeks) per purchase.

If Daeron's Runes does that, it is a must include for almost every deck that has a lore hero (save for a Zigil deck).

## 10 [Zdawg88 on June 17, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/66113-picked-up-foundation-of-stone/?do=findComment&comment=645720)

Daeron's Runes just effects yourself I'm assuming.  Card text reads "Action:  Draw 2 cards.  Then, discard 1 card from your hand."

As for the quest.  There are five stages like I mentioned.  Stage 4, has 4 card quest cards (each player is dealt one).  I actually play through every quest the first time without even looking at the quest cards.  Makes the game more surprising the first time around, but usually I lose.  Also, foundation of stone uses twists and turns, deeps of moria, and goblins of the deep encounter sets.  The foundation of stone encounter set is set aside at the beginning of the quest and is not used till later.

Stage 1, nothing really special here, need 9 progress to get through.

Stage 2, 12 progress, every player that commits characters to the quest has to discard 2 cards off of their deck.  If you can quest quick, this one doesn't hurt you for more then a round.  Plus if you are using Imladris Stargazer you can stack your deck so you can lessen the blow of what cards you lose.  That card definitely changed the game.

Stage 3, 0 progress.  This stage goes by really fast as you are "Washed Away!" (name of the stage)  This is where the party gets split up.  You also lose some of your attachments, depending on type.  Also, the foundation of stone encounter cards get shuffled in, with all the enemy and treachery cards of the other encounter sets.  This becomes the new encounter deck.  I'm not sure if I did this exactly right, seemed kind of confusing the first time.  Each player gets a random stage 4 card, and is basically on their own.

Stage 4.  They range in progress requirements.  I didn't notice until I looked at them now.  This is pretty cool that they are all different.  Low progress value is 5, high is 17.  Basically when you complete your stage 4, you join up with another player (your pick), or if everyone is together, you move on to stage 5.

Stage 5, 11 progress.  Each player cannot commit more allies to the quest then the number of heroes they have committed.  I was down to 2 heroes at this point my first play through, so this made it hard to quest in a solo game where you often rely on a lot of allies.  There's also a nasty treachery card that causes you to have to shuffle one of your heroes back into your deck (basically they get lost).  You get to put them back into play if you draw them.  I happen to fall victim to this in the last stage.

mmmmm……this quest seems very tailored to multiplayer- there seems to be alot of quest effects aimed that way…..how would the 'party' work when there is only 1 player?

## 12 [lleimmoen on June 17, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/66113-picked-up-foundation-of-stone/?do=findComment&comment=645729)

Yes, that does seem like some fun is lost for solo. You still get to pick though. It also seems this could be called the Long Dark instead as it is rather long.

I am interested in that treachery, find it quite neat.

And yes, the Lore event will likely prove very strong.

## 13 [Zdawg88 on June 17, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/66113-picked-up-foundation-of-stone/?do=findComment&comment=645731)

I play mostly solo, and this, while the quest seems more geared toward multi-player, seems beatable solo.  While the last adventure pack I thought was easier solo, then with a couple players, Foundation of Stone seems like it may be a little harder solo.  One thing at least playing solo, you only have to take on one of the random four stage 4 cards.

I stand by my initial assessment.  Daeron's Runes is an amazingly strong card and is an auto-include for any deck with a Lore hero.

I'm sorry but I cannot see why it is a strong card.  You play this card, then you draw two cards and discard one card.  The net result is zero card gain, but of course, you can try to improve the quality of your hand of cards in the process.  At least I won't consider it an auto-include.

## 16 [EchPiEl on June 18, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/66113-picked-up-foundation-of-stone/?do=findComment&comment=645770)

Yes, it does exactly that, and that's why it's an autoinclude. You play it as soon as you draw it, and the net result is you have seen 2 more cards from your deck and probably increased your hand quality at no cost at all. Your deck has been virtually reduced for all calculations by 3 cards, the 3 Daeron's Runes, as long as you can play them as soon as you draw them, and big news, shorter decks are better decks, they improve the probability of drawing the card/s you need.

Stop thinking solely in terms of card advantage.

The card does two things.  First of all, it trims your deck.  In this card game (like most CCGs/LCGs) smaller decks are almost always superior to larger decks.  The tighter your deck, the less random the game becomes and the the greater chance you have of drawing your most powerful cards.  Assuming all other factors are equal, a 50 card deck will out perform an 80 card deck by a substantial margin.  Daeron's Runes effectively trims your deck.   If this card was a 0 cost event that let you draw one card it would still be valuable.

The second thing it does is allow you to more options.  Given the choice between drawing 7 cards, and drawing eight cards and discarding one, you always want to chose the later (save for some exceptionally rare corner cases).  You can choose the best cards, and get rid of the worst card.  It gives you another way to burn unplayable uniques when Eowyn isn't on the board.  In addition, discarding cards can actualy be advantageous.  We have all had situations where we want to play Erebor Hammersmith, but have yet to lose an attachment.

Most importantly, the card has 0 cost.  it doesn't use resources, it has event timing, it replaces itself.  The card has no disadvantages.  Short of not having sufficient copies for all of your Lore decks, there no reason not to include this card.  Every Lore deck out their would be improved by adding this card in.

As always you have nailed it completely there is not much to add to this… This guys doesn't post much in this forum but I know him form CoC and pretty much everything he says is bang on… listen to him… He is like RaidSkull but takes the time to explain properly.

The effect is called "sifting". As you sift though your deck and ensure that out of your draws you have better chance of having a value card in your hand. It isn't card advantage technically.. but it as stated above.. it is darn similar. The big draw back to sifting has always been card loss though discard.. but with teh insane card draw in this game and will of twh west card cycling this "drawback" is nearly meaningless.. added to that the including of Hama as the first card to basically turn your yard into a second hand… well… sifting is going to be a MAJOR effect in this game and I would expect many power decks to be using this maniac..

I would recommend "LotusVaults" I deal with them through Ebay… but they have a website as well.. anyway.. they sell all the LCG stuff at a VERY reasonable price and also do combined shipping. In au we have to wait 1-2 months for it to come out, and then it is 20 bucks a pack. You can get a single pack form lotusvault including shipping for less.. but if you buy say 4 in a single go you can get it nearly the same price that yanks pay. LotusVault also gets their stock at zero day.

If you are willing to wait a little bit they "best" place is TheBookRepository. They are a UK store I think but have zero shipping costs to anywhere in the world and stock the entire FFG range… wish they stocked more boardgame companies like plaidhat otr riogrand… but oh well. Anyway… they get their stock much latter but still well before say Germany or Australia and other euro and ociance countries.. and I think they re the best place to getFFG products sent from overseas.. (assuming you want English printed text)

Sifting, eh?  Thanks for the terminology, booored, I was searching for the right vocabulary to describe card.

most of my terms come form MTG. MTG is so old and so influential that as far as I know there hasn't ever been a single effect that wasn't game specific that wasn't used in that game first, and "in first" I means first by years.. witch is why their terms usually stick to other games… Though I think the "blank text box" rule in the LCGs at FFG have no been in MTG…. Also and most of those terms come from the 1st card to use the effect.. like a "mill deck" for example comes form the card "millstone"

Also, to add… there are a lot of VERY good UNIQUE cards in this game. Sometimes its valuable to have 2 or 3 copies of a unique card because drawing it can be such a game changer, or your deck can heavily depend on getting them into circulation. The problem is is that once you've got the card in play, the duplicates become far less useful. The ability to discard a unique that you're dependent on in exchange for 2 new cards is extremely useful, and I would say could easily make or break a victory.

Unless I and all the players I know do not somehow belong among "everyone" you're wrong, again. I'd played MtG for almost ten years, yet I haven't used any of those terms once for this game. I don't really miss MtG in any respect.

I have seen you use the word scry in posts.. so you are either liying or these are so common to you you do not even know you are saying it. Look about at e posts… people say tap and untap constantly.. it is nearly in every thread. It has nothing to do with MTG, I mean I havn't played that game for over 10 years.. but it IS influential and every card game is basically copying it… including this game… as EVERY card effect (so far) has been in magic for decades. Withc is why people with card game experience use MTG terms.. cause you are not suddenly going to start saying some new term like "kneeling" when there ius a perfectly good term like TAP already around that you and millions of other card game players have been using for like 20 years. Same with scry and now sift.

No, it doesn't. Still, it guarantees that the cards you absolutely do not want to draw, won't be drawn.

No I haven't used "scry" once, sorry. But I can imagine the vocabulary would transfer, I was just saying it hasn't for me. I have seen some people use it, true, I just thought it wasn't a majority. Not that important I guess but just from the linguistic point of view, I much prefer "exhaust" and "ready" to "tap-untap" and I certainly see people having no problem adjusting to the terminology.

As for the influence, I don't know that many card games so I have to trust you on that one. And I do see similarities in this game but the player vs game makes it very different in my view. Also the way the cards are distributed is totally different. Finally, as for the theme, I think even MtG was a bit influenced by Tolkien (as a fantasy genre).

Angus Lee said:

 Stop thinking solely in terms of card advantage.

The card does two things.  First of all, it trims your deck.  In this card game (like most CCGs/LCGs) smaller decks are almost always superior to larger decks.  The tighter your deck, the less random the game becomes and the the greater chance you have of drawing your most powerful cards.  Assuming all other factors are equal, a 50 card deck will out perform an 80 card deck by a substantial margin.  Daeron's Runes effectively trims your deck.   If this card was a 0 cost event that let you draw one card it would still be valuable.

The second thing it does is allow you to more options.  Given the choice between drawing 7 cards, and drawing eight cards and discarding one, you always want to chose the later (save for some exceptionally rare corner cases).  You can choose the best cards, and get rid of the worst card.  It gives you another way to burn unplayable uniques when Eowyn isn't on the board.  In addition, discarding cards can actualy be advantageous.  We have all had situations where we want to play Erebor Hammersmith, but have yet to lose an attachment.

Most importantly, the card has 0 cost.  it doesn't use resources, it has event timing, it replaces itself.  The card has no disadvantages.  Short of not having sufficient copies for all of your Lore decks, there no reason not to include this card.  Every Lore deck out their would be improved by adding this card in. 

 

 



 

Just a quick two cents:  In your first, paragraph you mention that even if it were a "0 cost event that let you draw one card it would still be valuable".  Actually, if it were I wouldn't bother looking at it.  Playing one event card to simply draw another single other card seems less than efficient, particularly if you're trying to hit that golden "50-card" deck count (except for those occasional times where you need to burn a duplicate unique, but there are better uses for those (Eowyn, PoL, etc).  BUT you nailed it in the rest of your reasoning, and actually, it's for all those reasons (hand improvement, deck cycling, etc) that this card IS superior to a 0-cost 1-draw card.  Thanks for your thoughts!

But like Bohemond said, even at 0-cost 1-draw it's still well worth it. You're basically skirting around the 50-card deck limit and playing with a 47-card deck at that point, which means a little better efficiency for getting you're good cards up. And this card is even better than that. Pretty much auto-play card x3 for me as well.

Response: After a Dwarf deals X damage to an enemy during combat, deal an additional X damage to that enemy.  (limit once per phase.)

 For the record, I much prefer exhaust/refresh to tap/untap, one reason being that tap/untap sounds like a game and I like the immersion of employing characters that exhaust and refresh, rather than pieces of cardbaord that turns sideways and right-side-up again.

Why? The one thing Gimli does well is to fell enemies in single blow. I mean the whole point of having Gimli is to make him hit hard enough so you don't have to hit twice. So you're already "spending" a few card slots for that strategy, why would you then "waste" another just so you maybe use it once or twice in a few games; because once you get the Gimli thing going, you should be fine to kill the vast majority of enemies anyways.

Just to be clear, I think the card is awful and doubt I would ever include it in a deck.  If you compare Heavy Stroke to "Khazad, Khazad", I think you can begin to see why Heavy Stroke is built for Gimli.  On a dwarf with three or four attack Khazad Khazad! will always be more effective (before you even begin to factor in cost).  +3 attack will do more than doubling your damage.  Khazad Khazad!  is clearly the better card, but their are some corner cases when Heavy Stroke outperform or augment it.  And those cases arise when you a single dwarf hitting for big damage against a larger target (Greater Cave Troll, Nazghul, Watcher, etc.)  Gimli is the dwarf most likely to make those big swings.

## 52 [lleimmoen on June 19, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/66113-picked-up-foundation-of-stone/?do=findComment&comment=646451)

Right.

I agree that the card is awful. Mostly because I see no reason why making such a card when there are so many options. This card really brings little to none to the game.

I am not asking for super powerful cards, interesting is more the word (and I'm getting it mostly, don't get me wrong designers). If the card were meant for anyone, then I'd think it be another "nice" way to boost Dúnhere, or other interesting combat "options" like Mirkwood Runner.

I enjoy (combat) cards like Fresh Tracks, there's nothing about it that screams over-powered but it brings new choices.

 I agree.  It's a very situational card for when you just need a few extra points of damage.  (The Carrock Trolls are another use.)  So why limit it more by making it dwarf only?

## 54 [MyNeighbourTrololo on June 20, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/66113-picked-up-foundation-of-stone/?do=findComment&comment=646789)

There can be only 3 copies of the same card in the deck legally.

So, you may include heavy stroke as something like weaker version of Khazad for the case you're not so lucky with your hand and/or drawing.

From other perspective, Khazad plainly gives one dwarf +3 atk untl the end of phase, while Stroke deals direct damage based on what character have dealt this turn.

For instance, damage from heavy stroke is not combat damage and therefor can't be cancelled by some shadow effects and stuff. And it ignores defense, if this means something. So, basically, if you manage to group up enough men to take down half health of heavy armored foe, you can use the Stroke to finish it immediately.

Btw, FFG staff, if you are reading this - congrats for the Foundations of Stone adventure! It immediately became one of my favourite quests, perhaps even the most favourite. Very innovative mechanisms (Quest stage 4 and its enemies, of course!) and very thematic cards and drawings. They depict more "mythic" places (the greenish- blueish pics on quest card 4, and the location which gives you access to objectives)! Good job!

Hmm sounds really ok cose i heard from other players who already got it this quest is really good. From both perspective: coop game and solo game. Is quite hard, interesting and going to be more harder with progress. As is should to be in m y opinion. Sounds like FOS and TAF will be 2 most cool quest after each other!

Yes, this quest is really cool. Though I need to warn you, it is not as hard as Massing at Osgiliath, or EfDG and RTM solo ;-) But the scaling should be good. I only tried it 2 times in 2-player-games, but the mechanisms for scaling look exceptionally good.

It's a very good scenario, and one of the most innovative quests to date. FoS plays fine solo, but it really shines in multiplayer (since the multiple staging areas can really disrupt cooperative strategies). Not super difficult, but quite fun with a group.

Got FoS today, played it twice, and I already love it. Lots of fun in solo mode, multi player must be even more awesome. My second game was very interesting. I played with new Glorfindel, Frodo and Bifur. I lost Frodo against "Unexpected Trap" in round  1, but had two copies of "Resourceful" in my starting hand to balance this out. Imladris Starglazer is the powerful card she promised to be, very useful in this scenario. Threat managing becomes a whole lot easier with her, and some of the monster's effects can be manipulated by her.

This is an excellent designed quest, a challenge but still beatable (at least with spirit/lore). The opponents are awesome, the treacheries are nasty, the locations not too harmful, and there are some nice objectives to claim. I like the restriction of the last encounter card (you're not allowed to send more characters questing than heroes), I like the branching paths in stage 3/4, like the increasing difficulty towards the end. This one is indeed well done!

After six games I am at 4-2. A lot depends on the adventure card that one gets dealt in stage 4. IMO the toughest one is "Cave of the Ancient One" (translation correct?). This card forces you to reveal 4 encounter cards, but needs only 5 progress tokens. In my last game I had a card that forced me to discard my whole hand and to reveal two encounter cards. This one needs 11 progress. That game was rather easy, but still fun and interesting.

The (Ancient) Nameless One's are nasty enemies, but can be defeated easily with Gandalf, before they do any harm. Stargazer is very helpful to reduce their ATT dn HP to a minimum.

Btw I love how they screwed the Ziggy decks with this one!

Got it today. Play 3 games lose all of them! My Elven brother +Eowin deck not really good against this one.Change Eowyn to new Glorifindel.

Play another 2 game. 1 lose and win one at last! But is not  cose of Glorifindel  but is really depend which quest 4 you got. If you get easy one you have a god chance to win. If you get one with 4 cards revealed every time i lose. Anayway quest is cool cannot wait for coop game with 2 or even 3 players.

This time FFG got to the point. Hope SAF will be also cool!

Haven't played it solo yet.  Completed a 3-player game, and do agree it depends largely on which site 4 you pull.  We probably got a perfect match for the decks we were running, and ran through sites 4 and 5 in just two turns.  (Gimli/Dain dwarves dealt with Nameless things, Loragorn and Glorfindel decks quested)… I don't expect that same fortune to hold in the next few iterations as I try different decks for solo play.  Do enjoy the variety this game affords as you attempt different configurations for each encounter.
