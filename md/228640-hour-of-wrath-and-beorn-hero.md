I know that hour of wrath does not work for Beorn Hero, but I don't know if it works if Hour of Wrath triggers with the Valour action.

 

Can Beorn Hero attack without exhausting when the Valour action triggers because the target is the player not the Hero?

Even though it is seemingly targeting the player - the effect is still trying to effect Beorn, and he is immune to those effects.  At least, that is my understanding of it.

Yeah, immune cards "ignore the effects of player cards."

As long as you ''chose'' a hero, Beorn is immuned. But for the second part of the effect, I think it works with Beorn, because the effect targets all the heroes...

But Beorn is immune to player card effects.  So I don't think he cannot be effected by any player card, regardless of how it targets him (directly or indirectly).

Yeah, I guess.

The FAQ entry (which is quite extensive) makes a big deal about how immune cards can be affected by framework effects even though they can't be affected by player card effects. So for example, Quick Strike just creates another opportunity for your hero to attack. During that attack, he's just following the normal rules, so he can attack an immune-to-player-card-effects enemy. And weapons modify the attack value of the hero they're on -- but when the hero is attacking an immune enemy, it's just his attack strength (a normal framework effect) that is counted. The fact that that attack strength was modified by a card earlier doesn't matter: the immune enemy takes the full damage of his strength boosted by the weapon effect. (I believe that's the case for weapons and other stat-boosting attachments; someone please correct me if there's been a contrary ruling.)

 

However, "all that player's heroes do not exhaust to attack or defend" is not a framework effect. Nothing in the regular rules gives an exception to the "you must exhaust to defend or attack" rule. So since that's a player card effect, it cannot affect Beorn. The only player card effects that can affect Beorn are the ones printed on his own card: Beorn does not exhaust to defend, and so on. (Interestingly, the "cannot be affected by player card effects" rule does not make any exception for "except for the effects printed on this very card", but I don't think anyone is playing this incorrectly. Beorn does get the effects printed on his own card, he just can't be affected by any other player cards.)

I remembver a quest with an encounter card effect that blanks the text of all players characters in play, and I had Beorn. beleive me that after this turn, he had a few attachment on him!

Once that encounter card effect goes away, though, Beorn's "cannot have attachments" comes back. At that point the attachments on him can no longer be attached, so they go in the discard pile.

 

It sure is nice while it lasts, though.

I think it was a condition that activated as long as the hero had damage on him, and since you can't heal Beron... it lasted until the end!   ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]
