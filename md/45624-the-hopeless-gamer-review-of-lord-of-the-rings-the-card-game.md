 Now that I've got a couple games under my belt, I've decided to throw up a review over at The Hopeless Gamer to help those still debating about whether the game would work for them: www.thehopelessgamer.blogspot.com/2011/04/playing-with-myself-is-fun-review-of.html

Summary: it is awesome.

 Not a problem at all! I was happy to have some original game art I could use for the post, and your recent thread with you art for Beravor was a very nice treat leading up to the release of the game. I'm glad you enjoyed the review.

 I enjoyed the review. Although you did say "Monsters will attack the player with the highest threat equal to or less than their threat."
