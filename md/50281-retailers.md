Is there a list of retailers selling the Lord of the Rings Card Game?  I live near Pittsburgh, PA an do not know who in my area sell this game or the expansions.  Thank you for your help!

I don't know if there's a list anywhere, but coincidentally, I know of a LGS in Oakland (near Pitt) called Phantom of the Attic. When I visited a friend in Pittsburgh a little while ago, they had the Core Set in stock in the the store. Idk about the expansions, but I do know that the guy is always willing to order stuff for you and can get it in stock really quickly. Hope that helps!

None of the game stores in my area sell the game either, but I was able to talk to their guy in charge of ordering and get them to purchase my copies on special order, which saved me having to pay a bunch of unecessary shipping fees.  I would imagine that store owners in your area would be similarly willing to work out a deal, especially if it'll stop an online retailer from "stealing" sales from them.  This also allowed me to get a great deal on some of the FFG sleeves, without having to pay almost as much in shipping as the packs of sleeves cost themselves.

edit: I can't give you the direct link because I can't access BoardGameGeek at work, but there was a guy a while ago offering a "subscription" service to this game, where he'll send you an email when each expansion is released and you can then order it.  I think the price was something like $13.50 per adventure pack and free first class USPS shipping, which is by far the lowest price I've found anywhere.  If you want, you can contact him at auctions@prunesquallor.net [auctions@prunesquallor.net] to be put on his mailing list.

2nd edit: I think that this is the link, although I can't check to be 100% sure while at work. http://tinyurl.com/4339yw5 [http://tinyurl.com/4339yw5]

Good luck!

That's me, thanks for the plug.

The BGG posting is here, and all the information is still valid : http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/645989/subscription-service-for-lotr-lcg-adventure-packs [http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/645989/subscription-service-for-lotr-lcg-adventure-packs]

All of my subscribers had their Hunt For Gollum packs mailed out to them on Thursday of last week, and I've sold the remaining ones that I had.  New subscribers are welcome but will have to content themselves with starting off with Conflict At The Carrock.  I'm trying to get some more copies of Hunt For Gollum, but that could change.

My goal with pricing in the US is to offer a price that's competitive with standard retail, even after you factor in shipping.  Plus, you don't have to comb the web for press releases or hassle your retailer all the time (since FFG is so unpredictable with their actual release schedule).  When I get a new release in hand, I send you a PayPal invoice, so you only have to watch your in-box.

Hey Prune, do you plan to sell PoD cards for LotR LCG (like Massing at Osgiliath) as well once they are released?
