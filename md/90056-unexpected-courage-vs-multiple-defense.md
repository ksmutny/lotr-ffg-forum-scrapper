So if you read the rules is states that when a character is committed to something it is exhausted. You can ready it again but it is still considered defending, questing whatever. So, if you quest and ready the character again it cannot commit once more in that same quest phase. How about defense? It says that a character is only considered defending for the remaining of the attack but is that the attack from that particular enemy or the whole enemy attacking phase? I know you can defense then ready and use same character for attack. But how about multiple defense? This game really screws my brain sometimes :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

i have always played it so you can multi defend. i think if you take behind strong walls as an example- that card is meant of course for multi defending of the same character as it readies and give +1 defense

I didn't know this! I always use cards like Unexpected Courage to quest and then defend/attack or defend and then attack. If it is indeed okay to defend twice with the same character, that makes matters easier. Thanks.

I can't see any reason why you wouldn't be able to use unexpected courage to re ready and defend again. after all Elrohir can re-ready to defend again after defending unless I have that character all wrong.

Thats what Elrohir does yes.

I also never used unexpected courage this way, but it seems reasonable you can multi defend or whatsoever

Beregond likes it.

 

Beorn lives for multi-defending.  So does Grimbeorn.
