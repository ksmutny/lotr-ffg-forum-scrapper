Ok Here's the question: The Hobbit on the Doorstep or The Hobbit: Overhill and Under hill? Which is better in your opinion?  I have niether so that is why I am making this thread.  It would be awesome if you could give a 0-10 ranking on cards, quests and overall.  And please include which one you would buy if you could only get one.  Any information would be awesome but the more the better (for me) :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

Thanks!

let me see…..

hobbit pack 1 :

heros - beorn is great, i use him in my favourite tactics deck, thorin and the other dwarves are some great characters, obviously work alot better in dwarf decks though…..7/10

player cards- some really good cards here, gandalf ally, goblin cleaver and foe hammer, bofur, thrors map until it got shafted, there are a few nice cards that are thematic but not very very useful such as spare hood and cloak and a very good tale…8/10

quests - 1st one is a great quest, theme is good, its a challenge but not overly so with that right strategy, 2nd one is a favourite, the chance to kill lots of goblins, the riddle one is a bit of a let down to me, and is aweful in solo play. so id give it…. 7/10

theme- great, the designers stuck well to the books, with amazing art and orginality. 9/10

31/40

 

hobbit pack 2

heros - you get 2 of what i think are the best heros in the game, bard becuase he is amazing and a great character and balin, because he is again a great character and with leadership resources can save you from those aweful shadow cards. the other dwarves are like pack 1, specific, but i think the other two outweigh this (and im not saying dwarven  specific is bad, just err…specific)…….9/10

player cards - following on from bard, you get some awesome tactics cards. yew bow is a favourite, and straight shot is so useful. black arrow is epic. thrors key is one of those cards where when you need it, it is a game saver, but other times a bit so -so, but i really like the art and theme. the other evetns are in the ok region. but better than pack 1 i think 9/10

quests- very hard…..spiders quest is tough but doable with a good strategy, i havnt yet beaten the other two (the last is hard, but very fun quest with unique types of play) if you are looking for a challenge then 8/10 but if not then 7/10

theme- as pack 1 but better i think. art work is great on some of the encounter cards, and of course player cards. 10/10

36/40 or 35/40

so overall the on the doorstep wins for me. its just the player cards are so great…in every way that makes it the slightly bit better

Thanks so much!  What do you think of Bombur with a dwarf deck?

well if im honest i havent tried him….though im working on it (i just cant bring myself to dismantle my current decks)

i can certainly see his ability coming in useful, especially with the dwarven traits. and i suppose wack a burning brand on him and his a solid defender…..even better with balin around…..and you could put hardy leadership to give +1 hit point…and of course the theme's just awesome

actually saying all of that makes me want to go and try him…

I was rather skeptical of Bombur, but I put him in my Lore/Spirit deck and he works REALLY well. With a little help he becomes a solid defender and being able to get running with those dwarf combos is pretty key.

 

Both sets have some good player cards (Foe Hammer is one of my favorites), but I think I like On the Doorstep's more over all.

 

I definitely prefer the quests from On the Doorstep, all three are really challenging, but beatable. Of those three, the second one is my least favorite, but is different and fun. Battle of Five Armies is probably one of my favorite quests.

 

I've got some issues with the quests from Overhill and Underhill.

The first one is okay, like Conflict at the Carrock, but a bit more interesting, but the annoying mechanic with trying to find the treasures while attempting to survive the trolls really bugs me. I'm definitely in the camp that says "to heck with it, just kill the trolls and then play with the treasures". Although, I did really like the mechanic of being able to kill the trolls or "wait them out".

The second one also has some fun stuff, but losses me in how I'm forced to engage and slay the Mountain Giants. If it had been about avoidence and survival, rather than combat, I'd like it a lot more. For that part at least, killing goblins in the second part is fine, of course.

The third one might well be my least favorite quest in the whole game. It's arbitrary and meta and annoying.

Over Hill and Under Hill

 

Heroes

The heroes are very good, I like Beorn though I don't use him very much (tried himonly in 1 deck and I have to say he's really cool); Nori is awsome if you play at least one dwarf per turn; Ori is arguably one of the best to include in a dwarven deck (plus hos art is amazing); Thorin is…Thorin… XD I mean this guy paired with dain quests for 4, attacks for 4 and gives you 2 resources per turn if you have 5 dwarves. my opinion : 9/10

 

Player Cards

Some of the best player cards are in this box in my opinion. The allies are awsome, Gandalf is probably the strongest card in the game paired with some threat reduction, Bofur is really good (2 WP for Tactic plus his wepon fetch ability), Dori is very solid and has a fine ability, Fili and Kili in a dwarven sinergy are amazing (they're my favourite dwarves and Kili's art is beautiful), if you have Dain you gain 4 WP with 3 resources…need I say more ? The attachments are good. I'm not a fan of Spare Hood and Cloak because there are many cards that are much better to ready a character. Cram (talk about ready heroes !) is just awsome…you can get it back with the Erebor Hammersmith and use it again and again. Thror's Map is also a very good card (deals with location with nasty travel effects). Tactics events are the best (I'd give it a 10 just for foe hammer). The other three I never used in a deck though I can see that Late Adventurer might be useful somewhere, just like Expecting Mischief…as for A Very Good Tale I'm not very convinced…to use it properly you need something to see the first cards of your deck and you'd still be discarding 3 potentially useful cards.  my opinion : 9/10

 

Scenarios

I think this is the worst part of this box. I don't like scenarios where you have to put cards in your deck only because they match so you can discard them more easily to gain benefits and the third quest is just like this. I also find the first one a bit boring…all you have to do is quest hard…just that…it goes from very easy if you want to go through it to very hard (random more than hard) if you want to get the treasures. Scenario 2 is a good one though. my opinion 6/10

 

Theme 9/10. Well the theme is good XD

 

Overall 8/10 (9/10 maybe…since foe hammer's in this pack XD)

 

 

On the Doorstep

 

Heroes 

 

I have to say I only tried Bombur (though Bard is one of my favourite characters and is in my favourite sphere). So I'll say that I don't like Oin very much (his artwork his substandard for this game and his ability seems to me a bit lacking), but I haven't tried him yet, so it's just an impression. Bard is great in multi but a bit less in solo, though great yew bow may solve that problem…his 2 WP may help. I think Balin is good (not great like most think…his ability simply discards a shadow to get another one ) but I like his low threat (for a ledership character) and good stats. As for the one I tried, Bombur, he's really great. Being able to use Thorin and Ori ability in turn 2 is the best, plus he's a solid defender ! my opinion : 8/10

 

Allies

 

We have new versions of Bifur, Gloin and Dwalin…I have to say they are all good. I have not tried dwalin yet because I like his hero version so much that when I build a dwarf deck I generally end up getting him as a hero. As for the other two they're great, an ally who draws 2 cards as he enters and a 2 WP (3 with dain) for the cost of 1 resource (thanks to his ability) dwarf are just awsome even though they depend on the 5 dwarves in play rule. Well the attachments are just awsome…Black Arrow hasn't come out of my decks since I got it, thror's key is a weird card but not useless, the king under the mounatin is astonishing (some luck needed), same for expert treasure hunter. Great yew bow has its uses with the right heroes and cards…still have to try it though. This pack's events are what I like the least…the ravens of the mountain is a completely random card, to me oh my kinsfolk is peculiar and might come in handy but it wouldn't take cards like durin's song, sneak attack and we are not idle out…so not that strong, desperate alliance is funny but most of the times you'll use it just for fun…plus it's multi only. The only great event is straight shot (once again tactics)…It' good but not as good as the tactics events in OHaUH. my opinion 7/10

 

Scenarios

 

Luckily we only have one boring scenario in this pack and the other two are awsome (The battle of five armies is epic !) my opinion 8/10

 

Theme - 9/10…the theme is once again great XD.

 

Overall 8/10 

 

 

If I could get only one of these two I think I'd get the first one….

Thanks guys!  That's very helpfull.  Since I usually care more about the quests instead of the cards I think I'm leaning towards Oon the doorstep.

If you want to play a dwarven deck, Ori is almost as essential as Dain. Getting two cards every turn as early as turn 2 or 3 is just unbelievable.

Beorn, Thorin and Nori are pretty good too.

 

Balin and Oin are great heroes but not as good as Ori. Bard's threat is too high compared to Legolas. Bombur is fun but really not amazing.

 

Player cards are fairly even, there's some good in both boxes. First one has better Events (especially for dwarven decks), second one has better Attachments (less Dwarf oriented).

 

And when it comes to the quests I prefer the second one but not by much.

I really want to like Bard and think he's pretty cool, but Legolas does put him to shame pretty hard, especially due of the existence of Rivendell Blade.

That's true. But I'd rather just play Mirivor and/or Cram on Legolas and just have him be twice as deadly. :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]
