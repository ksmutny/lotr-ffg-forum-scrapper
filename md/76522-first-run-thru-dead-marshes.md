The escape tests are throwing me for a loop.

If I pull a treachery card in the quest phase that requires me to run an escape test, I have two questions:

1. Do I count the "Escape" value on the treachery card with the Escape values on the cards I have to draw? (The example in the TDM Rule page leads me to think NO).

2. Do I still attempt an Escape test at the end of the quest phase?

Thanks!

1. No. If the Treachery tells you to make an escape attempt and draw two cards you only count the escape value of those two cards.

2. Yes, after each quest phase you have to make an escape attempt (unless Gollum escaped and got shuffled back into the encounter deck)

Take in mind that if gollum escapes you dont have to make an escape test after the quest phase, but if a treachery card comes that says to make an escape test the you will have to do it.

So the FORCED on Gollum only comes into play when he is in the staging area?

Yes. Cards only trigger their effects, when they are in play. So Gollums card text doesnt matter if he is in the encounter deck
