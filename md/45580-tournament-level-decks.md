So I ended up getting 3 Starter Sets.

I am pulling out 3 of Each Card for Decks....however I do have a question about Tournament Level Decks and it regards NOT the Player Decks, but the Encounter Deck.

Do you ever add more cards to the encounter deck than what comes standard in the set? 

Example, the base set comes with 2 Hill Trolls....is that all that is ever added to the encounter deck or would there ever be a need to add more? 

Basically, are the encounter decks set up a specific way and not to be tampered with?

Considering Tournament Encounter Decks are probably going to be provided at the Tournament I don't think there are going to be any rules about making an encounter deck. At least not any time soon.

 

However for the purposes of casual play you can probably do whatever you want. If you just combine the decks the game will probably be more random because you could get 4 Hill Trolls early on or get nothing but weaklings the entire game. The standard decks are probably make with a certain distribution to make them a certain difficulty and adding or changing cards will change that. However feel free to add in a couple of extra Hill Trolls if you are feeling the game is too easy. lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif]

Are there any already written rules on how tournaments will work? I'll be interested to see how they plan to make such a different format work in that setting.

You and your partner are watched like hawks by one of an endless supply of FFG staff judges to ensure you don't cheat.

Or it's competitive co-op against your partner and who ever gets out Wandering Took  in the case of mutual survival wins the game. 

There's no official format yet. I'll be curious to see how viable 50 card decks are. They certainly make the game more difficult at this very moment.
