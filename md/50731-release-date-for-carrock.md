Carrock expansion will be released this Thursday, August the 4th.

This is a date for polish release.

  August 4th? That would be awfully fast, but then again, there was a combined preview article for THfG and CatC...

Was the polish publisher accurate in regard to announcing the release date for The Hunt for Gollum or the Core Set?

## 3 [guciomir on July 31, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/50731-release-date-for-carrock/?do=findComment&comment=506721)

Don't remember the core set, but the official date for gollum was correct.

## 4 [Shelfwear on July 31, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/50731-release-date-for-carrock/?do=findComment&comment=506722)

The German publisher says the same: 4th August. They did a double announcement prior HfG stating that Gollum will be released on 19th July (which was really released on that day in Germany) and Carrock on 4th August.

You say its awfully fast, I say its still behind the original release date :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 august 4th would be this upcoming thursday, as much as i'd love that to be true, i'm skeptical.

on the "upcoming" page, it still shows the set as "at the printer" (of course, it shows HfG as "shipping now" and not "at your local store"). 

either way, let's hope for an update to the upcoming page soon but thursday seems awfully soon.

## 6 [Mattr0polis on July 31, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/50731-release-date-for-carrock/?do=findComment&comment=506776)

Any news on a true release date for USA?

Like Dain said, the Upcoming page still says at the printer for us. I know some other countries got HfG a lot earlier than us, I wonder if that will continue to be the norm?

Hunt for Gollum isn't at my local store.

Right now I'm starting to wonder if any of the expansions will ever reach the FFG radar blackspot that is the UK

It must be translation problems.  Adding all those additional 'u's takes time.

I ordered my copy of The Hunt for Gollum from Maelstrom Games in the UK (I'm in Australia), and they posted it on the 27th of June; I received it in the first week of July, well before the American release. Maybe try other stores to see whether it's just your local store that doesn't have it?

Guys, supposedly several expansions are releasing at GenCon, which coincidentally happens to be this Thursday, August 4.  Take a look at this GeekList:

boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/69053/item/1727064#item1727064 [http://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/69053/item/1727064#item1727064]

I don't know where this individual got this information from.  I do know that I will be at FFG's booth Thursday morning!

I saw that list a little while ago, too.  Before playing this game I had never paid attention to how FFG tends to release any expansions for their LCGs, what kind of "previews" they do, or what their GenCon participation is, but I would be pretty blown away if they released "early editions" or something of any adventure packs apart from CatC.  I'm excited to see what happens, though!  If they do, I'm gonna regret not going even more... sad.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sad.gif]

One additional note.  Drakkenstrike also mentions it in his GenCon Video Wishlist.





I don't know if he pulled this information from the GeekList, or if he's also "in the know".  For example, he's already reviewed an upcoming Z-man release called Ninjato, which is being "pre-released" at GenCon with only 50 copies available.  So maybe he's got access to games/information that the general public doesn't.  I also know that he's quite fond of this LotR game, based on his praise in the review he did for it.

Hunt for Gollum is not in the Czech republic either. And I am getting rather angry as the retailer site still says first half of July, nice update guys.

What is the best place to get Carrok fast to Irland? Any clues?

 In the US I pre-ordered the Hunt for Gollum from Barnes and Noble on June 27th. It still has not shipped, and they are showing a expected ship date of August 10th. I think I need a better way to get cards.

 amazon.com has them in stock, as do various sellers on there.

i ordered mine from amazon and it arrived the 21st of july.

i've also pre-ordered all the other expansions from them, as well.

Here in Sweden HfG arrived last Friday (Jul 29) and was sold out almost everywhere at once.

I bought the last pack in town yesterday (Aug 1)... lucky me. Out of the three retailers (in my City) here that carry the item all of them are out of stock now.

I preordered it on Amazon.jp one month ago and two weeks ago they sent me an email to tell me that they don't know when it will be available.

As for Amazon.com, they have it only through marketplace now.

 

## 23 [Klaen on August 2, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/50731-release-date-for-carrock/?do=findComment&comment=507469)

Have my 'Hunt for Gollum' pre-ordered with milsims.com.au (A Victorian based games distributor - for those Aussies here). As they have only just received their second print run of the core set (something which was available in the states nearly 3 weeks ago) I imagine Gollum will be another 2 weeks before local distributors have it here. I too am a bit annoyed now, as I was hoping FFG would have shipped some copies over via air-freight to large Australian distributors.

I would have purchased mine from Amazon.com (where I got my core sets) but postage has sky-rocketed in the past few months and thus I have elected to keep my money in Australia rather than in the hands of greedy American online companies...

In Germany there is an odd situation: HfG was released on 19th July and a few stores in fact had it on that day. Most other shops got it on 21th July. What's weird is that amazon.de never had HfG in stock and dont even has listed all the other German expansion packs (?!?). HfG is being sold via amazon marketplace by various smaller fantasy stores. Large online retailers were sold out on HfG by the end of July.

Cool, sound worth a try at least. How long would you say the shipping normally takes? Any dates or availability information about the next adventure pack yet?

The German publisher renewed today its announcement - the 4th August is still the release date for Carrock

(they even claim that it has been released today and that it will be in stores on 4th August)

So it really seems that it will come this week (dont know if the overall retail problems everyone is suffering from will vanish though)

Where did you buy it? And could you give me some examples of retailers that had it?

 as LOTR:TCG is my first FFG product (soon to be followed by SW...my grad school restricted budget won't be happy!)...is seems odd to me that retailers are saying this releases 2 days from today and FFG has been mum on the subject.

does FFG typically have "surprise" releases like this for their other games? or could it be GenCon is somehow the culprit?

Both the Carrock and Osgiliath quest were added to the Quest Log today; so apparently they will see action at GenCon.

Good eye clyde! You should have no problem hunting down Gollum with those ranger senses of yours.

## 31 [Shelfwear on August 2, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/50731-release-date-for-carrock/?do=findComment&comment=507781)

Good find!

Conflict at the Carrock uses following encounter cards: Journey Down the Anduin, Wilderlands (Hill Trolls!) and Conflict at the Carrock

Massing at Osgiliath uses only its own encounter cards (!?!). Considering that PoD-Packs (Death Angel) so far had only 18 cards that makes quite a slim encounter deck...

As there are no other quests included in the quest log there most prolly wont be any other expansion packs introduced at Gen Con I guess...

Has there been an announced limit on the number of cards that will be in any POD set? Not sure you can make a deduction from what Death Angel had and what M@O will have.

## 33 [Shelfwear on August 2, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/50731-release-date-for-carrock/?do=findComment&comment=507868)

It's just my assumption, there are just two PoD sets released so far, both have around 18 cards. Really dont know how much MaO will have but after deducting 3 (?) quest cards and maybe one rule card (?) there wont too many cards left. I guess it will have less than 30 cards in total, thats just a gut feeling (considering the fact that a normal expansion set contains 29 encounter cards).

Good point(s). I would wager that if this is truly the only Encounter deck set for M@O (i.e. the Quest Log isn't incorrect)...these must be some killer encounter cards! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Slight derail here, but for those of you that have picked up a copy, does the scenario seem complete with just the included quest/encounter cards?

I ask because (and I don't know for certain, not having seen the cards myself), it seems like FFG forgot to print "if the players complete this stage of the quest, they have won the game" on the quest card 2B.

There's a similar thread about this on BGG, but I figure I may as well ask here now that more and more people have gotten their hands on this, and by now people have had some opportunities to play through the quest.  Thanks in advance!

Card numbers are ok, nothing is missing.

Well, stage 2b actually takes one travel token to complete it, so beyond defeating the trolls you have to quest successfully once.  I got mine today at my FLGS.  Couldn't believe it was in already!  Looks tough.

There isn't a 3a/b in Carrock.  So 2a/b finishes the game.

Amazon says Carrock will be released Aug. 30, but you can pre-order now.



*sigh* For the umpteenth time: Amazon is utterly clueless regarding release dates of games!

I don't think I've ever seen a correct release date there.

Have any actual shops in the UK got it in as yet? I mean physical stores not ebay or online only ones.

Waylands Forge in Birmingham haven't had it yet.

In Germany its not easier either (I'm talking about the German edition), it has been published but distribution seems few and sporadic. I couldnt get a copy via internet (amazon never offered the adventure packs and the big online stores went directly from pre-order to out of stock status) and my local store hasnt received any yet (and they dont know why and when). I had to travel to another city and had them to set aside one copy for me beforehand, so I got the last available one. Five days after official release all the few stores that got it seem to sold out on Carrock...

I guess we'll soon hear that the forces of Sauron are at work again against FFG. At least the adventure pack is now "officially" annouced as being on sale... only took them a week... even if it was GenCon, one would think they could update their website at a distance...
