The encounter card "crebain" states that "while crebain is in the staging area, encounter card effects cannot be cancelled".

Does this effect pertain to when encounter cards are used as shadow cards as well?

Or does the act of placing them as shadow cards change the nature of the card so it is merely labelled a shadow card and is no longer an encounter card per se?

No, this would not apply to shadow cards. Their effects could be cancelled.

Shadow effects are on encounter cards. So there effect is an encounter card effect. 

Same as hero cards are also player cards.

 

If the back of the card shows a ring: player card

If the back of the card shows an eye: encounter card

Yes, I think that you are right, Muemakan: a shadow card is an encounter card after all, so, it cannot be cancelled in the situation described before.

If it really is so, I apologize for a wrong post. However, I still feel the same, I think shadow effects are a different category. Is there a link to a previous official answer?

See page 23 of the rule book. Bold emphasis added.

Card Effects
There are several kinds of card effects in The Lord of
the Rings: The Card Game. On the hero and player
cards, card effects fall into one of 5 categories:
constant effects, actions, responses, forced effects,
and keywords. On the cards found in the quest
and encounter decks, card effects fall into one of
6 categories: constant effects, forced effects, when
revealed effects, shadow effects, travel effects, and
keywords.

Yes [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efpag=1&efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=598567]. The question came up because of the Eaves of Mirkwood card. Answer from Nate French: Shadow card effects are not encounter card effects.

I thought as much. But I began to think I was just dreaming it. I think this makes sense though, at least it feels natural - not that such feelings have much merit in games.

 Sorry but that sucks big time. If we cannot even have such fundamental rules. An effect on an encounter card should be an "encounter card effect".

Did they think anything through before the made this rules.

 ARGHHHHHHHHHHH

So to sum it up. Heroes are player cards but shadow cards are not encounter cards. Makes total sense...........BÄHH

 Well, there may be yet a case where "shadow cards" are deemed to be "encounter cards".  We just haven't seen it yet.  What we *have* seen, is that "shadow card effects" are not "encounter card effects".

I agree that the shadow effect is printed on an encounter card.  But the shadow effect is not an encounter card effect.

I know it's frustrating, but the CoC and the AGoT rules have gone through 7 years or so of updates and revisions.  M:tG's rules have evolved similarly.  Give this game time, it'll get there.  (Although I'm still waiting for my **** timing chart...)

Yes, me too. And for a clarification on some terms, e.g. if "killed" "eliminated"  "destroyed" are the same, and so on gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]
