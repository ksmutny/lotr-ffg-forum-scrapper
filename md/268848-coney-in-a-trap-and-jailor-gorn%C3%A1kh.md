Greetings guys,

A question popped up in our game group, is it possible to answer with Coney in a Trap to the Jailor Gornákh forced effect?

The forced effect is done sentence by sentence, so before you have a chance to respond to the engagement he has already started attacking.

Agree with dale.  Even if it said "Forced: After <this enemy> engages you, it makes an immediate attack," you would not be able to avoid the attack with Coney in a Trap.  The Jailor's Forced effect, and the Forced effect that I hypothesized just now, would have to trigger before you can trigger Coney in a Trap.  Once the attack has begun, you can't cancel it (you can only prevent further attacks--- so, for example, if he got a shadow effect that caused a 2nd attack, that attack would be prevented).

Well, for immediate attacks, isn't there an action window after initiating the attack that you could use to play this card? I suppose the attack is already in process and would not be cancelled, though.

That's my understanding.  You could play the card, but it wouldn't effect the current attack.

Playing the card would at least prevent Gornakh from attacking again in the combat phase, since its effect lasts all round.
