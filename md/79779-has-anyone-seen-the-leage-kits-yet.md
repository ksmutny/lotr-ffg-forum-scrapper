I've heard they are available to distributors but my store is being told they are not available.Â  Anyone?

I talked to my FLGS in San Rafael, CA and they said that there was a delay in sending them out but he reported that they were shipping sometime this week, so it should be soon. I think FFG posted an article saying there was some delay.

my store also said they should be getting them this week.
