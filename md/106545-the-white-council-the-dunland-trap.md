What do you think the card, "The White Council" which has been spoiled for the Dunland trap will do?

 

We already know it costs X (X is the number of players in the game) and reads:
"Action: Starting with the first player, each player chooses 1 different option: ready a hero he controls....."

 

I'm pretty sure it then reads, "add 1 resource to the resource pool of a hero he controls" (more than 1 would be too good I reckon)

 

There will obviously be two other options as in a four player game each player needs to be able to choose a different option. What do you think these could be?

I personally think 1 will be "Draw one card" (especially as there does not appear to be much space for the text of the fourth option..) but can't really guess what the other might be.... I was thinking maybe "heal up to 2 damage from a hero he controls" 

That would even be handy in solo for 1 neutral resource to be able to heal some damage that you need to get rid of. I'm not so sure it will be this however, as it seems a bit random and not quite as thematic as readying a hero, gaining resource or drawing a card (then again Elrond is on the white council and is a renowned healer....).

 

Any ideas on what the two unrevealed options might be?
Also is anyone as excited at how good this card may be? I for one am very excited to use the readying and resource abilities (especially for first turn steward of gondor) as well as whatever the other two might be!

Why are you so sure about the number of options?

Ready, resource... Then card draw I think is for sure, maybe threat reduction or adding willpower to a character?

While playing trisphere solo I have a huge appreciation for core Gandalf. Choices are super powerful and let cards become much more versatile.

Because it says different option, not just option.

I can see the word "from" on the preview, so I'll assume that it discard 1 condition from the character player controls.

Hadn't thought of this!! That would be awesome... I would instantly run three copies of it (probably going to anyway) and probably take power of orthanc out of my sideboard too.

Reducing threat would be good, how much do you think it would be? 3?

We definitely need more condition removal. Lets hope you're right. Especially because its neutral.

2 or 3 would be appropriate for the 1 resource cost of that players benefit. No more than that though.

Discard may be for a Shadow card, too. Ready, money, draw, shadow -- could be just the thing.
