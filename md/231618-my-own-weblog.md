Here is an image:

As you can see, i'm still working on it.

It is for my personal use, i won't public it. I want to log all my quests with all the avalaible heroes (and stop waiting more than 1 year for logging something with Damrod, for example).

I'm learning php, i will end this weblog not fast. However i like it.

 

As i said, it is for my own use. In fact, ringsdb is working on a amazing weblog. I'm waiting for it, however im logging my scores on my personal weblog because i'd rather on it instead on post-its papers.

 

I open this thread because i'm satisfied about my php knowledges ^^. But i know i dont have enough knowledges to build a professional weblog public, for example, about security ways. Php is weak in that theme, and i know i am not a professional about it, a easy hacker could ruin my database, and people that trust me could become frustrated. I prefer it for my personal localhost.

You can learn php, css, javascript+jquery, ajax and html all by yourself and making a pretty decent job in the end, so keep it up.

Something that starts as a tool you find useful for yourself in the first place is bound to be useful for someone else.

It just needs some html work, but php (the most hard) is ended yet.

 

Going for.... mmmmmh, let's go to compare different players' score!

I return to say: design is not the main important, it is the php. When all the program will be developed, i will do a better design with html, it is not hard to me.

PHP runs now as you can see! ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

Next step is to work about login system and security, lets go!

I forgot this section, working on it:

I have added some filters (mode and number of players), and you can order the games by date-played, score or date-logged, by ascendant or descendant order.

And avatars system when logging!:

I'm thinking about: when a user choses an avatar, people that registers after, can't chose that repeated, unless the first one change of avatar. Could be fun ^^
