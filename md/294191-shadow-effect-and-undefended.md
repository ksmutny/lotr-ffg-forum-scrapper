Hello guys !

I have a question for you.

The card "Merchant's District" of "The Battle of Lake-Town" has theÂ shadow effect : "Deal 1 damage on Lake-Town. (4 damage instead if undefended.)"

But, for a player to defend against an enemy engaged in combat with us (with sentinel),Â we must declare thisÂ attack undefended.

So, does the Lake-TownÂ take 4 damage or just 1 ?

Even though before the other player can use the sentinel character you have to decide to declare no defenders the sentinel character it's still declared later on as a defender against that enemy so the attack itself is not considered undefended.
