Wow. Can't believe it, but they managed to make the latest LOTR LCG news article more boring than I could've imagined.

Has anyone tried this quest solo?  Does it even work?

I have, but it's not the best experience solo. You definitely need power decks to beat it solo, and you're missing a ton of the experience.

Beat it with the Boromir Fire and Blood deck. There's a solo mode so it works fine.

When I played this at the Fellowship Event I don't think the Lieutenant of Angmar every came to my group's quest stage, and I didn't really look at the pack afterwards. Didn't realize how great his art was!

Man sometimes it's really frustrating when the developer of your fravourite game sits in the USA and you're sitting at home waiting for someone to finally translate (because the prices for the english versions at the store of your choice are double of what you pay for the german Version. And if you want to pick up some NM quests you have no choice as they don't seem to get translated anymore :unsure: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_unsure.png]) and publish the **** thing^^

But at least we get localized versions :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

It's quite fun in solo, I think. Some ennemies are super tough, it can be challenging.

I've played once (at the actual Fellowship event) in epic mode and we got our arses kicked. Some stages seemed tougher than others.

It works solo. Pretty hard quest though, I haven't been able to beat it yet. But I have only tried a few times so far. The enemies are really tough but you do get a few turns to build up first.

Finally, we get a new pack, an epic pack.

How does it compare to Belegost?

They do, but with english packs.

They're pretty similar in difficulty, if you ask me; I haven't managed a win on Belegost yet either. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] My gut tells me that Annuminas is a little easier, actually, but I don't have any wins to back that up.

Still better than what passes for our inept FLGS (in the loosest meaning of the term), that already has them for several weeks, yet was unable to organize something until we offered to do it ourselves. At least we'll play it next Wednesday.

Time to play 12 handed for a solo player like me?

Hm...I wonder if I can get 12 viable decks while maintaining uniqueness across all of them (I know it's not actually required to do it that way, but it may be an interesting challenge).  Also, is my entire apartment even large enough to set up three four-deck games simultaneously (I know my table starts running out of space just with a single two-deck game!)?

To make it even harder, I have only one core set. Only 2 games can have a single copy of a Test of Will.

When this quest was announced I did some brainstorming in a deck-building thread about retaining uniqueness across the heroes.  If you do themed groups like I was aiming for, then unique allies are less of an issue and it really comes to unique attachments causing the most challenge to the build.  If you are the only one with cards, the real issue will be simply not having enough cards to make 12 good decks filled with mostly non-unique stuff.

Team 1 & 2 gets 1x Test of Will.  Team 3 gets Eleanor.

Lay cards out on the floor!

That's why I'm wondering if I have enough floor space!  XD

It might make it prone to forget things, but you can reduce the foot print required by stacking cards.  Such as, just stack all your questing allies into a pile with a dice on top indicating how much WP they are committing. You could even do this with all the questing allies for a given group of 4 decks, just add a slip sheet or something to make sure you keep it divided by which "player" controls those particular allies.  Stack any enemies into a pile with just their threat showing, same with locations.

At least you will have the chance to play this. We in Germany will like not have that opportunity unless someone buys the English PoD's and runs a privat event (which still would miss the german version and the fellowship goodies). It's really frustrating because we still muss Belegost as PoD in german so Annuminas even as PoD seems a long time away (or more like "not gonna happen"). :unsure: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_unsure.png]

Took a few tries but I beat it pure solo.  I agree it's not as hard as Belegost, partially because you can get lucky and not really have to face anything too bad until the end when you are hopefully prepared.

I will have it on Monday and plan to play this thematically with a Dunedain deck ... can't wait

Good luck! I tried using a Dunedain deck against this the first time I played it, but it didn't do too well since you really don't want to let enemies stick around too long since they damage the city.

Maintain uniqueness across the table and get only three cards of each around the whole table is not the same. You can make home proxy of some cards you own to your personal use and use them to build more deck. I can build this 12 decks challenge pretty easily with this restriction. The most problematic part will be boromir hero, galadriel hero, Arwen (hero and ally), Amarthuil hero and of course Glorfindel (hero and ally). And steward of Gondor.

But even without duplicating cards among decks it seem clearly possible because you have a lot of strategic where the main cards are different (all tribal decks, Caldara, Elrond, secret, Boromir core, Gimli&Legolas, hàma.deck, mono lore loot) but it can be hard to win. If using all cards and unfair strategy I'm sure I can build deck who will win :).

But in fact I will just need 6 decks because I will probably play this scenario with 3 tables of 2 players.

I hope this scenario will be soon available in french too. I think I will buy one in english and then one more in french when it get released.

finally got a copy delivered yesterday. Not sure when i'll get to try it, though, as i've been too busy to play of late - I've only managed to play race across harad once so far, and lost, so I don't want to move on to another quest until i've had time to go back and beat it.

Have a question. In quest stage 3B there is a response ... if I am playing solo one hand, how do I play the response?

Since there are no other stages you ignore it.  (It's a response, which is optional.)
