After playing quite a few games in solo, I wanted to build an accompanying deck. 


I would like to try some more two handed and I will be introducing a friend to this game.


So even though more power is always nice, it is important that the mechanics are not too overly complicated.


 


The first deck..


 


Heroes.


- Elrond


- Beravor


- Glorfindel


 


Allies.


- Gildor Inglorion x2


- Master of the Forge x3


- Henamarth Riversong x2


- Warden of Healing x2


- Haldir of Lorien


- Mirkwood Runner


- Silvan Tracker


- Gleowine


- Imladris Stargazer x3


- Lorien Guide


- Arwen Undomiel


- Erestor


- Beorn x2


- Gandalf x2


 


Events.


- Daeron's Runes x3


- Word of Command x2


- A Test of Will x2


- The Galadhrim's Greeting x3


- Elrond's Counsel x3


 


Attachments.


- Elf-stone x3


- Self Preservation


- Protector of Lorien


- A Burning Brand


- Asfaloth


- Unexpected Courage x2


- Light of Valinor x3


- Resourceful x2


- Vilya x3


 


And the second deck..


 


Heroes.


- Legolas


- Elladan


- Elrohir


 


Allies.


- Landroval


- Eagles of the Misty Mountains x3


- Vassal of the Windlord x3


- Winged Guardian x3


- Faramir x2


- Gandalf x2


- Radagast x2


 


Events.


- Feint x3


- Quick Strike x3


- Hands Upon the Bow x3


- The Eagles Are Coming! x3


- Stand Together x2


- Unseen Strike x2


- Sneak Attack x3


- Valiant Sacrifice x2


 


Attachments.


- Support of the Eagles x2


- Horn of Gondor x2


- Rivendell Blade x3


- Celebrian's Stone x2


- Steward of Gondor x3


 


So my idea is to play with the first deck as support and let my friend play with the second deck, which is mostly based on attacking and defending, which I think will be a very persuasive element for him.


Further I tried to include mostly Elves, some recognizable friends and Eagles.

This is the deck I used to use (two handed alongside a spirit/lore deck so very similar to your setup!) with the same three heroes before I took Legolas out and replaced him with a second Leadership hero (first Celeborn and now currently Sam).

Pretty different from yours and focuses on attachments more so than eagles and events like your deck. It also uses Gondorian Shield, Steward and Elven Mail (or Arwen) to turn Elrohir into a super defender rather than Support of the Eagles. 

 

Heroes:
Legolas - 9
Elladan - 10
Elrohir – 10
 
Starting threat – 29
 
Allies: (19)
 
3x - Gandalf (Core)
3x - Envoy of Pelargir
3x - Naith Guide
3x - Gondorian Spearman
3x - Galadhon Archer
1x - Faramir
1x - Boromir
2x - Galadriel
1x - Erestor
 
Attachments: (22)
2x - Rivendell Bow
3x - Steward of Gondor
3x - Gondorian Shield
3x - Rivendell Blade
3x - Bow of the Galadhrim
3x - Dunedain Mark
3x - Elven Mail
1x - O Lorien
 
Events: (9)
3x - Feint
3x - Sneak Attack
3x - Feigned Voices
 
My deck focuses on Steward a little too much though and without it the high cost leadership allies cannot be played. Other than that though it was quite a powerful combat oriented deck (not as good as the new version with Sam however!). With yours I would definitely cut down on events a little, you probably don't need 3 copies of quick strike AND hands upon the bow. I would just go with Hands Upon the Bow and maybe even drop quick strike altogether. I would also drop unseen strike as I have never been a fan of it unless you are running secrecy or a deck that will be able to take advantage of it late game as well as early. Do you really get much use out of Stand Together either? I would think that with Support of the Eagles this wouldn't really be necessary. Do you put Steward on Elrohir or another hero? If you put it on him I would definitely put a few copies of Gondorian Shield for any times that Support of the Eagles does not show up or does not provide as much as you want it to. If you put Steward on Elrohir I also recommend Naith Guide which I think is one of the best allies in the game. 
Definitely recommend a few more weapon attachments or even Dunedain Mark to supplement Support of the Eagles. 
With two tactics heroes I think Boromir and Rumil allies are also worth considering. Same goes for Galadhon Archer really. 
Also if you include Galadhon Archers or Naith Guides you could also include Feigned Voices.
Hope my suggestions help =) Sorry they are so "move away from eagles include more attachments and elves" oriented  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]
I used eagles way too much and too long when I first got the game and got super over them, I just think there are better and more powerful options for tactics/combat decks.

Thanks! No problem at all about the suggestions.

Although I have never heard of half of the cards you mention, I will definitely look into these suggestions!

Even though I have almost every expansion up to date, I haven't opened all of them since I wanted to expand my card pool a bit slowly.
