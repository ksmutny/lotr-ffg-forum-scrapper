Hi all,

I just posted my version of the urban dictionary for this game on Vision of the Palantir. This lists a great number of terms and abbreviations that can be useful for new players to understand our lingo. https://visionofthepalantir.com/2018/07/14/lotr-lcg-urban-dictionary/ [https://visionofthepalantir.com/2018/07/14/lotr-lcg-urban-dictionary/]

If you have any additions to the list, feel free to let me know and I will update the list accordingly. Hope this helps a lot of new players and can put a smile on the face of more experienced players.

As for the rest of the blog, I am still working my way through the Ringmaker cycle, but with added support from co-authors, I am steadily pumping out more content like this. You can find ways to support us via the blog.

I like that you refer to Caldara's errata as a "patch."

I think "nerf" would be a better word than "patch", but I'm not a big errata fan.

Noticed you had some cotr references

 Spideresque: having qualities similar to spiders.  Only applies when talking about spider enemies
