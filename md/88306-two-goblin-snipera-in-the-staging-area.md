When there are two goblin snipers in the staging area is it imposible for me to engage one? I think so but i am not sure anyone has any ideas?

For solo, i think you are stuck, unless you can attack the staging area somehow.

2 damage to heroes every round until they are all dead.  It happened to me once.
