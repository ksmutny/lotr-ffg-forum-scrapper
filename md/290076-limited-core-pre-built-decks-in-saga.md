Hello, Its looking to be a very cold weekend here (sub -40 weather) and the girlfriend and I are planning on just hanging out, and watching lord of the rings and playing the game. Shes not much of a deck builder and I hate having to rebuild decks for specific quests (especially because progression and saga are kind of weird). I have the limited core though, would those decks have an ok chance of doing the saga?

Â 

Cheers

By "limited core", do you mean the 30-card monosphere decks that come with a core set, or the pre-built decks that come with the Limited Starter Edition?

If you mean the Limited Edition Starter, I would give a strong no. They are well suited for the quests in that box, and some of the easier quests farther along, but it would take a very experienced player to take them through the saga. They also really wouldn't provide the best experience for that group of quests.
