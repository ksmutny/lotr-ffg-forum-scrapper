So I recently picked up The Mumakil, and I have a question about Firyal. She says "After Firyal commits to the quest look at the top card of the encounter deck. Then you may discard the looked at card." While i'm committing characters to the quest, do I commit them one by one? If so then Firyal can commit first and act like a pseudo Henamarth. Even if this doesn't work, in multiplayer if you are the first player, you would commit all your characters, trigger her response, and then are able to advise your partner on how to quest right?

You commit all your characters at the same time. But yes, in multiplayer you could use the knowledge of the top card to advise everyone after you in the player order.

? So you trigger Firyal's response after you have committed all characters you want to send to the quest? I always thought Firyal's response could be triggered before deciding whether to commit more characters or not

PocketWraith has it right.  Friyal provides at least three benefits still:

1.  Can help people in multiplayer decide how to quest

2.  Can give you the opportunity to put a nasty card into the discard pile

3.  Can give you the knowledge that you need to trigger an action before proceeding to the staging step (such as healing a character maybe).

Actually she provides one other benefit which is that if you have other responses when you commit to the quest, such as ally Arwen, you have a better idea where they should go.
