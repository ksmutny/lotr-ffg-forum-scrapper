# [What is the highest possible theoretical willpower you can attain for the first turn quest phase?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/219791-what-is-the-highest-possible-theoretical-willpower-you-can-attain-for-the-first-turn-quest-phase/)

## 1 [cmabr002 on May 12, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/219791-what-is-the-highest-possible-theoretical-willpower-you-can-attain-for-the-first-turn-quest-phase/?do=findComment&comment=2214213)

Try to get the highest willpower for the two types of modes

 

Mode 1: You can only use your starting hand + your starting draw (7 cards - this is a hard limit.  No hero abilities, such as Erestor, will allow more draws).  You may not draw more cards/manipulate your deck.

Mode 2: You can use any player cards to manipulate your deck/hand/draws and draw more than your starting hand+initial draw.

 

1) You are only using one deck

2) You are using willpower for questing (not battle/siege)

3) You can only benefit from player card effects

4) You may not included any objective allies or extra heroes (from sagas etc) in the calculation for your willpower

5) Try not to come up with any other gimmicky things I've not thought of that would give you an unfair starting advantage to your willpower and haven't thought to list in these rules as disallowed

6) You can choose your draw(s) when applicable

7) You are playing regular mode (not easy mode)

 

Currently, Seastan has a very impressive 36 Willpower for Mode 1, but I won't divulge how he did it in case any players want to try to top it...

If I'm doing my math right, I think at least 38 is possible:

 

Aragorn (Leadership)
Hirluin the Fair
Erestor
 
Legacy of Numenor
Legacy of Numenor
Legacy of Numenor
Ethir Swordsman 
Ethir Swordsman 
Ethir Swordsman 
Sword that was broken
A Good Harvest (name spirit)
Hunter of Lamedon
Faramir
 
All Outlands characters quest for 6 each, Erestor and Aragorn quest for 4 each.
 
Edit: oops, did not see Erestor restriction

That's 15 resources worth of cards, but you only have 12 resources.

I can get up to 20 in a scenario that I can actually imagine occurring in-game:

 

Heroes: Arwen, Theoden (S), Eowyn

 

Play Astonishing Speed (3 resources). Discard a card for a resource, use this and Theoden's discount to play Escort From Edoras. Discard a card to boost Eowyn. This gets you:

Arwen (3) + Theoden (4) + Eowyn (7) + Escort (6) = 20 willpower.

 

You could increase this to 23 by playing 3x Elrond's Council, which uses all resources and your entire opening hand of 6+1 cards. Seems a bit less likely to me.

Wow! Nice.  I hadn't thought of this avenue before.  It looks like it can be Improved a bit...I'm sure it can still be improved even more, but here's a slightly higher amount using the same idea.

 

Frodo, Theoden, Eowyn

 

3x Good Meal

3x Astonishing Speed

1x Westfold Horsebreeder

 

Frodo (2), Theoden (8), Eowyn (10), Westfold Horsebreeder (7) = 27

So there is also...mostly thanks to Seastan

 

3x Legacy of Numenor

3x Astonishing Speed

1x Eothian

 

Theodred

Eowyn

Theoden

 

Erkenbrand (7), Eowyn (10), Theoden (8), Eothian (8) = 33

I didn't think of good meal, great idea!

 

Another approach (with only the starting hand - if you could draw more cards this could quickly become crazy) uses the first round potential of the new Denthor hero.

 

Heroes: Cirdan, Eowyn, Denethor (L)

 

Play a Legacy of Numenor for the extra resources. You now have enough to play Galadriel (L), who finds Celebrian's Stone, and also two Escort from Edoras. Sneak attack in Faramir, and then play Ever Vigilant to get two uses out of him during the quest phase. This gets you 34:

 

Cirdan (4) + Eowyn (4) + Denethor (1) + Celbrian's Stone (2) + Escort 1 (4) + Escort 2 (4) + Galadriel (3) +Faramir use 1 (6) + Faramir use 2 (6) = 34!

 

I'm sure this can be improved on as well - certainly with more draws of Ever Vigilant, or possibly by substituting in Aragorn somewhere and having Galadriel draw Sword that was Broken. At any rate, it is within striking distance of Seastan's answer.

You can actually get 35 with Rohan a 2 different ways...

 

2x Legacy

2x Astonishing Speed

1x Escort from Edoras

2x Snowborn Scout

 

3x Legacy

2x Astonishing Speed

2x Escort from Edoras

No.  There is a 32 solution that we've come up with if we allow Trained for War as well.  And there is a 40 solution if we allow the tactics battle side quest.  I'm not sure how those should be considered sine this is a fairly casual exercise :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

 

I imagine with Tactics Eowyn and Grappling hook, you can get quite high.

When Temple of the Deceived gets released Scouting Party is going to blow this up. You can get to 35+(whatever willpower the hero in that pack has).

This solution becomes 36 if we replace 1x Snowborn Scout with Ceorl (the unreleased Rohan ally). 

 

This was not the 36 solution Seastan came up with.  At this point we may as well reveal his 36 solution...

 

Denethor

Theodred

Eowyn (S)

 

3 2x Legacy of Numenor

3x Lay of Nimrodel

2x Parting Gifts

That's 8 cards! It should only be 2 Legacy.

It's possible to quest with 69 willpower on a first turn.

I think you can get 39 willpower if you tweak Seastan's a little bit to replace Theodred with Cirdan, and one of the parting gifts with another legacy of Numenor. One spirit hero will pay for the Lay of Nimrodels on the other spirit hero that receives all of Denethor's resources.

Interesting thread .. but mostly in exchange for 12 threat .. uff.. so after round 1 you have finished the first quest card, all characters are exhausted and your threat is nearly 40 ..

Heroes:

 

Dain, Thorin, Aragorn (L)

 

Opening Hand plus draw: 

 

Fili

A Very Good Tale

A Very Good Tale

A Very Good Tale

Legacy of Numenor

We are not Idle

Sword that was Broken

 

Play order:

 

Play Legacy of Numenor, you now have 6 L resources. Play Sword that was Broken on Aragorn (now 3 L resources). Play Fili and grab Kili (now 0 resources). Exhaust both for A  Very Good Tale, grabbing 2x Longbeard Elders. Exhaust the Elders for second A Very Good Tale, grabbing Gloin and Bofur. Exhaust Gloin and Bofur for a third Elder and Bifur. Play We are not Idle, exhausting the ready Elder, Bifur, Dain and Thorin to put 4 resources on Dain. Draw Lure of Moria. Play Lure of Moria to ready all dwarves. Quest with everyone except Dain.

 



Total:

 

Thorin (5) + Aragorn (3) + {Fili, Kili, Longbeard Elders x 3, Gloin, Bofur, Bifur} (4 each = 32) = 40

Nice! I didn't think of that. I think I can tie 39 with:

 

Cirdan, Eowyn, Denerthor, Legacy x 2, Parting Gifts, Lay of Nimrodel x 3, Dwarven Tomb.

 

To go for the highest questing strength, rather than straight willpower, you can get to 40 with:

 

Tactics Eowyn, Treebeard, Amarthiul, 3x Dunedain hunter, Vassal of the Windlord, Sneak Attack, Beorn Ally, and Delay the Enemy.

Aren't Fili, Kili, and Bifur all 1 base WP, as opposed to the Elders/Gloin/Bofur with 2 base WP? Which would make your total 37.

 

Anyway, the others have gotten even the non-draw version up to 39, so I'm sure even the following improvement can be much bettered, but if you do two things:

 

- Have ally Galadriel in hand instead of Sword that was Broken, and put StwB into play via Galadriel's effect.

- Replace the allies put into play by the last Very Good Tale with Faramir and, say, Erebor Hammersmith, then you can exhaust the Erebor Hammersmith, Dain, and Thorin to put 3 resources on Dain with We Are Not Idle, draw and play Lure of Moria, quest with everyone except Dain and Faramir, then trigger Faramir.

 

...then you get:

 

Thorin (6) + Aragorn (4) + (Elders x2, Gloin, Bofur) (4*5) + (Fili, Kili, Erebor Hammersmith) (3*4) + Galadriel (5) = 47.

@sappidus: Good point, and nice improvement. Nobody had done a dwarf version yet (or really any Mode 2's), so I thought I'd throw out an option. Figured there were probably ways to improve it -- as you point out!

Dwarfs are so impressive. But the Scout trait can lead to some intersting results.

 

 

With the new Leadership scout hero from The Temple of the decieved, you can achieve a 36 willpower at first quest phase (and maybe more 38)

 

Idraen scout

Lanwyn scout

New Leadership scout

 

Starting hand:

 

3 Scouting Party

2 Lecacy of Numenor

1 Snowbourn Scout

1 Naith Guide

 

 

2 legacy --> 3 Leadership resources and 6 spirit resources

 

Then play the Snowbourn Scout and the Naith Guide. --> 0 Leadership resource and 6 spirit resources

 

Then commit to quest the 5 characters. (2+2+?(at least 1 for the new scout hero)+1+0)->6 willpower.

 

Then play the 3 scouting party. 2*5*3 =>+30 willpower bonus.

If a surge is revealed during the quest phase, you quest to 38, not so bad with 3 heroes with a 2 or less willpower.

I think I can get to 53 willpower with no draws. It involves the deck, but it doesn't require the deck to be in any specific order or anything, so I think it should belong in Mode 1, but let me know if you think otherwise.

 

Theoden, Cirdan, Thorin (Starting threat 36).

 

7 Cards: Legacy of Numenor, Rallying Cry, Emery, 2x Will of the West, 2x Lay of Nimrodel.

 

Somewhere in your deck: 3x Hidden Cache, 3x Lord's of the Eldar, and 3x of every Leadership, Tactics, and Lore card, making the probability of 3 spirit/neutral cards appearing in a row essentially 0.

 

Method: Play Legacy of Numenor and get to 40 threat. Then play Rallying Cry (valour action). Play Emery over and over, milling your deck. When you burn through your 3 Hidden Cache's, put all 6 of the resources on Cirdan. Play 2x Will of the West with Theoden's resources. Mill your deck 2 more times. Put 12 more resources on Cirdan. Cirdan now has 20 resources. At the start of the quest phase, play your 2 Lay of Nimrodel, giving Cirdan 19+18=37 bonus willpower. Play the 3x Lords of the Eldar from your discard. Then play Emery a final time, keeping her in play thanks to the 3 Lords of the Eldar now in your deck. Cirdan now has 9 resources left so play your 3 Lords of the Eldar again.

 

Total Willpower:

 

Theoden (2), Thorin (3), Cirdan (4+37+6), Emery(1) = 53

 

Let me know if you can think of a way to improve it!

 

Edit: Fixed from a previous version involving Glorfindel ally which didn't work.

This is awesome, and I especially like how the main point of Thorin is to have heroes with high enough threat that you can jump into Valour mode easily.

Well Thorin gives the crucial access to leadership too.  Theoden is really clunky.  It's too bad Arwen hero isn't 12 threat haha...then she would get the boost from Lords of the Eldar too.

You might be right, I guess he follows the same runes as playing regular allies.

 

If so, then the corrected willpower would be 53. (You lose the 7 from Glorfindel but you can play Lords 2 more times).

Yeah, my point was that Thorin's ability or even his dwarfitude is irrelevant in this case. He's just the only Leadership hero whose threat is high enough -- except Aragorn, who quests for 1 less.

We can optimize it a bit by replacing Theoden with Arwen, and Legacy of Numenor with The Seeing Stone. Use The Seeing Stone to fetch The Seeing Stone, to fetch The Seeing Stone, to fetch Legacy of Numenor. Now your threat is 40, and you can proceed as before.

 

Arwen has +1 base willpower, plus she benefits from Lords of the Eldar for another +6, so your new total is:

Arwen (3+6), Thorin (3), Cirdan (4+37+6), Emery (1) = 60

 

Bonus points if someone can figure out how to use Elven-Light to squeeze some more willpower out of this setup, or get another 2 Doomed so we can swap Thorin for Elrohir.

I haven't done the math, but you sort of need to make sure that your deck doesn't ever end up not being divisible by 3.  Otherwise, you get to a point where you need to discard the top 3 cards of your deck and if only one is left and it is Spirit or Neutral, Emery stays in play.  Alternatively, if you legally can't discard the bottom cards of your deck if it is not equal to three, then there is a chance that your Hidden Caches will be inaccessible, reducing the amount of willpower attained.

 

Sure, your starting deck can be divisible by 3, by choice, but once you start adding in things like Rallying Cry, Legacy of Numenor, then reshuffling with Will of the West, the amount of cards in your deck will be altered.  So that means if we play one card, we need to play 2 more.  Or if we play 2 cards, we need to play 1 more.

Brilliant addition with Seeing Stone!

Well, just use the appropriate number of cards to make sure it's divisible by 3 on the last time through your deck so that the Emery/Lords combo works. The odds of hidden cache being in the bottom 1 or 2 of your deck in the previous times through your 1000+ card deck are pretty negligible I's say.

It just depends on what is allowed.  Delay the enemy does make the quest "battle" which I guess technically would disobey rule #2.  Grappling hook doesn't disobey rule #2.  But yeah, this is pretty casual so it's not like it matters too much.  I was just trying to lay some sort of framework down ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]
