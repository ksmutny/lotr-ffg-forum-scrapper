Do you deal a shadow effect card every round of combat to an enemy you have engaged but have not killed. I thought the shadow effect was a form of surprise, but once you have engaged them the first round and have not yet killed them the element of surprise is gone during the next round of combat.

you discard shadow cards at the end of combat each round.

 

the next round, if the enemy is still engaged with you, yes, it gets another shadow card.

 

the element of surprise is always there, as there will always be a new shadow card for you to reveal.

I second that

 

A reference from the Rules of Play...

 

Shadow cards remain on the enemy to which they were dealt throughout the combat phase. If that enemy leaves play, discard it shadow card from play. At the end of the combat phase, discard all shadow cards that were dealt this round.

 

Also from the Errata...

 

At the end of the combat phase, discard each unresolved shadow card in play.
