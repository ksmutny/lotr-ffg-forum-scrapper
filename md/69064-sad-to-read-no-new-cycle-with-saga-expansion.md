Sad to read, no new cycle with "Saga" Expansion!

Cut From FFG Facebook

…
* Patrick Bergin "Well this is a "Saga" Expansion, not deluxe, so not necessarily. Furthermore, it remains to be seen whether there will be a related cycle following its release (a la Khazad-Dum/Dwarrowdelf) or not."

…


* Fantasy Flight Games "Patrick, there are currently no announced plans for a related cycle as with Khazad-Dum/Dwarrowdelf. And Matthew, it will be available at retailers on 8/17, as well as Gen Con. Thanks for the questions!"

interesting, but as others have pointed out:

Warhammer: 6 cycles, only 3 deluxe expansions

COC: 7 cycles, 3 deluxe expansions

AGOT: 8 deluxe (two for introducing new houses), 9 cycles

 

On top of that, there is no deluxe expansion between the current cycle of AGOT and the new cycle they just previewed coming out next.

So, it's really an incorrect assumption of the LOTR community to infer that the Core/Cycle/Deluxe/Cycle pattern is one that will hold. If their other games are any indication, this is not a set pattern and is subject to change.

As such, it seems like we are getting two saga expansions and then probably another deluxe after that or just a regular cycle that uses older encounter cards. Either way, unless there is an announcement at GenCon, we probably wont know much until after the release of the first Saga expansion.

When they say no "announced" plans, it makes me think they are maybe just keeping it secret for now. Wishful thinking?

It seems to me like releasing a cycle to correspond with the saga expansion would kind of contradict their initial explanation of the "saga expansion", especially if you go back and read the initial announcement for the Hobbit boxes.  But then again, if they don't do a cycle for the Hobbit I don't know what they will base a cycle off of for next year… Unless FFG has a ton of unannounced stuff up their sleeve

I think it is pretty clear this is 2. . (some said three but I am sure I read it was 2) .. anyway 2 stand alone expansions that create a self contained quest chain. I would be super surprised if we see a cycle as well, and equally surprised if we see the "hobbit" sphere ever again. This feel to me like a "board game" type expansion to pull players that own the core and are not avid collectors.

My guess is we will see a completely different unrelated cycle. Though it is my hope that the entire cycle monthly pack idea is dropped compleatly like they are doing in CoC and I think in the other LCGs

perhaps i should have added "as far as we know" -- FFG was clear in the COC article that the switch to every 4 months was only for COC but that doesn't mean they aren't planning it for anything else and might change other games. my guess is AGOT is too popular to switch and COC is only changing b/c it isn't selling well.

I know FFG said that, but it isn't true.  LotR is changing. The saga model is the same thing as CoC.  The question isn't whether or not LotR is changing, but if it will be changing back after the two Hobbit boxes are done.

yes, you are technically correct that LOTR is changing from the model we've had for the first year. but you are incorrect in saying it is changing to the COC model (given the statements by FFG). there is no link between COC and the saga expansion -- they are two different things (COC is the new release schedule, hobbit is a "special event"). for one, we don't even know that the two hobbit sets are 4 months apart from one another. additionally, the saga is a standalone product in many ways, a self contained story to capitalize on the movie, the COC releases are not.. the 4-month interval for COC is b/c of slowing sales.

however, the larger point is that no LCG has been consistent with a release schedule. sometimes there are deluxe expansions, sometimes there aren't. sometimes there are two cycles in a row, sometimes cycles are interrupted by deluxe expansions. now, COC is moving to releases every 4 months.

the hobbit expansion is something special. so, given that the article flat out said no other LCG is moving to 4 month intervals, i think we can somewhat safely infer the hobbit is just a special event and we'll return to our regularly scheduled programming after that.

one would think, if other LCGs were changing permanently to the 4-month model, the article would not have been explicit in mentioning that no other LCG title is changing to the 4-month interval.

Actually, I think claiming that " no LCG has been consistent with a release schedule" obfuscates the larger issue; that the LotR LCG looks to be going FAR longer between chapter packs than any of the other LCGS.

it's really fruitless to speculate, at this point, given that we know so little. we know that we are getting two saga expansions full of nifty cards, with the first box out this friday. sometime soon, the battle of lake-town should be available via POD (yay smaug!). what's after that, we don't know. maybe gencon will give more info (but if i remember last year, we got little-to-no information re: LOTR). maybe the next cycle starts in time for the holidays, maybe it's the beginning of the year. either way, to claim anything definitively, other than what has been stated by FFG, isn't grounded in what we know for sure.

with three releases set to come out in the next few months, i think it's a bit premature to say that the game is dying, coming to an end, or that there is some permanent change to the release schedule (as some have been claiming). i know we are all anxious for what's next, but i think that's keeping us from realizing three sets are coming out in the next couple of months…that's a delay between adventure packs, to be sure, but it's not like we are devoid of new cards.

but if they dont have a big box expansion, and just go straight into the next cycle, where are all the cards going to come from? are we just going to have standalone quests using their own encounter deck (like massing at osgiliath), or are we going to have to re-use the cards from the old box? i don't mind the first one (especially if they make the adventure packs a little bit bigger to accommodate more cards), but i hope it's not the second one

Another expansion, currently scheduled for release later in 2012, will introduce related scenarios that conclude Bilbo’s classic adventure!

These include Bilbo Baggins (The Hobbit: Over Hill and Under Hill, 1), an event with the Baggins sphere of influence, and the new treasure cards. These cards are only intended for use in The Hobbit: Over Hill and Under Hill and a second Saga Expansion, slated to arrive in late 2012, that will relate the second and final half of Bilbo’s adventures.

 

 

This is, what two of the three saga announcements say.. so we will get another Sags Expansion Box of Bilbo later in 2012. gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]

Just because they decided to release two saga expansions doesn't mean they change anything really. I don't really understand what people are so quickly predicting doom and changes for this game when there's no facts to back it up? What not just take the two expansions, rejoy, and then see what Christmas brings? Or Jan 13. Nothing whatsoever hints that FFG is making any changes to other games than CoC, so just sit back and enjoy the ride :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

First of all, I am not predicting doom.  However I just don't see how you can say that an entirely different dispersment system for 6+ months qualifies as not really changing anything.

Why is everyone dismissing the possibility that a new cycle will being in the fall, maybe even between the release of the 2 saga expansions, using cards from the Core Set only (plus each AP), in the same way that Shadows of Mirkwood cycle did?

After all, the model of requiring to always have a Core Set + Deluxe Expansion + AP to be able to enjoy AP won't be sustenable forever (except for us hardcore fans who will buy everything anyway). The major seller of any game line is always the Core Set. Right now, someone wanting to buy the Core set and an AP is limited to the first 6 from the first cycle. Any Dwarrodelf AP requires not only that AP, but the Kazad Deluxe expansion as well.

They need to find a way to make the Core set matter to people buying AP later on.

Also, although most Shadows of Mirkwood AP are still widerly available, there may come a time when they won't be. Rather than just counting on reprints, they should put other products out there that compliment the Core Set.

They could even come up with "optional" type of quests where you get to play it using only encounters from Core + AP or Core + Deluxe + AP, based on what you own.

I do believe this game requires a regular influx of quest cards to keep fresh. I don't think they'll switch to the 4 months release as with CoC. But I don't believe we'll always have this Deluxe + 6 AP type of cycle either. We should hear something soon after the release of the first Hobbit Saga expansion.

Last point of note: why is everyone saying that The Hobbit is released to cash on the movies when it's being released in August and the movie is only coming out in December?

I generally agree with you here. We've had two cycles that are somewhat (if not outright) tangential to the principal source material, so now we get something from the source material. And which item do we start with? The first - ergo we have The Hobbit coming out.

On the other hand, there is the new movie coming out, and even if it's before the movie release, its release is early enough for us, and current enough for fans of the movie to lay hands on one if they're interested. So perhaps the release is timed to around the time of the movie, but as others have pointed out these "saga expansions" will all be released this year while the second (and now third movies) won't come out for another year or two.

Regardless of FFG's motives for releasing The Hobbit, I'm excited that it will be out soon.

Because, in the past, new cycles for every LCG have been announced about five or six months prior to their release.

that's simply not the case (at least not always). AGoT just announced their newest cycle on August 10.

Even if it came out December (it's slated for release in Q4 2012) that's *only* 4 months between its announcement of 8/10. If it's November (which is seeming likely) that's only a 3 month lag. It's entirely possible we could be getting an announcement soon. Or not. we just don't know.

i think the most rational thing to do is A) wait for GenCon B) barring any additional news, enjoy the 3 releases we have coming up (oh, and the "new" art sleeves coming out!). :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Data to follow, you are correct I should have said 4-5 months, rather than 5-6.  However, that doesn't change the fact that it is almost certain we won't see chapter packs in the fall.

For those that care, here are the time frames between announcement of chapter packs and lease dates for AGoT, LotR, and W:I (I would have done CoC, but ran out of time).

then perhaps that's what FFGs announcement on their Facebook page meant by "no announced plans" (or however they worded it)…interesting, if true!

very true…but "there are currently no announced plans for a related cycle as with Khazad-Dum/Dwarrowdelf" (emphasis mine) is also vague/perhaps suggestive. then again, we know how great FFG is with language consistency/clearness of lanuage! haha. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

I think I agree with you on this one.  I think it's presumptuous on any game-makers part to think casual players will want to buy 2 "big boxes" a year (closer to 14 months, I suppose) to support 2 cycles/year structure.  And personally, with the way they have created subsets, I really don't see why they can't mix and match from either the core set itself, or the core+KD to add new AP's to.  Personally, I enjoyed 90% of both of what was in those boxes, so I would love to see them get some "fresh life" by recycling them.  Not to mention, it serves both the customer AND manufacturer to do that every so often: 1) we don't have to shell out larger dollars as often, and 2) they both SAVE money by not spending time and resources to research, develop, and print new big boxes, and MAKE more money off of current stock material (plus keep the more casual fans "hooked"… granted, some of us suckers will buy it regardless.  It says TOLKIEN on  the box… lol).  I really don't see it as being anything but a win for all involved….

Fair question. Simple. I believe we only get this break, not change, because of the movies coming out. Also, you don't really get 12 AP's a year, more around 6-8. (this goes for CoC and W:I too, aGoT might be slightly more polupair due to the new book and the tv series) So, well, getting one pack almost every month for the beginning of the year, to me, Makes it a matter of cause that we won't be getting any more the rest of this year. Instead of beginning a new cycle this year, getting 2 AP's before Christmas, we get the 2 hobbit expansions. If we won't be getting a new AP for January THEN I'll humbly redraw my statement and bang my head against FFG's logo on my monitor :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] Until then, "Do not despair"

 Also, in addition to my post above ^. Every LCG has its own life, not following one standard template for when and what is released. LofR is still too young IMHO to really decide if there's a change or not. For all we know, FFG is going to release, big exp, cycle, big exp, cycle, saga, saga, cycle etc.

Like:

Core

Cycle

Kazaad

Cycle

The hobbit 1

The hobbit 2

(maybe hobbit 3)

Cycle

Big exp

Cycle

Big exp

Cycle

LotR saga 1

2

3

Point being, I think we need to get a little more tho really get into a real idea of how it's going to evolve. (also I forgot the pod that has/will come once a year)

 I wonder if the lack of news has anything to do with Cryptozoic also getting the rights to produce a Lord of the Rings card game. Later this year, they have three 'Deck-Building Game' products coming out. I don't recall if FFG had sole rights for card games in their license agreement or not.

License details are a bit out of my league but I think that Cryptozoic's license comes from the movie license. I think that is why their games have a movie title included in its title. If you look at the Middle Earth Enterprise website, FFG has a license listed right on the webpage, while Cryptozoic does not. I think Cryptozoic, may be more of a sub-lease through the movies.

Or I could be completely wrong… 

I think saw in an early article that the artists for the FFG game need to be as faithful to the descriptions in the book as they can, because that is where their license is from.

yes- they arent allowed to take from movies- i remember an FFG freelance artist saying they are specifically told to stay away from movie-like character illustrations

…..and rightly so
