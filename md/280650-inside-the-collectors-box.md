There is an unboxing here if you want to see what's in the packs, I didn't watch it all

I also watched a few bits and pieces. I have to say that the Card game elements look really good. Beautiful cards, adventures look interesting, and also a help card which I think is a good idea.

Yeah, I was pleasantly surprised with the unboxing and Caleb's thoughts on the card selection. I originally thought this was a complete alt-art version of the original Core. This has started to go into my "Need to buy" column now.

Thanks for posting!  For whatever reason, the lag is really bad on the video for me.  Will any good samaritan take the time to post what appears to be the content of the decks?

Same here.  I was hoping for just a couple repeats of single cards that I had (I only have one core), but this is truly a pleasant surprise.

I'm so excited for this after seeing the decklist. I really hope they send them out soon, I didn't notice an official date for this, unless we are assuming it's coming out right when the PC game releases.

Yup, same date. August 28.

Just got an E-mail five minutes ago saying that my pre-order is shipping soon! Maybe that means we'll have it a little bit early. I've never pre-ordered from FFG so I'm not sure how far in advance this E-mail comes from the ship date.

Ooh, cool! Thanks! Now my attention will be constantly distracted by thoughts of my mailbox.

Yep, shipping soon e-mail here also......hoping to get a tracking note now ?

I just got an "order being processed" email. They told me I'd get a tracking number when it leaves the warehouse.

## 13 [Orcstalker on August 23, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/280650-inside-the-collectors-box/?do=findComment&comment=3449795)

Shipping notice received....order has been shipped. I was beginning to wonder about the rollout date of August 28, but it looks like this will make it here ahead of that by a day or two.

Mine was scheduled for Monday as well but then it got delayed. No estimated date atm... >_>

## 18 [Orcstalker on August 26, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/280650-inside-the-collectors-box/?do=findComment&comment=3451666)

It's here and very nice. Even SWMBO, who doesn't play the game, looked at it and said it was quite nice too!

No, but they are full-bleed.

Just to clarify for @Lukez [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/185805-lukez/]'s sake, I think that's what he meant.

## 23 [Lukez on August 29, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/280650-inside-the-collectors-box/?do=findComment&comment=3454807)

That is what I meant :). thanks to both of you!
