Hey everyone, since a lot of people get into the game because it can be played solo I wanted to share some thoughts about how I've kept solo gaming fresh, hope you enjoy:

great write up! One other thing i do to spice up solo questing is the opposite of one of your points, namely to try and beat easy quests with really godawful decks/heroes: Fatty Bolger soloes passage through mirkwood, stuff like that.

Logging scores is another, either on paper or in the quest log.
