Hey All,

 

I recently started using the FFG Quest Log app, and would like to be able to compare my scores to others. Would any of you chums be willing to add me as a friend?

 

Let me know!

Well the number of losses on my first few quests are a bit embarrassing but I will join peoples friends list... How do you do that again?

Just click on the user name and it should bring up their profile. There should be a button to add the user as a friend. (I just did this to you :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]) Edited March 6, 2014 by Fippin
