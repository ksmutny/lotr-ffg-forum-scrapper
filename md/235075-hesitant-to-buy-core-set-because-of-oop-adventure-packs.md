# [Hesitant to buy core set because of OOP adventure packs](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/235075-hesitant-to-buy-core-set-because-of-oop-adventure-packs/)

So I just discovered this game and want to start playing but after doing research I have discovered that 3 of the Mirkwood Cycle adventure packs are OOP and very expensive to buy. From what I have heard you dont NEED them all or play them in order but the experience is much better if you do. So I am wondering if I should just skip base set and move on to the second base set and the darrowdwelf cycle. ANy opinions? thanks

You have to have the Core Set to play anything else. The adventure packs like dwarrowdelf require their expansion (khazad-dum) and the Core set.

 

I would recommend the Core set and any Mirkwood expansions you want that are available. You'll spend enough time with it, learning rules, deckbuilding and trying the scenarios that by the time you are ready, the remaining Mirkwwod APs should be back. All the LotR stuff in on a constant reprint cycle. You can check status here:

Each big expansion box is followed by six little adventure packs, and eacks adventure pack quests requires it's attached big expension to be played.

Note that you don't need all of the individual adventure packs to play the other adventures once you have the big box -- you can play one, skip another, come back, etc.

 

Also, FFG tends to be good about reprinting, so if you wait they may rerelease the cycle and prices will drop.

exactly this.

they cycle through reprinting old stuff, so if something is OOP now, just wait a few months, and you'll see it come back soon. there will be plenty of other stuff you can buy in the meantime

LotR is in constant reprint, so take your time. At least until people start warning you it's going out of print :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

Buy what you can at regular prices, not from scalpers, and enjoy the player cards if you can't get complete/sequential cycles. Save the encounter cards for when you have the whole cycle and can enjoy it in full. And also remember that the Hobbit saga boxes go very well with Khazad-Dûm/Dwarrowdelf.
