Can you use attachments that are attached to a sacked hero in We Must Away, Ere Break of Day?  It looks to me as if you can.  Sack text reads:

“Attached character cannot ready, attack, defend, commit to quests, or trigger effects.”

The phrase “trigger effects” casts some doubt, but I think that refers only to hero abilities.  Since heroes and their attachments exhaust separate, I presume they would function separately for this as well, so that the Horn of Gondor, for example, can trigger its effect even while attached to a sacked Nori, who cannot trigger his own effect. 

What do you think?
