Drakes have descended into the Anduin Valley from the wild wastes of the Withered Heath. Bent on destruction, they are razing every settlement built by the sons of men in a bid for dominion and the glory of their hoards. As the people of the valley flee their newly claimed home, one among them will not run. While the heroes race to protect the refugees and push back the wyrmseige, Fram Framson calls upon them to aid him in unearthing the legendary sword Wormsbane, with which they can take the fight to the dragons on their home ground...

 

I am building a custom encounter cycle based around the (textually sparse) story of Fram Framson slaying Scatha the Worm in the middle of the Third Age (c. TA 2000). The first of the three scenarios in this story, Fire Under Tree, is fully drafted and I invite anyone interested to test it. You can find the OCTGN materials here [https://www.dropbox.com/sh/gchapsfvhxmjuyx/AADjqljtAjKPZ8HOsgtpIWwEa?dl=0] (dropbox link). If you get a chance to try it out, please let me know your comments, suggestions, complaints, etc.

This is pretty much the kind of scenario I'd like to see if we go northern Rhovanion in this game. One nitpick though, I think Fram had been dead for like a thousand years before the time frame of this game, so that's a little weird.

Also, instead of just copying the names created by Iron Crown Enterprises, I suggest you invent your own names for swords and such, even if they're thematically the same. In the creative artwork cards thread I created a few unique swords, one of which was modeled after Wormsbane (it even had the same flavor text). All of this I say without seeing your cards but from reading your post. Great theme for a scenario, though!

Yet another edit: forget what I said about Fram; I had not seen that the quest takes place long before this game, during Fram's time.

Yes, thematically it is a bit strange to partake in a quest a millenium in the past, but I didn't see any way around it if I wanted to allow for playing through (a loosely interpreted) version of Fram's story.

 

Also, it's a good point about names from I.C.E. I borrowed pretty heavily from The Dragons expansion for MECCG in terms of names (and the artwork in a couple of cases -- still trying to change those out, but it's hard to find appropriate images). I can try to change that all out, or I can acknowledge I.C.E. somewhere.
