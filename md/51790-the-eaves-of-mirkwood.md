The card reads:  "While The Eaves of Mirkwood........encounter card effects cannot be canceled"  Do this include "Shadow card" effects?

Thanks for your help.

 I vote no, my reasoning being because shadow cards are shadow cards, and therefore probably not also encounter cards.

I would have to disagree. There are all when reveal cannot be canceled, shadow effects cannot be canceled and encounter cards cannot be canceled. Therefore, I would believe all text on the encounter card cannot be canceled, when revealed and shadow included.

 It's a bit ambiguous, but the rulebook is pretty careful to never call a shadow card an encounter card.  The only place where the rulebook refers to "encounter cards" is during the Quest phase and during Setup.  Shadow Cards are always referred to as "the top card of the encounter deck."  Some official clarification would be nice, but I'm inclined to say that shadow cards aren't considered encounter cards.  (I'd REALLY like a AGoT-style timing flowchart and definitions list soon.)

I have always played that shadow cards are shadow cards.  They are different from encounter cards, they are just printed on the encounter cards to save us from having a shadow card deck and encounter card deck.  Don't know if that's correct but it's how I understand it.

Yep I'd go with this intepretation - shadow effects are not included.
