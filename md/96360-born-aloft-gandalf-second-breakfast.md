# [Born aloft + Gandalf  + Second Breakfast](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96360-born-aloft-gandalf-second-breakfast/)

## 1 [Legoland on January 5, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96360-born-aloft-gandalf-second-breakfast/?do=findComment&comment=946408)

Hey,

 

at the moment I try to win Carrock with only the cards which were available at this time in Solomodus. Very tricky^^ I use a Tactic/Leadership Deck.

 

But I noticed a synergie which I don´t know befor and of what I think that it´s a little bit to powerfull. I didn´t found anything about it here nor in the FAQ so I want to ask you:

 

Is it possible to to play a Gandalf (Core Set), use his ability, attach "Born aloft" (http://deckbauer.telfador.net/card.html&id=176 [http://deckbauer.telfador.net/card.html&id=176]) to him and than take Gandalf back right befor the end of round? If yes I could use Gandalf 6 times :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] .

Further I could than use "Second Breakfast" (http://deckbauer.telfador.net/card.html&id=174 [http://deckbauer.telfador.net/card.html&id=174]) to take back "Born aloft" to my hand. If thats works in a row too, I could use Gandalf 9 times :o [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_ohmy.png]

 

Don't get me wrong - it´s cool but maybe a little bit overpowered (Cause of 9x 3 card draw,  9x 3 damage tokens or 9x 5 point low threat)

 

I wonder that I found it only now.

 

What do you think about this?

Or is this still illigeal in any way (maybe I have overseen a FAQ information) :ph34r: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_ph34r.png] ?

 

Have a nice week!

I can see no problem there. Only that that is a total of 48 resources, no other problem.

Just have steward of Gondor, horn of Gondor, and one of your heroes be Theodred and you'll have enough resources each turn to do it ha (barring you play no other cards after you have the particulars set up)

It would be cheaper using Gandalf with sneak attack. You can get the benefit (for only 1 phase though) at the cost of 1 resource.

In former times, before Beravor was errataed, one tactic was to draw your whole deck, with multiple copies of Unexpected Courage attached to Beravor, play Sneak Attack three times, play Will of the West, play Sneak Attack three times, etc...

I think it's a solid bet that Will of the West will be errataed in the next FAQ. It's ability to recycle the deck combined with the books/scrolls/tomes from the AtS cycle allow for rapid deck cycling and crazy decks that can achieve turn 2 victories.

 

I'm also betting that Hama gets errataed as well. With the Rohan emphasis in the new Ringmaker cycle, Hama will be a superstar. FFG looks to be cracking down on cards that allow for any kind of a loop or lock effect.

But I can´t use the Effect´s of Gandalf - which were the mainthing of this thought.

Just to expand on what Captain Poe said, Core Set Gandalf's effect triggers every time he is put into play whether you pay for him directly or put him into play using sneak attack. The sneak attack gandalf was considered to be the most powerful effect of the core set days and trying to beat Dol Goldur using the core set pretty much required drawing both Sneak Attack and Gandalf in your starting hand.

 

Due to the power of sneak attack and the ease at which you can recycle event cards, the designers have to be very careful in the future designing any cards that have an "enters play" style effect. These type of effects are very common in MTG but much less so in LotR:LCG. I think this shows that FFG really limited their design space with the sneak attack card. In hindsight it should have been 1 per deck or maybe give it a "victory 1" label, but such a change now would provoke a huge outcry due to the popularity of the sneak attack Gandalf combo.

## 11 [Legoland on January 6, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96360-born-aloft-gandalf-second-breakfast/?do=findComment&comment=947327)

Hm now I´m confused. At the last weekend, my friend who brougt me to that wonderful game allways tells me that Gandalfs effect is not triggerd if I play it with Sneak attack. So we play so since a very long time and don´t miss it. But now I searche many Forums and found that it´s possible.

So - I know this discussion toke place a thousend times, but please:

 

Can I play Sneak attack really with Gandalfs effects?

My friend said also there is a note at the official FAQ about it. But the only limitation is about Stand and fight no neutral cards).

If yes I need to fight all Quest again for much better score and I feel like playing harder as I need until today^^

 

Thanks and good night :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

yeah, any cards that enable recycling need to be handled very carefully, and although I tend to favor a light hand with errata, I wouldn't mind a change to Hama and Will of the West.

 

Sneak Attack definitely can be used with Gandalf as his ability triggers whenever he "enters play" not just when he is "played" or "played from hand" as others have mentioned.

## 13 [Thanatopsis on January 7, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96360-born-aloft-gandalf-second-breakfast/?do=findComment&comment=947367)

Gandalf's text uses the phrase "enters play".

This is probably not documented anywhere, but for me "entering play" means any card being placed face-up on the table.

 

enemy, ally, location, and attachment cards all "enter play"

Treachery and events cards do not "enter play" they are simply "revealed" or "played".  We often set them on the table for reference, but they really have no place being on the board (ex/ I'll place Feint on top of an enemy to remember that is not attacking, but the card really doesn't belong there)

 

Other text that may sound similar to this on other cards includes "put into play" and "play from your hand"

 

"Put into play" applies only to player cards. Any card that we place on the table has been "put into play".

(on the side "reveal" only applies to encounter cards)

"Play from your hand" applies only to cards that start in our hands, are paid for with resources, and then "played" ("put into play" if the card is an ally or attachment).

 

Here is a quick example:

As an event, "Stand and Fight" is '"played" from my hand by paying 1 resource. Erebor Record Keeper is then "put into play" from my discard pile.  Nori and Ori do not trigger since Erebor Record Keeper was not "played from my hand."  Using Sneak Attack to play Erebor Battle Master also does not trigger Nori or Ori. Sneak Attack uses "put into play".

 

Gandalf's card text uses the most high-level wording possible in this game: "enters play".  No matter how you do it, if Gandalf is at any time placed face-up in the play-area, you can trigger his response. [note: is he is under a FoS Nameless thing his card text is blank]

 

I can't help it, here is another example:

If at some point in this game there in ally that states "[ally] get +1ATK when a gondor card is put into play", Gondorian Discipline will not trigger this effect. While this card does have the Gondor trait, it is an event so it therefore never "put into play"

 

...community, please tell me if I am way off on this.

I than you for that detailed answer! Excatly what I´m looking for. I´m totaly in you´re opinion. "Enter play" and "put in play" are not as easy as it seems :ph34r: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_ph34r.png]  So as I can now play Gandalf with seak attack, I know what I gonna have to do this evening^^

Passage Through Mirkwood I´m comming back again. :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

And also thank´s:

I wonder that Beravor has errated, because in the german errate is nothin to find of it. So I take a look in the english again... The german one is not completly translated and also incomplet... So got to read a little bit^^

 

Will there be a day when all our rules will be "revealed" ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]:rolleyes: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_rolleyes.gif]

German translations are often beschissen or nicht vorhanden. Better look for the English texts if you're unsure about a card's text. You can find errata and FAQ in German language here:

 

http://forum.heidelbaer.de/viewtopic.php?f=150&t=12706&sid=9b39f2b59dfdb326cd604434c098cdef [http://forum.heidelbaer.de/viewtopic.php?f=150&t=12706&sid=9b39f2b59dfdb326cd604434c098cdef]

 

However, the German errata don't include Beravor, so I suggest you better use the English version.

We are diverging from the topic, but yes German "translations" are awful...it is such a pity. But I started out with English cards anyway and so I will stick to them. Even though it is not always easy to get my hands on them here in Switzerland

 

Back to the combo: Sneak Attack + Gandalf is really powerful, since you can profit from Gandalfs effects. Born aloft is certainly interesting, since Gandalf sticks around the whole turn, but as has been mentioned it is so resource intensive that I would not call it overpowered in the least.
