Any Canadians frequent this board? I have yet to find any Canadian site that has this game for sale except for amazon.ca however they only have a May release date so who knows if it will actually show up. I could order it from amazon.com I guess since that would be the cheapest I've seen so far.

Also I'll mainly be solo player and perhaps be able to get an occasional 2 player game going so I was wondering what the boards opinion of the solo play? Is it worth getting just for the solo aspect?

Yep.

Still waiting for it in Vancouver. Last rumour I heard was that the truck delivering LotR:TCG to the distributor had not yet crossed the border as of late last week.

German boardgame company stocked it but it's no all sold out, maybe email them to see how long you'd have to wait.Â  They have some of the best prices in Canada, although there's always the shipping cost.
