 I just came across a new situation where I had 2 Goblin Snipers in the staging area.  His text reads:

 During the encounter phase, players cannot optionally engage Goblin Sniper if there are other enemies in the staging area.

So, does that mean that while they are both in the staging area there's no way to get rid of them?  And you're forced to take the 2 damage points to heroes every turn?  I know there's a few cards out there that let you damage/encounter them, but under normal circumstances am I right in thinking you're stuck with them?

yes guess youre stuck with them till you reach 48 threat or you kill one of them by other means

not building a deck that can deal with them is the mistake here. Yes they are both stuck there until 48 threat. Use Dunhere to attack them or Gandalf, Descendant, Beekeeper/Orc Slayer+Thalin, in fighting... etc etc ... many many ways to deal with these guys so build your deck accordingly.

Yes.

There are a good lot of cards that can still solve your problem, though. hehe

 Yeah, that's a bad situation, but you should generally at least have Gandalf in your deck.

Also, you can use Daughter of Nimrodel or Self Preservation to cancel out that damage very turn.

(Heck, Gloin + Self Preservation + two snipers is a nice way to get an extra two resources every round lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif])

These kind of ideas are great, turning a encounter card into a boon for you is such a good way to build a deck. I remember back in the 1st APs, i forget witch now... but there was a discard attachment treachery and Tragic made a great deck that used this effect as a major strategy to move steward of gondor around his heroes. Allowing a early (no steward) mid (steward) and late game (steward on new hero). It was pretty cool.

This Golin thing is a great resource engine that is basically for free, one of the best solutions to snipers I have read.
