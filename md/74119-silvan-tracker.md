 Once they start giving us some more Silvan allies….

Really, now that Elrond is out, it is only a matter of time before this card gets errata'd.  Can you imagine a full Silvan deck, 3 trackers on the table and Elrond in play?  Heal 6 damage on each Silvan character per turn!  On any side of the table!!!

Since it is a response, you can choose to trigger it every time an opportunity arises (a Silvan readies).

You're welcome.

 

Just adding to the OP, I don't think this card is really overpowered as the OP is painting it to be.
To be honest, I find it sub-par even considering Elrond. Even with more Silvan, he won't be in the errata radar so soon.

perhaps silvan characters will be naturally weak? therefore they wont have a chance to be healed as a big enough attack will kill them

This is certainly currently the case. Even with a Burning Brand on them, Silvan Trackers can't take much punishment. Whether this continues in future is another matter - was it the case with Tolkein that Elves have the standard fantasy 'skilful but wimpish' trait, vs a dwarf's 'tough but slow'? Can't think this would have been the case, but maybe they'll be designed this way?

this is an interesting question and as you say they certainly werent the cliche 'warhammer' woodelves, but we do see them using stealth in favour of fighting, for instance in the hobbit with the dwarves in mirkwood.

they did however take part in the battle of 5 armies, storm dol guldur and repel several attacks in the war of the ring…..so i dont think they were 'weak' per se but i do have a feeling this is how they shall be portrayed

i just hope they dont go down the film route of making woodelves into some ninja warrior race like legolas

That's what I thought. Always remembered the Elves were particularly impressive throughout Tolkein's works, much unlike Warhammer Elves. And ninja warriors would be dreadful. To be honest, FFG did a pretty good job with the dwarves not to make them horribly cliched, and some of them really nicely reflected the lore of the dwarves. I expect them to do a good job with the Silvan keyword, in time. The Mirkwood Runner is still, in my opinion, one of the best designed allies in the game. Elegantly designed, I've always felt.

One time I hate the film adaptation was during the Battle of Helm's Deep. Not as much for the presence of the Elven forces but much more for their weakness. In Silmarillion you learn how superior the Noldor were to orcs in battle. Of course not every elf was a warrior but one would think if Elrond or Galadriel sent an elite unite to fight, they'd rank among the best. And as such they should take care of even the Uruks easily, and certainly fight at least as wel as the likes of Aragorn.

While Sam was storming the tower in search of Frodo in Mordor, the orcs seemed to think it was an elf-lord and shuddered at the thought of it.  Would this not apply to all elves, Silvan and Noldor alike?   I was under the impression that elves were superior warriors on Middle Earth.  Am I wrong?

no this is correct…..especially during the first and second ages elves were the finest warriors in middle earth. in the third age they were sort of 'loosing interest' compared to the previous ages, but still the best :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
