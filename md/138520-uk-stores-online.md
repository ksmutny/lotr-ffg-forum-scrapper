Any recommendations for the best?

Being in uk its not easy to order from ffg store.

 

Amazon uk seems ok for core but expensive for expansions.

Chaos cards looks good prices but some out of stock

Ebay is usual minefield

 

Any suggestions please?

Thanks

I got mine mostly from Bookdepository. Right now, LOTR products are mostly out of stock. You should check it out though. Just search for 'lord of the rings lcg' and 'lord of the rings the card game'.

I like www.gameslore.co.uk [http://www.gameslore.co.uk] - fast and reliable.

 

However it has taken them a very long time to get some POD sets in stock.

I've tried both Boardgameextras and boardgameguru.

chaoscards usually has some of the more recent sets too, +boxes and a whole bunch of accessories.
