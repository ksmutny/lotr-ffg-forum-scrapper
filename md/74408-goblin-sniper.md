 Sorry if this has already been asked before, but if there are 2 copies of Goblin Sniper in the staging area, does that mean I can't engage either of them? Or since they are the same card, can I still engage them as long as they are the only enemies in the staging area?

 Oh… Alright. Thanks for the clarifications. 

And by the way, I've been reading your Tolkienology series, and they are amazing.  I'm only on chapter 4, but so far my favorite is the Tom Bombadil chapter. He always amazed me.

 Yeah they are great! 

Another question:

If I'm defending with someone like Winged Guardian, and the shadow effect I get is Pursued by Shadow, and he is my only exhausted ally, then is the attack considered undefended when I take him back into my hand?

yeah-if the defender is removed half way through its considered undefended, which can be deadly

 Yes. It killed poor Thalin. But, my handy Landroval saved his life. gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]

Another question about the goblin sniper... The sniper cannot be optionally engaged if there is another enemy in the staging area.

 

If there is one other enemy in the staging area can one player engage the other enemy then the second player engage the goblin sniper now that there is no other enemy in the staging area? Or can the second player not engage the goblin because there is another enemy in the area at the start of the engagement phase?

Since engagement is done one player at a time, that would work fine.  As long as there are no enemies in the staging area when it is your turn to make an optional engagement, you can engage the sniper.
