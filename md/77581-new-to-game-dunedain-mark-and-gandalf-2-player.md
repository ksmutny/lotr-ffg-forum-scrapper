# [New to Game: Dunedain Mark and Gandalf 2 Player](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/77581-new-to-game-dunedain-mark-and-gandalf-2-player/)

On the Dunedain Mark card it states:  "Action:  Pay one resource from attached hero's pool to attach Dunedain Mark to another hero."  Does this mean that I can pay a resource and "invisibly" attach Dunedain Mark to another hero?  Or does this mean I physically take the card off of one hero to attach it to another?  

My other question is in reference to Gandalf in a 2 player game.  Can a player pay resources for Gandalf if Gandalf is in the other player's hand?  In other words, if a "neutral" resource player card is in a player's hand, can the other player pay his own resources for it to bring it into play?  Thanks for any help you can afford me in clearing this up.

1- You have to physically attach it to the other hero.

 

2 - No. Only the player that have the card in it's hand, can pay to put it in play…

As CJMatos stated, you can only pay for cards that are from your hand; however, it is possible to pay for cards, (from your hand), and give them to other people. So you can pay for your Gandalf and give him to your second player.

Wrong…

To other players you can only give attachments or events… Allies not.

Really? Apologies, I retract my statement.

Just re-read the manual and found it in the back, I was wrong, Alies cannot come into play under another player's control. Apologies for any confusion.
