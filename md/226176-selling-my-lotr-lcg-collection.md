I'd like to sell my collection of Lord of the Rings cards.  I have the original Core set plus every deluxe expansion (and all six of each of the cycles that go with it except for the most recent Grey Havens cycle) as well as all the Saga expansions up to date.  The only thing I don't have is the Nightmare sets or the stand-alone sets from Gen Con.  All the cards were sleeved when used and so are in near-mint to mint condition.This would be a great way to get just about everything you need in one  huge lot!

 

If interested, contact me at rborkowitz@gmail.com with an offer and any questions you might have.  Thanks!
