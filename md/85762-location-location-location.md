What is the ruling on duplicate locations? If I am in the process of completing an active location and draw a second copy to the staging area during the quest phase and then later in the round complete the exploration of the active location, do I discard both? The latest FAQ states: "A location card is immediately discarded from play any time it has as many progress tokens as it has quest points, whether it is active or not."

 

Or, if you don't discard both, do you explore the same location again when you make the second copy the active location?

no- they function as completely different cards...just the same title and traits etc.

so you complete the first copy of gladden fields for instance, and then you have to travel to the other copy to get rid of it (or use card effects)

That's what I thought but the FAQ confused me. Must be some card effect that I have not run across that is used to add travel tokens to a location while still in the staging area.

yes, there are cards that add progress to locations in staging area.

a couple of these are northern tracker and asfaloth

in these cases they are discarded any time they have enough progress

Thank you so much for the clarification. Traveling to a location more than once seems to be in keeping with the storyline, not unlike Frodo and Sam wandering Emyn Muil until Gollum came along.

indeed! if you dont already have the emyn muil pack, this is exactly the theme that the quest goes for .
