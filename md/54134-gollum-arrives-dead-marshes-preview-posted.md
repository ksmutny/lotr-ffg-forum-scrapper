We've finally caught up with Gollum! And "Quick Hitch" is an "Unexpected Courage" for Hobbit characters - the article mentions Bilbo a lot but I am thinking Wandering Took myself...

Well, now I want to create a hobbit themed deck...

And Bilbo not having much attack "for now" could be a hint that Sting is coming soon.

 I'm also wishing to see a few more hobbits spring up.

Nice.

But yes, bring on the hobbits! Am hoping for some sneaky, stealthy ways of playing to go along with them!

I hope they have some events to help hobbits "sneak" in for an attack. Something that ignores enemy defense, or at least subtracts from it. This already exists in the encounter deck as a shadow effect and it would be nice for us to have the same opportunity as players.

Yes the previous Lotr Tcg Decipher have this idea. There was some events cards cancel skirmish with hobbit.

God I hate hobbits, have ever since Middle-Earth CCG. Even putting up with Wandering Took is a pain, Bilbo and Frodo won't ever see action for me.

MECCG had great Hobbit cards, Halfling stealth, Halfling strength. Surely this game will bring out similar cards (eventually).

Must admit I'm not a big fan of Hobbits either, but the occasional 'duck and cover' deck made for a nice change in MECCG.

Hey Dam Common man!!!! How you can hate hobbits????  But actually i also not really big fan of those Hobbits deck in Decipher Lotr TCG. But in this game something switch inside me. I think i want to try build some hobbits deck.

 meccg had some of the coolest things you could do with hobbits! building a deck and destroying the one ring instead of winning the game by marshalling points is just awesome with hobbits...

and in lotr tcg, you could build some decent decks with hobbits...

all in all, if you don't like them, don't play them, but I think they have a very interersting approach to the standard - hack and slay, buffed heroes of middle earth... I LIKE!

Yeah, and playing against them was so fun llorando.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/llorando.gif] ! Hazard limit of 2, all your creatures are basically useless and if you ever got play a creature, it got cancelled. Only good hobbit is a dead hobbit in my book.

One of the reasons Middle-Earth Quest rates so highly for me is that there are no hobbits in it. Okay, there is one "Mad Baggins" encounter card, but I can live with that.
