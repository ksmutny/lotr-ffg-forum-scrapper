(CS83)

During the encounter phase, players cannot optionally engage Goblin Sniper if there are other enemies in the staging area.
Forced: If Goblin Sniper is in the staging area at the end of the combat phase, each player deals 1 point of damage to 1 character he controls.

 

"other enemies" mean other than this one card or other than each card named Goblin Sniper.

If there are 2 Goblin Snipers and first option is true than it won't be possible to engage any of them untill end of game.

True, very nasty encounter combo. If you have this problem, only you can fix it with Gandalf Core, Dunhere, Son of Arnor..., and similiars that damage from staging or move enemies out of staging.

If there are any other enemies at all in the staging area you cannot engage the goblin sniper and of course as mentioned above if there become two goblin snipers you can never optionally engage them for that game. Your threat would have to get to 48 and then they engage you or you engage them or do direct damage with certain cards.

I've found a way to engage one of two gobiln snipers with Core card.

 

Son of Arnor (CS15)

 

Response: After Son of Arnor enters play, choose an enemy card in the staging area or currently engaged with another player. Engage that enemy.

All ... not so sure

He just forgot a double Longbeard Orcslayer would do the job as well ... just with the Core set ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

One thing you may want to try is Gloin. If you can get a healer out or that heal attachment that heals 2.. you have just found a awesome resource engine.
