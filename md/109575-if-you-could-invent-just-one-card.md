...what would it be?

I've always thought that it would be pretty cool if you could turn an ally on the table into a fully-fledged hero. Maybe you could have an event called "leading by example" or something like that, which would let him step up and replace another hero when they die, so you'd still only have a maximum of three.

I think it would be cool to have a card that lets you build a fortification or something along those lines. I imagine this would fit well with Gondor.

an event card - the artwork would be the front door and garden of bag end... it would be titled something like "what to do with the time that is given to us"  ..basically it would be a 'hope' card, in the most critical part of the game that would give a huge boost but at the large cost... for those times where you want to win at all costs

 

perhaps...

 

Cost 0

discard all allies and attatchments from play, then give 1 hero X willpower, where X is the cost of all cards disarded

Honey Cakes

 

0 Cost

Lore Attachment

Item. Food.

Attach to a character.

Action: Discard Honey Cakes to give attached character +1 Willpower, +1 Attack and +1 Defense until the end of the phase. You may discard a Condition attachment from that character.

I'd like to see artifacts and things in the encounter decks. We have them in Saga boxes but they are very powerful. 

 

The thing is the classic RPG style thing with questing and all that is often about collecting loot and stuff. So I would like to see this done somehow in the game. Searching dead bodies for loot as a exhaust action or something to get a axe or sword that is unique to that enemy or w/e. Maybe make the fated or somthing to limit them.. so the new axe can only last so long.

If you want to emulate looting an enemy without actually adding loot cards, you could have an ally with the ability: "Response: after you defeat an enemy, exhaust this ally to draw a card." Definitely not what you were hoping for but it's still pretty nice.

## 10 [Cunir on June 28, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/109575-if-you-could-invent-just-one-card/?do=findComment&comment=1136385)

that looting idea is quite cool. maybe it could just be something easy like turning over the top card of your player deck after you kill someone. if it's an attachment then keep it, otherwise you discard it.

 

that is probably way too easy though, so how about turning over the "nth" card, where "n" is the engagement cost of the enemy. that would stop people scrying their deck and making it too easy.

You could do that with an attachment that says something like:

 

Action: Discard X facedown cards from attached hero to give +X attack until the end of the phase.

Response: When attached hero destroys an enemy, you may attach that enemy card facedown to attached hero.

 

Similar to Eagles of the Misty Mountains, but a one-off effect. You could use it to stockpile nasty enemies so they don't reappear in the encounter deck.

Guard Dogs

2 cost Ally

0 Willpower

0 Attack

0 Defense

2 Hitpoints

 

Forced: After an enemy engages you, attach guard dogs to that enemy.

After Guard Dogs attaches to an enemy, it gains: Forced: Deal attached enemy 1 damage. Attached enemy can not attack for the rest of the round.  At the end of the round, discard Guard Dogs from play

 

Basically its supposed to represent your Heroes letting some guard dogs loose, which jump and snap at an enemy which makes him so focused on dealing with these vicious dogs that he can't attack you.  However, you can kill him while he's distracted with the dogs if you have enough ready soldiers left.  And of course, the dogs have to hurt the enemy a little bit so I added the 1 damage.  At the end of the round, the enemy finally fights off the dogs.....if he is still alive.......

 

Not sure which sphere though.

I don't have a lot of card ideas in particular, but I would like to see some further Gondor development. I remember talk on these forums during the AtS cycle that Outlands came out of nowhere and suddenly had more options and synergy than Gondor did. Raven1015 already mentioned a fortification - I would also like an ally like "Trebuchet Guard" - maybe a semi-expensive ally that you could discard to deal damage to each enemy in the staging area (alternatively exhaust and use a hero's resource token of any or one particular sphere for "ammunition"). Gondor really held out long against Mordor; I think siege equipment and defensive mechanisms would be fun to see.

i would quite like to see more food and meals. stuff that you can eat on your trails, at the end of the round, to cure wounds. maybe mix them with a campfire card as well, to get more benefit out of them.

Good Meal, Second Breakfast, Miruvor, Cram... only Lembas is missing for our amazing food deck! 

 

Personally I'd like to see more magic artifacts, either the way boored suggests as encounter "loot", or as player cards. I'd especially like to see more rings, as my dream is to build a ring deck. We could have some of the missing Seven, and of course Lesser Rings like the ones from MECCG (ring of courage, ring of words, ring of nature, etc). One would think that in a cycle called The Ring Maker we would get this, but it seems we're not getting such cards other than Nenya.

Loot cards would be an interesting idea.  Here's a take on it:

 

They are neutral player cards with 0 cost added to your deck like every other card.  Each has a response condition which must be met to be played.  For example,

 

 

Glamdring - (neutral) (0)

 

loot.  weapon.

 

Response: after a character you control participates in an attack that destroys a troll enemy, attach Glamdring to one of your heroes from your hand.  Limit 1 loot card per phase.

 

Attached hero gains +1 (will) and +1 (attack).  If attached hero is Gandalf (hint hint), he gains a (tactics) resource icon.

 

 

Or...

 

Phial of Galadriel (neutral) (0)

 

loot.  artifact.

 

Response:  After questing successfully, exhaust Galadriel to attach Phial of Galadriel to an ally committed to that quest.  Limit 1 loot card per phase

 

Action:  Discard Phial of Galadriel to deal 2 damage to each enemy for each shadow card on it.  Then, discard all shadow cards without resolving them.

 

This would be a way to incorporate this kind of concept without introducing new mechanics or changing rules.

All right, one more idea: I wish Noldor/Silvan had more sturdy allies. I realise card stats are meant to be thematic and reflect elements like the strong walls of Gondor (Defender of Rammas) or resolve of the Rohirrim (Escort from Edoras, among others), but most elven allies are too squishy to survive an attack strength of 3 - and few enemies in the later packs are weaker than that. Celeborn will help with this when he is released, but I'd still like to see more allies like Mirkwood Tracker who can take a hit without leaving play. Gildor and Haldir are great but unique, and expensive.

I'd love a Gondor hero with 2 Wp and a low threat (7-8). Caldara doesn't really work, since here ability is designed for mono sphere. With a resource sharing or card draw ability, this might be enough to make gondor viable.

Yup, that and one or two Leadership Gondor allies with strength more than 2 will make Gondor viable as a solo deck IMO.

Pretty much every good Gondor card in the Against the Shadow cycle went instead to mono-sphere, and that's why I think it never got the boost it needed. Knight of Minas Tirith? I'd totally have that in my Leadership-Tactics deck with Beregond or whatever. Nope, it's a monosphere card. White Tower Watchman? Mono-sphere. And many more. Not to mention no hero in the cycle with Gondor synergy beyond having the trait. And again not to mention the insanity of Outlands. Anyway, I think Gondor had been given little support, apart from a couple powerful cards like Visionary Leadership, but it feels so incomplete right now  You could say that they expanded on the Ithilien rangers which is true, but I'm talking about the Leadership "generic" Gondor trait. With so many crappy allies like the Pelargir guys and squires and custodians, I don't feel satisfied.

## 32 [MyNeighbourTrololo on July 8, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/109575-if-you-could-invent-just-one-card/?do=findComment&comment=1147806)

You don't need mono tactics to have Knight of Minas Tirith. It's a powerful 3 attack ally, 4 attack with Boromir. Tower Watchman has a pretty good stat block for his cost, and he's neutral, meaning you can pay for him as long as you have enough of whatever resources. He's a decent defender, and can become even better with Gondorian Discipline. Pelargir Captain, Pelargir chick and original Gondorian Watchman from core set become beasts with Boromir and Visionary Leadership, each with 2 willpower and 2 attack. Custodian is good just because his printed cost is big while his actual cost can be zero, meaning you can play couple of those and then safely deploy two costy allies literally with no effort. 

## 33 [Gizlivadi on July 8, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/109575-if-you-could-invent-just-one-card/?do=findComment&comment=1147812)

I've never been able to play the Custodian for zero or even 1, but then again I haven't tried it many times. While they can become good I agree, especially the Envoy of Pelargir for her cost, thei're still pretty boring allies. I would expect from Leadership Gondor some cool knights, archers, lancers, not ship captains. And the reason they're not that good, but merely decent, is that compared to how they could be done now they are pretty basic. Recent allies have been much more powerful than the 1wp 1attack core set ally.

The main problem with solo thematic Gondor is that none of the Gondor heroes have higher than 2 willpower, with more than half having only 1 or even 0. The starting willpower of your heroes is such a key part of solo play that you can get away with this low potential against some quests, but the more difficult or quicker paced ones will punish you.

You don't need to have a full set of Gondor heroes, take just the ones who provide needed synergy, and fill remaining slots with what you need.

> You don't need to have a full set of Gondor heroes, take just the ones who provide needed synergy, and fill remaining slots with what you need. 

 

Of course, but I believe that Gizlivadi is talking about a "thematic" Gondor deck, where each hero would have the Gondor trait.

Purely thematic decks suck by nature, mostly. If you want purely thematic deck to work - play easy mode.

 

And I still can't see what non-thematic will be in a deck, dedicated to Gondor but with less than 3 Gondor heroes. Peoples of Middle Earth helped each other.

You can take Aragorn, Boromir and Beregond. It's really high starting threat, but you fight easily and with sword that was broken and visionary leadership I managed to quest for 50 (in multiplayer, another player lowered my threat)

I see your point, but I'd still love to be able to make Gondor heavy work without using Hobbits that should only show up there several years later, or a certain overused Elf. The issue is really the lack of heroes with good willpower to threat ratio to survive those crucial first couple turns in solo play.

Also, do thematic decks really suck? Dwarves and Outlands can be thematic and strong, Rohan is pretty decent, Elves have some builds and will only get better with the Silvan cards. Even Hobbits can work to a degree. But I guess Gondor will get another boost late in the Sagas.

Cost: 1

Response: Choose a hero just killed. Ready hero. At the end of the round, discard hero. If the hero has the printed tactics resorce icon, discard hero at the of next round instead.

Good idea.

 

It could run well with Sneak-attack + Landroval in refresh phase. ^^

 

 

But maybe too overpowered with Boromir tactics and Caldara. If they die, you can use this card and after use their abilities.

Well, up until now I always wanted some sort of armour attachment that gives Sentinel plus a boost to either defense or hitpoints and I wanted it to be usable on Elrohir and Elrond.

I'd love a card like this:

Sword throw. 0 cost tactics event. Discard an attached weapon to deal two damage to an enemy engaged with another player.

An action inspired by the movies maybe, but I think it fits well for the card game as a last resort to save another player.

Fun ideas here and so many I can think of..

Trebuche: Tactics attachment 3 cost. Place 2 resources on Trebuche. Forced: Remove 1 resource at the start of each encounter phase. Forced: when all resources are removed deal 3 damage among enemies in the staging area. Place 2 resources on Trebuche.

Skilled with the Bow: Lore event 2 cost. All Noldor and Silvan characters gain Ranged until the end of the phase.

Courageous Sacrifice: Spirit event 2 cost. Response: After a hero is destroyed, discard an ally you control to put that hero back into play with 2 damage.

Reposition: Leadership event 2 cost. Each player may choose an ally they control and put it under the control of another player.

Trebuche and Courageous Sacrifice are over-powered to me...

Skilled with the Bow is really nice! I love it, good idea. :wub: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wub.png]

Reposition, mmmmh , yes ok ^_^ [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_happy.png]

Yeah perhaps, they would definitely need to get play tested. but the Trebuche only goes off every other round, does cost a decent amount and may go off at not the best time depending on what enemies are in the staging area that phase. This card sound so fun though!! I really hope we get something like this! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

As for Courageous Sacrifice, I really think Spirit needs something like this showing their loyalty and courage as described in the rule book. This card could be OP especially since you could comfortably take an undefended and then just discard a cheap ally... so it probably does need some more limitations.

 

I really like the idea of commanding your army of allies, so giving them all ranged or maybe some temporary defense bonus for a phase would all make for awesome cards.

Not really one card, but I would really like quests that are centered around corruption (like the 'betrayal' of Boromir). I could envision a mechanic involving corruption counters, and when a character has, say, two or three times its willpower in corruption counters, it would engage the first player. You could get corruption counters by getting attacked by a nazgul or something.

I always have thought it is the threat side of the game.

I would like TPTB to do a armour keyed to Rohan, Riding Armour or some such. I'm hoping it might be incoming after the Elven Mail showed up in The Three Trials.

I really hope the Noble attachment we'll get in the Ring Maker will combo with Eleanor.
