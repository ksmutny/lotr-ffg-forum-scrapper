This page: http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=3792 [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=3792]

says this: "The Nightmare Decks from the season one The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game Game Night Kits will be available to players via Print on Demand after the Kits are rotated out of circulation later in 2013."

Questions:

1) Approximately when will the first season of Game Night Kits be "rotated out of circulation?  The pre-order deadline for season 2 is 31 May, but "Kits will begin shipping in July". Does this mean season 1 Nightmare Decks will be available to us in July?

2) Will we need to order the Nightmare Decks directly from FFG, or will they be sold on Amazon/Funagain/etc. as well?

3) Are Nightmare Decks appropriate for solo play, or are they mostly for groups of [skilled] players?

4) What Nightmare Decks will be included in season 2?

5) Will the Nightmare Deck cards be added to OCTGN (or have they already)?

Thanks!

Here are my thoughts on some of your points.

2) Usually, the print on demand expansions are initially only available through FFG, but I’ve seen numerous stores now stocking The Massing at Osgiliath and The Battle of Lake-Town. So, if you’re willing to wait a bit, you’ll probably be able to order the Nightmare packs from your FLGS.

4) If you go back to the Season 2 announcements, you’ll see they listed the actual adventures getting the Nightmare treatment. I believe it’s the first 3 packs from the Shadows of Mirkwood cycle.

5) I don’t think they’ve been added yet. I don’t see why they wouldn’t be added; I’m sure they would be if spoilers were widely available. I’ll certainly push to get them once the Print on demand version becomes available.
