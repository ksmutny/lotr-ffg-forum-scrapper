After the heroes it's time for the enemies to have their turn under the spotlight, in my opinion.

Here comes the Dungeon Jailor in all his orcish nastiness (as usual, click the image if you wish for a closer aquaintance).

Agreed, one of the best ! It's a good thing the card looks great, because she's so nice as a card draw engine, she'll get played a lot I think.

To be honest I didn't yet pay much attention to the artists of the cards. But Beravor certainly caught my eyes on the hero side...and I really like the jailor card, too! And I really hate the guts of that guy, too! Same goes for Caught in a web...nice artwork and bad-ass card lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif]

It seems that we have more ore less the same images in our mind when reading Tolkiens descriptions. Great job on the cards!

Thank you so much! Honestly The Lord of the Rings is an hard IP to work into, given how popular it is and how strongly the fans feel about the characters and the setting, so the fact that my vision of them doesn't disappoint and 'clicks' for you means quite a lot. happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]

Beravor is easily the card I've done up to now that I've enjoyed most, but then, I do enjoy painting beautiful girls (hope the ladies on the forums don't take me wrong, it's just that I find the female form beautiful per se)
