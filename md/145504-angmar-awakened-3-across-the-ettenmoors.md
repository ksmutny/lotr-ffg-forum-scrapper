So, we're getting objective locations? Unless they're not telling us something special about this quest, that seems rather unnecesary. Don't we already have a location card type they could use for this, as they've been using them in past quests like Rhosgobel or Morgul Vale? If these new objective locations work the same way as regular ones, I don't see the point in making them objectives. It's like they made an objective enemy boss that we put aside at the beggining and then put it into play so we can kill it at the end. There's no point in making them objectives, and only makes the game more inconsistent. I wish these had been regular locations, but we'll have to see.

 

I like the spoiled player cards, but seriously, no character spoilers again? That's a bit dissapointing. I would have been happy with a partial ally card in the fan or something. Only getting events again isn't really exciting (I'm not mentioning the side quest since it was already partially spoiled and most people already had guessed correctly what it does), even though the events themselves look pretty good. Tutors are great, and the leadership event will work great with Gather Information in a combo deck.

 

Also, I had been thinking of new troll quests, but this seems like a Carrock rehash in terms of theme. While the enemies themselves look exciting (and the art on both of them is great!), I would like to see in the future a unique troll boss that isn't a "wild" troll, so to speak. A big armored Olog-hai as a general of Mordor's army would be an interesting enemy, instead of yet another hill or wilderness troll.

The quest looks cool.  I'm ok with the objective locations or at the very least i'm not surprised by it.  This game has been out long enough that the designers need to be pretty creative when making quests so that they seem like a new fresh experience so some extra convolution here and there is kind of necessary.  Plus we dont know exactly how they'll function so there may still be some part of the way they work which would separate them from a normal location.

 

Not much in the way of player card spoilers.  We already knew of the side quest and had seen the image of the neutral event...now we just know what it does.  The dunedain message can be helpful, but we'll need to see the remainder of the sphere'd side quests before its full potential can be realized.  Hard to get too pumped up for a card search event besides.

 

I feel bad for whoever has to write these up and choose which cards are spoiled be it Caleb, Matt or someone else.  Give us too many player card spoilers and we lament about how terrible it will be to have to wait 6 months to use any of the stuff, dont give us enough and theres frustration that theres not enough to look forward to or discuss

It's definitely significant that the spoiled encounter side quest does not have surge.  As far as I know, all of the encounter side quests from Lost Realm have it.  I don't receive my copy until Wednesday, so could someone who has Lost Realm confirm this?

 

Also, is it just me, or did the designers purposefully conceal the sphere of None Return?  So frustrating!

I'm thinking that the "objective locations" will work differently than the location card type, having some kind of unique mechanic that can't (or shouldn't) be represented with a bunch of 0-threat locations.  Anyway, I think that you are jumping to conclusions based solely on the card type, name, and picture. 

 

Lake-town was another "objective location" in the past which easily could have been represented by an actual location card, but I've never heard anyone mention that before.

I expected this as well, but there's actually a few encounter side quests that don't have surge. These tend to be the ones that have a significant effect right off the bat (like a mini-treachery).

From what I see this quest sounds epic going from intense moments fighting trolls to recouping at safe locations, pretty cool. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] The low defense on those trolls means they could easily be taken out with a combo of Straight Shot and one of many other cards from Tactics.

 

Dunedain Message seems a bit crazy. I expected a card that would search for these side quests otherwise they are nothing more than an occasional cool thing to pop up. I thought there would maybe be a "search the top 10 cards of your deck" rather than whole deck because now we can always pull out those side quests! This also made me think of Message From Elrond which is best with events especially ones that fetch something from your deck.

Regarding objective locations, thus far the Guarded keyword has only ever appeared on objectives, so maybe they wanted to keep that consistent (Since the article did mention they're all Guarded).

Maybe, but they could've just put a travel or when revealed ability that worked to the same effect. As someone else said, I am aware that it is too early to judge, since there may be a reason these are not regular locations. I just can't think of any, so I wanted to put my thoughts out early. Personally, I am a fan of consistency, so I don't like to see cards made objectives when they easily could have been the card type they should be. If these are just regular locations that are set aside or even shuffled into the deck, why not make The Carrock an objective location? Why not make Ghulat an objective enemy?

A big armored Olog-hai as a general of Mordor's army would be an interesting enemy, instead of yet another hill or wilderness troll.

Couldn't agree more re the location not needing to be an objective, they really don't need to make the game more inconsistent or complex when it is totally unnecessary. I too would love to see an Olog-hai general or boss and am a little sick of Wild Trolls as well. Why have we not seen a single siege style quest with any trolls? I'm sure Sauron utilized them in such battles and would have had at least a handful in each of his mighty hosts. The Siege of Cair Andros or The Massing at Osgiliath both could have easily included trolls that are not wild. 

 

I am actually not a fan of the art for Cruel Mountain Troll. The horns seem wrong and that grey hair looks too much like tattered rags to me.... plus it seems a little too big.... not sure how exactly our heroes take on something that size and easily slay it. Looks far bigger than any other troll and more similarly sized to the Stone Giants from the Hobbit or even the Balrog yet has stats very similar to any other troll. His mechanics are great though, removing progress for any overflow damage done if the defending character bites the dust. I like that this has remained as a standard troll ability with slight variations;

we now have a troll that turns any excess damage into threat, a troll that places excess damage on a second character and one that turns excess damage into a loss of progress tokens. 

 

The ruthless hill troll however looks amazing and I really like that art. More brutal, less typical billy goats gruff troll looking and more like a massive hulking Uruk. I also really like the mechanic of it being stronger when damaged.

 

Player cards sound pretty varied in this one and it sounds like we will get an actual ent character and not just ent focused cards that might be attachments or events. The new hero is tactics which always excites me and sounds like it is going to be a new defensive hero! I really can't make up my mind on what I think of the tactics sidequest...... for combat heavy scenarios it might be just what you need to take out some especially nasty foes that are stopping your progression. It has 8 quest points however so may take more than just one turn to clear if you fall short on questing power. One thing to note is that because you get to discard an enemy engaged with each player you can use more offensive characters to quest with rather than saving them for combat which makes clearing the player quest far easier. As well as this it can be ANY non unique enemy (that is not immune) so you can discard some real heavy hitters (like the trolls in this new quest!) with it.

I, for one, am not too excited for all of the upcoming Ent support.  I don't like the idea of player cards with strong affinity or the same theme spilling over between cycles (Ents, Signals, etc.) because some players don't have enough funds to buy everything and they stick to specific cycles.  These players won't be able to get the most effective use out of their cards.  Just my two cents.

 

However, I love Mounts and am super excited for Shadowfax and this new mystery one!

I'd still want to use Forest Snare on him because that 4-6 attack can be terrible. You'll also need to always move ALL the damage off of him to make sure his defense doesn't stay high.

Dunedain message looks like really good card when playing duo/tri colour decks with many of those good suff side quests in your deck.

Specially in multi player, where everybody gets the benefits.

 

But what's with that none return lore card art? 

Two shot dead characters and such a title?

Really makes me wonder what it does....

 

And finally: trap deck for this quest anyone?

These trolls are not immune!

I smell ranger spikes I do.

I was thinking the same about None Return. Looks more like a treachery I'd say. But probably the dead characters are orcs, and maybe it refers to the lore Rangers or Silvan elves.

Except that the battle questing only lasts while the side quest remains in play, which means it doesn't help you actually progress through the quest.

While the point is up, what do you guys would think if the game had two attachments, both cost 1, sphered by tactics, attach to the current quest, and turn it into the battle or siege?

## 28 [joezim007 on April 10, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/145504-angmar-awakened-3-across-the-ettenmoors/?do=findComment&comment=1553822)

That is certainly an interesting proposition. In one sense, being able to control whether a quest is battle or siege or not is extremely powerful and can have a huge affect on the outcome of the game, but on the other hand adding B/S to a quest tends to just make the quest more difficult for the majority of decks so it has drawbacks.

In my opinion, if you are going to create these attachments, then they need to have a restriction so that they cannot be played on a quest card that already has a keyword. Otherwise, it could totally ruin the experienc eof some quests, such as Battle at Helm's Deep that is coming up. We don't fully know how it is going to work, so Im not sure what kind of effect it could have.

## 29 [MyNeighbourTrololo on April 10, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/145504-angmar-awakened-3-across-the-ettenmoors/?do=findComment&comment=1554215)

What I had in mind with this thought is monotactics solo. Just to enable it. Trained for War is not cutting it, it costs 2 virtually for nothing (you expanding your battle forces to quest to lack them in the combat phase then, and you're paying for it), and it's only one time.

## 30 [joezim007 on April 10, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/145504-angmar-awakened-3-across-the-ettenmoors/?do=findComment&comment=1555420)

Yea I completely agree with the intentions. Tactics has never had much chance on its own against most quests, and enabling it to permanently change the quest type is a great solution. I'm all for creating these cards, I just want to make sure they are designed in a way that they can't completely screw up existing or future quests that feature alternative questing mechanics, so it'd have to feature similar wording to Trained for War where it says "if the current quest has no keyword it gains...". Other than making sure that's on there, I have no hesitations toward making these cards.

## 31 [Gizlivadi on April 10, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/145504-angmar-awakened-3-across-the-ettenmoors/?do=findComment&comment=1555545)

Do you think there is a posibility of ever getting cards that vary in their effect depending on whether there are 1 or more players? So for example we have an attachment with two abilities. One must apply if there are 2 or more players, and another that must apply if there is only one player. This could be a good solution to making decks that are solo viable but that don't mess up the mutliplayer metagame or make it unbalanced. So for example the ability to make a quest stage permanently a battle or siege could only apply if there is one player, and another ability if there are more.

The quest card spoiled for lore does something like that- the more players, the more encounter cards you can check

I know, but I'm talking about an actual mechanic, two separate abilities. It is much more efficient for effects that are not quantifiable, like turning a quest into a battle permanently. I'm talking about very powerful effects like that. I think cards like The White Council are pretty bad for solo. They do so little it's just not worth a slot in a deck.

I like the attachment idea. It may have some weird, unintentional interactions with certain quests but none I can think of off the top of my head.

There is a spoiled piece of FFG artwork entitled "Dori" that someone found. People are assuming it is the art for the next "defensive" tactics hero. Seems pretty **** likely but we will soon see.

Like the one time the "new Glorfindel hero card art" was found for TBR?

It is a beautiful piece, VERY hero card worthy, but ended up being a boon.

Assumption is the mother of all f*** ups.

Yet I hope it is correct. We can use another dwarf hero in tactics.

We are also getting new mounts, ents and valour cards (one of which is Hope Rekindled)!

Cannot wait to see what the new ent cards are! Possibly just Wellinghall Custodian though.

It looks like Hope Rekindled is the first 0-cost song we're getting (excepting Ho! Tom Bombadil!). Since it searches for Valour cards with its own Valour Action, you could potentially chain it together to gain a handful of resources off of Love of Tales. Since you are looking at a high threat level and Valour, I think there's been some discussion of Lay of Earendil to help players control the threat -- and it's another Song!

 

Perhaps I will be building some two handed Noldor/Numenorean (Dunedain) decks around these 'Tales of Valour' after this pack hits.

Dori is the new hero in Ettenmoors.

Will: 1

Attack: 2

Defense: 2

5

 

Sentinel.
Response: After another hero is declared as defender, exhaust Dori to add his defense value to the defense value of that defender hero for this attack.

how do you know this..?

Also that ability is HORRIBLE in my opinion. Just does what a good defensive attachment does but at the cost of exhausting a hero.... Plus it directly conflicts with the fact he has sentinel. It isn't even till end of turn or phase so its literally +2 defense for ONE attack at the cost of exhausting a hero. Terrible.....

cannot believe that is the heroes actual ability... even if you load him up with attachments and he can give a +4 or 5 defense boost or whatever why not just use him to defend said attack?

For now I tend agree with psychorocka here.

His ability is not that great.

It could come in handy at moments, but that exhaustion cost is just too steep.

I would like him alot more if he had 6 or 7 threat & different stats with this kind of ability.

I see Dori as a half-StandTogether. You can't chose character to deal damage by extra attack over defense and it will be only 2 points of defense, no more, but the first problem of StandTogether is solved --> you have the action since start game forever ^^

 

Edited: I start thinking in Dori with Boromir and ready effects (Beregond + Behind strong walls) etc.

I were frustrated when Dori is only active for 1 attack

 

You can chose the character to who give the +2 defense bonus (Shield of Gondor is permanent on 1 character). And it is a good thing

 

PD: And Dori with Unexpected Courage or Miruvor, etc., continues being good. Despite you can't use his ability twice on same character

Not unique. 3 different characters you control (not unique only).

As it's been said, I can't imagine a deck or situation it would be beneficial to use his response instead of direct defense, maybe against some enemies like the hill troll, for example, when you don't want to recieve the consequences of non defended attack points?

Edit: first part corrected before by Asfaloth! And yes, he is a dwarf, it is easy to increase his stats but...I still don't see him in any of my most played decks.

I find it cool that we're getting a Dwarf hero, it's been a long time. The art is amazing. I certainly hope the pack contains an outstanding Tactics attachment that'd make Dori's ability worth something. Because as it stands, even a non-defensive hero like Gimli is better at defending than this guy. Man, it does not even target allies also, only heroes.

 

I also understands the theme behind it as Dori was kind of protective of other Dwarves and also of Mr Baggins, which was already depicted in ally Dori's ability. Kind of cool, but I still don't see the hero's utility.

First dwarf hero with centinel keyword

 

Text can be not too great, but we don't forget traits.

 

Traits start to be important. Card must not be considered only by his own. Dori alone, of course, is weak. But if we are aware of the synergies with other characters...the same card can be much more strong.

 

For example: dori + bombur + gloin

You can chose who defend with Dori ability, if Bombur (+ Burning Brand) when attack is very powerful, or Gloin (if attack is not so much powrful but anyway, the few hp and defense of Gloin is not enough). And you get the power of dwarf synergy: only playing 1 dwarf and you can get Dwalin or Bifur allies with bonuses; Gloin provides also with resources much easily.

I just thought of something. Can you use his action after the shadow card was revealed but before the attack damage resolves? So, if somebody got +3 attack on his shadow or something, you can mitiage this? Still not much, though, but something, if it works, of course.

Looks like a bad hero to me, maybe a good attachment for him will be spoiled and things will change.

Also, I think it's good to keep in mind nowadays it's shadows that really hurt you when defending: it happened plenty of times to me that I came close to losing or outright lost because of a shadow.

Finally, the restriction on a defending hero is disappointing, I was really expecting such an ability to be able to synergise with an ally.

So far, he looks somewhat like 2 Dunedain Warnings, even if the added flexibility is nice - but we're talking about a (10 threat) hero!

It just seems like super flexibility to me. In a 4 player game, he'll have plenty of targets for his ability OR he can straight up defend. He also gives you the ability to have extra defense before the attachments make their way into play as well as giving you more deck space if you prefer not to include defensive attachments.

I reserve final judgment until we have actually tested him but I do see some merit despite being somewhat weak.

That Headache Helm he seems to wear could be an attachment in this cycle that could possibly work with him making him way better, but at the moment he may be the most disappointing heroe in Angmar awakened.

It has been a long time since we've seen such a bad hero. Bad in the sence of what we get when you start the game.

He brings 10 threat with 3 useless stat points (his wp and att) and at least 1 stat too few in def.

He has sentinel, which is offcourse great.

Then he has an ability to boost other heroes, thus nullifying his own sentinel to combo with this. Also limited to heroes, while a Dwarf deck keys off on ally swarm and having the heroes as support...

Here's what I found on the site of the store Le valet de coeur in Montreal : 

Fortunately, the sixty new cards in Across the Ettenmoors include more than its scenario; they also introduce a new Tactics hero, who lends versatility to your fellowship's defensive efforts, as well as three copies each of nine different player cards.

Make him 1 WP 1 ATK 3 Defense and able to target allies and he would interesting: he could defend, take a few hits (considering the enemies/shadows we have now probably no more than 2-3) then play support mode until he would be healed.

Synergy with A Burning Brand is nice, but you need a Lore hero with at least 2 Def and possibly even Sentinel, to really be worth it in MP. Ad that's 2 Hero slots and a costly card you're devoting just to defend one enemy each round: it doesn't look good, in my opinion.

 

Compare Dori to Erkenbrand (clearly the best defender we have so far IMO): with a warden of Healing on the table, Erkenbrand basically has Shadow cancellation and Sentinel for one less defense, and he doesn't really need the Warden turn 1, since he can usually resist for a couple of attacks without healing.

If you need to defend more enemies, additional healing and an unexpected courage is all that it takes.

Dori on the other hand needs another hero to use his ability (that's 2 actions and hero slots spent), provides absolutely no shadow cancellation and it is much harder to make him help with more than 1 defense, since you would need a courage for both him and the target defender.

The only advantage I see for Dori is that he is a Tactics hero, granting in-sphere access to Feint and ohter Tactics combat tricks; however this is questionable, as sometimes Leadership might actually be more useful.

Of course if there is an unspoiled Tactics attachment that has something like: "after attached hero defends or adds his defence to another hero, discard a shadow from the attacking enemy" or "after ---- ready this hero" that would change things, but as it is now I see no reason to play Dori (even comparing to Beregond, Dori looks like a subpar choice). I'm almost certain we will see something to help Dori though.

 

The only real good thing in this new hero so far is.. the art. :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

Sebastian Giacobino surely is my favourite artist, at the moment.

The ability looks great to me. I'm pretty tired of the Dwarven Swarm and the need to chump block, so this offers the idea of maybe having a solid defender and going with more attachments and events. Even better if we eventually get ally Thorin and Balin and can do a company deck. I can see this guy going right into a Balin-Bifur (or Nori, to drop threat) deck. As others have noted, this could be especially good with a new attachment. Right now, you'd have to load up on ring mail.

 

My only issue is the threat value. Most dwarves are in the 8-9 range.

I agree with that. Dwarf trait needed some defense effect. Only Ring Mail was not enough.

 

Don't forget than you can boost de defense of Dori, and give it to the hero you pick. I see this ability better than the Dunedain attachment defense, paying 1 resource to change from character.

Very unimpressed by Dori.  I will probably never use him.  But, I could see him being useful in quests like Laketown where you have few enemies with high stats.  Him plus another defender could survive some big attacks.  Of course Beregond does the same thing in 1 hero instead of 2, but maybe you really want to play Dwarves?

Kind of underwhelmed; I'll still give him a try for the sake of giving him a try but I think for the most part he'll just be displayed in my binder. When the preview article said the hero would revolve around defense I was really hoping for the next Beregond or Erkenbrand. While the uses people have proposed may be ok, I can't help but think there's other player cards or heroes that could do the same thing yet better. The unspoiled tactics card hopefully helps him, but 1st impression is not great. A shame because I think he would be vastly improved if he even was just able to give his DEF to allies. He would be perfect in an ent deck. On color, and able to make your Derndingle Warriors absolute fortresses

If his ability was set to trigger after a shadow card is revealed instead of after a defender is declared, he would be pretty useful in multiplayer as a form of countering shadows, but that is unfortunately not the case.

There isn't an unspoiled Tactics card in this pack I don't think - Hold your ground! and Delay the Enemy are the two.

Got the pack.

 

In a few minutes I'll post some pics and descriptions (I have the Spanish pack), when I arrive home.

 

Saw the cards quickly. The unspoiled ones contain a new dwarf ally that plays with discarding cards from your deck (more Hidden Cache love), a new mount for Noldor and spirit chars and a Leadership attachment for quests.

Apart from being the first dwarf hero from Thorins Company that is pure tactics (there was none IIRC), there is nothing I like on him, more since I mostly play solo one hand. In my case in order to use his ability I must "play" with only two heroes and him to boost another one ... unworthy. There are two many heroes around that can do a lot better stuff. Bombur hero is way better being a lore character (Burning Brand) and counting as two Dwarves when using the Dwarf synergies, same def same HP. Really if he does not get an attachment that helps his ability it will be very difficult for me to use him

 

 

On the other hand I am very interested in the Noldor mount attachment

Whoops. Must have missed or forgot about it oh well.

The more I think the more I can see him providing some utility especially the more players you have, like if someone gets an enemy engaged with them unintentionally and doesn't have a decent defender, but as a mostly solo player not sure I'll ever see him at his best.

Honestly, thinking about it I feel like Dori's ability is potentially useful, but I keep coming back to the fact that you're using up a hero slot on it and I don't know that it's worth it given that. If he was an ally he'd be great, but I remain skeptical about him as a hero. Ideas are percolating though.

Ranger Supplies

 

Leadership Attachment - Cost 1

 

Attach this card to a Location. Limit one per Location.

 

Response: After attached Location is explored, the first player adds 1 resource to the resource pool of each of his Heroes.

 

 

 

Longbeard Sentinel

 

Tactics Ally - Cost 3

0 WP, 1 ATK, 2 DEF, 3 HP

Dwarf, Warrior

 

Action: Discard 2 cards from the top of your deck to give Longbeard Sentinel the "Sentinel" keyword and +1 DEF until the end of the phase. Limit once per phase

 

 

Imladris Steed

 

Spirit Attachment - Cost 1

Mount

 

Attach this card to a Spirit or Noldor Hero. Restricted.

 

Response: After attached Hero is commited to a quest, discard a card from your hand to put 2 progress tokens on the active Location.

 

 

Well, that's all. All the others were spoiled before. I like the Leadership attachment: an Ancient Mathom of sorts, giving resources to ALL your heroes. The dwarf, well, the idea of "mining" for dwarves is not that explored (IIRC, there are 5 cards now, counting this ally, Zigil Miner, Ered Nimrais Prospector, Well-equiped and Hidden Cache) but I like it, it fits on the theme and I love when FFG shows other aspects of factions (martial power of Rohan with Tactics, "engagers" vs "trappers" Rangers...) of Middle-Earth.

 

The mount, is good for the new discard theme of the Noldor, and if you don't play Lore is a good call. Otherwise, is a more restricted version of Asfaloth. Maybe more balanced?

Nah, Noldor discard from hand. Discarding from deck has precedence for Dwarves in Zigil Miner, Ered-Nimrais Prospector, and Well-Equipped.

The discard from you hand is also preparing us for the Lore hero of the next AP which lets you grab a ton of cards each turn and discarding your entire hand at the end of turn.

Now that is intriguing for a player like me, pure solo, not too bad but not too good either, I just don,t know what kind of deck I would build to play with this hero (and if I put 50, 70, 100 or all my 2000 cards in the deck...).

I may sound heretic -more since Spirfindel with Asfaloth is my favourite combo- but the mount seems a bit better as an option. It places two progress tokens whatever Elf hero you have, while Asfaloth does that only with Glorinel, it places one progress with other elves and also works with the new discard from hand thing introduced. On the other hand having this on Glorfindel together with Asfaloth means four progress each turn, so no more locations :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

Regarding this discard mechanism, i guess using Imladriz Stargazer would be of good use cause player will be able to choose card draw so as to have cards to play and discard.

As compared to Asfaloth, the mount is 1 resource cheaper, not unique, and can be attached to any Elf.  You need the cards to fuel it, but with the new Noldor style this should be a strong card and lets us escape Glorfindel a bit.

I think you're missing the main point. Asfaloth can progress any location, effectively clearing the staging area before questing, while this horse can only progress active location, and costs you a card for it. It's decent, I just don't think I'll be using it without splasing lore.

I love how subtle the flavor is. Dwarves interact with the deck and discard in a way that feels like "digging". That's why they have several effects that discard off the deck. Noldor are more like scholars searching through lore so they discard from hand. That is why they cycle cards more than straight draw them. They end up feeling like they have great knowledge, but it is passing away...

That Steed doesn't seem to have a limit. If you need to get rid of it, 3 discarded cards will eat through e.g. The East Bight - so long as it's not immune.

The way Jekzer has translated it, it's an effect that can be triggered after a character is committed to a quest. If the correct original text reads "after a hero commits to a quest...", I'm open to your interpretation. There's a semantic difference between the action and its following state.

The way he translated it, it's a response. Response triggers upon something taking place. So it can only be triggered once per character being committed to the quest.

Yeah, the Steed has a Response.

 

He could be a versatile attachment, being non-unique. But the fact that it acts on Active Locations only, limits its play.

 

I am sure that we'll need to revisit this card once Noldor is well established, because the discarding will interact with a lot of other cards.

If he didn't have sentinel I could see why his ability might be somewhat useful. The only quest I could see using him is in Shadow and Flame NM by pumping a hero's defense just in case Balrog gets the sahdow cards that will discard all their attachments. Other than that, seems pretty unusable.

So apparently Dori is not that useful for solo play, but I could see him as a supporter for another player's Dunedain deck in multiplayer. With an Erebor Record Keeper he could boost both Halbarad and Idraen to 4 DEF, which would make it much easier to keep strong enemies engaged.

I hate not liking heroes, and there are few that I genuinely dislike, and on top of that I like the idea of a new tactics, defensively-oriented hero, 5 hp, and a dwarf!
 

But!

 

I cannot see the wisdom in planning to use 2 heroes' actions for a single defense.  It sounds like an "emergency-only" move.  Surely we are in store for some kind of attachment that would ready Dori after he does his thing?  THEN I can see some utility.

 

(and for perspective, I play pretty much exclusively multiplayer... if I'm going to include a defensive hero and exhausting it for another player, I expect to take the full force of the attack so that the other hero can use their stats for something else)

I'm a relatively new player, but it seems Dori's ability allows a hero that has no business being a defender an opportunity to defend against an attack.  I can see this being more crucial in a multiplayer game than in a solo game, because some enemies will go after the first player and the first player may be ill-quipped to deal with such a threat at a certain point in the game.

But why not just buff up Dori as a true defender and make use of his Sentinel keyword instead? The only major advantage of his ability over a Sentinel defense is that you can use it to block really high attacks. So maybe use him as a Sentinel defender most of the game, then use his ability to help tank the boss?

One problem is that you have to use his response right after declaring the other hero as a defender. If it was a combat action instead, you could use him in case there is a nasty shadow effect that would otherwise kill the defending hero.

I can kind of see where they were going with him, the idea being flexibility in defence rather than just more defensive power - so if you get swarmed by multiple little enemies, Dori can defend one. Whereas if you have one big enemy to deal with he can combine with someone else to block it.

But seriously, seriously, why would they make his ability only work on heroes and not allies? That just makes it way too narrow a focus. Make it work on allies and he could see niche use when you want that kind of defensive flexibility (alternatively you end up using your defensive allies like non-restricted attachments for Dori, you could have some fun with that), but having it only work on other heroes... I'll probably still build a deck with him, I kind of have one in mind, but I'm not super-thrilled about the idea. (And again, it'd work so much better if he could target allies!)

I find myself in a situation for some days ago, when Dori would have helped me a lot. I was playing the dunland trap, and when the time value at the third stage ran out, I had none ally, a lot of ready heroes/cram, but none of my heroes was able to defend the Cheif wihout dying, so I was just going to win when I lost due to the death of Hama.

I really like Ranger supplies. I think it is much better than Tighten Our Belts in certain decks. I personally will be replacing all 3 copies of Tighten Our Belts with Ranger supplies in my decks. Yes it costs one as opposed to zero and you have to actually explore the location to get the benefit AND it affects the first player and not a player of choice HOWEVER it allows you to gain resources after the quest phase which can be very useful for certain cards such as the Brothers Elladan and Elrohir. Also it is a guaranteed three resources (four in Saga) as opposed to Tighten Our Belts which I often use for 2 and on rare occasions 1 resource if I have to and obtaining said resources does not require you to not spend resources that turn, you simply gain them when the location leaves play. Technically because you are paying a resource to use Ranger Supplies it really only gains you two resources however you do not need to save resources to gain this effect and you will always gain the full three resources. 

Now we only have it in Spanish and apparently it is just "attach to a location" and not the active location which means you could easily combo it with Asfaloth and can clear a location in staging and still trigger this card. You could therefore play it and gain the three (two) resources instantly if you are able to explore the location with Asfaloth during planning. If it is active location then I will probably stick with Tighten Our Belts to be honest..... heres hoping!

Lastly the art on Ranger supplies is really cool and fits in far better with my Elf/Ranger/Ent decks than Tighten our Belts does.

There are 4 objectives-locations with 2 keywords: guarded (we know it) and safe ('seguro' in spanish)

 

Safe: when a location with 'safe' keyword is active....

1. return engaged enemies to staging area

2. don't trigger 'when revealed' effects

3. secondary quests are as if text was blank

4. there is not forced engaments checks

 

... if there is so much helps... it sounds very very very hard quest

After looking at the cards I'm thinking: Gimli with Ent Draught + Boots + other HP cards. Put some damage on him, play Delay the Enemy and have him singlehandedly quest over the staging thread and active location. Purposely hold back (through healing if nessecary) to keep Delay the Enemy in play so Gimli can do all the questing and location exploring singlehandedly. Use other heroes to deal with enemies or draw cards or whatever.

 

Build up a force of Booming Ents and Vassals of the Windlord, play Trained for War on the regular quest and smash through it in one turn. Do you think this will work?

Interesting concept. What method do you plan to use to reliably draw a 1/deck card with all tactics heroes?

It's a pity Beorn hero is immune to player card effects, because Dori's ability would work really, really well with him.

I know that Beorn is immune to player card effects, but Dori's ability doesn't target Beorn, it target's the attack.  I would like to see a ruling on this as it seems the best use of Dori.

## 157 [John Constantine on September 4, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/145504-angmar-awakened-3-across-the-ettenmoors/?do=findComment&comment=1774701)

Um. It tries to modify Beorn's defense, therefore stumbling upon the immunity. You're trying to apply the case of damage that Beorn is about to take can be canceled, but, unlike defense (or damage that is already dealt), that damage is not a part of Beorn yet, so it can be interacted with via card effects. Defense cannot be.

Yeah, it was probably wishful thinking.  Trying to find something useful for Dori to do besides collect a resource.

I think Dori is just a nice new tactics hero for dwarf builds.    Just more options and a pretty neat ability.  If your mono-spirit player gets engaged with an enemy, being able to assist in their defense can be really useful, for example.  

## 160 [Seastan on September 4, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/145504-angmar-awakened-3-across-the-ettenmoors/?do=findComment&comment=1774888)

But why use Dori to boost another hero's defense up to 4 when you could just play Beregond and defend the attack yourself.

 

Edit: And I'm not sure what would be so great about combining Dori with heroes that have action advantage like Beorn or Boromir. Dori's effect is only for 1 attack, and does not stay around if you are defending multiple times.

If you've absolutely got to defend a massive attack and survive, Dori + Beregond starts at six and could get much higher with attachments.  I think Dori's ability is only going to be useful for multi-player and boss enemies.  He could make a nice tag team with Thalin as a tactics dwarf, swap in Dori for quests with fewer, tougher enemies and Thalin for quests with lots of squishy enemies.

 

It's a pity he can't buff allies, though.  I can't see him being much good in a solo one-hand deck until one of the following happens:

1) A hero that doesn't exhaust to defend and *isn't* immune to card effects.

2) Some sort of readying attachment that keys off taking no damage when defending.

3) Some sort of event or attachment that benefits for helping with a defense (this would also help Stand Together be more useful).

> 1) A hero that doesn't exhaust to defend and *isn't* immune to card effects.

 

Since Dori's effect only lasts for 1 attack and not multiple, would any kind of defensive attachment be better for this situation in almost all cases?

> And I'm not sure what would be so great about combining Dori with heroes that have action advantage like Beorn or Boromir. Dori's effect is only for 1 attack, and does not stay around if you are defending multiple times.

For cases where there's only one big defense needed, which I think is reasonably frequent.  Dori's 1 attack is negligible, so exhausting him for defense in itself isn't that costly.  But Dori + Beorn (if only it were legal) would have Beorn defending at 3+Dori's attachments, and still being available to contribute 5+ attack.  Most enemies are going to be one-and-done while doing little damage to Beorn.

 

Dori + Boromir would defend at 4+both attachments, then for 1 threat Boromir could contribute 3 attack to killing the enemy.  That's one threat worse than combining Boromir with Beregond, but gives you four restricted slots for potentially buffing defense instead of two.  And I hope there's some spread between being as good as Beregond and being useless.  Spirit heroes shouldn't be coasters if they aren't as good as Glorfindel.

No, any kind of defensive attachment would be better in this case if there are 2+ defenses to be made.  If there is only 1 defense to be made (or only one dangerous attack), it would be better to put the defensive attachment on Dori, giving the benefit of the attachment plus Dori's native defense.

 

In the case of Beorn, if his card said "cannot be healed" instead of "immune to card effects", Dori would rock, since he can have attachments and Beorn can't.  Sadly that's not the case.

I think the reason Dori is subpar is because Dwarves can be quite powerful, and defense is one of their weakness. Now, what you can do is use Dori with Dain, and Dain has a 5 defense, which can be used in a pinch, and for smaller enemies, you can use Longbeard sentry. In the meantime, focus on ramping up dwarves to quest, and that should be a fairly competent dwarf deck that can be played solo as well. 

 

Just a thought.

I am not going to say Dori is useless - I don't think any card is completely useless. But I think what we are trying to do here is find a good use for him - some situation where he shines - and back and forth discussion is one way of trying to come up with one.

 

Dori represents to me an extremely limited version of Stand Together (Stand Together allows any number of your characters to join defense, even allies, and applies to all attacks made during the phase, not just 1). Stand Together has been widely viewed as a mediocre card for quite some time, so I am skeptical on Dori's usefulness, but that's not to say I've given up.

The fact that Dori is not an attachment could itself be important depending on the quest. The best example in the game right now might be NM Shadow and Flame, where your super-defender's attachments are not guaranteed to stick around and chump blocking is a risky proposition.

 

Also, hero buffs like Dori's don't require you to draw them. Having the effect available on Round 1 every time is solid, even if it isn't always needed.

 

I wonder if they would have made Dori a bit stronger if he were not a Dwarf. As mentioned in the Second Bfast article, he and the new Longbeard help address one of the few weaknesses of the trait. If they did the defensive job too well, then we'd be back to complaining about how Dwarves are too strong. I hope they play around with other variations of his ability. It seems like a smart way to design new defensive heroes without reprinting Beregond's stat line.

NM SaF crossed my mind as well. The Firey Sword could put an end to this though. And so much of your resources are going toward this combo it leaves little remaining for the other aspects of the quest. But if someone has tried this and succeeded I'd certainly be interested.

It's a bit of a shame, because I can think of so many ways in which this Dori hero could have made more sense in 1-2 player games:

 * If Dain boosted dwarves' defense, it could be an interesting way to pass that defense off to non-dwarves
 * If dwarves had access to some efficient defense-boosting attachment (like say a cost 0 +1 def restricted attachment for dwarves only) then it could be a way to "pass on" those restricted slots to a non-dwarf hero
 * If Dori were Gondor (for some reason) he could make better use of the Gondorian Shield than a non-Gondor hero, and then pass that benefit on
 * If we had an easy way to ready Dwarves (or Sentinels) you could spare his action and then ready him up to do it again
 * If he could apply his bonus to allies as well as heroes, we wouldn't be having this discussion

But I have to say I've been thinking about Dori a lot more than other heroes lately, so I must find him interesting. He's a puzzle all by himself.

 

I'm sure in practice he's perfectly serviceable in 4 player, though.

Dori seems ok enough. More multiplayer focussed but he has the type of ability that might just combo really well with future cards. I'll have to keep my eye on him for the future.

Some ideas for this:

- Berevor/Erestor and conventional card draw

- Word of Command and an Istari

- Leadership and the new sidequest search card

(these concepts involve the tragic death of the non-tactics hero before the final push :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png])

- The new defender dwarf that let's you mill your own deck and Gandalf (Hero)

- Defender dwarf and the prospector to mill your deck, then return the sidequest to your thinned out deck

 

or with mono-tactics

- Hama and Trained for War

- Hama and that tactics-card-draw

- Trained for War and the book that recycles tactics events

 

The big question is how much time do I have to set it up, if I can't quest well but CAN kill everything fairly easily? Will I get location-locked or threat-out too easily? For multiplayer I think this deck has MUCH more potential, as you can do the fighting while others quest.
