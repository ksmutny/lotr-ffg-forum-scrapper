Some characters are unique, that's ok.

Some items are unique, that's ok.

But why "Hardly leadership","Visionary Leadership" and "OLorien!" are unique?

They would be over powered if not unique.  For instance, three copies of Hardy Leadership would mean all dwarf characters have at least 4 hit points.

Yeah, think of unique not just as a thematic property, as it is for characters like Arwen, but also as a necessity for game balance.

That's because people will follow only one leader, and if someone already singing - it's pointless to interrupt him with the same song.

The second part made me lol. It was obviously an important part of the design process. Perhaps all songs should auto-discard the last one played...
