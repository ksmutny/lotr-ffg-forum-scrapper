If Heirs of Numenor is like Khazad-Dum, we should get 3 new player cards per sphere, plus one no-sphere card like Boots of Erebor.

In Khazad-Dum, the heroes counted as player cards.  That is, if we got a hero in a sphere, we got one fewer player card for that sphere.

So, what do you guess we will see?  What color will the other hero be?  Who will it be?  Will we get an ally for each of Spirit and Leadership?

 

Here's what we know so far:

 

Tactics:  We know all 3 tactics cards

Hero - Beregond - 10 - 0/1/4/4 - Gondor. Warrior.  Sentinel.  Lower the cost of each Weapon and Armor attachment attached to Beregond by 2.

Ally - Defender of Rammas - 2 - 0/1/4/1

Event - Behind Strong Walls - 1 - Action: Ready a defending Gondor character, who gains 1 defense.

 

Lore

Ally - Ithilien Tracker - ? ?/?/?/3 - Gondor.  Ranger.  Action: Exhaust Ithilien Tracker to lower the ____?____ enemy added to the staging area ___?____ end of the phase.

 

Spirit

Attachment - Blood of Numenor - 0 - Condition - Attach to a Gondor or Dunedain hero.  Action: Discard 1 resource from attached hero's pool to give attached hero +1 defense for each resource in its pool until the end of the phase (limit once per phase).

 

Leadership

Event - Title? - 0 - Action: Choose a Gondor hero.  Add a resource to that hero's resouce pool.  (guess based on the back of the box)

_____?  ______?  (Mark Assists?) - Event - I think this is different than the event above, since the art appears different.  This appears to have Rohan and Gondor flags, while the one above seems to have something burning?  I have no idea what the flag event does.

I was thinking the same about the numbers. And then it is disappointing to think we shall only get three cards per sphere. But it is probably right. I feel we shall see Faramir as a Leadership hero. I'm quite bad in guessing what the ability shall be. The event with the flags might be Red Arrow, would be nice to get Rohan + Gondor synergies, as well as Gondor and Dúnedain (trait) synergies, as suggested on the Spirit event.

I have been always most excited about the player cards for this game, but with HoN I am really looking forward to the new mechanic, hopefully changing the way Tactics have been shafted in solo play mostly. (I know this is an old tune repeated by many, I am saying it without grudges…) Anyways, I am looking forward to seeing quests with fighting but not felling big foes only, I think it would be nice having to overcome odds in amount of enemies, those quests usually seem pretty thematic - especially as the storm is coming from Mordor.

Spirit

Attachment - Blood of Numenor - 0 - Condition - Attach to a Gondor or Dunedain hero.  Action: Discard 1 resource from attached hero's pool to give attached hero +1 defense until the end of the phase (limit once per phase).

 

 

 

Even better:

Attachment - Blood of Numenor - 0 - Condition - Attach to a Gondor or Dunedain hero.  Action: Discard 1 resource from attached hero's pool to give attached hero +1 defense for each resource in its pool until the end of the phase (limit once per phase).  

Where can I find the second leadership card???

Thanks for the correction!  Here's where I found the leadership card with flag art: http://fantasyflightgames.com/edge_npm.asp?epmi=s&eidm=157 [http://fantasyflightgames.com/edge_npm.asp?epmi=s&eidm=157]

seeing as we are getting battering rams coming at us, perhaps the player cards could have our own siege equipment…..? though im not sure how this would work in other non-siege quests..

mind you it doest have to be massive trebuchets…..more like flaming oil that type of stuff

I thought it was something else but now I think that Rohan/Gondor flag event is called "Helpful Alliance"

I think you are right about the word "Alliance."  You could be right about "Helpful," but I am not sure.  It still kinda looks like it starts with an M to me.

Hopefully we will get another spoiler on Tuesday evening.
