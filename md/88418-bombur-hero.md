"When counting the number of Dwarf characters you control, Bombur counts as two."

 

Do you think that I can use his ability for this 2 cards?

 

Erebor Battle Master

"Erebor Battle Master gets +1 lotr-icon-atk.gif [http://deckbauer.telfador.net/assets/cardgames/icons/lotr-icon-atk.gif] for each other Dwarf character you control."

 

We are not idle

"Action: Exhaust X Dwarf characters to add X resources to a hero's resource pool and draw 1 card."

My guess is you would be able to use his ability on the Battle Master, but not on "We are not Idle".

P.S. How did you get the cool attack symbol?

With "Idle" I have doubts too...
