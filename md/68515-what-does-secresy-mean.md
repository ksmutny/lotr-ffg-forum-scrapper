 Not the word of cause ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] but in the game? Or more specific, What does it mean to have a secrecy deck? I'm not sure I understand the strategy/terminology behind this. I haven't really played KD expansion yet or the Dwerowdwelf quests. Is it something introduced in these packs? Anyone?

secrecy is a card mechanic that allows great discounts on cards with the 'secrecy' key words as long as your threat is below 20….it hasnt been expanded much on unfortunatly..hopefully soon

It was introduced in the RedHorned gate I think… anyway… all the instruction sheets are available in PDF to download…

Secrecy X Keyword


Secrecy is a new keyword introduced on player cards in
the Dwarrowdelf Cycle. Secrecy lowers the cost to play
the card by the specified value, provided the threat of the
player who is playing the card is 20 or below. Secrecy
only applies when the card is played from hand, and never
modifies the printed cost of the card.

If a card costs 5 resources to purchase, you can purchase it for 3 resources instead if you meet the secrecy requirements.  It has potential, but I've not fiddled with it much.  Most of the cards don't seem altogether useful to me or there are just other cards I'd rather have.  As others have said, they might build on it more and it could be interesting.  I'm also a person who likes to use three heroes and secrecy decks requires less heroes or very specific heroes and is too restrictive for me at the moment but that is just me.  Many others have some nifty decks they use and some day I might try one.  I'm very content with the ones I'm using now.

 Okay. Thanks for clearing that out :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] looks like I'll be opening my KD and Redhorn packs this weekend then.
