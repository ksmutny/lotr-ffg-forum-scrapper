Playing Steward's Fear the other day, I realized the Underworld Dissident's shadow effect does not specify which progress token to remove: progress or resource. This matters a good deal, since the latter is required to advance in this quest as opposed to normal progress tokens. Doesn't this typo mean you can choose which type of token to remove? I don't think this is a big deal at all, but any thoughts?

Since it doesn't specify, if there are different tokens present the first player should choose.  So I guess I should start putting progress tokens on 1B and 2B, just in case!

It seem intended to be resource tokens. But you are right: without specification you can choose!
