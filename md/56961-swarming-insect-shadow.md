The shadow effect on Swarming Insects reads: 

Shadow: If a character (including Wilyador) has more damage than each other character, deal 3 additional damage to that character.                                        

So, it will deal 3 damage to whichever character already has the most damage (usually Wilyador). Note, though, that if two or more characters are tied for the most damage, the shadow effect will do nothing (as no character will have more damage than "each other character").

No, it's not a typo. It means that the character that has the most damage (in 99,99 % that's Wilyador) when the shadow effect is dealt gets 3 points additional damage. If there is a tie for the character with the most damage, you don't have to deal any damage. Note that enemies are no characters.

 

To make it short: annoying card.

It's from Rhosgobel, what else is new demonio.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/demonio.gif] ? Exhaustion (man, when Necromancer's Reach starts looking good, you know things are bad), Festering Wounds, Swarming Insects (real killer as Treachery, those 1hp allies just vanish), etc.
