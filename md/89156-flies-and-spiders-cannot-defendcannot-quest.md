"Unconcious characters cannot defend."

"While Forest Stream is the active location, poisoned characters cannot quest."

 

Does this mean I cannot COMMIT/DECLARE characters/defenders, or that the actual questing/defending is made impossible?

Example: You have declared a defender who is made unconcious by a shadow effect, or you have commited characters to the quest and Forest Stream shows up.

1. If you have an unconcious hero he can't defend.

2. It isn't until Forest Stream is the active location. But yes, when it is the active location all unconsious characters can't quest.

1. That was my own first sentence (not talking about heroes though), so this is of little help. Would the attack be considered undefended in that case? Same question was asked here: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/1025953/character-turn-into-unconscious-during-enemy-attac [http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/1025953/character-turn-into-unconscious-during-enemy-attac]

 

2. It says all POISONED characters can't quest. Imagine Forest Stream is the active location while Lazy Lob deals one poison to every character commited to the quest. Is their questing power ignored then?

The way you responded to my answer, wrong as it might have been, rather than helping you any further I'll let you find out on your own. Politeness is the key here laddie.
