This one trolled me pretty hard too.

Well played... though not terribly original at this point.

Especially when we had about 5 announcements in July and August, this lack of news is not particularly disturbing at all, and rather premature.

I kind of like it when there is no news. It allows me to focus on digesting the already huge amount of "new" content that I have. To be honest, I think that FFG is a little bit trigger happy on the spoilers and news. It's kind of crazy that we know what the 2nd pack of the Haradrim cycle is and we are just over halfway through Dreamcatcher cycle! 


Almost a full deluxe and and chapter cycle ahead on news as it stands.
