Hi guys,

Just got game not long ago. I think I got rules down ok. Been just playing the preconstructed stuff in core set to get used to cards. I have one question on attachments. I know in the planning phase it let's you play allies and attachments. Is there any other time I can play an attachment in any of the phases. I was wondering if I can play it during any of the action windows in the phases. I had an ungolian spawn engage me. At the end of the encounter phase you can play action. Was wondering if I can play a trap attachment on the spawn at that point. Thanks.

No - attachments and allies only in the planning phase.

Â 

Events in any action window (unless the card gives a more specific restriction, eg "Combat Action" or similar).
