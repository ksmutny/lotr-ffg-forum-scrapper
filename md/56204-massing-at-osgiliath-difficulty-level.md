Does anyone know what the difficulty level of The Massing at Osgiliath is supposed to be?

To the best of my knowledge, the only thing we've had to go off of are the ratings given by FFG staff at Gencon 2011, which was either 8 or 9 - the package itself doesn't actually list any official difficult level, so we can't be entirely sure.
