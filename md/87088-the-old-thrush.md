His texts is:

 

Response: After attached hero exhausts to attack Smaug, discard X cards from hand to reduce Smaug's (defense) by X.

 

The question is: Smaug's defense is reduced until the end of the phase or ever since response was activated?

Good question.  I assume it is just for that attack, that's  the way I play it, since it does not say anything about until the end of the phase, round, or game.

Yes since is responce is only work for current attack resolve
