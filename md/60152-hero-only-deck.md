# [Hero only deck?!](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60152-hero-only-deck/)

Sat around and thought, then made a deck. It hast no allies except Gandalf in it. 

Played two games of Massing. Won one and lost one.

Anyone tried this? I wanted a deck where no poor Snowbourn Scout had to suffer just to save some Hero scum.

My Heroes were: Boromir, Bilbo and Frodo. I will try one with Aragorn instead of Boromir.

i havnt tried this, it certainly sounds a challenging situation- being without sacrificial allies to use as defenders,

i could see you getting over ran quickly

saying that it sounds like a cool theme look at things- especially in emyn muil or places where you wouldnt take alot of people

Man...
That was a simple - yet awesome - idea.

 

I'll make a quest where you cannot play Allies.
I loved it! (my players probably won't, but that's not my problem)

When I read the title I thought it was about a deck containing all of the heroes. serio.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/serio.gif]

 

What about the opposite - a deck that includes allies only?

Resources will be a problem in this one. Could work with Gloin and Daughter. 

Will try one tomorrow. There are around 14 one or two cost allies. Put also Gandalf and the Daughter in it and that may work.

 

Had one game with the only Heroes variant. Had 14 attachments on my heroes.

Then I had an undefended attack, from some crows.................and lost all my attachments.

You should play KD and have some fun instead of chasten yourself. All those dwarfs are waiting for you and you ban* them?

Just wanted to chime in and say that I think this whole idea and conversation is wonderful.  gran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif]

I have not had nearly enough time to play the game recently, but this is inspiring.

I played around 6 KD games so far  with a dwarf only deck.......very interesting.
