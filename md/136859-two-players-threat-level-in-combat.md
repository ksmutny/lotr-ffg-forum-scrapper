A question about the threat level.

We are two players, A and B. Player A threat level is 35 and player B is 30. 3 monsters are in the staging area with 33, 34, 35 threat level. So during the encounter phase the 3 monsters will jump on the player A, but what can do the player B if he dosent have any range or sentinel stuff?....

Maybe I missed something..

Before engagement check, each player have 1 optional engagement.

So player B can optionaly engage one of the three.

Player A can also optionaly engage ome, but he will end up with the two remaining.

Still player B can help with his heroes or allies that have Sentinal for defending or Ranged for attacking
