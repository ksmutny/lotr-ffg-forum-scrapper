Hey, real simple question that I can't seem to find on the FAQ, probably because it's very obvious. Do you control the facedown eagle attachments on Eagles of the Misty Mountains? Or are they a different kind of attachment since you didn't play them?

I've always played so but don't quote me on that.

No, you don't control them in the meaning that you cannot use those eagles to anything, since by the text on Eagles of the Misty Mountains [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Eagles-of-the-Misty-Mountains-RtM] those cards have left play....

 

Or am i missunderstanding your question?

Yes you do control them. If any encounter cards as a treachery force you discard attachment you control you can choose and discard your facedown eagle if you like

Yeah I think Glaurung's got it.  You're asking because some encounter card effects say "discard an attachment you control," maybe?  Yes, you can discard a facedown Eagle attachment to satisfy that effect.

Yeah, that was why I was wondering. A shadow effect kept popping up making me discard an attachment I control, and I was wondering if they were a valid target.
