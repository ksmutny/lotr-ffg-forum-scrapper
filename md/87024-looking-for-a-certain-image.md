Hey guys, I just wanted to ask you if anyone knows about that little Eye of Sauron icon that appears on the quest log, anf if anyone knows where of what it's from... It's the one that appears in this image:quests-compare-quest-list-%20copy.jpg [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/ffg_content/lotr-lcg/news/lotr-log/quests-compare-quest-list-%20copy.jpg]

Anyone know where can I get a better resolution version of this Eye of Sauron?

never seen it- it may have been an alternate version of the back of the encounter deck. if you type in lotr lcg you can see several images that were never used.

Looks like is a part of the Necromancer reach card from the core encounter set Dol-Guldor orcs.

Yep, it looks like a zoomed picture from that card.

Well, it seems like it IS a closeup of the Necromancer's Reach illustration. I would never have noticed, thanks a lot. By the way, does anyone else think that this image would have made a much better card back for the encounter cards? Maybe I'm the only one, but I completely despise the back art they chose for the encounter cards. Not only it is an exact copy of the eye of Sauron of the movies, but it is IMO too flashy/bright and distracting. A more sober and subtle (and original) version of the Eye of Sauron like the one on that card would have been so much better I think.

ive said this on several forums- i strongly believe that the eye of sauron was a complete metaphor, which is backed by passages in the book, so yes i agree its straight from the films.

 

but as it happens i dont mind the backs, i have gotten used to them, and the orcs did have the red eye on their banners and so on

I'm not talking about the "concept" of the eye of Sauron, I'm talking about it's visual style. The way it looks on the encounter card backs and the threat dial and so on (which was apparently adopted from Middle Earth Quest) is obviously inspired (very heavily at that) on the movie depiction of the eye of Sauron, which was unique to the movies. Before that every other depiction of the eye was in a more old-fashioned, "non photoshop" style (look at the card backs for MECCG), and the fact that they pretty much copied the eye from the movies really bugs me. And of course the eye the orcs had on their banners was probably more like a simple symbol, not this bombastic depiction. Sorry for nitpicking, but this is one of my biggest pet-peeves about this game.

of course, i was just stating why i personally didnt like them at the start, but have since come to like them rather.

i have never seen the other card game backs, so i will have to go and have a look at them so i can see what you mean

Just because it's one of those very lazy days and because I'm bored, I made in Paint for my own amusement my own version of what the encounter card back should have been. What do you think? Apologies to Anna Christenson for having manipulated her art.

I like it!

Well yeah, I liked how it turned out. Now if only FFG would make sleeves with this image! That'd be great.

Pretty similar.  I would hardly tell the difference if I played with those.  Very good though anyways  :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

It's not that different because it still had to match the player card back, so I kept the borders at the sides, but I changed the "movie eye" for a darker, more sinister looking one, which is, oddly enough, an original creation commisioned by FFG. Why didn't they use that in the first place, I cannot tell.
