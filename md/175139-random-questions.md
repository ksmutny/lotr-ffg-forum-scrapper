Hello everyone,

 

I'm working on a custom set and I have a few questions about your play experiences of some scenarios.  If you can't answer all of them, please just answer as many as you can.

 

1) About how many Dead Villagers do you have at the end of a game of Encounter at Amon Din?

2) About how many Dead Villagers do you have at the end of a game of Nightmare Encounter at Amon Din?

3) About how many turns does it take you to complete The Massing at Osgiliath?

 

Thanks! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I can only answer question 3. In straight solo, every time I have beaten Massing at Osgiliath, it has been in 13 rounds (using a 50-card deck built from Core cards exclusively). In solo 2-handed mode, every time I have beaten the same scenario has been in 10 rounds. Talk about consistency!

Depends on whether or not I brought anything to keep Ghulat from attacking.  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I typically write a little narrative in my quest log, so let's go back and see...


 

1) About how many Dead Villagers do you have at the end of a game of Encounter at Amon Din?

 

1- ?? rescued vs. 7 dead at end of game (loss)

2- 13 rescued vs 15 dead (loss)

3- 3 dead vs 20 rescued (win)

4- 5 dead vs 15 rescued (win)

5 - 8 dead vs 8 rescued (loss)

6 - 2 dead vs 22 rescued (win)

 

That's all of the games I recorded.  It varied a lot!

 

 

2) About how many Dead Villagers do you have at the end of a game of Nightmare Encounter at Amon Din?

 

Never played it.

 

 

3) About how many turns does it take you to complete The Massing at Osgiliath?

 

Can't even guess really, I only just bought it this year and beat it once.  Quest log didn't tell me how many rounds it took (I usually don't count).
