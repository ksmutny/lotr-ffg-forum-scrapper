## 1 [John85 on September 27, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/71842-hon-known-card-list-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=701180)

*UPDATE 10/02: Apparently no one (over at BGG) is very interested in just a list of cards, so I've added the card text when available (inferred text [in brackets])
I've begun a list of KNOWN CARDS in the new DE "Heirs of Númenor" over at the FFG Forums (herehttp://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?e… . I've decided to repost and update it here also, since there are folks who play that aren't in that forum too. NB: I'm keeping a list of ONLY KNOWN CARDS, not hypotheticals.

 Where did you see some of those cards, like Beregond?

 

It seems you missed on treachery card (visible on Heirs of Numenor page) and the Leadership event is called Mark Assists.

 

I can only see:

On web site:

Protector of Rammas, tactics ally;

Mark Assists, leadership event;

the treachery card whose name can't see well;

 

On first announcement:

Behind Strong Walls, tactics event;

Battering Ram, enemy;

 

On second announcement:

Stage 1B The Defense of quest The Siege of Cair Andros

The Citadel, Location;

Siege Raft, enemy;

I left off several Encounter sets intentionally, because I didn't know how to refer to them (I suppose I could use the symbols for reference and makeup a name).  *I'll add other posted cards to the OP later when I have a moment.

I mentioned Mark Assists in the initial post.

Beregond is on the back of the box (posted in another thread), along with the other Leadership event I referenced (as ???); someone has also posted the full card (albeit in French) on a recent thread. This same card is on BGG (where I have provided a translation).

Most of the other cards come from the image on the back of the box OR the About section on the HoN minisite OR the two posts from FFG (Battles and Battlegrounds and Heirs of Numenor)

btw. sorry I'm not using the acute accent on u in Numenor, it drives me nuts to leave it out, but there seems to not be and easy way to include it on the boards.

Add "Orc Crossbowmen" to "Siege Tower" - Enemy.

Does anyone know how to edit an OP multiple times?  Nevermind, I worked it out.

I know you said "nevermind," but I thought I'd share what I have to do to edit my original post: reply to my thread.  Then, the "Edit" button reappears on my original post.
