I've started playing games on OCTGN to scratch that co-op itch, but it usually takes over an hour for someone to join. Is there a Google+ group, or some semi-hidden sub forum somewhere where people coordinate OCTGN games? I don't mind waiting, but I'd love to be able to reduce the wait time as much as I can. Thanks.

There is the COTR Discord Channel where you could meet up with people. I'm not familiar with how to send invites to that channel, can someone else do that?

Another idea might be searching for regular players/friends on BGG or here or on Discord and then coordinate privately

Do you have an adventure in mind and a set of heros you woud like to use?  I can come up with another deck.

Sorry Bunstan, I thought that may have been you when I asked winco44 for the game.  I'm still available for the rest of the weekend.
