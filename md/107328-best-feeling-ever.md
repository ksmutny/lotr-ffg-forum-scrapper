Inspired by DurinIII's "worst feeling ever" topic.

Best feeling: buying a new pack with a card you've been eagerly awaiting, unboxing it at home and mixing it into your deck.

And winning a difficult scenario, of course.

What's your best feeling in this game?

Almost every goddamn AP in this new cycle has cards I'm eagerly awaiting to mix into my decks. Because of how long they are taking I'm using proxies though so it won't be very exciting anymore.... the new quests will be though!

Making changes to your deck then playing several quests and noticing the difference in power and your deck working better than before is a pretty awesome feeling.

 

Same with beating a quest you haven't beaten before. My first times beating Dol Guldur and Siege of Cair Andros were epically rewarding.

Playing The Battle of Five Armies solo, with a pitched struggle going back and forth, never sure if I would achieve victory. At the very end, nearing defeat, I decide not to give up but instead play it out. After blocking the enemies that I can, there is one left which must go undefended - an attack that will kill a hero and seal my fate. I flip the shadow card and the Misty Mountain Eagle kills the attacking enemy. With my heroes alive, I barely manage to kill Bolg the following turn and win the game, all thanks to the perfect timing of my eagle friend. That was definitely the most tense, thematic and perfect ending to an amazing game.

The most good moments in this game for me are when 4 players play a hard game and we win. I love epic wins in 4 players mode.

Many may scoff but every moment with this game - even the frustrating moments - is simply superb. Nate and Caleb have truly created an immersive game with sound mechanics and dripping with theme.

But the best moment is: when i buy an adventure pack, i open the box and i see the new cards, card per card, 1minute per card behind 1minute per card ^^.

 

PD: without seeing any spoiler, neither the new-notice in the ffg. :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]  (in the past it could be possible, now not, impossible, i always know all the spoilers, lol)

I couldn't agree more Mndela! Ever since the MTG bug bit me in the antediluvian days, opening packs, boxes, etc., has always been a sort of ritual. I like the "one minute per card" approach by the way. I tend to rush at 20 seconds per card! :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

I just had it today and I talked about it in another thread [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/107460-celeborn-galadriel-aragorn/?p=1102230] but I'll say it again here:

 

I was playing a deck with Celeborn, Galadriel, and (Lore) Aragorn. I got Sword that was Broken, Legacy of Numenor, Steward of Gondor, Gaining Strength, and Naith Guide on the first turn. Played LoN to get 2 resources on everyone. Played GS on Celeborn to have 3 and played StwB onto Aragorn. Then played SoG onto Aragorn (who now is Leadership thanks to StwB) then used SoG to pay for Naith Guide.

Spent 7 resources (with 2 left on Galadriel) on turn 1!

Then quested for 10 while only exhausting Aragorn:
Aragorn = 2 + 1StwB
Celeborn = 3 + 1StwB (no exhaust thanks to Naith Guide)
Naith Guide = 1 + 1Celeborn + 1StwB (no exhaust thanks to Galadriel)

 

I still barely won that game(Hunt for Gollum) - even though I was never felt like I needed more power - because I had a Clue with a Hunters from Mordor on it... then proceded to draw another clue, which was guarded by... another clue, which was guarded by another Hunters from Mordor! That's16 threat just from the Hunters! Failing that questing brought my threat up to 48! Thank god for Strider or I wouldn't have made it past the next refresh phase (I had OHaUH Gandalf out, so it woulda put me over 50).

Jozim007: wow! What an epic game that sounds like! You enjoying the soon-to-be published new cards? I haven't proxyed them yet myself.

I've forgotten what that feels like.

Oh my gosh yes! The action advantage is amazing with Galadriel, Naith Guide, and OHaUH Gandalf! Galadriel keeps the new characters up and Naith Guide keeps the heroes up. Wingfoot + Henemarth kept Aragorn up. This is the first time I've ever played a Spirit deck with fewer than 3 Unexpected Courage cards and you really don't need them. The only reason I have them is so I use both Galadriel's action and Nenya's action in the same round, rather than choosing one, but honestly, with Sword that was Broken and Celeborn, you rarely need Galadriel's willpower. -1 threat and an extra card each round is plenty good for me, especially when you have Gandalf. Once you have a good resource generator (Steward of Gondor), The Tree People's "cost" of returning an ally to your hand is actually a good thing, since you can easily afford to play it again, and then that ally can be buffed up again and not need to exhaust to quest that round.

At the moment I would have to say the end of the last game I played (I may still be grinning like a loon). Stage 3B of A Knife In The Dark and the whole thing is going to heck in a hand-basket. Frodo is only alive because of Bill The Pony, everyone else is injured and Beravor can't do anything but draw cards because of a Black Breath on her. Also I've got the Witch-King down to three wounds but he's wreaking havok. Going into the Refresh phase I exhaust her and draw Surprise Attack and Core Gandalf. I don't have any Leadership resources but I do have a Errand-Rider to move some from Eomer in the other deck.

 

Suffice to say, Refresh phase Istari  FTW  :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] .

So what happened? Witch King is immune to player card effects, so you coulnd't have killed him with Gandalf.

Well darn it. I'm just going to go and cry somewhere.

Also can't move resources from other decks to yours via Errand-Rider:

 

>  
> 
> Action: Exhaust Errand-rider to move 1 resource from the resource pool of a hero you control to another hero's resource pool.

 (emphasis mine)

 

Unless you were saying that the Errand-Rider is in the deck with Eomer...

 

 

...

 

 

Or can anyone trigger the ability meaning that "you" refers to the triggerer?

This is what happens when I play with cards I don't usually use (Errand-Rider).

 * Doing a hail-mary trying to quest out of a super difficult final quest card with less than 3 heroes combined at threat level 45+ (in 2 player), ah nothing beats that.



Cracking up a newly arrived pack of cards and taking a whiff of the brand new card smell, mmm.



Realizing you will threat out/lose next turn but then drawing exactly the right card you needed to save yourself at the start of the next turn.



Feeling your jaw drop to the floor looking at a new spoiler/preview article of an unreleased expansion/adventure pack.

The brand new card smell of Road Darkens was almost salivatingly good!

## 22 [Noccus on October 17, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/107328-best-feeling-ever/?do=findComment&comment=1302757)

Aaah yes, the smell of new cards! Love it.

I always sniff the cards when taking them out of the plastic.

Thought I was a bit odd like that, but apearently I am not the only one.

Here's to all the card sniffers!
