amazing……whats everyone else think, overpowered? boring? underwhelming?

 such a simple ability, but not to be sniffed at by any measure

Really good. Dain-lite, but able to attack and defend without sacrificing his global buff. Only downside is the fact that he'll be competing for space against the other version of Boromir, which is also exceptional. 

Needs a deck built around him (obviously), but that shouldn't be a big issue. He's a stud.

 He's a bit like a Gondorian Dain character, although his ability could be better, since it only relies on unspent resources. I like it very much: it's pretty thematic for Boromir, it's a simple mechanic, and it does make the Gondor allies kicking around already that bit more punchy.

And as a plus, it doesn't seem overpowered to me.

I find him 'okay' at best.

Outside the battlefields where ATK is WILL, he won't be bringing too much to the table. I hope for more Gondor 1cost allies, because I really want to like new-Boromir. Otherwise, he is only 'okay'.

Neat. Still the Tactics Boromir really is do good that it will be a very hard choice. I am sure the Leadership version will prove invaluable in some of the battle heavy quests but for now I think I stick to the ever ready version. 

## 11 [Narsil0420 on November 20, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/74561-new-hero-preview/?do=findComment&comment=726073)

I love the new Boromir! His art is a huge improvement, first off. I also really like the mechanic of him only inspiring Gondor ALLIES. Boromir impresses his people but he's not someone to impress the likes of Aragorn or other heroes. That fits really well, thematically, for me. Also the fact that he needs resources to do it adds a hint of corruption to the ability (to my mind) which is, again, perfect for Boromir. Finally all those Guard(s) of the Citadel will see some play!!!

I also really enjoyed having some insight into the design process. Especially compared to the the other ideas, the Battle and Seige keywords really are an elegant mechanic to add to the game! I love that instead of adding something extra to the game, they're using the pre-existing structures of the game (questing and location exploration) in a unique and thematic way!

I'm so freaking stoked for this now, even if I have to wait until after Thanksgiving for it!

## 12 [Mighty Jim 83 on November 20, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/74561-new-hero-preview/?do=findComment&comment=726085)

I can see the thematic nature, which is nice (like Boromir v1)

right now, I think this card is pretty mediocre, because of the very limited range of Gondor allies out there, although obviously, we'd expect to see that grow a lot over the next cycle.

Biggest disappointment about this, is the fact that it pretty much guarantees no Faramir hero in the box (I assume it's two heroes again, and they've already spoiled Beregond) typical big brother hogging the limelight.

## 13 [John85 on November 20, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/74561-new-hero-preview/?do=findComment&comment=726088)

Agreed… was hoping to see my favorite character (Faramir) as a hero… although I LOVE his ally version right now (questing beast)…

 

I actually think this version of Boromir is FAN-FLIPPING-TASTIC.  Or can be….

With his top-notch attack numbers and solid defense ability, he of course becomes an instant candidate to lead the battle/siege quests…

Combine him (Leadership) with his father, Denethor (Lore), who has excellent defense (+3) and thus a great selection for siege battles, and include Beregond (Tactics, 4 defense) for even better defense and siege abilities, or Eleanor (Spirit, Treachery swap/discard) for lower cost and the access to Blood of Numenor (for even more defense).

Of course, we expect to see a decent number of Gondor allies through this next cycle, so his ability will only get better, making both the attacking and questing (during battles) that much more fluid.

With his  Leadership affiliation, this makes "For Gondor!" (+1 attack/defense) an instant-include into his decks, and his ability means that even the Horn of Gondor will see renewed usage (and Steward of Gondor will of course remain a mainstay in every deck)…

This might be one of the things I like most about him: his ability itself works with the pool of Gondor attachment cards we already have (small though it may be), and he makes the 'For Gondor!' event even more powerful. He may not be the most powerful hero - although the lack of Gondor allies will, of course, be fixed in the same box he comes in - but he fits so neatly into the sparsely developed theme we do have for Gondor so far. Excited!

 My biggest concern with the article is the fact that it implies that these new mechanics (battle/siege) are only for one expansion + cycle.

 

Which means that the previous mechanics (secrecy) are also only for one cycle - which is okay in the case of battle/siege, which can be applied as it makes sense. But secrecy is the kind of deck building concept that needs constant support throughout the life of the game to maintain (or arguably to become) viable.

 

We really need secrecy keyworded cards to be released at a reasonable rate (2-3 per cycle, + 1 per expansion perhaps) to make it a viable compared to just having 3 heroes. Otherwise it will become increasingly poor.

Alternatively more fetch cards (that are cheap) might make it work better, even just a cost 0 or 1 card that said, search your deck for a secrecy keyword card and put it into your hand. (This would enable you to increase the hit rate on important cards before you go over 20 threat).

 

Edit: On the other hand I really like the look of this expansion + cycle, I think it will be great, but I was hoping for more sustained support rather than bursts of support for one theme then another.

 Sounds like a good set……… Very gooooooooood seeeet!!!

What i like about HON: encounter cards is quite powerful but players cards is quite balanced and less power then before. which is good, cose we have already a lot powerful players cards from the last sets. sounds like this will be a good challenge for advanced players also.Also i really like the idea of Battle and siege questing.  Cannot wait!

As i say  before we need to forget about secrecy for now. Maybe is coning again in the future but not in this cycle.

 Another cost 1 ally! Fun! He can lament with the Snowborn Scouts about always being cannon fodder. :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

Actually, it looks like a useful ally, so maybe not so much with the dying for the Errand-riders. SoG plus the cheap Errand-riders allows for some really nice resource manipulation, which really looks to be a Gondorian theme. Which is awesome.

## 26 [monkeyrama on November 21, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/74561-new-hero-preview/?do=findComment&comment=726445)

 Actually, Gondor looks like it's all about resources. The new Boromir requires them, Blood of Numenor gets better the more resources you have, two attachments give resources from Gondor, characters reduce in cost via other characters being in play, you can move resources around, or just get them straight up through an event, plus the Master of Lore can help cut costs for lore cards. Very, very nicely done theme, and we haven't even got one of the APs yet.

Yeah, several of those cards have really nice synergies with the new Boromir and the Blood of Numenor attachment. Also, take a look at the Envoy of Pelargir--it's essentially a 1/1/0/1 for 1 resource in a Gondor deck. If you're using Boromir (which you are), it's 2 attack for 1 resource. That's crazy good.

 Love the new Boromir and the artwork. Absolutely love Magali's work and even though the character doesn't look as rugged as I've always imagined him, I love the pose of him high up in the white city looking across the plains. Granted I was really looking forward to a hero Faromir, but I guess I can wait. Looking forward to the new deck compilations this set will require

I bet your are right. Faramir might make it in Steward's Fear, though Denethor would be nicely thematic. I guess Denethor will be hero #4 who get a second copy. We should have a thread about what sphere the hero Faramir shall be. Maybe Lore to go with the new Rangers? Spirit is a stern candidate also…

## 31 [Pharmboys2013 on November 23, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/74561-new-hero-preview/?do=findComment&comment=727025)

 I agree that thematically Denethor makes the most sense for the first AP obviously but I can def see Faramir being in the 2nd. I can see him tracking enemies through the forest; or at least I'm hoping we won't have to wait more than 2 APs for a fan favorite 

## 32 [Glaurung on November 23, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/74561-new-hero-preview/?do=findComment&comment=727029)

Yes Faramir Lore with some traps, snare and rangers will be quite cool thematically.

Interesting you mention a fan favourite. I have not seen any such polls recently but it does seem people in general (and maybe Tolkien himself) favour Faramir over Boromir (and many others, of course). For myself, Boromir has always been a far more interesting character, though I certainly felt for Faramir also.

I don't have the reference to hand, but I believe that Tolkien did in fact state that Faramir was the character that he most identified with.

Yes. I have heard the same. And it is quite a good choice as Faramir does show a great spirit. For me it is probably the rough deal Boromir get to strongly identify with the character, and his redemption. I have heard/read also that the redemption of Boromir was very important to Tolkien as a writer.

Yeah, indeed. It is a very humble statement by mr Tolkien. And thanks for the quote. So it was not exactly his favourite but closest to him.

 bahh i'm caught between wanting to see the rest of the cards and art now just to satisfy my impatient desires or to wait until i get my box in and its all new and a surprise!  its been such a long stretch between the last set of new cards (not counting battle of lake town) its all just so refreshing and exciting
