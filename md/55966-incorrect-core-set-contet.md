# [Incorrect Core Set contet?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55966-incorrect-core-set-contet/)

Hello folks,

I just realized that my Core Set came with 4 copies of Lore of Imaldris and 4 copies of Lorien Guide which I would consider a mistake, since its only allowed to play 3 copies of a card. Also, regarding to a list I found here www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/core/ [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/core/] the quantity should be 3.

Also the deck sizes are different. Spirit + Lore both field 38 cards (including a Gandalf each) whereas Tactics and Leadership only field 35 cards. Am I cards missing?

Regarding the content of the Core Set, I only found a list where I could look up specific cards and their quantity in the set. This way it would take me ages to figure out if or how many cards might be missing from my set.

Regards and thanks for any help in advance.

It seems you have been quite lucky. Each sphere should only feature 29 cards, I believe.

I agree with lleimmoen. In the core set, each spere has only 29 cards each. Sounds like you got some extras :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Thanks you two guys. I'm glad I don't have to count every card to find out if any are missing ^^

I think you still need to check your card lists because you may have some extra cards from several cards but still miss some other cards...

Thats what I was suspecting from the start TBH. But I couldnt find a detailed description of the core sets content anyway. Looking up every single card from that list I postet would be a horrific task to say the least :S

 

Anyone got such a list at hand?

lotrlcg.com <- hit just "core" at the "All Expansion" drop down menu
