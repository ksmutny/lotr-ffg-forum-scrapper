So is it possible to play Dwarven Tomb on a Hasty Stroke after shadow card has been revealed but before it resolves?

Nope.  Hasty stroke has to be played immediately when the card is revealed.  Dwarven tomb requires an action window.  Of course if you are worried about the shadow card, you could play your Dwarven Tomb before you reveal the shadow card.
