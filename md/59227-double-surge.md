Drew the Black Forest Crows, and then drew the Black Forest Crows as the "surge" card...do i draw a 3rd?

Yep. From p.2 of the FAQ:

"Surge, Doomed, and Guarded keywords should be resolved any time the card on which they occur enters play..."

So, the second set of Crows will also surge. Should that surge effect reveal another set of Crows, those will also surge, and so on.

yes unless otherwise states all card effects must be carried out....so a second surge would always trigger

Unfortunately, the crows were the least of my worries. Getting past the Hill Troll (playing Journey Down the Anduin Quest) was my #1 priority.
