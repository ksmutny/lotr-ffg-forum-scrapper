wow unopened, that's sad man.

I would honestly recommend breaking that into pieces and selling it. I cannot imagine someone diving into the game for that much of an investment. Even if you break it into cycles, you'll probably get some interest.

## 4 [dojimaster on November 10, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126752-sadly-im-selling/?do=findComment&comment=1328605)

Thanks guys. YES, sad.  Too busy, and no one I know will take the time to play a card game.

Most people I know will not take the time either. Which is why I rate this game so highly. Super to play solo.

Sad, but I get it: there are so many games, we have to prioritize.

I always try to remind people that a general rule of gaming is that the more intense the learning process, the greater potential for fun later. Games that are super simple are a little bit of fun now, but games that are complex are quite large amounts of fun that continue on for a long period of time.

The advent of the computer wiped out many folks who might otherwise have gravitated towards gaming.  I can recall at age 12 going down to our game store and learning how to play a revolutionary war game with 11mm (?) miniatures.  It was hard but amazing.

 

Today, too many people just want the app.

And yet there's a resurgence of boardgames despite the computer! That gives me hope!

What I'll never understand is why someone would spend so much money on something they don't use

Money is a relative thing - I would assume it wasn't too much money for someone that bought so much without getting around to playing at all.

Foolishness in my case. I am ever hopeful I will convince someone (friend or family) to play.  My work schedule and demands don't help either (Optometrist, own my own practice, ridiculous hours some weeks).

Lol an optometrist? What crazy hours can you possibly work running an eye clinic prescribing glasses??

Why you would buy the newest expansion pack (which just came out) when you already have a TON of u played stuff (including the CORE SET) makes no **** sense in the world. Unless you have money to burn. In which case perhaps you should tone down your self empossed ridiculous work hours and enjoy life a little.

There is much that goes on behind the scenes and after hours in health care, 7theye.  Much paperwork and, since he owns a private practice, insurance companies to deal with.

Lets see: I have over 47 different insurance panels I'm on - constant rule changes and issues to fight with them on so patients lke you can be seen and have your care covered - that doesn't happen automatically . I treat glaucoma,  do minor surgical procedures, manage traumatic brain injury therapy, practice orthokeratology, have 10 employees , have to keep the federal and state government happy meeting all their regulations. I see about 45 patients a day,  get to the office by 645am every morning, rarely leave before 6 pm, then I get to go home, finish all my medical records, make sure the practices bills are paid, make sure any correspondence to referring doctors is done, keep on top on payroll , try to keep on on all my profession reading and continuing education,  and about 50 other things I am too tired to type out.   You see, if I had just a job, I'd likely work 40 hours like anyone, since I own and run a business, I have to do all that OTHER administrative stuff when I'm done seeing my patients.   

 

Oh, and I do prescribe glasses, but that's maybe 1/3 of my practice.  I add that since that's all you seem to think my profession is, but you are wildly incorrect.  As for the last pack, I had it on pre-order weeks before I decided  to sell my stuff.

 

I am quite certain you know a lot more about LOTR LCG than I do.

 

As for my profession or the demands on my time, you are well off the mark.

Strange how he just wanted us to know about the opportunity to buy off a whole collection and then suddenly had to defend himself regarding as to 1) why he sells the collection, 2) why he bought it in the first place and 3) why he is busy at work.

 

I mean seriously guys, give him a break. And thanks dojimaster for letting us know, it is a pity you did not find more time to enjoy such a great game.

Nice of you to say - but I really didn't mean to rail on like a victim. I just was put off by the comment that how could you be so busy.  

 

Even that was probably not meant as an attack, but I already have have a wife and mother-in-law, who needs more criticism here?  :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

@ 7theye - sorry if my post was overly hot (tried not to be) - I wish I had better life - work balance, and am very sorry to miss out on what looks to be a great game.  I do enough stuff alone that solo play isn't attractive.

 

Please accept my apology if I came off as attacking you.  Happy gaming.

My biggest struggle (well, maybe not biggest, that's a bit melodramatic, but *a* struggle) is finding time to play LOTR in between work and everything else. I think I play maybe once or twice a week (in a good week). Feel your pain, I really do! So some time ago, I made the (hard) choice that LOTR was the only LCG or CCG I'd play.

 

And man, owning a business sounds like hard work!! (rewarding, I hope, though)

I will not complain about my work hours no more...

The only thing I find strange and apologies if it sounds rude. But how do you have time to write 350 posts on a publishers game forum but not have time to even try a game from said publisher!?

Its not hard taking 5 mins during work really... why are people trying to shame the OP? People are allowed to not play our precious game ya know. Or are they so out of touch with reality that they think forum posting takes any kind of effort?

I don't think you need to apologize, but it was good of you.

I hope in the future (some years from now when you have more time perhaps) you'll be able to find time and people to enjoy games with.

Post #1 - no time for THIS game, not all or any games, but my time is finite, so if no one will play with me... 

 

Post #4 - can't convince anyone to try this game

 

Post# 10 - computers have affected most people I know - they won't play cards games

 

Post #16 - I don't have MUCH extra time, but I might get to play one or two games a week.  I have a busy job, a wife, 2 kids, all their interests to consider as well. So if I'm only getting 1-2 games, it can;t be what other won't play.  More of that time has been going to painting minis than playing games.

 

 

350 posts since Jun 2010 is very little. This took less than 2 minutes to type.  And no, your statement isn't rude.  But can you begin to see why I'd sell (and did sell)? My hope for playing this game finally ended.

 

Finite time, no willing play partners, no solo play interest = time to move on.

 

Happy gaming!

You're making fair points. I still think you're really missing out by not even trying it. Anyways, happy gaming to you too.
