1.  Do I raise my threat if I draw this during set up?

2.  Do I raise my threat if I draw this prior to an opportunity to commit to questing?

Thanks

1. If setup states: "Reveal and add to staging area", then yes, you do.

 2. Yes, you do.

Thank you.  That has been the way I have been playing it, I was just hoping I was playing it wrong.  Nasty card when you are trying to avoid nasty enemies or are very close to 50 threat and are trying to sneak out a win and you have many allies on the board.
