Were an excellent idea that have been spicing up my decks lately.  I just built a voltron sarumon deck using the one ring, the grey wanderer and attaching strider on him immediately.  It's a lot of fun. 

 

Do we know if contracts are only for this cycle? I hope not - I really enjoy the variety

Like any player cards, contracts are allowed to be used against any cycle.

Yeah,  i was asking if they'll continue to make new contracts in future releases. Wasn't clear,  thanks

There is no future. This is the last cycle.

Supposedly the end of cycles marks a hiatus instead of The End.  If/when we get future player cards past the last cycle, there's no structural reason they couldn't have Contracts.  In fact, since Contracts don't go in a deck, new contracts could be included in a Print-on-Demand product.

The future is uncertain but there is going to be a break after this cycle.

If/when it returns it’ll be a new iteration of the game, suggesting a different expansion approach, likely no cycles but maybe deluxe style expansions.

I must admit I've struggled in true solo using 3 of the 4 released contracts against Wrath and Ruin. (I think it's a difficult quest solo anyway even without contracts) so I'm back to going against the quest without a contract. 

 

I used fellowship, then multiple attempts at Burglars turn then the Grey wanderer a few times. 

I think the concept is great but feel there isn't enough benefit against the core concepts of the game, I.e

Draw one card per turn

One resource per hero per turn

Need threat reduction 

Need questing

Need defense

Need attack

Cancel or deal with archery. 

 

In the wrath and ruin quest you need all of the above from turn 1. 

I feel the drawbacks of the contracts are a little too severe especially Burglars Turn which prohibits any attachments in your deck or duplicates in the treasure stack of only 14 cards. And the cards are randomly pulled and only played if you travel. It's not so much as a thematic boost as a thematic nightmare mode. 

The wanderer sounds and feels thematically brilliant but starting with one hero is still massively handicapped even with the b side of the quest. 

Maybe in multiplayer they shine but for now they are more a novelty than a winning strategy .

I think they should have made them a little bit more like Decipher's Star Wars CCG events, double sided purple ones. They gave new strategies to old worthless cards that didnt work in the game any more. 

This lcg is full of binder fodder cards that'll never get used (the end comes springs to mind) or cant justify deck space. Contracts could have fixed that by changing how certain cards work.

Well there are other newly designed cards that have brought old binder cards to life. Just look at Lothiriel; suddenly we want to include ally Damrod, Denethor, and all kinds of other niche allies in our decks!

Not to mention she also makes old heroes like Leadership Imrahil and Tactics Eomer much more tempting.

Radagast and Radagast's Staff are other recent cards that have shined new light on creature allies (eagles in particular with Gwaihir's Debt), while Saruman and his staff have entirely reinvigorated the generally duds Doomed cards. 

The Burglar's Turn is the first thing to really make Guarded player cards viable since their inception, while also making cards that mitigate/facilitate traveling more valuable.


I think the designers have been doing an exceptional job of creating new content that breathes life into old and underserved content.
