# [Nin-In-Eilph Playthrough Experiences](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125582-nin-in-eilph-playthrough-experiences/)

Received my AP today, after a few attempts our heroes were able to make it out of the terrible swamp and i thought it might be good to recap my experience and create a place for others to share theirs.

 

I played with a friend.  I used the Gandalf-Elrond-Glorfindel deck i was running through the road darkens with because i didnt want to hold up our playing time with making a new deck.  My friend used a silvan Haldir, Legolas, Celeborn deck armed with the new archer ally and bow.  1st play through ended fairly quick.  Our first stage 2 was "a forgotten land" where we could only play 1 card a round.  Didnt seem so terrible on turn one when we didnt really have the resources to play cards anyway, but as we got behind on questing and locations, we were unable to play enough cards to counter the encounter decks response by the time we had switched stages we were already landlocked with a myriad of effects hindering us it was useless.  Onto attempt 2. Second time we realized questing hard was really the way to go. The quest feels like one of the more classic LOTR quests where low threat and will power go a long way.  Since we realized there are only 7 enemies aside from the ancient guardian, we felt more comfortable sending most of our characters on the quest.  (and the swamp adder has a decently high engagement level at 35 which helps)  Our stage 2 was much better too, started at "no end in sight" where we could not use player cards to gain resources or draw cards neither of which was overly detrimental.  We were able to pass that stage before the time ran out.  Our stage 3 was the impassable marshland which might be the worst of the 3 options giving each location plus 1 threat. We struggled to make enough progress especially with the treachery that adds 2 to a locations travel points popping along the way.  In the meantime the ancient marsh dweller started getting pretty huge eventually getting up to 6 resource tokens before we felt comfortable engaging him and taking him out.  We ended up traveling to "a treacherous swamp" quest stage twice in a row which wasnt terrible with only alowing 5 characters per player to refresh.  After we finally passed that the end encounter was the ancient marsh dweller again was quite simple and we defeated him with ease

 

Recap: Really enjoyed the quest, felt old-school with the emphasis on willpower and the harsh punishment for high threat (Nalir and his terrible effect accompany you again and unlike trouble in tharbad there are no quest mechanics that make his threat increase easier to bear...infact its quite the opposite as you need to raise your threat on every quest stage change).  The encounter cards really combo together in a terrible yet satisfying way that still made it a challenge especially playing the first time and not having a sound strategy.  The ancient marsh dweller can get nasty but is easily dealt with as he's not immune to player cards or anything so once you're set up you can chump then take him out without issue.

 

Let me know if you have questions on the quest and share your experiences too

To be honest I dont really interesting with that quest since I pretty sure that quest like a most of the quest of that cycle we forget very quick. Dunland trap was ok but after all quest looks boring for me. Players card is ok but for quest I will wait until nightmare will come. Just only interesting about last one for now since is always awesome.

After briliant and powerful players cards in Road Darkens this cycle looks like walk in the park!

Plenty of questions considering no one has posted any encounter spoilers even though quite a handful of people seem to have the quest now...

 

What are the effects of the other various stage 2 and stage 3 quest cards you didn't encounter?

What other enemies are there other than the swamp adder, ancient one and neeker breekers?

Is the Nalir ally identical? (exact same effect and art)

Was Sinking Bog (the one that punishes you for item attachments) much of a threat/hassle or fairly easy to overcome?

 

Thanks heaps for the overview by the way. Don't mean to sound rude or anything with the first line of my text I'm just sick of spoilers taking so long to come out for this game all the time even when lots of people actually already have the cards. Other than a few key people no one really bothers to put spoilers up and everyone just keeps stuff to themselves. I know if I ever get my hands on a pack before spoilers are up I'll personally take pics of every card and put them up. Living in Australia this will never happen though. Many thanks to those who do describe quests and post spoilers for this game like Beorn and yourself and the grey company guys.

@psychorocka

 

 

For stage 2, each of the 3 stages all have 13 quest points, raise your threat once revealed and have a time 3 effect of forcing you to advance to a different stage 2 (you lose all progress).  The unqiue effects are:

Each player cannot play more than 1 card each round

player card effects cannot be used to gain resources or draw cards

in order to commit characters to the quest a player must first discard a card at random from his hand

 

For stage 3 each stage when revealed raises your threat by 1 and adds the ancient marsh dweller to the staging area (regardless of if its out of play or engaged w/a player) and heals all damage to it. Each stage has 16 quest points with a time 3 forced effect of traveling to a different  stage. the unique effects are:

Each player cannot ready more than 5 characters during the refresh phase

each enemy in the staging area gets -20 engagement cost

each location in play gets +1 threat

 

And then for what its worth the 4th stage returns the marsh dweller to the staging area again and it makes an attack against each player. It requires no progress and after you kill the dweller you win. Has a time 2 effect of having the dweller making an immediate attack against each player.

 

Nalir is exactly the same in every way (really hoping we ditch him in the next quest ha)

 

There are no other enemies. 1 copy of the marsh dweller, 4 of the adder, and 3 of the neekerbreekers.  Worth mentioning that that the encounter set itself is pretty small. Only other set it uses is the "weary travelers" one which only had 3 different treacheries.

 

Sinking Bog's hassle factor has a large part to do with your own deck construction (aka how many items you run).  For the most part items are weapons or armor so you're not really attaching them to your questing characters which is the main concern.  The defense and attack reductions stink, but once you get enough allies out you wont need to worry about it. For example my friend had Haldir decked out with the new bow and rivendell blade...but had a -2 ATK because of it so it basically negated the effect of one of the items, so our original plan of killing the dweller while he sat in the staging area didnt work, but since there are only a handful of enemies if you have a few attacking characters you're ok.  I think its best to probably just let that location sit in the staging area and deal with it.  The key to this quest is questing hard and fast so with 1 threat level but 5 travel points and the fact the ability doesnt stack, it can be overcome

I remember thnking Trouble in Tharbad was brutal when I saw the cards before actually playing the quest, so I'll reserve my judgement there, and just say that you'll need a lot Test of Will for it. Another thing, in the lore the Nin-in-Eilph was called Swanfleet because there were a lot of swans. Sounds like a very peaceful and nice place to me. Does any of the art depict or show any swans? I know this is supposed to be a challenging scenario and all and obviously they wouldn't make any swan enemies, but I hope that for once they showed some of the gentler aspects of Middle Earth and not just orcs and dangerous places and eldritch creatures...

By foul craft, Saruman has bred swans with Goblin men...

 

The result is most terrifying.

When was it called Swanfleet though?  During the second age?  Plenty of time for marsh to develop and turn into a bog if so.

Hmm, I don't know, but I will just assume those ancient marsh dwellers ate them all.

The Swanfleet (Sindarin [http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Sindarin] for Nîn-in-Eilph) was a marshy area in Eriador [http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Eriador].

Formed where the Glanduin [http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Glanduin] (mistakenly labelled as "Swanfleet river" on some maps) joined the Mitheithel [http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Mitheithel] (Greyflood), the Swanfleet was effectively an inland delta, with uncertain streams and a very uncertain difference between land and water.

It was about fifty miles in length from west to east and over twenty-five miles from north and south.

 

It strongly resembled the Gladden Fields [http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Gladden_Fields] on the other side of Misty Mountains [http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Misty_Mountains] (Hithaeglir) and as such many Stoors [http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Stoors] felt right at home here after their migration into Eriador. These Stoors remained here until the Great Plague [http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Great_Plague] nearly wiped them out, and the remainder then went to the Southfarthing [http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Southfarthing] of the Shire [http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/The_Shire].

Near the Swanfleet was a ford over the Glanduin, from where led a road to the ruins of Ost-in-Edhil [http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Ost-in-Edhil], the ruined city of Eregion [http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Eregion].

 

from here: http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Swanfleet [http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Swanfleet]

 

Doesn't sound like a pleasant place!

So after three play throughs I think this quest is fairly easy. You can turtle stage two in order to blast through three and four quickly. It's probably the easiest quest of the cycle including the VoI box. Some good player cards though so I'm not disappointed by any means.

Fun quest!  I brought decks that were a bad fit for it and still almost won, so it's not terribly hard, but it was nice and thematic.  The quest cards and locations make it feel like you're struggling to progress through a swamp, and the Marsh Dweller gets nasty in a hurry, especially if you're drawing treacheries that remove time counters. Fun, middle of the road quest for when you feel like playing something that has good theme and a little bit of everything

Let's see some more multi-player reports because that often shifts things (makes it harder)

I've played this quest a number of times with a number of different decks, and I'm having a really tough time beating it. Even with threat reduction in the decks I have been threating out, or heroesq die because of treacheries. The encounter deck can punish you for having lots of allies, it can also mess up attachment deck strategies too. Each stage 2 effect always messes up my plans. And getting to stage 3 can also be problematic especially when enemies might get - 20 engagement cost.

I have not tried any of the real power decks on it, but I don't believe this scenario is super easy. It's got a small encounter deck that's pretty unpredictable in how each game will play out with the changing scenario cards. Overall, I find it interesting, and am having a challenge coming up with a good deck solution, but maybe I'm just rusty. I have not tried a silvan deck on It yet, but I'm thinking Galadriel hero will make a big difference on this one for me.

Wow.  I've only tried one deck (superhero attachments), but I really didn't think it was very hard.  Now I'm worried I missed something...

This, quest looks really easy to be honest…. More problem is looks boring. To be honest I dont really like any quest of that cycle….. Last cycle was amazing , that cycle sounds like a step back in quality. VOI deluxe still ok but from lasy cycle I really likw only Dunland trap. Very unique quest but after first one next quests looks boring for me…. Even nightmare cannot really change it since idea and story dont make me existing. Wait for next cycle actually

I haven't beat it yet but have only tried Celeborn/Haldir/Legolas. Not enough willpower. I'm glad it's not too easy to start off.

Not so bad but nothing really special. We still love and play second and third cycle quest or even core set quest ( like Anduin) but im pretty sure this cycle quests will be quickly forgoten. Imho anyway

The quest is difficult and requires special deckbuilding. For solo play, Eleanor is a good choice as you can build her up as a defender, and she can also negate all the nasty effects of the treachery cards. However, I don't think that the encounter deck is too difficult to handle, but thequest card effects can be brutal, if you don't have a fitting deck. Building a mono sphere deck sems to help to master stage 2. I made one with lore and tactics, and both are able to get you out of the swamps regularly.

I would agree with leptokurt's assessment - I haven't found the encounter deck itself too difficult, its the quest card effects that are making the scenario hard for me to beat.  The 2A stage that limits you to only one card per round is particularly tough.  If you play an ally or an attachment that means no response cards later in the round (Test of Will, Sneak Attack come to mind).  Location control is also important once again, as the locations either have pretty high threat (many are 3) or a high quest point amount to clear (4 or 5 points).  The locations in and of themselves aren't particularly bad but the limitations of the various 2A cards can make them far more difficult to clear than they ordinarily would.  I find myself getting location-locked as a result because the quest card effects prevent me from getting through them.

 

I've been playing the scenario strictly one-handed but should have a chance to play it multi-player later this week.  It'll be interesting to see how it plays with more players.

Yes, I agree with the above. Encounter deck does not look like any thing to difficult, although certain cards can be problematic, but quest cards are what make the scenario more difficult, and the random order of the quest cards can make each game different making strategies for winning a bit different each game. I have not played it since my last post, but when I get a chance again I'm going to run Eleanor in the line-up.

Just beat it second attempt but just barely. I don't find it overly easy so far, somewhat challenging in fact.

The locations pile up super quickly and without player cards that help against locations you are more or less screwed unless you can generate very high willpower quickly. Also if you don't kill the Marsh Dweller on stage 3 (I had it on 2 hitpoints....) its resource tokens remain on stage 4 and it is a much more formidable threat. I had it at 8 attack strength and also had it reveal TWO shadow cards that cause an additional attack during its forced attacks as part of quest stage 4A. I cancelled one with a Hasty Stroke and lost 3 chumps... (the exact amount of ready allies I had available). I then used a Feigned Voices on it during the combat phase to stop it attacking and killed it in one hit with Legolas (Bow of Galadhrim), Haldir (2 Dunedain Marks, Rivendell Blade, Bow of Galadrim) and Elrohir who had a combined attack of 15 (It was engaged with tactics/leadership so +2 to Haldir from the bow and +1 to Legoals from his). I may have smashed the Marsh Dweller fairly easily (and the other two enemies are fairly easy, did not have one survive the round it was revealed and no ill effects triggered on either attempt I had) and lost the first game mainly due to location lock but the Marsh Dweller is no joke and the quest overall seems difficult enough to me for an AP halfway through a cycle. It isn't the terribly last hard one or fairly hard second last one or one of the first two which are normally fairly easy.

Had a very fun time playing it and will definitely return to this one to get a better score, experience the other quest stages (some seem much harder than others) and simply because it was a well designed, challenging and fun quest. Definitely harder than Trouble in Tharbad and The Three Trials (for my decks and play style at least) but easier than the Dunland Trap, To Catch an Orc or The Fords of Isen.

Also found a pretty cool combo in my decks the second attempt I had. I attacked a Giant Swamp Adder with Haldir with his special Combat Action before enemy attacks resolved and he had an attack power of 8 (Bow of the Galadrim, Rivendell Blade and a Dunedain Mark). This left the Adder on 1 hitpoint and I then defended with a Gondorian Spearman who provided the last point of damage killing the Adder before its attack resolved.
I've taken out enemies previously wounded down to 1 hitpoint with a Gondorian Spearman's ability many times before and have also slain MANY a foe with Haldir's ability before they are able to attack but combining both abilities against an enemy with a particularly high combined defense and hitpoints (9) slaying it before it could attack was pretty **** satisfying!

I'd love to play more often with Haldir as a solo player, but his ability is just too unreliable to me.

I've been playing with a deck someone else made (on this forum I think) with Glorfindel, Haldir, and Merry, which is pretty epic in the current Road Darkens quests (always low threat!) and showcases Haldir pretty spectacularly. His weakness is that your threat has to be super low at all times if you're playing solo. An awesome hero though.

I beat it with a Celeborn/Haldir/Glorfindel deck [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/126152-leadership-galadriel-and-children-of-the-sea/#entry1318683]. The increased willpower is really what made it work. 

I really like the quest and the random stages coming out. Definitely increases replayability for me. Also liked the extra "surprise" at the last stage...

Haldir works best if you pair him with another deck that has high threat and gets benefits off engaging enemies, Mablung is a perfect example. You have that deck engage all the enemies and Haldir never has to worry about not being able to use his ability.

Yep Ive played it a few times with some decks not designed for it really, just decks that have fared well against other quests in the cycle, and have had a tough go.  Only easy win was with Gandalf/Elrond/Glorf, but that deck can prob take on anything.

 

Silvan has trouble with WP as you basically have 2-3 turns usually to make 13-16 progress. Global WP boosts might be a must on this one, with decent attack, dont need a TON, just need to be able to must 7 a turn to be safe after a few rounds.

 

Tracker1 send us a deck to stomp this one!  Maybe using Mablung :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Lost on our first try tonight.  We handled everything pretty well, as my Idraen-Glorfindel(Sp)-Denethor deck was heavy on location management.  The other deck was Strider-Balin-Beravor, with Wingfoot on Beravor for extra fun.  We got lost a few times on stage 2, but once we got established we had the table pretty clean. The Marsh-dweller engaged right away on stage 3 as we got the -20 engagement cost quest stage.  There was another marsh snake thingy engaged with the Beravor deck, and this was the downfall: a treachery caused time counters to be removed from the quest, prompting an attack from the snake.  With no ready defenders, this meant we lost a hero.  The shadow effect caused an additional attack, and we lost another hero on that side.  Then, the quest phase resolved and we went to stage 4, so the Marsh-dweller itself attacked (didn't see that coming!), eliminating the Beravor deck by eating its last hero.  That deck had Nalir, who then went out of play and we lost...

 

I tried putting some tactics in, so the "Beravor" deck is now an Aragorn(Le)-Balin-Beregond deck, and we'll try it again in a few days.

Just beat it with a Gondor all ledership deck with Boromir, Sam, Balin(allies are all Gondor).  Has a lot of WP with Faramir, and with all the allies when the boss comes hes not too bad to deal with.  Balins Shadow Cancel helps a lot.  An Ill timed low on Provisions could be costly, but Gandalf sometimes can soak up some damage as well.

 

Its a good, decently tough quest.

Played it in a 4 players game.

 

Very poor diversity in the encounter deck, it cycle super fast, location pile up, too muche treachery with surge and oher kill you if you reveal 2 in a single staging (3 with eleanor, but that's easy when all location and half the enemies are out).

Remind me too much of Emyn Muil. Boring enemies and unbeatable in 4 player if you don't have at least 3 player with location management. Also healers, but one is enough early and then you need one or two other.

 

As all Emyn Muil attempts, either you got your location management out, or you die helplessly. Eleanor and Test of Will are mandatory and you can still be crushed in one bad staging. Reminds that the game is not design for 4 players.

You don't need 3 player with location management, you just need one player with 3 Northern Trackers :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Lorien Guide, Ride to Ruin and other stuff would be good though.

 

And there is a spirit guy in the same pack who lets you discard a location from top of the deck.

I used a dwarf deck that handles the scenario better than anything i tried.

I used Nori, Bifur and Dain. I have not used Dain in ages, but was getting tired of fiddling around with this quest with experimental decks and it was time to pull in the big guns.

Pretty simple deck with loads of dwarf allies to keep threat low, which Nori was key for as well as treachery cancelation. Built up classic dwarf army during stage 2, pushed through stage 3 in one go, ready dwarves with lore of Moria and finish boss off for stage 4.

This one gave me quite a bit of trouble before this, it's a bit of a frustrating quest in my opinion. This was the first scenario that I did not really enjoy the Time mechanic and found it a bit annoying, but i guess thats the point of being stuck in a swamp.

Finally had a win against this quest.  I found it to be a lot more punishing than I thought from the first attempt.  Initially tried with some ranger-esque decks for theme, and got close to winning but fell short of enough combat power to fell the Marsh-dweller.  Then I had a series of catastrophic losses, mostly due to attrition via Low on Provisions (deal 1 damage among your characters for each character you control), early and constant combat thanks to Remnants of Elder Days (each player fetches and engages an enemy), or Neekerbreekers assassinating Nalir when there were few allies in play.  Neekerbreekers plus treacheries that remove time counters just suck.  

 

I tried including Eleanor just to combat Low on Provisions for those ally swarm decks, but it was too handicapping to use a hero slot for a hero who ended up not getting used in most rounds.  My attempts at attachment superhero decks failed because I needed too many resources to pull it off, and one of the stage 2 quest card effects prevents you from collecting resources through card effects (or drawing cards through card effects, for that matter, but that was less of an issue).  So those decks heated up too slowly.

 

Eventually won with Gimli-Ori-Bombur and Dain-Glorfindel(Sp)-Nori.  Like Tracker1, I hadn't used Dain, or dwarves at all, in a dog's age.  But after so many fails I needed some raw power to bull through this one.  Pulled it off on my third attempt with those decks.  Low on Provisions was still an awful reveal, but Hardy Leadership offset it and I had Wardens of Healing working full time.

Similar experience here. I was purposefully and stubbornly trying to beat this quest with a thematic ranger deck and got close a couple times, but failed at the last battle. I was holding out to try to get a sweet victory with a fun deck, but finally pulled out an old Dwarf standby and blasted through the quest. For an encore, I pitted the Dwarves against Nightmare Shadow and Flame and was successful!

Interesting to hear others struggled with this one too. This scenario was a surprise for me. Many of the recent scenarios I've been able to be use a diversity of different decks to beat them, but this one I tried lots of different deck themes and fell short for one reason or another. I was surprised I had to build a deck with player cards I had not used in ages to get some comfortable wins.

I had a blast playing this quest and developing a deck to beat it consistently. Here is what I came up with:

 

  http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1266898/questing-through-nin-eilph [http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1266898/questing-through-nin-eilph]

 

Some of the recent cards really show their strengths here, including Idraen and Wingfoot (to have multiple heroes available for questing and fighting) and Greyflood Wanderer (for additional progress). Really, really like the random quest stages and the additional replayability that they provide!

Existance of Horse Breeder combined with lack of any mounts (Aflaoths :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]) confuses me. Do you use her exclusively for blocking/soaking damage?

I've used her before, without mounts.  She's a good cost-to-willpower ratio with a low "activation" fee (I mean, put 1 willpower into play for 1 resource).

There is even more 1cost-to-effectiveness gal, Silvan Refugee, who provides 1 more willpower for the same cost. And this deck seems to be not the kind of that who loses characters constantly.

Silvan Refugee is hard to rely on in this quest.  You have to expect that Neekerbreekers or Low on Provisions might hit you at some point, and you'll lose an ally or allies.  I like Silvan Refugee as much as anyone, but sometimes she is just too darn fragile.

But unless struck with an extremely bad luck, Silvan Refugee will do twice the amount of help.

Have you played this quest?  It's a slim encounter deck.  It's not so much luck as it is inevitability.

Or I was on the other end... not once but twice I got the following scenario within the first two rounds: player has no allies on the table yet, then during staging we get Remnants of Elder Days (fetch an enemy), and get a Neekerbreekers engaged since they seem less threatening than the Giant Swamp Adder.  Next card to be revealed is Shifting Marshland (remove a time counter), which triggers Neekerbreekers and surges into Shifting Marshland and kills the poor little defenseless dwarf.

 

And let's not talk about how many times I drew Low on Provisions, ugh.. the time I won I was lucky and only drew it once.

 

edit: I guess that's the other thing, I never play pure solo, so I probably see these evil combos a lot more often.

I've had the same story solo, things can go wrong quickly even when I felt like I had things under control i've lost on the very next turn.

If i remember i started to read in this post that this quest is easy. Well, i think it is very hard, in 2 players, me and a friend, we tried it a lot of times and finally we won, but after 4 times trying to reach the victory.

Finally got a victory with my Ranger themed deck. It might depend upon the deck you're using, but I do find that if I get the quest stage 2 that forces a random discard to quest, then things go well (as long as you have decent card draw). If I get the no resources/no card draw from card effects one or the limit 1 card played per turn, then things go much worse. So a lot of it seems to depend upon the quest stage(s) you get.

Well, if you can deal with locations, threat and some enemies, there is nothing that prevents you from staying in Quest 2 for a while. After a maximum of 3 turns, you can be sure to get a different Stage 2 due to the time effect. I never had any problem waiting to get to a different stage. But then again, I only played this quest solo so far.

I think the fact that a Ranger deck does not work at all in a swamp scenario us the only thing I dislike about this scenario.

 

(yeah, i also tried and failed)

 

One deck that worked surpisingly well is a Sam-Eleanor secrecy deck. The new event cards combinded with Leaf Brooch are awesome. You can send Samwise with 5 WP  to the quest for 3-4 turns without paying anything - and you don't loose a card! You also get Bill the Pony and Rivendell Scout for free, and Celduin Traveler goes for only one resource. That gives you 4 WP for a total of  only one resource plus enough HP to survive Low on Provisions. Spirit Bilbo is also nice to have, and Galadriel is great when you can grab her with Timely Aid. For Gondor solves the boss fight even with low ATT allies,  Steward of Gondor and Faramir simply do their jobs.

 

Two hints: use Gandalfs ability to draw cards and don't use any allies with only one HP.

Started trying this yesterday, played three attempts, lost all of them. Tried a Celeborn, Haldir Glorfindel deck on first two, but Light of Valinor never came, Asfaloth too, and my threat went dead as time went on with this marsh dweller getting harder and harder. Reached last stage on both of them. Then changed to a Celeborb, Haldir Legolas which could not even get past stage two (on all three games in first stage 2 draw the one you discard cards to quest, which is a disaster). I believe i must leave out my thematic approaches (i always try to make thematic decks) and build a good deck to beat this

Managed to just barely squeak out a win on my first try (with a pair of decks: a conventional Mirlonde / Haldir / Celeborn Silvan deck and a fairly mediocre Frodo / Eowyn / Eomer deck). I never really got any synergies going at all with the player decks (didn't draw any cards to spin up any Silvan tricks and no toys for Eomer), so I basically bum rushed the quest deck to clear out stages 2 and 3 before they ran out of time and then ruthlessly sacrificed all the non combat heroes on the board to 5 attacks from the Ancient Marsh Dweller (4 right at the beginning of Stage 4 due to bad shadow card draws) then used a combination of Sneak Attack Gandalf (for direct damage) and Haldir, Eomer, and Nalir to finish off the boss monster to sloppily finish up the quest.

Agreed! My next two games ended in pretty bad fashion; in the second one in particular I was hit second turn with a two Low on Provisions's which decimated the Silvan deck which had some (otherwise) good draws to start off. I think I am going to try some of the solo decks that are being posted to see how they work out next.
