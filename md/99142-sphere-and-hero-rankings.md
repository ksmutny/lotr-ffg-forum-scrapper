Which is the sphere and the hero you have played more often? In my Quest Log Stadistic of this web today it reads:

 

The most played sphere: Lore (43% !!! O.O)

And the hero: Beravor!!! Wow (8%)

 

 

Do you know which sphere and hero you play more often? Maybe not the percentatges, but yes you know the sphere and the name of the hero..., how about?

It's really hard to say since I stopped using the quest log a long time ago, but if I had to guess...

 

Probably Leadership Aragorn and Leadership as a sphere

## 3 [chrsjxn on February 13, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99142-sphere-and-hero-rankings/?do=findComment&comment=983281)

Yeah, I haven't kept detailed statistics, but I love Secrecy, so...

Sphere: Spirit, Hero: Glorfindel. Second place is probably Leadership and Theodred.

## 4 [chuckles on February 13, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99142-sphere-and-hero-rankings/?do=findComment&comment=983304)

I'm not sure as didn't realise there was a quest log at he beginning... so Aragorn & Leadership would have been really high but according to the log...

 

Sphere: Tactics. Hero: S'Glorfindel... Legolas number two.

## 5 [GrandSpleen on February 13, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99142-sphere-and-hero-rankings/?do=findComment&comment=983315)

That was cool, I never really look at those stats... but I have been logging every quest I've played, win or lose, since about 2 months after I got the game.  For the narrative... it's fun to go back and read what happened in quests of long ago.

 

Lore for me at 39%, which surprised me!  I figured Tactics would be at the top, and it was close... 37%.  But I guess the deck I've been playing recently is spirit/lore, so I do go without old red sometimes.

 

Legolas took the top spot, with Gimli a little bit behind.  I haven't used Gimli in ages, but I guess I used him enough in the old days that he still ranks near the top.  After that, it's a pretty even spread.  Guess I like to experiment.

Cool forum idea.  I don't keep detailed stats or use the quest log (and I play two handed so...)but it's probably:

Sphere: Tactics
Hero: Boromir/Legolas. 
Hard to pick between the two.  I love Boromir the character and his abilities are thematic, so I use him a lot.  Legolas is just so good, it's hard not to use him.

Sphere: Spirit
Hero: Eowyn
She's so good at what she does, she gets better with more players in a game, and she helps my aggressive approach to the game.

I've been taking mono-Spirit Eowyn-Glorfindel-Caldara and mono-Tactics Boromir-Beregond-Legolas decks through the Nightmare scenarios and having a blast.

## 7 [Fippin on February 13, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99142-sphere-and-hero-rankings/?do=findComment&comment=983364)

Mine is definitely Spirit sphere with Eówyn as my number one hero (14%)

I love Eówyn for questing and Spirit for treachery/shadow cancelation, bringing cards back from discard piles and Unexpected Courage.

## 8 [Karlson on February 13, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99142-sphere-and-hero-rankings/?do=findComment&comment=983368)

I always play two-handed solo and almost always have dual sphere decks in both hands; so, I use each sphere fairly consistently, but if I had to favor one it would probably be Lore or Tactics.  

 

I've been trying to use Spirit Glorfindel and Frodo less, but Mr. Baggins' ability is so great and Glorfindel, well no words are necessary for that beast.  I use Lore Aragorn, Beregond, and Legolas quite often as well.  It's going to be refreshing to pull out some older Rohan-themed player cards and heroes in the next week or two as I venture to Isengard, though!

## 9 [booored on February 13, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99142-sphere-and-hero-rankings/?do=findComment&comment=983453)

I am a big solo player and find Pipin (Lore) to be my goto card a lot more than bilbo used to. It has been hard adjusting to the lower card draw with out bilbo but that extra point of will and -3 threat really counts.

 

Other than that my fav hero is still Dunhere. . The ability to attack into the staging area is just all win and is so unique still. Even with the great bow it is still such a great ability. No matter the state of this game I expect new versions of a Dunhere deck to keep popping up again and again.

 

So solo I mainly play Lore / Spirit and use tactic splashes with songs and stuff. Though it is getting harder and harder to run rainbow decks.

Well, according to my quest log -though not very accurate since a lot of games are double with my wife who uses a lot of spirit- my most used are Glorfindel (which is true) and spirit (which is cause of my wife i guess). Then comes Legolas and Tactics (these are from my part) but Lore is close too

## 11 [MyNeighbourTrololo on February 13, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99142-sphere-and-hero-rankings/?do=findComment&comment=983538)

Never used quest log, but I can tell for sure that my most used hero is Eowyn. 

## 12 [sparrowpisuke on February 13, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99142-sphere-and-hero-rankings/?do=findComment&comment=983572)

All the spheres an heros the same percentages  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

I don't repeat with a hero (or as much repeat once) until i've played with all the other heros at least once...

I agree. I love Dunhere. He was the champion in my Conflict at the Carrock win! I will look for more ways to include him in decks in the future. I do need to find ways to boost his attack to overcome the high defense of most newer enemies (I almost feel like they make Defense 3 to make Dunhere ineffective. Or am I just paranoid?)

Put in 2 of each for 4 cards == good draw %.. can even go 6 if you want... with 2 he hits for 7 into the staging area. Very strong and the backbone of the current Dunhere deck. I have been fiddling with adding this recently as well but it has to many parts for real consistency, still when it goes off it is crazy.. as in Gimli crazy.. just way more attack than you reasonably need.

I have been able to one shot Mumak with this!

Thanks! My (self-created) problem is that I've only been adding cards as I get to the expansions. So, right now I am about to attempt Journey to Rhosgabel, but the Spear of the Mark is not until Morgul Vale. Perhaps I'm being stupid, but as a newbie I wanted to experience the game as it evolved.

## 16 [booored on February 13, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99142-sphere-and-hero-rankings/?do=findComment&comment=983604)

yeah your right...  that is stupid.

 

Dunhere doesn't make much of a splash after Carrock until Khaz... seams he makes a comback once a cycle so far :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

I think for me that's part of the fun - seeing which heroes/combos are given new life with each expansion. But that spear does look pretty sweet for a Spirit player like me!

## 18 [booored on February 13, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99142-sphere-and-hero-rankings/?do=findComment&comment=983613)

well the dagger give the exact same effect but it is not limited to the Rohan trait. \

 

The funny thing is I can not think of a rohan ally card that can attack into the staging area... note the spear says "character" not "hero"... so Dunhere may be getting some help soon?

 

At the moment this only makes sense with that trap, ranger spikes. I have been trying to make a solo trap deck with this in mind, but the trap deck takes so many card slots it doesn't work well in solo yet.. so far. Still Horse Back Archer, traps, dunhere, spear and daggers seams that it could be the base of a interesting deck... but not yet. Elfhelm is the only other 2attk rohan charicter

My favorite sphere is leadership and my most send-to-battle-hero is Dain, though he mostly did not much but staying ready. Really love dwarfes

Mumak can't take more than 3 damage per round. Are you sure, you did this correctly?

## 20 [booored on February 13, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99142-sphere-and-hero-rankings/?do=findComment&comment=983623)

yeah, he didn't die, meant to say "could have"..  I hit him for over 19 dmg. 7 in spears + 12 resources (from a pool of 13).

 

The trick is to have Dunhere but only use spirit resources for threat reduction... and nothing else so they stack up. Get a UC on him and Blood of Numenor for questing as well. Then as you attack and quest steward keeps the resource count stable. Anytime there is no one to attack questing and attack gose up by one a turn. Resourceful fuels the other heros who share a sphere.

yeah, it would be wasted at the moment... but there are a couple of ways to get allies attacking in the staging area:

M1842.png [http://hallofbeorn.com/Images/Cards/M1842.png]

 

 

or

 

M1030.png [http://hallofbeorn.com/Images/Cards/M1030.png] plus M1493.png [http://hallofbeorn.com/Images/Cards/M1493.png]

 

You could also wait until after an enemy has attacked, then declare your own attack, THEN play A Light in the Dark to move it back to the staging area.... but that'd just be silly.

I've never kept detailed stats on this, but my gut feeling would be that Lore would get most used sphere. Individual hero is, without doubt, Legolas. Although these new hobbits are starting to creep in all over the place. Tried to build a Rohan and Gondor combo decks, and ended up putting in 2 hobbits to smooth things out, because they're so good! **** you Sam!!

## 23 [Mndela on February 13, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99142-sphere-and-hero-rankings/?do=findComment&comment=983929)

My second heroe is Elrond. My log page display it, between 7 and 8 %.

 

Yes, one of the most played decks are: outlanders and vilya, both decks has Elrond as a hero.

## 24 [Noccus on February 13, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99142-sphere-and-hero-rankings/?do=findComment&comment=984180)

Favorite, and most played sphere: lore, by far.

2nd mostly played is spirit. Though I don't like the sphere that much as I almost always use the same cards.

3rd is tactics. And I'm warming up more and more to it.

4th, leadership doesn't do much for me. I've seen enough SoG & sneak attack, thx.

Heroes: (I play multiplayer)

Lore: Bifur. Followed closely by Aragorn & Elrond.

Spirit: Glorfindel. (Tho Eleanor really proves her worth time and again with several players)

Tactics: Legolas. Hands down. No contest.

Leadership: gloin I guess...

## 25 [Mndela on February 28, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99142-sphere-and-hero-rankings/?do=findComment&comment=998698)

I have keep only the games with higscore, from 1 to 4 players, in all scenarios; and the result is:

 

Bifur 9,09%

Beravor 6,82%

Elrond 6,59%

Ori 5,23%

Mirlonde 5,23%

....

and etc.

 

Only comment: all lore heroes! and the most played...the little Bifur! Wow...

Just started this game solo a couple months ago and I am only on The Dead Marshes (playing chronologically).

My sphere weight is...

Lore 66.67%

Leadership 33.33%

My hero weight is

Denethor 33.33%

Aragorn(core) 18.52%

Glorfindel 18.52%

Gloin(core) 14.81%

Beravor 14.81%

My main hero setup is Aragorn, Denethor, and Glorfindel, but when I need to start with a lower threat level I use Beravor, Denethor, Gloin.

According to the Quest Log Lore is my number 1 sphere and Beravor is my top hero with Bifur(!?) as #2.

 

I definitely agree with Lore but I think the hero stats are mostly historical because I haven't been logging my scores as much in the past few months.

 

I think Legolas is probably my favorite hero and I'm really looking forward to a new version of him sometime in the future.
