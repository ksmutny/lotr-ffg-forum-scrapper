FFG released a card art that they say will show up in Flame of the West (and they confirm it will be out in Gencon).The added the message "Be refined- the kind of hero we all want to be." And it looks a lot like Beregond to me, right after abandoning his post and killing the guards to save Faramir. Spirit or even Leadership Beregond hero would be my guess!

Why "Be refined"?  I feel there's a hint there.  Maybe this is for an attachment or event?  "Show your Quality"?  Just musing.
