While surfing through the net I stumbled about three pics of early demo cards of Aragorn, Dunhere and Theodred. The design is different in some details, and Aragorn's abilty has been nerfed quite a bit. Not sure if y'all know about these, just in case you don't I will link them here.

 

Go on this German site :

Didn't seen that Theodred and Dunhere yet. Funny.

Ha funny cards. imo these would have been quite better then the ones we got. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] Also the statline has been altered. Willpower at the bottem, while it is now at the top. Theodred would have been a great hero against the Dunland scenarios! Having an ability the control your handsize is great. Also that treachery card that stays in your hand, I think that could be discarded. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

You mean Theodred? Because Dunhere hasn't changed at all, except for now he gets +1 attack while striking the staging area.

Well, that version of Dunhere could arguably have been joined by others. (He initiates the attack, and then gets assistance on his valid target) but he does lose +1 attack.

 

I think the Theodred is definitely worse, he's better at questing sure - but having to discard a card for the resource is a lot worse than getting it free for questing.

Well, that thing about Theodred is arguable at best. First of all, his WP is still 1 so I can't see how he is better at questing. Second, his ability is limited to 1 per phase. Paired with, say, Bilbo and Beravor, he could produce helluva resources on the first turn, setting up a perfect second turn in a multiplayer game. Well, technically, he could do the same even without them, it's just without them his player would have nothing to play for himself :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Appears that traits such as Rohan and Dunedain were icons on the lower right corner of the card. Thanks for the post, I hadn't seen any of these.

There are more demo cards in the image section of LOTR LCG in BGG. It appears Celeborn was meant to be a Spirit hero, and the art on Snouburn Scout and Valiant Sacrifice was different.

Those look awesome! They massively should have kept that!

Indeed, that looks really cool! But it was not Rohan and Dunedain but Rohan amd Gondor in this.example. The White Tree and Aragorn has still a noted Dunedain on his card. But still, that looks freaking awesome!
