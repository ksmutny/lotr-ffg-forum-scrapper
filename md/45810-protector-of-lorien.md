Can you trigger this multiple times ie can I discard 3 cards to give the hero +3 willpower or +3 attack?  I am only asking because it doesnt say once per turn

It doesnt say once per turn, so yes you can.

A lot of people think this card is broken and should have the wording "once per round", but currently it doesnt, so use it whilst you can.

This is a good point, that may tame it's usefulness.

You do have to keep an eye on how many cards you have left in you deck to avoid it's overuse, still when you are playing with 50+ card decks, the chance of running out of cards due to over use of PoL is small, I guess.

The card is very powerful, but the Lore deck is pretty limited in questing options without out, at the moment.
