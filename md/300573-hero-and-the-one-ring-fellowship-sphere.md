Hi guys,

The rules indicate that we have to use a heroe and the one ring from the fellowship sphere when we play saga scenarios in campaign mode but what happen if the scenario is not played in that mode, do we still need to use a hero and the one ring from the fellowship sphere?

Regards

Yes you still use the hero and one ring included for even non campaign playthroughs. There are encounter cards that interact with the ring-bearer and one ring.
