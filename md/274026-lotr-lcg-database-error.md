I don't see anywhere on his site to contact him, but I'm getting an error when I attempt to visit page 4 when sort by "Hero" cards and just typing enter. (I'm new to the game and curious which Heroes come where so I can focus on getting characters I like.)

I'm assuming people are familiar with this site, unless there's a better/more popular one? Any chance the owner is on here or anyone can contact him?

I don't know this site. I'm more familiar with http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR] who get an exhaustive database also used in the deckbuilder ringsbd.com

That works, too. I ran into a couple error pages on the other site, it was just the first google result and seemed competent otherwise.

Yeah, use a different one (use Beorn. Also, you can use RingsDB to look up cards).

The lotrlcg one has been abandoned, no updates for several years.

It only have cards up to the third cycle. Since we have finished the 7th it miss a lot of cards ^^

RingsDB is very good for deckbuilding, but Hall of Beorn has a catalog of encounter cards in addition to player cards.
