# [Beating Under The Ash Mountains](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/308032-beating-under-the-ash-mountains/)

## 1 [asgardianphil on April 28, 2020](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/308032-beating-under-the-ash-mountains/?do=findComment&comment=3931961)

My pack came today. 👏

I've had a quick look at the quest and a friend sent me a screen shot of someone frustrated with the shennenigens in this quest. Looks like the player deck is your  dwindling resources/supplies. The encounter deck is going to make you discard cards like crazy. The quest cards do this based on side quests in play. I haven't looked at any other encounter cards yet. 

I'm guessing a dwarven deck that triggers off discarding cards would work well here, but not the dwarven tropes that actually do the discarding. 

Discard pile cards would shine such as Spirit ally Glorfindel. Stand and fight, reforged, Caldara Galadhrim Weaver, knight of Belfalas, Elven-light, Will of the West. Dwarven Tomb. (A lot of Spirit cards) 

Cards that reorder the top of the deck. Might be useful to make sure you only draw what's essential. Cards that search and pull. So many cards across all spheres. 

And of course side quest loving cards like East Road Ranger, Thallion, legacy blade etc. 

So, I think I might build a Spirit Dwarven Deck. 

Before I dive in what are your thoughts about this quest?

Dwarven Pipe will be super useful in this quest and also Ever My Heart Rises would probably shine.

Dwarves seems indeed the way, but not the mining ones. Might be time to take off some dust from your old Leadership Dain Ironfoot swarm decks.

Lucky you, I doubt I will see mine before this summer.

Side quests are going to need to be cleared quickly if they crop up too. Spirit sphere has Rider of Rohan to help once a side quest is cleared. 

Also just noticed both stages of the quest ban Will of The West. 'Event cards cannot shuffle cards from a players discard pile' 

Very carefully worded so as not to prevent card fetching from the discard pile by other means. 

 

I feel very lucky getting this pack. I thought it would be weeks. 

I ordered my pack from boargameextras 24th April.

Also, a friend of mine got his pack from Games Lore as part of his subscription last week which prompted me to search and buy.

I got mine delivered from gameslore a few days ago,  but I haven't gotten around to trying it yet.

Game over.

Well,  it was a rubbish deck and I was going to use it and another deck to punish myself against nightmare Escape from Dol Guldur just for fun. But then this pack turned up. 

This was a fun quest and there is a lot to build a deck against.

Side quests

Underground

Low cost cards

Questing

Discarding and Discard pile manipulation

High WP.

The encounter deck locks out direct progress on locations by having an explore effect rather than a travel effect. Hates will of the west and has high HP enemies that use # of quests I play and discard cards. 

Definitely needs strong questing to quickly get the side quests into the victory pile.

## 7 [asgardianphil on May 9, 2020](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/308032-beating-under-the-ash-mountains/?do=findComment&comment=3936908)

Game #3. 

I've tweaked my Kahliel deck a little bit.  (Deck building is not something I'm very good at, but this is my deck rather than one from online.) 

 

Heroes are Kahliel, Elrond and Glorfindel. Threat 28. 50 card deck. 

Draws: Dwarf Pipe,  Elrond's Council, Galadriel, Warden of Healing, Ered Luin Miner, Hidden Cache. 

As much as I want the Warden I don't want the cache or the miner so I'm going to mulligan.

Mulligan: Steward of Gondor, Dwarf Pipe, Hidden Cache, The Elven King, Reforged and Light of Valinor. 

 

At this point I now realise in my first two games I have been discarding too many cards. Set up says if your deck has more than 40 cards discard down to 40. I was taking the amount of cards I had before drawing my starting hand. So where before I'd of discarded 10+ cards I only need to discard 4. 

Setup. Discard cards so that you only have 40 cards in your deck:

Stand And Fight 

Yazan 

A Burning Brand 

Ered Luin Miner ( is put into play.)

Add Torech Gorgor Patrol to staging

A Haunt For Beasts side  quest is added to staging.

Draws Haradrim Spear.

Planning: play Light of Valinor on Glorfindel.

Engagement: engage the Torech Gorgor Patrol.

Combat: Elrond defends the patrol for 3 def. (Shadow is Ransacked Supplies. Discards Light of Valinor from play.) 2 damage on Elrond. 

Things are looking grim already. Perhaps I shouldn't have engaged. However, I thought I needed to in order to clear the side quest quickly before more enemies appear. 

Refresh: TD 30 discards Stand And Fight from under TD. 

Discards 4 cards due to # of quests. Ancestral Armour, Silver Circlet, Kahliel's Tribesman and Firyal. 

 

Turn 2 

Draws Jubayr. 

Planning: play Reforged to play Light of Valinor from the discard pile.

Play Steward of Gondor on Kahliel and exhaust it to add 2 resources. 

Play Haradrim Spear on Kahliel.

Commit Glorfindel and Elrond to the quest. For 6 WP.

Commit Glorfindel, Elrond and Kahliel for 8 WP. 

Stages The Tunnels of Torech Gorgor side quest. (This is really, really bad.) 

5 threat Vs 8 WP. 3 progress made on A Haunt for Beasts. Clears it to the  Victory Display. 

Travel: forced to travel to Firey Chasm. 

Combat: poor Bilbo defends the Patrol for 0 def. (Shadow is Namless Beast. Gains +0 attack [Hidden Cache]. Bilbo is defeated. 

Refresh: TD 32 and discards Dwarf Pipe from under it. Quest forces 4 cards to be discarded: O Lórien!, Southron Refugee, Kahliel's Headdress and Kahliel's Headdress again. 

 

Turn 4

Draws Ered Luin Miner. 

Planning: exhaust Steward of Gondor. 

Play Galadriel using Kahliel's resource. Searches top 5 cards and puts Asfaloth into play on Glorfindel. Reorders Hidden Cache, Southron Refugee, Elf Friend and Galadriel top to bottom.

Turn 5

Draws Kahliel's Tribesman. 

Planning: exhaust Steward of Gondor.

Quest: choose Lost In The Dark as the current quest. 

commit Glorfindel, Elrond and Kahliel to the quest for 8 WP. 

Stages Burning Reek. doomed 1. TD 34 and discards Light Of Valinor from under it. Also have to discard 6 cards due to having 6 characters in play. Only have 5 cards remaining so this is game over.

 

Really bad first turn. I think if I hadn't engaged the Patrol it would still have been really difficult to win due to the side quests comming out.

Oops I forgot to post that, I noticed you were discarding too many cards but forgot to mention that... Sorry. Yeah since you drew 6 cards you only discard 4 (assuming your deck is the standard 50 card size).

## 9 [asgardianphil on May 9, 2020](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/308032-beating-under-the-ash-mountains/?do=findComment&comment=3936970)

Game #4. 

A double bill today. 

Just threw this deck together. It's a dwarf deck and has 56 cards in it. It's probably trying to cram too much into it. But there is so much it needs to do in this quest that it's a struggle to think on what to focus on. 

Still, most people probably play a deck and then need to tweak. So here goes my pre tweak attempt. 

Heroes are (Leadership) Dain Ironfoot, (Spirit) Nori and (Leadership) Thorin Oakenshield. Threat Dial 32. 

Draw starting hand. Durin's Song, Galadriel, Elf-Friend, Erebor Hammersmith, Durin's Song and Bofur. This hand has no set up cards so I'll mulligan

Mulligan: Gandalf (core), Ered Luin Miner, Dwarven Shield, Untroubled by Darkness, O Lórien! And Bofur. 

Not much better. 

Setup: 50 cards left so I need to discard 10.

Narvi's Belt 

Dwarven Sellsword

Hardy Leadership 

Galadhrim Weaver 

Erebor Record Keeper 

Reforged

Play Bofur from hand (which doesn't trigger the side quest's forced effect. 

Threat 3 Vs 10 WP. 7 progress made o  the current quest moving it to the Victory Display. Top 3 discarded cards are shuffled back into the player deck. Bofur returns to my hand.

I think what makes this quest so hard is the '1 more than X' text on numerous cards. I think it should just have been X as there is always a main quest in play so X would always be 1. 

I feel that the Galadhrim Weaver is the only way to rescue cards from the discard pile. And the only way to reccur her without discarding a card is with The Elvenking. And that means either playing a Silvan Hero or having Elf-Friend. All that takes a lot of set up. So you need to pull those attachments or get them back with Reforged, Stand and Fight and Erebor Hammersmith etc. 

 

Does anybody else have an idea on how to use the card discarding mechanics to an advantage or at least prolong your life in the quest?

Hidden Cache and Ered Luin Miner are one way. Another is a Noldor deck which wants some copies of other cards in the discard pile already (Elwing's Flight, Lords of the Eldar and so forth). Whenever the quest will be up on OCTG I will try it a few times.

Yep, I had 3 off the Dwarven Pipes. They are really good, but you need a shuffler too otherwise the cards you save sit on the  bottom. So the Galadhrim Weaver helps with that. 

 

I've made a few tweaks and exchanged Nori for spirit  Legolas so that I don't need Elf-Friend or O Lórien! Although I've left in that so that she becomes free to play. 

More importantly I've got the deck down to 50 cards. 

I guess if I use the one ring and a master card I could get the discard down to just two cards.

So what have I learned..

The enemies are Gandalf proof. (None can be killed by him except the Spawn of Shelob which is a waste for Gandalf, so yeah he's Gandalf proof too.

The starting enemy Torech  Gorgor Patrol shuts down uber questing. He maximises your progress to 5 on the main quest. But you need to make 50 progress over the 2 stages. 

The side quests are brutal adding to staging threat. One can't be quested unless you've explored 3 locations. One cant be quested whilst enemies are staged. One punishes you for each card played and one grabs 10 cards off you. 

Locations want you to come with direct progress effects. They all trigger on being explored rather than travel effects. 

Any strategy you try to build is broken by the constant discarding or imprisoning of cards.

The game is over if you run out of cards and you only start with 40. Draw 1 card each turn and discard on average 3 a turn. Means you have to do this quest in 10 turns or find ways to get cards back. 

Having high costing cards in your deck or discard pile can ruin your day from a couple of encounter cards. 

Locks out Will of the West

Direct damage will kill your 1 HP questers. 

Shadow effects cause additional attacks. 

Swarming of characters is checked with a nasty treachery.

All characters' game text can be cancelled by  treachery. 

Attachment discarding effects. 

All in all a very difficult and nasty quest. The synergy between staging effects and Shadow effects is tight. There's no card you want to see come up. Nothing really whiffs. It all combos nicely together.

What you need to do to win is basically engage and/or kill the Torech Gorgor Patrol and quest hard ignoring everything else. 

But the encounter deck won't let you get off so easily.

Which is also TaEowyn-proof since it requires a total of 13 Attack and since it makes at least two attacks (one on engagement and one on the combat phase) can't be just Feinted away.

Also how lovely that basically almost all the enemies have just over 4 (or 8 in case of the Patrol) Hit Points so that if Haunt of Beasts is in play you have to deal with them for at least 1 extra turn.

🤭🤭🤭

This is so true..

But I fear secrecy won't cut it either. 

I think frustration is part of the game, in fact any game. I'd be lying if I hadn't felt frustrated at being killed in a computer game (the Dark Zone in the Division is particularly frustrating when a clan swoop down on you and steal your stuff and slaughter you.)

I reckon if you feel frustrated at this game then the game makers will be chuckling to themselves and congratulating themselves on creating a particularly challenging scenario. 

On the one hand it forces you to think out of the box but on the other hand it makes you reach for the must have staples and the big powerful guns that you can't win without. 

I wonder if this quest could be beaten with the contract it came with?

Back to the drawing board... maybe I'll try a Rohan questing deck..

Game #6

I thought about hitting the enemies in staging so I found a Fastred/Dunhere deck that does it. I made a few tweaks but it has none of the discard manipulation I had in before, so no stand and fight/reforged or Galadhrim Weaver shenanigans. 

In fact the deck also has no healing or resource acceleration which I'm a little worried about. 

So here goes nothing...

Heroes Fastred, Dunhere and (tactics) Éowyn. Threat Dial 26

50 card deck.

Draw hand: Elrond's Council, A Test of Will, Open The Armoury, Galadriel's Handmaiden, Dagger of Westernesse and Strength And Courage. 

I'll mulligan as I don't want the master card. 

Mulligan: Arwen Undómiel, Pippin, Golden Belt, Galadriel's Handmaiden, Knights of The Swan and Ancient Mathom. 

Setup: reduce threat by 3 TD 26.

Search for The One Ring and put it on Dunhere.

Search for a master card. Finds Strength and Courage and adds to hand.

Discard 2 cards: Captain Of Gondor and Silvan Refugee. 

Add Torech Gorgor Patrol to staging. 

Add Lost in the Dark to staging and it puts 10 cards under threat dial. 

 

Turn 1

Draws Dagger of Westernesse. 

Planning: play Golden Belt and Dagger of Westernesse on Dunhere. 

Play Arwen Undómiel. 

Quest: choose Lost in the Dark as current Quest. 

Commit Éowyn and Arwen for 6 WP. +1 def to Fastred. 

Stages Firey Chasm. 

6 threat vs 6 WP. No progress. 

Travel: to Firey Chasm. 

Combat: Dunhere attacks Torech Gorgor Patrol in staging for 5 att. Deals 1 damage. 

Refresh: TD 24 and discards Dagger of Westernesse from under dial. 

Discard 3 cards: Open the Armory, Ethir Swordsman and Arwen Undómiel. 

 

Turn 2

Draws Spear of The Mark.

Planning: play Spear of The Mark on Dunhere. (Now has 3 restricted attachments)

Hey the deck u used in game 5 was good. I have a suggestion. Add 3 copies of hunting party. Thats lets you discard an enemy in staging for something else.

I was thinking if perhaps a Caldara heavy willpower deck might be a good choice for this quest, make use of the starting discard to seed good allies to take back. Possibly a SpEowyn/Arwen/Caldara lineup to hopefully play Prince Imrahil in the first turn to get back some good allies. You could maybe start with more than 60 cards to raise the chance of discarding something useful like Glorfindel/Jubayr/Elfhelm/Northern Tracker in the quest setup.

EDIT: possibly something like this

I don't see how this deck is gonna handle enemies. Its got great willpower but other than ride them down, not to many ways to deal with big enemies, like the patrol who prevents more than 5 progress. If the wild beasts sidequest comes out I think your deck would be doomed...

It stil has quite a bit of decent combat allies (Elfhelm, the Trackers, Glorfindel, Rider of Rohan) and Eowyn with Herugrim is attacking for 5+ so not too shabby either. For defense we have Jubayr, Against the Shadow, the Watchmen or a "sneak attack" ally with Stand and Fight. It might have some problems handling big enemies, you are right, I won't know for sure until I playtest it a bit.

The main idea was to try and take advantage of all those discard, especially the Setup ones, and Caldara seemed a good fit for that.

Another idea might be to use Saruman or Revelead in Wrath to get rid of the Patrol restriction on progress without actually having to engage it.

Caldara is certainly an interesting option with pulling allies out of the discard. She would probably be best with a tactical deck across the table.

And deck that can fit hunting party in should probably do it for this quest. Discarding the patrol is incredibly powerful

I did toy around with the idea of putting in a load of cards to get a good portion of them into the discard pile. So maybe 70 cards of which 26 would be discarded hopefully putting in there a load of stuff I could work with.

It might dilute the deck so that there's less chance of something important being discarded. But you're more likely to loose all 3 copies of an important card you can't get back. After erroneously discarding too many cards in my first few games I realised that any amount of cards discarded was bad  news. 

So what cards are going to work in this deck? (Not necessarily together)

♤ Discard Pile shennenigens:

Anborn 

Anchor Watch 

Beorning Skin Changer

Book of Eldacar

Caldera

Dwarf Pipe

Before the Dunhere deck I was seriously considering a Haldir deck. Mono lore. Great Hunt would work and also put off Pursuit; providing you got a location.

The plan would also be to Get The One Ring and  Strength and Courage on Haldir giving him an attack 7 before any other weapon buffs but that would require a Tactics icon so Rivendell Minstrels and Songs of Battle to combo. Then he could also get a Rivendell Blade for more impact. Golden belt and Dagger of Westernesse thrown in too. 

I think I'll build that deck next

Chuck in Galadhrim Minstrels and East Road Rangers and the Scroll of Isuldur too I think.

Thats a great option too, if you can manage to play mono lore.

Asgardianphil played a deck with Sp legolas and Thorin and had the necessary traits to play hunting party from the start. Seems like a perfect addition for this quest patrol and trolls)

This might be too much janky but how about Revealed in Wrath + Hirgon + Knight of Minas Tirith to take care of the Patrol? It will have 0 Threat and won't limit the progress and you would also avoid the engagement forced attack.

That's a really good combo but the Patrol has def 4 so knight of Minas Tirith would not damage it. However I guess you're just trying to get it out of staging at this point to avoid its threat hike and 2 attacks. 

From there Forest Snare it or make sure you cancel its  shadow effect as there are some that return enemies to staging.

I think Revealed In Wrath is not a bad shout in general as Namless Beast can really sting if you aren't using cards to track the top card of your deck, or even if you are and you know it's a high one like what happened to me. I revealed Gandalf adding +5 for an 8vatt + shadow effect. Cave Troll really hurts too as you cant chump block him. Revealed in Wrath will let you.

Turn 4

2 threat vs 6 WP. 4 progress made on side quest clearing it and put 1 progress on Mirkwood Explorer. Shuffles back top 3 cards.

Going to lose a Hero now. And both copies of the Houses of Healing and Scroll of Isuldur are deep in the discard pile I'm scooping.

Game over

 

Well this time the deck pulled everything out that would stop this deck dead in it's tracks. No locations, 2 side quests and the only 2 enemies that would cause it a problem. 

The deck is like a glass house though no defense. However the idea was not to engage anything and destroy it in the staging. 

I think I'll give it another go though.

Cheers

I was 98% sure that it had no effect, but then I've been playing in my own bubble and may have got it wrong. I mainly play this solo. 

It's really good for me to write out my moves for all to scrutinise so that any mistakes I've been making get picked up. 

During this loss I had the feeling that no strategy is safe.. the discard effect tore threw my deck at unbelievable speed. All my combos were disappearing before my eyes. 

If you have a strategy you have got to get it going within the first couple of turns.

Game #8

More tweaks. Thurindir has been switched for Treebeard for his defense. East Road Ranger has been switched for WellingHall Preserver. As I now have a higher threat i need to not engage enemies so i put in Ranger Spikes and Anbon (taking out Gildor who is too costly at 5).

Turn 6

Draws The Great Hunt.  And realise I played the Great Hunt in the wrong phase during turn 4. Meaning the troll would have engaged me. 

Scoop due to a mistake but to be honest I was going to loose this anyway. With 50 progress yet to make and at least 1 more guaranteed side quest I can't last with only 9 cards left. 😳 

Back to the design board. I'm thinking I now need to prevent these locations from hurting the board state so that I can get the side quests even quicker. It's taking all game just to clear 1.

I just beat it twice with this deck: https://ringsdb.com/deck/view/169183 [https://ringsdb.com/deck/view/169183]

Originally, I was thinking Tactics Theoden + Tactics Eowyn to kill the Torech Gorgor Patrol on the first turn (with Inner Strength on Beregond, you can defend with impunity, and so all you need is a Feint or a chump blocker for the second attack). But I couldn't muster enough willpower to blow through the quest fast enough, so I decided to go for Spirit Eowyn for the sphere balance. I took inspiration from a Seastan deck with the same hero lineup, because it can get Tactics Theoden up to 6 attack on the first turn with Herugrim, which can be very valuable, and just added a few more questing allies and some stuff to interact with the discard mechanic of the quest.

I left it at 56 cards in hopes of seeding the discard pile with good cards for Stand and Fight or Reforged (or getting Hidden Cache/Ered Luin Miner into play) before the game even started, but you could pretty easily cut it down to 50 (I'd probably cut Open the Armory - it's normally an essential card for this kind of deck, but card draw can be a liability in this quest - and Hidden Cache - the extra resources are useful for getting set up but become pointless in the late game).

It's not a guaranteed win, to be sure. I lost once on the last turn of the game. Questing for 19 against 0 threat in staging, and only needed to make progress. Then Burning Reek came out and I only had 6 cards left in the deck but 13 characters out. I lost a couple other times, less memorably - this quest is unforgiving. But this deck can do it. The first time I won, I got out 2 Ered Luin Miners and a Hidden Cache in the opening discard (8 cards), and I had 2 Ethir Swordsmen in the opening hand. That 4 willpower let me clear the opening side quest (can't remember what it was), and it was pretty smooth sailing after that. The second quest was much harder-fought. At one point, I ended up with all 3 Patrols out and I couldn't find Herugrim, Veteran Axehands, or Stand and Fight to pull the ones out of my discard pile. I didn't discard an Ered Luin Miner until the late game, and I ended up playing 2 from my hand just to play the Dwarf Pipes on them. But I consistently handled willpower, and I eventually whittled down the Patrols. (I finally did find Herugrim with an Open the Armory). The win took 14 rounds, and I only had 5 cards left, so Burning Reek or Lost in the Dark would have sunk me if it came out.

The priority of the deck is getting out willpower - I mulliganned for Ethir Swordsmen or Galadriel's Handmaidens. Both wins, I had 2 or more willpower allies in hand on turn 1. Second priority is readying on Beregond - that's the guaranteed way to engage a patrol, and you can afford to let it sit there for a while, even if you get a second enemy. Third priority is Herugrim on Theoden or - failing that - Veteran Axehands/Ered Luin Miners. On multiple occasions, I actually left the Ethir Swordsmen ready so they could contribute their attack to kill a patrol. Reforged gets you Dwarf Pipes out of the discard pile, Stand and Fight gets you whatever you need. I always quest with Theoden turn 1 (and often 2 and 3 as well) because I found clearing the side quests to be the most important thing.

I think there might be a variant of this that uses a 3-attack Spirit hero (Lanwyn or Idraen) and Tactics Eowyn to kill the Patrol turn 1 and still have the willpower mustering you need. Perhaps it uses Eowyn + herugrim as a primary attacker?

The beacons are lit... 

Beregond calls for aid

... And Rohan shall answer!

 

Thanks for sharing your deck and victories.

I'll give it a go, although I might not get to play it  now until Thursday. Wednesday night is my boadgaming group night but due to lock down we still all meet up every Wednesday; but on the Division 2 to play and chat. 

I'm excited for this. I thought a Rohan deck would be the way to go. 

And those 4 retrieval staples: miner, cache, reforged and Stands with Fists... err stand and fight they are the key to mitigating the damage of the unending discarding effect of the quest. 

Bravo sir! Bravo!

Just found out that my wins are tainted. Apparently, the new Setup rulings mean that you do the Ash Mountain's discard from your deck effect before your resolve player setup cards. Which means that the One Ring and it's Mastery card could potentially get discarded before the ring comes into play.

Which is a ruling that I'm not a fan of, but apparently it exists. So there's no way to reduce the number of cards you discard from your deck by using player setup effects (unless Caleb revisits the ruling in the future and reverses it).

56 card deck.

Draw: Westfold Horse-Breeder, Feint, Galadriel's Handmaiden, Gondorian Shield, Eithir Swordsman and The One Ring.

The ring aside, this is a really good starting hand. Ok soni don't have Herugrim yet but I have the Ring and it can't now be discarded. I have a way to get Snowmane. I have combat cancelation and questers. 

Set up: 

Discard 10 cards:

Honour Guard

Ethir Swordsman

Veteran Axehand

Snowmane

5 Threat vs 11 WP.  6 progress made on side quest. Ready Theoden. 

Engagement: Spawn of Shelob engages. (Was hoping to engage and feint the Patrol this turn but spiders and shadows say otherwise). I'll accept the +2 attack. 

Beregond defends the spider for 7 def. (Shadow is Fiery Chasm. No effect.) No damage. 

Theoden attacks and defeats the spider. 

Refresh: TD 33 and discards Ered Luin Miner. (Alas, as it is not off the too of my deck it stays discarded.)

Phew did it... but how evil is this quest. 

Ready Theoden. 

Travel: to  Twisted Tunnel.

Ered Luin Miner defends the Patrol for 1 def. (Shadow is Namless Beast. (Galadhrim Weaver is top of the discard pile. +1 att)). Miner is defeated. 

Ash Mountain Werewolf engages. 

Combat: play Feint on the Werewolf (to save a card from being discarded) good job as it's shadow was going to discard an attachment.

Theoden uses Herugrim and attacks the Werewolf for 4 damage. 

Refresh: TD 32

4 threat vs 9 WP. Makes 5 progress on stage 1. (Total 16. I've got no chance of winning this now) ready Theoden.

Good deck though.

Game 11

 

I've put a questing deck together with 3 of e very card I need. I've deliberately gone way over in order to get Viligant Dunedain intobthe discard pile.

Travel: forced to travel to Twisted Tunnel. 

Engagement: Ash Mountain Werewolf and Namless Beast engages.

I really needed to engage the Patrol this round in order to race through the quest uninhibited in 2 turns but I've got too many enemies now. I really need the Vigilant Dúnadan. 

I think making this deck 60 cards was a mistake. Most of my cards I needed were discarded. 

I'll trim it down and try again. 

Scooped.

Stages Mordor Cave Troll. (Wow. Lowered threat just in time) 

6 threat vs 15 WP. 9 progress made.  Limited to 5 on stage 1. (15 total)

Looking at the board state now. I can't win with only 9 cards left in my deck. And loosing 3 a turn. I have to make 10 more progress on stage 1 and 25 on stage 2.

I really like the idea of questing hard like this deck does bit it also has to be able to pull the Patrol out and be able to deal with it every round. The Vigilant Dúnadan is a great idea to defending everything but I need to seriously buff it's defense. Maybe switching to tactics Éowyn might help to get some defense. And she can also deal with 1 Patrol or Troll.

I think I Have an idea. Scrap the Vigilant Dúnadan part of the deck. Put in 3 Unexpected courages for Círdan. Boost his defense with Lords of The Eldar which is playable only from the dicard pile. And put in 3 copies of Ride Them Down. Which will allow the quest points to take out the Patrol.

The Dwarf Pipes are useless without a dwarf and the Ered Luin Miners whiff in your hand more than  getting out for free. 

I think I'm almost there but I need to tweak some more.

During a livestream last night, me and the Card Talk crew finally beat the scenario 3p. unknown.png?width=1158&height=658 [https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/453351730428510228/711406451071123516/unknown.png?width=1158&amp;height=658]

We got lucky though, we had to use 2 players to take on all enemies and I had to rely on a lucky draw for Untroubled by Darkness to quest through to the end. Final encounter card was a Hideous Deeps, which took 3 of the 4 cards left in my player deck. So with 1 card left in my deck and 2 dead players (Mono-Lore VD deck and a Silvan deck) we eventually won. But we wouldn't have made it for another turn, and if that Reek treachery came up, or the Torech Gorgor Patrol, then we would have lost. 

The strategy used was to have the mono-Lore deck use high cost Lore cards to deal with the quest, for instance The Great Hunt for the Patrol and Gildor's Counsel to reduce the encounter cards per round. Haldir+Legacy Blade helped out with ranged attacks to kill Werewolves and Spiders. Dwarves had to rely on Untroubled by Darkness and Dain Ironfoot to quest hard whenever we could. We used Naith Guides from the Silvan deck to keep Sulien ready and used Lore resources to use her ability to basically quest double and not be affected by location lock. Dwarves also had a lot of recursion with Dwarf Pipe, To Me O My Kinsfolk, etc. Silvan deck provided additional support with questing and Ranged attacks, but was the first to die. The good thing is that if you know you are going to get decked, you can have that player take the biggest enemies and help the other players as much as possible so that they have an easier time. Including Ered Luin Miners and Hidden Caches is also highly advised! I discarded 3 Hidden Cashes at once, setting me up with enough resources to afford my allies. Ered Luin Miner got discarded for setup, so I started with a free ally, which is nice for the deck to get to 5 Dwarves quickly. Ever My Heart Rises eventually got discarded to a shadow effect, but it was free threat reduction and readying for my Dwarves since all locations are Underground.

All in all, the quest is very brutal, and we won by YOLO-questing on the final turn, with 2 encounter cards that could have cost us the game. But the victory was very sweet in the end (especially since it was 4am for me at the time)

Best of luck with your games everyone. Looking forward to your strategies.

Hi Durins Father will you guys be posting the video somewhere? if like to watch that play through

## 53 [asgardianphil on May 17, 2020](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/308032-beating-under-the-ash-mountains/?do=findComment&comment=3940799)

Well done guys. Super victory. I'm almost there with solo play. 

I've tweaked my deck again. Substituted Círdan for Beregond. I'm thinking of engaging the Patrol as early as possible and capturing it with Forrest Snare using Reforged to play it from discard. If I draw it then Éowyn will discard it. 

I was toying with the idea of replacing Galadriel with Glorfindel spirit but I want the threat reduction and card draw she brings in searching for Nenya. I've changed the Toymaker for Miners too. 

 

Game 14

50 cards

Heroes: Beregond, Galadriel and Éowyn 

Threat Dial 28

Mono spirit. 

Draws: Ride Them Down, Forrest Snare, Galadriel's Handmaiden, Nenya, Ered Luin Miner and Unexpected Courage. 

Great starting hand bar the miner. Almost too good to be true. 

Setup 

Discards 4 cards: 

Ioreth 

Arwen Undómiel 

Unexpected Courage 

Ered Luin Miner (put in play)

Put Torech Gorgor Patrol in staging 

Put The Tunnels of Torech Gorgor in staging. (I think this is the toughest one due to taking a minimum of 4 turns if you get locations out). 

Search for the One Ring and put it on Beregond. 

Search for Inner Strength and add to hand. 

 

Turn 1

Draw Pelargir Shipwright. 

Planning: play Inner Strength and Unexpected Courage on Beregond.

Quest: commit Éowyn and Ered Luin Miner. 5WP. Éowyn discards Forrest Snare. +1 WP.

Stages Mordor Cave Troll. 

6 threat vs 6WP. No progress made. 

Engagement: optionally engage the Patrol. Makes an immediate attack. Beregond defends for 5. (Shadow is Twisted Tunnel. Discard Ash Mountain Werewolf. Add to staging).

I took a gamble here thinking if I use Inner Strength the next shadow might remove an attachment. Hopefully I can ride it down) no damage to Beregond and he reduces threat. TD 26. Beregond readies with Unexpected Courage. 

Combat: Beregond defends the Patrol for 5 def. (Shadow is Fearful Shadows. Cannot ready... Use Inner Strength to cancel it. TD 27.

Refresh: TD 28

Discards 3 cards Galadriel's Handmaiden, Stand And Fight  and Thrór's Key.

 

Turn 2

Seems no matter what deck I bring the encounter deck performs in exactly the right way to stop me. Every thing bad happens just at the right time in just the right way. 

Still feel the Ered Luin Miners are weak if you have to pay to get them out. But they do go out for free which is nice.

That's awesome I'm watching it in stages. I'm 1 hr 18 mins in and Galadriel has just exhausted to draw Orophin. And it's given me the bug to have my next game. 

I'm keeping my deck the same for this 15th run. I feel like I had the full force of the encounter deck thrown at me early in the last game... troll, spider and 3 werewolves in the early turns. 

 

Game 15. 

50 card deck. 

Heroes Éowyn, Beregond (spirit) and Galadriel. Threat Dial 28

Draws Forrest Snare, Ethir Swordsman, Ered Luin Miner, Stand And Fight, Galadriel's Handmaiden and Unexpected Courage.

The snare and the Unexpected Courage is a great combo, but without Nenya or Reforged I can't play it. 

Mulligan 

Draws Galadriel's Handmaiden, Dwarf Pipe, Forest Snare, Pelargir Shipwright and Thrór's Key.

Much better. I could really use a Steward of Gondor but couldn't fit it in the deck. 

Setup: discards 4 cards-

Map of Earnil 

Unexpected Courage 

Stand And Fight 

Galadriel's Handmaiden.

Add Torech Gorgor Patrol to staging.

Add Tunnels of Torech Gorgor to staging (oh crap!) I guess Dunedain Pathfinder would be great against this side quest.

Search and add Inner Strength to hand.

Turn 3

Draws Reforged. 

Planning: play Reforged to put Unexpected Courage on Beregond. (I need to get the Patrol out of staging.) Leaving 1 resource on Galadriel. (I'm guessing that even though Reforged states to play the attachment at no cost, I haven't actually played 2 cards here for the purposes of Narrow Opening? As far as I understand it, the restriction is on playing cards from your hand and paying the full cost)

Quest: commit Éowyn and Ered Luin Miner. 

Galadriel uses Nenya to buff Éowyn. 

9 WP. 

Stages Firey Chasm. Attach Thrór's Key.

Game 16

The Dwarven Pipes are the only things that can recur 3 cards reliably and the side quests generally discard 3 cards. 

Also need a ton of quest power and need to get the Patrol out. 

The various methods of getting the Patrol take some patience and can't necessarily be done on turn 1 without mono lore reducing questing and finding the Great Hunt. 

The one way of guaranteeing taking the Patrol out of staging on turn 1 or 2 is to engage it which means getting a readying effect or throwing an ally or dwarf under the bus. 

 

So... here goes nothing. This deck will need some tweaking after this game. 

50 cards

Heroes  leadership Aragorn and Dain Ironfoot. Óin. 

Threat dial 31

Draws: To Me! Oh My Kinsfolk!, Narvi's Belt, Stand And Fight, Ered Luin Miner, Stand and Fight and Hidden Cache.

Dain plays Hidden Cache to draw Unexpected Courage. 

I have 1 spirit resource. I could get the sellsword out of the discard or hold my nerve to play Bibo to fetch a dwarf pipe. 

I'll hold my nerve. 

Quest: commit Aragorn and Óin for 7WP. 

Aragorn readies himself. 

Stages Nameless Beast. Oh crap! 

3 threat vs 7 WP. 4 progress made on stage 1.

Combat: Dain defends the Patrol with 4 def. Shadow is Ash Mountain Werewolf. No effect. 1 damage on Dain. 

Aragorn defends  Namless Beast with 2 def. Discards Celebraín's Stone adding 2 att. 3 damage on Aragorn defeating him. 

Killed by Arwens pendant... ouch! Now, there is a tale to tell. 

 

Scoop this game. I can't win now. Where the frig were my dwarves and Narvi's Belt. 

Heh just peeked and next card was Reforged. 

Looks like I should have left the Patrol for a few turns.

If you can get the three dwarf pipes and Nori out early you can get through it easier than I did. It needs someone to make a more efficient deck with that concept. 

However I'm still elated I won. 

Yay me.

This was the deck. 

https://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/16147/smokingpipesundertheashmountains-1.0 [https://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/16147/smokingpipesundertheashmountains-1.0]

There isn't a Card for Helm of Secrecy on Rings DB yet so I couldn't include it. However in hindsight I would have cut that card and put in an extra Nori. So that's what I've shown here. 

 

My win all depends on whether I was allowed to play The One Ring from the discard pile. Technically it hadn't gone out of play. It was never in play. 

I still need an answer on playing Reforged or Stand And Fight on neutral cards. I've treated it as you can't but I'm not 100% sure.

We don't have an official ruling, but the current consensus in the Discord is that the Ring's Setup text is still active even when it is in the discard pile. (You couldn't retrieve a Master card from the discard pile, because the Ring only says to search your deck, but Setup text that doesn't directly reference your deck should be fine.)

Also - congrats! Amazing use of ally Nori. Hadn't thought to use him yet

You never tried hunting party asgardianphil?

Hi, alas no. 

I kept considering the card but I didn't like the trade off of drawing something else such as a side quest or Cave Troll. (Come to think of it no card was nice in that encounter deck, even the Spawn of Shelobs were nasty due to their surge.)

I think I would have tried Hunting Party but by game 16 I realised that removing it with Great Hunt hadn't worked for me, trying to engage and Forrest Snare (without a fighting deck) hadn't really worked either. Attacking it with direct damage also hadn't worked. All mainly because of the set up required to get those cards in play from a fast shrinking player deck. Also they discard the target and it will be shuffled back into the encounter deck when stage 1 advances leaving 2 patrols to still be drawn.

I came to the conclusion that the best way to deal with the starting Patrol is with a deck that can engage the Patrol very early and clobber it or just keep it engaged with defending or Reforged Forrest Snare (reforged is better as you can place it before it attacks) so basically Beregond with Inner Strength can defend from turn 1. It's just the immediate attack for engaging you need to handle so Cram, Unexpected Courage, Armoured Destrier and Lembas Bread or any chump. However there are some nasty chumping countermeasures in the encounter deck. 

 

The trouble I had with Beregond was his 0 will power. He needed to double as a quester. I think this is why Dain and Aragorn did what Beregond couldn't. Dain boosted all the dwarves and defended too. Aragorn was able to ready from turn 1. I also needed dwarves out from turn 1 for the pipes incase I drew one, so that's the only reason why I used 2 dwarf heroes.

I don't have the next two quest packs yet so I might just build a Hunting Party deck and give it a try. See if I can beat my win with more player cards left than 1. 

Now, where did I put my pipe?

Well good job on your successful playthrough, would be interesting to see how hunting party would do. Alas, I do not have my pack yet.

## 64 [asgardianphil on May 25, 2020](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/308032-beating-under-the-ash-mountains/?do=findComment&comment=3943942)

New challenge. Win the game using Hunting Party. 

I've built a deck however it's proved quite difficult. There are only 8 scout heroes in the game and only 1 in Leadership which is in sphere for Hunting Party. Obviously the scout trait doesn't need to be in leadership but it's still slim pickings throughout the spheres. 

Fearless scout attachment could be used or any number of allys but I really want to be able to use the hunting party turn 1 if I can and I don't want to rely on other set up cards that could end up being discarded. Fearless scout is Spirit sphere and so are the Dwarf pipes and recurring cards so Spirit is needed and Leadership for the hunting party. Dwarves are needed from turn 1 and I need two spirit heroes to be able to play unexpected Courages and Handmaidens etc without needing any resource smoothing or acceleration. 

So I  came up with Gimli and Legolas duo and ended up with Dain spirit over Óin or Dwalin in spirit. Dain leadership was a good choice but I need 2 spirit heroes otherwise I need other cards to grant spirit. Gimli is needed to defend to ready Legolas and he's not going to be good enough as he has a poor defense and has to spend a resource. However he can pay for Elvenking to go on Legolas and the Galadhrim Weaver will be the target of that combo to readyblegolas and recur a card. 

There's still too much to pack into this deck and so it's lacking any healing or threat reduction at the moment but that may come when I tweak it.

Dwalin not Gloin in spirit

Anyway this is game over as threat is going to be 45 and I have the One Ring. 

It all went wrong because I didn't ready Legolas and I Lost the Weaver. 

I'll tweak and try again. I'm glad I used the Hunting Party but it is useless against enemies that are staged that round. So with this high starting threat lineup it's only going to be useful against the Patrol.

Game 19

All I've tweaked at the moment is to remove 2 Unlikely Friendship and put in 2 Steward of Gondor to put on Legolas. 

 

Heroes are Spirit Dain and Legolas and Tactics Gimli.

Threat Dial 31

50 cards

Draw: Elven-light, Galadriel's Handmaiden, Hidden Cache, Reforged, Reforged and Steward of Gondor. 

Mulligan: Galadhrim Weaver, Dwarven Tomb, Ered Luin Miner, Reforged, Unexpected Courage and Curious Brandybuck. 

Possibly a worse hand. I should have stuck with Steward and Elven-light. 

Setup 

Discards 4 cards: Galadriel's Handmaiden, Curious Brandybuck, Unlikely Friendship and Galadhrim Weaver. 

Put Torech Gorgor Patrol in staging 

Put A Haunt for Beasts in stageing. 

Search for the one ring and put it on Dain. 

Search for Inner Strength and add to hand. 

 

Turn 1

Draws The Elvenking. 

Planning: play The Elvenking on Legolas. 

Play Galadhrim Weaver shuffle a Galadhrim Weaver back into deck. 

Play Inner Strength on Dain.

Quest: commit Legolas, Gimli and Galadhrim Weaver. 4 WP

Stages Fearful Shadows. Doomed 1 TD 32. All text boxes are blank. 

3 threat vs 4 WP. 1 progress made on stage 1.

The Elvenking returns Galadhrim Weaver to hand to ready Legolas. 

Refresh:TD 33

Stages Twisted Tunnel. Adds Mordor Cave Troll to staging.

Travel: travel to Twisted Tunnel. Play 2 copies of Curious Brandybuck for free. 

Engagement: Cave Troll engages. 

Combat: Dain defends the troll with 4 def. Shadow is Hideous Deeps. No effect and 2 damage on Dain. 

Going to scoop this game as hopeless cause. Really bad Mulligan and start. 

I have another deck I'm working on designed to get Hunting Party to hand asap using Heed the Dream and Word of Command.

Your using Leadership Dain right? Gimli should be questing for 3?

No, it's spirit Dain. I wanted leadership Dain but I needed more spirit resource for the questing and Reforged. I'd have to put in songs or Narvi's Belt otherwise to resource smooth.

The vibe I'm getting with Hunting Party is not to set it up early. Use unique allies. The warrior part is easy enough. 

Also this deck wasn't a good questing deck. If the Troll hadn't turned up it might of worked. However the Troll was going to turn up anyway in turn 1 stageing. 

So:

definitely need spirit

Definitely need dwarves (for the pipe) it's a shame there'll be no Dwarven equivalent of Elf-Friend now. 

Definitely need leadership resource, unique warrior and unique Scout for hunting Party or their attachment skills. 

Back to the drawing board. 

Dain Leadership is a must. Thorin and perhaps Leadership Glóin and splash spirit with songs or belt. I've been toying with the idea of tactics Dori to boost def from turn 1. He's in sphere for Dwarven attachments and buffs.

Leadership Dain seems like a good choice, he boosts willpower and can defend great.

Since Under the Ash Mountains is finally on OCTGN I was able to play test it a bit. I had a close defeat with my Caldara Mono Spirit deck, getting just one round short of completing Stage 2, a comparatively easy win with a SpBeregond/TaEowyn/SpGlorfindel Three Hunters + Inner Strength deck and a hard win with my Arwen/Elladan/Elrohir Three Hunters deck.

It's definitely a very hard quest and I dread the moment when we will try to grapple it with our usual 4 players Fellowship.

I got try 3H with Inner Strenght. Now I just have to read on the rulings with the one ring and setup cos I know there was some debate about it. 🤣🤣

If you follow the latest rulings just hope to not draw Inner Strenght in your starting hand cause you would search for it at the last Step of Setup (after the quest Setup instructions), if you go by "common sense" you would simply add it to your hand before drawing the starting hand. Let's hope Caleb will reverse his ruling.

In the particular case of this quest, just hope you don't discard Inner Strength in the quest Setup...

Ok we finally got our hands on this quest after a long wait and played it. The first time we were trashed by it, since we make a few bad timing decisions about wheter to clear side quests or advance the main quest. The second time around, courtesy also of slightly better initial hands we were able to prevail...with literally one card left in the deck.

I must say that the quest is really good in making you feel the despair and dwindling resources of such and endeavor.

Now onto leading a revolt among slaves...
