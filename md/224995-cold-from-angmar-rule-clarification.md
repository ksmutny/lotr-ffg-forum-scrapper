# [Cold from Angmar - Rule clarification](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/224995-cold-from-angmar-rule-clarification/)

Hello,

 

This is a treachery card, used in wastes of eriador quest. The card reads:

 

"When Revealed: Each player deals 1 damage to a hero he controls. Attach Cold from Angmar to the current quest. (Counts as a Condition attachment with the text: “Treat each damaged character’s printed text box as if it were blank, except for keywords and Traits.”)"

 

Q1: Does the card stay if revealed during setup of side A of a quest, then flipping to side B? (it probably stays?)

 

Q2: Clarification on keywords is needed. I know that sentinel, ranged and other similar keywords would still work. How about Gimli (base set hero) or Gandalf (base set ally)? Gimli reads: "Gimili gets +1 Attack for each damage token on him", this is neither an action nor response etc. Is that considered a keyword and his ability would still work, or not? If not, then Gandalf reads: "At the end of the round, discard Gandalf from play." - does Gandalf stay in play as long as he has any damage on him?

 

Thanks!

1) Yes, it won't get discarded until you move to the next quest stage.

2) Once Gimli takes damage, he loses his damage boost because that is neither a Keyword nor a Trait. Once Gandalf takes damage, he loses his discard-from-play clause and would stay in play.

Thanks for response! I have also played like this, but noticed that the text for both keywords and descriptions such as Gimli and Gandalf have similar font as well as comes before actions / responses etc. Keywords are described in the rulebook as text coming before card abilities, but it also says that keywords are the ones shared between multiple cards. Please note how sentinel on Aragorn and the text for Gandalf appear similar:

Thanks!

Keywords are defined in the rules and that's the difference.

Keywords are Ranged, Sentinel, Guarded, Encounter, Surge, Doomed, Secrecy. I suppose also Archery, Permanent, Peril, Restricted, Indestructible, Regenerate, Victory, Battle, and Siege, but those aren't on Allies.

Anything else is not. That's why you get hijinks like keeping Gandalf in play, attaching restricted attachments to Eagles, not dropping ally Denethor's WP, etc.

And yes the Condition stays attached to the same quest card even when flipping from side A to side B.
