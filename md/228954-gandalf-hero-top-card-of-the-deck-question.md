# [Gandalf (hero) - Top card of the deck question:](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228954-gandalf-hero-top-card-of-the-deck-question/)

Gandalf's text allows you to play with the top card of your deck face-up.  When does that come into effect? After set-up? 

Essentially this is the scenario, that my group could not answer this question for over the weekend:

While setting up, I get to draw 6 cards, and choose on a mulligan or not.  With Gandalf hero under my control, does the top card of my deck flip so I can see what my 7th card is, before I choose to mulligan?

I would say so. Gandalf's trait is always active.

That was what I thought too, but something out there must deny this knowledge.  Its like when you win a quest and the Fry meme pops into your head...

Pretty sure there was an official response about this after Gandalf was released, and he does indeed allow you to peek at the top card of your deck before deciding whether or not to mulligan.

Heroes have to be "in play" during the mulligan step, otherwise Galdor's ability wouldn't work, so I can't see why Gandalf wouldn't do his thing at this point.

Looks like I have been playing Gandalf wrong from the start of each game then :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
