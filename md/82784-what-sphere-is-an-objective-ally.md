the hobbit card that takes all non pipe charactes from the quest apart from a chosen sphere….what is the eagles ally's sphere? neutral? none at all?

thanks

None at all.  Neutral also is not considered to be in any sphere (see the ruling on Stand and Fight + Gandalf from way back).  That treachery card will remove all non-sphered characters from the quest no matter what you choose.
