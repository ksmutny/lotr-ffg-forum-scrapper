Will someone please answer a question for me?

 

When a player is engaged with an enemy, does the enemy still contribute its threat during the quest phase? Thanks!

 No. See rules page 14: "Step 3: Quest Resolution. Finally, the players compare the combined willpower strength of all committed characters against the combined threat strength of all cards in the staging area."  Enemies you are engaged with are not in the staging area, therefore they do not count their threat.
