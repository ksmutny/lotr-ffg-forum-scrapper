Does anyone know when this will be available via the POD store? Has there been any word if this will be mass printed by FFG at some point?

Also, if you choke a Smurf, what color does it turn?

Also, also...what is the speed of dark?

It will be released as POD one month after Gen Con

My mind = blown.

 

MaO could probably defeat me before the first resource phase. I'm scared.

My friends and I played MaO at Gencon.  It was VERY difficult.  Now we only played with 3 of the 4 decks, but you start with a lot of threat on the board.  And the trecherys are rough.  I was humbled at the difficulty and glad to see we didn't just plow through it.  We lost on the final quest stage due to all 3 of us threating out on the same turn.

That is an exceptionally strange looking creature the goblin is riding on the cover of MaO there... kinda looks like someone bred a buffalo with a horse and a wolf.
