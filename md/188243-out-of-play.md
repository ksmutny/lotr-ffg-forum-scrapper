# [Out of play](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/188243-out-of-play/)

Quick (and hopefully easy) question: are cards in the discard pile considered "out of play"? Or does "out of play" refers to cards that were removed from the game by special effects (like being in the victory display, etc?)

Â 

Thanks for help

Discard pile is out of play!

Also, a card in the victory display is out of play, but it has not been removed from the game. You can still interact with cards in the victory display.
