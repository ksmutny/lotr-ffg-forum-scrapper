Hello lads,

 

i feel that i should know it years ago, but i am not sure and i haven't found anything relevant.

 

If the current quest has a condition that if it is met we advance immediately to the next quest card, but we also have an active location, and it happens that we fulfill the condition, what happens with the active location?

 

- it goes to the staging area?

- it remains as active location at the next quest card?

- or is it discarded?

 

I am with the first option which seems the most logical but sure i am not.

If there is a reference somewhere please be so kind to indicate.

 

thank you

The active location remains the active location. Source: absence of any rule saying anything different.

From core set, when you advance:

 

"The game state of other cards does not change; cards

in the staging area remain in the staging area, cards
engaged with players remain engaged, exhausted
characters remain exhausted, damage tokens and
resources remain as they are placed, and the round
sequence is not interrupted."
 
Doesn't directly talk about the active location, but "the game state of other cards does not change" is clear enough.
