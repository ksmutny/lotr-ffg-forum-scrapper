 Just wanted to express my disappointment in this thread…I'm not one of those guys who wants to get all the cards spoiled in advance from every single adventure  pack…but at least one or two cards every couple of week…the last player cards we saw are almost a month old……

## 2 [BoundForGlory on October 9, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/72409-once-again%E2%80%A6three-weeks-more-or-less-of-waiting%E2%80%A6how-disappointing-ffg-guys%E2%80%A6/?do=findComment&comment=706733)

Yeah, I was very disappointed today.  Waiting more than 21 days for news for the second time in 2 months is frustrating.

I'm looking through the most recent 8 pages of news on the FFG site, and there are only 2 news entries for Lord of the Rings LCG…

on the bottom of page 4 and the bottom of page 5.

That's all.  And those most-recent 8 pages take us all the way back into August.

I used to like to come to this website.  :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

Maybe someone should remind FFG that this is a LIVING card game.  Living things usually show signs of life more often than once every 22+ days.

I cannot but agree. But it probably takes more than a few of us crying to make up for a more frequent news. Although one would think it cannot be such a big deal to insert a Tolkien quote, write a few paragraphs, and attach a picture or two.

Yes, a little something with some spoilers, even a little one, would be very nice. As said above, I don't want the whole lot spoiled, but some idea of what is coming would be nice. Even a rough idea of dates etc.

Remember when they used to release articles with deck ideas that included a apoiler of a single card? ….  Or articles from the developers discussing how they intended certain mechanics to work?….  Hell, even the articles with FAQ's and errata's that destroyed some of our most used cards?…

Me either.

Sigh….  Those were the good old days….

They may be too busy with other game releases, but they are making a mistake. Here in Spain, news are even scarcer: we haven't received FAQ 1.3 translation.

I think ffg either

a) doesn't see it -- meaning they think there is no lack of news

b) enjoys it -- meaning they think there is no outcry for the lack of news; and this may strangly be true because there are so few people left that only those very few can protest

c) can't help it -- meaning they're really busy elsewhere; but this one is really hard to believe

I must come to FFG's defense… albeit begrudgingly

The biggest shopping day of the year and the start of the Christmas shopping season is only six weeks away. I'm assuming that FFG has a lot of products that they want ready in time. The Star Wars LCG and LotR: HoN are just two examples from their LCG product line… plus everything else.

If I was a personnel manager at FFG and I had a choice of applying manpower to blog updates or to designing and shipping a product on time, I would select the later. Even if a blog update takes a only a couple of hours, a few extra hours of design or play test is a much better investment.

I agree. Specifically, I remember the brutal disappointment that Khazad-dum wasn't out for xmas last year, and think I'd rather have no news until the actual release article - this side of 2013 - rather than the unending procession of previews such as happened with KD last year, but no game until mid-January.

Whilst I agree with part of your reasoning, it cannot be taken as an excuse. To make up a preview article is a matter of an hour at the most. The articles are often nice and interesting but they are no art literature. If there are no people who could do this in their spare time, I am more than willing to offer my free lance services.

agreed ….add the fact that others are getting news updates and the fact ive already mentioned previously- with the lack of news they have killed this forum….i mean i can count the number of regulars here on one hand

i may be wrong but the french or spanish forum has a dedicated user (must be staff) who posts the articles as a thread, perhaps this is something, as lleimmoen says, that could be undertaken by a forum member

 This time slot is always fairly dead for news on game lines. In between the christmas push and the end of major events like gencon.

If they had sorted out "competitive" versions of this co-op game then we might be included. (most of the recent news articles have been about the tournaments associated with FFG's more competitive lines).

 

Ideally this game would get a new release every month, which would keep forum activity constant (and purchases) throughout the year - whether this is feasable for FFG to aim for is the question. There is a limit to how much they can "preview" a product without just telling us everything in it.

 

Also how many people really care? I mean, if nothing new to talk about I don't come here - but that doesn't bother me. Obviously the people that love just this game care more - but I have several games and products I follow from FFG. I'm quite happy to just be patient. (FFG usually has a lull in news announcments this time of year on all game lines in my experience).

I vote for this. I am currently planning weekly "My Hobbits For A…" and it would be cool to see other people's thoughts on various matters.

Yeah, and it took CS a few days (by which I mean something like five) to get back to me on a silly little question that they would, at other times of the year, get back to me on the same day or next day. They are way busy with stuff and there's not enough hours in the day.

Q4 for any retail site or store is a time of absolute craziness.

I wanted to add this actually. The lack of the activity here may not seriously damage the sales. It just makes the few fan(atic)s like me a bit more sour.

i have tried it, other people have tried it- its a good idea, but with no one around who's going to post?

admitedly mine was on tolkien lore, so i guess people may have more luck with card-talk

also i think the problem is, taking out tolkien-talk, then we have sort of ran out of things to talk about….no news, no new cards…people are already doing strategy threads….sort of nothing left

I appreciate you trying to calm the (dwindling) masses, but I don't buy the busy excuse for one minute.

They have posted 6 pages of news for other games since they posted the latest LotR news.  It's been 24 days!  This "living" card game appears to be a "Comatose Card Game."

If the 2 or 3 people who usually post the articles are seriously ill, or were fired, or some other major catastrophe has happened, then I can excuse it.  Otherwise, it appears to me that they take us fans for granted and really don't care to keep us informed and interested.

C'mon, FFG, throw us a bone.  Please.

its not just this forum that slows down when there's no news. I used to visit the Cardboard of the Rings facebook page quite a lot, but even they have slowed down. They haven't posted anything new in 10 days, presumably because there's nothing new for them to talk about. So i don't visit that page as regularly anymore. And those guys used to do fortnightly podcasts too. they are still doing them but they don't get them out quite as often. its more like 3 weeks now.

That is all good free advertising for FFG, which they will end up squandering by the lack of news. When they do one little article with a card spoil on it, it's not a huge amount of work for them, but it fuels all of these other sites which does their advertising for them for free

I suppose I had in mind sort of gimmicks and challenges.  Like build a mono-sphere tactics deck that can beat X scenario.  Or an article about an un-loved hero such as Lorefindel and how one might build a deck around them.  Sure the response may not be great but if whoever does it has fun writing the article or building the deck and doing a write up then it has succeeded in my mind.  I checked out your lore articles before which were pretty interesting to me as a more casual Tolkien fan.  I guess combining lore and game discussion in some way could work..

Good to hear, I thought your Hero series was a very interesting read.

 

Ok, so I had this idea of a Challenge as beating Journey Down the Anduin with a pure tactics (and neutral) deck.  Let's just say that a few games later i've got it down to a tee and am now losing in record time.  Tactics might be out of the question but what about trying to beat it with a another monosphere?  Anyone interested in giving it a go?  Has it been done before?  Any other ideas?

??? The product page changed a bit. It's only showing one product for the new expansion/AP and it's not Heirs of Númenor, it's the first AP for that called: The Steward's Fear. I haven't seen that before. Hell the product description seems to be a cut and paste with one glaring error (emphasis added):

"The Steward's Fear follows startling turns into adventure in an all-new quest like none before it. Kicking off the Against the Shadow narrative arc, The Redhorn Gate introduces 60 new cards, including an all-new scenario, a new hero, and three copies of each new player card."

soullos - the info on the "The Lord of the Rings: Heirs of Numenor Expansion" is now placed in the "The Lord of the Rings: Deluxe Expansions" subcollection and the "The Lord of the Rings: The Steward's Fear" AP is in the "The Lord of the Rings: Against the Shadow" subcollection. So they are in the correct places now.

 

I think the next month or so will be slow news, against expectations with an upcoming film and all but I believe it is because of the upcoming film that we will see slow news from the game systems already out there (this LOTR LCG and Cubicle 7's The One Ring) all because I believe there are new upcoming products (board and card games mostly) from companies who have gained the rights to Hobbit stuff in the last year, plus FFG have just released a Hobbit card game which is not a LCG btw - http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=3555&epn=0 [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=3555&epn=0]

On the plus side we have now 4 new LCG sets to expect soonish -

 

Battle of Lake-Town Print On Demand set

The Hobbit: On the Doorstep Saga Expansion

Heirs of Numenor Deluxe Expansion

Against the Shadow Adventure adventure pack set - #1 The Steward's Fear

 

and 5 additional sets to the Against the Shadow adventure packs.

Things are looking good, just be patient with the actual releases, I think we'll see a little slow down as more and more Hobbit related stuff pours out.
