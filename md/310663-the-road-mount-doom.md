The Hour of Fate is at hand. As Frodo makes his last journey with his faithful companions, will he navigate the treacheries of Mordor and evade the Eye of the Dark Lord? Will he have the strength to do what needs to be done?

Here is the narrative for the final scenario in my narrative Saga Campaign. The Playthrough Report will follow soon...

Enjoy!

At the Cracks of Doom, the Doom of Middle-Earth shall be decided.

Here is the final Playthrough Report of my Saga Campaign, recounting Mount Doom. In previous scenarios, sometimes it took more than one attempt, but for Mount Doom I decided that I would record the first attempt. This is that attempt.
