Hi guys,

I´ve been playing this great game for a while now. But suddenly I started wondering if I was doing something wrong:

I play the german version, so the wording might not be exactly the same. Is there a difference between the following text in terms of rules?

- "When the enemy engages you trigger his ability" (Blue Pippin for example or different enemies)

- "When you engage an enemy... (Green Pippin for example)"

 

I play it like this:

When I chose an enemy from the staging area, I engage him. When I didn´t chose him but he comes to me anyway, because my thread is higher than his, he engages me.

 

This sounds logic to me but while playing a hobbit deck for example most of the time you engage enemies and by doing so most of the enemyskills wont hurt you. That seems a little bit too easy to me.

 

Thanks for your help!

The two phrases mean the same thing. At any point where an enemy has moved from the state "not engaged with you" to the state "engaged with you", then you have engaged that enemy and that enemy has engaged you.

Any time an enemy goes from not engaged to engaged, that triggers all engaged effects, no matter what caused it.  This is also in the FAQ.

 

(1.49) Engaging enemies vs being engaged
When a player engages an enemy, that enemy has also
engaged him, and when an enemy engages a player, that
player has also engaged that enemy. There is no difference
between engaging an enemy and being engaged by an
enemy. Effects that trigger “after an enemy engages you”
will trigger at the same time as effects that trigger “after
you engage an enemy.”

Inclusive of when it is taken straight from the encounter deck or discard pile and put into play directly engaged with you.

So any time any enemy goes from not engaged to engaged whether it is from the staging area or anywhere else!

Thank you guys alot! Mh.. that means I have to replay all those adventures again... At least some more fun ahead ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

 

So for example Sams skill also triggers when, lets say during the flight to the ford (2) I put a witch king from outside the game into play directly engaged with me!?

Correct... though be also aware that if an enemy is in the staging area but "considered to be engaged..." then it has at no point actually engaged you and thus will not trigger any abilities or responses

@Nerdmeister - are you sure that's correct?   As soon as it is considered to be engaged with you, that is a clear change in game-state from you not being engaged with that enemy to you being engaged with that enemy.  Why wouldn't you be able to react to it?   Is there a ruling on that?

(1.50) “Considered to be engaged” vs actual engagement
An enemy that does not leave the staging area but is
considered to be engaged with a player does not actually
engage that player, nor does that player engage it. In order
for a player to engage an enemy, the enemy card must
physically enter his play area.

Thanks! I guess I'm going to have to go reread that thing again...  forgotten too much of it apparently.
