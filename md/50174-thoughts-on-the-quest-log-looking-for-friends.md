Hi,

I just recently got this game and I love it! I'm looking for more FFG 'friends' who play this great game so that I have more people to compare stats to on the Quest Log. If anyone else is looking for more friends as well, send me a friend invite and I'll friend you.

The Quest Log seems like a really great idea. It's especially nice to be able to see the community stats. I'm hoping they add to it in the future as it'd be nice to see some other stats, like our community average score on each individual Quest. That'd be great fun to see which ones we collectively struggle with or dominate. It seems like that could be helpful for the game designers as well.

Right now we can only see community average scores broken down by player count, which is still useful though.

The current community averages for all combined Quests by player count are:

Solo Play: 31.44

2 Player: 76.19

3 Player: 111.26

4 Player: 126.37

Does everyone think those are good averages to aim for and improve upon while playing? I currently only have 2 FFG friends who play this, so I can only see a few entries, but judging (poorly) by that I'm thinking not many people have played or entered a lot of games yet and so the averages are based on our early 'learning' games, possibly many with just the pre-made decks. So maybe these numbers can be improved upon.

Other thoughts on the Quest Log? Do people like it & more importantly plan to use it? Are the numbers bad? Etc?

I would also like to have more forum friends to be able to compare scores in the quest log.

I think the quest log is an awesome feature for the game.  I've noticed that not many new entries have been entered since it first came out though.  The community average for successfully completed quests is only 4.47 right now.  I've entered every game I've played since the quest log was released.  I'd love to see more quests logged by the community.

I like to score below the community average, but I don't necessarily try to.  I usually try to beat my best score for the quests.  I'd like to complete each quest with each number of players.

 Thanks for the 'friend', Kiwina!

Yeah, I noticed that too but just figured many people were just now starting out since the 1st printing sold out pretty quickly. But yeah, maybe people just don't use it or stopped using it.

Still, it's a great resource imo. I hope more people start to use it.

Weird that it doesn't show the failure games in with the results as well, so the stats like Hero Weight are only based on the win games.

An average win percentage would be neat eventually too.

I think I have the same goal as you, try and win every scenario with every player count.

I think it makes a lot of sense that fail statistics aren't included, as many players will no doubt log only a fraction of their failed attempts. I know I stopped logging every single game after losing Dol Guldur 15 times in a row solo. Now I only log wins, plus failed games with new hero combinations. Feel free to send me a friend request btw.

I thought this was a really great idea when they first announced it, but I've been quite disappointed with how it works in practice, and how little response there has been to feedback:

The fact that if you log a multi-player game, it only registers YOUR heroes, not those of your friends

The fact that you can only see the hero-weught screen after logging a new quest

(as mentioned above) The act that only successful quests are noted for the stats

 

1st & 3rd points seem to particularly skew the stats we see

It'd also be nice to be able to log some of the more popular 'unofficial' quests - like Ninjadorg's - that and not be told I've ONLY done 75% of the quests, just because I don't have Hunt for Gollum, despite pre-orderring it months ago!

The Quest Log did give me an idea for a new deck after the stats showed I had three Heroes left that had not yet won me a game. So I made the Bilbo / Denethor / Theodred deck and just defeated Mirkwood in a long game. Initially I didn't give this particular combination much chance, as they are horrible questers and not much better fighters, but with a few Song of Kings in combination with Bilbo's awesome card draw, I got out the army of allies eventually and made my way past the spiders. Next up: the Troll!

As the Quest Logger says it is for logging your "best game scores " I have always assumed that it is only intended for logging victories. As of late I have been trying the game with less than ideal deck construction (one core set) while waiting patiently for Gollum and consequently have had no victories to record!

I think you can see the Hero Weight screen on the Summary page, but yeah I hear ya on the other points.

Yeah, I probably shouldn't bother logging the lost games either since they don't show up anywhere. Maybe that's for the better as I get the feeling there will be many a loss with this game, lol. I love that it's challenging though. Maybe that will change once our group learns to build better decks, but for now it's really great.

Yeah, it would be nice to enter the heroes your friends use, and have the failed quests affect hero weight.  I use the notes section to keep track of that stuff right now.  It would be awesome if FFG continues to tweek the log to make it better as time goes on.  I'm not sure how I feel about the percentage thing.  I really liked seeing that I had completed 100% of the quests, but it was a sad day when that 100 became a 75 and there was nothing I could do about it.

I've logged my losses so I can use the notes section to describe what happened.  I've had some interesting patterns.  I've only tried Journey down Anduin solo four times, but two of those four times my first turn had Misty Mountain Goblins, the Hill Troll, and Gladden Fields in the staging area while questing.  Another time it was Misty Mountain Goblins, the Hill Troll, and the Brownlands.  I wouldn't have remembered the specifics without the log, just that there was something odd about that string of losses.

Hero Weight is going to have a whole new meaning when we finally see The Burly, Battlin' Bombur! Don't be fooled by the six dwarves it takes to lift him to the dinner table, oh no. He's just conserving his strength for more serious tasks!  Oh it's somebody else's turn today... to take a beating!

Bumping this thread as I am digging through the forums reading some of the older stuff I missed.

Are you guys still open to forum friend invites to compare quest logs? Any other newcomers logging quests?

Do you guys put your deck lists in the notes section? I have just been putting general comments like if it was a 50-card or 30-card deck, etc. Going to try and encourage some multi-player at my gaming hangout each week and log any victories. First attempt wasn't very good because of a power outage and I only brought the Journey Along the Anduin scenario which brutalized the two people brave enough to play. Next week I will start them off a little easier.

Yes, I am still open to forum friend invites.

I haven't put a deck list on my comments.  I've also used the comments for more general things, and some situational stuff.  Hopefully your friends will also get into the game.  I have a few that will play, but none of them really do much with deck-building right now.

Also still open to forum friend invites.

At the moment, I tend to put a fairly broad note on the deck. How many spheres, or what cards are in from a very minor sphere, plus a note every time I use a new chapter pack for the first time (and exra cards)

as the card base expands, I guess decklists will be more significant. Not sure if that means i'll be including them in full tho!

I don't put decklists, but I have been keeping track of my friends' Hero selections in the notes for multiplayer games since there is nowhere to log those. That seems just as significant as the Heroes I choose, as it greatly affects my ability to win the quest as well.

Hhmm, I do compare quests with friends in the quest log I cant see the notes they have written/included (not even my own). Am I doing something wrong? Where you can read the notes other people included?

I don't see the option to view the notes of other players either. Didn't realize we couldn't when I posted the bit about what to include in the notes section. Guess it's just to remind ourselves what we used or did during games.

Ok, somewhat related question: is there an easier way to get to the quest tracker than going to the support page for the game?  Like a link in the profile I'm not seeing or something?  It takes several clicks to get there, which is annoying.

 Sure - in the top banner, where you see "| News | Catalog | Upcoming ...", hover your mouse over "More..." and select "Lord of the Rings Quest Log".

I just wanted to say that I'm open to friend invites as well.

I just favourited the log page on my browser.

I don't have any friends who play on these forums, so if anyone wants to friend me for the log I'd be more than happy to accept.
