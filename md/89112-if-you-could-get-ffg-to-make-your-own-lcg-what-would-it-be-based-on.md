so we all love our favourite lcg here on the lord of the rings part of ffg's site, but if you could have ffg make another, and it could be based on anything, what would you choose and why?

 

i think it would have to be a WW2 game, as i am pretty much obsessed with WW2 strategy games and the period in general.

 

it would have to be solo for me, but i would be dissapointed if they took the allies as the playable faction, as i would personally prefer playing the axis (that doesnt represent any political view by the way, i just like 'what if' historical situations), though i guess they could have both like the spheres in lotr. (though it would be impossible as one would have to be the encounter deck)

 

heroes would be commanders or country leaders such as Churchill, Rommel, Montgomery and so on, and i could see cards split up into infantry, aircraft, tanks and seacraft.

 

events could be strategic descisions, such as retreat, rout, offensive, encirclement, entrenchment

 

attatchments could be brigades such as in the Hearts of Iron PC game, like artilery, tank busters and so on

I'm really not interested much on WWII in games (then again, my country hasn't had many great wars so I get it if you're from the UK or something). But something I'd love to see as an LCG (besides the novel I'm writing now lol) would be the Dark Tower series by Stephen King. As I'm reading them right now and I love them, it would be a pretty amazing game (extremely hard to adapth though).

ah yes, SK is a master, though the shining ranks as my favourite (and favourite film of all time). but yes, he was onto a good thing when he mixed Lotr and the 'wild west' ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

 

and yes, i am english, and if there is something the english knows something about, its waging war (not a good thing by any means)

My long-standing wish is for a Star Trek LCG, based in TNG/DS9 timeframe. My ideal format would be a cooperative game a la LOTR where each "quest" is like a mission (or perhaps several missions), and you could also play as different factions.

The co-op Star Wars LCG that was originally demoed (before being scrapped and turned into a 2-player game) was as close to my dream game as I can imagine. The LotR LCG has become my favourite game, but the Star Wars theme holds more appeal for me. Regardless, I now own and enjoy both games anyway!

I'm a comic nerd.  I would like to see a decent attempt at a Marvel Universe LCG.

I don't really have a new theme. But I agree 100% with scwont. A solo/co-op version of SW LCG would be great. Actually, I'd almost be happy with whatever theme as long as it can be played solo. That goes for both AGoT, CoC, WHI and SW. Of cause, I think I would be most happy if it could be a solo player version of Netrunner, but I have a hard time seeing that coming true. Almost contradictionnary. If there's such a word :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

EDIT: On second thoughts, maybe a LCG based on one of David Eddings' universes. Either the Eleniu,/Tamuli or the Redemption of Althalus. Though the last one would really adapt into a great magical strategy game that might be better suited for a boardgame/miniature.

Dune or Romance of the Three Kingdoms would be great, but they're both fairly similar to A Game of Thrones. Failing that, Sherlock Holmes could be interesting.

The Prisoner (the 60s series with and created by Patrick McGoohan). The general idea: you fight against plots that try to break you and make you reveal the reasons you resigned. The player on the other hand tries to compromise No 2 plans and reveal who No 1 is.

Woah. Dune is a great idea. I read lotr when I was 13 or so and Dune the next year. They both have that depth of lore to draw from for an ongoing game like this. Personally I have always favored robert jordans wheel of time series over game of thrones. Would have said it earlier but with LotR And GoT already representing high fantasy I think we are good there.

Oh, yeah! This would be unlike any of FFG's other LCGs. It should have lots of secret play to reflect the mind-melting paranoia of the setting.

I'm not sure there's scope for another solo (or players vs game) LCG. I believe this is why star-wars was rethemed to be 3v1 and 1v1 instead.

 

Personally I'd like to see Lord of the rings the card game second edition.

I love Dune too. There is a Dune ccg was releases in 1997. Was 3 or 4 sets before is gping down and die. You still can play in octgn. Great game.

D&D has been dead to me since 4th edition.

 

Paizo has continued with the Open Game License and made an, only slightly modified, continuation called Pathfinder, which in turn has spawned this card game recently: http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/133038/pathfinder-adventure-card-game-rise-of-the-runelor [http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/133038/pathfinder-adventure-card-game-rise-of-the-runelor]

LOL HAHAHA. You know I would TOTALLY dig a Harry Potter LCG... with Different artists than handled the books thank you very much.

 

Also... Glaurung. WHAT? Dune CCG! WAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHTTTTT!??!?!!?! Wow... you know I usually don't mind being way out of the loop on most of these things but I can't believe that one passed me by. I guess I was still pretty young back in 1997.

 

As far as DnD is concerned, I still consider Pathfinder to be Dnd and I'm pretty excited about their new card game. It sold out super quick at Gen con so neither I nor any of my gaming group were able to secure a copy 

 

Back on topic, I think Dune and Harry Potter would be my top two picks for a new LCG. They would both be sweeet

i would quite like a world war II game as well, but not a big army vs army battle one. i would quite like a mission based one, sort of like LOTR -- with stories, characters, locations and events etc. your player deck would be made up of infantry, tanks, aircraft, navy, weapon upgrades, special forces, commanders... and you can build your deck depending on the type of mission.

each cyle could move onto a different theatre of the war -- france, germany, russia, africa, asia -- and the different "spheres" could be land, air, sea and special forces. the "races" could be the different nations -- english, french, russian, americans, aussies... it actually fits quite well in the LOTR format

thats a great idea. there is a boardgame called field commander rommel which sounds quite like that....based upon the campaign in north africa. there you obviously command armies, but its overall smaller scale than what it should be, hence greatly smoothing out the game (well, from what i have heard, i have yet got it myself)

Seems like the developer has a more traditional TCG model in mind, with randomised boosters available for in-game or real-world currency.

Hi All,

 

Firstly - found reading posts on this forum very helpful with understanding how to play this game - thanks to all the posters!

 

Secondly - only really interested in Solo/Co-Op gaming options as few friends have time to play regularly these days. So as long as FFG included a solo option I would consider it...

 

Stargate would probably top my list - though I'd prefer a fourth team member/Hero :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

and the previously mentioned:

Wheel of Time

Dune

Starwars (Solo/Co-OP) version

Marvel Universe

 

would all be very tempting.

Uhhhggghhh I want to be all like "yeah stargate!" But I just know woz or glaurung are going to softly inform me that a card game already exists.... hahaha

But seriously that one does make me raise an eyebrow

I don't know about the sherlock idea... thematically I. Think it would work. Great atmosphere and lots of action and material buuuuut artistically aside from the recent movie adaptations and the bbc series I have never...ever seen a picture of Holmes or Watson that I liked. Very artistically motivated person here. Will more likely buy a mag for a fancy cover than for the content

So far Harry Potter and Dune are my fav suggestions, though id give a WoT or Stargate lcg a chance

Btw welcome to the forum, but more importantly... welcome to the game! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
