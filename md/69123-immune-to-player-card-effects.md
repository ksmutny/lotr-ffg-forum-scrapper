This is probably a ridiculous question but what exactly does "immune to player card effects" mean?

this is close:

"Immune to Card Effects
The location East-gate has the text, “Immune to card
effects.” This means that East-gate cannot be selected as
the target of any card effect, and it ignores the effect of any
card that would directly interact with it. The only way to
place progress tokens on it is by questing, and once Eastgate
is the active location it remains the active location
until it is fully explored (even cards like Dreadful Gap or
Strider’s Path would not be able to move it to the staging
area)."

Since an upcoming hero has the text "Immune to Player Card Effects" this means we cannot heal the hero, correct? Or play any other effect on the hero? Can the hero have weapons or armor?

As I read it, the answer to your questions would be "Correct.  No.  No."

Specifically, it mentions, "Cannot have attachments.  Immune to player card effects."

So unless there was some sort of ENCOUNTER card that allowed you to heal a hero (highly unlikely I would think… but possible- there have been locations that let you draw cards when explored, sooo….), then no healing is available for him.  And since off the top of my head all weapons/armor are currently attachments, then none of them are allowed either… But these are separate conditions.  Contrast this to the upcoming Bilbo hero that prevents gaining resources from player card effects, but has nor attachment restrictions.

Yup, with his Sentinel keyword, 5  attack strength ( and 0 willpower), and "Does not exahust to defend" clause, it's pretty apparent what he's out there for…  defend then attack, defend then attack, defend… you get the idea.

Just to throw this out there. This Term was under the Rules & New Terms in the pamphlet book that comes with the game.

 

Immune to Player Card Effects

Cards with the text "Immune to player card effects" ignore the effects of all player cards. Additionally, cards that are immune to player card effects cannot be chosen as targets of player card effects.

I can see some rules problems coming up…..

Is the text on Beorn still active if he is in the discard pile?

If he is still immune then you can't play Fortune or Fate on him or use Landroval, annoying but understandable. The problem is what happens when he ends up in your deck (Lost and Alone). Can the stargazer see him? Can Berevor or Gleowine draw him? Can Zigil miner discard him?

Most other card games rule that the card is just a card unless it is in play. That gets around a lot of these problems and would imply that you can play Fortune or Fate on Beorn.

Thoughts anyone?

i dont particularly like it, but i guess you could say with him being his own master and as stubborn as a mule, no other cards would work on him (but as said before- even his own event!)

well id say that he cant be brought back- im pretty sure of that at least

however as for stargazer im not sure….i mean you look at 5 cards and dont know he is there so that cant be helped, but tampering with him is after all an effect

## 15 [Captain Poe on August 15, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69123-immune-to-player-card-effects/?do=findComment&comment=674159)

Cinematically, the mechanic works well, I think. Beorn was very much a loner at  the time of the hobbit. A bit of a crazy old hermit. He didn't particularly work well with others, and didn't particularly want to. However, he hated orcs and wargs with a passion, and was willing to warm up some over the common enemy. However, as they were entering the woods, the dwarves started to give hint that they wanted to keep his poneys for the trek through mirkwood. Gandalf made it pretty clear that doing so would make an enemy of beorn. Even after they had befriended him, he was still mostly concerned with himself and his animals over the well being of the other free peoples.

 

It wasn't until later that he became something of a leader amongst the beornings.

I would say his text will have no effect in discard pile or in the deck, both of which are in a "out of play state".  Card effects are effective only if the card is "in play", unless otherwise noted.  So I think he can be brought back by Fortune or Fate.  Just my 2 cents.

It seems like in this case, that Beorn could not be targeted by Fate or Fortune even though he is in the discard pile. However abilities like Stargazer target the deck so it wouldn't apply.

I'm tempted to agree with you since stargazer wouldn't target Beorn to look at the deck, but it most certainly would effect him during the "put back in an order" part. The same would need to hold true for Gandalf's search. How you resolve these effects, I don't know.

I think you must be right. When it is in a discard pile, then Beorn's text cannot apply. Thus there is at least one card that combos well with Beorn, I feel. But I might ask about it to be sure.

Maybe at some point FFG will make a "Turn into a big freaking Bear!" event or attachment card with text stating to ignore the immunity text on Beorn. That way only specific cards could be used on him. It seems messy though.

## 21 [Bullroarer Took on August 16, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69123-immune-to-player-card-effects/?do=findComment&comment=674810)

 impaulm has a really good point.  I was surprised to see that Beorn made the first box in the first place.  I was expecting it to be ALL dwarves and then we would see the non-dwarf heroes in the second box.  So the idea of an event or attachment that gives Beorn regenerate 1, or +2 def is not out of the question.

## 22 [lleimmoen on August 16, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69123-immune-to-player-card-effects/?do=findComment&comment=674832)

i was thinking something similar, i though Beorn should have had regenerate 1 but i am no designer… i really hope we shall see cards that weaken enemies, could help out Beorn some way

Not to be contrary (which means that I'm going to be… lol), but I believe this reasoning is incorrect.  The rulebook clearly states that:

Page 25 "In Play and Out of Play":
"In play" refers to cards that have been played or put into play (in a player’s play area), to cards that are waiting in the staging area, to the currently revealed quest card, and to encounter cards that are engaged with that player. "Out of play" states are" in a player's hand," "in a deck," or "in a discard pile.” Card effects do not interact with cards in an out of play state unless the effect specifically refers to that state."

And on page 6 (under "Card Anatomy Key"), it states that:

"10. Game Text: The special abilities unique to this particular card when it is in play."

 

So, by combining those rules/guidleines, Beorn's text is not ACTIVE while in the draw deck or discard pile.  Therefore, he should be eligible for player card effects that target those areas (search cards, Landroval, etc).

I didn't have time to scour the FAQ's/updates to see if there was anything that might contradict this, I will do so when I have more time (read: NOT at work.. .lol).  If anyone has more current info, please educate me, thanks!

Well found, that would make sense and fits in with how I'd like the card to work.

I haven't ran a lot of Tactics yet, and wasn't too thrilled to see Beorn's text.  It seemed a bit…. ummmmm….   Dull.  Just to be honest.

Let me clarify:  This game is really designed around its heroes.  Specifically, being able to get maximum useage out of them.  Notice how many of the "power" cards in this game are centered around that concept (UC, all the Aragorn/Glor/Elrond/Dwarven/etc. attachments).  So getting a hero (even with big stats) that will just kind of sit there, like a glorified meat-shield and be completely unable to interact with the rest of your deck except to generate rewources OR get searched for (if you are unlucky enough for him to get killed/discarded/buried) seems VERY anticlimactic. 

Despite my lack of excitement about his deck capabilities, I could see him slipping nicely into an Eagle deck perhaps.  Paricularly since Landroval is one of the FEW cards that can have any affect on him.  He would definitely fit the defend/attack theme they fill….

Yup, so flavour-wise, it all makes more sense that he can't wear any armour or wield any weapon ^^

Clever designers strike again!

 

I'm really excited about this hero, by the way. He can basically block and destroy anyhting in early game on his own. The longer the game, the less useful he becomes, but still, blocking anything, anywhere is incredible. Who cares if he takes a bunch of damage, he's got 10 freaking hit points :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

in fact, he's the first Tactics hero I'm really excited about (well, and Háma).

Can Dori use his response to take the damage instead of Beorn ?

"Response: After a hero is assigned any amount of damage, exhaust Dori to place that damage on Dori instead."

The response seems to target the damage, not the hero, so does the immunity apply ?

In the Hobbit Rules it states: Cards with the text "immune to player card effects" ignore the effects of all player cards. Additionally, cards that are immune to player card effects cannot be chosen as targets of player card effects. 

I think that second sentence would mean that neither Dori or mocking would work.

No, not exactly.

Song of Mocking instructs you to "choose a hero" as the target of its effect. Since Beorn's immunity text specifically prevents him from being the target of player card effects, you can't use SoM to pull damage away from him. 

Dori, on the other hand, does not interact with Beorn directly; instead, Dori just redirects the assigned damage. Beorn never becomes the target of a player card effect.

Barring an official ruling to the contrary, Dori can pull damage away from Beorn, but SoM cannot.

I think the above is a perfectly correct assumption. But the "official rulings" tend to surprise. I would think it a bit anticlimactic indeed if no cards were able to combo with Beorn, unless we get some to support him later, like "All enemies attacking Beorn get -2 Attack Strength until the end of the phase."

Hi,

I'm still a little confused about "immune to player card effects". Not only Beorn, but also the new Smaug from the PoD "Battle for Lake-Town".

But…what about the cards that target your hero/ally/player but interact with the enemy (Smaug)? For example:

Quick Strike
[Event]
Action: Exhaust a character you control to immediately declare it as an attacker (and resolve its attack) against any eligible enemy target.

Thicket of Spears
[Event]
Text: You must use the resources from 3 different heroes' pools to pay for this card.
Action: Choose a player. That player's engaged enemies do not attack this phase.

Stand Together
[Event]
Text: Action: Choose a player. That player may declare any number of his eligible characters as defenders against each enemy attacking him this phase.

Obviously, I'm trying a tactics deck against Smaug… demonio.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/demonio.gif]

 Maybe this should go on Rules sections, but I recycle this thread….

 

 

## 37 [Angus Lee on November 8, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69123-immune-to-player-card-effects/?do=findComment&comment=720262)

For Quick Strike, the effect is "to immediately declare it as an attacker …", where "it" refers to the character exhausted as cost.  So the effect would involve the selected hero and Beorn cannot be chosen for Quick Strike.

Similarly, for Stand Together, "That player may declare any number of his eligible characters as defenders …", Beorn will not be an eligible character because he is immune from card effects.

However, in Thicket of Spears, the first sentense is a limitation on paying the cost of the event, but not a card effect.  So you can pay for this event with Beorn's resource.  The event's effect only target a player but not a character, so Beorn is not involved in resolving this card's effect and is legal.

 As I see the Smaug questions:

You can use quick strike against Smaug as it targets a character (enabling him to attack) not Smaug itself (he is not immune to being attacked after all and the card opens a special attack window)

You can't block him with ticket of spears as he would ignore its effect and still attack (other enemies would not attack though).

As for stand together it seems that it is a bit complicated and I say:
In spirit of the rules:
You could defend his attack as the effect targets "mechanics" of defending not the Smaug itself
As far as written rules go:
The way the stand together is worded it seems that each enemy is its target hence Smaug would ignore its effects and you could not declare multiple defenders.

 I agree with both Angus and wojo's interpretations

Thanks both AL and Wojo for your replies!

 But, according at how the 3 cards are worded, shouldn't work the same way? I mean, in all of them, the "action:" forces you to choose/target a hero/ally/character you control (paying it's cost). Then, the effect resolves.

So, What's the line for "immune to player cards"? Immune when the card (Smaug) is the target as part of the cost? Immune when the effect resolves, and target the card (Smaug)? Both of them?

You don't actually target a hero when you use their resources, otherwise Beorn would be incapable of using his resources at all.

The difference in who can/can't affected by each of those cards is in the nuance of who they target an who their action effects affect.  

Quick Strike targets a character, and allows that character to make an attack outside of the normal combat phase.  It targets a character, so Beorn can't be affected by it.  The card effects of Quick never actually targets the enemy, just the character who is declaring a attack.  Since the Smaug can be hurt by attack made by characters, he will take damage if your character is strong enough to break though his defense.

Like Angus said, Stand together is basically the same.  The card effect only affect characters, not the enemy.

Thicket of Spears is the only card of the three who's written effects affect enemy cards, so Smaug would be immune to it.

 

This next comment is going back to some earlier posts about Beorn's immunity to attachments.  There is one benefit to it.  He is also immune to encounter attachments.  Sack cards (Carrock and We Must Away) and Tentacle attachments (Watcher) don't affect him either.

Thanks Kiwina!,

Now I've a clear idea of what can and can't play against Smaug. Sad that the best card to go against Smaug (Thicket of Spears) is useless. llorando.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/llorando.gif]

 Hm, I'm reading these a little differently.

Quick strike targets a character.  Beorn can't be targeted.  Smaug can be attacked. (sounds like we all agree here)

Stand together targets a player.  You should be able to use this with Beorn, and you should be able to defend attacks from Smaug with multiple characters when using this card.

Thicket of Spears also targets a player.  The card text doesn't target Smaug at all.  It's more like an immunity granted to the player (like Burning Brand).  Smaug wouldn't attack the player.

We know that Dori can help Beorn: Dori has a very clear and direct benefit for Beorn, but because the damage is intercepted and Beorn is only indirectly involved, this is legal.  It seems to be the same case for Stand Together and for Thicket of Spears.  Neither of the immune cards are targeted by the Stand Together or Thicket of Spears.  Sure the result changes the environment for the immune cards, but because the cards do not act directly on them, there is nothing for the immunity to prevent.

That is my interpretation, and it might be a minority interpretation.  I do think we need official elaboration on immunities in general.

This is probably a ridiculous question but what exactly does "immune to player card effects" mean?

this is close:

"Immune to Card Effects
The location East-gate has the text, “Immune to card
effects.” This means that East-gate cannot be selected as
the target of any card effect, and it ignores the effect of any
card that would directly interact with it. The only way to
place progress tokens on it is by questing, and once Eastgate
is the active location it remains the active location
until it is fully explored (even cards like Dreadful Gap or
Strider’s Path would not be able to move it to the staging
area)."



What can you tell me about the interaction between Esgaroth Wharf (TBoLT) and Northern Tracker (Core)? Does the ability on the former block the Response effect of the latter?

And, more generically speaking, does "card" in LotR LCG refer only to cards in players hand or even to characters, attachments, etc in play? Sorry for the silly question, but I'm coming from a MtG background where "permanent" refers to cards in play.. =P

Thank you in advance!

So, by combining those rules/guidleines, Beorn's text is not ACTIVE while in the draw deck or discard pile.  Therefore, he should be eligible for player card effects that target those areas (search cards, Landroval, etc).

 

 

Well found, that would make sense and fits in with how I'd like the card to work.

 

 

I haven't ran a lot of Tactics yet, and wasn't too thrilled to see Beorn's text.  It seemed a bit…. ummmmm….   Dull.  Just to be honest.

Let me clarify:  This game is really designed around its heroes.  Specifically, being able to get maximum useage out of them.  Notice how many of the "power" cards in this game are centered around that concept (UC, all the Aragorn/Glor/Elrond/Dwarven/etc. attachments).  So getting a hero (even with big stats) that will just kind of sit there, like a glorified meat-shield and be completely unable to interact with the rest of your deck except to generate rewources OR get searched for (if you are unlucky enough for him to get killed/discarded/buried) seems VERY anticlimactic. 

Despite my lack of excitement about his deck capabilities, I could see him slipping nicely into an Eagle deck perhaps.  Paricularly since Landroval is one of the FEW cards that can have any affect on him.  He would definitely fit the defend/attack theme they fill….



 

I would have agreed up until the latest delux expansion. Beorn's stats and the fact that I can recycle him with Landroval (&did) made him on e of my strongest Hero's in the last two quests. That being said, I lost the last quest, though I was doing better than I expected thanks to Beorn.

"immune to player card effects" means any player card (event, attachment, ally or hero) cannot target that card.  Once a card is in the discard pile the text on the card is no longer active. So Beorn can be resurrected with "Fortune or Fate" or "Landroval".

Northern Tracker gets blocked because it's effect is a player card effect that would target the location. "Cards" are all cards on the table.

Now I'm even more sure Lake-Town is an ridicolously hard quest… =(
