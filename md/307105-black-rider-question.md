Hi guys,

When a Black Rider is revealed and the player fails a hide test, is the attack made from the staging area or is the black rider put in front of the current player?

Regards

It would attack from the staging area. Deal it a shadow card and resolve it like a normal attack.

This has been the subject of several different discussions in the past. This whole thread is good—I specifically link to a reproduction of the ruling itself (spoiler: the Black Rider engages you first):
