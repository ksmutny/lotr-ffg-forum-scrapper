 What happens to the Active Location when a stage of a quest is completed?

Page 22 of the Rulebook states "The game state of other cards does not change" -- this seems to clearly indicate that the Active Location stays active with the new Quest card (example: I was on Quest 2, facing the Hill Troll with enough Progress Tokens to complete the Quest Card. An Location was then made Active to help reduce Threat in the Staging Area. Then, the Hill Troll was defeated, allowing me to move onto the next Quest card).

I just wanted to double check. Thanks!

You're correct.  The active location would stay there until you get enough progress tokens on it.
