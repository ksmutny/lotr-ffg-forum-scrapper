accessories for the LOTR LCG. i have some ideas, some old, some new:

 

1. Art book. not a new suggestion but as the art collection gets bigger and often better, its something i want more and more

 

2. Game/Deck journal. like the campaign log we get in the insert only more like a 'gaming journal' you could use to write deck ideas down in, write deck and game reports, and keep scores in writing. the idea would be to make it a nicely designed book (though hopefully not leatherbound becuase i won't be able to use it :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] )

 

3. Game mats. Different selections of art from the game. again not new.

 

4. Deck boxes. as above.

 

5. More art sleeves. i have all the limited ones (gimli, gandalf, daughter of the nimrodel, nazgul on fell beast), i dont sleeve all my cards at once but more would be nice to collect for different decks.

 

6. tokens bag. like this only with lotr design

Game mats would be great, although sometimes the play areas for this game can become quite large so i'm not sure how feasible they would be

 

what would also be nice is a pre-constructed box or drawer designed to hold all the cards with dividers and such, i'm sure it would an expensive product but def one that is worth while for those looking for a better form of organization

agreed- for those with the need to store and bring out the game it would be ideal....i only play this game and keep it set up on a spare table, but i would imagine those who play a lot of different games set up is a nightmare

the tokes bag would be cool too. beats the plastic zip-lock i'm using now

Well for number 2, I use a normal notebook.  What I do is I write down on every page, a quest name.  So page one says at the top "Passage through Mirkwood" Then Page 4 says "Hunt For Gollum" page 5 says "Conflict at the Carrok" ect.  So then I have a whole page for each quest.  When I first play a quest and win, I write down my score on the page under a "Best score" category, and then every time I play that quest again, If I get a better score, I write it down, so I know all my high scores for all the quests.  That is the only way I keep track of scores.  So it's kinda exciting when you're like "I got my best score yet!'  

 

It would be a waste of money to buy something like that when it's so easy to make your own.  I also have lots of extra space in the notebook, so I can have a deck section and all that.

i was thinking more for the sake of it, rather than practicle purposes. i mean the token bags and storage can be made for basically nothing, and you can go without a gamin mat, but for those wanting something extra, it would be nice to have something official from ffg to compliment the game

Yeah well I'd rather spend money on something else than waste it on an "Official" FFG thing when I could make my own even better one for nothing.  But I guess your right some people want to have the "Cooler" looking one or something.

#3, 5, and 6 would be AMAZING!

I'd go for the artbook blindly. I'm sure it will come sooner or later.

 

Also the storage solution would be great. May the boxes offered in the Game Night kits be the storage solution? Are there any good pictures of those boxes?

 

I also propose a pack with the cards "missing" from the Core Set. :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

Yes i ue the box from Game night kits. I keep all quests/encounter cards there

I'd definitely buy the art book, game mats and token sleeves. The others I'd consider. The art for this game and the One Ring rpg are fantastic.

Could you post some pictures with the cards inside? Can the box be used with sleeved cards?

Except for #5, I agree. Those art sleeves are meh for me. When you want to pay more for a fancy picture on the back, be my guest, but I won't.

well for me it was ok as i only have the 4 limited sleeves to sleeve current decks. i dont sleeve encounter cards or all player cards.

i actually got the gandalf ones for £1.99 on sale which was great.

I would like to see better tokens and/or a new set of tokens for quests that need tokens for dead villagers and saved villagers. Also it would be nice if I had a set of progress tokens that had a 3 on one side and the normal print on the other side. 

 

A dial to keep track of the number of rounds. Something official but smaller than the Threat Dials.

I think the ideal would be a combo threat dial/round counter (might get big though)

none of those products interest me at all. All I need is cards and card sleeves.

+1

This would be really useful for me.

Yep. Those would be nice! I allways like tokens and round number calculator would be nice. Art book is allso must. And if we would get premium tokens, the token back is allso mandatory... Hmm.. where all of my money did go? again....

I've posted this a couple times on BGG, but the biggest thing I would love to see, would be an 'upgrade box' sort of thing. It could include:

 

-Extra copies of all the cards that weren't 3x in the core set

-Updated versions of all errata'ed cards up to this point

-Updated Encounter cards for all the old set cards that are getting upgraded to the 'gold ring' Easy Mode symbol

-Maybe a general-use Boons and Burdens deck to use with the earlier quest cycles

-A different colored dial for keeping track of rounds

 

Anything like this I would buy asap.

Never going to happen

 

Very unlikely to happen, I would say never but a reprint of a 5 year old agot pack had a few erta fixes... but you would be waiting that kind of time period IF it happend

 

Very unlikely but may happen

 

Never going to happen

 

Never going to happen - But you can make your own so easy it is just a joke.. All you need is a cool image and a printer and a clip.

Here is a wheel made for SoM. This one tracks two dials so it can go to 99.

 

All you need to do is select your fav LoTR art, print it out on thick card at the printers, or normal paper and paste it onto thick card, cut it out and pin it together with one of these

 

s0412089_sc7.jpg [http://s11.postimg.org/8gb9fcf2r/s0412089_sc7.jpg]

So you can stick the wheel to the card with no glue and it should spin easy yet firm. Take you longer to search the net for a image you like than to make the wheel. Just remember to make the cover longer, as you have to fold it around to make a pocket, otherwise when you turn it around you can see inside.

i would quite like an expanded rulebook (updated with all the FAQs of course), with lots of playing tips and combos, and maybe a bit of Tolkien history too, as it relates to the quests. A proper book, though, not just one of those magazine-style ones that they put in the core set

## 26 [Hannibal_pjv on July 22, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86325-accessorieswould-you-want-this/?do=findComment&comment=818706)

Extended rulebook would be nice, but when "every" new expansion will bring new rules, it would be old very soon... A PDF-version with all rules and all expansion adds would be nice, because it should/would be updated after each new expansion...

Extended Rulebook with some extended rules would be great, something that adds more depth? How about a cool prop map that allows you to track the story arcs you're playing in some way?
