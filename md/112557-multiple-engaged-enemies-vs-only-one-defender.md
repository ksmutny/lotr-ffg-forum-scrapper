Hello,

 

There's something I'm not quite comfortable with when it comes to engaging and defending:

 

IF there are three engaged enemies and I have only one possible defender [i mean, only one non-exhausted character]; what do I do?

 

1) do I choose the enemy who'll attack my defender [the other two enemies just sit and wait] and resolve this one attack from this one enemy?

2) do I choose the enemy who'll attack, resolve it, and the other two make a non-defending attack?

 

I'd like to thank you for your time and kindness,

 

From Brazil,

Nilton Balbi

Each engaging enemy should attack during the first part of the combat phase. If you don't declare defender, then resolve the attack as normal, and as undefended.

It is really a bad idea to have more engaged enemies than ready character to defend, but sometimes, it is not from your own will. Then you're really close to your next game were you will be more lucky, perhaps :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Alright, dear alogos,

Thank you so much for your reply...

 

Indeed it isn't much fun having two or three beasts engaging one lonely Thalin...

This game is amazing! It really got me - I've only managed to go through Flies & Spiders [using Tactics Deck only] one week after I bought it! Man, it felt good!

 

Thanks again!
