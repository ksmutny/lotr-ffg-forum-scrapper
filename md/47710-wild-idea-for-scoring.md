# [Wild Idea for Scoring](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47710-wild-idea-for-scoring/)

There has been talk about scoring being unfair due to the possibility of stalling. Here is an idea to modify the current results.

Final Score = Score + Modifier

...where Score is as defined in the rulebook

Modifier = (R - 5 + P - L) x 10

...where R is number of rounds played, P is number of players, L is difficulty level of the scenario

To make a complete formula:

Final Score = T + C + D - V + 10 x (R - 5 + P - L)

...where:

T is the total of final threat levels

C is the total of threat cost of dead heroes

D is the number of damage tokens on all surviving heroes

V is victory points earned

R is number of rounds played

P is number of players

L is difficulty level

So if you did scenario 2 with 4 players in 5 rounds or less, you'd add zero? Or possibly subtract some? and likely subtract when doing scenario 3 at all?

For example if you did just the modifier for scenario 3 4-player done in 5 rounds, you'd get (5-5+4-7)=-3x10= -30. Is that a goal to have even lower scores for 4 players than a solo spirit?

I think the numb. of players shouldn't affect the score, since you compare it to games played with the same number of players!I think we should keep only the number of rounds in the score (it is useless to compare two different scenarios as well...)

The working hypothesis was 2 rounds for four players at level 1. 3 round for 3 players, 4 for 2, I found that reasonable. For each extra round you'd add 10 points (or 5 or whatever would feel most fit). I believe there should be penalty for stalling, or bonus for swiftness. And it does take less time the more player play, naturally. The given difference is only 1 round though. For level 7 the non-bonus number of rounds would be 11 for solo, 10 for a couple and so on. Well, it is just an idea since the original idea of counting score as given in the rulebook is not working very well.

I needed the number of players and level to find the "appropriate" number of rounds in which the scenario should be done. It would be stupid to default it for every asame.

How would you complete any scenario in 2 rounds? Progress tokens do not carry over between quests so you'd need at least 3 rounds unless I'm playing something wrong.

gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif] in theory you can solve the mirkwood and the adnuin in two rounds because they have a third stage with zero need progress.

getting 8 progress and a dead troll in the first round and 16 progress plus all monsters dead in the second round maybe ab bit tough in reality, though. gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]

 

i like your idea for new scoring system but time ( and with time i mean adventurepacks) will give us some cards to regulate this tactics sphere could get cards that say if you kill a monster it counts as x victory points for example and other treachery cards or quest that say that you losse x points every round and so on.

future may solve this and other problems, so be gentle to the young gamehappy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]

Of course, you are right. It would be premature to try some specific figures, too. I wrote in the title this was wild.

And, need I add, I love the game.

We (2 players) have done Mirkwood in three rounds. It is no big deal to finish quest one and two in one round - with Legolas. You just quest well and then let Legie kill a bastard to get additional 2 progress tokens which is all that is required for Fork in the Road.

What heroes did you two chose?

Potentially you could beat Scenario 1 in a single turn. 

You have a Leadership plater and a Spirit/Tactics player with the Leadership player being first player.

The Spirit deck plays Wandering Took. Leadership plays Snowbourn Scout. 

You quest with Eowyn [4+2],  Eleanor [1], Aragorn [2], Gloin [2], Theodred [1] and Wandering Took [1]. You draw Black Forest Bats and Caught in a Web. Wandering Took is removed from the story and you web Theodred. You have 12 willpower against 4 threat strength which gives you 8 progress and completes the first stage of the quest. 

You travel to the Old Forest Road and ready Aragorn. Then the Spirit/Tactics player optionally engages the Black Forest Bats and then plays Quick Strike to kill it with Legolas which gains 2 progress and completes the second stage of the quest. 

Don't Leave the Path is revealed and Ungoliant's Spawn and another Forest Spider is revealed. The Spirit/Tactics character gives control of the Wandering Took to the Leadership player and then engagement checks begin. The Leadership player gets all three Spiders because of their new threat of 32. The Snowbourn Scout defends against the Spawn and the two Forest Spiders are left undefended dealing 3 damage to both Theodred and Gloin. Then the Leadership player plays Sneak Attack to bring Gandalf into play which deals 4 damage to the Spawn. Aragorn and Gandalf attack the Spawn for another 5 damage which kills it.

Theoretical First Turn Victory!

 Nice example! The threshold of 2 on the second quest seems to be the key.

Glorfindel, Beravor, Legolas on one hand and Dunhere, Aragorn, Theodred on the other.
