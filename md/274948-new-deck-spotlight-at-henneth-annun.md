Great deck! I'll definitely use it instead of the more combo-y Noldorian deck that's out there. I love your version because it looks both powerful AND thematic–the perfect combination for me :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

As I can see you're a pretty good deck builder, any chance you could build a powerful and thematic Hobbit deck? Thanks a lot! :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

If you like Hobbits I would recommend this one: http://www.ringsdb.com/decklist/view/8389/requiem-of-a-green-dragon-1.0 [http://www.ringsdb.com/decklist/view/8389/requiem-of-a-green-dragon-1.0].

thats my personal favorite that I pull out when I want to play the shire-folk. It’s very strong, and I think pretty thematic from the ones I’ve played.

Wow... I beat Flight of the Stormcaller in pure solo the first try with this deck... and winning at stage 4 by destroying the Stormcaller!

This is the Noldor deck I always wanted to build! ?
