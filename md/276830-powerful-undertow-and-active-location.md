Hi. I'm a bit undecided on this. I'm playing "The Drowned Ruins" (Dreamchaser Quest 4), which included the treachery "Powerful Undertow":

When Revealed: You cannot flip the active location this round. If the active location is Underwater [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Search?Trait=Underwater.] , resolve its Forced effect as if it is the end of the quest phase. If there is no Underwater [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Search?Trait=Underwater.] active location, Powerful Undertow gains doomed 3, instead.
 

Do you take the first sentence to mean the current active location, or does it also include a new active location, if you travelled to one in the Travel phase, for example? I actually played the latter in the end (a bit more restrictive, but often I wasn't flipping the new Grotto locations anyway, to allow me time to play allies and attachements).

Curious as to what people think.

All encounter card effects recalculate whenever a new card enters play. For instance, a location revealed after Treacherous Fog will still get the threat boost. I'm assuming this applies to the active location spot as well. However, this does not apply to player cards.

I can see that it seems a bit ambiguous, but I'd be confident in playing it the way you did.

I agree with Wandalf. It create an effect that say "If a location is the active location it can't be flipped" until the end of turn.

About his last sentence it can be ambiguous so I prefer to explain it: a player card with the same text would only affect the current active location.

Thanks all, for the replies.

I was unsure because the normal language ("Until the end of the round / phase") wasn't used here, and obviously the effect had to last beyond the end of the phase in order to keep you under water, which I suspect is the main intent of the card  (otherwise you get into the "Until the end of the phase / At the end of the phase" debate).

Fortunately, the impact on a new active location is minor - keeping you on the safe side of the grotto, albeit potentially slowing you down 1 round.

It has the normal language you speak about. This round mean it last until the end of the round. It is a pretty common way to write this kind of effect.
