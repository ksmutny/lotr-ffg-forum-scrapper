1. During setup if the encounter card(s) drawn have no effect are they discarded? Example: During the setup of "an unexpected party" i am to draw one encounter card per player. If this encounter card was "more like a grocer" that reads "when revealed: discard all baggin sphere resources." I would just discard the card as i have no resources yet so it has no effect.

if this is the case then i easily completed the first challenge by just committing all my heroes. The revealed cards in the quest phase also did nothing or were not applicable.

2. Do i skip any phases on the first turn such as the resources phase?

4. Finally, when i complete a quest by adding all the required progress tokens what are the steps taken to continue to the next quest? is it resolved immediately upon completion or do i wait until the start of the next round? Do any excess will apply to adding progress tokens to the newly revealed quest?

 

Thanks!

treacheries without effect go to discard pile

no - on 1st turn add 1 resource and draw 1 card as usual

resolution is IMMEDIATE as long as the quest does not say that another effect has to be fulfilled …ie. X must be killed….no tokens are carried

so just to clarify, this does count as one card i drew even though it had no effect?
