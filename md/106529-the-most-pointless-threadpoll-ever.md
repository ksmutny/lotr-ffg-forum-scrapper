Soooo..... What colour should the next cycle packs be? :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

 

Mirkwood was green, Khazad stone brown, Numenor blue, current cycle is hmm...purple...

 

Does anyone think there is logic there or is it just me? :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] Forest has green, Underground has stone, and for some reason I associate purple with sorcery and magic...

 

I will add colours as I get them...

 

my vote goes for .... grey :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

Ps - see...I said I would do another poll...I bet no one though it would be at this level of crapiness though :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

grey - 1

black - 3

red- 5

white - 1

pink - 1

orange - 4

yellow - 1

Oh, I've missed these polls :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I think red should be next. I have no basis for this theory, but I'd just like to see it!

I don't care for colour, but I wanna have glitter and sprinkles and some shiny-wimy stuff

There is a scientific term for that and it is a normal human thing. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apophenia] :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

But as for the poll, I'd say red.

Light brown, Sands of the South. There you go, I even gave you a shade and a cycle name. Can't go passed some good alliteration.

Numenor is blue? Why not white?

I use different color sleevers for different encounter cards from different cycles.So they won't mixed.

If we're going east next cycle, probably red/orange. If instead we're going north to Eriador and the lost kingdom of Arnor, dark blue.

hah, nice... Here's for a cycle in the desert regions of the Harad and... orange packs.

I want to say red because it's the most prominent primary color they haven't already used but red is also kind if their main color for evil like the eye of Sauron and nightmare packs.

Orange!

Right Pharmboys, totally right... I really don't like that, red is too specific for the general nightmare card... doesn't look good in the forest ones. I always thought it should have been black. But anyway, that sucks, I really wanted to see the Black Serpent on Scarlet cycle with red packs.

Orange. Like treasures. Around noldors or rohans theme.

Yellow/baige. Like wheat from the Shire :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] great poll

White if we go to Forochel, Light Brown/Orange if we go to Harad, or Dark Blue if they finally get the rights and we go hunt for the Ithryn Luin.

I was thinking an orange or yellow but of the choices: red!

## 22 [gman707 on May 20, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/106529-the-most-pointless-threadpoll-ever/?do=findComment&comment=1090759)

Red or yellow seems logical. They tend to be earth tones...baring the purple.

cool answers , thanks for taking part (I had a fear no one would even bother with such pointlessness ...) so, I guess red is the favourite :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] you blood thirsty villians you all! :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

First post in a long while from me, I'd say red or orange (for a change from what's been done), but I'd find black/gray to be much more likely (even if gray would more or less remove any sort of contrast from the boxes.

As to orange, the saga boxes for the hobbit were a rather Rusty Orange, no?
