Are you sure that is the Blue Wizards?  Looks like a snowy environment, not the heat I would have expected.

 

Great picture in any event.

Nice pic, but it's really old and I'm pretty sure it's unrelated to the game. I remember seeing it and considering it when making my Blue Wizards custom cards years ago.

I don't see an FFG print. Also, one of them holds a blue spirit in a shape of naked woman. I doubt that would happen on any official LotR LCG card.

Kind of looks like concept art for a Halo game set in caveman times.
