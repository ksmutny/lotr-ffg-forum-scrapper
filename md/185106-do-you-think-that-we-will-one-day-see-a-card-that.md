... cancels Forced effects on encounter cards?

I don't think so. Forced effects vary a huge bunch, I can only assume that we will see cancelments of some stuff that can happen. Like we already have cancelment of damage, which might as well be an encounter forced effect.

No. If they want to do that they just make the effect "When revealed".

No. Cornerstone of the game, that's why we have 'when revealed' effects.

I'd be much more excited to see a surge cancellation card. Make it something expensive or of limited use, just not quite as limited as the Lampwright.

Never. This would circumvent the core mechanic of many scenarios. The only way to make such an effect without breaking the game would be to give it multiple limitations (e.g. non-unique, non-quest cards, etc.).
