Hi guys,

 I recently made my way to Khazad Dum, as I started playing in late December and I'd like to bring an old query of mine to light. Does Eleanor's cancelling ability trigger on Enemy cards with "When Revealed" effects such as Ungoliant Spawn or Forest Spider also? Because in the rulebook it says that her ability is to cancel "when revealed effects of a treachery card". For myself I have changed the way of playing it from yes to no. But is this right or am I just torturing myself without reason?

As per her own card text, only When Revealed from Treacheries. A Test of Will is needed for Enemies and Locations.

A ha!  Just as I thought. It was a detail that I hadn't noticed from the beginning. Thanks!
