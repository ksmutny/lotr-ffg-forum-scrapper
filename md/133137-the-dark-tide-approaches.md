So does that mean the other two heroes aren't Gimli and Legolas?  Maybe we will get a new Theoden after all.

I always look forward to the saga expansions and they never fail to dissapoint me.

So there have been no Hero versions of Legolas or Gimli since the Core Set, and now there is not even the hope of them on the horizon.

Hey FFG, I would actually like to play as my favourite characters one day in a sphere other then tactics. The three hunters are one of my favourite aspects of the story and still the only way to make a deck is to have 32 starting threat and double tactics. My patience with this game is wearing out.

## 5 [lecudas on January 26, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/133137-the-dark-tide-approaches/?do=findComment&comment=1422224)

I did NOT expect that! Nice twist, and very powerful allies. Gimli will be great for questing AND attacking/defending the same round... And with Cram or UC he can manage some serious action. Also nice with card draw for Tactics curtesy of Legolas!

## 6 [gandalfDK on January 26, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/133137-the-dark-tide-approaches/?do=findComment&comment=1422228)

Gimli-> Awesome! Right sphere (to get the resources to play him), great stats an Awesome ability. Just splendid!

Don't really like his fave and hair though. His axe and armor looks cool but the face could've been better. Great ally!

Legolas-> Cool! Stays in Tactics, but provides a great ability for Tactics to draw cards. This is only the second (?) way for the sphere to draw cards. I would have prefered a whopping 4 attack or 3 cost, because I think, in comparison to Gimli, he is a bit weaker. (although the ability is arguably better) His art is a bit strane but cool lookking. His hair is not blond, great! But the things flying around block the 'view' a bit.

The mechanics of this particular quest do seem tense man! Choosing between +1 def, raising threat by gor or 4 threat in staging area, wow. Never really faced such choiches before.

The Defense keyword seems tto be the thing that says: Enemies 'quest'. I hoped they would count our willpower as a sort of threat, tgus not having to exhaust, but it doesn't seem.to be that way.

I'm excited for this one!

sadly they attach to heroes. You could use Spare Hood and Cloak or Ever Vigilant though.

While I was initially suspecting new versions of Merry and Pippin as heroes of this saga, this new article planted some doubt in me. Yes, two main candidates for hero slots have been ruled out, but if they want heroes of this box to support theme - it doubtly will be another version of two hobbits... unless the other 2 quests involve them very much.

This Gimli is not a hero.

Looking past the player cards for a second, the quest looks amazing and totally unique!  They really keep hitting it out of the park with these saga boxes.

## 10 [Olorin93 on January 26, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/133137-the-dark-tide-approaches/?do=findComment&comment=1422252)

This looks great all-round! Gimli's ability is similar to Wingfoot - if you need him to take on a new enemy, he'll always be ready! Very curious about these quest mechanics. Hoping for a new Theoden hero!

## 11 [Teamjimby on January 26, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/133137-the-dark-tide-approaches/?do=findComment&comment=1422268)

Just noticed this quote in the article:

"In a period of several weeks, we’ll be able to stand atop the walls of Helm’s Deep, alongside Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, and Théoden."

 

I'm 99% sure we're getting a new Theoden hero.  Also, they gave ToS the same estimate that they gave Lost Realm - "several weeks".

I am really glad we got ally versions rather than hero versions.  (It is too much to hope for both.)  I really wanted ally versions for The Road Darkens so now I get to go back with them.  Now if we could just get ally versions of the hobbitses...

## 13 [Gizlivadi on January 26, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/133137-the-dark-tide-approaches/?do=findComment&comment=1422297)

Wow... I'm kinda speechless. I could have sworn we would get new Legolas and Gimli heroes, but IMO the idea to include them as allies is even better! And they're incredible allies, by the way. They'll go directly into my Elladan&Elrohir deck. Amazing allies both of them, and this gives me hope we'll get a new Theoden hero (especially since they mention him by name in the article).

 

As for the quest itself, it's strange that they didn't explain the quest mechanic with enough detail. If I'm not mistaken, the staging area quests against our characters' with its threat, but as the article mentions, locations are gonna be a problem. You have to get rid of them in order to not get location locked, but the effects when they are explored seem pretty harsh... Anyway, great preview, here's waiting to get the expansion as soon as possible!

## 14 [Gizlivadi on January 26, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/133137-the-dark-tide-approaches/?do=findComment&comment=1422305)

Also, Gimli will be just insane in Leadership dwarf decks. Amazing!

Ah, yes... Of course. I am so used to putting UC on Gimli that I got a little too enthusiastic!  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Good idea regarding Spare Hood and Cloak or Ever Vigilant though.

Great allies, both of them. Gimli is just great in 3-4 player games.

I really thought they were a given as the 2 upcoming heroes tho.

Anyone smelling a treebeard hero coming up???

Or maybe new versions of merry & pippin....I said maybe...

Wow, it has been a long time since I've been as excited as I am right now! Legolas and Gimli as allies came a bit as a shock, but they really nailed them! Like them a lot. And now I truly wonder what the heroes will be. Theoden is my first bet now.

 

And the quests seems awesome. I like how encounter deck will be putting progress onto the quest now.

 

 

So, does anyone wonder what the Defense keyword means on the quest card 4B? 

## 20 [Bullroarer Took on January 26, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/133137-the-dark-tide-approaches/?do=findComment&comment=1422401)

I was so expecting hero versions that when I liked at them I thought "Four threat? Why so low?"

It would have been neat for them to have an additional ability like "After Gimli is played from your hand you may search your deck for a copy of Legolas and add it to your hand. If you do shuffle your deck."

## 21 [Gizlivadi on January 26, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/133137-the-dark-tide-approaches/?do=findComment&comment=1422403)

First stage also has this keyword, and I think all of them will have it. It seems this keyword means that the staging area will be placing progress and all this mechanic.

Bit surprised they did not come as heroes in this set, so i wonder what we'll see. Arwen?

If you want to quit the game for the sole reason that you are unable to construct one very specific deck, that's your perogative.

 

My first reaction was exactly the opposite. I was excited, because with these allies it will actually be possible to play with just two decks and have all nine members of the fellowship on the board as either heroes or allies. For that matter, these allies make constructing a single deck which includes the three hunters possible too.

Hmmm... Interesting. So, Leadership Theoden seems like a good chance, but what about the other? Another Eomer? It can't be another Erkenbrand. And speaking of him, I didn't see anything regarding his and Gandalf's arrival in the quest??? They're just cutting that part out? So many questions!

I've started modifying your original decks with the inclusion of Gimli, Legolas and Boromir.  Pippen and Merry with have to be virtual baggage for now.  Would love to see your versions though!

I was actually pretty disappointed to see that Gimli and Legolas are appearing as allies instead of heroes in this set. I was looking forward to having alternative spheres for these beloved heroes and the first half of The Two Towers is a the most natural place to do it.

I'm also a little sad to see that Legolas doesn't have an "enters play" effect--seems like a bit of a missed opportunity to strengthen Silvan synergy in tactics, which could use it IMO.

All that said, they look like great ally cards and I'm definitely looking forward to using them.

## 30 [Glaurung on January 27, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/133137-the-dark-tide-approaches/?do=findComment&comment=1422997)

Legolas just amazing. He is very good additional fot Silvan decks. Draw caed that what tactics always needed

## 31 [PsychoRocka on January 27, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/133137-the-dark-tide-approaches/?do=findComment&comment=1423192)

Ever since my decision to remove Legolas and replace him with Celeborn I have been hoping that we get ally versions of Legolas and Gimli instead of new heroes. This has massively paid off as the Legolas ally is not only amazing as well as very powerful and obviously thematic in my elven decks but also has the Silvan trait so can have his cost reduced by O Lorien and has 4 attack instead of 3 the turn he is played so long as you run Celeborn. If you run Galadriel (which I don't) AND Celeborn he can quest for 2 and then attack for 4 and draw you a card the first turn he is in play. Lastly whilst you would almost always ideally return a Naith Guide or Galadhon Archer to hand to use Feigned Voices or Pursuing the Enemy Legolas can provide a good back up option if you desperately need to use either event.

 

Now that I think about it he's actually a pretty good target for sneak attack as well as you can sneak attack him during player attacks, he still goes up to 4 attack from Celeborn, destroys an enemy, draws you a card and returns to hand ready to be played at 4 attack strength again. Not bad at all considering how few targets there are for sneak attack that actually work well.

Also just want to say I REALLY love the art on Legolas, same artist as the Haldir hero which I think also has incredible art.

Going to be running proxies of Legolas ally tonight and will report my experience

## 33 [Authraw on January 27, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/133137-the-dark-tide-approaches/?do=findComment&comment=1423251)

So now that we know that Legolas and Gimli aren't the heroes, I've been trying to figure out who the new heroes could possibly be.

It could well be Merry and Pippin, but I'm still hoping to get copies of those two with the Rohan and Gondor traits, which makes more sense to go in one of the Return of the King boxes. Plus, I'm not sure I need 3 different Pippin heroes before we get some other important heroes (ahem Arwen) first. I'm hoping they show up as allies here.

Treebeard and Erkenbrand seem like logical choices, given their pivotal roles in the battles of Isengard and Helm's Deep, respectively. But the antlered crown just gave us both of these cards, so that makes me feel like they were making up for a decision to cut them from this box. We don't really need second copies of these characters yet; we've barely had a chance to play with the copies we just got.

So who else shows up in the first half of the Two Towers? Quickbeam? But it would seem strange to get a Quickbeam hero before Treebeard. We don't have Gamling or Grimbold yet, and they're both present at the battle of Helm's Deep, so it could be them. Maybe we'll get a "Battle of the Fords of Isen" quest, then they'd be obvious choices. Hama dies during the battle for Helm's Deep, maybe it's his turn for a new hero. I think Elfhelm was present too.

But honestly, it feels strange to think of FFG shipping a deluxe set featuring bit characters as the heroes. In that case, Theoden and Eomer are really the best choices once Gimli and Legolas (and Aragorn) are out. I'm still having fun with the Theoden and Eomer that we have, but I suppose I wouldn't mind a fresh coat of paint on them.

Thoughts? Am I overlooking someone?

This!

I had to look for some time before realising they are allies. At first I was like, what kind of card is this... Totally feel you.

## 36 [MyNeighbourTrololo on January 27, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/133137-the-dark-tide-approaches/?do=findComment&comment=1423458)

Well, I don't know how you can mistake an ally for a hero. The most distinctive part is the cost/threat cost, and it differs dramatically in it's visualisaiton and is situated at the top of the card (the part you're usually start looking at it).

> What you think is the reason of ,,Players cannot   reduce their  threat." of 5B?

 

Being unable to reduce threat in the final quest stage further depicts the desperation of the battle. It's the moment during the darkest hour of the battle where Rohan rides out against the host of Isengard. This is not the time to be greeted by the galadhrim, counseled by elrond, or whatever means you we have to reduce threat.

 

 

On to quest mechanics, it seems that the players' goal is get to quest stage 5 as fast as possible. The only way to do this it to put eight resources of The Defense of Helm's Deep. That's eight rounds of what should be grueling combat. I'm curious to know if there are encounter card effects that add or remove resources from this card.

It's incredibly unlikely, as we only just got the first hero version, but...Gandalf the white?

So, why do you think its impossible to get a Leggy and Gimli hero still? It could be a nice bluff of the article.

And in addition, the legolas hero could synergize with the Gimli ally and the other way around. 

Ok not very possible, but still nice twist...

I am thinking we might only get one hero:  Erkenbrand.  If we get another it will probably be a second Eomer or Théoden.

 

I am now wondering if we will also get Merry and Pippen allies.

I would say that merry and pippin are more likely to come in the next expansion.  Gandalf the white is also more likely in next saga.  It would be a bit strange to come out with another Erkenbrand, just a few months after the latest one.  Eomer is more likely.  I honestly wouldn't be to surprised if Hama came up again.   Also, something that was not mentioned is the fact that since we had Mablung (assuming that it is not the mablung of the 1st age, the Faramirs warrior) it wouldn't be too unreasonable to have Damrod.  He might just be an ally but it would be cool to have him as a hero.  Another thing is that it might not be too strange for Eowyn to show up since she hasn't been a hero since the core. Final thing that would be cool to show up in the saga (not necessarily this one, just one of the future) would be Frodo.  maybe even as an ally but that might not be thematic...

I don't think we'll get a Gandalf the White, just the opportunity to resurrect a hero killed by the Balrog.

 

(But then I didn't think we'd get a Gandalf the Gray either.)

## 44 [gandalfDK on January 27, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/133137-the-dark-tide-approaches/?do=findComment&comment=1424188)

They havr to mention Gandalfs return. It too big of a deal to simply ignore it. But as a matter of fact, we have never been given any version of Gandalf, Grey or White. Just Gandalf. That is a distiction that you shouldn't overlook. I don't think they ever adress his certain 'states' specificly, but maybe a Boon or attachment.

We certaibly won't get Erkenbrand. That would be really strange, seen the timeframe.

I hope for Theoden King to make a reappearance. Also Gamlimg would be cool!

My reaction ws exactly the same! I really like the ally versions, though I was hopling for new hero versions as well. Their treats will make their respective decks (dwarven and silvan) go even more bonkers. The card gain from legolas is particularly awesome for tactics.

## 47 [Kcall07 on January 28, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/133137-the-dark-tide-approaches/?do=findComment&comment=1424862)

I still find not giving the Hero slots to Legolas and Gimli a curious choice.

We've only just had Gandalf, Treebeard and Erkenbrand, we got the two hobbits in the Black Riders (and there's already a second version of Pippin), Theoden was at the end of the Against the Shadow cycle. But Legolas and Gimli?! Two of the most prominent characters in the entire story are neglected since the core set? For nearly four years!

Yes, the existing versions hold up well, but I want new options to play these characters! Not just allies who take time to draw and pay for, and may not show up at all in a single game.

And as for the possible inclusion of more obscure characters as Heroes in this box, believe me, I want every tiny detail of Middle Earth represented too, but not at the expense of the feel of the core story. For me, regular expansion packs are the place to do this. I prefer the Sagas to stick as closely as possible to the book. I'll admit I would be glad to see another version of Eowyn, depicting her skills in battle, but isn't the fifth saga box a better place to do this?

Is no one else mystified or disappointed by this choice?

I think it will be some efects that remove resources  from  The Defense of Helm’s Deep [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/ffg_content/lotr-lcg/treason-of-saruman/the-defense-of-helms-deep.png] !

Maybe something as:

A long night of fighting

Treachery

When Revealed:Remove each resource from The Defense of Helm’s Deep [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/ffg_content/lotr-lcg/treason-of-saruman/the-defense-of-helms-deep.png].If there is at least one enemy in play,shuffle A long night of fighting back into encounter deck.

It is useful to realize what has been said (or guessed) before and what this article proves: the designers consider people might play this having only the LotR saga and the core set. Thus it would make little sense to have second hero versions of Legolas and Gimli when you get them in the core set: having two "useless" cards among four boxes only. In a similar way, it would make even less sense to get new hero versions of Merry and Pippin because we got them with the Black Riders. Théoden and Éomer, or even Erkebrand, are different stories. They do not care Éomer and Théoden have "only" been out for about a year because they came out with the cycles. Thus, we may surely expect hero Théoden, and probably a hero Éomer, though a hero Treebeard would also make sense. I do not think we will see more allies, as we also only got two in Black Riders, but this is far less certain.

As for Éowyn, I would like to see Dernhelm as follows:

 

Tactics Attachment

Cost 1

Attach to Éowyn

Éowyn gains Tactics icon

Planning Action: "Exhaust Dernhelm to give Éowyn +3 Attack and -3 Willpower untill the end of the round."

> Is no one else mystified or disappointed by this choice?

Sure, i was a bit disappointed, but I also wanted more of the fellowship represented as allies. So, I'm alright with it, although my play style leans more towards loading heroes with attachments rather than ally swarm. So, the new allies might only find there place in a few of my decks, especially theme decks.

I assume we'll see new hero versions of legolas and gimili. I thought now would have been the most logical choice, but i have given up trying to predict what cards we will see and when. I guess it all makes sense to the designers in their long term plans for the game.

I've resigned to accepting what player cards we get. At this point, all they do is add a variety of ways to beat scenarios, since many scenarios can be beaten with cards we got back in the Dwarodelf cycle. My main interest lies in the new scenarios, and hope they provide good challenges.

I agree and don't think we'll get a new Erkenbrand, but: we went through a very similar situation with the two Pippins in Encounter at Amon Din (July 2013) and The Black Riders (September 2013) -- 2 months apart.  So, strange, but not without precedent.

Seems to me that they should have incorporated the Battle (quest 5b) and the Siege (1 to 4 quests) keywords on the quest...

 

Or does they create some keywords and then just forget them?

Well, I too like getting Fellowship allies but these ones aren't that great. They really don't have any synergy, any two allies who have Ranged and Sentinel "work together" and they don't have any theme when compared to Boromir ally. Instead they are just useful allies that are expensive and have a strong ability but really don't feel like Gimli and Legolas so I would have much preferred hero versions of them. I just think they missed the mark a little on these two.

No, they don't. The thing they did with Helm's deep provides gameplay. All Battle and Siege does is swaps wp for at or def. Countered too easily if built for.

Well put! This captures how I feel pretty well too. There was lot of room for the mechanics to reinforce the theme with these two, but what we got ends up just feeling like they wanted to make a few "power cards".

I guess that means that they'll see a lot of play, though, which might be fitting enough on its own. They are great cards.

All these negative comments are completely unwarranted in my opinion. First of all, these allies were meant to be really good general purpose allies. Remember that this game is based more on the spheres rather than traits or specific themes, so these two allies were meant to be just good and splashable in multiple decks, kinda like ally Faramir, Arwen, etc. So why is this so surprising? We get these type of allies all the time. And regarding theme, I think these allies have great theme. No weird gimmicks, just a simple yet effective ability that captures the main trait of the character perfectly. Gimli is a dauntless and enduring warrior, so when an enemy comes up instead of being demoralized he readies. Legolas on the other hand is a deadly and far-seeing elven archer, so he gathers information when killing enemies. These are pretty much perfect abilities. Simple and elemental, which I personally prefer.

Couldn't agree more with Gizvaldi. To me they are both thematic and very useful/powerful. Not every card needs to be as intricate and unique as Haldir (hero), Galadriel (hero) or Gandalf (hero).

Just sharing my opinion to get some discussion, no need to get all upset. Is it really that negative of a comment or just a compliment to such amazing cards before and pointing out how the article (if you actually read it) is a little misleading for these allies? It's in the context of them competing for kills so I was thinking these ally versions would represent that but instead they represent as you said the powerful characters they are in general. They are great allies which will be fun to build decks around but are kind of generic which is all I was a little disappointed about.

We already have a competing for kills in this game, and it didn't worked out that well.

 

A good generic card is what this game needs sometimes. I'd rather enjoy a good generic card that I can use a lot than a bad complex card that I can hardly use at all.

+1

 

As a side note, while MV's art on Legolas in both his hero version and on Hands Upon is perfect, his depiction as left-handed does not sit well with me. I think it's quite possible that FFG reverses the images so that they look better in the printed cards (I have no other explanation why so many characters are depicted left-handed), I judge what I see nonetheless.

Grace is one thing, ambidexterity another. Other than that, the thing is that not only Elves, but a great number of members of other races as well are depicted as left-handed in a proportion that simply does not make sense. As to why it matters to me, it doesn't. It's just what I previously wrote: it doesn't make sense. Even though the setting is a fantasy one and anything can happen, almost half of the heroes being left handed baffles me.

Yeah, the left-handed thing puzzles me also. At one point it seemed like all of them were lefties for whatever reason. I thought there might be a thing to it actually, like an art-designing superstition or something.

 

As for being ambidextrous, Maedhros would be a better example for the thought above.

Hahaha this left handedness talk is funny, I too have noticed this on several of the cards but never thought that much about it. Being able to wield your weapon with both hands however is an important tactical skill it seems especially if one arm gets wounded (or tired) which seems likely.

Sorry, but what indicates that Legolas is portrayed as left-handed on his hero card or Hands Upon the Bow? The fact that he holds the bow in his right? I'm left-handed but I'm a right-handed shot with bows and guns. To me it makes more sense to use your dominant hand to aim. He can probably aim with either hand, though - he's had time to practise.

 

As far as left-handedness goes in ME in general, 1) genetics don't necessarily work the same way there; on Earth, about 10-15% of the population is left-handed but in Arda it might be significantly higher and 2) left-handed people are known for exceeding in a wide variety of fields (look at basically anything from renowned artists to fencing champions or US presidents) so to me it's not at all inconceivable that a large number of important characters in ME would be left-handed. Théoden is another good example, at least in the films - and they got that right with the action figure as well.

Think about it this way.  Gleowine costs 2 and lets you draw a card every turn.  Sure, you can let other people draw, but most people use it on themselves.  Unless you are playing solo, you should be able to trigger Legolas's ability every turn.  So if you deduct the 2 cost from Legolas, you have a guy with 1/3/1/3 stats and ranged for a cost of 2.

I respectfully disagree.  I often play low-cost Tactics as a primary or secondary sphere and it's extremely effective, but the one problem I routinely run into is poor card draw.  Foe Hammer is amazing, but useless if you don't have a weapon attached yet.  I'd easily include Legolas ally.  Besides the ways to circumvent or reduce his cost as a Silvan, repeatable card draw for Tactics is HUGE.  And pair him with Merry to get repeatable readying.

## 84 [monkeyrama on January 30, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/133137-the-dark-tide-approaches/?do=findComment&comment=1428043)

Imagine if that ability was on a hero. At 9 threat, I would kill for that ability.

 

Ah, puns.

 

But, seriously, seems like a **** nice ability for an ally, even at 4 cost. Repeatable, and part of what you'd have him in play for anyway.

My Tactics/Leadership deck uses resource acceleration to help pay for expensive Tactics cards. Other than King Under the Mountain (with a Dwarf hero), card draw is the biggest weakness for this strategy. Having a 3 Attack ally with ranged that allows me to draw cards is an absolute perfect fit for the deck. I am mystified that repeatable card draw on a Tactics ally could ever be considered weak. With those stats, what else would you be doing with him? Off the top of my head, I can't think of another ranged ally with 3 printed attack - Legolas is a beast. If you consider just how effective he will be when Celeborn is on the table, it gets silly. Also, Rumil and Legolas are going to be so much fun to pair together.

You can even attach Rivendell Blade on Legolas, and almost counts as an extra hero, as long as you don't block with him. 

 

Also, as a big Leadership fan, I think Gimli is as good as Legolas is in Leadership decks. He costs 4, which with Leadership is always affordable if you use Steward or a Thorin dwarf deck, can quest and attack in the same round for 2 (or 3 if using Dain, which is the best case scenario for this ally). That's pretty **** good, no reason not to add at least 1 copy.

The new legolas ally is a really beast. But by other way, you have to forget his heroe version, when is the best tactcis hero for me.

True, but Legolas is infinitely more replaceable than other heroes, such as Glorfindel, that you might include in a deck.

I think it's quite possible that FFG reverses the images so that they look better in the printed cards (I have no other explanation why so many characters are depicted left-handed), I judge what I see nonetheless.

I'm left-handed but I'm a right-handed shot with bows and guns. To me it makes more sense to use your dominant hand to aim. He can probably aim with either hand, though - he's had time to practise.

 

So, you 're telling me that, though left-handed, you pull the string with your weak hand... What bow have you been using? Something like this [http://mlm-s1-p.mlstatic.com/3743-MLM49963737_4520-O.jpg] I guess...

 

The dominant hand is always used to pull the string, not hold the bow. It takes significant effort and strong muscles to pull the string. Archery is not for everyone. Requires strength.

Holding bow with left hand=You are right hand dominant. I couldn't be more right handed, and hold a bow in my left hand and pull back with my stronger and more dextrous right hand.

I will say however that any great archer can/should be able to use both.

The way I learned it, you go by the dominant eye. You need strength in both arms anyway...

 

And on topic, does anyone expect an aragorn hero at some point?

Yes we need about 3 more of those! (oh wait-- 2 incoming!!)

Is there really a discussion as to whether or not an immortal super archer could shoot with both using both his left and right hand when there are people living today who can? Lol.

So I rebuilt my decks for The Road Darkens using the two new allies and have played out the first two quests.  I was able to beat them both this way, including having Gandalf take the plunge with the balrog.  It was really satisfying to have the entire fellowship out on the table and battling their way through Moria.  I'm really glad we got the two allies.

I'm quite excited to give the new ally versions a go in my hobbit deck. I am using Elf-stones to play more expensive allies anyway, and Legolas combos well with Merry, and Gimli gives some flexible beef to support in a variety of areas.

Perhaps these ally versions of Legolas and Gimli give more hope that there will one day be an Aragorn ally.

I for one really hope we do get one in the saga expansions, perhaps the second last one.

I'm not too upset with them being Allies as that opens possibilities on newer heroes and maybe that new Theoden everyone is hoping will come out someday.
