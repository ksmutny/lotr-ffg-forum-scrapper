Just want to check....

I assume that if a character has an effect triggered by exhausting then it has to exhaust SOLEY to use that ability, i.e. it cannot exhaused to defend AND claim the effect, eg Daughters of Nimrodol.

 

Pretty sure that's the case, but can you confirm?

 

Thanks

Phil

yes that is correct.

however- if something says 'after X exhausts' it would be ok. it depends on the text.

for example arwen can exhaust to defend and trigger her ability
