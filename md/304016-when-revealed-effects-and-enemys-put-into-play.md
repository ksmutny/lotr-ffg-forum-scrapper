Do you resolve the When Revealed Effects of enemies that are put into play engaged with you by treachery cards?

If the treachery card doesn't mention "reveal" then no, the When Revealed effect won't trigger.

Okay.  I know when you take a card from the discard pile and add it to the staging area you do resolve the when revealed effects even though it does not mention reveal.  I was just wondering if this worked the same way.

This is incorrect. Adding to the staging area does not trigger anything directly related to revealing.
