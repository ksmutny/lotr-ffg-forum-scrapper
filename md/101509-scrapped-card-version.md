# [Scrapped card version](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101509-scrapped-card-version/)

## 1 [MyNeighbourTrololo on March 17, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101509-scrapped-card-version/?do=findComment&comment=1015212)

Some time ago, I stumbled upon the image of enemy card which was some evil spirit of the mirkwood. It had same stats and text as some of the existing enemy cards in the core set (most probably bats, but I don't remember for sure). I was foolish enough not to save the image and now I'm desperate - I've searched all over the internet and can't find it. Does anybody happen to possess the whereabouts of this image or anything of simmiliar interest? (like Marsh Adder with "Stealth" keyword, or Thorin who spends his damage tokens as resources)

you probably are not searching for this, but just to be sure, I will post it here.

Nope, the time I found the card I was talking about was prior to announcement even of Voice of Isengard.

 

Here some examples of old outdated cards:

You can see him on this photo, near Aragorn.

I think it was called Mirkwood Wight...

Oh yeah, finally found him!

Here you can see Wight himself, as well as Ungoloian Spawn having art of Caught in the Web.

And here we can see that Snowbourn Scout was previously a Rider of Rohan and had a paid ability to add progress to the locations, Gloin were Thorin (with a weaker version of his ability), and Valiant Sacrifice had far neater from my point of view art.

interesting, thanks for finding these! Original Aragorn had 3 willpower and always didn't have to exhaust to commit to quests!

> interesting, thanks for finding these! Original Aragorn had 3 willpower and always didn't have to exhaust to commit to quests!

His stats were the same, they just printed attack at the top (which looks totally weird now)...but the ability is awesome!  Spirfindel before Spirfindel.

Also, Thorin=Gloin.  Glad they changed him out and we got a better, more thematically appropriate version.

That's right, I forgot that they did that.

very cool to see, would have been a popular option to include Thorin in the core; but I think they have to like their decision to be patient and release him in the fitting saga expansions

Really interesting to see some decisions had been made at the very end. Aragorn would have been too strong, surely, especially in the core set times. Even with the shaft, I think he was the favourite core hero, without it, he would have been for everyone. I also remember Gandalf, he had actually been much worse. The cost was six and the response could only be triggered when played from hand, so Sneak Attack would have been useless for that. The only positive difference was that he got rid of an enemy right away - which would not have lasted long till errata, anyway.

## 12 [MyNeighbourTrololo on March 19, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101509-scrapped-card-version/?do=findComment&comment=1017870)

Well, of all, I still think that Gandalf should be errata'd to the "When you play Gandalf from your hand" because it's just borderline overpowered and kills gameplay of the sneak attack. 

## 13 [lleimmoen on March 19, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101509-scrapped-card-version/?do=findComment&comment=1017882)

Could be. It is still a great difference in the games with my Gondor deck whether I get Sneaky Gandalf or not. If the response were only after playing from hand, two things would probably happen: Hobbit Gandalf would be much more prominent version, and more trials Sneak Attacking with other allies (but the options there are not so great still).

## 14 [Glaurung on March 19, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101509-scrapped-card-version/?do=findComment&comment=1018025)

I do believe if Gandalf will get this errata we will see much more interesting deck building around.

I think those two would be balanced. Because core Gandalf brings big boost with him despite being one-rounder, while hobbit Gandalf is lingering but not all can handle the threat. Right now, I'tll be luck if hobbit Gandalf is used at least 10% of the times core one is used.

As for the sneak attack(would core Gandalf get erratad), think of it: You get any character from your hand on your side for the entire phase by paying just 1 resource (which can be refunded if you happen to possess Horn of Gondor)! Beorn, Bork Ironfist, Gandalf himself(no goodies on enter, but getting ally with dat stat block for 1 phase by paying 1 resource is still hella useful), Gildor, Landroval(you can combo this with Boromir, btw) and else, else, else. The Sneak Attack would become what it meant to be.

Characters with Discard to effect, like Damrod, could have been included in an out-of-sphere deck just for the purpose of sneak attack. Thing would be more interesting without Gandalf-Sneak Attack leadership no-brainer.

You cannot combo Landroval with Tactics Boromir, if you mean the discard action, discard does not mean destroy.

Otherwise, I do agree, finding new tricks for Sneak Attack, or any card for that matter, is a good thing. It is exactly why I was happy when Stand and Fight became unable to bring Gandalf back.

As for Gandalf (core) vs. Gandalf (Hobbit), my experience is far from such imbalance. The latter can be so effective, the threat prize is not that terrible for many a deck, or even quicker quests, and it gets better if you can find a way to overcome the resource cost (Elf-stone, Vilya).

Ok, lack of precise wording knowledge regarding Landroval on my part here... Thought it was "leaves play". Regardless, if you about to lose a hero, you can sneak attack with Landroval to prevent this loss. For just 1 leadershit resource.

Sneak attack is action so you cannot prevent it instantly but if you predict the combat will end by dead or some other way hero will die you can play sneak in action window to be ready for future dead in this phase…...

That's exactly what I meant.
