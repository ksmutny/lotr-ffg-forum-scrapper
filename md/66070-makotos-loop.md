# [Makoto&#039;s Loop](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/66070-makotos-loop/)

 I am one of the French Players at the initiative of the community forum : sdajce.forumactif.org

One of our fellow players (Makoto is his name)  discovered a loop that sounds really powerful and i'd like to know how you feel about it and whether it shall cause a clarification in the rules in a near future.

It's rather easy to set it up with the help of Beravor, Unexpected Courage and Imladris Stargazer.

Use and abuse them until you gather the three cards that make the loop possible : Zigil Miner, Grim Resolve and Will of the West.

It's now possible to exhaust zigil Miner for a couple ressources, Beravor for some cards and any number of other characters. Play Grim Resolve to ready them all, then Will of the West to reshuffle every card you discarded into your deck. And…play it again !

The fun part is that provided you have enough time to play it as many times as you need, you may gather as much will as you want and lower your threat level as low as you wish with Elrond's Counsel. Likewise, you may place as many cards as you want from the encounter deck to your victory display with Out of the Wild. It's also interesting to guarantee the return of Gandalf.

So, has Makoto perfectly understood how players are supposed to make the best of their cards ?
Or is there something quite unexpected and undesired about the way they are played ?

 A few things:

Playing Grim Resolve + Will of the West will take 6 resources every time you wish to do it.  That's difficult do more than once in a round, even with Zigil Miner.  There are simply not enough 6-cost cards to feed to Ziggy for you to do this more than a couple of times.

Also: Grim Resolve will not ready Unexpected Courage.

So yes, it's a powerful combo, but it is an extremely expensive combo that requires at least 5 cards to pull off more than once.  I wouldn't call it abusive at all.

As i say already many times Beravur is broken!!! I use to find many crazy combo with her before and there is another one. Even with limit once per turn errata she is still very powerful! In my opinion: she deserve rest and ban.

 Guess playing like this will get boring after two or three games.

For unlimited resources just set up Beravor, Stargazer and 2 Zigis.

5 cards in your deck, none in your discard pile…….Stargazer arranges from top to bottom: Grim Resolve, Will of the West, and of the 3 bottom cards one most be Beorn or Brok. done!

 

And there are some other combos….like exchange one Zigi with a Hobbit Hero and add Good Meal to the mix.

Couldn't agree more.  This sounds like an incredibly dull way of playing.  At least from where I'm sitting anyway
