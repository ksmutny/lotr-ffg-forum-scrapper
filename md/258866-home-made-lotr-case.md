Hi Folks,

Thought I'd post a couple of pictures of my home made case for the LotR LCG.

 * The card sections have a stiff felt on the bottom. Not sure if they're wide enough for sleeved cards (but I don't use sleeves anyway). 
 * There's about 20mm of space in the lid for the rule books etc.
 * It's made from 7mm ply & 3mm MDF with brass hardware.
 * The divider slots were cut using a jig on a table saw.  It makes a laborious task reasonably quick & easy.

Next up is to cut some of the actual dividers, then onto building a 2nd one for the AH LCG.  Hopefully I can learn from my mistakes & improve on this one.

Cheers,

Jim.

I wish I had tenacity to perform such a feat :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Seven Adventure Packs later and here's a quick update on the box...

The left side is as full as the right, now, and adding seven packs worth of character cards has exposed a few issues:

-95mm wide card areas are not wide enough. With the laminated dividers, it’s awfully tight. So I need to move the MDF dividers into the middle of the box by a few mm and give them some more space.

-The cards are rubbing on the front & back of the box. Some additional felt should take care of that.

-The cards are catching on the divider slots. My initial thought was to just scrap the slots, then I remembered I have a sheet of 1mm styrene left over from the old 40k days. So I should be able to cut strips of that to act as a spacer to keep the cards off the divider slots.

Last night I ripped out the dividers. Proving that the glue is stronger than the MDF. A little bit of sanding & paint should fix that.

It looks amazing. Totally something I wish I had.

Awesome!

Totally going to make one now, always complain about the fact that I need storing for my cards.
I have woodwork power tools and enjoy me some DIY from time to time.
Only up to the Ring Maker Cycle in chronological order including the two Hobbit Saga's and my two boxes has limited space left.

I will probably make my version a little broader (width).

Do you have a link for me on those dividers/sorters? 

Very good work.
