Just uploaded all the old forest artwork for anyone who doesn't have it yet and wants to see the art :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] All the card text spoilers are already up on Hall of Beorn card search so I didn't include the 2A stages. Sorry a couple of the pics are a little blurry but Beorn should have perfect spoilers up eventually this is just for the meantime (for those of you who are obsessed with spoilers like me!)

Man, this grasping root should really discard attachments instead of assigning damage with this kind of art :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

No boons/burderns btw? I just don't remember...

Good call!! I actually have that kept seperately with my other campaign pool cards! I'll add it in now!

So, it features no burdens? Kinda a win-win scenario.

Yeah it is just like a bonus quest with no burdens and a boon. You do have to earn the boon by putting 13 damage on Old Man Willow however which isn't easy... he raises threat like crazy.
I believe that Barrow Downs also only has a boon and no burdens but its a one use card for the whole campaign whereas Old Bogey-Stories can be used throughout the whole campaign as an extra mulligan or even mulligan during the game.

I'm sorry to say this, but we already had all picture spoilers for this scenario since Gen Con. COTR posted them on facebook.

no worries, I, for one, have not seen them before, so many thanks for sharing.

 

And yes, the art of the locations is fantastic. Cannot wait to get my hands on the cards and see them first-person. Any ideas when it will be available for purchase in regular distribution?

Should be pretty soon. Most previous Gen Con quests came out in October.
