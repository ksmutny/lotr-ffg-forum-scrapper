I'm planning on running another Saga campaign soon, and I was thinking about how to approach it regarding heroes.
Does anyone know if you can add/remove players from a Saga campaign, like you can in Arkham?
E.g. running two-handed with the fellowship, then after the split having a single hand for the Frodo portion of the quests?
Does the "change heroes" text mean you could drop from two hands to one without penalty?

I believe you are allowed to add/drop players without incurring the penalty. The rules don't have anything on the matter.

As long as you do not add new heroes, you don't incur the threat penalty.

Does adding another player count as adding three heroes?

Technically I would argue that it does. But I would also argue that if you want to add a friend to your campaign you should just do it, and it wouldn't be fun to "punish" them for joining partway.
