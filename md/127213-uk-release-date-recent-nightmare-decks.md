# [UK release date - recent Nightmare decks?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/127213-uk-release-date-recent-nightmare-decks/)

Now before you tell me they are POD, I know, I have bought some from FFG's store but they are horribly expensive. Then I realised that actual UK stores (physical and online) are getting them in and cutting the ridiculous shipping costs.

 

But...

 

I've noticed we are really lagging behind now. I check the lists on Esdevium games every week and though the main releases are coming through, we haven't had a Nightmare deck on there since the third Moria cycle one.

 

So we are missing -

 

The Long Dark

Foundations of Stone

Shadow and Flame

Heirs of Numenor

Old Forest

 

Has anyone seen any of these in UK shops?

No. I was waiting, but eventually resorted to ordering from FFG and suffering the high cost.

You think you're far behind? :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] In Germany we're still stuck at the end of the mirkwood cycle. :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

The same in Spain.

Unfortunately, I got hit with a customs charge, and therefore a ridiculous "handling fee" from the royal mail, making this a very expensive purchase indeed.

If you look at the Esdevium Games website (they provide stock for my FLGS (actually a comic shop but it sells games)) and they put a list up on Saturdays of what is coming out the next Tuesday in the UK. That might be of some help to you.

Thanks Silverthorn, I check it each week. Nothing so far. I've contacted the ebay seller I usually use and they are keeping an eye on it too.

I think the POD stuff comes out at random outside of the US (and possibly there if you're not buying it direct from FFG).

Looks like we might be getting back on track with releases.

Game Trade Magazine is saying the missing Nightmare desks are either being released generally or about to be released.

and for UK people, Esvedium Games is saying LOTR LCG: The Old Forest Saga and LOTR LCG –Heirs of Numenor Nightmare decks will be out this week. The missing Moria ones will soon follow I am guessing, they are listed in GTM mag as 2015.

My patience finally ran out last week - I ordered old forest, long dark, foundations of stone, shadow & flame, on the doorstep, heirs of numenor and finally fog on the barrow downs - via the FFG online shop. It was one of those "ouch" moments...

Really? Holy cow, and I thought I was waiting long for my NM HoN. My condolances...

Well, nothing forbids them from buying english stuff. No one bothers to transale LotR-like games for us here where I live, yet I have full (almost) LotR collection already.

Yes indeed! Stupid neighbours of mine.. Buy English versions! ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] I hate German grammar! (scored a 1,0 on my last 'write a German letter' -test.) There are actually three versions as far as I know, English, German and Chinese. Why the Germans need their own version.. ;P There is no Dutch, no French, no Spanish (way bigger language), No Ukrainian, No Swedish, No Polish, No Russian .... I could go on and on, but the Germans want their own. I don't want to offend anybody, so I won't make any stupid WOII jokes and just wonder why it's taking so long to release German stuff then? Mirkwood cycle was roughly three years ago!
