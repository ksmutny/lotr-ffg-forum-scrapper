Me and my girlfriend used to play the Lord of the Rings LCG all the time about three years ago. Our son was too young to grasp the game at the time, but he is at that age now, so we have been bringing out our collection and playing through it with him.  

 

Our son was able to pick up on Marvel Legendary which gave him some experience with card games that has helped him be able to understand this one, and he asked me why there wasn't a playmat for LOTR like there is for Legendary, so I told him I'd make one--one that can handle two, three or four players.

 

So this is what I came up with. Check it out and let me know if you have any suggestions on how to make it better:

They look beautifully, but I'm not sure how well will they work. I think the approach AHLCG 4 player playmat took could be better, with the encounter deck and quest on the top, and the 4 players on the bottom, 2 on the right and 2 on the left.

Something more like this:  Sin_t_tulo.png [https://s17.postimg.org/4uo9tul1n/Sin_t_tulo.png] [https://postimg.org/image/4uo9tul1n/]

 

Also, where do you picture each players deck and discard pile?
