so what do we think of purchasing singles? ever gonna happen? i remember back in june or so when this came up and someone posted a store link and they had celebrians stone for £6 six quid!!! sorpresa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sorpresa.gif]

anyways i know the only way of selling them is splitting packs/core sets so the store will never make a profit unless theyre ridiculous prices

i mean does the lcg format even allowing for single buying? the whole point of an lcg is that you have the opportunity to buy every card available but the core set is the only pack that didnt incorporate the 3 copies rule

I hope this never happens. This was the downfall of Magic for most gamers. The person with the most $$$ had the best decks. The biggest draw for me to an LCG was that everyone had access to the same cards in the same packs. You don't have to buy one hundred packs to get the rare cards.

I really hope they never start releasing LCG cards singles

This is a fallacy for two simple reasons:

1) The way it is today, if you have more $$ you have access to 3 of every card (by buying the core repeatedly). 

2) There is no such thing as 'the best deck'. This isn't a competitive environment; the best decks are those who make you have more fun. Some people like the Zigil Miner combo, I find it very dull.

 

I don't believe they will sell singles because it was not their intention in the first place. If they repent at some time, it is possible to sell a 'rare pack' with the cards we don't have a 3-of yet, but I still find it'll not happen.

 

 

The game is doing very good and I trust the designers. The only thing I'm still wondering is if they will keep using the first cycle cards and the core for future expansions. I hope they do.

a pay to win game is never good, but i dont think this is possible in this game...the only singles you would really need are just from the core set, thats assuming they keep up with the 3 copies per pack, or dont change a card that allows you to have 4 copies of something, so i was just wondering if youd ever be able to buy those core set rares

I was referring to magic. The person with more $$$ gets the best cards.

I love the LCG format for the reason that everyone has access to the same cards. You buy a pack and you know what you're getting is the same thing everyone else got when they bought it.

Before this game I played MtG and star wars minis. Traded my MTG stuff for SWM figs... love star wars, and i still am an active with the online community despite the game being discontinued, but I just cant find people to play with anymore in real life. Thats why I got into this game, the solo-play was the key selling point. I also saw a LOTR miniatures game (based on hero clicks) and was tempted to get it... but opted for this. Really, I just don't feel like sinking the money into boosters... its too hard to find people in my area to play with to make it a justified purchase. At least with this game i know i'll get my moneys worth of play out of it.

I really detest random boosters and Fantasy flights choice to not use them when theyre such a money sucker makes them one of the most respected companies in my book. Boosters, for me, becomes the art of ebay reselling for a fraction of the value until I finally get fed up and pay a rediculas amount for whatever fanboy obsessed character I'm trying to pull. The current process for this game keeps me spending just as much, but i get exactly what I want. Fantasy flight has my money, I have the cards I want, its a happy family.

yes....and at the same time its a good business strategy because i think alot of players are drawn in because of the reasons you stated. but hey, i dont mind giving them £120 of my money a year....im happy to keep the company thriving and releasing good stuff happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]

Indeed. I know you were talking about MtG. And that's my point. You cannot compare the two.

You said:

"I hope this never happens. This was the downfall of Magic for most gamers. The person with the most $$$ had the best decks."

(emphasis mine)


Again, if "this" happens with LotR LCG, it'll not be it's downfall; far from it. This game has little competitive value; if I spend three thousand dollars in cards or just a couple of dozens to buy the Core the result will be the same. In Magic, if you have more money, you have access to more stuff and therefore can curbstomp all other players; in LotR, if you buy all AP's and the Core while I only have the Core, your broader access to the game is just going to benefit me.

There is no reason why a single-cards pack or something alike would bring doom to this game.

Agreed. I concede the point. Single card releases would not be its downfall. I would be the first in line for them. However, i don't think the game would benefit from single card releases. There are just too many combos of cards that work well together to toss in a single card. Perhaps small releases of cards that would all work together.

you can buy full core sets form ebay for nearly the same price as a brand new AP... so what is the problem?

the amount of useless cards that you get with it

but they are not useless. They allow you to play multiplayer if you have a mate over for example. Also the cheapest place you can find singles is selling for like 8-10 bucks a card for the cards that only get packaged as singles.. .so in fact buying all the key cards in singles costs more than buying a brand new full price core set..

 

I guess as I am a long time player of card games the cheapness of LCGs is just amazing to me that anyone would complain. I sold my Caw-Blade deck b4 the banning of jace for little over 1000 bucks, and that was just 60 second hand cards. Anyone playing a CCG will know that a 40 buck card is common as hell AND you need 4 of them in a deck for MTG.

My biggest wish with this game is that they would release a "player set" that included one or two threat counters and the player cards from the core set.

Not only do I want more copies of some of the core cards (I also wish there had been a minimum of three of each card in the core set), but I also have lots of friends who like this game. However, they only play it when they're over at my house and I have to scramble to find enough cards for each deck (only one copy of Gandalf per deck) and for three or four player games we have to use dice for keeping track of threat.

I've never seen a core set go for anywhere near the price of an adventure pack (link?), but even if I did, I'd resent having a redundant set of encounter cards.

im certainly not complaining about the lcg concept at all, i just opened the topic up for discussion....yes its cheaper to buy another core set, but the useless cards are the encounter sets....

I use the spare encounter cards as backs for custom quests, that way I do not have to re-sleeve my "real" encounter cards everytime I want to run a custom quest.

Really?

cheapest core set i can see on e-bay is £28 with the postage. Plenty of APs for £7 or £8 that's a third of the price.

If I could get an extra core set for under a tenner I would- I could use the extra unexpected courage etc, but for £30 it's just excessive.

Dark Arts, indeed! I found a site in Austria just before xmas that sells cards singly for A Game of Thrones (didn't think to check for this game), and some of them were quite pricy. I was primarily shopping for the odd single to boost out the Time of Ravens cycle, and spent €25 or so to get quite a decent array, but there were the odd one or two that were €4 or more each, which is just too expensive for me! I've been known to pay nearly $4 for Star Wars TCG cards before now, but no more!

Recently, though, I've been considering buying a second core set, of course one of the major draws to this being getting a second copy of the I think 6 cards that there are only one of in the core set, but also a big reason has been to get a second copy of the encounter deck cards. I am a very lazy gamer, and feel that I don't play this game as much as I could do because it takes time to set up everything - the player deck needs to be built, the encounter deck needs to be built, etc. So if I had some encounter decks made up already, and my current deck kept in the box as well, it would be a lot less hassle to get it out and play. I think I worked out that, by buying an extra core set, I could have three of the Mirkwood adventures set up permanently, to be played with at the drop of a hat. I can't remember exactly, but I'm sure the last two adventures were there, at least.

So the only thing currently stopping me doing this is the fact that there would be 12 useless hero duplicates, all the quests, and a lot of cards that I already have three of. I suppose if there could be brought in a rule for duplicate cards similar to that in AGoT for saving your guy from dying, maybe the additional hero cards could come in handy also.

The moral of this highly fascinating tale, anyway, is that I am beginning to see a certain wisdom in buying a second core set...

I really hope they never resort to singles. However, I would easily pay for multiple copies of the encounter sets just so I could have all the quests together without needing to be stripped and reconstructed to play each new quest every time.

Considering the number of people who apparently have 3 core sets, I'm surprised you dont see more sales of (if not singles) at least extra sets of the 2-ofs from the core.  I'm pretty happy with my single core for now and can live with only having one copy of some of the cards but would gladly pay a few quid to somebody for their extra copies of hasty stroke, strength of will, and the other 2 copy cards.
