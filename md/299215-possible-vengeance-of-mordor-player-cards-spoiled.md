Per reddit: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/lotrlcg/comments/cubfbr/cards_to_come_spoilers/ [https://www.reddit.com/r/lotrlcg/comments/cubfbr/cards_to_come_spoilers/]

 

Ask not who I am, but I have seen
the cards that will soon set the scene
but be aware, those that read on
For if you want no spoilers: be gone
Though cryptic, these messages contain
A peek into the future of this wonderful game

In a reflection, two faces I saw
Both unique, but features identical
One of a higher power, the other not yet achieving its prime
But both in play, at the same time
Yet this card between them split their soul
For they can never be under the same player's control

In a dream, I saw the spirit of Gondor returned
Through a princess from the sea, who's heart had yearned
For her husband across the mountains riding in a sea of green
Together with allies rarely seen
Those forgotten, disregarded folks,
Thrown into binders, or placed between bike spokes
Yet through her power, these allies you more easily will fetch
A daughter to her father, with an ability to match

Told through the long years, these tales I have heard
Of a mission to save a very large bird
But now on the horizon, a pair of wings I saw
and heard the sound of an Eagle, a loud caw
Once nearly defeated, has now come back
With razor-sharp talons, and a deadly peck

A group of people have come from far
Four heroes, but one of them a star
Who's light had recently been ignited
From game's start, a hero knighted
But these heroes walked alone upon the road
With no-one else to carry the load

A son of a father, who died at the gate
And a dwarf who's ancestor shared the same fate
Yet strong and capable he swings his axe
While he continues milling player decks
Though already used by members in an alternate form
This hero comes to help players battle the storm

Would wear a ring with total disregard
And acts as though he is an encounter card
His songs heard from afar, through forest and down
And wights flee when they hear the sound
Yet merry is he, and his wife as well
Older than time, among trees and rivers they dwell

To the west, I saw a creature with elven ear
Singing songs to Hobbits, and all that would hear
Though the songs of gulls he did fear
He has an ability not common in the sphere
Released in a product that already did appear
To those with a friend, this time last year

From sleep, I was woken by a sound
Of many footsteps from underground
Grim faced, yet determined the walked
And behind them ghosts and phantoms stalked
They vanished into the darkness, under the mountain's door
And after that, I saw nothing more



I will leave now, and go back to rest
But I wish everyone in this community the best

--Malbeth

 

Not sure how much is to be believed, but a work of art none the less.

Just for grins here are my takes:

1.  This is the hardest.  Some have argued that this will be another two faced card like gollum, perhaps Gandalf or Saruman, yet the line "both in play at the same time"  seems to speak to me of a new version of the twins.  I wouldn't consider the bottom face in play, but maybe the text says it is.

2.  Lothiriel, daughter of Prince Imrahil and wife of Eomer.  Spirit ally/hero that provides a discount for expensive allies.

3.  Wilyador ally.  Eagles decks rejoice.

4.  Grey Company contract that allows four heroes but no allies.  It might also require one of them to be Aragorn.  Alternatively it could be spirit Aragorn who has no threat cost and allows you to play four heroes but no allies.

5.  Thorin Stonehelm.

6.  Tom Bombadil.

7.  Gildor Inglorian.

8.  Army of the Dead ally.

I also think #1 atleast has something to do with the twins.  Whether a new version or something that they greatly benefit from for some reason.

 

the one of greater power and one not at its prime one does seem to be a call out to Gandalf white/grey.   However, I think it just references that many find Elohir to be the better of the hero version of the twins.

 

4 seems to be referencing the hobbits, not the grey company

Lothíriel would be awesome, we already know of Tom Bombadil, Thorin Stonehelm and Gildor Inglorion. Wilyador would also be my guess. My bet is on the Grey Company, rather than the Army of the Dead.

Splitting their soul sounds like Voldemort, but this is the wrong game. The part of the reflection reminds me on Galadriel's Mirror, in which Frodo and Sam looked. This might indicate another Sam hero, though it makes no sense to seperate both. Alternatively it could refer to Boromir and Faramir.

Edit: As I am waiting for a Saruman hero (who is mistaken for Gandalf or vice versa), it probably refers to Saruman who cannot have Gandalf in his deck. Saruman the White is Head of the Istari, while Gandalf needs to die in the fight the Balrog first to become the White.

A spirit Aragorn as a fourth hero without allies sounds plausible.

This is pure supposition, nothing more.  I think this is FFG/ANA branching out their advertising/social media and this is the equivalent of our Friday article.

Awesome list and I agree with most of it.

 

1. Really feels like Saruman the White, or perhaps Gandalf the White. As it could refer to the passing of power from one to the next. And being able to have Saruman and Gandalf both in play but not under one player's control.

2. Totally Lothiriel, but I'm expecting something more akin to Gamling where after you discard a Gondor ally, return it in your hand. That would drastically improve the spirit Gondor allies.

 

3. Stoked!

4. Hobbits maybe?

8. Grey Company I'm leaning more towards

Does anyone else also want Wilyador to fetch Athelas for us to get some tactics Healing whenever you defeat an enemy? Haha

I want there to be Saruman but I don't see it. I make a solemn promise: If there is Saruman in the upcoming cycle, I'm going to purchase every AP and Deluxe box up to the one where Saruman is released.

I already posted this on the reddit page, but...

I would love it if it gave the opportunity to return Gondor allies to hand for some benefit. Might seem silvan like, and I am not sure what the worthwhile benefit would be. Resource generation? Threat reduction? Card draw?

But the ability would pair incredibly well with prince imrahil: tactics version could go fetch out of deck, and after their limit use in combat, Lothriel could return to hand. Or if playing with leadership imrahil, the return to hand readies. Also, if you play with the tactics version of her husband, you get the benefit of the attack boost. I'd love that combo.

Just remembered we are probably getting a Thorongil card this cycle...

That is a great idea and would be pretty cool. The only thing that is making me think something different is the poem/riddle lines, so let's break it down:

In a dream, I saw the spirit of Gondor returned 
Through a princess from the sea, who's heart had yearned
For her husband across the mountains riding in a sea of green

-This pretty much confirms without a doubt it's Lothiriel, princess from the Sea falling in love with horseback riding husband over grassy fields leaves little room for any other interpretation.


Together with allies rarely seen
Those forgotten, disregarded folks,
Thrown into binders, or placed between bike spokes

-Ok so here it seems to be not referring to a generic Ally trait in particular as there are lots of good Gondor and Rohan allies. Unless they mean Rohan and Gondor builds in general are less popular, but I still recall hearing something somewhere about a Gondor Spirit allies. And there are three terrible Spirit Gondor allies that you discard from play for an effect and these are: Minas Tirith Lampwright, Damrod, and the recently released Derufin. Now we can already "Tactics Imrahil sneak attack" them into play because of the Gondor trait but no one does this because they are still having to be discarded for not an amazing effect. So what could it be that would make us even want to play these three characters, and the most likely to me would be some kind of saving from the discard pile to the hand/shuffle into deck ability. Other options are cost reduction for Spirit Gondor allies, potentially some other effect triggering off their discarding such as placing a resource on a Gondor Hero or Eomer (which would be cool since it works with Leadership Eomer to help him recoup his cost), or something else entirely. Perhaps there is a clue in the final lines?

Yet through her power, these allies you more easily will fetch
A daughter to her father, with an ability to match

-This last part makes me wonder if they mean match as in work together or match as in identical power with her father? The latter would be fun but not super original and to my recollection there hasn't been two heroes released with the same ability yet. But still worth considering as it could be the same as Tactics Imrahil's ability but with different traits: "spend 1 Spirit resource to search the top 5 or 10 (in reference to the easier to fetch) cards of your deck for an ally that shares the same trait and put it into play" perhaps her ability could be played at any phase, or put into play until the end of the round in order to allow the Lampwright to be able to work better. Then she could have Gondor, Rohan (since she marries Eomer and they also have some great discarding effect characters) and Noble.

 

To me it really comes back to the mention of helping terrible characters. So it begs the question what would make these characters worth playing over the far better Gondor (or Rohan) allies that could potentially be brought into play? Her ability, whatever it is could be restricted to Spirit or even more specifically Spirit Gondor allies to force that theme, but then it just makes her a worse summoning version of her father. So it leads me to think she either has two abilities, or a different ability altogether that will help those three mentioned Gondor Spirits allies. It doesn't make sense to me to have her be able to discard an ally for an effect as there are cheaper/better Gondor allies you can discard, and if you discard for an different effect than you can't trigger their discard ability. If she had something trigger in addition to their discard effect than that is certainly an option (and if it was Gondor allies in general that are discarded from play generating an effect it would help the terrible Denethor ally as well) or a way to recur that Ally. It certainly is interesting and as someone who has longed for Gondor to be as strong as some of the other powerful builds like a Noldor, Outlands, and Silvins I would love to see a boost to the factions and especially the worst cards in those factions. 

 

If this is a new way of doing previews, I'm totally into it and it's sweet! I'm enjoying trying to decipher the riddles.

 

Another thought for the is the two identical characters could be the long rumoured and hoped for Blue Wizards.

Huh, that is a possibility. It doesn't really seem like something out of FFG's drastically orthodox playbook, though. Well, I suppose it's a moot point.

I have my doubts. I think if they were going to start attempting such unorthodox teasers, they would at least do so through their own forums rather than reddit.

It was on Twitter that FFG first told us that they had a bunch of reprints coming, so that indicates to me that they are branching out their social media.  Obviously that poem is way to long to tweet, but it also represents a LOT of work from someone.  Just feels like an inside job to me.

I wouldn't even call these spoilers, just teasers (if you can call it that) wrapped up in a unnecessary obfuscated poem. It's a throwaway account, this is the only post they've made, so if that's the case and they do have some info, why not go all out and actually reveal something? Until actual spoilers are revealed, I'd give this guy's words a heaping pile of salt. I vote for elaborate troll.

Third, fifth, and seventh are all confirmed now (Lothiriel; Forth, the three hunters; and Tom Bombadil). So it seems likely it’s all accurate.

A bit late to this party and with 4/8 already (5/8 if we count Gildor as a confirmed card, which is not the case) discovered it'll be less thrilling to venture, but oh gosh it's so fun!

@Bullroarer Took [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/171578-bullroarer-took/] did a fantastic job here, so my take will be to re-think some of those unconfirmed paragraphs:

 

 1. Leaning towards a double-sided hero, à la Gollum, but I see it as just one hero: Gandalf. Grey and White version but with the same name (just Gandalf), for consistency reasons (if not we could have Gandalf the X + Gandalf ally/hero at the same game). Unchecked.
 2. Lothíriel. Checked.
 3. Wilyador hero. Yes, it's a bit lame to give the hero treatment to a FFG-made character instead of Gwaihir or Meneldor but oh well. Maybe it appears on the story of this Vengeance of Mordor cycle, too. Unchecked.
 4. Forth, the Three Hunters contract card. Checked.
 5. Thorin Stonehelm (I can be picky that they didn't show the hero card properly, but given the promo card and the confirmation on the product page that we'll be receiving a dwarf hero on the first AP, this is a no-brainer). Checked.
 6. Tom Bombadil. Checked.
 7. Gildor Inglorion. I'll also be picky here: all the odds are for this card to be in this cycle, because Thorin is in here too and because it seems that after this cycle there'll be a hiatus for the game (you can watch Andrew Navarro's AMA), so it should be the best and only cycle for him. But I'll put it as Unchecked.
 8. Army of the Dead contract. Could be awesome as an ally but for me is very fitting to be a contract card, as the Oath that bound that people to serve Aragorn. Unchecked.

Are we convinced the "four heroes but one of them a star" is referring to the three hunters contract? Why the four? For saga? Though the last line does give it support...

I was about to post this exact thing. I see nothing in that stanza to support this referencing the three hunters.....not even the last line.  What load were the three hunters carrying? ( the burden of trying to catch their companions?...that’s a stretch)  And they didn’t walk upon a road..they gave chase across country.

For me it sounds more like a four-hero contract, similar to the Three Hunters, but with a fourth hero instead of three restricted attachments per hero.

We pretty much have only 3 here slots open.

Double-sided Gandalf seems to be a popular guess here. I have a hard time seeing a Daruman 'hero'.

Wilyador is coming but will he be an hero or an ally? I have a hard time believing that an ally Wilyador would be mentioned here specifically.  

 

Spirit Aragorn was often mentioned as a possibility but with both spirit spots in the cycle gone, I do not consider this likely.

 

Going by normal distribution amongst spheres we have

1xTactics

1x Lore

1x Leadership 

left.

My guesses:

Gandalf ( one side Leadership, one side Spirit)

Tactics Wilyador

Lore Sam

 

Edit: I was obviously wrong here. Frodo is Leadership and not Spirit.

 

So I guess Spirit Aragorn will happen. I therefore drop Sam off my list and expect Gandalf to be Lore.

Ok I was originally thinking Saruman as technically him and Gandalf both have the mantle of white wizard at one time or another. Could also be Gandalf the White. And small chance it may also be the Blue Wizards which would be a cool entry. But we only have three heroes yet unspoiled if we are going with the collectors edition heroes along with Lothiriel being 3/6 for this cycle. So it could be but makes more sense to have Spirir Aragorn as one and then Gandalf the White/Saruman as one or both of the remaining.

Lothiriel is amazing. Going to be a Spirit staple with that low threat and high WP alone. Not to mention how she revitalizes Rohan builds.

Wouldn't it be cool if Wilyador was a hero? And as much as I would love him to be a healing one (starts with all the excess Athelas in play from JtR!) I feel like the poem more references an attacking one. So perhaps some kind of splash damage Attack where excess damage is dealt to another enemy character or it can attack two enemies in one turn?

One of them a star makes me think Spirit Aragorn, or maybe a Fellowship one if that's the case it could be the 3 hunters one, but it just doesn't fit the rest of the poem. Was Aragorn knighted? Not to my knowledge. The hobbits were absolutely knighted by Aragorn and Eomer and there is four of them so that would be a sweet boost to have them in their scouring the Shire Mode. Also allowing you to play four hobbits would be great! You could even pair up Frodo's four friends with him (woot Fatty!) or Aragorn with the four classic Hobbits if it's not hobbit specific. They could definitely use the help and the boost.

Thorin for sure, nice for us to get him.

Hey dol! merry dol! ring a dong dillo! Ring a dong! hop along! fal lal the willow! Tom Bom, jolly Tom, Tom Bombadillo! (Seriously most anticipated ally here)

Gildor, see #5 and combines great with leaderships main weakness.

It really seems to be referring to the people that the ghosts are stalking which totally says grey company contract to me, Dunedain are one of the weaker traits so would be nice to give them a boost that works along their engagement strategy.

 

All in all very excited for this cycle, it's pretty much total fan service what most of us wanted. Very much loving this game right now!

My mistake! Frodo is leadership and not spirit. So Spirit Aragorn is very much alive...

Check it out: They do a double sided hero with different spheres, therefore opening up a slot for a neutral hero - Saruman! Yeah, not gonna happen :'D

My thoughts on the "reflection" is this.

A hero, whose setup action is to put a certain ally into play on another players side. For the sake of ease, let's say its Fili and Kili. 

So you have a double sided hero (fili/kili) of different spheres, the owner of the hero chooses which side is flipped face up. The corresponding opposite ally (kili/fili) is flipped face up and placed in another player's play area.

That's why they're split, and why one has "reached their prime" (hero status). It also works well with both contracts released... the fellowship because it gets another ally in for a player looking to get 9 uniques, and for the three hunters because it works around the dynamic of having an ally "in deck". 

It might not be fili/kili, it could be elladan/elrohir, or another set of twins I'm not thinking of... but I like the idea of a hero-ally setup. Maybe not so much the double sided choice... but to be able to play an ally out the gate, even if it's only in two+ player, is very appealing.

I want to revive this thread as it has been pretty darn accurate so far. 

1. Two faces, not yet resolved, Gandalf the White or more likely Blue Wizards are my thoughts. And it doesn't fit Saruman at all so that theory is gone.

2. Lothiriel, confirmed and awesome.

3. It's got to be Wilyador either ally or hero but the former seems more likely.

4. This doesn't seem to be three hunters too me, one of them knighted and one of them a star? Leaning towards a 4 hobbit contract that comes with a free weak spirit Hobbit hero since 2/4 of them are awful haha.

5. Thorin Stonehelm.

6. Tom Bombadil.

7. Gildor Inglorian.

8. Another interesting one, Army of the Dead ally or Gray Company ally/contract either is open game and the most likely to me.

I want to be hopeful that there is another double sided hero coming but is there a chance that 1. Could be referring to Saruman as the "mirror"? Probably not because theres that weird "not in play at the same time" issue. 

4. I like your analysis here. Maybe the front side of the contract is that you can only have heroes with the hobbit type. And then the other side is an actual hero you can use.

I am doubling down on my hero/ally setup combo. Or maybe ally/ally.

I am once again... reviving this post, with new info and one pack left. 

1) still not convinced this is totally resolved. Could be the latest Kings Messenger though. It does make an ally into a hero, though the control thing is weird.

2) check - lotheriel

3) check - wilyador AND eagle hero. Nice

4) still might the last contract. If this allowed 3 heroes + a promoted ally then I would say you are good to go with four heroes. But because of this, I say this one is open.

5) check -- thorin

6) check -- tom bombadil 

7) check -- gildor

😎 could be three hunters, though doesn't make a whole lot of sense. I say this might be open too.

I believe number one is Smeagol/Gollum.

Perhaps. Though this post came out well after the box was announced so not much of a spoiler. Theres also "in play at the same time" which isn't really the case. Further, when describing "control", one doesn't really control gollum. Not saying you're wrong by any means, but I am not 100% this is the case.

Tom Bombadil was also spoiled before the poem was released I think.

Number 1 could be the new contract, or Smeagol, its kind of weird though.

 

Definitely still think the last contract has to do with habit four hobbits, what an accomplishment it would be to make us finally use Fatty or Merry (if we get them for free!). 

 

And the last one I'm still holding out hope for Army of the Dead or if the above isn't the final contract, then one for the Dunedain since they are currently the weakest archetype.

I have on good authority that...

 

1) is coming in pack 6 and that it is radically different that what anyone has been proposing so far.

4) is coming in pack 6 but people have correctly guessed it

8.) no word on this one either way

 

2,3,5,6,7 have been resolved.

That’s very interesting. 1 is super intriguing, and 4 I feel like is the 4th hero from the start, maybe if it’s a spirit or spirit hobbit hero. And 8 we are way off eh?

Ok  let's guess differently  for 1. maybe two cards featuring aragorn, one hero spirit incarnation of his kingly gondor self and a second one  ally with a different name, making him thus playable, incarnation of his youth with the limitation he could not be played in the same deck of any  aragorn named hero... at least is different from previous guessing....

I thought number 1 was confirmed to be Smeagol/Gollum?

The give away on this is that gollum is not in play at the same time as smeagol.

My best guess on the 4th Hero clues is that it allows for playing with 4 Hobbit Heroes, but they each must be of a different sphere ("one of them a star," I am taking to mean one is Spirit).  That seems really potent, but comes at the potential cost of secrecy, so maybe it's fine.  And four resources a turn is a lot, but if it's spread across spheres maybe that's enough of a balance?  Contract could mitigate resource gain in all sorts of ways (e.g. your heros cannot gain spheres beyond their printed sphere, your heroes may not gain resources from card effects, heck the contract could even attach to one hero and prevent that hero from having a resource pool).

So, assuming the Contract is four hobbits related, that makes (1) extra tricky. If the car is double-sided, it's hard to imagine how a double-sided card would work that is not a hero or a contract, and we "know" the last Hero is Aragorn and lots of people have been guessing at a dual Aragorn that flips to "King Elessar," but that doesn't quite capture the "not by the same player at the same time" aspect of the riddle.  So maybe it's a pair of single-sided cards, but a player can only have one of them in play at a time?  Could two players have the pair in play at the same time?  It's weird to think of a card dynamic that "required" multiplayer (or 2-Handed) to use.  Maybe even something like a Beorning/Grimbeorn ally who could "transform" into an out-of-play Bear form?  Still doesn't quite seem to capture the spirit of the riddle...

I'm totally stumped on this one, which makes it so intriguing and exciting.

Alright just to finally resolve all aspects of this riddle:

 

1) Thorongil, definitely allows “2 heroes to be in play at the same time while splitting between them”

4) 4 heroes contract one of each sphere and the no one else to shoulder the load must have been referring to the no other hero can help pay for the out of sphere cards of the other three

8.) so seeing the last pack of cards.. like is this one of the Dunedain cards or event? A Desperate Path is my guess since it makes sense thematically. Anyone else have a thought on what this part of the poem was referring too.

4 sounds a lot like a combination of three contracts. 4 heroes references the Bond of Friendship contract, that's pretty obvious. The next bit sounds a lot like Messenger of the King, with an ally promoted to the rank of hero at the start of the game. The final bit could reference Forth! The Three Hunters contract, as they have no other characters on that road. But I don't understand why this couldn't be 3 different paragraphs. Maybe to throw us off?

8 did sound like a Grey Company contract or something, but looking at the cards we have now, it might just reference the fact that we got some Dunedain cards towards the end. That Sparagorn art does look like it takes place at the Paths of the Dead, but that's the most concrete conclusion I can make from that. 

The rest lines up pretty accurately with the cards we got.
