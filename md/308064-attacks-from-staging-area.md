With cards like "Cornered Orc" who attack you from the staging area, do they still get dealt shadow cards?

Generally speaking unless something specifically directs you otherwise (or the encounter deck is empty outside the quest phase) no matter the cause, point of origin or timing of the attack the enemy still gets a Shadow Card.

Unless otherwise specified, special attacks always get shadows. The exception is if an enemy engages a player during the combat phase during the enemy attacks portion (very rare in it's own right)
