I'm new to the game and had some questions witch I found and 1 question remains.

How do I determine cost of Gandalf's Search who has a cost of X?

X = however many resource tokens you spend to play the card.   If you spend 1, then you look at just one card; if you spend 2 then you look at two cards, etc.

can you give a more specific example? i dont have the cards to hand, but all X ' s stand for something pre determined in the rules, scenario or cards.

If a X cost card is not in play his cost is 0. For example, Gandalf Search in riddles tests
