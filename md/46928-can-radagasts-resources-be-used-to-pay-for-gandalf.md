I know that Radagast isn't released yet, but when he does, will his resource tokens be able to be used to pay for colorless cards, such as songs and Gandalf?  It doesn't say that they can ONLY be used to pay for creatures, so am I correct in assuming that they can be used to pay for creatures (which may have colors), OR for colorless cards?

I think that he can only pay for creatures. The fact that they make it a point to state that is what the resources can pay for makes it seem like it excludes everything else. Since most allies can't pay for anything, I would think that such an exception to the rules would be spelled out.

 I agree... since allies normally DO NOT produce resources, this is an exception, meaning only creatures...

 Makes sense.  Thank you both.

Perhaps we might see a similar Tom Bombadil card at some point who can spend resources on Songs?

 While, if I had to guess, I would agree this is likely the answer, I don't think it's at all clear. 

What's also not clear is whether he can pay for faction-specific creatures. I doesn't say anything specifically about being able to skip the resource match, so it could be that he's only allowed to play neutral creatures. Indeed there are three possible interpretations of the last line of his text box:

 

* It's intended as a restriction only- his resources can only pay for creatures. In this case he can pay only for neutral creatures.

* It's intended as an ability only- it expands the capability he would otherwise have. In this case he can pay for any neutral card, plus creatures of any faction.

* It's intended as a redefinition of the rules for playing cards by spending resources- in this case he can pay for creatures of any faction, but not any neutral card.

Too bad the White Hand Orcs never got them all the way to Isengard, I'm sure Saruman would've gotten them to "sing" even more demonio.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/demonio.gif] !

 

Yes, no amount of violence against hobbits is bad in my book cool.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/cool.gif] .

All the sensible money is on the third option.
