# [Saruman vs. Nazgul of Dol Guldur?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/111351-saruman-vs-nazgul-of-dol-guldur/)

Hey all, hopefully this isn't a silly question, and maybe I'm just reading the cards wrong or overlooking something, but here goes.

 

So I was scratching my head trying to figure out how to win Escape from Dol Guldur solo when I noticed Nazgul of Dol Guldur is not considered unique... This got me wondering, if I used Saruman's ability while on stage 3B to target the Nazgul (assuming it is still in the staging area) could I win without having to fight it if I complete the stage before Saruman leaves play at the end of the round? The quest never states you have to defeat the Nazgul, just that it has to be "not in play". Is there a difference between being "not in play" and "considered out of play", as per Saruman's response ability when he enters play?

 

Thanks!

Yes, we asked that in France. Here's Caleb answer :

> Q: Regarding the new Ally Saruman, when using it on key cards like the Nazgul in Escape From Dol Guldur, does it allow the player to win more easily? The power of Sauron is quite tempting...
> 
> A: Saruman's ability is very powerful. You can use his effect to remove the Nazgul of Dol Guldor from play long enough to escape Out of the Dungeons.

Niceee maybe i should try that guest again, with my new doomed cards i dont think that guest is really hard, especially if i am using Loragorn, burning brand and couple of self preservations oh and dunedain warnings, then i would have a real tank :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

I don't mean to be the grammar police or something but for your information, it's actually spelled quest.  A guest means a person who is new or unfamiliar to something.  

 

But yeah I was also thinking about how if you get Saruman into play on stage 1b of Journy down the Anduin you can use his ability on the Hill troll and move on to the next stage and peck at the troll with direct damage or staging area attack while he is in the staging area and he won't engage you because of the 2b quest card effect.

Here goes the linguist: it helps to know where words come from in order to distinguish between them! "Quest" is from Old French "queste", meaning a mission. "Guest" is from Old English "gast"; a visitor or stranger. Some fans speculate that this is the same morpheme as in the wizard name Radagast, though their connection between "rada" and "rudu" (red, reddish brown in OE) is a bit of a stretch.

 

On topic: Saruman is incredibly powerful, and the only thing stopping me from using him is that my Gondor and Rohan friends often start with a high threat.
