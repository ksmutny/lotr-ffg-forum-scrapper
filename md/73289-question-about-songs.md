 Been playing for a while now and greatly enjoy the game.  Have a question about the various Song cards.  If I play Song of Battle on Dain Ironfoot, for example, what exactly happens when he gains a Tactics resource icon from the Song?

 

1). He can now spend tokens from his resource pool on bothTactics resources and Leadership resources, but still only gains one resource token during his resource phase.

or

2). He gains a Tactics resource pool in addition to his Leadership resource pool and thus collects one token of each during his resource phase.

I had been using Songs under Option 2, but became uncertain that this was correct last night as my Dwarves made their way through the Seventh Level of Moria.

the correct way is 1- he gains the icon but NOT the extra resource

in all other ways he is considered a 'tactics hero' and can have cards that require a tactics icon placed on him

its also worth pointing out that if he loses the song and has for example a burning brand (with the song of wisdom) then he still keeps the brand
