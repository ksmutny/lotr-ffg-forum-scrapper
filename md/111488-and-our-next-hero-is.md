Thanks for the image Ian! Great hero IMO. This pack kinda makes some sort of ranger/scout deck viable, with Lore Aragorn and a bunch of ranger cards, and Glorfindel who just works great. With access to Asfaloth, Northern Tracker, Wingfoot which helos with action advantage, even Ride to Ruin to use with horse-breeders, and a lot of traps to take care of enemies, this kinda works as a staging area control deck for Locations and enemies. Granted, we could have made this before but Idraen and Warden of Arnor kinda make the deck really.

 

Also, I would beg you for more pictures, please, I want to see the art so badly, lol. Curious about how Warden of Arnor looks like.

woah!!!!!! got other spoilers? :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

The new hero is very cool and potentially quite good (especially with Asfaloth and Northern Trackers in play, you could ready her when clearing a location during staging from Northern Tracker, then ready her a second time after defending or attacking with her by exploring a 2 quest point location with Asfaloth during combat and then a third time by exploring the current location with Legolas's trigger after attacking and destroying a foe with him readying her for her own final attack) but not for me, wanna see them allies and attachments!!

OH MAN ELVEN MAIL IS LEGENDARY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I have to find spots for it already, that is just the ultimate for Elrohir. He will have Sentinel even without Arwen in play and will have 6 hit points alongside his armour of 6 or 7 and his ability to block several attacks provided he has resources. Hes gonna be the ultimate defender bar none, I reckon he ***** all over Beregond now, this literally fills one of the main gaps and weaknesses of my decks, couldn't be more psyched for this card. Just need art now and I can proxy it right away!

Yep, it's pretty good. Feigned Voices is also pretty good, and we got Rumil also! That's an ally everyone wanted to see. Also for this deck I'm planning, Rumpur from the Earth with Wingfoot basically becomes Leadership Aragorn's ability on the Lore one, which means in a good scenario all of our 3 heroes will be ready for combat.

## 10 [PsychoRocka on July 23, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/111488-and-our-next-hero-is/?do=findComment&comment=1166362)

That is a nice combo!! Yeah Feigned Voices is pretty cool and I have been waiting for Rumil (cause of how long ago he was spoiled and deck tinkering however I don't think I even will be using him but that may change when I actually HAVE him :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] ).

Greyflood is pretty fantastic too, Rivendell Scout is insanely good for secrecy at 0 cost for willpower and attack values and you can obviously chump block with him. Warden of Arnor is pretty sweet too.

The last three (elronds message and the two previously spoiled cards) seem to be the least useful/powerful of the lot, pretty happy about that as I thought that Leaf Brooch and Noiseless Movement were pretty meh (don't have any interest in secrecy).

Rivendel Scout works great in the Secrecy deck Beorn made which is already awesome. I dig that card. In my opinion that is one of like the 2 only viable secrecy deck so far, along with Dunhere secrecy, but this one uses Lore, in which these cards works fine IMO (noiseless movement, leaf brooch) although I haven't tested them much.

 

 

> Even cooler, the insert contains a fiull page story of one of Idraen's exploits.

 

That's pretty cool, it's great to see these characters get more development. Take the Planeswalker route, FFG, no one would care, lol.  Anyway, this is already my favorite fictional ffg heroine, both mechanic-wise and character-wise, even though the others are much cuter of course (no one says anything for Caldara?)

Idraen: wow, just fantastic.  given we originally knew this would be a spirit hero and previously spoiled secrecy cards i had anticipated that the hero for this back would revolve even if remotely the secrecy mechanic but Idraen is not that at all and man what a great ability and so great in spirit as well.  Couldnt be happier with her design and IMO she's the most useful spirit hero we've had since spirit Glorfindel (sorry but Caldara is too linear for my tastes).  I think unfortunately when given the choice spirit glorfindel will still be the more obvious parallel since he can ready more efficiently while questing through light of valinor but i'm really pleased with her design and I'm excited to have her in my collection. As pyschorocka pointed out spirit has a lot of options to make sure her ability triggers each round and it seems as though putting progress tokens on locations is the new design for the dunedain trait if this pack is any indication considering her, the greyflood wanderer, and aptly named warden of arnor all deal with location manipulation.

 

Rivendell Scout: Will be a great addition in secrecy decks since he will carry the fabulous cost of zero but other than that i dont think he would be used unless noldor gains universal buffs.  Interested to see the art although.

 

Feigned Voice: So here is the final silvan returning event that we had not seen.  As with the other 3 previously spoiled this is another great card.  Having another 3 feints with the side ability of re-triggering Silvan buffs once replaying is really great and the trait gets better with each pack.  It will be immensely satisfying even to just return an exhausted ally you may have used for questing to stop an enemy you didnt anticpated engaging you from attacking then throwing out a new ally to attack that enemy with Celeborn's buff.

 

Rumil: previously spoiled but i'll look forward to incorporating him into decks.  I kind of wish his cost was 3 instead of 4 but whatever.

 

Elven Mail: holy crap is this card phenominal.  giving the sentinal trait alone is a big deal so you no longer necessarily have to count on pulling arwen to be able to multi-defend in multiplayer.  the obvious target for this is Elrohir as mentioned previously.  It seems the elf twins are getting a host of new toys to freshen up their gameplay this cycle which is pretty great.  Celeborn and Elrond are two decent targets for this as well.  Even Gildor is a good target since it doesnt specifically mention heroes since he has 3 defense but yea Elrohir all the way.

 

Greyflood Wanderer: interesting ally who i like in theory but dont know if i'd use in practice.  kind of depends on the game situation and how many locations are in the staging area because in the end it comes down to "is a threat gain of 2 worth X amount of progress tokens" because otherwise his 3 cost his hard to justify his cost when there are other costly spirit allies that may otherwise be more deserving.  In a mono spirit deck (or heavily featured spirit deck) he would obviously work well with northern tracker but otherwise i think he may get the bump

 

Warden of Arnor: I like the card even though its not terribly strong but the real limitation is that at this point it literally can only be attached to Idraen.  I'm sure FFG intends to create more scout traited heroes (and i think we may even see one in the following pack with the potential for a lore hero haldir) but still even then...its hard to really debate the use of this card. Either you're using Idraen and you may run 2 copies or you're not running Idraen and you're obviously not using it.

 

Message from Elrond: Maybe the more creative thinkers of this board can think of better uses for it than I, but currently this card seems like a dud...i just cant even see the point unless they need a gandalf for one reason or another. maybe the art will be god.

 

Noiseless Movement & Leafbrooch: already spoiled and this post is long enough already

## 15 [PsychoRocka on July 23, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/111488-and-our-next-hero-is/?do=findComment&comment=1166416)

Man Elven Mail is like the exact card I've been hoping gets made for a while now, something that gives Sentinel AND defense/health and can go on Elrohir. He already has beasty defense, a ridiculous amount of readies provided you build up his resources but has always been weak against direct damage (especially shadow effects that deal direct damage) on his meager 4 hit points.

I'm still in shock this actually got made and is coming out so soon. Fills one of the glaring weaknesses in my two handed decks so so well and now even if I do get Arwen out but she then dies I won't lose Sentinel on Elrohir provided he has one of these. On top of this If he has defense buffed high enough and has Sentinel from Elven Mail already Arwen can instead be used to buff another defender and give them Sentinel and +1 defense instead!

A second one goes perfectly on Elrond, who is usually used for questing but if he has unexpected courage or is kept back as a defender he will have much more health to defend with and can defend for both decks. It also works very well on Gildor and Elladan.

wow, that is a AWESOME hero. Duel use heroes are becoming a real thing now.. and it is all good! (as in not deciding between quest and defend / attack.. doing both). Only thing is I wish it was Lore.

I guess, making an attachment that just one hero can utilize well (or at all) is becoming a trend of this cycle. 

 

 

On the other note, anybody noticed how powerful Message from Elrond can be? In competitive environment, lore player can carry duplicates of the events of any sphere and when needed - pass them to the right sphere player. So technically, for example, in a 3 player game, there can be 9 sneak attacks (+repeats from the tome), with only one of the players running leadershit sphere at all.

 

richsabre, it will require some heavy powerful card that requires scout ALLIES to make dale scouts worth including, which is highly unprobable.

## 23 [Noccus on July 23, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/111488-and-our-next-hero-is/?do=findComment&comment=1166717)

Indeed, message from Elrond is the card I'm digging mostly here.

Another example: all players in my group use spirit, and we all run 3 copies of Test of Will.

How many times has it happend that a devastating treachery popped from the encounter deck, and the player with Test of Will in his hand did not have a rescource left??? Many, many times I tell you.

Now you can play Message from Elrond and simply pass it to another spirit player with a spirit rescource left!

Sooo many possibilities with this card...amazing...

 

Most of the other cards are ace too by the way!

Looks like a good batch of cards to play around with.

In terms of the hero, it definitely seems like it will add some interesting deck building possibilities, but the 11 starting threat bothers me. With a push to return to secrecy, this card does not help. Unless you are going with 2 hero. But for 3 hero, you can't team her up with 2 other heroes to even start at 20. The best would be 22 with Spirit Glorfindel and a Hobbit, most likely Pippin lore. Sure, Elrond's Counsel gets you to 19 opening round, but of course that's if your running Glorfindel in the deck, which is getting kind of old. Would have been cool to have a hero that could break secrecy dependence from him, but the problem is introducing another low threat hero with really good stats means you can pair Glorfindel and said hero together. Glorfindel's impact on the player card pool has been substantial. Making him 5 threat was a giant mistake, 8 or 9 threat would have been enough of a discount and would have allowed for more flexibility in threat distribution of future heroes

Overall, i like her, although for solo play here response will not be a reliable source of readying her each round.

I don't have high hope for Message from Elrond.

 

If I take your exemple with sneak attack and test of will, either you play leadership/spirit too, or you are just putting dead cards in your deck, until you have Message from Elrond. If other don't play lore, Message from Elrond is a dead card too if you don't draw sneak attack/tes of will.

 

So the best use is with cards you can play and other can too.

 

Adding a hero that works with location being explored only make asfaloth and dunedain tracker more powerfull, and they already were... other means like new attachement or new ally are far worse and costly than these ones. Chance are, they will continue to make location asfaloth/tracker-proof and these new cards will never be powerfull enough.

I like Idraen, for her stats in the spirit sphere mostly.

Spirit has low threat level heroes, and this is a welcome change imo.

 

And she has exactly the same stats as Imrahil and a readying ability; on locations rather then allies.

She should be renamed Idrahil or something.

Dude. Lore is renown for being able to burn through own deck as fast as hell. You pick monolore and a few "dead" cards wouldn't be a problem at all.

Remember timing though.  Message from Elrond is an event, so you'd have to pass the Test of Will before revealing encounter cards.  Then, if that player doesn't use it, it gets reshuffled.  That's not entirely bad and it can be used more effectively with scrying abilities, but it's not quite as simple as you say here.  

 

I can see this card being useful for effects that target things you control, or letting other players store extra copies of cards for you - preferably events or "on enter play" effects, since they go away afterwards.

 

I like it.

I just tried her out solo. A location never showed up for 7 rounds, so her ability was useless. I think she will be better in multiplayer where a location will be showing up regularly, but solo it's very unpredictable and tough to build a strategy around locations leaving play, unless it is scenario specific, but then there are usually not a lot of enemies to deal with.

With Imrahill it's easier to have allies leaving play, and you can design a deck to make it happen regularly to ensure he will be ready for combat. with Idrean there is no guarantee a location will even be in play, or that you will clear it before combat. Also locations will be cleared when there are no enemies in play which basically just wastes her action advantage. She'll need some other readying cards to ensure multiple uses out of her, otherwise her ability is going to be to random to count on when it matters most. It will probably only happen a few times a game.

Maybe a card like wingfoot can help her out, but to bad it's lore. It's cool she is can become a pretty good defender with Blood of Numenor. Though increasing her attack with the tactics card Gondorian Fire would probably be more useful.

Of course, I only tried her once but the forecast is looking bleak for solo play for my tastes. Other, than trying to make a deck that may be theme oriented, I'm not sure why I'd use this hero over Spirit Glorfindel, i don't see anything that gives her the slightest advantage at this point. Of course that's a tough comparison, but i was hoping for something to shake up the spirit hero hierarchy a bit more. Oh well.

I'm not sure you should be.  Your previous post talked about "power" cards, not "exciting" cards.  To me there are a lot of good, exciting cards in the set, but I don't see any slam-dunk-this-card-will-make-every-deck power cards.  Especially for the solo player.

 

Still, I do want to build a true Dunedain deck at some point and this pack helps that goal.

Yeah, and it means if you draw a drawing cards, you'll draw more. But if you draw non-drawing card, you'll be stuck. Meaning that either you play cards drawing hero or you are stuck with less cards slot. And for 3 sneak attack, it would take 6 cards slot. Lore is so versatile that I have a hard time doing 50 cards deck.

Dead cards are dead cards. Even in a heavy card drawing deck. Either that, or you just forfeit and replay until you have the hand you desire, but that's not how I play. Too much a risk for me.

There is still other use that make me want to play Message from Elrond, but I don't find this strong enough yet. I'll wait for some feedback.

i can't figure out this card either.

 

you have to have a sphere match, so others can play it. the card goes away at the end of the round. and you have to plan on sharing or not being able to pay for something yourself. far too situational/reactionary (instead of proactive) for my tastes.

 

that, and i don't like playing lore. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

It's very hard to NOT draw with lore if you're aiming for it. You're just judging from a perspective of active deck, I'm talking from a support deck perspective. Support decks make sacrifices for the greater good.

I was going to mention the same thing (other than the name change, that's just silly). Both of them get more powerful in multiplayer decks because they increase the odds of their response triggering. With Warden of Arnor and a Glorfindel+Asfaloth, any time a location with 3 or fewer progress is the first to be revealed that round, you can ready her.

 

She is inherently weaker than Imrahil in a way, though. Since her ability works best with locations, revealing locations is what is most likely to ready her. But with more locations being revealed, fewer enemies are revealed, and therefore her readying is less likely to be useful. With Prince Imrahil, an ally leaving play is often due to chump blocking, which means that there are enemies to be dealt with, so Imrahil now gets ready to do battle.

Part of me feels like the 3 attack strength is just too much, given her ability. I think that she would have still been amazing, yet more balanced, at 2 attack strength, the other stats staying as they are.

Could Idraen be useful in quests that are "boss fights" like Carrock, We Must Away, etc? In these quests, you often want to quest/clear locations to manage your threat, but also need significant combat presence for the enemies standing between you and victory. For the nightmare versions of these quests, I imagine her attack power + spirit icon are a great combo.

I like her a lot.  She is a truly well-rounded spirit hero - the first really.  She's higher threat, but her stats and traits make her a great anchor hero who serves as the backbone of your lineup, able to effectively pull double or triple duty when possible.  Her ability is very nice and given spirit's location control and questing abilities, she shouldn't be too hard to build around.

No, 3 attack is just right. We already have a spirit 2-attacker, and he's not used well. 

 

About her ability: you have to be a little tricky about it. Timing location exploring and stuff. First what comes to mind is Legolas, but there is tons of others to go around.

Stats on heroes almost always receive balance through starting threat. She is weaker than Prince Imrahil (as I explained), though her presence in the Spirit sphere makes her more powerful in a way. I see nothing that indicates to me that she is unbalanced.

I'd be interested in hearing some hero line-ups that feature her.

I'm running through the list of possibilities, and trying out some options, but have not landed on anything that really clicks for me.

Any thoughts?

I just feel like 3 attack strength starts to depart from the theme of the Spirit sphere a little bit. With 2 attack strength, if she readies when a location is explored, then she could add to the attack strength of another Spirit hero, and that would help Spirit at least be able to deliver some 3-4 attack strength blows against enemies. I think that her being able to quest and then provide a sort of "attack support" would have been good enough. 3 attack strength just feels a little bit much for Spirit, and I feel departs slightly from the theme of the sphere.

Legolas can ready her during Combat.

Denethor could boost her chances of readying.

My suggestion (totally untested) would be Idraen with Glorfindel and Loragorn. Lots of location control of course (including the new Warden of Arnor and greyflood wanderer), rumour from the earth + wingfoot for Aragorn, alongside LoV on Glorfindel and location exploring stuff gives a lot of action advantage. For the rest, standard Lore and Spirit stuff, with emphasis on Rangers and traps to control enemies as well as locations. Seems pretty plausible in theory.

I would agree that 3 was too much attack for her if there were like ANY other Spirit attack options other than Glorfindel. I've been playing mono blue a lot recently and you have Glorfindel, the Trackers who you'd rather be questing with, Elfhelm, and Damrod. Leadership sometimes has a similar problem but at least they have For Gondor! and some big heroes to at least temporarily boost to where you can kill stuff. Blue needed someone else. One extra decent attacker won't push them over the edge or put them in Tactics' zone or anything like that.

I thought of the same three heroes, only for purposes of lower starting threat and more access to card draw I switched loragorn for Beravor. And because I like to play solo two-handed I thought Elladan, Legolas and Elrohir would be a good team to go with it, especially with the new elf mail card.

Yeah, my first deck with her was with, Beravor and Spirit Glorfindel, and then was thinking Aragorn lore. Seems like we all thought similarly on that. It was mediocre for solo play.

But after that, i'm kind of stumped on where she fits in. Would love to hear some other players thoughts. At this point I don't think she is the type of hero that fits into a lot of different types of decks, but we'll see as more player cards are revealed.

Ok, so you were talking about balance between the spheres. Overall, I tend to feel like Spirit is the strongest sphere already, and giving it access to more characters that improve their combat abilities is only making the gap wider. In that sense, I totally agree with you.

If you put her in any other sphere she'd feel more balanced that way, but the trigger for her readying ability would feel out of place. Also, if her attack is lowered, she wouldn't have any "good" stats and her ability to ready would become weaker.

Overall, I feel that she is fine the way she is. I don't particularly like that she gives the Spirit sphere more of an advantage, but I can deal with it. Since it's a cooperative game, it's not like making one sphere noticeably stronger than the rest will make the game less playable. It just makes you want to use Spirit more.

I think if they build on the Ranger and/or Scout and/or Dunedain traits a little more, she could probably fit better into decks designed for one or more of those traits. So Faramir, Aragorn, Beravor, or the twins would work. Right now, though, I think you're right that she doesn't have any particular synergy with other heroes.

@Tracker: Then maybe you could try mono-Spirit, I think she can work great with Caldara and Glorfindel. Add in some location exploring stuff that you probably had in the original deck, and there you go.

in my head, i'm thinking eomer, imrahil, and her.

 

horn of gondor, steward of gondor, and errand riders to smooth resources.

 

popping allies to clear locations (hello, riddermark's finest) to ready imrahil, pump up eomer, and ready our newest hero.

 

we'll see how it goes...

Not to say that you CAN'T get her ability to trigger more often, but most of those are going to happen during staging, and it's not easy to consistently clear multiple locations per round.

I always struggle with Tri-Sphere decks and would undoubtedly need another mono-lore deck for support. I am getting into mono-decks again lately (mainly for eagles) but i would say that Idraen would be good in mono-spirit. Idraen, Eowyn, Eleanor, maybe alongside a tactics deck or whatever is needed for the given quest. That is a solid three I think...and who says women are underrepresented. They are three solid heroes.

Ran Idraen with (S) Glorfindel and Denethor a couple times tonight, but I never got all the gears moving solo. I think complimented with a combat deck this could eat up locations and grant some nice action advantage (especially if Glorfindel and Idraen can get some Ranged action).

 

I included Northern Tracker, Lorien Guide, Greyflood Wanderer, Asfaloth, even Strength of Will (which actually couples nicely with Glorfindel+Light of Valinor). Ravenhill Scout didn't get his chance to shine: I picture him shooting some progress over at the right time to knock out a location and ready Idraen as needed.

 

Three Trials didn't get me enough time to setup and I quested through Into Fangorn too quickly to really see the deck working as intended. I'll try it in a multiplayer setting and hopefully it'll take off.

 

The real treat, though, has been seeing my Silvan deck come together! But I guess that's for another thread.

SPOILER ALERT, YOU'VE BEEN WARNED
Brief review - The Three Trials

My quest rating, after two games: 9/10
The quest reminds me mainly of the Steward's Fear, with the bosses and quest cards interacting in similar ways as how the plot cards and villains used to work. Various combinations can ensue, which increases the replayability. The shadow and treacheries are fairly tame. The new Dunedain hero excels in this quest; bring Northern tracker, Asfaloth and Warden of Arnor for some on demand readying. We used generic decks for our first game and got beaten (but still almost won). On the second game we slightly tweaked our decks for the quest and won. Fun and includes lots of decision space on how to proceed from one trial to the next.

My player card rating: 9/10
A very solid pack of cards, especially for secrecy decks. The new hero is a blast, think Aragorn-like stats and readying ability with Asfaloth/Glorfindel's or Legolas' help. She particularly excels in multiplayer games; in solo, not enough locations come out to warrant her inclusion in my opinion.

Look forward to the next podcast episode for some more discussion on the expansion pack, and the opinions of the rest of the crew.

I'll give a few detailed spoilers here, so look away if you don't want to be spoiled! 

 

 

 

- There are three unique Guardian enemies, three unique Barrow locations, and three unique Key objectives. Each Key objective is associated with a particular Guardian.

- There are three different stage 2 cards (stage 1 is basically a setup). Each one represents a different type of trial (perseverance, strength, and intuition) and you get to choose which trial you want to face and in what order. Once you pick a trial, you randomly select a Barrow location and objective/guardian. Each trial works a bit differently.

- It is similar to Steward's Fear in terms of replay value in having the combinations of different locations, trials, and guardians, but plays out very differently.

I give it two thumbs up. Between the random nature of the encounters and their varied effects (lots of attacking, threat raising, location lock, searching through the encounter deck, etc) and the fact that you're fighting a Guardian from round 1, it is very intense and rewarding. I've only played it solo, and so the last stage is very difficult, but I can't wait to see it multiplayer.

Getting back to Idraen for a moment I'm coming around to her being 3 attack.  Consider a secrecy deck with her and (who else?) Spirit Glorifindel. Starting threat 16 and can crack back for 6 damage right out of the gate.  Attacking for 6 is pretty much the magic number right now because there are so many enemies with 4/2, 3/3, 2/4 defense/hit points.  It's important as a solo player to be able to remove these engaged threats right away so they don't trigger.

 

Starting to brew now.

Yes, but if you can use it when there is no enemy for that round, you can keep cycling that location over and over. You can also use several "tricks" to prevent enemies from engaging, especially in the Spirit and Lore spheres.

Hmm yes I think you're right. It's not gonna work in all scenarios but most of them probably. 

 

Also still no ffgapp link to The Three Trials!... I want to see the cards!

Well she's definitely awesome and brings needed elements to the Spirit sphere, all other Spirit heroes have only had at most 9 threat so having an 11 threat hero means they're more versatile and you're in the sphere that can lower your threat so she is super good, I hope for more high threat Spirit heroes.  Her ability is obviously better in multiplayer and will be hard to trigger as often in solo.  I really like how they had an insert about her, it's helps her feel more real and all FFG made heroes should have something like this  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I'm kind of doing a 180 on my thinking on her. I'm having a lot more fun with her in solo than expected and her response is a nice bonus when it does trigger. The 3 attack is pretty substantial. Team her up with Glorfindel and just about every mid range enemy will fall in combat, which is a pretty big deal for spirit decks.

She really shines in 3 trials since locations are leaving play regularly, but so far on some older quests her response has less of an impact, but overall this can be worked around with spirit readying cards.

However, without Glorfindel in a solo deck I find my options are a bit more limited for selecting other heroes, so in some ways she's another card that makes the spirit sphere and particularly Glorfindel even stronger than before, but I'm done complaining.

I posted that a day before the cards were up, and I kept a close eye till they were all in the page. For some reason though, they never put the quest cards in the page! 

 

Anyway thanks for putting the link.

She is a total solo hero for sure. The more players the less you really need duel use heroes. Her ability is limited by location exploration but this is forming a really cool deck. I am not ready to call it done (I finalize decks at the end of the cycle) but Lore / Spirit solo deck is showing GREAT promise.

 

Especially with Rivendale Scout.. Tracker, Guide, I.Tracker, etc... I think it is the start of a new encounter control deck where you leave the locations in the staging area and then use R.Scout to complete these locations at a time of your choosing. We have a lot of tools for placing exploration markers as well as moving them with R.Scout. Even ways to remove the threat of a location every quest phase so storing tokens on a location dose not add threat... It is kind of like when we used to run SNARE and IN FIGHTING to move damage around.

 

I have a suspicion that this could be the start of a new "type" location entering and leaving play effects.. we already have a few, and she will be a major player in this forming deck.

To be completely honest I don't think they're gonna develop it further than this pack. Sure we will get some more scout heroes in the next APs, but they're not going to make this scout theme deck viable anytime soon. It's just the FFG way I guess.

@Booored

I like what your thinking. Here is a possible strategy that calls for some seldom used cards. Keep Thror's key attached to her until a location pops up with a nasty travel effect with lots of quest points between and between 1-3 threat. The threat choice will be based on how many Power of the Earth you have in hand.

Let say you completely neutralize a location effect with Thor's key, then you eliminate its staging area threat with power in the earth. Now if you have some cards that can put progress on the location like Asfaloth each round, if the location has 6 quest points and you get 2 or ravenhill scouts in play you can pretty much clear a location the moment it shows up in the staging area, or wait until you need to ready Idraen for combat.

That sounds like a lot of moving parts, but could be pretty neat once it's all set up.

I think the goal is to have a high point location as the travel area. Place travel markers on it with Guide. This way even if you fail to quest you still place progress tokens. Though the goal is to not ever clear it, just use it as a "storage area" for tokens which you move with R.Scout and Asfaloth, to drop 4 on a location on a whim. This is only a few cards.. 2 in fact, 3 with the Guide.

I dunno, I think there is something missing still, but the basics of a interesting deck is there I think. Riddermark's Finest drops 2 tokens at will... as dose Strength of Will, Ride to Ruin (combo's with clandra). Remeber she untaps as a response, you could use clearing locations as a way to untap between combat. Untap her with Asfaloth by clearing the travels location then tap her again to drop Strength of Will as you travel, and then untap her again after that gose off, especially if there is a tracker out topping up all the locations in the staging so they only need a little thing to "tip them over.

Still yeah, I have no idea if this is worth it, but it feel like this could be a thing, though locations are getting more powerful and less often of late.. still I'm curious to see what the rest of the set gives us. I only really put effort into deck making after pack 6.

But if the active location is absorbing progress and then redistributing it, how do you make progress on the quest. You'll have to clear it at some time, rather than just have it sit there. Maybe I'm not understanding the strategy completely, but look forward to hearing hearing if it works out for you.

This is more of a setup strategy. It keeps the staging area clean while readying Idraen often so that you have time to set up the rest of the deck. This only really works in quests where there is a stage that it doesn't hurt to progress slowly on. I also suggest Path of Need to go along with this strategy. If you can get it into play during this "setup" time, you can have several turns where none of your heroes exhaust to do anything while you build up your ally army. This seems quite powerful to me. Too bad you can only have 1 copy of Path of Need in your deck. Makes it less reliable... but that's what Master of the Forge is for, right?
