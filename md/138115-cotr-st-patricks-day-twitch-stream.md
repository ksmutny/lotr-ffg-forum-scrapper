Join the Cardboard of the Rings crew tonight!

 

Tonight, on St. Patty's Day at 8:30 PM ET, the CotR crew will host a twitch stream for the ages!

 

In full support of the annual lifting of the Lenten drinking restrictions, each player in tonight's stream will have a specific imbibing trigger. Songs will be sung! Snakes will be banished! Can the fellowship vanquish the quest before slipping into sweet, sweet shadow? Only one way to find out!

 

As always, come drink alone, together!
