In multiplayer, if a player uses Hero Arwen can another use Ally Arwen Umodiel (sp)?

Thanks!

The player can include ally Arwen in his/her deck, but cannot play the Arwen ally unless the Arwen hero is somehow destroyed or discarded.Â  Basically, since Arwen is unique, there can only ever be one Arwen in play at a time.
