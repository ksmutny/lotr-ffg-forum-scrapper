Hi guys,

I know that this has been commented in the past but I still have a doubt.

The faq indicates that Feint should be played any time before resolving step 1 of the target enemy’s attack during the combat phase. (Once the act of resolving an enemy’s attack begins, it is too late to prevent it from attacking with Feint.)

It's clear.

But is the shadow card dealt?, I understand that it wouldn't be resolved.

Regards,

Yes, the shadow card is dealt. This can either be a great help if the shadow card was nasty and/or had a nasty effect if it entered the staging area during questing, or it could be bad if it wasn't a bad encounter card or if it was one of the player encounter cards (the Dunedain, the Ship, or the Eagle).

Hi,

Thanks for your answer, I think it's important to know if the shadow card is dealt because it could be an objective (I had the case) or something important in the game and it would be lost.

The rule to deal the shadow card is a little unclear in this case because if the enemy doesn't attack the shadow card shouldn't be dealt.

Shadow cards are dealt right at the start of the combat phase, before you have an action window to play Feint. Think of it like a computer program. At that point, the program doesn't know whether or not the enemy is going to attack.  It just deals a shadow card to every enemy engaged with a player.

Shadow cards are dealt to all engaged enemies, unless the encounter deck runs out.  In the case of Feint it is played after shadow cards are dealt; but even if an enemy were in a Forest Snare it would still get a shadow card.

Hey guys! First time posting here, I'm having a great time playing this game, but I have a questions regarding Feint. Once I played Feint and didn't declare a defender, should the shadow card stay face-down or should be resolved by flipping it?.

 

Thank you!

Leave it facedown and discard it when the enemy is destroyed, or at the end of the combat phase if the enemy is not destroyed.

Here's a question: Which happens first? Archery or shadow cards?

Since both have the timing "at the beginning of the combat phase" I would think that as in other cases like this the choice of the order is up to the first player.

I usually play it by first dealing the shadow cards, since it's a framework effect of the game itself, so it seems logical to me that takes precedence on some specific card effect.

I'm curious about a scenario where it would matter which order they are done in.  I suppose if there were a response triggered by damage that could kill an enemy before it gets a shadow it would matter, but is there any card like that?

i.e. after y ally leaves play, deal x damage to an enemy.

Descendant of Thorondor can damage enemies in staging when leaving, but you'd need an enemy that gets a shadow while in staging that is not immune to card effects.  Is there a scenario where that happens?

Is there a non-immune location that can damage or discard an engaged enemy?  Meneldor places two progress on a location when leaving.

Here's one:

You have Silver Lamp attached. You would want shadow cards to be dealt first, giving you information. You could make smarter choices about whether to let archery damage kill off your would-be chump blocker, or whether you can afford to place an extra damage or two on your defending hero, etc.

Here's another:

Archery goes first, and Melendor is killed, exploring a location.  You can then put it on top of the encounter deck using A Watchful Peace, ensuring that you can a certain card as a shadow card, if archery has gone first.

Can you use feint against the Black Serpent attacks in Crossing of Poros?

He's not immune to player card effects, so that should be fine.

And only if he is engaged with a player

If he attacks in principle he is engaged, or so Caleb said
