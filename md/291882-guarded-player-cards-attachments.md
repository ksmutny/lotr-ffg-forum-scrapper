Hi!

How do the Guarded Player cards Attachments are played? If they are added to our player deck...how do they become guarded?

Examples: Necklace of Girion [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Necklace-of-Girion-TWoR] , Glamdring [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Glamdring-RAR] from the Ered Mithrin cycle.

They become guarded whenever they enter play, either through being played from hand or put into play via any other card effect.

That is why they are so cheap. You pay 1 resource, get 2 attack and another excellent effect, but have to deal with an encounter card before you can benefit from it.

So after i pay the 1 resource i need to add that attachment in staging area and discard cards from encounter deck until i get an enemy/location, put that enemy/location to guard the attachment, eliminate the enemy/location by questing or combat and then take the attachment and use it ?
