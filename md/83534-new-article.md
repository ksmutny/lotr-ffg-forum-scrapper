They mention there is alternative art cards needs to be sleeved in opague sleeves to be tournament legal in Game Night Kit article but doesn't say which cards have alternative arts.

Are there actually alternative art cards with Season 2 Game Night Kits or did FFG mean Nightmare Cards when they said alternative art cards?

My FLGS said that they had some "alternate art cards" but they may have meant the nightmare decks, so my question is the same as yours, Ellarath

I'm confused of what encounter decks these new nightmare decks enhance. Are they for any scenario or something?

Each new Nightmare Deck replaces some or all of the cards in the particular scenario's original encounter deck (e.g. the Nightmare Deck for Passage through Mirkwood has a new version of Ungoliaunt's Spawn that replaces the original version.

Yeah, I knew that. Season 1 enhanced the three scenarios from Core, but what does Season 2 enhance? Or are these just a reprint for the nightmare decks for the Core scenarios?

I could be wrong, but I believe they are referring to the alternate art cards that they mention are included with the game of thrones kit. I don't think they are referencing the lotr kit in that statement.

From the tiny text on the picture from Article, I can make out
blob blobblob blob Gollum
Cblobblob Cblob
A blob to Rbloblob

I think it's safe to assume Season 2 contains Nightmare deck for first 3 AP of Mirkwood Cycle; Hunt for Gollum, Conflict at Carrock, A Journey to Rhosgobel.

*squints at the small picture* Yeah, you're right. That's good to know. Not sure why FFG didn't mention that within the body text. Man, I still need to get the 1st one… >.>

I believe Rich had the Second Breakfast article in mind when announcing it. I like the new deck for its theme, and as the epilogue to the article claims, the best thing about it is that it should only get much better with new cards coming in. I would be also looking forward to putting some born Gondorian to the deck in Aragorn's stead. That Gondorian Shield is as good as I hoped it would be.

yeah i meant the breakfast article- i thought it was the old one at first, and the other article seems to have buried it immediatly.

Looks like FF updated the game night kit with this :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] : "Three new Nightmare Decks, each with twenty-two cards: The Hunt for Gollum, Conflict at the Carrock, and A Journey to Rhosgobel"

Wow, that did get buried with the game kit info dump. I didn't notice that article until you mentioned it. O_o

The way they worded it ons different article it sounded to me like the alternate art was for a different game and LotR got nightmare scenarios instead.
