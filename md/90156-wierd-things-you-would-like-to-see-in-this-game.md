Gollum hero. Yes. For some time, he sincerely helped Frodo. I would make him a Spirit hero with some sort of a tradeoff card text.

 

Wose allies. Yes, again. Maybe some set of neutral ally cards, represented by Woses. Or even spread across spheres like Drummer in leadership, Hunter in tactics, Pathfinder in spirit and etc.

 

What wierd things would YOU like to see in this game?

I wouldn't necessarily call it "weird", but after some time I wouldn't mind seeing another sphere, and not just a saga sphere that doesn't extend beyond the saga.

I'd bet that down the road we'll see more spheres. I'd also like longer quests that maybe go beyond the current max threat level of 50 :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

> Two words: zombie hobbits

While I suppose that does qualify... I think that is an abuse of your privilages here.

Throw him off the bus!

Edit:

I forgot the rest of my post.

First, yes I would like to see a smeagol hero come late into the trilogy saga.

Personally I would love to see a mechanic to play off and reward you for playing at high threat. If any of you ever played the old Army of Two xbox games, there was this great idea of aggro. Basically the more attention you draw to yourself the less the other player was noticeable. It was a great mechanic that actually made the other team member practically invisible at some points.

Would love to see a similar themed mechanic here. After all isn't that exaactly what aragorn gandalf and all of rohan and gondor were doing while frodo sam and smeagol were going secrecy?

Ok, this is more seriously:

 

I think it would be cool if we had a box in which we could play for the other side. Find these hobbits, lead an orc army, ravage Ithilien, make intrigues against your allies.

Isn´t that kinda represented by enemy engagement cost?

 

If you have a threat of 42 and your partner plays a secrecy deck and has threat 16, you´re pretty guaranteed to engage all enemies over your partner (he is seeming almost invisible to enemies).

As for player cards that can only be played at a certain (high) threat level for a lower cost (kinda like a reverse secrecy) might be kinda fun. If it´s done properly theme-wise.

I’d love to see a core set on the Sauron side, followed by expansions & cycles just like the normal game. One could have “villains” as a counterpart to “heroes” and have a deck of evil themed cards, with evil mission type of quests fighting against the free peoples.

Some villains could be like boss characters already in the encounter deck as there are not so many named evil characters other then then Witch-King, Khamul, Saruman and a hand full of Orcs. How would you like to play as Ghulat or Dru-Buri_dru for example?

what about magic? you'd have to restrict it to people like gandalf, of course -- i'm sure he did a few spell-type things in the books. he might not have stood over a cauldron reciting little poems, but i seem to remember that he did use his staff for a few magical things.

maybe they could work like attachments. attach them to gandalf, and then exhaust them when you want to use them

 

i really want the game to get more involved and complicated, though -- so it ties all the quests together. imagine if we could pick up an object in one quest (in the same way that we do treasures), and then deliver it to someone in another quest... giving us a great new weapon, or something.

or maybe they could have a great new ally who won't join us until we've completed some part of another quest, to gain his trust... stuff like that.

An expansion of nothing but Beornings.

On the more serious side, if FFG could ever secure the rights to the first age, playing as the Valar in their fight against Morgoth would be pretty amazing.

Yeah this is already partially built into the game. There are advantages in staying low or starting high. I was specifically referring to the secrecy idea in reverse. Ie instead of Secrecy where you can play the card anytime but get a bonus if you are at 20 or lower threat there being essentially an opposite trait where you get bonuses if you are over 40 for example.

There are a lot of things that I would like to see that I don't think are necessarily weird - even the super-quests that go beyond 50 threat were suggested by the core rulebook, which I'm very fond of mentioning  :rolleyes: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_rolleyes.gif]

 

I never thought we'd see a Saruman player card, and yet I am shortly to be proven wrong! I think Ent player cards would be weird, so we'll see if the same thing happens here, too...

the good thing about having magic, is that it could apply to every enemy at once. they'd have to make it pretty expensive because it would be so good, but it would be cool if gandalf could lift his staff up and damage every enemy on the board, or send all of them running back into the encounter deck.

 

i also think that it would be cool if they did some more spheres, but i think they have left it too late for that now. the new sphere would have too much catching up to do.

Since that was a specific moment from the book, I could see them wrinkling it into a saga encounter, but not the "general" encounter decks?

Someone's already touched on a Gollum/Smeagol hero.... taking that a bit farther:  A traitor technique for multiplayer.

 

For example:  Smeagol/Gollum, Saruman, and Denthor hero version.  That all start the game as positive heores, but convert when the controlling player reaches a certain threshold.  Then begins working WITH the encounter deck against other players... Or perhaps instead of dying when the player reaches 50, his/her deck remains in play but converts in some manner.

 

Or eventually a "juggernaut" style game (1 versus 3) where an actual person manipulates an enhanced encounter deck against 3 other players.

I've toyed around with what I affectionately call "encounter mode," where I control the encounter deck and other players play against me.  We affectionately called it 'encounter mode.'  Tried it a couple of different ways, but one way that worked fairly well was to have the 'encounter master' draw  X+3 cards at the beginning of the game, where X is the number of players (excluding the EM).  At questing the EM decides the order of cards to be revealed, THEN heroes commit, then you reveal.  At combat the EM draws X cards, where X is the number of shadow cards that are to be dealt.  He can then freely decide which enemy gets which shadow card.  

 

Needed to come up with special rules for cards that do things like shuffle the encounter deck, scry, etc.  I haven't done it for awhile but I think what we did was to try and make a distinction between cards in the EM's hand vs in the actual encounter deck, and rework some of the scrying effects.  All a little fuzzy now.  Need special rules for objective cards too, or the EM can just hold them back.  Fun, but needs a lot of conversion to make it workable.

Dru-Buri-Dru is not evil, and would make a reasonable ally or even hero in current environment.

We've had ally-objectives, so it would be interesting to have hero-objectives. Maybe one that you can use for other quests once you've discovered them in a quest...that could give a feel of "unlocking" a hero by completing a quest.

the problem with these ideas (which i agree are good) is the lcg format. having heroes to unlock give that pack priority over others which is not the lcg form i think

 

however it could already be aruged that this is the case. you need to buy khazad dum before any of the dwarrowdelf cycle, you should buy return to mirkwood to get the dwarf god dain.

 

perhaps if they were placed in the delue expansions to be used in the following cycle?

This is similar to a player running Sauron in Knizia's game with the second (Sauron) expansion.  I think it's great.  (But I would still like to see a 1v1 game too.)

I like the idea of doing something like that in a deluxe expansion. Would be another thing to make the deluxes special.

that is a point- how many of us see the deluxes as just big APs? i do, though i wish i saw them as the gateway to a new cycle like they are meant to be. i think often the cards are sometimes weak versions of what is to come. i would like to see some deluxe cards in the deluxe cycles

Hey guys. Been playing this game for a long time but am new to the forums.

 

There is a good bit of talk about a Gollum Hero. Here is my thought and I'd like your opinion.

 

Have a two sided card. One side is Gollum the other Smeagol. He would have some effect that causes him to flip between the two. He can have an additional effect like "Response: When flipped to Smeagol characters you control get a bonus to something or Resonse: When flipped to Gollum lower the engagement cost of enemies in the staging area.

 

The effects can be anything but he would be a really unique hero if he had two sides.

 

What do you think ?

Maybe WOTC would demand for ripping off Innistrad?

 

No but really, I haven't thought of this before and, if they decide to do a Gollum hero (I doubt it though), this would be the way to go. Show his "Slinker" and his "Stinker" sides in each of the card sides, and make him have an effect that causes him to flip after something happens or maybe something like "at the end of the refresh phase, raise your threat by 2 or flip Gollum." I think the two sides of the card should be named Gollum, but one has a positive ability and the other has a negative ability. That'd be really neat actually, maybe for a Saga expansion based on Frodo, Sam and Gollum in the Dead Marshes and Ithilien. The only problem with this idea is that one treachery in Foundations of Stone that makes you shuffle a hero you control in your deck and that lets you play it if you draw it.

I don't think that Smeagol/Gollum would be a player card, so it wouldn't need to be two sided. Just replace as needed.

Show his "Slinker" and his "Stinker" sides in each of the card sides, and make him have an effect that causes him to flip after something happens or maybe something like "at the end of the refresh phase, raise your threat by 2 or flip Gollum." I think the two sides of the card should be named Gollum, but one has a positive ability and the other has a negative ability. That'd be really neat actually, maybe for a Saga expansion based on Frodo, Sam and Gollum in the Dead Marshes and Ithilien. The only problem with this idea is that one treachery in Foundations of Stone that makes you shuffle a hero you control in your deck and that lets you play it if you draw it.

Running off this idea, I'd like if instead of a standard hero he was more like the bilbo or frodo heroes in the saga expansions where he doesnt count towards the hero limit, doesnt collect resources, and has low stats.  Could have positive and negative passive abilities so he's just kind of there but doesnt drastically influence the results of the game.  Like the smeagol side would..."ignore all travel requirements" (since he helped guide the hobbits to morder it would demonstrate his knowledge of the terrain) but his gollum side could be more like "Increase the quest points of all locations in play by 2" (to demonstrate how he sometimes would maneuver the hobbits to a path for to his benefit like shelob's lair).  

 

Then there would have to be a mechanic to have him randomly change sides.  Maybe discard the bottom card of your deck (bottom so that it can't be influenced by stargazer) and if the cost is even (including zero) he is smeagol but if the cost is odd he's gollum.

I think an idea with a two-sided player card is cancerous and should never see the light of day.

Ouch, I didn't think it was that bad of an idea.

Two-sided player card breaks core mechanics of a player card type itself and interferes with eveyrthing. Even two-sided encounter card would be an abomination of an idea in realities of LOTR LCG.

But the Quest cards are two-sided...

 

Anyway, I'd just like to add my opinion to this, for what it's worth. It does sound like a good idea, having the two faces of Gollum. But perhaps having two separate cards would get around certain objections? So, rather than effects that flip the one card, the effect would be to "put Smeagol into play" and place the Gollum version out of play, and vice-versa. Hopefully that wouldn't be too fiddly (or objectionable).

 

But it is a really nice idea, and one that I hope we see explored soon. Gollum so far has only made it into the game as his bad side, but he does spend a decent amount of time as a more helpful character, and it would perhaps be remiss to miss this out.

Again if he were a hero it should be as Smeagol, not Golum. Though this would be quite funny if we went back to playing Hunt for golum with Smeagol helping out... :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Sorry, the sense I got from your last post was that any double-sided card in this game is an abomination, or the spawn of satan, or whatever.

Well, I'm pretty sure I specified "player cards", which are Heroes, Allies, Events, Attachments and Treasures, and "encounter cards", which are Enemies, Locations, Trecheries and Objectives.

Well I honestly don't think we should ever get a Gollum "hero" period but aren't we discussing fictious ideas that aren't going to see the light of day anyway? Just figured it would be an interesting way to exemplify his duality.

Years ago I played the decipher Star Trek CCG (First Edition), and they introduced several double-sided cards (DS9/Terok Nor, for example), and they were all very cool cards. I wouldn't have a problem with FFG doing double sided cards, if it was something that thematically had a dual nature (like Gollum/Smeagol previously mentioned).

Gollum(Smeagol) does not interferes with anything, unlike double-sided player card format, and he fits thematically. Two-sided player card breaks certain elements of the game.

Tactics: siege weapons that allow you to destroy locations  Something like:

Attachment: Gondorian Trebuchet
Cost:3
Text: can only be attached to a hero with the Gondor trait.  Exhaust Gondorian Trebuchet and attached hero to discard a location with three or fewer progress points remaining.
 

Lore: a library card that would allow you to stack other cards on it and play/pay for them in alternative ways.

Spirit: pipes for every trait (Eagles too, why not? this is the weird forum right?)

Leadership: a card that would allow you to remove progress tokens from a quest to gain resources.something like:

Event: Lingering for Loot
Text: remove 2 progress tokens from the current quest to add two resource tokens to any hero

Enemies that can go into the player deck then attack you when you draw them

A treachery that can corrupt a hero and you have to fight them like the Woses until you win them over

Locations that can turn into enemies and attack you like:

Location: Restless Forrest
3 Threat
6 Progress
Forced: If the players quest unsuccessfully, Restless Forrest engages the first player and become an enemy with 4 attack, 4 defense, and 4 hit points. 
Response: If the players damage Restless Forrest, return it to the staging area.
If Restless Forrest returns to the staging area, it loses the enemy type and becomes a location again.

Lol, how about Gondorian Trebuchet would damage locations instead of discarding it. During combat phase, you make an attack against location in the staging area, using, say, 5 as your attack and this location's Threat strength as a defense for that attack and place damage on that location, discarding it when damage on this location reaches or exceeds it's quest points.

Multi sphere cards.  (Not that weird I know, but it is a good design space.)
