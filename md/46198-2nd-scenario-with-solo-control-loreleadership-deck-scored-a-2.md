Today I created a Solo Deck for the 2nd scenario and scored a 2.

Ended with a threat of 19, no damage on the heroes and 17 victory points (2 Hill Trolls, Marsh Adder and 2 Gladden Fields.

Gloin to take the damage for resources, healing him up with Lore cards
Denethor/Henamarth Riversong to see which encounter card comes next
Glorfindel for questing
Played Gandalf 6 times total to decrease your threat (3 times with Sneak Attack)
Forest Snare for big enemies (Hello fat troll, here is my trap for you!)
