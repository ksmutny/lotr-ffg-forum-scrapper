I have questions on these guys to make sure I'm understanding them correctly.  Their powers are pretty cool, so I figured I'd make sure I'm not misunderstanding how they are applied.

1.  For Dunhere, he can attack an enemy in the Staging Area during the combat phase of the game - and he gets +1 to attack.  I assume this is done with impunity, right?  So the enemy in the Staging Area can't attack him back in any way, shape, or form.  Right?  If so, he is awesome at picking off high level enemies that can't escape the Staging Area.

2. Northern Tracker.  If you Quest him each round, he gets to apply his 1 progress token to every location in the staging area every round, right?  So if he quests three rounds in a row, then he could theoretically do 3 progress tokens to a single location if it was in the Staging Area all three rounds.  is this right?

 

Thanks!

Correct, but please note that Dunhere must do it alone, so if the target enemy has a defense of 3 or more, Dunhere would be useless unless you can boost his attack value.

Yes, and note that the progress tokens are placed there in response to Northern Tracker's commit to quest, so it might get the location(s) explored and discarded from play before staging step, and would not count in final threat of the staging area in the resolution step.

Thanks for the response!  I'm glad I've been using those correctly.  Those are pretty handy special abilities.
