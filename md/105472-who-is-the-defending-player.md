Some shadow cards do something to the "defending player".      Does that mean the player engaged with the enemy or the player who controls the character who is defending the attack?   

EG:  Player 1 is using a character with Sentinel to defend an attack of a monster engaged with Player 2,  "Under the Shadow" (CORE) is the shadow card.   Which player raises their threat?

The defending player is the player who the enemy is engaged with.  So in your scenario, Player 2 would raise his/her threat.  

 

Don't recall a source for that, but I'm sure I could come up with something official if you prefer :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

From p. 9 of FAQ:

 

Q: If a player does not declare any defenders against an 
attack, is he still considered the defending player?
 
A: Yes, the player an enemy is attacking is considered 
to be the defending player. Whether or not he declares 
defenders, and whether or not any other player 
declares defenders for him, does not change his status 
as the defending player for the attack.
