During the encounter phase, each player got an enemy.

 

***round 1

 

The player 1 block and attack is enemy, same for the player 2.

 

The player 1 kill his enemy and the player 2 struggle with him and can't killed him.

 

***round  2

 

does the player 1 can help the player 2 to kill his enemy?

 

****************************************************************************

 

Does the player 1, during the round 1, could assigned one of his hero or allie to help the player 2 to kill his enemy? or vice versa?

 

I know that a Range allie can attack across the board and sentinel could block.

 

 

thanks

I think you answered your own question.  Characters with ranged can attack enemies engaged with any player, and characters with sentinel can block enemies engaged with any player.  Other than that, there isn't any way to help unless a card specifically say so.

I may be mistaken, but it sounds like you are under the impression that you can keep attacking the same enemies over multiple "combat-rounds" in the same combat phase.

If that is the case you should know that you can only declare 1 attack against each enemy with which you are engaged during the whole of the combat phase.

Ok I see, I thought that each player's could help each other at any time. Its weird when only one monster is out of the staging area and only one player can attack it, depending of his threat level.

But at least they can asign their toons at the same time during the quest phase.
