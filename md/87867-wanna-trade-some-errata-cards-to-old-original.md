I like to collect stuff and I have gotten the thought that I wanna try and assemble a whole original non errata core set. I had it and sold it when I thought I wouldn't play anymore and now it impossible to get a new pre 2012 edition.

So, since the cards that has been updated are cards that probably won't see much play for those with a second and third core set I thought that I might be able to trade them.

I'm only interested in the few cards that have been errata'ed, that is, I would like to trade the new corrected edition ones I have for the old original ones. The cards must be mint or in a condition that you can't see they have been used.

The cards are these:

Dol Guldur Beastmaster x 2

Nazg√ªl of Dol Guldur x 1

The Necromancer's Tower quest card 1

So in all it's only 4 cards. I know, it's a little sad but when I first got an idea I can't let it go.

If anyone are interested let me know. Either here or PM me.
