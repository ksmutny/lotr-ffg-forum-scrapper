FYI, this is a fairly old video now. Please feel free to point out rules we've screwed up. I hunkered down and spent the last 2 weeks really making sure I fully understand absolutely every rule, and have read through every single card a few times to make sure I'm not glossing over anything- so hopefully future videos will be less mistake prone, but I find it's easier to make mistakes in OCTGN than it is when playing the physical game.

Nothing, really. Just like a network callsign :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] We have a few sites together, and our logo was meant to look like the old RKO Radio globe with a radio tower. It's silly.

I like your videos guys. You start slow but your learn fast and now you are pretty good team. Would like to see your Nightmare play trough. Nmode is when real game begin.  Keep it on guys!

I love the videos, I subscribed both of your LOTR playthrough channels on YT.

Just increase audio quality and everything is perfect.

Some mistakes...

Erebor Record Keeper can’t defend or attack. Shadow card gets enemy who is trapped. And several small mistakes.

 

Your game is still improving. I like to see next your video.

And Steven, you are too quietly compared to others.

Thanks guys!

 

Yeah, we'll continue to make mistakes. Not seeing the cards in front of you definitely adds to that- playing in OCTGN makes it ore difficult. 

 

Sorry for the mic issue, that was also my boneheaded mistake.  I grabbed a nice new microphone, used it... realized the audio quality was bad, and found that it was because I accidentally set it to record from my computer's built in mic.

 

Still workin' it out, but we'll smooth it out :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] Thanks for following!
