Does anyone have any experience with this combination?

 

- Hero Gandalf + Wizard Pipe

- X Questing hero + Expert Treasure-hunter

 

This basically means +2 resources every turn, as long as you quest succesfully.

I can't judge yet on how consistent this can be set up, but when it does it really pays of.  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

That is a combo I have never thought of and I bet it would work. The only problem I see is that Gandalf can only play color cards off the top of the deck and you can only use wizard pipe once per round so you severely limit what you can choose to play. I still think it's worth trying.

This combo is older than the same Melkor

I think people was discussing it as soon as the stuff got spoiled.

I gave used this combo very often and to good effecr. Cards as Gather Information and the powefull card in a Gandalf deck Word of Command help set up this combo.

Thanks, I try to avoid most of the older strategic topics for now, because I would like to explore possible combinations myself.

So I was pretty excited when it succeeded the first time, after having thought of it whilst looking through my cards.

 

And I don't think Gandalf can only play cards from certain spheres, right?

Sphereless cards can be paid for by any hero if I understand correctly..
