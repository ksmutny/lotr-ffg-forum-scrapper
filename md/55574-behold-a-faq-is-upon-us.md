The new FAQ [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/ffg_content/lotr-lcg/support/LOTR_FAQ_1.2.pdf]is up. Mostly confirming what we had already heard from Nate.  The Quick Strike ruling makes sense to me, but seems to be a reversal.

Good, they have cleared up all the nonsense muddle concerning the questions around attacking twice...

Yay! It's about time.  And I like the rulings that were made - I think the scoring system change is simple (although it is one more thing to keep track of), and should solve the problem adequately.

In the article announcing the FAQ, Nate does state that the Quick Strike ruling is a reversal of the old ruling, but it is certainly something I can live with.

Finally this should put to rest the Eleanor issues, the Gandalf/Stand and Fight confusion, and the persistent Carrock question.

 

Still waiting for a detailed timing chart, but this'll make things flow a lot more smoothly, imo.

Some interesting stuff in here. I think a lot of people will be happy with these clarifications.

New scoring system is interesting... Have they cleared the quest log? The old scores will not be compatible with the new ones. :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

I don't see why they are messing about the scoring system. If some players "turtle" then that is a valid tactic and play style. Adding 10pts per turn is just silly.

Well, do you want a crowded GenCon LOTR Tourney where everyone is stalling and trying to get the lowest score that way? Would take forever. This scoring change is as much for the game itself as it is for the FFG peeps that would have to stand there waiting for the games to be over. It's easier to just add the 10 points per round than to have people standing around with stop watches and a time limit at tournaments.

My only issue with it is that now the scores I have in the Quest Log are probably delete worthy now. LEGACY SCORES!!!

Yeah, I'm trying to figure out what to do with my old scores. They really should mark them as legacy or something.

They could just delete them all. I would appreciate it :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
