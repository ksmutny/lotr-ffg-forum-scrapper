# [Dwarrowdelf cycle - skipping first two packs](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/279480-dwarrowdelf-cycle-skipping-first-two-packs/)

I saw a comment on a website about the different expansions to the LoTR:LCG Dwarrowdelf cycle saying that not buying the first two packs, The RedHorn Gate and Road to Rivendell would leave cards unused from the Khazad-dum deluxe expansion. Is this true?

I dont find the synopsis for the two expansions to be all that interesting so I was not planning on buying them. However, I've been waiting months (Months!) to get my hands on the cycle and would hate not being able to use all the cards from the Khazad-dum expansion and the cycle being sold out for a lifetime again by the time I realize it.

You would be missing out on some player cards for sure. The only really good card you would miss would be Rivendell Blade. The two Heroes from those packs are fun but were designed to be used together, so you're kinda only missing out on one thing there.

Out of the Wild is huge for Victory Display decks (an archetype that is developed later in the game).

Timely Aid is great in Secrecy decks, but not the only way to go in Secrecy decks.

The other player cards in those two packs range from okay/situational to outright bad.

If you imagine yourself wanting the full card pool some day, I wouldn't skip those packs if you can find them in stock. But if you are trying to be tactical about your choices, those are good packs to skip.

On the plus side, you'll never experience the horror that is Sleeping Sentry.  That's my second most hated card ever.  (I hate Power of Mordor more).

The first two packs in the AP are a separate trip than the last four packs, so it won't even harm the storyline significantly by skipping the first two packs.

Spirit Bofur from Redhorn Gate is one of my favorite spirit allies, as he can easily be cheated into play for one resource.  Lure of Moria from Road to Rivendell is amazingly powerful with a dwarven swarm, though if the swarm is already out you probably don't need the help.

Yes there is an encounter set that you would not use if you don't buy those 2 APs. But it is not a big deal. There is also plenty encounter set that you probably have to discover in the others cycle. And there are way better, both from scenario and player cards (to me cycle 2 is the worst part of the game, and those 2 are the worst part of the cycle 2 ^^). So continue your journey, you still can come back in some years to buy the missing part ;).

I actually think those 2 quests are pretty cool, Redhorn is still one of my favorites. To each their own

I agree on the power of mordor!

Yes, one of the encounter sets from Khazad-dum is only used in these two, and Watcher in the Water (which you should not skip). And yes, this cycle suffers from constant reprints, so If they restock, I would advise picking them up. They've got some solid player cards.

Any word on when Dwarrowdelf cycle will be back in stock? I have Khazad-dum and anxious to pick up the adventure packs.

Nope. We’ve been waiting for a while.
