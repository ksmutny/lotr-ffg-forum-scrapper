So hyped for Sword-Thain. When trying to think of uses for Defender of the West I kept thinking it'd be so much more useful if the ally could have attachments usually restricted to heroes. Now my dream will become a reality.

Sword-thain looks like an extremely good and abusable card. It costs 4 which can be a lot but having an extra hero that gathers resources can be huge in decks with low resource generation, and it is also a great way to smooth your resources (though then again, Resourceful can do pretty much the same thing without having to have a unique ally). In the Elrond Gandalf deck or any Elrond deck it can be extremely useful due to all the unique allies that deck uses and it's capability of playing expensive cards for free. In a hobbit deck as well it can be really good, since you'll probably use stuff like Elf-stone and Timely Aid to get big allies such as Beorn or Gildor into play. Having suddenly a Beorn or Gildor hero in a hobbit deck can be huge. Really really interesting and all around good card.

 

Other than that, I'm excited for that unique leadership weapon! Andúril maybe? They said it works with Gondor and Dúnedain.

Sword-Thain is brilliant. It opens up so many combos... Caldara for 3, Mithdrandir's Advice for 4, all the 4 cost event-repeaters for free, Dori with UC and Self-Preservation+Beorn... what an amazing card!

Bill the Pony... nice. Bofur can finally be a hero. Ally Gimli might make a better hero than hero Gimli.

With desperate alliance you could control 5 heroes. Your partner gives your mono lore deck Aragorn to reset threat and you cast mithrandir's advice to draw 5 while your at it. Not a bad deal.

Yes... Ally Faramir with various hero readying effects will be very powerful. Hefty startup cost though.

 

 

> Also... how does Landroval work?

 

I would think that after a card is destroyed its game text is not active. So if hero Landroval is destroyed, he cannot trigger his response and is just placed in the discard pile.

 

Lots of things to think about with this card.

## 22 [Seastan on July 11, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/182270-the-dread-realm/?do=findComment&comment=1688777)

Though I wonder... Could you use Rallying cry to return a Sword-Thain hero/ally after it leaves play? At what moment does it cease being a hero?

 

And for Defender of the West, does the card stop working after Sword-Thain is attached or do you keep passing your new hero around?

 

So many questions.

## 23 [pmdoug on July 11, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/182270-the-dread-realm/?do=findComment&comment=1688785)

Here's my idea for Sword-Thain:

 

Player 1 has Bifur, Erestor, X

Player 2 has Monospirit

 

Player 2 puts Emery into play for free. Bifur takes a resource from Player 2. Player 1 puts Sword-Thain (assuming they drew it with Erestor) on Emery. Assuming you get lucky with card draw, this is a pretty easy way to get an extra hero on round one. Emery can also be given to any player!

Just purely my gut reaction, but I'd say the moment that character is destroyed, it's returned to it's original state. I would agree that Defender of the West basically stops working on the ally it's attached to if you make it a hero. This is a crazy card though, can't wait to see what shenanigans this cycle throws out for us to use it with.

The manual says this: "as hero cards cannot move to a player’s hand or deck." (pg 20 under Hit Points and Damage)

 

Maybe this means you cannot trigger any effect that would move the card with Sword-Thain back into your hand or deck.  Or you could trigger it, but the part of the effect that would move the hero would just fail.

 

If this is correct, that would mean...

 

-Can't use Landroval's ability (the cost is to return him to your hand)

-Put Spirit Bofur into play via his Quest Action, then somehow manage to get Sword-Thain onto him (Vilya) and he will stay in play regardless of quest outcome

-Put an expensive ally into play via Sneak Attack or a dwarf via To Me! O My Kinsfolk!, then give them Sword-Thain and they will remain in play.  Or Gwaihir's Response could accomplish the same thing for Landroval.  Very nice for ally Beorn because then....

-Trigger ally Beorn's action without having to shuffle him into your deck

Wouldn't the new hero be unable to spend resources on non-neutral cards since it doesn't gain a resource icon of any sphere? Allies have sphere of influence icons (core set pg 8) and not resource icons. Clearly the intent of the card is to have the hero gain a resource icon since they describe using it in the article but it doesn't seem to actually state that a resource icon is gained

The article uses the Theoden as an example of effect that would benefit from turning somebody into the hero, so it's safe to assume that turned heroes not just have a resource icon - they have a printed resource icon.

I am personally most excited about that: "Spirit Song that recalls the lay of Beren and Lúthien to encourage stronger alliances between the region's Dúnedain and Noldor."

The reclaiming of Silmaril by those two is one of the most iconic moments in all LotR lore and estranging of Elves and Men is one of the saddest things. So a card that reminds of the last alliance and that in the beginning those two races fought together is thematic gem and I cannot wait to build "forces of the north" decks to build around it. 

## 31 [gandalfDK on July 11, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/182270-the-dread-realm/?do=findComment&comment=1688955)

Omg! Freaking amazing. A whole new Middle-Earth just opened!

Weatherstained cloak looks interesting and the Lay of Beren and Luthien does too.

Sword-thain. W.t.f. Brok will finally become a hero. Gimli ally, legolas ally, boromir ally, Beorn ally, Quickbeam ally. So many great possibilities. UC, Self-preservation, a lot of weapons etc. Two new slots for your restricted cards. Awesome stuff. Sadly they made Hobbit Gandalf and Treebeard and Radagast unavailable.

Just for the sake of the question, would ally Gandalf still leave play at the end of the rround? Because you apparantly can trigger Beorn without shuffling him back.

## 32 [PsychoRocka on July 11, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/182270-the-dread-realm/?do=findComment&comment=1688962)

The last pack looks downright epic! The encounter art, especially on possession and dwimmerlaik (awesome name too!!!), is just amazing and the few player cards we've seen are great. Sword-thain is super interesting and opens up many new combos or strategies. I for one am looking forward to putting it on ally Legolas allowing you to put more than just a Rivendell Blade on him weapon wise and turning him into an epic slayer drawing you many cards whilst slaying! There are definitely better or more complex uses for it however such as Beorn ally listed above. Tale of Tinuviel sounds epic and for anyone using decks that feature a mix of Noldor and Dunedain heroes or allies could be a really great card! That tactics Dunedain ally looks great and in multiplayer if the most combat dedicated player is using them they could have as high as 3 or 4 attack quite regularly. Having Ranged, the Ranger trait and 3 hitpoints are all very nice as well. Heir of Valandil could see you playing this ally for free or at least just 1 if you are engaged with 3 or 3 enemies respectively. Weather Stained Cloak looks like it could be really great even at 0 cost. It is limit 1 per character and must be attached to a ranger character. Maybe it can be discarded to cancel a shadow effect just revealed? Perhaps it stops the attached character from taking damage from encounter card effects? Similar to Star Broach but stops nasty treacheries that do direct damages to all questing, exhausted or whatever characters. I'm really curious to see what this card and the Tale of Tinuviel card do!
The quest sounds really great and the reanimated mechanic is very clever. Sounds like it will be pretty **** hard though. Even the encounter icon is super badass!!

As for the quest - yeah, I'm glad they have finally used that long forgotten orc sentry from the tower mechanic from the Escape from the Dol Guldur. And also improved it (now, they actually have a trait).

## 34 [PsychoRocka on July 11, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/182270-the-dread-realm/?do=findComment&comment=1688972)

With the Boromir Ally if you put Sword Thain on him you can put Gondorian Shield on him putting him on 3 defense instead of 1 or a whopping 5 if his ability kicks in! Chuck an unexpected courage on him or always put archery/treachery damage on him and he would be a bit of a beast in combat providing great defense and 3 attack. Also the extra tactics resource obviously.

## 35 [Olorin93 on July 11, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/182270-the-dread-realm/?do=findComment&comment=1688974)

This pack looks fun. Sword-Thain can be game-changing in the right deck, but I remain unconvinced e.g. Beorn's ability can be triggered if you don't go through with shuffling him back. Will be interesting to see a ruling on this.

 

edit: Because if this is actually the case, there is no way I won't run him and 3x Sword-Thain in a Vilya deck.

Well, shuffling him back into the deck is not a cost, so he is going to get that +5 attack no doubt. Dunno how they're going to handle shuffling into the deck part. 

 

Manual says that heroes can't go into the decks or hands, but we have:

 

Lost-and-Alone.png [https://s3.amazonaws.com/hallofbeorn-resources/Images/Cards/Foundations-of-Stone/Lost-and-Alone.png]

 

And remember that golden rule? Card text always trumpts rulebook. So, unfortunately, I think Beorn ally-hero will actually go back into the player deck.

My vote for: Exhaust Weatherstained cloak to draw a card after you engage an enemy.

I feel like Weatherstained Cloak is going to protect the wearer from the treacheries or something.

I also think that Beorn ally/hero would be discarded after trigerring his efect. Would be nice to know the official answer.

 

Weatherstained Cloak? Action: Exhaust Weatherstained Cloak to choose 1 non-unique enemy in staging area. Players ignore that enemy during engagement checks.

Anduril wouldn't make sense outside of the LotR saga, because in the regular timeline of the game the sword is still broken.

 

On the Sword-Thain discussion, I'm pretty sure any effect that would cause the new hero to leave play would still go off, and thus discard Sword-Thain.

The odd question I'm wondering about now is: if you attach Sword-Thain to a unique Dwarf, who then leaves play, can you put Brok Ironfist into play for free or not? Does it still count as a Dwarf hero leaving play if they stop being a hero when they leave play?

It seems to me that when the hero-ally dies Sword Thain falls off and then both cards go to the normal discard pile because the hero-ally is simply an ally again.

PocketWraith - you are right about Anduril not making sense in the time frame of the game, but that's true of so many cards we already have.

You're probably right about Anduril, but I still hope we'll see it at some point. Probably the weapon in the pack will be a generic "Sword of the West" or something like that.

I think you're right and it will end up being that Sword-Thain heroes can go into your hand/deck as per usual.  I keep thinking about it though, and then I think of Will of the West.  If it was as simple as the golden rule, Will of the West would move a discarded hero into your deck.  And you could use cards like Dwarven Tomb or Ered Nimrais Prospector to move a discarded hero into your hand or deck (dunno why you would want to do this).  Will of the West is the real problem, because you move the entire discard pile. I do not think it is supposed to move a hero.... because they ignore effects that move heroes to hands/decks.

 

If we observe that, then Sword-Thain also can't move heroes to hand/deck.  But neither could Lost and Alone, and we know that one can, so..... it's a circle.  Either I'm missing something, or we have no way to explain why Will of the West wouldn't move heroes to your deck, while Lost and Alone can.

I think you are looking for this, on p20 or the rulebook:

 

>  
> 
> When resolving effects that move cards from a player’s discard pile to his hand or deck, hero cards in the discard pile are ignored, as hero cards cannot move to a player’s hand or deck.

## 47 [GrandSpleen on July 12, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/182270-the-dread-realm/?do=findComment&comment=1689892)

Yeah that's what I quoted earlier in the thread, but the "cannot" part at the end would see to suggest that Lost and Alone shouldn't work.

## 48 [Seastan on July 12, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/182270-the-dread-realm/?do=findComment&comment=1689935)

The Golden Rule applies when there is a direct contradiction between the rulebook and the card. This happens with Lost and Alone, so you ignore the rulebook and follow the text on the card. However with WotW there is no contradiction, as the rulebook specifies what happens when an effect would shuffle a hero in the discard pile back into the deck. So it is possible to resolve both effects without contradiction.

 

Similar to how Legolas (Core) works. If Legolas kills an enemy it says to put 2 progress on the current quest. However the rulebook says progress must be placed on an active location before being placed on the quest. This is not a contradiction, because the rulebook explains what to do if such an effect would place progress on the current quest while there is an active location (it is placed on the active location instead). So it is possible to resolve both effects without contradiction.

 

If Legolas said "Place 2 progress on the current quest, bypassing the active location" then the Golden Rule would apply.

 

If WotW said, "Shuffle your discard pile, including heroes, back into your deck" then the Golden Rule would apply.

And by that logic, if a hero card said, "shuffle this card into your deck" you would follow what the card says. Thus Beorn would be shuffled into your deck.

Weird as it sounds, the most interesting part of Sword-Thain to me is how it would work in a secrecy deck. 

 

I mean, yeah, I know--secrecy never really worked but some of those cards really ARE very powerful. This could allow you to run two heroes to keep your threat low, sneak in a heavy hitter (and you SHOULD have a way of sneaking in a heavy-hitter if you are running secrecy), play this and BAM--you are back at three heroes. If you can pull of a resourceful as well then all the better. 

 

The biggest problem would just be maintaining sufficient card-draw to get all the pieces together before the Encounter deck can build up too much.

It's interesting to note that Sneak Attack specifies that the ally must still be in play in order to shuffle it, but that still requires a 5 resource investment from 2 heroes in order to set up which sounds a bit unreliable to me. If you can come up with a way that doesn't require to many cards to draw and is cheaper, let me know.

By the way, a Spirit hero in this pack: I now think Círdan. There is a Dúnedain hero in the previous deck, there probably won't be two in a row.

I had thought the formerly (partly) previewed Tale of Tinúviel would be the card mentioned in pack 5 but now we have it here. Synergy between Dúnedain and Noldor: I hope that is a powerful card.

Weapon for Gondor and Dúnedain: super-excited about that one as well.

 

I wish they spoiled us a bit more.

And isn't Fornost Bowman just fantastic? Not only Tactics doesn't usually get willpower on non-unique allies (maybe Dúnedain will be the exception -- the Hunter and Bowman both have 1 willpower), he gets 1 attack printed, and how easy it is to boost it up to 3? Even with non-Dúnedain Tactics decks, you will want to engage an enemy optionally, and another might jump at you due to your high threat (not to mention left-overs from previous rounds). In Dúnedain decks, with Forest Snare, this ally should almost always be worth it. Right now I believe Fornost Bowman can rival the superb Galadhon Archer in their respective roles and decks.

Well, I'm nost that optimistic about Fornost Bowman. It's kinda wierd for a ranged character to rely his damage source on engaged enemies. Galadhon Archer comes 1 resource cheaper, 2 attack instantly (3 if Celeborn is in play) and also deals 1 damage instantly, kinda hard to beat that in my opinion.

He's got a boatload of health, but yeah, not much else. Having to use Forest Snare doesn't really make him more appealing really at all, because that's 6 resources from two spheres. Maybe I'll have a heaping helping of crow later, but I sort of doubt it.

## 59 [John Constantine on July 13, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/182270-the-dread-realm/?do=findComment&comment=1690915)

3 health on attacking character is only good in quests with direct damage. Well, maybe some more Dunedian synergy will improve him, but right now I percieve him as a decent card, but nothing else.

## 60 [Raven1015 on July 13, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/182270-the-dread-realm/?do=findComment&comment=1690972)

Well, he's a Dunedain piece basically. So if you're already using Forest Snare, for example, to activate Halbarad, Sarn Ford Sentry, etc., then it's not really 6 for the Snare/Fornost combo because the Snare is working with a bunch of different effects, not just the Bowman. In such a deck, let's say you have 2 engaged enemies, maybe one brought in during planning with Dunedain Hunter, then the Bowman could be 1 cost with Heir of Valandil with 3 attack. As for his hit points, it seems like almost every quest these days has some archery or direct damage, so the more hit points the better.

I must admit that I am less excited about traps than I was at the time of HoN and the Against the Shadow cycle. With so much archery in the game, I feel like traps are more of a sideboard strategy - otherwise you risk having a deck that plays right into the hands of the encounter deck. One way for the designers to address this would be to create a trap card that removes the Archery keyword from the attached enemy. Without something like that, I would hesitate to call any trap-based deck a general purpose solution. It is an interesting archetype, but one that I avoid completely for many recent quests.

I agree with Beorn. If traps were already rather weak in the AtS cycle, new enemies with archery and "cannot have attachments" invalidate them almost completely. They'll have to do a hell of a job in case they want to make them viable.

I haven't built a good Dúnedain deck yet, so I am not so sure about that. But Beravor, Halbarad, Tactics Aragorn may not be too bad. Though it is true, I would rather see another Lore or Leadership Dúnedain hero there instead of Tactics. One card that works very well in these Dúnedain decks is Tighten Our Belts. You cannot play much on round 1 anyway, so you save the resources and then every hero has three in the beginning of round 2. Then again, the round 1 will be very hard no matter what with the Dúnedain (at least as I see them now). Much easier in coop -- I mean to find a good deck to work with it.

 

I am saying this without experience but I still believe it shouldn't be very hard to have this guy at 3 attack, and for 3 resources, that is very good. Plus, a Tactics non-unique ally with willpower is always good to see.

I am very sad how weak the traps and the whole Ranger of Ithilien strategy is. I had been hoping for a serious power-contender there, with direct damage into the staging area as a real alternative to standard combat. I still have hopes this may turn around with the Land of Shadow, but the hope is very faint.

Honestly, I would play BOTH. Secrecy decks require consistency so you should have a way of making use of dead cards if you draw into a copy of one of them when you can't use it and Resourceful is ALWAYS worth it's secrecy cost (..okay not ALWAYS, but pretty close).

No Bowman because he hasn't been released yet (indeed, at the time he hadn't even been spoiled), but I have a deck with Elrond/Halbarad/Merry(Sp) using Forest Snares for Dunedain effects which beat Nightmare Foundations of Stone last week. I think I got pretty luck on enconuter draws, but still. I also tried it against Nightmare Steward's Fear. Lost that one, but I survived a decent way past the first couple of turns, which is all you asked for.

So I'd say it's doable. Since Elrond can pay for all allies, I could just drop the Bowman straight into that deck and it'd probably work not much differently to how it does now.

This. 

 

As someone who tries to build general-purpose decks to go up against any scenario I feel like that really holds me back from this deck archetype. Which is sad because it's been getting a lot of focus and looks like it's set to get a lot more soon.

Jokes aside, I wouldn't mind her having the response John Constantine's custom made hero card had: "When Arwen commits to a quest, ready another Hero committed to that quest". I've been playing around using a proxy of that card and really like that ability. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

What do you think of...

 

Arwen

Spirit Hero

6 Starting Threat

2 Willpower

0 Attack

1 Defense

3 Hitpoints

 

While Arwen is exhausted, other heroes you control get +1 willpower, +1 defense and +1 attack.

 

Too strong? Not strong enough? Readying her would be pointless as it would stop her boosting your other heroes.

The stat boost could make other heroes that are usually not so great at questing/attacking/defending more suitable for that role at the cost (in a way) of a hero slot. Low threat could be good for secrecy (so is the stat boost as secrecy decks tend to have weaker lower starting threat heroes) and she could be a decent replacement for Glorfindel in some decks (still providing 2 willpower to his 3 but potentially giving you another point or two if you commit your other two heroes).  What do you think?

Hey folks, I just had a brilliant idea for Arwen hero, check this out:

 

Arwen Undomiel

Spirit

Starting Threat: 5

Willpower: 2

Attack: 0

Defense: 1

Health: 2

 

Noldor. Noble.

 

Response: After Arwen Undomiel exhausts, choose a character. That character gains sentinel and +1 Defense until the end of the round.

I don't like other non-hobbit heroes to have starting threat lower than a hobbit's.  Like Spirit Glorfindel (5), which is lower than hobbits'.  Hobbits are supposed to be master of stealth and going unnoticed.  That's why Bilbo was hired as a "burglar" and Frodo and Sam were able to sneak into Mordor.  Hobbits should have the lowest starting threats, next would be ranger heroes.

## 79 [Teamjimby on August 26, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/182270-the-dread-realm/?do=findComment&comment=1756656)

Agreed.  If it is Arwen, I would want her to have 7 threat.  Other than Galadriel, they have never given a hero 0 attack or defense (Merry doesn't count) and only Hobbits have had 2 hp.  So the minimum stat line is probably 2/1/1/3 for 7 threat.  That would be my preference, but there could potentially be a third willpower.

They should totally release an anti-Sword-thain attachment! Attached hero loses the hero subtype and gains ally! It would make several Druadan Forest effects easier to stomach! And then we could attach Defender of the West!

It's slang from Magic: The Gathering for cards/effects that blow up everything. The card "Wrath of God" destroys all creatures in Magic, so any effect that wipes out (or even damages) all allies in LotR would be similar.
