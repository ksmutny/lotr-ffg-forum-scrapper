I haven't seen a new piece from Magali this cycle. She illustrated the new Éowyn for Flame of the West, but that might have been done months ago. Is she still working on the LotR LCG?

I may be wrong, but I think she said she will no longer draw for FFG.

What about artworks of AH LCG?

She did Roland Banks, so it'd seem so!

That doesn't mean much. All other investigator artworks are from Eldritch Horror and Roland just may be included in the Dreamlands expansion. FFG could commission it before and decided to use it in AH LCG first.

Any specific reason?

I wouldn't be surprised if WotC picked her up with an offer FFG couldn't match. She's in high demand now I would imagine.

She's a free agent. She has worked for both WotC and FFG at the same time in the past. All Wizards can do is shower her with so much work that she doesn't have time to do anything else.

I have noticed a lot more of her artwork on Magic cards lately.

yea, I think that is the case as well.  Hopefully they can still get her for some cards here and there but they do have plenty of really good artists working for them.

Oh, that sucks big time. Her art is simply the best in the game. I suppose WotC can afford to pay her more, and that art is worth every penny!

Maybe they could pick up Fernanda Suarez from PHG? God, her art is beautiful.

Not really a fan of that particular card/piece you posted but I just went to her deviant art and yeah she is very talented indeed!

Would be very cool to see art from her in our game!!

FTR we've had this discussion before and then she's popped back up again. (Magali)

Yeah very sad she's not doing as much stuff, but I wouldn't say she's never doing art for us again. She just did Eowyn (T). She's probably able to increase what she charges now since she's gotten so popular (thanks a lot Cardboard of the Rings!...)

Hearsay: someone actually talked with Ms. Villeneuve today while getting LotR cards signed, and she said she still draws for FFG. Take that FWIW.

Shes just great, I want more of her art on the FFG cards I buy :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Maybe Wotc can get her to do some of their d&d artwork. All the 5e art looks like it's been painted by blind chimps.

I'm certainly a fan, but her art can feel a bit "samey" if that makes sense. Not including her as much might help to lessen the homogeneity of the art.
