Hi!
Playing Nightmare quests so using a dwarf deck with Longbeard Elder.

When I tap the Elder can I immediately (before committing more characters) look at the top card?

This is the way I have been playing it and it feels super powerful knowing what is coming (when playing solo).

 

Thanks in advance

Mårten

i guess no .. you commit all of your characters simultainously.. after that you trigger responses.

Yeah, you commit all your characters at the same time - however in multiplayer any players after you in the sequence could act based on that knowledge (but then of course in multiplayer you're revealing more cards so the scry is less powerful).

Thanks for answering.

Been playing it wrong, I should have known it was too strong

It is similar than than Theodred-Aragorn leadership. You can ready Aragorn's response because you commit both heroes simultaniosly. Otherway, you couldn't. If you quest first Theodred, and after Aragorn, you can't give the resource to Aragorn, so he can't trigger his own response. And if you quest Aragorn and after Theodred, it is late to trigger Aragorn's response.

You can play 

Longbeard Elder

 with an event like Late adventurer or such.
