Can I pull a monster which is already engaged with a another player? or the monster will stay engaged with the player until death?

 

I know we can with a card, return the monster to the staging area, feint, etc.

You can't...the rules only allow you to engage an enemy from the staging area.  But you say, you can use a card effect to engage an enemy that is engaged with another player (Son of Arnor, tactics Aragorn, Westfold Outfider).
