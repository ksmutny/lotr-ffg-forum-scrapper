# [Quest of riddles passing 2b to 3a](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/92860-quest-of-riddles-passing-2b-to-3a/)

The questi is from Dungeon Deep and Caverns Dim, of The Hobbit: Over Hill and Under Hill. When you pass to 3b:

Text says: When Revealed: The first player gains control of Bilbo Baggins. reveal 1 encounter card per player and add it to the staging área.

 

You passed to 3a by winning riddles, the first card you revealed in past round had a riddle and you won, so you reveal 3a, and after 3b.

How many cards must you reveal still? (if you play with other friend, total 2 players?)

 

And other question: if you won by winning the first riddle of this card....

Its text says: When Revealed: The first player must choose to answer the riddle on this card. If he finds at least 1 match, discard cards from the encounter deck until another card with a riddle is discarded. Then, answer that riddle.

What must you do? Search for new riddle even useless? Must i do the riddle? Instead must i reveal it in staging? While i'm looking for the riddle card, other cards go into play?

Here's my take:

 

If you flip to 3B as the result of a riddle, you'll still have to finish the staging step.  Staging would not be cancelled -- under "Quest Advancement" near the end of the game manual, it states that the round sequence is not interrupted by flipping a quest card.  Not exactly what we are talking about here, but it's as good a direct as I can find.  In a 2 player game, it would look like:
 

- Reveal first card for staging.  

- Answer riddle.

- Flip to 3B

- Reveal 1 card per player as a result of 3B's "When Revealed" effect

- Reveal second card for staging

- Quest resolution

 

So, progress from quest resolution would be placed on 3B, and you could WIN 3B as a result of that questing phase if you have enough quest power.

 

If the riddle that you answered came from It Likes Riddles, I think you should still discard until you find the next Riddle effect -- then ignore it.  The text on 3B would have you ignore the Riddle effect itself, but wouldn't do anything to disrupt the "search" effect from the When Revealed text of It Likes Riddles. 

 

But what order to resolve effects?  I think you would completely resolve It Likes Riddles before resolving the When Revealed text on 3B, but I am not sure.  So: 1) reveal the first card for staging, 2) answer riddle, 3) place progress and flip to 3B, 4) do the discard per the text on It Likes Riddles but ignore the Riddle effect, 5) then reveal 2 cards per 3B's text, 6) then reveal the second card to finish the staging step.  But I am not sure whether (4) and (5) should be done in the opposite order, and I would like to hear others' thoughts!

Ok, thanks for your answer.

 

Another question i forgot in my ask:

 

1a text says: Forced: Reveal 1 additional encounter card per player during the staging step.

...then, even if you pass to 3a, must you reveal additional cards by 1a step text?

In the example of this post, it would be 3 more cards! Isn't? The forced of 1a is active still even if you have just pass to 3a?

The Forced effect would have to trigger.  You determine how many cards to reveal during the beginning of staging, so even if you flip over to card 3 in the middle of the staging step, the number of cards to be revealed has already been determined.

 

Yep, they drown you in cards in this quest :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

If it is so, can you still chose the riddle test even if you are in 3a?

No, once you flip to 3A, its text will be active, and you have to ignore riddle effects.  The way I am seeing it, you'd still have to do the search effect from It Likes Riddles, but you have to ignore the riddle effect itself.

Ok, thanks. I understand now.
