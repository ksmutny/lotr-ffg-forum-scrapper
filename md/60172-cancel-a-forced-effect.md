 Hi All,

 After trying Return to Mirkwood solo I got frustrated at Gollum's effect of raising the threat by an extra 3 every turn.  So I thought is there a way to avoid it?  I can't think of anything that allows you to cancel something that's 'forced'.  Is this possible at all?

For Gollum, since he is still a encounter card effect, Elfhelm can lower the total threat increase from 4 to 3, but no way to cancel AFAIK (which is true for most/all? Forced).

 Ah yes, Elfhelm would help.  Thanks.
