I'm sure this has been brought up before, but it seems especially intriguing now with the newest contract, the three hunters. Basically with something like war axe which requires a tactics symbol, can Gandalf play it on himself since in that moment he has all the symbols, OR do attachments need legal targets beforehand to be played?

He can attach them to himself â€” enjoy your shenanigans!
