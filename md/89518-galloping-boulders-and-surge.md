Does the added surge effect (from a stone-giant in the staging area) trigger if the card is revealed from the encounter discard pile?

The FAQ states to trigger surge, doomed and guarded only when revealed from the encounter deck but does not state discard pile.

I ask because I had a galloping boulders during staging step which revealed a suspicious crow from it surge effect, bringing galloping boulders back. Should I trigger another surge from the galloping boulders when it is brought from the discard pile by the crows?

Thanks,

mmm...not sure. i would say yes otherwise the effects forcing you to put treachery cards from the discard pile would lose much of their effects

i have played it this way, dont have a source though....

I'm sure the when revealed effects still trigger so having them come from the discard pile is still effective, just not sure about the passive effects. I have looked but couldn't find a source that really says one way or the other.

I also believe that the when revealed triggers even from discard pile

I think we already discussed a similar problem in another thread. I think the conclusion was that surge won't trigger if the card was not revealed from the encounter deck.

I concur with the above. In the absence of any definitive word, we have to go with the FAQ entry that states the keywords only trigger when a card is revealed from the encounter deck. Thus, the "when revealed" effect of Galloping Boulders triggers when it is brought back from the discard pile but not the surge.

That was what I thought too and that's how I played it. Thanks all.
