How will the timing work on Caldara and the new Prince Imrahil?

 

If I have Prince Imrahil in play and I choose to discard Caldara to trigger her ability, does Prince Imrahil count as a hero before caldara checks for how many Spirit Heroes I have in play?  Or does Caldara's ability have to resolve completely before Imrahil turns into a hero?

Going by the text I think the number of other Spirit heroes you control is determined at the time you trigger the action, before Caldara reaches the discard pile, so Imrahil doesn't count.

Going by sensible game balance it definitely should work that way because if Imrahil + Sword-thain (on a different ally) got us the ability to Caldara for four allies at a time then that would be broken as hell.

1 more makes it broken?  after spending 9 resources on a Sword-thain+Unique combo?

## 7 [PocketWraith on July 19, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/225345-gather-strength/?do=findComment&comment=2317637)

It's pushing at broken being able to do it for three allies with Sword-thain. You better believe getting it to four would be broken.

## 8 [Slothgodfather on July 19, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/225345-gather-strength/?do=findComment&comment=2317654)

Yhere is so much you have to work for to get to that point that I don't feel the 1 extra is going in the extreme at all.  In order to matter, you'd have to already have 4 good allies in your discard pile, a unique out and sword thain on them as well as Prince Imrahil out.  That is a LOT of resources and turn management.  The payoff better be powerful, and 4 allies is just that.   But, things being OP or Broken are completely subjective terms, so we shall carry on regardless.

 

 

The only real question remains - when does Imrahil convert?   And from the other Flame in the West thread [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/218379-flame-of-the-west-new-saga/page-9#entry2317599] and this one, it doesn't seem anyone is too sure about it.

You could push it to seven with four players and Desperate Alliance.

 

Spending 8+ resources and discarding at least four useful allies seems a significant cost to get four "free" spirit allies at the expense of a hero.  Powerful effect, but not immediate and not auto-win.

Sterner than Steel: Fantastic, maybe even better than Hasty Stroke. Just a Gondorian Shield and you are good to go :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Golden Shield: Ok, most defenders have low willpower. Could be used as a back-up plan on someone like eowyn (but she couldn't quest in tis case). Nor am i a stranger still won't be played :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] But it actually might make someone like Elfhelm with his balanced stats a really solid Defender.

Livery of the Tower: Poor man's Blood of Numenorß Actually rhich man's as this looks really expensive to be payed repeadetly. Could be used i cases of extreme direct damage and no Access to lore.

Desperate Defense: Behind strong walls for Spirit Beregond? The Cards look really similiar. I would say it's pretty safe to use with 6 defense.

Price Imrahil: Maybe Play him for his stats, but I don't think anyone will plan on loosing a hero right away from the start. You could sneak attack him in first round and then kill of someone like Spirit merry to Keep the same amount of heroes but get an upgrade on stats :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Spirit Beregond: This Saga Expansion! First we get a 4 willpower tactics hero and now we get a 0 willpower Spirit hero, crazy times :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] He has to compete with his tactics Version, but I don't see a clear winner. The cost reduction is really nice especially at the beginning, but the repeatable threat reduction can be awesome in the Long run. you could tank a weak enemy forever to stay out of Engagement range, help others to not threat out or with the help of Galadriel lower your threat by 1 each turn!

 

The heroes of Flame of the West look amazing! And the other playercards are mosly nice to great additions so far. I love Saga expansions <3

 

Edit: What's up with the Rohan tactics ally? My Money is on Eomer, maybe Theoden. Both have tactics heroes, but that didn't stop Legolas. All other important Rohan characters already have thier ally form or come as a hero in this box^^

haha hadn't thought of that. Combined with the discarding of Noldor, this could be an awesome strategy. The biggest problem would be making sure that everybody else had the card at the exact same time.  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

This is a quality group of cards, but perhaps more flashy than effective.

 

Sterner Than Steel is a pretty nice card.  A long time coming for Tactics.  Nice that it works with both weapons and armor, gives it a leg up on stuff like Foe-hammer.

 

Golden Shield seems like kind of a trap.  It's obviously a huge effect on Eowyn and Tactics Theoden.  Most other Rohan heroes have rather low willpower, so it's not doing as much.  Also only useful on one attack per turn, so it doesn't really help make a super defender.  Best case is probably throw it on Elfhelm with an Armored Destrier for up to 5 def, 6 if you give him Spirit.  I wonder if you are generally just better off sticking with stuff that provides a reliable boost.  You're only really getting a strong benefit from this if you have another attachment on the hero or if it's someone who should probably be questing.

 

Livery of the Tower will generally be worse than Blood of Numenor.  It's basically the balanced version, as BoN should really be Restricted.  It is better than BoN when you only have one resource.  Natural combo with The Day's Rising.  Also protects against direct damage, so there are some quests where Livery + Steward will be a valuable trick. 

 

Desperate Defense should be an Action rather than a Response.  Being forced to play it before you see the Shadow effect really sucks.  There are generally better combat tricks available unless you are mono-spirit.  Reminds me of hero Dori, as a similar effect that comes pre-nerfed.  Not free, Sentinel only, bad timing.

Even if Imrahil doesn't add to Caldara's ability, he's still absolutely stellar with her, effectively mitigating the cost of discarding a hero. He's pretty solid altogether, a nice emergency outlet for when things go bad. Probably should have 4hp though.  Unless you are losing heroes a lot, he's generally worse than Ranger of Cardolan.

 

Spirit Beregond is great.  I would say he's better than the Tactics version.  Hopefully they start printing some more Gondor allies in Spirit, the current crop is rather mediocre.

You can only do one Desperate Alliance per phase (There was a ruling a while back that any event which says Limit 1 per phase should really be like The Tree People since as written it's meaningless).

 

And what I'm getting from your other comments is that I guess neither of you has played or observed a good Caldara deck. I'll try to explain this though explanations don't necessarily substitute for experience (and my experience involved beating a variety of nightmare quests even before hero Arwen and Sword-thain were released).

 

> There is so much you have to work for to get to that point that I don't feel the 1 extra is going in the extreme at all.  In order to matter, you'd have to already have 4 good allies in your discard pile, a unique out and sword thain on them as well as Prince Imrahil out.  That is a LOT of resources and turn management.  The payoff better be powerful, and 4 allies is just that.

This is a false equivalence. The payoff for having played (or put into play with Caldara) Imrahil and another unique ally is that those allies are in play. They're already worth the resources you paid for them (or the resources you paid for Fortune or Fate). Sword-thain not so much, but it is generating resources for you and making Map of Earnil free. So at most you've paid the 4 resources for Sword-thain to get this set up, and it refunds those over time. Getting allies into your discard pile is also not that difficult with effects like Eowyn/Arwen/Mirror of Galadriel (not all three in the same deck obviously), and the real workhorse of the Caldara deck, Zigil Miner.

Ally Imrahil already removes the downside of discarding Caldara that you lose out on her resources, making it harder to pay for Fortune or Fate so you can do it again. Letting him also give you an extra ally every time you do it? Bearing in mind that I've had games where I discarded and revived Caldara once every two rounds or so on average (and again this was pre-Arwen), that's quite a few additional allies. To the point where I would definitely not bet against that Caldara deck getting literally all of its allies (barring uniqueness clashes) on the table by the end of a long enough game.

Isn't it ironic that Beregond has an effect that triggers when he doesn't take damage and yet his artwork shows him having taken damage?

Much to say, but Sterner than Steel is a card that Tactics has deserved since the core set.

## 16 [Estel Edain on July 20, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/225345-gather-strength/?do=findComment&comment=2317809)

So the player cards for Flame of the West (with a bit of speculation) are:

Aragorn (Fellowship, 1)
Éowyn (Tactics, 2)
Beregond (Spirit, 3)
 
? (almost certainly Tactics Rohan ally, likely Éomer, 4)
Imrahil (Spirit, 5)
? (perhaps Leadership ally, 6)
? (perhaps Lore ally, 7)
Sterner than Steel (Tactics, 8)
Desperate Defence (Spirit, 9)
Golden Shield (Tactics, 10)
Livery of the Tower (Spirit, 11)
? (likely attachment, 12)
? (perhaps Fellowship attachment, 13)
Esquire of Rohan (boon)
Esquire of Gondor (boon)
 
The numbering (with Golden Shield as the first attachment) suggests that Tactics appears first for each card type (except hero, where Aragorn is first). That would mean there are only two events, and likely 4 allies and 4 attachments. Since the first preview mentioned Dunedain, we'll likely see Halbarad (though he could be either Leadership or Lore). Éomer, who was unscathed together with Aragorn and Imrahil and who hasn't yet appeared in the saga, is quite likely. He's probably the Tactics ally, although it's possible that he's Leadership, Merry's Tactics, and Halbarad's Lore. There are several possibilities for the fourth ally: Merry (with Pippin in the last box), Lore Denethor ally, one of the twins (seems unlikely, but could work if the other twin appeared in the last saga box), or any of the other commanders in the battle of Pellenor Fields (Rohan or Gondor/Outlands -- but not with the Outlands trait).
 
I hope the Fellowship attachment is Elendil's standard, sewed by Arwen.

I like how Beregond can reduce other player's threat when he successfully defends for them. Shame it's only once per round. But a 4 Defense hero with no Willpower for Spirit and previously we saw Eowyn for Tactics, man the sphere bleed is real with this Saga expansion. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

I've not played or observed a good Caldara deck.  I plan on trying out a probably-not-so-good Caldara deck in the not so distant future (Eowyn/Caldara/Arwen in one deck, Elfhelm/Dori/Amarthiul in the other -- and mounts for everybody...), and I can see Imrahil being awesome with Caldara.  I probably won't be beating a variety of nightmare quests with it.

 

Still, there's no particular shortage of good decks that have beaten a variety of nightmare quests, or that can become absolutely overpowering by the end of a long enough game.  I've gotten all my allies from a Three Rings deck on the table, for example.  What I question is not that this will be very powerful with Caldara, but that it is *broken* with Caldara.  For "broken", I want to see a Caldara deck that will take the hardest part of most quests -- the beginning -- and curb-stomp it most of the time, solo.  I think it'd be a very rare game where you get the combo out on the second round, and until you hit the combo combat heavy quests will be a problem.

I guess it sort of becomes a substitute for Burning Brand; you can use Livery to cancel any damage that might accidentally kill Gloin. You still take as much damage as you can handle, you just have to cancel the excess.

What I'm not clear on is when I would use Livery over Blood of Numenor. Anyone have any concrete examples? (I guess maybe Gloin insurance is one, are there others?)

But Blood isn't unique, restricted, or limit 1 per hero.

These are some SERIOUSLY awesome cards.....

Regardless of Limit once per turn, Spirit Beregond is so **** cool. Not only do we finally have an epic defender in spirit but he can reduce threat pretty reliably/regularly. His ability is definitely as spirit as can be so even though his stats might not really fit spirit and he sort of bleeds into other spheres his ability sort of makes up for this and ensures he does stay true to his sphere whilst also doing something very new and unique for spirit. 

Ally version of Imrahil is just fantastic.... 4 cost for 2/2/2/3 is already a decent enough deal and he has the Gondor trait so can easily be pumped up to better stats (3/3/2/3 is most likely with Leadermir and Visionary Leadership). His ability is sort of just the cherry on top. In any game where you DO lose a hero he steps in and completely eliminates any resource loss you would incur and can then also receive hero only attachments and buffs and whatnot. In any game where you do not lose a hero he is still a great ally with very nice stats that will most likely only have boosted stats in any Gondor deck. He is also great with Caldara as any time she is in your discard pile he is generating resources and can receive hero only buffs/attachments, then when you bring her back he goes back to being an ally but can keep any of those attachments he received and if you then discard her additional times he will step up to hero status each time you do taking away most of the drawback of having to sacrifice her (resource generation, one less spirit hero, loss of stats).

 

Then we have these four new AMAZING cards for defense. My favourite is easily Sterner than Steel. FINALLY some shadow control/cancellation that is actually useful.... first Armoured Destrier which is an epic card and now Sterner than Steel. Both are on a similar level to Hasty Stroke and Burning Brand in my opinion. 

To me personally this makes up for cards like Staff of Lebethron, Silver Lamp, Shadows Give Way etc which to me are either extremely subpar shadow control cards or are extremely niche and only useful in very specific deck builds. 

Sterner than Steel is essentially just Hasty Stroke in tactics with a cost of 0 instead of 1 but you need an armour or weapon attachment on the defending character. Now so long as you are running a deck where your defender receives multiple armour or weapon attachments and you are running tactics this card is VASTLY superior to hasty stroke in my opinion. 

First off Hasty Stroke is in spirit and many combat decks do not run spirit so you may need to rely on another deck to play this card for you when it is needed. Secondly saving a spare resource can be tricky.... especially if you have both Test of Will AND hasty stroke in hand..... do you cancel that awful treachery and hope you don't see a game ending shadow card? Or do you just take the treachery and save hasty stroke just in case (and then face the potential of not having to use it at all...)?
With Sterner than Steel you don't need to save a resource as it costs zero you JUST need the tactics resource match on a hero.

The very nature of shadow cards is that they are a nasty surprise as well as highly unpredictable so having a cancel that does not require resources is honestly the most ideal situation in my opinion as this means no matter what the game state so long as there is a weapon or armour attachment on the defending character you can ALWAYS cancel a shadow with this card. The amount of times I have had Hasty Stroke in hand but cannot play it at a pivotal moment is beyond count. I can tell you that in the VAST VAST majority of these situations my defender had Gondorian Shield or Elven Mail or in many situations BOTH attached to him. 

Thirdly and lastly exhausting a card like Gondorian Shield, Elven Mail or any of the other various weapons or armour that do not require exhausting for their effects is not only completely inconsequential but it is also going to happen very reliably considering that character is a dedicated defender and is SUPPOSED to receive those attachments anyway and as quickly as possible. Armour and Weapons that require exhausting for their own effects obviously are nowhere near as good paired with Sterner than Steel but I run very few of these type of cards so for me and many others this will not be a concern. 
This card is going straight into my decks and hasty stroke is coming straight out of them. 

The other three are great as well. One spirit resource for +2 defence AND readying that character, yes please! The Golden Shield is not quite as great as it is unique, restricted and requires exhausting however it does not say printed willpower so someone like spirit Theoden with 2 mounts attached and Elfhelm hero in play would get a +4 defence boost from the shield which is actually pretty **** powerful. Eowyn similarly can get +4 WITHOUT any boosts as her starting willpower is 4. Tactics Theoden would get +3 and is also a great recipient. I definitely think the weakest is Livery of the Tower but honestly even it seems like it would shine in certain decks. It can replace healing altogether in certain situations (Livery + Raven Winged Helm could completely negate any need for healing in a spirit/tactics deck) and does cost zero so I can see it being extremely good in certain situations. The restricted slot it takes up is somewhat worrying however as it does not add any stats or other abilities and if you have no resources to prevent damage with in the first place it does absolutely nothing at all. 

SO MANY new options and cards for defensive play and attachment heavy decks. The cards we get in Saga packs sometimes are just so goddamn useful/powerful/epic.

Take undefended, use Livery to make sure he doesn't die. Then, defend a real attack normally, use that money you made from the first attack to absorb damage from the second. It isn't amazing, but it's pretty solid.

 

 

 

Blood of Numenor is good when your shields don't get hit. BoN can give shields for multiples attacks where Livery can only absorb 1 damage at a time. Livery also counts as armor.....  The two are a balancing act. Probably depends on the quest sometimes.

Why 6?

Wow, such an incredible treat. So many possibilities.

 

Théoden with Snowmane and Golden Shield suddenly becomes a super quester-defender (you just have to make sure to quest successfully lest your defending plans fall to sudden ruin).

 

Sterner than Steel is amazing for Tactics. The shadow effects becoming ever more bothersome, this is what the sphere needed, I feel.

 

A ton of new options for Spirit to shine in defense. I really like the Éowyn/Beregond swap, both being obviously amazing in their new roles.

 

I wish this art for Prince Imrahil was on his Tactics hero version which is a great card. This too is a great card, though I do not immediately know into which deck to put it (not having built a Caldara deck recently).

Also, with The Sun's Rising, Heir of Mardil, and Herugrim he can attack for a ton (or with just Armored Destrier, attack for 3). I suspect a possible Théoden jank deck becoming real, maybe with Galadriel and Elfhelm. Galadriel with the Mirror fetches attachments while Elfhelm supports and buffs Théoden, who does pretty much everything. Obviously not as powerful as Blood/Fire but still pretty fun and thematic.

Or Spirit. You need Snowmane for the double action, and if Elfhelm is there, the Spirit Théoden becomes 3-willpower hero too. Quest for 3, defend 1 attack anywhere with 5 is a good deal to me, for the two cards of the total cost of 2. On the other hand, I am no expert on Rohan decks, they tend to be weak.

Tactics ally: Almost certainly Éomer.

Leadership ally: Almost certainly Halbarad.

Spirit has always been the poster child IMO. But Tactics is getting some nice toys largely in part of Tactics Eowyn. And on episode 100 of CotR podcast, Matt Newman did mention he had a mono solo tactics deck that is quite viable using Theodred, Eowyn and an unannounced tactics hero. It's starting to feel that tactics is no longer the red-headed stepchild. It can finally pull it's own weight for once.

By Théodred, you mean Théoden, right? But we could see a new version of Théodred at some point soon, I hope. I know it is not the most famous of characters but since his Leadership hero version has been out since the core, we could get another version, at least an ally.

I can think of two reasons:

 

1) Blood of Numenor you have to pay up front.  Livery you can pay after you take damage.

2) Boosting your defense only prevents damage from attack.  This can prevent direct damage from encounter cards and shadow cards.

I don't think Tactics can complain about Spirit from this pack.  Tactics Eowyn and Sterner Than Steel makes Spirit a lot more expendable...

A mono-Spirit deck (eg any Caldara deck) can use Emery as well.

 

I'll also note that, even if Imrahil can't give Caldara an extra Ally, you can still effectively play him for 1 resource (via Sneak Attack, since it's been ruled that he completely dodges the return-to-hand clause if he's no longer an Ally at the end of the phase), so he's still got some decent synergy.

If you don't mind having a hero that can't attack or defend and has the worst possible stat line in the game.

You can always trigger Blood after seeing the shadow card but before resolving the damage, right? If so, then the only major difference is to cancel direct damage, but it seems like a really expensive way to do so. If it's archery damage, I'd probably do better to use those resources to put down an ally with hit points instead. If it's a shadow effect, Hasty Stroke is probably more versatile.

I guess Livery is better in the case that you want to prevent one damage and you only have one resource, which probably isn't terribly uncommon. I'm not sure I would put it in my deck though.

Yeah, but only if you have the resources already on him. Going from the Wingfoot + Quick Ears ruling where responses that cancel have to occur before any others, Glóin wouldn't get resources from the damage before you'd have to cancel it with Livery.

Sure spirit has some 3 attack power heroes, but without the tactics weapons they are still not fully competent in fights.

There's an action window between "resolve shadow effect" and "determine combat damage", so in the case of a boosted attack, using Blood could be more efficient or less efficient, depending on how many resources you have available and how much you want to stop.  Obviously Blood is worthless with one resource, and Livery is better with two resources -- it can stop two damage, while Blood cannot.  With three or more resources Blood has the potential to be cheaper, though with any number of resources, Livery is capable of stopping N damage while Blood is maxed out at N-1.

 

However, there are other shadows that Livery protects against and Blood does not.  Cards that reduce or eliminate defense may not be salvageable with Blood, and cards that do direct damage are not affected by Blood, but can be prevented with Livery.  On a high-defense defender, those are precisely the sort of shadows I worry about.

 

Livery can also reduce damage from undefended attacks.  As a use-every-turn measure, Blood's (potentially) lower cost and ability to buff defense for the entire phase is definitely superior.  As an emergency save-my-hero protection, Livery is more flexible and powerful.  However, it does have the disadvantage of taking a restricted slot, which Blood does not.

Good thoughts about the Livery. The nice bonus of it now is that it is armour. Restricted can be a problem, so of course you have to pick your targets wisely. Right now, Gondorian Shield and Livery of the Tower seem two best restricted attachments for Tactics Boromir. I always see him rather as a defender than a attacker -- though he often does a lot of attacking too. Blood and Fire are hard to apply without Leadership, but Livery is good even without a couple of resources.

Since the art for this version of Fellowship Aragorn shows him mounted, and we got Shadowfax and Arod in the Treason of Saruman, I think there's a good chance that we'll get a Roheryn mount attachment in this box. The Grey Company brought Roheryn with them, knowing that Aragorn needed haste. There's a good chance that Roheryn's neutral, to fit with any version of Aragorn, but Leadership would also work.

Since Aragorn's ability relates to artifacts, I expect that we'll get an artifact attachment. If Roheryn's in the box, the artifact would very likely be Fellowship sphere. The standard Arwen made for Aragorn seems the likeliest option.
