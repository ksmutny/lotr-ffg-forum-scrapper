Been playing with a multiplayer deck I call Ziggy it is based on the "Nightmare Cycle" deck.. and it seams to compleatly break the game.. give it a shot and tell me what you think...

Ziggy's Mining Dust (Ziggy for Short) (Kaz)

3 Stand and Fight (x)
3 Gandalf's Search (x)
3 Brok Ironfist (6)
3 Beorn (6)
3 Grim Resolve (5)
3 Landroval (5)
3 Fortune or Fate (5)
3 We Do Not Sleep (5)
3 Beorn's Hospitality (5)
3 Gildor Inglorion (5)
3 Gandalf (5)
3 Radagast (5)
3 The Galadhrim's Greeting (3)
3 Zigil Miner (2)
3 Sneak Attack (3)
3 Dwarven Tomb (3)
2 Will of the West (1)
3 Parting Gifts (0)
1 Rumour from the Earth (0)

Heroes:
1 Eleanor
1 Dwalin
1 Bifur

Yeah... it dose what you are thinking.... The key cards are "Parting Gifts" / "Zigil Miner" / "Will of the West" / "Dwarven Tomb" / "Stand and Fight". The idea is for your draw engine to pull Ziggy into your had as fast as possible, if you get it in set up 6, then your laughing. The vast majority of cards in the deck are (5) cost, I put the costs in brackets after the card names in the list. You simple use Ziggy's ability and call 5 every time. You normally hit that. Soon you are rolling in resources, resources that you pile on a single hero. Then the goal is to use "Parting Gifts" to send mass resources to your mates side of the room, or simply pay for your out laddish cards. Use "Dwarven Tomb" to exhume will of the west so you always have one in hand. If you discard both of them, do not worry, you have 3 Tomb's to get one back. You can increase your odds by putting in 3. Your going to be discarding a lot of cards, so " Stand and Fight" will allow you to play from your yard.

And that is pretty much it.. very simple.. but SOOOOOooOOOOOooo broken. I transferred 38 resources to my mates in our first test game, and I also have all the big 5 cost boys on my table. I had a turn 1 game were my partner used 10 resources and emptied his hand onto the table. It is crazy. Think about a draw deck.. but being able to PLAY every card not just discard to fule protector.

There are some things the other deck needs to do, and one is to run songs. You need to place a tactic and leadership song on one of Ziggy's heroes. It also really helped for the 2nd player to run a draw engine to allow Ziggy to dig for its namesake card. Lastly, We ran the Dwarf God on the 2nd players team also played Protector on one of Ziggys Heroes so he could empty his had at every opportunity and cycle it back in with "Will of the West". If you get a "Will of the West" and 2 "Dwarven Tomb" in your hand.. your laughing.

Give it a go.. it is pretty fun, though kinda broken. Remember the key with this deck is to play form your YARD not your hand, as you want to be sending many of your resources to your partners deck, whom is running most of the "real" cards.

The deck needs some work, there is a balance between 4 and 5 cost cards that can be reached to make this deck more effective as most 5's are unique, still cards that used to seam useless like Beekeeper.. suddenly become awesome. Cast, +dmg to all / "Stand and Fight" + Beekeeper / Discard 1 dmg to all ... repeat

how will this work solo....im guessing its still a pretty tight strategy? or am i missing something that makes solo different, also whats this dwarf god you keep refering to?

Well, it would take a lot of tooling. Though I think I could do it.. I'll do some tests for you if you like. The deck would be watered down as the inclusion of much needed cards would reduce the resource gain. Like adding songs, or other types of lower cost cards. Still it could be a extremely fast deck. Remember with enough resource gain and "Stand and Fight" you can splash allies with out songs.

I guess you would need it's own card draw as well as some kind of hero protection, so Frodo, Beravor/Bilbo and Elenore (I just can not live with out her control of treachery cards)

cool...let me know what you come up with...i noticed it needed multiple core sets so i wont be able to try it

in that case i think the deck obviously relies on alot of core sets- well 3 for a soloer to get 3 copies of each unique/rare

also ill be interested to see what everyone makes of this and if it is so powerful then what restriction FFG will come up with, if any

I have been seeing a few of these Zigil Miner decks that's claim to break the game popping up. I am having a hard time believing that these decks can give you resources fast enough to play enough cards to stabalize yourself if you have a tough beginning enounter deck draw (which happens in a good amount of games I have played). If you don't get the perfect combination, you basically can't do anything which doesn't seem all that great to me.

It definitely sounds like a fun idea to try though! I don't have enough core sets to make something like that but would love to hear about the success rate of this.

It is defiantly a "joke" deck.. but you are drawing on average 7 resources a round... so it is pretty crazy.It is just for fun.

I like the idea and am going to try it solo. I'd go with Eowyn, Frodo and Eleanor.

With Eowyn, you are able to discard and effectively make use of Stand and Fight (too bad it doesn't work on Gandalf).

Not sure about the 6-cost guys however. Since you want to call 5 with the Miner anyway, you could swap them for 3 Northern Tracker and maybe 3 Ancient Mathoms. Parting Gift can also be removed for Song of Kings as you will want to be able to sneak Gandalf in. I'd also remove Gandalf's Search and add Unexpected Courage instead. Rumours from the Earth becomes your 3rd Will of the West.

Obviously, playing a Dwarf character would allow you to use the new Belt for full-multicolor production, but you'd still need Song of Kings to play the Belt in the first place, so not 100 % sure...

The main challenge will be fighting. Too many early enemies will put pressure on you, but you can try to delay with Frodo not taking damage and ganging enemies.

 @booored:  dude, other than one minor glitch we caught a round later and sort of self-corrected, I just modified your deck and one of my hobbits and I beat the 7th level!  (I'd won solo, but we haven't won as a duo or trio yet.). Brought back two dead Heros, played all types of 4-5 cost allies.  The great round was when I got an extra 11 tokens and then reshuffled my deck with only three cards left.  I had gildor available to exhaust and was able to put brok in place of will of the west which I needed badly, and then "guessed" 6 for the first miner on the next round followed by a five for my second miner!  Thanks my friend!

 Ps, I used Eleanor, beravor, and Dain.

Yea it is pretty crazy.. .you get out 2 ziggys and you can pull 12 resources a turn above the 3 you normally get.

 I think I had like 57 cards, which is a pretty big deck for me, I like to stay at 50.  Didn't get the guesses rights every turn as I don't have three core sets, just two, so there wasn't a.ways a five to guess.  But still did pretty good.  Two miners def. ups the possibilities.

As is say before nightmare is a joke. Is suppose to be for hard core players but all the time you can get some crazy combo which broken the game.

As i always say :  Will of the west, Beravur, Tracker should be ban from tournaments play.

Well the nightmare rules have changed according to the latest FAQ, so I suppose Nightmare is a bit harder now.

But I agree that Will of the West is broken, especially in combination with Beravor + Unexpected Courage. With this combo you can often sneak Gandalf more than 10 times in a scenario. And I think UC should be restricted or even unique.

Oh, I like giving nick names to things, more more often I like to propagate other peoples nick names I like. Dwarf God was a description of Dain Iron Foot... I'm going to stick with that when ever I speak of him.. another one was HillariousPete's using "Rabbit Run Deck" to describe the super fast Rohan RTM deck. So I now call that deck "Rabbit Run" and use the term Rabbit Deck to describe a heavy rohan quest deck. It amuses me and, imo, as the game gets larger having real community inspired names for decks and tactics is a good thing.

no you go for it, its actually quite amusing....though a little hard to keep up with

oh yeah, and another point, people can call what they like as long as i dont see the words 'toon' or any other variation of mmo lingo......its confuses the hell out of me! though i do like calling gimli a tank, so im as guilty as anyone else.......

ps, i may be wrong but im sure i was the first one to post the rabbit run deck, though i didnt call it that.....not wanting credit or anything...lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif]

Oh I use the term TOON all the time.. I really suck at spelling.. as in I am nearly illiterate. Often I use the term toon simply as I can not spell character with out a spell check and I can not spell any of the character names.

I meant HilariousPete coined the phrase Rabbit Run.

Hey guys...

I've uploaded my session to youtube of me playing with my solo version of  Ziggy. Here is the deck List. [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/index.php?/topic/1671-lotr-deck-ziggy-miner-dust-solo-version/page__pid__4006#entry4006]. I got a score of 90, was really fun and worth a try.

also back on topic ive been playing with zigil and map maker- pretty much what youve done here........land all the resources onto bifur and put the extra one per turn onto him, then buff up map makers willpower by about 10/15 per turn.....crazy stuff....thought id mention it as i didnt see him in any of your decks

LoL… drives Ziggy.. at a cost of 2 instead of 5.. and can support all 3 Ziggys being in play at the same time (instead of only 2) AND can support any spirit player at teh table (so in 2 player game you can run 6 ziggys off this one card) AND it is in teh correct sphere so no need to go deep into lore to drive ziggy

On paper, it certainly makes Zigil Miner-based strategies even more effective than they already are. The one downside I see is the inability to swap a card from your hand with one from the top of the deck. I don't think it'll matter very often, but there might be situations in which none of the top five cards in your deck are worth sacrificing. Also, the Stargazer is quite a bit more fragile than Gildor. 

Definitely an upgrade under most circumstances, though.

ohh … yeah your right.. this might be key to getting the deck to function. Still a proper deck set will should always hit high costs cards in 5 so it might not make a difference… I'll run a test deck using a proxy.

Imladris Stargazer + Ziggy = broken game

I'm sure there's some sort of reason why FFG is enabling more Ziggy decks, but I can't even remotely think of it. Ziggy is the worst thing they've done for this game and now they are pouring fuel on the fire. What are they thinking? If they ever set up tournament play, I expect Zigil Miner to be one of the first cards that gets banned.

This isn't power creep, it's power surge. I fear for the long term stability of the game if this is the kind of comboing they are encouraging.

But are decks that exploit Ziggy actually getting the best results, in terms of (a) low scores, (b) winning consistently, © the combination of these two that is reflected in the scoring for juicebox's tournaments?

I'm not convinced that they are, going by the results reported for the aforementioned juicebox tournaments (the best data we have available).

yes i believe they do get consistent results….just ask boored….early on in its release he was one of the first players to really exploit it…there was a long discussion over its brokeness or otherwise….and i agree its broken - worst cards of the game….personally i have solved this by jsut not playing it

the argument of is it or isn't it broken has been done to death.. play with it or not.. lets not rehash all that… .. but…

it should be noted that the ziggy deck is at its heart a support deck. While there was a deck from Tragic when ziggy was released that was designed for solo it is not a particularly great solo deck.. I mean you will hardly EVER loose.. but your scores will not be that good.. in a normal game though this is not true. in it full form as a support deck in multiplayer it is pretty insane.

the arguement has indeed been done to death and more, but it still remains that the points for a counter argument are getting less and less….with each of the cards that help the zigil deck it gets stronger and stronger, stargazer just completely boosts its usefulness tenfold

as ive said i dont use it, however i still agree with style75-its fuel to the zigil fire
