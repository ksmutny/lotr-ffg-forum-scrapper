Can I use Master Ironsmith [https://ringsdb.com/card/12033]to cheat into play attachments for which I have no resource match amongst my heroes?

Yes, no problem.

I was uncertain since it specifies " without paying its resource cost" but there is no mention one way or the other of the "resource match" and so by going back to the default rules it should still be fulfilled. The wording of Reforged it's different for example, since it clearly says "any sphere".

If it said "play," you MIGHT be in trouble but since it just says "attach," you're good.Â  You only have to have a resource match when you "play" a card.

Even if it did say play, you might still be OK, since you're actually not paying the cost anyway. If it did say "play for 0 cost," then you WOULD need a match.
