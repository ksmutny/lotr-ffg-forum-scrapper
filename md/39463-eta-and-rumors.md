What's going on with this game? Anyone know? It was at Gencon with a playable demo and they were doing some fair press releases on the site. Now we are only getting 1 press release a month. I was hoping this game would be available before the holiday season.

 

Anyone have any idea? I really need my card game fix since I've stopped buying in to Warhammer...

Current rumors have it looking like a February release time frame.

The Italian Publisher Giochi Uniti said febraury/march 2011

I Think that it will the release date world wide

"English rules are ready and at German translator"

"FFG has first right, we will publish german rules online after FFG has published english ones"

Does anybody know if FFG is on a break this week from updates?

## 6 [Toqtamish on December 28, 2010](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/39463-eta-and-rumors/?do=findComment&comment=400378)

Traditionally yes, however I am seeing new articles up today for some of the games.

I've also stopped getting W:I battle packs.

I was for a while getting GoT and W:I but after the corruption cycle ended I dropped W:I, game was too out of balance and lost its fun for me. New preview for LotR just went up. "Keepers of the Lore"

Maybe it's taking longer to develop the first cycle of adventure packs than expected?  Can't just release a core set without an expansion cycle queued up and ready to go.

That would be nice.  I played the demo at GenCon 2010 and I have been looking forward to this in a big way ever since.

 So, what do you think guys (and gals, I assume)? Are we going to get some new info tomorrow, are they going to start stepping up the previews or are they going to continue the every other week thing?

According to the german publisher Heidelberger release date for the english and german version is April 2011.

That is closes to the truth. The game will be published in Spring 2011. The official release date is unknown to this day.

I was expecting a much later release date than early speculation gave us.  April sounds right, unfortunately...

Oh well...it's hard to wait, but better than rushing it out with problems, etc.

I still expect loop holes so great Sauron might disappear in.

As the following wednesday passed without any info about this game, does anyone know when can we expect the next scrap of information?

## 19 [radioboyeric on February 3, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/39463-eta-and-rumors/?do=findComment&comment=418781)

It looks like we are back on the monthly update. <sigh>

## 20 [qwertyuiop on February 4, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/39463-eta-and-rumors/?do=findComment&comment=419454)

So I just noticed that in the online store Thought Hammer, within the past few days this game has gone from "Publisher's Estimated Release Date: Q1 2011" to "Publisher's Estimated Release Date: April 2011."  Hmm.  Here's the relevant link:

Yeah I'm seeing more and more sites saying April... Dang. But at least the release timing is becoming a little more clear.

## 24 [Spirit Juggler on February 10, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/39463-eta-and-rumors/?do=findComment&comment=422197)

I've figured April pretty much since it was announced, going on past ffg experience. FFG upcoming though still has it as in development as opposed to having made it to the printers yet.  

## 25 [Frog on February 10, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/39463-eta-and-rumors/?do=findComment&comment=422209)

It still says in development, not even at the printers or on the boat(2 months away).

So realistically summer seems to be the earliest for this game.

They announced this waaaaay to far in advance!

## 26 [Sky on February 11, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/39463-eta-and-rumors/?do=findComment&comment=422475)

Though I think your points seem valid, I am not so sure about conclusion. European distributors are quite advanced in the process of translating the game to local languages. I doubt any reasonable publisher would agree to sign an agreement regarding unfinished product. So I keep my fingers crossed on the april release date.

What concerns me though is total lack of new info about the game :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]. And I crave information about:

1. Other spheres - all other LCG were initially released with 4 factions with 2 additional to come later. What are they and how will they integrate into game?

2. Chapterpacks - new adventurers will be released... but devil hides in details. What will be card distribution? How will they blend with starter and other adventures? There is no need for 3 copies of each quest card or quest item, or hero... how will that be solved?

3. Licence - when does it expire - other CCG regarding LotR ceased after the licence expired.

I wonder why FFG haven't bought the licence from WB to make this game official and using the design of LoTR movies?

Why?  So they can put out a piece of garbage with movie stills or horrible art aping the movies?

Thankfully, that is not in their license!

Same goes for Cubicle-7's license for The One Ring RPG.  It uses all original art, only material from the Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings, and their appendixes.

Other than wisdom, a reason they probably opted not to go that route is the licensing fees are probably even higher.  Likely having to pay royalties to both Tolkien Enterprises & Peter Jackson.

I am glad they didn't do that. Decipher already did a movie version ccg. I'd rather have really good art work. Plus the movies don't cover every place and person in the books so you are limited to what cards you can put out.

UPDATE: It is now posted as at the printers on the 'upcoming' page.

## 31 [Narsil0420 on February 11, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/39463-eta-and-rumors/?do=findComment&comment=422827)

Ah you beat me to it! Woo hoo! finally! it's still listed as winter 10 though... i gues they forgot to update that!

Like good ol' Pukel Land! 

I had a good time playing the Decipher version. It was a decent enough game. The movie stills sometimes made for some hilarious gamer nerd riffing sequences. I look back on it fondly....  But I'm so ready for the new hotness.

I doubt this info will be released until it expires, or just before it expires. However FFG should have plans to have produced a reasonably "complete" game within the initial licence period + plans to expand further if they can (& want to) renew for a further period. 

Hopefuly it will run for many years.

I just read the following info from this site today.

It looks like Games Workshop has bought the rights from WB for six more years.

Wiz Kids also just signed a deal with WB to make miniatures and boardgames with the movie licenses...

Sorry, I'm super excited to have this game in hand. And I only just read about it for the first time the day before yesterday. I can't imagine what you folks who have been waiting for seven months are going through. 

Maybe we can hitch up some sharks to pull the boat along?

Yeah, it's been torture... kind of like a long hard slog to Mt. Doom.
