# [journey down the anduin - 1 sphere starter deck ](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61652-journey-down-the-anduin-1-sphere-starter-deck/)

I've just finished my first game (Passage through Mirkwood) using the leadership sphere.  I won, but that was due more to dumb luck than any strategy.  I'm trying to figure out what to do  next.  (all my questions refer to solitaire game play)

I am a total novice at CCG or LCG.  Reading the general forum and strategy sections, and comparing with what I did in my first game, I've come to several conclusions.

First LCG (and I assume CCG) could be used as college entry reading aptitude tests.  Speed read the cards and you may as well make up your own rules.  This will be very good practice for my reading comprehension.

Second, when I've read about 'Journey Down the Anduin', I question if it is useful to even try continuing with the 1 sphere 'leadership' starter deck?  It seems that a custom 2 sphere deck is the general recommendation.  Does  anyone consider JDA winnable with a 1 sphere starter deck?  If not is it a good learning experience, just an exercise in frustration, or something every new player should do?

I realize that each game doesn't take too long to play, but are there any recommendations on the best sequence of play -- play each scenario starting with #1 with each of the starter spheres before moving to #2?  Play #1 multiple times with the same sphere before moving to a different sphere?  Any other suggestions?

I have purchased a few of the expansions, more from a concern that they may be out of stock when I'm ready for them.  Of course that leads to my next question.  What are your feelings about using restricted decks or building decks using all the cards?

One more question for the future:  The rules state that custom player decks must have a minimum of 50 cards.  What a good number of card in a deck and why?  As I said, this is all new to me.

hi tom and welcome

to answer the last first, i think 50 card is the best- though players generaly play from 50-60. alot more than 50 and you will have trouble drawing the cards you want- there are times when a bigger deck is needed- im thinking about card draw decks, but 50 s a good number

yes you need to read the cards carefully, and not being rude (everyone has had this problem) but you will still then make mistakes....just try to grab 'em before you get bad habits

i would recommend deck building as soon as you can. this game gets pretty tough, especially when not building deck- the core set pre made decks are just for practice- to test the water as it were, so you dont stand a chance to be honest, and it will just frustrate you

your playing times/methods are your own- do as you will enjoy! i only play this game so can dedicate all my times to it- and i do, so i can play which ever scenario i wish with whatever decks i wish, as i have the time and space to set them up

i do not use restricted decks- i am a theme player- i play for my passion for LOTR and middle earth, so im not too bothered as long as i have a decent win rate and i enjoy it- alot of other players play with only the cards that were available at the time of the quests release ie. if you are playing journey to rhosgobel (no.3) then you will only build decks with cards from core/huntfor gollum/carrock/rhosgobel- this is useful if you eventually find the games earlier quests too easy to play with the more powerful later cards
