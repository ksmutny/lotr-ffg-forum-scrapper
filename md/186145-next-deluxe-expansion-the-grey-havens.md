Really excited about this expansion. I know almost nothing about the Grey Havens and it will be a blast to discovers a totally new region of the middle-earth. I not quite sure about the nautical theme and all the ships (cause it such a departure from the rest of the game), but it will probably turn out great and I hope it will bring some fresh air to the game. And we will finally get Cirdan, with an awesome 4 willpower and an interesting ability. Cannot wait to see what they will do with that cycle.

BEST THEME YET.

 

I was kind of expecting this to be the point where the theme went slightly downhill for my taste, because I love the Dunedain and didn't think anything could really top them, but Cirdan is one of my favourite characters and I'm right there with Matt Newman on the fascination of the Grey Havens. Oh, and then I read the part where we're going to the ruins of Numenor. On top of which it's all new and different stuff. So this is probably the high thematic point for me, because I really can't think of where they'd go next that would excite me this much, but obviously I've been proven wrong before...

Don't worry, we are not even through half the current cycle, it will be ages until this box ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

 

Cirdan. 4 starting willpower, decent side stats. Draws you 1 additional card during and dumps 1 each turn. Natural fit for Caldara.

Who was complaining about a lack of high willpower spirit heroes the other day? :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

 

Cirdan is amazing. Providing spirit with card draw without even requiring an exhaust? With the rest of the current cycle supposedly supporting the Noldor discard mechanic, by the time Cirdan is released the discard requirement might actually be a positive, if it isn't already. And with his access to Elrond's counsel I don't even see his high threat cost as a downside.

 

Superb theme too. I applaud the designers!

I was really impressed by the GENCON quest.  I'm so happy to see that the creativity continues to flow in spades.  Very excited for this.  Also, somewhat terrified.  If a GM ever asks you "Do you get on the boat?" the answer should universally be "RUN AWAY!"

I hope so... it's announced for the end of this year, though. I'm thinking about stopping after the actual cycle and the saga boxes. I want to get Voice of Isengard and 2 AP (Celebrimor and the one with all the Ents), 'cause it's getting too expensive on the long run, and I also want to buy other games...

Breaks my heart, I LOVE this game... and after having 2 000+ cards, it gets a little overwhelming!...

I love everything about this. Apart from Belegaer and enchanted islands, my hope for the player cards is that we get more focus on the artifact trait and we get our darn palantiri and magic rings. Other than that, I absolutely love the idea of a seafaring cycle and the art really does it justice.

> Hey, lore guys. How do you think, do we have a chance to see Umbar in this cycle?

Well, as I understand it the deluxe expansions and cycle packs are supposed to take place between The Hobbit and the trilogy. So hypothetically if the year is around TA 2980 we could get Thorongil (Aragorn) as an objective-ally or something and witness the sack of Umbar.

A sailing theme is so perfect, and I love how they are making the ships objectives, almost like saga boons, so they don't mess up the card pool as a whole. This is the sort of on theme exploration that can bring in a wider audience, especially of Tolkien fans.

The long awaited Cirdan looks amazing. He has a kind of mini Erestor effect, card sifting more than card draw, but still fantastic given the role of uniques in the game (as well as Caldera synergy).

I am super pumped.

> Hey, lore guys. How do you think, do we have a chance to see Umbar in this cycle?

My hunch is no. I think they'll save that for its own cycle. Unless the last pack is the lead in to Umbar.

Actually the deluxes and cycles are set in the 17 years between Bilbo leaving the Shire on his 111th birthday, and Frodo leaving the Shire with the Ring.

 

In any case, Umbar is highly unlikely for this cycle, since Umbar is south from Gondor, while we're way northwest of Gondor at the Grey Havens. It'd be a bit of a long voyage.

Umbar is something we may see since there are corsairs ...

I am nearly certain we will get Cirdans ring, Narya, which will be able to attach either Cirdan or Gandalf. Also I guess we will get a Galdor Hero.

Since we are travelling to Numenor (paradise cannot be better than that, I almost cry) we might get something for Palantiri, to even better something like an artifact from Earendil or Elros ...

Right, I wasn't sure. Haven't played past the first quest in Heirs of Númenor and the scenarios before that reveal little that could help us tell the time.

 

Just realised, with just one copy of Fair and Perilous, Cirdan attacks for 6. With two copies, he attacks for 10. (It doesn't seem to have a limit?)

Cirdan with Galadriel, light of Valinor and fair and perilous can quest for eight and attack for six each round ...

And with Map of Eärnil, it's easily reusable. The map is even a thematic fit.

Looking forward to Erestor + Cirdan decks. Start of your turn, draw 5, discard 1. And awesome with those Lindon Navigators, since you're essentially discarding card for two willpower (which is better than you get with Eowyn or Protector of Lorien).

 

Also Silver Wing looks awesome in a secrecy style deck. +1 attack on everyone and 3 lower starting threat is a ton of leeway.

I love how super-positive everyone is for this next step - it's so awesome! Cannot wait to get my hands on this one, even though I'm still loving the whole Angmar thing. I must've had the most stupidest grin on my face ever when reading we'll be getting a ship for our party at the beginning of each scenario. I mean, ships! There's just too much good stuff for this game right now - it's an amazing time to be a card-gamer!

Galdor is a candidate, if not for the box then for an AP. Do not remember other characters from Grey Havens

If we get Narya as i believe, a super thematic deck would be Elrond with Vilya, Galadriel with Nenya and Cirdan with Narya. Three Great Elves from the first age ...

PS: just noticed he is a Noldor ... Silvan would fit better since he never took the journey.

He should be Sindar, but then again so should Legolas and Celeborn. I realise they can only have so many traits floating around. (heh, floating...) 

 

Can I just very *humbly* say I called the idea of ships in a thread about 6 months ago:

 

> Name: Cirdan's Beard
> 
> Type: Attachment - Unique.
> 
> Sphere: Neutral 
> 
> Cost: 0
> 
> Artifact. Beard.
> 
>  
> 
> Time 3. Play Cirdan's Beard into the staging area unattached.
> 
>  
> 
> Forced: After the last time counter is removed from Cirdan's Beard, attach it to Cirdan. While it is attached, lower the cost to play Boat cards by 1.

 

edit: But I fear a unique Beard attachment may not make it past the brainstorming stage.

Also there's Nor am I a Stranger+Herugrim. Not thematic, but a very reliable 6 attack.

 

I guess the same combo has already existed for Glorfindel though.

Most of the Noldor in the game never took the journey, because they were born after the Noldor came back. The only ones we have who've actually been to Valinor are Glorfindel and Galadriel.

That aside, although Cirdan is of the Teleri, since they simplified the Elves down to just Noldor and Silvan, it feels to me like Cirdan fits in better with the more noble Noldor rather than the forest-dwelling Silvans.

Considering the trait and theme, it would be great if we had at least some minor resource acceleration so Harbor Master can have some new life blown into him. Or he was a dud and should've been part of the discard mechanic. Time will tell. Matt and Caleb keep coming up with such awesome ideas, so I have every faith in this. So much to look forward to now!

Speaking of which, that beard is devastatingly majestic. It needs its own attachment.

Amazing boat mechanics and cards that don't mess with the actual card pool.

Sailing type quests with off-course hazards.

Pirates, Elves and Valinor.

The Majestic beard of a powerful hero.

10/10 expansion, would sail again.

Saw the article link on the FFG page, immediately put on the LotR movie Grey Havens track, and went on to die happily. I'm so excited for this, and it's so fun being a part of a community of people who love ME lore and LotR LCG, and are so positive about this game and its future.

Is it time for completely unfounded Narya speculation yet? If you go the "goes with both Cirdan and Gandalf" route, how many possibilities could there be? Switch any card in discard pile with top card of deck or something? Scratch that, that would be way OP. But what else?

Wow... this is pretty epic. The art is incredible and I cannot believe we get to go to the ruins of numenor..... EPIC!!!!!!!!! 

I'm not that big on the ships and naval combat though  -_- [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sleep.png] but I am sure it will be amazing. Looks like it will be done really well with enemy ships ramming your ship (only ships can defend other ships attacks apparently) and their crew boarding your ship which is very cool. If we were just fighting enemy ships it would be very silly but the fact they all have a crew that are formed by a "corsair deck" is so **** cool. Attacking the enemy ship after its crew are dispatched makes sense too as you are setting it ablaze/sinking it after dealing with its crew. 

 

Finally we will get Cirdan! He goes super well with Erestor. Also first hero with four willpower no?

He's the third 4 WP hero after Eowyn and Galadriel. I'm glad that he's got a few more points of stats and threat than those two, though -- I'm looking forward to letting Cirdan hold onto the Light of Valinor rather than Glorfindel for a change.

 

EDIT: I'm excited to see how they handle the ruins of Numenor. Maybe we'll find relics of when Sauron was visiting them. I'm excited for any additional 1st/2nd Age lore they can pull in. Also, having a nautically themed cycle is a nice change of pace from an art direction. Though there is high quality art throughout the game, I'm happy to see things get shaken up. The mechanics seem promising, as well. Looking forward to future previews and its release in the "4th quarter" of the year (aka sometime around February :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] ).

Ah yes Eowyn does too. Why did I not think of her. I don't really count Galadriel as without Nenya the 4 willpower cannot be used for questing anyway. Cirdan is a fantastic target for light of valinor. Fair and Perilous (as others have already mentioned) is also beastly with him giving him +4 attack (more than any other Noldor or Silvan except Galadriel who cannot attack so whatevs..)

I think its a spoiler for Across the Ettenmoors. They interviewed Matt Newman (pretty sure it was Matt?) on a recent podcast and he brought 3 cards along and gave them a choice of just one to spoil (based on a very vague description of each) and they chose this one. I think one of the others interacts with the victory display (was probably none return as we did not yet have this spoiled I believe) and I can't remember what the other was. A leadership card that does something I think?

That statline on Cirdan (plus his being Noldor) really makes me want to feed him to the Balrog so I can resurrect him at 5, 3, 3, 4. Light of Valinor, Anduril, Fair and Perilous, man that could be fun.

I was always undrer the impression that Numenor was swallowed by the sea along with Ar-Pharazon's fleet when he tried to invade Arda.

"And Andor, the Land of Gift, Numenor of the Kings, Elenna of the Star of Earendil, was utterly destroyed. For it was nigh to the east of the great rift and it's foundations were overturned, and it fell and went down into the darkness and is no more."

The highest peak on the island was said to have survived the destruction of Numenor. Perhaps we investigate this and discover that a little more land than initially thought survived the destruction or perhaps we have to do some diving to discover the lost treasures there!!

So you think we'll get 2 leadership events that interact with side quests? Unlikely in my opinion.

 

Also, Glaurung's reaction made me happy. I also think this game has surpassed MECCG in many ways, and this is the best example, but there's still things MECCG covered way better in its very first set (sadly the Blue Wizards was one of them, which we'll surely never get), but namely, elven artifacts and the whole artifice corruption theme, which was essential in Tolkien (I'll never get tired of saying this.) Assuming we'll possibly get Narya in this expansion, this could be a chance to explore it. Maybe we'll get some treasure themed player cards.

From the same article:  "After the destruction of Númenor, some amongst the Exiles believed that the summit of the mountain remained as an isle in Belegaer. Some Dúnedain are even said to have set sail trying to reach the isle, from which the legend held that one could catch a glimpse of the unreachable Aman." 

 
Sounds like the next cycle could be some mystical quest set beyond the seas. Pretty awesome.

"Finally, The Grey Havens also gives you your first opportunity to take control of Círdan the Shipwright (The Grey Havens, 1) and the Elves of Mithlond, who take the Noldor themes introduced in the Angmar Awakened cycle to the next level, introducing cards that increase in power with each copy of that card in the discard pile, and cards that grow more powerful depending on the card that's on the top of your discard pile!"

 

This gives us an idea of what some of the noldor discard mechanics will be. Some cards will get stronger depending how many copies of the same card are in the discard pile (this will be interesting as at most there can only be 2 in the discard pile due to the limit of 3 of any card in a deck) which is pretty cool, sort of the opposite to some of the encounter effects in Deadmen's Dike. Then we have cards that will grow more powerful depending on what the top card of our discard pile is. This also sounds really cool and could encourage deckbuilding with few events (so that the top card of your discard stays the same for as long as possible) or allows cards like Erestor or Cirdan himself to boost this effect as when you discard your hand from Erestors effect I imagine you can choose the order, similarly Cirdan makes you discard a card (after you get to draw an additional one) so each turn you can make sure the card on top of your discard pile is one that will boost the card with this new mechanic. 

I really really like the sound of these effects.

Indeed most did not, but they are descendants of the ones who did, i should have made more clear

But you have a very strong point that he should be a Noldor, i agree on that, it was the better solution after all

In Silmarillion, there is the following : 

 

"Among the Exiles many believed that the summit of Meneltarma, the Pillar of Heaven, was not drowned for ever, but rose again above the waves, a lonely island lost in the great waters"

 

The Dunedains made trips to find it but that never happened. So this is what we will be looking for probably.

On the slopes of Meneltarma where the tombs of the Kings of Numenor, so there could be relics to be found

Just saw this now and am overjoyed. The opportunity to touch places and events prior to the 3rd Age, however fleetingly and indirectly, is very exciting to me. The new direction of the game in this cycle, with its emphasis on maritime journeys and exploration is also thrilling to hear. A great part of my reading enjoyment of Tolkien's material comes from the many wondrous places he reveals to us. Simply gazing upon the cover art of The Grey Havens box gave me just such a sense of wonder. And the way this set arrives after Angmar Awakened, with its focus on the Dunedain and Noldor, feels just right.

I had always wondered if we might see a Cirdan hero. Now we know.

Fabulous, just fabulous news.

It should be Galdor of the Havens. He was Cirdan's representative at the Council of Elrond. This would also fit in with the Noldor theme giving us two Noldor heroes. Pretty positive it will be him.

Before I thought we had too few Noldor heroes, and now there will be a whole bunch to choose from...! My only complaint about Erestor + Cirdan is that I will have to scrap Elrond as the third hero - 35 is too high if a Galadriel deck has to mind its own business.

This may be an opportunity to finish the job (because the third quest is designed and is regular).

Can we declare Bilbo officially a coaster now with Cirdan coming out?

I mean, the starting threat difference is "just" 3, and look at those stats.

Add to that the in sphere ability of spirit to interact with the discard pile on Cirdan, and there is no contest.

I think Bilbo might still have a place in some solo mono lore decks maybe, but seriously, who would pick him over Cirdan now?

I don't see Cirdan affecting Bilbo much.  They are different spheres, different traits, and Cirdan has a higher threat.  This isn't quite like a Haldir/Faramir situation because they can still fill different roles.

I start to understand this card:

 

Children-of-the-Sea.png [https://s3.amazonaws.com/hallofbeorn-resources/Images/Cards/The-Blood-of-Gondor/Children-of-the-Sea.png]

 

It is not casual that has sinergy with noldor characters, and backs to deck instead hand.

It is perhaps inevitable yet rather inconvenient for our wallets that cards with synergy are spread out as much as they are. I would love to have Children of the Sea, but I can't bring myself to pay 12 Euro when I'm not interested in the pack for any other reason. TBoG and TMV are the only two packs I don't have.

Right with you on this!! My collection is complete to-date BUT I will not deviate from playing progression style and am within Dwarrowdelf right now BUT I so so love the look of this expansion to massive levels. I will buy it instantly and then join you in drooling over it fir two years!!

The mechanics for ships and sea encounters could massively open up the game!! It loojs truly truly truly awesome!

Who knows, next we may get an airbourne expansion riding eagles against nightmares for long distance quests. Ships as mount/vehicle/ally mechanics is a fantastic idea!!

Wanna wanna play it!!

**** this game is good.

Speaking of rejuvenation...anyone else curious, concerned, or just generally thinking if we'll get more player cards that "rejuvenate" cards back in to your life deck.  Right now the only one that does it really is Will of the West and that does the entire deck and then removed from game, so its kind of the most extreme approach to it.  Just thinking with the Noldor mechanic revolving around drawing lots of cards and then discarding them, we may run out of our decks fairly quickly.  Using just Erestor and Cirdan would have you run clear through a standard 50 card deck in less than 9 turns presuming no other forms of drawing or discarding.  Maybe thats the point since there is no deck max that this will encourage not only a new mechanic but a new way to consider deck composition with 60 or 70 card decks being the norm for Noldor themed decks.  Would still be cool to see some player cards that have some subtle rejuvenation though too.  Like an ally that when it entered play, you choose 3 cards in your discard and shuffle them in.  Could help recur your best cards or also help line up an ability for having a specific card on the top of your discard like the article mentions, or an event that has you shuffle in the bottom 2 of discard and you reduce your threat by the total cost of the two cards.  Could make for some really different gameplay

Is it just a coincidence that you used those terms, or did you used to play the Dragon Ball Z card game?

 

To stay on topic, I think it would be interesting to see them continue adding recursion effects, but they will need to be creative/limited like Caldara, To Me! O' My Kinsfolk! or Ered Nimrais Prospector to avoid printing anything on the same level as (or strictly worse than) Will of the West, Dwarven Tomb, or the Record attachments.

hahaha no coincidence, looooove me some dbz.  Played Score's well beyond the point where it had died with my local friends.  Picked up Bandai's when they got the rights, mechanics of that game were dirt but played it cause it was DBZ.  Now Score's game as essentially be revived by Panini that I'm into now.  Its like a 2nd edition of the original game, exact same gameplay but cleaned up some tidbits

I agree that between Erestor and now Círdan, we are in need of more recursion effects. When testing my (albeit ridiculous) proof-of-concept Erestor Deck [https://hallofbeorn.wordpress.com/2015/05/09/deck-revenge-of-the-nerds/], I was often drawing through the deck within 4 or 5 rounds. If I were to switch Éowyn for Círdan, that deck will only get more silly. I am really interested to make a less silly version of that deck with the new victory display shenanigans. If you can draw your deck consistently in 5 rounds, it seems much more viable to plan on having the 9 removal events (plus Keen as Lances) as the engine of a strategy. In any case, I designed this card below for Ian's "invent a sphere" contest a while back. Looking at it now, it is a bit over-powered at 0 and should probably cost 1 resource, but I feel like the idea is solid. Here's hoping that we get more recursion in the next cycle.

Cool card and idea, like the art on that too. Looks almost animated, different from most ME art.

 

Seastan's solo dunedain deck utilizing Tighten Our Belts made me wonder how strong that event would be in a Noldor deck.  Could take advantage of the discarding effects to use up your hand without actually paying for anything, trigger a Tighten Our Belts for a bunch of resources the next turn and be set up for when Erestor does actually put some expensive or useful cards you want to play and not toss.  Not gonna lie when the Erestor preview was 1st revealed I was quietly skeptical of the Noldor mechanic, but even with just a few more previews the wheels are starting to turn...

I'm being aware of the peculiarity of the Noldor trait: playing with the deck-hand...

 

Erestor

Gildor

Elrond ally (and Elrond hero+Vilya)

Galadriel ally or hero

Rivendel Minstrel

Watcher of the Bruinen

Trollshaw scout

Imladris Stargazer

Master Forge

Elven Jeweller

...the next Erestor hero, Círdan!

 

All they has similar effect: scrying deck, discard cards from hand, return cards to deck or drawing cards from deck.

 

 

Children of the Sea has a similar effect also: return a noldor card in play to deck.

 

Curious trait

 

Now i'm wondering: developers and designers knew the peculiarity of noldor trait since core set? at least since when Children-of-the-sea was released? ^^

I think Elrond + Vilya is part of a different strategy than the new Noldor, though - at least from what we've seen so far. Erestor and Cirdan render the Stargazer pretty much useless since you're going to be drawing 5 cards anyway. Unless some unknown event or attachment keeps her relevant, I doubt she'll find a way into discard decks. I love Elrond but I'm not convinced Vilya fits with Erestor. Not saying every card slot in a Noldor deck has to contribute to the discard mechanic (and in a way I suppose every card does in a simple sense), but as I believe I've mentioned earlier I don't think Cirdan+Elrond+Erestor is a good hero line-up unless you've got tons of threat reduction. Then again, I'm a bit tired of depending on Spirfindel for this... we'll most likely have several new heroes to choose from once TGH and Dreamchaser starts coming out, and in new spheres.

 

addition: One thing I really like about discarding cards is that with Map of Eärnil, Tome of Atanator etc, we're going to be playing expensive events like Fortune or Fate, Grim Resolve and Dooms Hangs Still much more easily.

Another peculiarity of Noldor trait: noldor characters haven't got sinergy between them (at least not as the other traits cards). The sinergy of noldors focuses in the deck, not in other characters.

...curious (if it is true, i like it a lot)

 

This is why, Olorin93, you see Imladris is not usefull with Erestor neither Cirdan.

Actually, you're making a good point.

 

I wonder if there will be any restriction when our party "board" a ship. Historically, this game has proven the contrary, with (for example) Eagles or Ents takens into Moria, but I really would be bugged by Asfaloth exploring Ocean locations. Guess I'll have to house-rule that, but, hey, you never know.

Restrictions would be a bit difficult cause too many cards should be forbidden from boats. Ents, Dwarves, Hobbits, if we want to keep it accurate.

Well, as far as i remember they never did, most of them did not know how to swim either. Hobbits never had seen the see as Tolkien states at the beggining of LotR. So i believe that if there were races not to be able to board a ship, they should be in.

Frodo, Bilbo, Sam and Gimli made they boat trip after the War so out of our game time.

Why do you say this?  Maybe I am missing something?  With Map of Earnil etc., you still have to pay the cost of the event you're recurring. In a mono-sphere deck you're still adding 1 to the cost of that expensive event.

I have barely used those attachments myself, but I've always been under the impression that this enables you to play the discarded card for free. I don't think I've played with anyone who has played it differently. If it is not what the designers intended, it should be clarified (and mono-sphere takes a serious hit, in my opinion).

Action: Discard Book of Eldacar to play any [Tactics] event card in your discard pile as if it were in your hand. Then, place that event on the bottom of your deck.

How? It uses the same wording as Gandalf hero, yet no one ever considered cards being played by Gandalf to be free. It's just wishful thinking on player part.

Hahah my dear friend. You are even designing cards for an LotR adaptation in CoC lcg. That was the last piece of the puzzle I needed. Mnt was really busy with that when he left.

Hahah, you mean BGG, the place where MNT went after he was banned here for no good reason?

I don't know who went here, there was a thread there with this stuff in. Lets not derail the thread further.

As I mentioned earlier in the thread I am using the box art as my iPad screen now.  Simply beautiful, but…

 

The central ship is a lateen rigged ship similar to a felucca. This type of vessel is generally suitable for inland waters or harbors and not suitable for the open ocean.  This is because there is a lot of weight “up high” that can cause the vessel to get unwieldy very quickly in dirty weather.  Also, while this sail type is very efficient in light winds, that same feature can make it too powerful in heavy air.  Anyway, I’ve been studying the art and it is bothering me that there is no rigging holding up the lateen spar!  At least not that I can see.  Invisible elven rope perhaps?  So I decided to go and look at the art on the cards again and noticed something I hadn’t seen before.

 

While Dreamchaser has the traits “Gray Havens. Ship”, the other two ships we can see in Dreamchaser’s fleet, Silver Wing and Dawn Star, have the traits “Gondor.  Ship.”  So I am changing my opinion that we won’t be visiting Umbar from probably not to quite possibly so.  Have to hedge my bets.  :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

Incidentally, the central ship – a boat really – on the box art isn’t on any of the player cards spoiled so far.

Ok, that explains a lot.

I actually teamed up with several people to report him and get him banned. It was especially annoying when he INSISTED that he had a RIGHT to use these forums, rather than just a privilege, even after I showed him the terms of use that explained that he could be banned for his attitude that always got on people's nerves.

Good job. Only now...

You're the worst, MNT is a champion, with good analysis, good custom cards and is funny as heck.

I guess I'm helping derail the topic now, but I'm with joezim007 100%. Being active and posting interesting custom creations does not make up for an unpleasant attitude. It's obvious from other posts here that different users have different ideas of what constitutes bad behaviour, so I'm not sure there's much point to speaking ill of the banned. If at all, a discussion on decent conduct on the forums could take place in a new topic.

So... how about that artwork? Pretty beautiful isn't it?

Does anyone know if parts of Númenor are still above sea level in the lore or whether Matt and Caleb are taking some liberties? I know some places in Beleriand remain in the Third Age, but I had the impression Númenor was completely underwater. It's an awesome idea either way - I guess they won't throw in actual Númenoreans as allies or heroes, but there's plenty of opportunity for events and attachments that refer back to their lost civilisation.

I think only the tip of Meneltarma is above sea level. I don't know if they plan on going there, but I guess they could make it a big mountain with undead enemies of whatever.

The legend of the Dunedain has that the top of Meneltarma did not sink, there were attempts to find it but none succeeded. On the slopes of Meneltarma were the graves of Numenorean Kings, so maybe there is a story that can be made of that

At the printers.  Probably a Q1 release.
