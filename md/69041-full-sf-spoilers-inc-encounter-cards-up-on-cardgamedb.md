Some very powerful cards in this set. I'lll have to play with them but playing cards for free just seams stupid to me.

I do like the Mirviour thing though. Dose anyone know what that is sounds liek a "real" Tolkin thing.

 

This card is bonkers (I'm not crying OP, it is just super powerful)

And here lies Dunhere, we really tried to make him work.. but now powercreep has rendered him useless.

 I wouldn't consider Hands Upon the Bow to be power creep since it's essentially the same thing as comparing A Test of Will to Eleanor (which was recently discussed in another thread). Just depends on if you want that ability all the time for free or if you want it to come up occasionally and pay a cost of 1. Plus it's a different sphere and I don't think a lot of solo players use Tactics all that much except for some splash cards. I personally haven't used Dunhere or Eleanor since the Mirkwood cycle began, but I only play 2 player games (or pilot 2 decks when playing solo).

 You can add "ranged" via Dunedain Cache to Dunhere and then he got +2 Attack with Hands upon the bow.

think about it

Or you could put the the Cache on Hama and have a much better character.  And this combination requires less spheres.

 

Hands Upon the Bow is a miserable card for Dunhere.  It's just a +1 attack.

Its also a quick strike equivalent for him

What is disappointing to me is secrecy.

While this new secrecy card is really really good, I was hoping to see a card like we did with the Eagles at the end of Mirjkwood that gels the entire secrecy block into a coherent deck.

I hope that the we see more secrecy cards in the future and it is not going to be a lost mechanic like we see all the time aGoT and CoC

Exactly… this is the combo. Add Quick Strike and you are able to remove threats b4 the quest resolution happens.

Opps I screwed up in reading this card.. this card "IS" quickstrike. As it says

"Action: Exhaust a character you control with ranged to  **IMMEDIATELY **  declare it as an attacker (and resolve its attack) against an enemy in the staging area. It gets +1 [Attack] during this attack. "

So yeah it is even more powerful that I thought and much easier to combo off Hama (who is so powerful a hero it is just crazy) Thing about Hama is that he will just get better and better and better as more tactic events come out So unlike other heroes he will be relevant forever and is near immune to powercreep unless that exact ability is duplicated or improved
