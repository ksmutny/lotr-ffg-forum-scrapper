Hey everyone,

Maybe I’m being dense and totally missed it, but what constitutes “discovering” a treasure?

In the hobbit rule sets the first condition of adding a treasure is that it is “discovered” but discovery isn’t specified.  Is it only drawing off the encounter deck?  Or does it include shadow cards dealt and revealed?  Does it include discarding as per the instructions on quest 2b of ‘We Must Away’?

thanks

The quest card will tell you if you've officially "discovered" a treasure. Here are some examples:

Then when you play a subsequent quest in the Hobbit saga (with the same heroes with which you discovered the treasure), you can include the treasures in your deck.

Treasures will never be in the encounter deck. They are player cards with player card backs.

The above answer is correct. To add a little more, the Over Hill and Under Hill treasures will not feature in the first quest at all. Then only if they are discovered can they be used for the rest of the saga.

For On the Doorstep, all the treasures are included in the Setup instructions of either the first or second quest.
