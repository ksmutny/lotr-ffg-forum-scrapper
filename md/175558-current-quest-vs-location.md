# [Current Quest vs Location?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/175558-current-quest-vs-location/)

Are they the same thing??? Cards like Legolas says to add progress tokens to the current quest after defeating an enemy. Is the current quest the actually quest cards or are the location that you have traveled to? Same as Escort of Edoras, does his ability only apply to the actual quest or can it apply to a current location?

 

Thanks!

The active location will always act as a 'buffer' for progress that would be placed on the quest, so cards like Legolas (which says to place progress 'on the current quest') will need to place progress on the active location first.  The only exception to this is when a card specifically states 'bypass the active location.'

 

The 'current quest' does refer to the quest card itself, the location never becomes the 'quest.'  Escort of Edoras will be discarded after a quest phase in which he participates in the quest, whether there is an active location or not.

Thank you for the clarification!
