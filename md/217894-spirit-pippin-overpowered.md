I did a game with Tonskillitis, this is an snapshot:

In this game Pippin was basic to win the game. Tonski, at the end of the game said that Wandering Took must be faqqed. I answered: 'are you saying Pippin is overpowered?' ^^

 

Earendil-Took decrease the threat of the silvan-player. Haldir can use his ability always then. And Pippin avoid enemies while i get pipes and hobbit senses.

 

In this game i had to use Pippin ability several times, Haldir had no weapons, so combat was slow. We win finally.

 

The question is: first time i see Pippin's ability usefull.

 

I post here this thread, because i dont list the deck. However, if you want to see it, here is the link: http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/880/hobbit-spirit-2.0 [http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/880/hobbit-spirit-2.0]

 

PD: When i finally got 3 Hobbit Senses, i decreased the mate's trheat down to 0 (raising mine a lot), and i engaged all enemies, the last rounds, when it was sure we win the scenario with our willpower, at least, during 2 rounds.

You can answer in this picture: Naith Guide is ready to defend, so doesn't hurry Pippin's ability.

 

--> Sure? There is one shadow that discard ally if he is the defending character. Better not risk

I don't understand. He has to raise his threat to take control of the Wandering Took. Isn't that contrary to what Haldir wants? And then you have to raise your threat with Pippin to keep enemies at bay causing you to attract more enemies? You'd have to be seeing three-or-greater threat enemies every turn just to keep afloat with Merry.

Song of Earendil allows the Wandering Took to be used to transfer threat from one deck to another at will.

 

Deck 1 transfers Took, reduces threat by 3, Deck 2 raises threat by 3.

Deck 1 triggers Song of Earendil to raise threat by 1 and reduce Deck 2's threat by 1.

Deck 2 transfers Took back, reduces threat by 3, Deck 1 raises threat by 3.

Net result, Deck 1 has gained 1 threat and Deck 2 has lost 1 threat. Repeat as often as you like.

 

And obviously he has other threat reduction besides Merry.

That's an interesting combo. Still a lot of cards to get both your threats down to where you don't have to take any mandatory engagements, but seems like good cheeky fun. Thanks for explaining.

How does it do against a harder quest? You can't say it's overpowered and post a screenshot of one of the easiest quests in the game :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]. You are just killing 1 enemy each turn with Haldir so the enemies will pile up. If this were a different quest you could reveal 2-3 enemies with 20-30 engagement cost on the first turn. What then? You raise by 6 and let Haldir kill one... next turn you reveal another enemy, and must raise by 6 again. It's not sustainable.

I don't think Mndela was being serious when he said he's overpowered. 

 

...R-right?

In the screenshot posted above, shouldn't the Goblin in the staging area have engaged the Haldir player?

His threat is 13 at that point isn't it?

## 10 [Mndela on April 21, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/217894-spirit-pippin-overpowered/?do=findComment&comment=2180172)

Exactly, Haldir is 13 threat thanks to earendil-took, so he has not to engage nothing.

I am not serious when i speak about Pippin is 'overpowered', but my mate said seriously that the combo took-earendil must be faqqed. My conclusion is he says spirit pippin is overpowered. Isn't? ^^

 

About Seastan comments: well, this deck and spirit Pippin is not overpowered. Atm i have tried it in easy scenarios, the good new is that we have a good use and useful for spirit Pippin. The question is if it works in harder scenarios. This deck needs some round to build it, not always is perfect. I think the percentatge 1/5 is only the games that it crashes. I think it is a good average.

Oh I misunderstood whose threat was whose.

As a sometime Wandering Took-Song of Earendil player myself, I must say that I believe it to be one of the most abusable combos still legal in the game. (Hat tip to Boromir shenanigans, of course.) While it's great to see Spirit Pippin find some use, it probably falls on the other combo for whatever real power this deck may have.
