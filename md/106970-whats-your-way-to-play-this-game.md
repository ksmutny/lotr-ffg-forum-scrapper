Hi, first sorry my poor english. It's not my native language...

 

I am interested to know how you play this game.

 

I guess some of you are interested to create a deck for each adventure individually. Your goal is to win every adventure and wait for the next one.

Or create versatile decks that can win most of the adventures, and you replay the old ones with these decks. 

Or maybe, you like to create different standard decks and then, depending on the adventure, you play with one or another.

Or you prefer search the web for a pre-created deck and use it in your games.

 

And how you choose an adventure to play?, Randomly?, when it's released you play until you win it? you create a deck and play all the released adventures in order?,...

 

Personally, I do it as follows:

- First, i choose randomly 10 different adventures. I decide what to play first and will play the others by release order.

- Then, i select 5 combinations of spheres and 5 heroes randomly among the least played, i choose one heroe and one 1 combination and choose freely the other 2 heroes matching the combination chosen. My choice depends on the 10 selected adventures.

- I create a deck thinking to win the most of the 10 adventures and the obligation to win the first one. If not, i remake the deck until achieve it.

- Finally i write the stats (% wins, adventure scores, deck list, own rating,...) in an excel sheet, and start again: i choose randomly 10 different adventures, bla, bla, bla,...

 

Doing this, I think the game becomes more replayable, and powers one of its main characteristics: decks building. Versatile decks (One deck for 10 different adventures), power decks (the winning of the first adventure is a must, and it can be very hard), thematic decks (depending on the difficulty of the adventures and the variety of heroes). 

 

What do you think? How do you play this amazing game ?

I mainly play solo (normal solo, not retarded multi-handed) or with 3 players. What we do is play with "decks". IMO this is all about deck building. The game itself is very flawed but you can sculpt the player experience through deck building. You can make decks that will crush everything, or decks that fit a theme or weak deck to give you more a challenge etc etc.

 

For myself this is the crux of how I play. I see the cards and I think of a synergy that I feel would make a cool deck, build the deck.. then play it vs the quests.

 

As for quest selection... I tend to just pick the ones I have enjoyed the most. They come out so fast and so often and I play them as I get them.. but once I have a fun deck I like I usually go back and play my fav quests. Usually quests that do not require a deck specific  trick.. like say watcher in the water. So it isn't really random.

 

But yeah, if I had to pin it down I would say I am a deck builder. That is how I play the game, the quests are just places to test the decks and I play them all, but have my favorites.

I play solo (multi-handed, not boring unbalanced classic solo :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] )

 

I play themed decks, and will think about how my band of heroes have come together for the quest, and specifically use allies, events and attachments that relate to one of the heroes in some way.  I build the decks with versatility in mind to be able to play through an entire cycle with little to no modification.

Solo is not unbalanced, it just has a different balance.

I play very similarly with two hands/decks and use the same decks for all quests with sideboards for both of them. I probably have less theme than you but try my best to keep my decks thematic whilst still powerful! :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

Love to hear others playing in a similar way to me and advocating two handed play! (all respect to solo players but it is definitely not for me, the encounter cards do not combo well enough coming out that slowly)

Check mine out and post yours if you have time!

I was just having a little fun with the previous post to mine :-)  I'm a big fan of Ranged and Sentinel interactions and love using a Hammer/Anvil setup

I used to randomly play interesting quests two handed.

I recently started a solo play through, meaning a started at core and am going through as far as I can get. I recently changed decks because I had an idea and wanted to see if it would work.

I also have a weekly multiplayer game that is doing a proper campaign run, dead heroes stay dead, recording scores etc.

I like the second way I've been playing because it lets me quickly play lots of quests, I haven't played them all yet and I feel like I'm missing a lot. I spent a huge chunk of money on this game all at once and so have only now begun playing through it all.

The game stays set up on my bedroom floor so it's more accessible for me.

PS, your English is good, no need to worry. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I play new quests until I beat them or it gets a little old playing the same one over and over. I really like to play and build somewhat thematic decks (dwarves in Dwarrowdelf, Gondor for the last expansion, hobbits for Black Riders) but then to actually beat quests or keep things exciting I focus on building powerful decks to beat certain scenarios at times. And then when deciding what quest to play I either play a favorite, or go back and play ones I haven't played in a long time. I also like to build a deck or two and play several quests in a row to experience more of a story with minimal or no deck building in between.

I agree with you booored!
