My wish for a contract in the final adventure pack. It would be based upon this passage.

 ‘Yes, that’s so,’ said Sam. ‘And we shouldn’t be here at all, if we’d known more about it before we started. But I suppose it’s often that way. The brave things in the old tales and songs, Mr. Frodo: adventures, as I used to call them. I used to think that they were things the wonderful folk of the stories went out and looked for, because they wanted them, because they were exciting and life was a bit dull, a kind of a sport, as you might say. But that’s not the way of it with the tales that really mattered, or the ones that stay in the mind. Folk seem to have been just landed in them, usually – their paths were laid that way, as you put it. But I expect they had lots of chances, like us, of turning back, only they didn’t. And if they had, we shouldn’t know, because they’d have been forgotten. We hear about those as just went on – and not all to a good end, mind you; at least not to what folk inside a story and not outside it call a good end. You know, coming home, and finding things all right, though not quite the same – like old Mr. Bilbo. But those aren’t always the best tales to hear, though they may be the best tales to get landed in! I wonder what sort of a tale we’ve fallen into?’

The Tales that Really Mattered A

You may not include more than one copy of any card in your deck. 

Action: You may exhaust this card to shuffle a card from your discard pile into your deck.

When there is at least 1 card from each of the nine cycles in play or in your discard pile you may flip this card. 

 

The Tales that Really Mattered B

Place nine resource tokens on this card. You may discard a resource token from this card to ready it.

Action: You may exhaust this card to shuffle a card from your discard pile into your deck.

Action: You may exhaust this card to choose one hero you control to gain a resource.

Action: You may exhaust this card and discard one random card from your hand to heal 2 damage from among characters you control.

Action: You may exhaust this card and discard 1 card from the top of your deck to draw 2 cards.

Action: You may exhaust this card and shuffle x cards from your hand into your deck to reduce your threat by x.

"But I expect they had lots of chances, like us, of turning back, only they didn’t. And if they had, we shouldn’t know, because they’d have been forgotten."

This contract is meant to reward the players who stuck with the game from the beginning, and if they can prove it, they will get some helpful abilities in the game!
