How does Stand Together work exactly?  For example say you have a Hill Troll and a Warg attacking you and you have Gimli, Thalin, and Gondorian Spearman readied.  You play Stand Together and declare all 3 as defenders.  Do the attack still resolve seperately or does the total damage from all enemies get subtracted from the total defense of the characters?  Also I assume that the damage is determined by the player and can split up by the defenders but dont know if this is true. Thanks.

You may declare multiple defenders each time an Enemy attacks when Stand Together has been played on a player - those defenders still need to exhaust to defend, though.  Yes, you allocate the damage amongst the defenders as you see fit.
