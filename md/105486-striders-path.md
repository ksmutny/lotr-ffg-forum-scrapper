When you use Strider's Path on a location, you don't count that location's threat right?  Just seems almost too powerful.  When there isn't any active location, you can get rid of a 4 threat location AND stop its nasty effect.  

 

Thanks

sure,  if there is no active location.   If there is an active location though -which is most of the time-   you trade one effect for another (hopefully less nasty) effect, and one threat cost in the staging area for another threat cost in the staging area.   It's allright,  I'm not sure it's better than Secret Paths though.

Yes, you are correct. It can be pretty powerful. This is what made Thror's Map almost broken before it got errata. Strider's Path is good at the beginning of game when there is no active location, otherwise, it is just helpful to avoid travel effects and possibly exchange active location for a lower threat one.

Strider's Path is a great card in the lore sphere for location management. I am a huge fan of it when I face encounter decks with around a half dozen location cards with nasty Travel effects. But if they are just locations without much Travel effects then I agree with awp823, Secret Paths [http://hallofbeorn.com/HallOfBeorn_deploy/Cards/Details/Secret-Paths-Core] may be your better option. I will actually be seeking Secret Paths today while scouting through The Long Dark.
