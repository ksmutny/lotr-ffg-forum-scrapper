Hard to pass judgment on the decks since we are only seeing the first of two which are meant to work together, but only having one copy of The Tree People and one copy of Galadhrim Mintstrel stands out to me.  Perhaps the other two copies of each are in the other deck.

I was recently thinking about creating a solo silvan deck which will feature Celeborn, Elrond and Galadriel, all 4 sphered popping silvans and 3 sphered recycling silvan events. Need to find the strength to actually put it together and give it a spin.

I like that they haven't forgotten about the second breakfast articles, but I really was expecting to see a new spoiled card. Seriously, how hard is it to just slap the image of a new card in an article and call it a day? For being the article that finally ended the 1 month hiatus without any news, this was pretty meh. Tracker can come up with this deck, or even a better one, but maybe I'm just being whiny. It's just that I really want to see more preview articles instead of "X has been released".

I'm tempted to call this deck "Family Vacation".

The follow-on deck will probably include the grandchildren (Elrohir and Elladan) plus the son-in-law (Aragorn)

> Hard to pass judgment on the decks since we are only seeing the first of two which are meant to work together, but only having one copy of The Tree People and one copy of Galadhrim Mintstrel stands out to me.  Perhaps the other two copies of each are in the other deck.

I was thinking the same thing. Even if the other 2 copies of each are in the other deck, this deck is weird. He maximizes allies and events, but only has 1 copy of each of those two cards? Silly. Also, those 2 cards are the only Lore cards in the deck. I know Elrond can pay for any ally, but he's also putting a burden on the other 2 heroes to pay for all the events and attachments. At least throw a Vilya or 2 in there so he'll have a Spirit icon to help with the Spirit attackments and events.

Considering the extreme lack of Lore cards in this deck, you have to assume that the other deck will feature Lore much more heavily, which means we'll definitely see Haldir, and potentially also see Mirlonde in there to make sure they can afford all the Lore cards. I also assume Legolas will be in there. It'll almost definitely be Legolas and Haldir, but it could potentially be Glorfindel instead of Mirlonde, but due to only having 2 Light of Valinor and so many Spirit cards in this deck, I assume he'll skip Glorfindel and Spirit altogether in the next deck.

In general, I have a very tough time judging the Second Breakfast decks because they are willing to go 1x or 2x with so many cards to create more versatility and I hate doing anything less than 3x for almost any card, even uniques, unless I know that I don't really NEED it... but at that point I tend to just take it out of the deck to make room for cards that I do need. Then again, they are limited to 1 core set, so the lack of 3x for the Spirit cancellation events is understandable.

I don't know. I'm just not impressed, especially since they didn't spoil any cards from The Antlered Crown to build it (like they did with the Gondor deck that spoiled Gondorian Shield). I hope the second deck at least has one spoiler.

I was expecting one spoiled card at the end which would be in the next deck but now I think that we will get no more Silvan cards in the last AP. It's still nice that they release these articles for those interested in deck building ideas but I agree, one spoiled card would be great! ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

Well, at least we got SOMETHING. I kinda liked the deck. I think Silvan has an interesting mechanic. Cool.

Also, I highly doubt the next deck would be Aragorn and the twins. It's called "The Spear of Mirkwood." So obviously Legolas will be one of the heroes, and the other two are almost assuredly Mirlonde and Haldir. Although, I guess one of them could be Glorfindel. But I guess we'll see.

Goodness, I guess I am desperate for a spoiler. I'm trying to predict a deck!

Oh Silvans are great don't get me wrong just the deck that they posted is terrible, seen plenty of better ones here on the forums made by users.

The problem with this is that this is not what people want. Players have become quite good at coming up with decks in the last 2 years or so, and don't need the developers to give them to us. If these articles were more of an afterthought, a little something between the more frequent news, or if the decks were, well, much more powerful, that'd be fine, but after waiting for a month for any news (or rather, since the 3rd of November, when we got the last actual news) getting this is disappointing in the least. Anyway, I'm not mad, since I just got my TRD and have been playing around that, it's just that I don't care in the least for this article.

I haven't found 3-sphere Silvan decks very effective (unless you include Blue Mountain Trader). I've toyed around a bit, but I'll definitely give Elrond/Galadriel/Spirit Glorfindel a shot and team them up with Celeborn/Elladan/Elrohir. That should be the least cumbersome setup in my opinion - makes it easier to actually get cards into play.

I think Tri-sphere Silvan is very effective since O Lorien can reduce the cost of which ever sphere you need it to.

It also lets you have the highest concentration of new Silvan allies and events. Try it out!

The team I've tried first is Celeborn/Galadriel/Haldir. They make a really effective staging area attack deck if you Good Harvest-in a couple bows

I believe you can't use Good Harvest to pay for cards that have a sphere icon not present in the ones your heroes have.

> I believe you can't use Good Harvest to pay for cards that have a sphere icon not present in the ones your heroes have.

Gizlivadi is correct. You still need a sphere match to play the cards - you can just pay for them from any hero's resource pool. This is ultimately why I don't use A Good Harvest.

Hmm, I thought the ruling was just that A Good Harvest can't be used with 0-cost cards if you don't have a resource match. You have to actually pay for cards to get the match (as per the FAQ). Was there another ruling somewhere?

## 17 [Teamjimby on December 12, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/128913-the-woodland-realms-unite-part-one/?do=findComment&comment=1365326)

I'm pretty sure you can use Good Harvest to pay for out of sphere cards that don't cost 0.  Radagast can do it for creatures.  FAQ says:

Q: Can I used A Good Harvest (AtS 10) to play a 0 cost
card without a resource match?
A: No. A Good Harvest only allows you to spend
resources for the named sphere, a resource match is
still needed to play cards with no resource cost.

 

They specifically say it's needed to play cards with no cost.  They could have said it's needed to play any card, but specifically said cards with no cost.

My Silvan deck is fairly successful using Celeborn/Haldir/Legolas. Good Harvest is fairly important to my deck, but I learned that without O Lorien in the opening hand I'm pretty much crippled. I generally only play 3-4 player games thought.

## 19 [joezim007 on December 12, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/128913-the-woodland-realms-unite-part-one/?do=findComment&comment=1365606)

Yes, you can use Good Harvest on non-free cards that don't have a sphere match with any of your heroes. I've played several different tri-sphere Silvan decks and the only card I've used that I would count as resource smoothing is Elrond's ability to pay for any ally. You could also count Nenya, Vilya, and Sword that was Broken (I had Lore Aragorn in my first Silvan deck before Haldir was released), because they also grant those heroes an additional sphere, but I've never touched Errand-Rider, Blue Mountain Trader, or Good Harvest for my Silvan decks.

O' Lorien is something that if I don't have in my starting hand I start the game in a petty pessimistic frame of mind. It's the heart of my Silvan deck. Currently Celeborn,Galadriel (and Bifur as my son and partner have pinched both Mirlonde and Legolas).

I'm also a bit screwed on resource generation as again my 'darling' son refuses to budge from Steward of Gondor. Instead of good harvest I'm using Tighten Our Belts and Gaining Strength. I find the latter works particularly well with Bifurs ability for a first turn boost though I do feel a bit guilty having an axe wielder in a Silvan deck.

Yeah, Good Harvest just says "Name a sphere." so you can choose one you're not playing with.

Yea. Everyone knew that, but the issue was related to the FAQ answer that was pasted in here. 0 cost cards still need a sphere match because GH only allows the resources to be used differently, so some were not sure if you still needed a sphere match with cards that have a cost.

Hi everyone,

I've ask to Caleb directly:

 

"Hi Enrico,
The sphere that you name when you play A Good Harvest can be any sphere in the game. It does not have to match any of your heroes.
Cheers,
Caleb"

 

Hope could help!

This has been established for a while: A Good Harvest can be used to allow you to buy cards that do not belong to a sphere that you control, but the card has to cost at least one. 0-cost cards of other spheres cannot be brought into play with A Good Harvest.

If neutral was a sphere, then it would require you to have a neutral hero to play neutral cards.

Page 12 of the rulebook:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Paying for Neutral Cards

Neutral cards, which belong to no sphere of influence,

require no resource match to play. This means that they

can be payed for with resources from any hero’s pool.

Also, when paying for a neutral card, a player may

combine resources from heroes with different resource

icons

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Spelled out pretty straight-forward.

Neutral cards can only be payed with any hero´s resources specifically because they have no sphere.

> If neutral was a sphere, then it would require you to have a neutral hero to play neutral cards.

This is not true, and if it where, this is a statement the other way around. The designers decided one way, but they could easily fix it and decide the other way around. Neutral cards require no resource match, so neutral can easily be judged a sphere, but just that it still doesn't need a resource match.

## 32 [Teamjimby on December 17, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/128913-the-woodland-realms-unite-part-one/?do=findComment&comment=1370199)

Are there any cards affected by the ruling besides Stand and Fight?  It technically affects Good Harvest, but you would never need to name neutral as a sphere anyway.

You miss the point entirely. It was not a rule arguement.

> Are there any cards affected by the ruling besides Stand and Fight?  It technically affects Good Harvest, but you would never need to name neutral as a sphere anyway.

 

A Good Harvest is affected when trying to use the new Gandalf hero's resources to pay for a card in your hand.

 

Anyone who is truly upset that Neutral isn't technically a sphere is only upset because it creates odd exceptions to some cards like A Good Harvest and Stand and Fight. We don't like exceptions that aren't explicitly stated on the card, so we get upset. It makes way more sense for neutral to be considered the absence of a sphere than to be a separate sphere with alternate rules. Neutral cards have no sphere symbol on them for this reason.

Well you did call it a ruling earlier. But a ruling is an extrapolation upon existing material. As neutral is clearly defined as "not a sphere" in the rulebook it cannot be a ruling as it is a defined point.

> If neutral was a sphere, then it would require you to have a neutral hero to play neutral cards.

As good a purpose as anyone.

 

What is the purpose forcing all undefended attacks to damage only heroes?

What is the purpose of putting a shadow card on all engaged enemies at the start of the combat phase instead of the moment they attack?

What is the purpose of not letting encounter keywords trigger when they are merely added to the staging area?

 

I could go on. I won´t.

The rules are as they are and they work just fine.

If Stand and Fight had the text "is not limited to any sphere" or something to that effect would this even be an issue?

Would rather that the card(s?) in question be discussed than the purpose of a core rule.

The purpose I asked about is purpose of you misinterpeting my words rather that purpose of the rules, but whatever floats your boat.

So pray tell o´ wise one: what is the purpose of your words?

Preferably condensed into something longer than a one-sentence response.

 

That was not a challenge to make it a two- or three-sentence response but rather a coherent explanation, which conveys a semblance (if not the whole) purpose of your original input.

See what I did there? I just don't like the decision, because that's what it is. They could have easily decided otherwise.

(and I just want Gandalf to have his own sphere, that's my secret reason)
