Hi forum,

i just wanted to ask if it is possible to create a new encounter deck with the existing objektive cards?

Me and my friend like this game a lot, but since we are playing card games for many years and are very good at it we find it too easy

with our current decks. we loose to no quest (except for rosgobbel, since you have to sideboard healing mechanic in order to win against).

Even Massing isn't a problem no more (with the release of kazaadum). It's the only scenario where we loose 1/5 maybe 1/4 of our games.

Now we thought about creating our own encounter deck, but we find no solution or guideline of how many cards the encounter deck should have

or how many treachery cards and how many monsters we should take in.

also the powerlevel of some cards differ widly and since their is no ranking system (which should exist in our opinion) on each card it is difficult to create a hard encounter deck which pushes us on our limit!!!

has anyone the same problems or thought about a ranking system for difficulty of cards (like difficulty of scenarios)? could anyone give me some thoughts about this?

finally i hope that ffg reads this post and thinks about release some mechanic to make it possible to use all existing cards in different objectives.

cya

well the problem of saying cards/enounter decks should have this or that is that you want these things to homebrew your own things.....FFG or indeed most people are only interested in the proper rules and product therefore if ffg see no reason to rank cards they wont----and seeing as enouncter decks are set there is no reason for them to do so

if you are creating your own encounter decks then surely you are already creating your own content and are free to do as you want? there are no guidlines on what cards should be in an encounter deck becasue the only people who need to know this are the developers of the game

(or i may have understood you wrong- you keep referring to objectives however do you mean OBJETIVE CARDS? or QUEST CARDS?  it isnt clear if you do or mean something else)

thx for your opinion. maybe your are right. but i believe someone out there must also feel that this game is too easy the way it is developed

and i think a custom use for an encounter deck could be very refreshing for the game.

it would also be more encouring to not only building decks for the good guys, also for the bad and you could use all cards (more or less) for playing the game.

i don't like the concept of playing one objective, beat it without a problem and then wait for another month till ffg releases a new easy quest.

PS: i mean objective cards. sry for the false writing

I've not really had the patience to think through making entirely new scenarios, but I have thought of swapping out some encounter sets in favour of others when constructing the encounter deck for specific scenarios. Passage through Mirkwood is one that I like, and feel should have been used more often, so perhaps would use that in something. Spiders of Mirkwood would probably do well in Return to Mirkwood, too...

well to add my personal info into my above point- i find that making custom things spoils the exitement of the official product- but thats just me

also if you're looking for someone like minded to you id seek glaurung- he also finds this game too easy

 What about just mixing scenarios? For example, slide the Hills of Emyn Muil encounter card randomly in between the Hunt For Gollum stack. Then shuffle the Emyn Muil encounter deck in with the Hunt For Gollum encounter deck. Now it's harder to predict what will come out of the encounter deck and it dilutes the deck, making it harder to find the objective cards. Thematically, you are searching through the Hills of Emyn Muil for signs of Gollum.

Personally, I agree with richsabre that playing with the official decks is more appealing to me, but then, I don't have the problem of the game being too easy. Also, I've only played up through The Hills of Emyn Muil (even though I own all the Shadows of Mirkwood packs) so I have plenty official scenarios to keep me occupied.

Yes you can have some experiment with encounter deck why not? When i play i remove from encounter deck some stupid weak card to make game more difficult. Also you can reveal additional card in staging phase but in the case of quest with difficult 6 and more it can be deadly. Balance of the game is so fragile if you try some changed even small ones the game going to be brutal.

You cannot lose? So i think both of you have at least 2 core set, play very good combine together decks and both deck use spirit. 6 Test of will , 6 Dwarfen tombs ans so on. + You use Bervur, Trackers, Gimly. OF course you cannot lose or you lose 1 game from 5 cose you have a bad starting hand.But this is problem of this game ans i speak about this all the time since begin. GAME DIDN PROVIDE ENOUGH CHALLENGE FOR ADVANCE PLAYERS!!!

Nightmare mode is joke.Nothing special. So what i do? We play some restriction. No Beravur or ability limited once per turn. No Gimly.No Will of the west.No Zigil.No tracker.

And play 1 sphere only once! If you choose spirit sphere i cannot use it. IS mean in 4 players game we can play only mono decks.This make game really interesting with out rules changed. You will still win but the game will be really hard sometimes and every game you will balance on the edge. Try it if you want.

About experiment with encounter deck i dont know cose in can destroy all balance of the game. But try it why not.
