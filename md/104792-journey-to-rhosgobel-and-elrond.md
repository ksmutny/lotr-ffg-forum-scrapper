In the second stage, the rule is that any card used to heal must be discarded--does anyone know if that means Elrond, since he automatically increases healing anywhere in the game whenever it's played, must be discarded as soon as any body else heals?  That seems overly harsh!  

 

Thoughts?

If you choose to use his ability, then yes.  However, Responses are optional.

Yeah, I have actually used him to heal that extra wound (because it was essential that I did) and then discarded him and still won the game! Pretty lucky though. Usually not a great idea!

When I first did that quest I thought I was slick by telling myself I was gonna use Glorfindel's healing ability to make this quest twice as easy. Then I read the quest effect  :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]
