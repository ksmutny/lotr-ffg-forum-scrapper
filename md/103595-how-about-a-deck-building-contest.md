Would you like a Deck-Building-Contest?

I could imagine that it will be a nice variety.

 

I will list my first ideas but they need to be discussed of course:

 

- every player can post 1 of his decks (within a week for example)

- then every player can give some points to his favourite decks (we need to develop a scoring-system)

- noone can choose his own deck

 

 

What do you think?...Would you like to share in?

(if it runs good, we can start a 2-Deck-Contest in the same way)

I'd rather Duel! [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/103579-duel/]

I would say that instead of just voting, we should determine a set of quests to play and judge by score and/or win/loss ratio. But then to be fair we'd need just one person to play all the decks, which would need to be someone who has way too much time on his hands. Does someone like that exist here? I know most people on these forums seem to have a lot more time than I do to play, but not necessarily enough to test several decks on several quests in a short span of time.

 

Even then, the person who plays might not understand the way the deck is designed to be played and can bring down a good deck... so in order to fix that, we'd have to have 2-3 players who each test every deck and then get an average between them. Finding 3 people with way too much time on their hands would be even harder.

 

Maybe we should just stick to voting :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

I am struggling a bit to understand why we would need one person for this. Is not the person who builds the deck better at playing it?

No reason to make it more complicated than necessary :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

After thinking longer about my idea, I see that it`s more difficult than I thought...

 

I wanted a Deckbuilding-Contest because I think it is very interesting to see the best decks/combos of other good players (like you ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]).

I mean there are so many ways to create decks/combos, that noone can figure out all of them.

 

If we play Quests with the deck and only rate the scores there are some points I dislike:

- we only see the Heroes...not the whole deck ---> so noone can take a new idea and improve it

- even with 3 games in a row it is controlled by luck of course

- good decks/combos don't have to be the best options for scoring

 

But I noticed that you can`t understand each deck before seeing it in action...and this would make it more complicated than useful.

*best example is this deck of mine: Taking Initiative - Deck [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/103589-taking-initiative-deck/]

I like this idea, but would support having a restriction based on theme, expansions, or a certain card (e.g. Taking Initiative) for the decks. That way you can have different categories worth 0-10 points that add up to a final score. For instance,

 * Theme: how true to the contest theme was the deck?
 * Creativity: did the entrant come up with a fresh way of representing the theme?
 * Playability: how did the deck handle playing through the scenario/scenarios?

The playability could be objective (rank all entries based on self-reported completion of Anduin, or some other quest/quests), and then the other categories could be voted on.

 

If my suggestion is too similar to the other contest thread that's active right now, you can ignore me.
