Hang on a minute... in the middle of the article Lukas seems to imply that you reduce your threat when a hero dies, is this true?

i dont think so. What I believe he was saying was that at one point they were thinking of having the secrecy mechanic triggered by the number of heroes you currently had. Therfore if you lost a hero you could use secrecy cards. I don't think he was saying your threat level suddenly reduced.

I have a question about the card revealed in the article though "Needful to Know". What happens when the card revealed has a threat value of X?

X = 0 . Can't find a rule for it, but this is how almost every game runs.

I am inclined to second guciomir view, but wow does it screw "Needful to Know"

Well, so would a treachery or an objective, would it not? So it may be useful to scout the card first (Henamarth, etc.) or use this as a scouting tool. If it were for the cost of 0 (applying the secrecy discount) it might not be too bad to know the encounter card even when you need to raise the threat by 1, even though there is a card that does just that without the raise, so you either gamble or scout I say.

im guessing there may be more scouting cards coming up to use alongside this
