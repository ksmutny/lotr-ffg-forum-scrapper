hi guys!

 

i wish to make a GONDOR deck with the trait leadership (and command.

 

So a purple and red deck...

 

I generally play 3 hero with my friends so i need these....I have tried with BEREGOND, BOROMIR (version +1 attack if he has atleast 1 res) and IMRAHIL but perhaps there is a better combination...

 

so first question:

 

1)which 3 heroes are the best best for a GONDOR red/purple deck?

 

second question:

 

2) which cards fill at best with these 3 heroes?

 

thanks for answers

Maybe put this in the deck building section?

Well if you want all 3 heroes to be Gondor, you have little choice.

 

Boromir (either sphere)

Prince Imrahil

Beregond

 

...As you already said.

 

That's a mighty starting threat of 32 though. If you're willing to use a non-Gondor hero, I'd consider replacing Imrahil with Theodred. Hey- he's a young heir to the throne of Rohan out cutting his chops by aiding their allies to the East before Theodred succombs to the poisoned words of Grima!

 

Otherwise... not sure what you might be asking about the heroes!

 

As for cards... The Gondor trait is fairly well developed.

 

ALLIES

Defender of Ramas is great

Errand Rider is good to keep your resources spread out

Faramir and Denethor (pending the resources to pay for them... Steward!)

Gondorion spearmen (a bit redundant with Beregond and the spear now)

Guard and Squire of the Citadel are relatively affordable dudes

 

ATTACHMENTs

the Steward

Visionary Leadership

Gondorion shield

Spear of the Citadel

 

EVENTS

Behind Strong Walls

Gondorion Discipline

For Gondor!

 

There's a few others, but those are the ones I used

Tactics Boromir is more powerful than Leadership Boromir, but you lose some of the synergy of giving allies +1 attack. Also, a pure Gondor Tactics/Leadership deck will be high threat, so having an ability that raises your threat more isn't exactly prudent, but if you have other players who are willing to help keep your threat low, go for it.

 

Otherwise, you can technically use any Tactics/Leadership hero and give them Steward of Gondor to make them Gondorian. And the Visionary leadership would go on him since he's getting more of the resources. If you're looking to lower your threat Gloin and Theodred are great options because they can give themselves resources, which helps guarantee we have some for Visionary Leadership. Sam Gamgee is another good Leadership hero and is a great quester.

 

As for Tactics options: Legolas and Thalin are both great options because they can help all the players (ranged and/or weakening enemies)

 

If you're planning on using a lot of Gondorian allies, I'd personally stick with Leadership Boromir anyway just to get more attack on your allies.

 

As for other cards. WWPDSteven has a pretty decent list. Sadly, some of the best Gondor characters (in my opinion) are the rangers in Lore, but if you are playing multiplayer, you friends with Lore decks can throw some of those guys in their decks to give them a boost.
