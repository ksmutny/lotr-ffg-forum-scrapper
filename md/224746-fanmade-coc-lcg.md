Sorta global conversion mod from LotR LCG into Call of Cthulhu on OCTGN. Very raw, with only 1 quest.

Ah, neat.  I've still never used OCTGN before.

Best thing to play LotR LCG digitally, in my opinion. Tabletop Simmulator would easily rival OCTGN if not for lack of any decent LotR LCG adaptations on TTS.
