I didn't think the next contract would be single sided. It'll be fun to see the decks that use it. 50 different cards by title?!

I am thankful that they have rounded out the master cards in spheres. The last two packs might return to neutral.

Theres surprisingly a lot of doom. I'm not overly impressed, but I am thankful that Saruman has more events to work with. With defiant challenge, saruman and his staff... you get to ready him, another hero (plus any other one character controlled by each player), all for one threat. Not a bad combo.

I'm glad also that they released this hero, so the last two will be total surprises. (I mean we know its Wilyador and Spirit aragorn but we will pretend otherwise).

Love the guarded card. Might be one of the best ones.

Overall solid pack.

Not yet from what I've seen. My guess is he acts like the Dwarven Sellsword. He's super cheap with great stats but has a forced effect like: discard  Northern Bowmaster from play unless you are engaged with an enemy. My guess is he's also ranged.

Please remind me, as I am forgetful. Does reducing the Doomed 2 card to Doomed 0 with Saruman's stuff still counts as playing a card with printed doomed for the purpose of readying him?

Amazing! I usually prefer to run decks with only one copy of each card already for variety so this contract is right up my ally, and cool to see one focused on events as I feel like they are the weakest cards out of the the three (allies and attachments are a bit more permanent) also great contract and some sweet new cards for Saruman for sure. Nice to see another guarded attachment too.

This pack looks really sweet!

That may be the best guarded card, since the willpower is guaranteed useful every round and the draw is guaranteed too. What do you guys think?

Also those doomed events are cool, are they worth it without Saruman though? 

Love that Dunedain art, he looks great. Looks like you may be forced to discard him if your not engaged with an enemy which is too bad, but hes probably free with good stats... 3 attack, and definitely ranged. I mean, hes a bowmaster and the cardfan shows a space where the keyword would fit above the text.

With regards to the guarded card, it's up there. Necklace of Girion gives the +2 WP, is neutral, non-restricted and gives an extra resource. I find that's going to be a little more versatile than a restricted, lore guarded card. However, it fishes for a location, which usually is more beneficial in solo play. Plus, if you play with bilbo or cirdan, you can get card draw equivalent to an erestor deck. 

As for the doomed cards, it scales in power with the more players you have. Which is great because nobody wants to play with someone playing a doomed deck. The more benefits for players across the board, the better. It rounds out the leadership and lore bonus cards from earlier packs -- we now have doomed cards that allows all players to: 

-Ready characters

-gain resources

-draw cards

-place damage

That combined with the new 40+threat bonuses (but let's not call it valour for whatever reason??) And you might see new play for doomed cards in decks not involving saruman.

## 28 [MikeGracey on January 11, 2020](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/304267-under-the-ash-mountains/?do=findComment&comment=3868703)

Thats a good point about the guarded card being restricted. However restricted tends to only really matter on your combat characters as they are more likely to use up their restricted slots.

Necklace of Girion is a pretty close match for sure. I would say those two are the best.

Amazon has a release date of 4/3 for the US. Not sure how reliable it is, but usually Amazon tends to overestimate release dates (originally they had it set for release in May), and considering it'll be over a month between release dates for packs, I anticipate that this is a reasonable release date.

If anyone has their hands on it early, please let us know!

This could actually be quite fun (like start with Lore Aragorn, lots of Doomed to play all his toys and other stuff, use its ability and then switch for Leadership or Tactics Aragorn; switch heroes based on how the game is going to get someone more suited to your needs, and so forth), even though there seems to be a small problem for how it works: if I discard all tokens in the first step I should discard also the damage ones, but in the end it says to move the damage tokens to the new hero. I guess what they wanted to do was discarding only the resource tokens

Resource tokens aren't directed to be placed on a hero (I do it, but the resource pool of a hero is a separate thing), so if the intent was to discard resources it should've said so.

Both would be threat cost 0 I believe, making all heroes ineligible I would assume

Then which tokens would you discard...?

Big brain play:

 * Ask your friend to play Desperate Alliance to lend you Lore Aragorn
 * Play Helm of Secrecy, choosing Spirit Pippin
 * Inform your friend that, according to the card effect, their Lore Aragorn is now part of your collection. You'll let them keep Spirit Pippin though.

I think you might even keep Spirit Pippin (the shame...), since the target of Desperate Alliance was Lore Aragorn and now it's no longer in play so the delayed effect whiffs.

Discard the damage tokens, then put them back on the new hero, just as the card directs....

From rules reference: "A resource pool is a collection of resource tokens stored near a hero card."  Since the card says "from a hero" maybe you could include them, since it doesn't say *on* a hero.  OTOH, I'm not sure what purpose is served by discarding the hero's resources while you maintain all his attachments and wounds.  Tag team for an injured hero and you get his wounds but lose his wallet?

If the current hero is exhausted, does the new hero enter ready?

Transferring from Loragorn is a great use, but transferring from Saruman to Loragorn might also save your bacon.

Since it doesn't say "printed threat" I guess Mirlonde and Folco affect this card?

I would say "don't overthink the word 'on' here."

Also, this is the greatest f-u to Erestor, hah. Big burst start, go a round or two, make sure you save those 4 resources, then when this card comes up, BAM you swap him for Galdor, get rid of the rest of the cards in your hand via some discard effects, and draw 6 more cards.

For a while I thought they just axed most of the playtesting for this game (like... a couple of cycles back) so we saw a surge in typos and fuzzy wordings that made it all the way to print.

Now I actually think it's all intentional and Caleb is trying to soften us up and stop us from caring about wording at all

Heroes with "per game" abilities:

Folco (6 or less threat), requires discard

TaEowyn (9 threat)

Galdor (9 threat)

Caldara (9 threat), requires discard

Hama (9 threat)

LoAragorn (12 threat)

Heroes with setup effects:

Smeagol (3 threat -- can't be swapped out)

Thurindir (8 threat)

TaEowyn (9 threat)

LeDenethor (8 threat)

Galdor (9 threat)

Galdor and Eowyn are on both lists.  Thurindir can be an attractive swap-in candidate in quests once there's already some side-quests in the victory display -- Rossiel could also be more attractive as a swap-in for a Victory Display deck, once some locations/enemies are in the VD.

Bombur's not on the list, but as his sole function in life is to *get* to five dwarves quickly, it would be nice to swap him out for Ori after you're already safely past that threshold.  (Other than that you'd have to live with Bombur's terrible stat distribution until you had 4 resources and a 1-per deck card).

That makes sense, but it's a thematic fail not to be able to swap out Spirit Eowyn for Tactics Eowyn!

While I would love to do that too, I have a hard time agreeing that it’s a thematic fail.  In other words, why do you believe Dernhelm should be Spirit Eowyn?  I’m going to lobby that the game needs to be extended until we get a Dernhelm hero now.

I don't see Dernhelm as Spirit Eowyn, I see Eowyn in Meduseld as Spirit Eowyn.  Tactics Eowyn is the Eowyn under Dernhelm's helm.  So changing Spirit Eowyn to Tactics Eowyn is the princess become the warrior, as the art reflects.

Of course, she eventually reverts to Spirit Eowyn for Faramir, but then it's less the Helm of Secrecy and more the mantle of Finduilas.

My favorite part will be swapping Thorin Oakenshield into Quickbeam. I just can't decide if I want him to say:

"It was me inside that Dwarf all along! And I would have gotten away with it too if not for you meddling kids!"

or

"This isn't even my final form!"

If you replace an exhausted hero with this, would the hero that takes its place be ready? I assume yes, since the carp doesn’t specify, and cards enter play in a ready state.

I'm guessing based on the theme of the card that the new hero would also enter play exhausted... but then again you throw out any semblance of theme when you do what General_Grievous did up above...🤣 So who knows.

I'm house ruling that you can swap. They're different heroes. They just have the same name.

The tactics card is Northern Bowmaster. 

Dunedain - 1 cost

0 Will

2 Att

0 Def

1 Htp

Ranged.

Rest of his ability isnt 100 percent spoiled but pretty sure it says discard him unless you're engaged with an enemy.

Leadership one is Valiant sword.

Attach to Noble hero. Gains +1 att(2 if threat is 40 or higher).

I believe it's "you cannot play northern bowmaster from your hand unless you are engaged with an enemy."

I take it that Tactics Beorn is excluded from this "player card effect" sadly.😥

Beorn isn't immune while he's out of play, so you should be able to swap into him, though at 12 threat not a lot of heroes can swap into him.

I think I'm going to house rule that MotK threat raise counts as the threat for one of those heroes for this card, because the idea of running MotK Beorn, invoking his +5 attack, then swapping into his bear form (hero card) before he goes away would be so fantastic thematically.  Especially if you can do it during Battle of Five Armies.

With help from a few community members from Europe, we got a full set of player cards to discuss and I share my first thoughts on the quest by looking at the encounter cards. I have compiled my thoughts in this article, which will hopefully entertain you all enough while you are staying inside for the weekend: https://visionofthepalantir.com/2020/04/04/first-impressions-under-the-ash-mountains/ [https://visionofthepalantir.com/2020/04/04/first-impressions-under-the-ash-mountains/]

Not that I know of at this moment. Local shops are now selling the pack here since today. I'm not sure when US, UK, or Canadian shops will start selling them. Keep refreshing their inventory online. If it turns out to take very long, I might be able to ship some copies overseas, but that would only be for those that are impatient enough.

By the way with the cutting down your decks to 40 cards, discarding card at the end of each round, no shuffling cards from the discard pile and the ticking clock of losing as soon as your deck is empty this quest seems quite brutal, especially for decks with powerful draw engines (Erestor, Cirdan, some hobbit decks)

Having played the quest several times today and not getting past stage 1 in any of them does confirm this. The quest has you discard cards really quickly. It also starts you off with one of 4 nasty side-quests, and a tough enemy that limits your progress per round to 5. You need to go to the side-quests to lower the number of cards you discard at the end of each round, but that does also mean you lose rounds of progress that could have gone on the main quest. 
Not to mention the other deadly enemies in this quest. The Patrol that starts in play has Hill-Troll level stats, but has a higher defence and will make 2 attacks against you in the round you engage it. There are 2 copies and a location that fetches them when it is explored (as they don't go to the VD). With side-quests forcing you to travel and limiting damage on enemies to 4 per round, it feels very unfair to solo players, as there is no chance to get through the quest fast enough while discarding cards and having to fight off these big enemies (Trolls, Nameless Things, Werewolves, etc). 
It's a very brutal quest, but I would imagine it to be easier in higher player counts, as one player can engage the patrol and the rest can quest hard to get through the 25 quest points on each quest card before the decks dry up.

During setup it has you discard cards from your deck until you're down to 40. Then it prevents you from using events to shuffle cards in your discard pile back into your deck.

If anyone hasn't tried it yet, I would recommend (since I don't have the pack yet) to play dwarves against this. They get benefits from underground locations ( hello Bombur) but also can make great use of an attachment that kinda sucked until now.

Dwarf Pipe

Well Dwarf Pipe was still quite useful in a dedicated mining deck, but I agree it can be (apparently for now) a bit of a silver bullet against this quest.

It will at least slow down the rate at which you discard cards from your deck by putting them on the bottom. Cycling Galadhrim Weaver will help as well, though it won't stop you from losing all your cards before long. The chance of hitting all three of your pipes before any get discarded are slim, though ally Bilbo can help a little. However, the resources spent to get this up and running won't be spent to counter the big enemies in this quest, so you might die that way. Like I said, the quest is very tricky and I will encourage multiplayer just to divide the tasks a little better. I will also be looking forward to trying this with my mono-Lore deck and cycling The Great Hunt to get rid of the Patrol that way. Though mono-Lore will have to do without a ton of card draw, as will only further complicate things down the line. 

I will admit that adding the Ered Luin Miner and Hidden Cache to your deck for this quest will get you some good results. Might even be worth including on top of your standard deck, just to hope to discard them for setup.

Then you must really not like this last cycle, or a good chunk of quests in this game for that matter.

I think the problem is theres no way to make everyone happy. If one deck could beat every encounter easily the people who play often would get bored. 

I do agree that its a disheartening feeling when playing a block of content sequentially to have a deck your excited to play, only for the encounter you set unto have X invalidate Y and ruin your decks performance- Such as testing a trap deck and being against the Hurons who cant have attachments. 

I think the ideal is for an encounter to have a chance of being beaten by most decent decks, or require a few minor card swaps- But I am glad that unique deck building quests exist as well as insane challenge quests.

I can understand both sides of this debate as I have certain heroes that I like to play and it's disheartening to think against certain quests they are almost unplayable. However, I see the other side that if every group of heroes and every sphere could beat every quest then it would just be a matter of deciphering how to play certain combinations of cards and there wouldn't really be a need for different spheres except for flavor.

One solution for this that I've seen is the Book of Elessar series of playthroughs on YouTube in which he plays through all the quests using Aragorn but changes the other heroes and the deck based on the quest. I could see this working with almost any hero so that's one possible workaround to this problem.

The narrower the possible builds that can be effective against a quest, the less replayablity a quest will have.  I don't think it's a problem when a quest *can* be beaten by every solo-capable archtype, because the experience of play will be different and the winning percentages may vary widely between different deck types.  Most non-nightmare quests fit this description, IMO.

A quest that can be beaten by a wide variety of archtypes, but ONLY if they sideboard in a card particularly essential for that quest also damages replayability, because searching for the essential card(s) overshadows the natural differences in deckplay.  Shadow cancellation in Road to Rivendell would be the classic example of this problem.

A quest that's so easy that any deck will reliably beat it serves as a good preview for playing Marvel Champions.

Quite right, coming from an LotR LCG perspective I was surprised at how easy Marvel Champions is. Even the harder scenarios (Ultron, Mutagen Formula) are what would be considered moderate-easy in LotR.
