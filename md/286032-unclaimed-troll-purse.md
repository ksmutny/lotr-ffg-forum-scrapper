In playing the first scenario of the Hobbit boxes, if one draws a Troll Purse in the staging area, but all three trolls are already engaged, does the player have to allow a troll to return to the staging area, or can Bilbo just pay a resource to claim it. It would seem to be the latter, but I wanted to make sure that I was reading it correctly regarding the "response" requirement.

Response: After attached Troll enemy is destroyed, the first player may spend 1 Baggins resource to claim this objective and attach it to Bilbo Baggins.

It doesn't matter if the trolls are engaged or not -- if there's an unattached Troll Purse in staging and a troll in play, the purse gets attached to a troll.

If all trolls are in the victory display, then Bilbo just pats a resource and it's attached to him?

All trolls are in the victory display look like a fulfill condition to victory, so nothing can happen after that.

If all the trolls are in the victory display then you would have immediately advanced to Stage 3 winning the game. If you want to use the Troll Purse effect you have to find it before killing all the trolls. It's not so easy to recover the treasures on this quest, mainly up to encounter deck luck (or lack of it).

Thanks to all for the clarification......this is tricky if one wants the treasures of the cave, but why play it out if not for those goodies. I'll give it another go.
