The Mrs. and I will be in Spain during Christmas time (Madrid, Barcelona, and Granada) and I would like to continue my tradition of meeting international players while I'm traveling. Please reply here or in a direct message if you would like to meet up in or around these cities over the holidays.

Regards,
Beorn

Hi Beorn ! I'm from Spain, I live quite near to Barcelona (about an hour and a half away from it), but if we don't have any compromises, me and my girlfriend will be happy to go to Barcelona to meet you and play some games with you. Also, I'm quite sure that some other players would be interested. There's a zone in Barcelona with a few specialized stores, and some of them have rooms enabled for playing board games.  Anyway, if you and your family, by any chance, get closer to Figueres (where the Dali Museum is), let me know it, this is the town where I live !

In fact, every year, when we are getting closer to the Spanish LOTR LCG players gathering, some players of the zone use to meet there a few weeks before, to test our decks for the gathering. I'm quite sure your visit will be an equally interesting incentive to gather those same players !!

We'll be waiting for your response !!

Hello Beorn!

I am from Spain too. My family and I live in Mallorca, but for Christmas we are going to Granada to visit the family. My english is very bad, but for me will be a pleasure if we can meet and talk.

I wait for the response and check the dates for your trip in Granada.

 

Thanks!

Hello!

We are in Granada from 25th Dec to 5th Jan. It will be a pleasure for me if we can met. There is only a day that we coincide. We are in Villanueva Mesía, a little town near city Granada. Here [https://www.google.com/maps/place/Villanueva+Mes%C3%ADa,+Granada/@37.2151472,-4.0149405,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0xd720a6c2e58005b:0x294cf30020a42b29!8m2!3d37.214584!4d-4.0112611]. We can move to any location near Granada in 26th December. We arrive to Granada airport late at nigth the 25th.

Muchas gracias, y será un placer conocernos si al final podemos quedar.

 

Saludos

Ok, I subscribed to this threat supposing that I would be notified by e-mail if there were any responses to that... it looks like FFG doesn't want to notify me... - _ - ''''

That sounds great Beorn ! 26th is also a public holiday in some regions of Spain, and Catalonia (where Barcelona is) is one of them, and most of the families here have family reunions. I think that 28th would be perfect as it is not a labour day, and some of us, which don't live in Barcelona, could be easily there. If you are looking for maps of Barcelona, there's a zone very close to the Subway station of "Arc de Triomf", which is full of boardgame stores, some of them with bar, and playing zones.

As it happens to Dieter, I'm not quite good at speaking in English, but anyway it will be a great pleasure to meet you! Your blog is my reference page for this game, I've spent lots of hours reading you, and trying your decks!!! (I think that I left some comments there, a few years ago...)
