Has there really been much information on how this game is/has been developed/designed? In other words, is an entire cycle's set of cards designed at once and then "simply" split up between the 6 Adventure Packs? How far ahead do they design? I would assume the Mirkwood Cycle was designed in conjunction with the Core Set but how far ahead do they go?

I would love to see articles from FFG not only spoiling cards but giving us insight into their design process and how they plan for the future of the game.
