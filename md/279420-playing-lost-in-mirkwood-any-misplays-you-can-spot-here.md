Staging area had Twilight Hall (no resources) 2 threat. Active location is a gentle Old Forest Road.

Questing for about 16 to look for a way out of here.

The way is clear for a cheeky Necklace of Girion to be played.

Then all **** breaks loose.

Revealed Abandoned Village (Objective Location), goes to staging area. Correct?

Then draw Twilight Hall to guard the necklace.

Reveal Overgrown Path (Objective Location) to guard Abondoned Village, goes to staging area.

Reveal Forest Gate to guard Abondoned Village.

Reveal Bare Hilltop (Objective Location) to guard the Overgrown Path, goes to staging area.

Reveal Dark Black Woods to guard the Overgrown Path.

Reveal Mirkwood Patrol to guard the Bare Hilltop.

 

2 threat in staging area, play Necklace of Girion. 13 threat in staging area when finished. Have I messed up and should I carry on?

So.. I think when you play a Guarded card, you discard cards until you find one that can attach to your guarded card.

You discarded an objective location.  It can't be attached to the necklace.  Didn't we have a ruling that stated objective-locations can't be attached as guards? -- also, Searching for a Way Out renders it immune to player card effects, so it can't be attached to a player card).

Because it can't be attached, you discard past it. It doesn't go to the staging area.

Next, you would have discarded Twilight Hall, which guards your necklace.  Now you're done.

Note that Guarded (X) works different from the Guarded keyword in the core set.  In the core set, you reveal the next card.  With Guarded (X), you discard until you find a matching card type, then attach.
