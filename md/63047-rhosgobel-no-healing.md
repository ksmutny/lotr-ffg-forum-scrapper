Text on the Rhosgobel location: "While Rhosgobel is in t he staging area, Wilyador cannot be healing."

This applies to card 3B, yes?  In short, meaning that if you have not removed Rhosgobel from the staging area, you cannot win.

 That's correct - so you had better to travel to Rhosgobel as soon as possible to avoid that outcome.
