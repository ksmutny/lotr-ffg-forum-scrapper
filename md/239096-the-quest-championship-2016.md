Thank you to Thanatopsis for hosting another great Hero Championship this year! I enjoyed participating and watching the results come in.

 

In the past years we've often followed it with other championships, and this year I wanted to start one myself.

 

Here is the 2016 Quest Championship!

 

It will work differently than the Hero Championship, because I've decided to make the first round a Swiss-style Tournament.

 

There will be 7 rounds of matchups, where you will vote on 43 pairings of the 86 quests. There will be no elimination throughout the 7 rounds, so you will always have 43 matches to vote on. The nice thing about this is that after it's done, we should have a complete ranking of the all the quests in the game.

 

After the Swiss tournament, I will take the top 16 quests and we will have an elimination-style tournament to crown the ultimate quest of 2016!

 

Check out http://challonge.com/lotrquest2016 [http://challonge.com/lotrquest2016] to vote!

 

Top 16: http://challonge.com/lotrquest2016top16 [http://challonge.com/lotrquest2016top16]

 

 

Note: You are not required to vote in every matchup. If a matchup contains a quest you've never played, you can abstain from voting on it if you wish.

 

The Swiss rounds will be quick, with only 2 days for each round:

Rounds will end at Noon EST (UTC-5) on the following dates:

Round 1: Jan 10

Round 2: Jan 12

Round 3: Jan 14

Round 4: Jan 16

Round 5: Jan 18

Round 6: Jan 20

Round 7: Jan 22

 

The Elimination rounds will be longer, with 3 days for each round:

Rounds will end at Noon EST (UTC-5) on the following dates:

Top 16: Jan 25

Top 8: Jan 28

Top 4: Jan 31

Finals: Feb 3

 

Enjoy, and thanks for voting!

Great idea! I've been eager to find how some of the newer quests have been perceived by the community.

Nice! (hopefully it will give me a little more time to better prepare the art-appreciation contest :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] )

 

It's hard to vote when there are a lot of quests I've never played :X btw, imo people shouldn't vote on matchups that include quests they've never played; I've done so and I left some brackets with no vote. In other words, voting for quest A over quest B because "I have played quest A and never played quest B" shouldn't be a valid reason (personal opinion)

Now, some comments on matchups:

 

Foundations of Stone vs Dungeons Deep and Caverns Dim

I hate both. Foundations is slightly less obnoxious.

 

Into Ithilien vs Battle of Five Armies // The Siege of Cair Andros vs A Shadow of the Past

I love all these four quests. At the end my votes were because I enjoy the higher difficulty level.

 

The Watcher in the Water vs We Must Away Ere Break of Day

This was the toughest matchup this round. I find both of them pretty average quests. I guess I'd rather go with the hobbits' saga quest because it's more enjoyable when I aim at both completing the quest and getting the treasures.

 

EDIT: My voting this round (I didn't vote on matchups that include at least one quest that I've never played) 

Passage Through Mirkwood vs The Battle of Carn Dûm

The Watcher in the Water vs We Must Away Ere Break of Day

The Long Dark vs Over the Misty Mountains Grim

Foundations of Stone vs Dungeons Deep and Caverns Dim

Shadow and Flame vs Flies and Spiders

Peril in Pelargir vs The Lonely Mountain

Into Ithilien vs The Battle of Five Armies

The Siege of Cair Andros vs A Shadow of the Past

The Steward's Fear vs A Knife in the Dark

The Drúadan Forest vs Flight to the Ford

Encounter at Amon Dîn vs The Ring Goes South

Assault on Osgiliath vs Journey in the Dark

The Blood of Gondor vs Breaking of the Fellowship

The Fords of Isen vs Helm's Deep

Intruders in Chetwood vs The Battle of Lake-town

The Weather Hills vs The Stone of Erech

Deadman's Dike vs The Old Forest

The Wastes of Eriador vs Fog on the Barrow-downs

Oh man, Dungeons Dim is going to get thrashed by Foundations of Stone this round.  Rightly so I guess, but Dungeons Dim is one of my top 5, although many people seem to hate it.  Foundations is a fan favorite, so I'm sorry to see such an uneven matchup for the riddling contest.  

 

The only really hard choice for me was Wastes of Eriador vs Fog on the Barrow-Downs.  Both very unique quests, super thematic, and some of my favorites.  I ended up going with Fog.

I feel bad for Across the Ettenmoors. I liked the quest, although I voted for Murder at the Prancing Pony. So did 100% of other people it seems. Ouch.

Really love this idea Seastan, a few years ago I did an extremely half assed version of this so it will be very interesting to see the results of a proper quest championship and if similar quests end up at the top.

I remeber there was a similiar contest last year from that I would say:

TOP 3:

Helm's Deep (best)

Massing at Osgiliath

Battle of the Pelennor

BOTTOM 3:

Dead Marshes (worst)

Nin-in-Eilph

Rhosgobel

 

Interessting matchups for me:

 

Stormcaller > Rhosgobel - I hate both, Rhosgobel for ist randomness and forcing you to get some key Cards and Stormcaller for it's timepressure (I just can't enjoy the game when I am forced to hurry), but Stormcaller is objectivly the better quest (design, Story, replayablility)

 

Knife in the dark > Stewad's fear - Both great. Replayability is on Steward's side. But Knife is one of my most played quests and covers one of my favorite parts of the books. I have to choose it. And the Showdown on weather top is always epic.

 

Morgul Vale > Uruk Hai - Vale is quite unique in it's Progress style and uruk hai isn't all thatspecial and again enforces a quick game :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

 

Laketown > Chetwood - For me Laketown is THE boss battle quest. Still today Smaug is a fearsome enemie. Chetwood on the other Hand is enjoyable but a Little generic.

 

Ettenmoors > Pony - Don't like either one, but Ettenmoors has it's Moments. Since I spent 1 hour with Pony revealing no new clue (or did I read the rules wrong?) ultimatly giving up, guessing and going lucky, the ques is dead for me, despite it's insane replayability.

 

Escape from Dol Guldur > Voyage across belegaer - Escape is a nice challenge (rip solo Players :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]). Belegaer is way to easy in my opinion.

 

Siege of Gondor > Nin-in-Eilph - Again I hate both. Nalir is such a terrible objectiv "ally" he really ruins your mood. Siege gets my vote because the probem I have with it is solved in multiplayer: Solo I just don't get enough ships. I just don't understand why I should except the extra Counters for the pellenor quest when I could beat the quest easily revealling as much encountercards as possible and getting not enough ships in time. Plus the amout of shuffling you have to do during this quest is annoying too :angry: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_angry.png] 

 

Deadmen's Dike > Old Forest - Closer matchup but Dike has a great theme and enemie and, while forest nails the "lost Feeling" of the old forrest, it Fails to amaze with one evil root after the other.

 

Into Ithilien > Five armies - While 5 armies is still the "best" Hobbit quest, Into Ithilien is a classic and quite enjoyable (retrospective; god was this quest frustrating when I first played it :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png])

 

Wastes of Eriador > Fog on the Barrow Downs - Wastes is a nice "Marathon" style quest. Fog also in that much of a sprint but it has more "unfair" effects, what isn't quite what I love :

Did not have to think about many match-ups for long, but:

 

Celebrimbor's Secret > Nin-in-Eilph - I don't like any of these (goes for much of the Isengart-quests), but in the end Nalir makes the difference :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

Morgul Vale > Ring goes south - I like both and played them all very often. Objectivly looking (or trying) Valeis much more unique and I would say challenging so it gets the vote.

Yeah, Nalir is literally the worst character in the game. I even liked Lord Alcaron more.

I find myself voting against any quest that has a lot of siege or battle.

That one doesn't bother me as much because at least you have the option to do the non-battle/siege quest.

I find it so interesting that people hate The Nin-in-Eilph so much.  I've always thought it was one of the better quests.

## 24 [Seastan on January 11, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/239096-the-quest-championship-2016/?do=findComment&comment=2582922)

> I find it so interesting that people hate The Nin-in-Eilph so much.  I've always thought it was one of the better quests.

 

I'm not surprised at all. It's got quest stages that wipe your progress every couple rounds. That's a recipe for hatred, with Nalir as the cherry on top.

I think quests that focus only on the elements, like Nin-in-Eilph or the Old Forest, will score pretty low. If there's only 5 Enemies in a 40-card encounter deck, people are only going to get bored or location-locked. Those quests, while thematic, aren't a good experience.

I think they are fun.  Mindlessly slaying orcs is fun on occasion, but that also gets boring and is usually pretty easy to deal with.  There are only so many location quests which are a nice change of pace.  The real reason I like The Nin-in-Eilph is because of the quest stage variability, though.  Making a deck that is consistently good against it when you don't know what the first quest stage will be is a different kind of challenge, especially since 2/3 of the stage 2s are particularly punishing.

Shadow and Flame vs The Battle of Five Armies

Shadow and Flame is one of my favorite 'boss' quests, but TBOFA is super solid all-around, well balanced in all aspects.

 

The Three Trials vs Journey in the Dark

I've managed to complete JitD without even making the Balrog appear. In TTT it's impossible to avoid the bosses, and I'd rather prefer this; a healthy-difficult quest right from the go.

 

Intruders in Chetwood vs Helm's Deep

Helm's Deep is super innovative and all that, but Intruders in Chetwood has a charming simplicity that makes it one of my favorite quests to replay and test decks.

 

A Journey to Rhosgobel vs Escape from Mount Gram

I love both. Yeah I'm one of those people who actually like AJtR. A good scrying deck works well against this quest, and that's why I like it, because I think it gives emphasis to one of the most ignored aspects when deck-building: scrying.

 

Into Ithilien vs Flies and Spiders

This was a no-brainer. Into Ithilien is (maybe) my all-time favorite quest, meanwhile I dislike with a passion quests that have in-built mechanics (venom in this case) that make you discard cards (either from your hand or from your deck)

I would agree with every part of this statement - not only is Into Ithilien an awesome quest (though immensely frustrating at the time it was released), but quests that screw with your basic economy (cards & resources) are exceptionally annoying.

Dungeons Deep and Caverns Dim vs The Dead Marshes

I've realized and arrived to the conclusion that DDaCD is the quest I like the least amongst all quests I've ever played... the riddle mechanic is disgusting.

 

Helm's Deep vs Journey in the Dark

Helm's Deep is good, yet overrated. Too many locations for my taste I guess.

 

Flight to the Ford vs Escape from Dol Guldur

For some reason this was the hardest choice for me this round... FttF is pretty good, but EfDG has that maniac-addictive difficulty level that makes you want to play it over and over again, despite failing over 95% of the time...

How are you determining the matchups in the Swiss rounds? Are they predetermined or affected by previous rounds? I'd hate to see Helm's Deep absolutely clobber all 7 opponents simply on the basis of being assigned far weaker quests to challenge.

The matchups are determined automatically by the website based on number of wins. You'll see right now that Helm's Deep is matched up against Journey in the Dark, another quest with a 3-0 record.

 

Also, the Swiss is just the first stage of the tournament to determine the top 16. Then it will become a traditional single-elimination tournament with the Swiss rankings determining the seeding.

I suppose I can understand why people like Murder at the Prancing Pony because of the theme right?  I was actually pretty disappointed with this quest.  When it was being previewed the developers kept saying they wanted to create a scenario that was going to have variety and to do that they created the different suspects and hideouts.  However, after playing it more than a few times, it actually feels so similar every time I play it.  The main reason for this is because the beginning is no different, and in my opinion, it is the main threat that the scenario throws at you.  Once you've gotten past the beginning, the bosses and hideouts don't seem to change the difficulty much even if some are slightly more challenging to deal with.  I guess my expectations were too high for this quest, but I personally feel the quest fell flat at performing its intended objective of providing variety so perhaps I judge it too harshly.

I cant help but be a little sad seeing the Mirkwood quests getting destroyed. I had such good times with those quests years ago (still do) and they have a lot of good memories in them, after all it was the first fresh new content after the core which was incredibly exciting at the time.

I'm not a big fan of Prancing Pony either. I've only played it once admittedly so don't have much experience but yeah its not anywhere near as good as other POD quests and I think its highly overrated as well, everyone seems to absolutely love it. 

I have voted against Prancing Pony in every matchup so far I'm pretty sure  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

I've voted for Return to Mirkwood, Conflict and Passage during a few rounds and have voted for Journey Along the Anduin every round thus far, are they really getting that crushed? (I know some of these are core and not mirkwood) I need to have another look at the results and rankings thus far. 

I have to admit that quests like Rhosgobel, Dead Marshes and Hunt for Gollum deserve to be at the bottom though, compared to everything else we now have they are extremely boring and subpar.

I completely forgot about The Treachery of Rhudaur until this competition put it back on the map for me. We must have beat it on our first try and then never pulled it back out of the box, because I really don't remember it at all. (I blame getting kicked in the head by Carn Dum around the same time). I'll have to go back and try it again to see what all the fuss is about.

 

It looks really fun, actually.

That's a fair point. I've been voting for Murder at the Prancing Pony most of the way here, but I have actually only played it a few times. (To be fair, most quests only get played a few times, so that's not really a knock against it).

 

I'll have to go back and play it again and see if it's still as good as I remember it being.

 

Looking over the results so far, it looks like the top quests kind of fall into one of two categories:

1) Quests with elements that make each play a little different, like branching quest paths or randomly selected boss enemies

2) Epic battles from the books

 

It'll be interesting to see if that trend continues.

For discussion: based on the ranking so far, what is the most surprising result to you?

 

I guess I am surprised to see Into Ithilien up at 16. Although I really like that quest, I thought it was despised for its difficulty. I guess it has aged well in the growing card pool.

A Journey to Rhosgobel. I knew it was a polarizing quest, but I still expected some victories...

I played Into Ithilian right at its release, and I never understood the fuss. It seemed like a 4 difficulty to me. Same with Cair Andros. All you needed was a Tactics, leadership deck to quest the battle and seige, and then fight. I got 11 wins straight in Cair Andros before I just stopped, and Into Ithilian wasnt much harder. What difficulties were you guys facing?

Apart from the before mentioned win from the dead marshes, it is the 70th place for battle of lake-town. It is so unique in that you really only have ONE enemy and a very nice challenge.

Playing one-handed with Leadership/Lore (LeAragorn/Theodred/Denethor) or Spirit/Tactics (Eowyn/Thalin/Gimli).  Good combat decks can do well against Into Ithilien, if Celador dies there's never a need for willpower questing.  But that also means that decks designed to generate willpower questing will find the quest difficult.  Is the proper measure of difficulty how tough a quest is for a purpose-built deck, or how tough it is for a general-purpose deck.  I hold with the latter.

Well yeah, but I think most General-all purpose decks were attack/tactics leadership in Heirs. By stating in the rules the battle and siege, I think the quests were designed to be played against using much more attack focused decks.. but yeah who knows

I find it interesting that among quests with 1 or 0 losses, we have representatives from every complete cycle except for Ringmaker, 1 Hobbit box, and 4 of the 5 LotR boxes as well as several PODs.  Good quests can be found anywhere.

 

I'm a little surprised by the poor performance of Ringmaker quests.  I thought it was a good cycle, but I guess a lot of people got turned off by the abundance of time counters.  Fords of Isen is one of my top 5 quests.

 

I'm also surprised by the strong performance of Into Ithilien and Siege of Cair Andros.  To me, they fall into the personally-despised group of quests that require quest-specific deck building.  I thought that was the same complaint against Journey to Rhosgobel, so I'm surprised to see JtR go 0-5 while the battle/siege quests are doing well.

 

The LotR saga quests are (not surprisingly) doing quite well.  However, I rarely see people playing those quests.  I think the whole campaign aspect makes them less appealing to pickup and play.

But we're talking shadow effects, not treacheries.  An untimely Undisturbed Bones shadow effect means dead ally + dead hero = probably gg.

There is also Southron Support which is basically Surge 4, and if it happens on the first quest phase it's pretty punishing.

I'm a bit surprised we've had as many ties as we have, I would've thought that'd be pretty rare with the number of people voting.

There's an average of about 30 votes per matchup. That leaves only 30 possible scores for a match, and there are 43 matches. So it's not surprising that we get several ties, given the the Swiss algorithm is biased to put evenly ranked quests against each other.

Throughout the championship so far, I've had considerably more hard choices between two quests that I hate than I have ones between two quests that I really love. I guess that suggests that maybe I'm mostly in agreement with the community on the really bad quests, but we diverge on absolute top favourites? Alternatively I find it easier to judge "I like both of these but this one more" than "I hate both of these and don't want to vote for either."

Helm's Deep vs Breaking of the Fellowship

The fun-level factor is similar in both quests. At the end I'm going with the more innovative mechanic.

 

Foundations of Stone vs Wastes of Eriador

Not a fan of any of these. In FoS I dislike the part where the quest "reset", and Wastes of Eriador feels like there is no way to make the quest shorter. In the end I hate Wastes of Eriador less.

 

My votes:

Helm's Deep vs Breaking of the Fellowship

The Battle of the Pelennor Fields vs Journey Along the Anduin (haven't played TBotPF)

Foundations of Stone vs Wastes of Eriador

The Ruins of Belegost vs The Seventh Level (haven't played TRoB)

Journey in the Dark vs Conflict at the Carrock

Murder at the Prancing Pony vs Flight of the Stormcaller (haven't played neither)

The Steward's Fear vs The Treachery of Rhudaur

A Knife in the Dark vs The Battle of Five Armies

 

I'm sad Into Ithilien and The Siege of Cair Andros didn't make the cut... Also sad about The Battle of Carn Dûm and Return to Mirkwood

Aaand Journey to Rhosgobel got 85th place out of 86!  :blink: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_blink.png] I'm guessing I'm the only person in these forums who enjoy this quest

Helm's Deep vs Breaking of the Fellowship - I'm a sucker for separate staging areas, and breaking of the fellowship does it the best.  Helm's Deep is epic, but it can be a real slog, especially 3-4 player, and I find myself totally exhausted after playing it.

 

The Battle of the Pelennor Fields vs Journey Along the Anduin - I'm glad Anduin made it to the cut, because it is a classic that has stood the test of time.  But I almost never play it these days.

 

Foundations of Stone vs Wastes of Eriador - I normally play 3-4 player, so Foundations of Stone gets the pick here (separate staging areas FTW!).  1 or 2 player I would pick Wastes.

 

Ruins of Belegost vs Seventh Level - Seventh Level is such a great, simple quest and my favorite of the cycle.  Ruins of Belegost is cool, but I've never come close to beating it.  

 

Journey in the Dark vs Conflict at the Carrock - I'm a little surprised Carrock made the cut.  Journey in the Dark is amazing though.  It captures the sense of doom perfectly.  I'm predicting it wins the tournament.

 

Murder at the Prancing Pony vs Flight of the Stormcaller - Tough choice.  Stormcaller is a great quest.  But Johnny Goblin-Fingers...

 

Steward's Fear vs Treachery of Rhudaur - Steward's Fear is fun, but can be quite nasty at 3-4 players with location lock.  Treachery is one of my go-to quests for deck testing and has a great tempo.

 

A Knife in the Dark vs Battle of Five Armies - I might be underrating Battle of the Five Armies because I rarely play any hobbit quests.  Meanwhile, Black Riders might be my favorite box in the game for quests.

QUEST MATCHUP SPOTLIGHT!

 

Foundations of Stone versus Wastes of Eriador!

 

Since quests cannot speak, we had to track down some appropriate mascots.  The quests had this to say for themselves:

I think it's funny that dead marshes ahs by far the worst point difference and is far from being last xD. Also never thought about the long dark as the "worst" quest, as it is ofc forgetable, but not that terrible.

 

For the best of 16:

Helms' Deep > Breaking of the fellowship - Helm's Deep will win. It completly smashed any opponent during the first 7 rounds with the "closest" matchup being against battle of the pellenor at 63-38. And that is totally fine. The quest is unique, thematic and nails the difficulty without being frustrating or bringing too annoying Encounter Cards.

 

Murder at the prancing Pony > Flight of the stormcaller - I write this every time, but I still hate flight of the stormcaller.

 

Battle of the Pellenor fields > Journey along the Anduin - Anduin surely is the best aged quest, but it just isn't on par with todays top quests.

 

Ruins of Belegost > The 7th Level - Replayability, a dragon and challenge easily take out the slaughter feast.

 

Journey in the dark > Conflict at the Carrock - Carrock is one of the better mirkwood quests, but time took much of it's difficulty. Journey is still awesome in the theme and can be very dramatic if don't manage to outrun the timer :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

Wastes of Eriador > Foundations of Stone - I like Wastes for being a very Long quest. You can "rush" through so many quests if your deck/draws are good, it's nice to have a quest that Forces the Long game on you.

 

Steward's fear > Treachery of Rhudauer - Feat is the better quest in my book as it doesn't have an obvious game plan like rhudauer (turtling).

 

Knife in the dark > battel of the five armies - This is just because of the theme. I love the Feeling of knife in the dark.

There are a lot of quests here that I haven't played - in particular, the print on demand ones and several of the campaign quests. I played 'Knife in the Dark' so long ago that I don't remember it at all, and haven't played the campaign past the hobbit saga box. This makes for a total of 7/16 quests that I have no opinion on, and given how the votes appear to be going, next round I will likely only recognize 3/8 quests.

 

This tells me I need to play the campaign and order these print on demand quests, which apparently are quite good. I found the campaign very confining and fiddly initially - hopefully returning to it will leave a more favorable impression.

I'm curious what you mean by this comment.  In Rhudaur you get 5 turns to get ready and get a clue, then Thaudir is coming for you whether you like it or not.  If you didn't get a clue, then get ready for undefended attacks and +3 attack shadow cards.  I don't see how turtling is a good strategy for this quest.

Although I like the quest, I do turtle for Rhudaur because I often stretch myself too thin if I try for an objective. I find it better to just equalize questing, and clear out what's already in play so that when Thaurdir comes out I'm ready for him. Though in multiplayer, where you can have a dedicated questing deck, it's totally viable to go for an objective.

Really loving how this championship is going, thanks again for running it Seastan. It is exciting that we are now up to elimination rounds and the swiss rounds are over (as great as they were). Here are my votes for this first round of elimination:

Helm's Deep vs Breaking of the Fellowship - I'm going to cast a vote that shocks even me for the first match up!!! I think Helm's Deep is such a great quest and that the developers did such a perfect job with it (mechanics AND difficulty) that I am disappointed I am not voting for it once all is said and done. Yes it is amazing but is it the best quest in the game? Yeah probably not, its a little bit too challenging/frustrating (as it should be though) and maybe even a little too grand or epic. Breaking of the Fellowship also has amazing mechanics and is an extremely unique and well designed quest. My one pet hate for this quest is missing out on The Seat of Seeing though and I usually have to replay the quest a few times before I am lucky enough to see it appear (and not be discarded from quest effects). I love the four quest stages you get to choose from at the end (that all have beneficial effects for players) and I love that other players get to stay at these stages until the end while the first player tries to escape with Frodo. Someone else said it above and I couldn't agree more; this quest is definitely the best of the quests that split staging areas up or force players to split up. I really love that you can still use Ranged and Sentinel (not being able to use these in Fog on the Barrow Downs and Foundations kind of sucks as much as it makes perfect thematic sense) on top of the quest stage effects you can use to buff team mates. Even the way the encounter cards and quest itself deal with this is really cool featuring various effects that can move locations or enemies between the various staging areas while they hunt for the Hobbits and attempt to take them captive. Half just to mix things up and half because I think Helm's Deep is just a bit too epic or grand to win the championship I'm voting for Breaking of the Fellowship . It is a fantastic and iconic quest just like Helm's Deep but is a little more forgiving, interesting and has to be one of the best quests in the game as far as multiplayer (as opposed to solo) or multiple staging areas are concerned. 
 
The Battle of the Pelennor Fields vs Journey Along the Anduin - Here goes another crazy vote! First off Pelennor Fields is amazing, in fact I think I like it more than Helm's Deep which is really saying something. It is one of the most epic quests we have so far and beating it is immensely satisfying and fun. It also represents yet another truly iconic moment in Lord of the Rings. There are a few minor issues I believe though such as the mechanic with the escaping/trapped allies (if you get all allies with 1 hitpoint this part of the quest often doesn't really function properly). Minor issues such as these combined with the fact that Journey Along the Anduin STILL remains relevant today even though it is from the core set of the game is what cemented my vote. Think about the core set. We get Passage which is utterly unplayable with todays card pool (unless you enjoy winning in three rounds without any chance of ever losing) if you don't play the Nightmare version and Escape from Dol Guldur which is more of a niche quest that also doesn't have much replayability and is more of a specific challenge than anything else. Then we have Journey which is highly replayable (and variable!), has simple but extremely effective mechanics and is one of the main quests used by players to test decks out. This quest has legitimately stood the test of time and is still loved by the community. You cannot say the same for Passage or Escape (there will be plenty of people who love both but not the vast majority of the community like Journey) or really even most of the quests from the first cycle. Most of them are just too easy, too inconsistent or too simple mechanics wise compared to the quests we get now. Journey will forever remain relevant and honestly probably deserves to win this championship for that alone! 
 
Foundations of Stone vs Wastes of Eriador - I don't think either of these quests deserve a spot in the top 16 to be honest. I do really like both quests but they are certainly not among my favourites. Although I really like Foundations (especially the art on the Nightmare version) I'm going to have to go with Wastes of Eriador here. I have a love/hate relationship with Wastes as it is an amazing quest but is just so **** frustrating at times. Uncancellable shadow effects and treacheries every second turn is just ridiculous and the treachery card Nightfall is easily my most hated treachery in the entire game. Seeing multiple copies of it appear during a single game and it wreaking absolute havoc on you is not an unusual occurrence and can make you want to flip the table. As much as I am voting for it this particular round I would be disappointed if Wastes won the whole thing.
 
Ruins of Belegost vs Seventh Level - Now if it was Nightmare Seventh Level my vote would probably be different as NM Seventh Level is an AMAZING quest. The original is just too simple and basic for me to vote for it against what is easily my favourite of the POD/Special Event quests. Ruins of Belegost is just so **** amazing and feels like what certain quests in the past should have been like (I'm thinking a few quests in Dwarrowdelf). The only one issue is difficulty but I have beaten it a couple of times and although each time it was such a disgustingly long and intense game it is so **** satisfying getting a win agains this quest. People say it is too hard but I don't find it anywhere as difficult as quests like Nightmare Amon Din or Battle of Carn Dum. I also find that that hardest part is mid to late quest where you are trying to find your way to the final quest stage and can potentially be forced to clear several different copies of Stage 3 before you are able to advance. You have to reveal an encounter card per player when arriving at Stage 3A, C or E which on top of the Hazard mechanic and plenty of surge can easily overwhelm you. If I had to make a single change to this quest I would remove this additional revealing of extra encounter cards from the three copies of Stage 3 or would at least reduce it to a single card not one per player. That being said I like that this issue occurs late in a game so you have time to try and prepare yourself and are not getting your face smashed in within the first few rounds. If a quest is going to be hard and I am going to suffer a ton of losses before grinding out a win I'd much rather face those losses late game during the majority of matches rather than within the first few rounds. This way at least the losses are fun and I get somewhere rather than just having to constantly scoop, shuffle and restart. 
 
Journey in the Dark vs Conflict at the Carrock - Conflict at the Carrock although simple is surely a classic and that can be seen by how well it has done. That being said it does not compare to Journey in the Dark. Such a pivotal and important section of Lord of the Rings that this quest captures perfectly. It also has some truly breathtaking art (especially on locations) and is one of the most exciting quests in the game in my opinion as you are always watching that Balrog timer and trying to get as far as possible (or escaping altogether!) before it goes off.
 
Murder at the Prancing Pony vs Flight of the Stormcaller - The matchup I care least about. Only played Murder once and wasn't much of a fan at all and don't have any immediate plans to play it again. Flight of the Stormcaller wasn't something I was overly impressed by either and although the concept and mechanics are really cool this quest didn't captivate me like it did most users on the forums when it was released. Have to give this one to Flight of the Stormcaller just for how unique it is and how cool the concept of chasing the Stormcaller through the quest stages is, also alternative win conditions are always great. 
 
Steward's Fear vs Treachery of Rhudaur - If Treachery somehow beats Steward I would be incredibly shocked. Steward is one of the best quests in the game to me (minus the potential for location lock) and the Nightmare version is great as well. Don't get me wrong I like Treachery as well but it is not even close to a top tier quest for me whereas Steward most definitely is. Only thing about Steward is it isn't exactly an iconic quest as it doesn't exactly scream Lord of the Rings (no Orc or Ringwraith enemies or anything else iconic) with its detective/investigator feel (clue cards, plot cards etc). It is certainly more thematic and iconic than Murder at the Prancing pony though that's for sure.
 
A Knife in the Dark vs Battle of Five Armies - I love A Knife in the Dark but Battle of Five Armies is just so epic and whats more is the only decent quest from both Hobbit boxes! (I actually do like Over the Misty Mountains Grim as well but Battle is a better quest and is certainly more epic). Definitely a close one but in the end I have to vote for Battle of Five Armies. 

We have such an interesting bunch of quests remaining and although many amazing quests didn't make it I really like how eclectic our final 16 is. We have a few early quests that are still very playable and enjoyable even with todays card pool, two POD quests, a handful of the best saga quests and a couple of very unique and clever newer quests such as Wastes and Flight. I would be happy if any of the following end up winning the championship as they are all honestly classics: Helm's Deep, Pelennor Fields, Battle of Five Armies, Breaking of the Fellowship, Ruins of Belegost, Journey Along the Anduin or Journey in the Dark. I do feel like it should really be something that is either iconic or very thematic though, if Prancing Pony wins I'd be extremely dismayed...

I'm sad that my personal favorite (Temple of the Decieved) just barely missed the mark, coming in at 17! What a heartbreaker!

 

Even so, this is a great set of quests. I'm sort of ambivalent about A Knife in the Dark and The Seventh Level (both of which are fine quests but wouldn't make my personal top 16) but in general I seem to have pretty similar tastes to the rest of the forum-going community.

 

Interesting that the only complete cycle that's not represented in the top 16 is Voice of Isengard + Ringmaker -- whose most popular quest was The Three Trials at #43, which means that it didn't have a single quest in the top 50%.

First of I should say, that I usually Play solo or two Player and therefore vote/comment with this in mind. I/We found it to be the easiest way to fokus on one of the 3 quests and adjusting the decks to this choice (that is what I mean by turteling: Not even trying to do more than 1 quest and even if you don't make it, it shouldn't hurt to much).

As were max 2 Players mostly we usually choose the quest that gets Progress done when you kill enemies (we found you get the most Progress for your Troubles this way) and it is not to hard to handle about 1 enemy per round as long as the right deck has the highest threat. With one finished quest many shadow effects loose much power and as the decks are made to deal with enemies, so Thaurdir is not that bad.

Finishing a quest is easier the more Players you are, so when I Play solo I expect having to live without a clue, what isn't too bad as you can use the 5 turns to set up a burning brand and be fine, as long as you can handle about 2 attacks per round (Thaurdir + an enemy or sorcery).

 

In Steward's Fear Things can dramatically Change depending on what plot/enemy you get. On the one Hand this doesn't allow too specific deck Building and bringing an Allrounder might be better, on the other you aren't tempted to do the same again and again. That's why I go with fear. It surprises me way more often and forces to adapt the gameplan.

Even though I voted for wastes of eriador I am surprised it took out foundations of Stone :blink: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_blink.png] For the next round:

Helm's Deep > Battle of the pellenor fields - the two quests that are the most similiar to each other and I think Helm's Deep is a little better. It is just the Little easier set-up, the somehow a bit better atmosphere (also I don't know why pellenor doesn't feel quite so awesome) and (in my case) being annoyed that you didn't get enough ship Locations during siege of gondor to have one less time Counter :D.

On a side note: Somehow Helm's Deep seems to be the more memorable battle for most media (book's, movies, (Video)games). If someone compares big desperate battles their go to one is helm's deep, even though pellenor IS THE battle of the age (of Course this is just my conception, curious how others see this)

Wastes of Eriador > Ruins of Belegost - Honestly don't understand why I vote for it^^ Every Belegost playthrough is different, exploring ancient ruins is cool, not to mention fighting a Dragon and defenitly more challenging. It's just if I had to choose one of the quests right know I would choose Wastes, so I can't justify voting against it.

Journey in the dark > Murder at the prancing Pony - Journey is one of the best quests ever made. Only downside is after some games you know how to leave the mines before it gets really ugly :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] Murder annoys me more than i entertains after some rounds of "Investigation" (and getting the same clues again and again...)

Steward's Fear > Battle of the five armies - Steward is an all time favourite I never get bored of. I never really cared much about the Hobbit quests as most of them are "very Special" in an annoying way. That isn't really true for five armies as the mechanics fit and work very well and I feel I should give especially five armies another try, but for the time being Steward rules supreme.

Very surprised that Foundations lost to Wastes of Eriador.  Happy about that, because I like Wastes better, but I thought Foundations was pretty universally loved while Wastes had a lot of haters.

Helm's vs Pellenor: I vote Pellenor.  It's a good matchup.  I like the feel of Pellenor better, which advances in stages with distinctly different flavors and has some cool built-in events.

Wastes vs Belegost: I just didn't care for Belegost.  On the other hand, Wastes is the only wolf-theme quest in the game, how about that?  I dig the theme more.

Journey vs Murder: I chose Journey.  Murder is always a foregone solution (the answer is always Johnny Goblin-fingers at Bill Ferny's house).  Seriously though, Murder can kind of drag for me.  I like the sense of urgency in Journey.

Steward vs Battle: probably the hardest choice for me here, both probably in my top 5.  I chose Battle.  It's a very unique quest and I have some good memories of that one.  You can play it thematically with 4 players and stand a chance of winning (Dwarves x2, Silvan Elves, men+Beorn).

Looks like we made all the same choices for all the same reasons! Steward vs. Battle was indeed a tough one.

For Belegost, I don't mind the theme at all, but the main issue for me is that while I think they're both hard and fun, Wastes demands a powerful deck while Belegost demands a powerful and specific deck (healing, rushing). So I end up playing Wastes more if I want give my generic deck a challenge.

If any cycle was going to not have a quest in the top 16, it doesn't exactly surprise me that it's Ringmaker. That said, I love Three Trials and I'm incredibly disappointed it didn't do better. I thought more people agreed with me on that one.

Wordplay aside, one of the problems with Wastes is that it can drag on a bit - a problem I've never had with Belegost.

 

On the current round:

Helm's Deep < Battle of Pelennor Fields - Helm's Deep has some bits of odd design, particularly with regard to multiplayer scaling, and Pelennor is the more epic battle.

Wastes of Eriador < Ruins of Belegost - Partly covered this above. Also Wastes can be incredibly swingy and frustrating (especially at higher player counts) while Belegost I've always found fun even when I'm losing.

Journey in the Dark < Murder at the Prancing Pony - I love both, but Prancing Pony is more unique. I could really go either way here though.

Steward's Fear > Battle of Five Armies - While I can see its good points, I've never been so onboard with the general love of Five Armies. It's good, but I've never really viewed it as a standout, whereas Steward's Fear is an amazing quest and absolutely one of my favourites.

Well that was a perfect quarter-final in my opinion :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] 

Helm's Deep > Wastes of Eriador - Wastes made it far (coming from seed 13), but I think this will be a clear match-up. As many stated above, wastes by far isn't flawless and Helm's Deep is close to a perfect quest.

Journey in the dark > Steward's Fear - I found this very tuff to decide. In the end I am going with Journey, but if you ask we an other day it might be Steward. What pushed me to Journey in the end is the tighter atmosphere.

There we go:

Helm's Deep > Journey in the dark - Biggest downsside in my opinion for Journey is, that you can cheat the Balrock, because that will be all you ever do, at least in campaign. Doesn't Change that it is an awesome quest and fully deserves the 2nd spot (how really doubts Helm's Deep will win?)

Wastes of Eriador > Stewawrd's Fear - I like both. I go for Wastes, because it has the "Underdog-Bonus" (coming from seed 13).

Journey in the Dark because the tempo and anticipation in that quest are amazing.

Steward's Fear because ... I don't know.  First time that I voted against Wastes of Eriador in the elimination tournament.  Steward is somehow more memorable, although I like both quests very much.

Apparently people really like:

 * Recreating epic battles (Helm's Deep, Pelennor, Five Armies, to some extent Journey in the Dark)
 * Quests with variable setup/resolution (Steward's Fear, Prancing Pony, Belegost)
 * Multiple staging areas (Foundations of Stone, Breaking, to some extent Stormcaller)
 * Balanced quests that don't require specific deckbuilding (Eriador, Anduin, Seventh Level, Rhudaur, Carrock, Knife in the Dark)

Cool contest. Really great quests made it to the elimination part (only have a personal grudge against flight of the stormcaller). A Little sad there wasn't a reason to doubt that helm's deep will win, even though in some rounds is was closer than I would have expected after the swiss round.

Will be interesting to see, if this Championship becomes a yearly Event like the hero one, if FFG manages to outo themselves and knock Helm's deep of the throne. I wouldn't expect much changes in the ranking as quests are more Independent than heroes, who are highly dependant on other Player Cards (imagine Boromir without fire/blood or gondorian shield).

Thanks to Seastan for the organisation of this championship and one wish: can you make the same championship of unique allies? Thanks

## 97 [Seastan on February 4, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/239096-the-quest-championship-2016/?do=findComment&comment=2625541)

Given that the community seems to favour saga quests, it may be hard to topple Helm's Deep. Maybe something from The Mountain of Fire could do it, or it could just lose because people don't like to see the same quest win multiple times.

If I do it again next year, I will probably just run a top 32 by taking the new X quests of this year and the top 32-X quests from the Swiss round.

I ran the Unique ally championship in 2015: https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/184799-unique-ally-championship-2015/ [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/184799-unique-ally-championship-2015/]
 

You do a much better job of the tournaments with the brackets and extra rounds and what not though so you should definitely run the next one Seastan =)
