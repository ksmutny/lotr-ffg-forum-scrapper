So tonight I had my first crack at solo play. I usually play 2 player with a friend and solo had never appealed to me- until after moving house and the missus discovering that she can get strictly come dancing on catch up that is! I though I would add my opinions for you to peruse at your leisure!

I must say that I found it very enjoyable, it certainly changes the dynamics of the game! I used the same deck that I use in 2 player (I want to keep it to use in my 2 player games) and must add that I am a Bilbo player! My deck was comprised of Denethor, Elrond and Glorfindel (Spirit). I found that questing was easier when only revealing one card from the encounter deck, it made it a lot more predictable which was nice- in 2 player you can get a jump of up to 6 threat on a regular basis, without considering surge! Fighting became a much bigger deal though, especially when the encounter deck threw enemy after enemy at me, nothing worse on Anduin than finally killing the first troll and the second coming straight out of the deck!

I managed to complete the first 2 quests this session (I always have to play in order!)

Passage through Mirkwood- This was relatively easy, scored 126. The higher score reflects the fact that it was a constant slug through enemies- almost every revealed card needed killing as opposed to questing!

Journey down the Anduin- Got killed on my first attempt, had an excellent set up out but when my threat ticked to 35 i got swarmed by enemies and just couldnt cope with the sheer numbers the encounter deck threw out. My second attempt was one of my best at this quest, scored a 130 and didnt have to many enemies to deal with. Questing was smooth and nothing too nasty from trecharies!

Escape from Dul Guldur- Failed twice, second time I came quite close but a mishap in the form of a dead hero ended it for me!

Â 

All in all I thought solo was good fun, and I will certainly be making some more time to fit this in! Not sure it beats playing 2 player though, I really enjoy the social aspect of these games! Going to have to beat Dul Guldur to move on though!

i played solo from the start of this game until about 4-5 months ago when a friend introduced me to two handed solo play.

i have to say i much prefer this over the hair pulling frustration of solo play. i mean i loved the game playing solo, but it was dissapointing when ranged/sentinel cards came out, and this is a really great part of the game design.

its also better being able to see more cards on the table at once and really be able to get some good combos going

still, solo is a part of this game that has led to its success, so im pleased youve gave it a go
