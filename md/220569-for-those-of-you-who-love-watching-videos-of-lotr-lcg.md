The Progression Series was a big reason I got so attached to this game. The playthrough of the various quests was always entertaining and the card reviews were extremely helpful. I can't count how many times I've watched these.

Fantastic news Mitch and Matthew! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

This!

 

I randomly found the coreset in the recommanded products from Amazon, googled and found the Progression series on YouTube.

My favorite Videos about LotR LCG till today and indeed a great help starting to Play this game, saved me/us from getting totally crushed by the core set quests :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I really like these videos but I do hope that the presenter stops saying "I'm going to go ahead and" at the beginning of every other sentence. I don't know why but it absolutely drives me crazy and once I noticed it I couldn't stop noticing it every time. I do like the way he says "encounter card number one!"

Strangely enough, I think for me what makes the Progression Series so good is that Mitch and Matthew articulate very well (I'm not native), sufficiently loud and clear. Of course, they are well versed in the lore and mechanics of this game. The player card reviews were very instructive and the overall thing is extremely well produced.

 

So I'm very excited to see them coming back into the fold.

Just saw there is a doc with some Details linked.

 

Anyone else surprised they are going to do a full restart? The previous Videos are not lost and as they Play Progression style not much is going to Change, is it?

It's essential that the Gandalf bit from the Hobbit cartoon makes an appearance with every utterance of the word... every utterance!

Hive Tyrant?! Now you have me interested. He does such good work with his videos.

I was a fool of a Took to have abandoned the LOTR community for so long. I absolutely cannot wait to reboot the Progression Series! In fact, you could say that the first installment is due within a couple of days...

I would absolutely love a complete Saga playthrough that follows the Saga rules. Hero deaths & threat increase, boons and burdens and all that. I haven't done that since I'm waiting for all 6 boxes.
