This is actually really cool. It'd be neat to see someone do this format in English as well. How were the points given? Was it based on difficulty rating of the quest?

Yes, I'll second Ian. I'm very curious to hear more about the rules. I would read the Spanish, but it's late and my bear-brain has a hard time with that much translation.

From what I gather (knowing no Spanish at all so mostly a guess) there were a bunch of participants who played each quest in the Dwarrowdelf cycle 3 times each, and posted their win/loss/score. Their win/loss ratio was calculated, as was their total score (adding up all points from wins) and average score (total score / # of wins).

 

The total loss % for all players combined was also calculated on a per quest basis. The difficulty was then assigned based on this percentage. So if players lost the quest 0-9% of the time it would get Difficulty 1, 10-19% = Difficulty 2, etc.

 

I think it's a brilliant idea and sounds like a good way to get the "effective" difficulty for a quest. I'd love if someone started it here.

Well, I'm not the one who made the algorysm, but I've watched it, cause I'm implementing it in a webpage in which players will directly introduce their results and it will calculate all things, (and it also serves as a quest log for the spanish community, because EDGE, distributor of the game in Spain has removed it from his web...)

 

The formula really considers so many other parameters, each of them for a given scenario, and with all of them, it gets your final score for it. Your final scoring is the sumatory of all the scores in all scenarios for the event.

 

The considered parameters are:

 

1. Your ratio of wins in that scenario

2. Your best score.

3. All of them, are modified by the calculated difficult of the scenario. (F.ex., if you win your 3 attempts in a scenario with a difficult 10, you'll get a bigger bonus that doing the same in a difficult 2 scenario).

 

Anyway, I just "copied" the formulas, who made it was another user of the community, so I don't remember it at 100%.

Also, dear Beorn, if you remember, it was for that web which I asked your permission to use links to images on your website.
