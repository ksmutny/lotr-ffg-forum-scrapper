 What do you use of the second boxed set for a game with 3 or 4 players?

The threat trackers and for deckbuilding options if you don't use the starter decks.

Just the cards for the player decks and the extra threat counters and tokens. You don't combine the encounter sets is that's what you're wondering. What I have done is I have made up permanent encounter decks for the different quests, ( I have bought extra encounter sets separately) so I don't have to assemble the encounter deck every time I want to play. I just choose a quest and pull its encounter deck out of the box :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Nothing - since I don't have a second box. gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]

I've not felt like I'm missing anything important, particularly in three player games (I've yet to play a four player game, but don't expect it to change my opinion).

I've played a number of three and four player games using just a single core set.
