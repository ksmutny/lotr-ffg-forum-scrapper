Sorry if this has been posted before but I'm a new player.  Given the current unavailability of the Mirkwood Adventure Packs, I invested in some of the Saga packs instead.  My question is how difficult will these Saga quests be if I only have the core edition and what cards come with each Saga pack?  Will it be feasible to do these quests without having built up decks with cards from various Adventure Packs?  Enjoying the game thus far but want to get fully comfortable with the core set before heading into the Saga.  Many thanks in advance!

I think the general consensus is that certain quests in the Saga expansions are virtually impossible if you just have the core set. However, if you are ok with playing on "easy" mode then there should be no problem.

Thanks for the reply - I'll try easy mode first and see how it goes.

I argued in a similar thread recently that the Black Riders box can be very difficult even when you own everything released, so Easy Mode is probably your best option. Hope you enjoy the game!
