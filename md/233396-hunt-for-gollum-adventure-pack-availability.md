I can't seem to find this pack anywhere (other than sellers wanting large sums of money). It says it is waiting for re-print, but it seems to be stuck there. Anyway to get it to move forward?

In the upcoming tab it looks like that cycle is awaiting a reprint.

By waiting.

Yes, I noticed. But there has been no updates since August. :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

They do reprint everything every so often; you're definitely not out of luck forever. You could try picking up the Saga expansions in the meantime, maybe?

Hi!  Check Amazon.  DAILY.  Two days ago it was on there for 15.00, today it was 27.74, (That's like, half the price of a giant robot right now, what are they smoking?)  people know that Kazad Dum and this adventure pack are the beginning and opportunists move to make sure you have to pay to get "in."  I circumvented this whole process by diving in at a much later point in the game's life cycle but that won't work if you want to "play in sequence."  I sincerely hope there IS a massive reprinting of these and those opportunists get stuck with like a hundred.  It'll serve em' right!  I hope you get one!  : )

Yeah be sure to keep an eye on Amazon. I bought mine for just under $15 a  couple of weeks ago. Amazon has so many third parties selling now that the prices get ridiculous after the reasonable sellers run out. I looked today and it was almost $40 which is just crazy. Hopefully the reprints will be available soon.

 You can set up a pricewatch via camelcamelcamel.com. So you don't have to check everyday.

Thanks. I'll keep an eye out on amazon. I'll just have to be patient.

UK usually takes 1-2 weeks longer than the US.

It's arrived in the UK now - Chaos Cards have just updated their stock anyway.

It could be worth to check out. camelcamelcamel.com. You can set a pricewatch on any amazon item there. Once the price goes below the target you set, it will alert you.I often manage to get things at half price this way. Some sales are realy only a day and you can find them without having to actually check yourself.

I'm sure camelcamel sells off my data but whatever I get to buy stuff on discount and I can still decide not to do it if I've bough too much already.

My FLGS for Lord of the Rings has a high success rate with helping people find packs. I suggest emailing them and see if they can help. HighlanderGamesAndComics (at) gmail (dot) com
