Greetings community!


 


Here is my situation. I am playing Assault on Osgiliath solo, and on the first round, I drew The Power of Mordor during the staging phase, which reads : "When Revealed: Count the number of encounter cards in the staging area and shuffle them into the encounter deck. Reveal an equal number of cards from the encounter deck and add them to the staging area. This effect cannot be canceled."


 


That effect removed all the Osgiliath locations from play.


 


On the quest card, it is written : "If the players control all Osgiliath locations in play at the end of the round, they have won the game." Does that mean that I have won the game, because there is no Osgiliath locations in play at all? Thanks!

Strange victory! Seems like the encounter deck did not want to play with me... I've heard that, sometimes, Nightmare version of scenarios corrected that kind of, say, "flaws". Does the Assault on Osgiliath Nightmare version correct this?

Yes. It starts with a location you can't travel to unless you control five locations.

Yeah, Power of Mordor is a really stupid card in general, but especially so in that quest.

I've won that way before too! It's actually not terribly uncommon. That particular quest is pretty much not worth playing solo unless you get the Nightmare deck. It's really strange that it made it through playtesting, to be honest.

Yes, it is random in such a peculiar way. The feel of the quest is quite fun though - even if the mechanics is not the funniest to engage in that game, the whole ambience and vibe about the parts of the cities, roaming orcs and hamrad phallanxes... Haven't played Blood of Gondor nor Morgul Vale yet, but for me, this scenario is like The Hills of Emyn Muil or The Long Dark : mot memorable from the mechanics point of view, but there is something about the scenery that's doing it for me.

Yeah, you're right--the theme is really good in that quest; it's a shame it's so easy with low player counts that it can actually defeat itself. All is fixed in the Nightmare version, though, if I recall. Hills of Emyn Muil is much better in Nightmare as well, actually. I'm glad that they go back over these quests after a year or so so that even the ones that fall flat still have a chance to become fun quests.

It seems they only playtested 12 player.

If I remember correctly, it is the same for The Siege of Cair Andros. (not a silly win, but a misserable playtesting with the The Power of Mordor treachery card)

In that quest you place three locations in the staging area. Each loaction removes a (future) stage. If TPoM appears early, you have to face all of the 5 stages and later on eventually a location pops up which says you can remove a former stage.

... oh yeah. I think it happened once. Traumatic experience, totally forgotten it, until you triggered it just now.
