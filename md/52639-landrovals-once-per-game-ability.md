So, Landroval saves a hero, using his one time per game ability, and then meets his maker.  I bring in another Landroval.  Does the new card now have the one per game ability as it is a 'different' Landroval card or was it consumed by the first for all Landrovals?

I assume that it is once per game per Landroval. So if he uses it then dies or goes back to my hand for some reason, I don't have another use if I bring another copy in play.  However, I don't know that the rules address it.

Thoughts?

I would guess that it's the ability that is limited to once per game, not once per game per card.

But this is only my interpretation.

I agree. This is likely what they were going for but they definitely didn't make the text clear enough.

Once per game, per Landroval?

Once per game, per hero?

Once per game, period?

 you can trigger this ability once per game. So ability was used is done. Another Landrovar not help.

 It's gotta be once per game, period.  Otherwise, how do you know the next Landroval you play from your hand is the one you bounced back, and not some other, different Landroval.  If it's anything other than once per game, the restriction has no meaning.  (And once per game per hero is just a ridiculous reading of the ability.)

 I second the ridiculous reading of the ability comment! Here, here! That man should be king!

People will try and twist wording to their own desires. At the rate that cards are questioned FFG would have to 'clarify' every last card they release.
