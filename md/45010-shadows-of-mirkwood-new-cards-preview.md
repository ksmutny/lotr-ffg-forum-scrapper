I found this on a Spainish publishers site. It comes from the Shadows Of Mirkwood Cycle. Hope You like it!

Summoning Rohirims [http://www.edgeent.com/v2/edge_public/img_ilustrativas_noticias_blog/el_senor_de_los_anillos/SdlA_Convocando_Rohirrim.png]

The text reads: Title - Summonig Rohirins - Event

Action: Search the top 10 cards of Your deck for 1 Ally card with Rohan trait and ad it to Your hand. Return the rest and shuffle Your deck.

Great find!  I wonder how many Rohirrim allies you would need in a deck to make this card worth using?  Tenish?

Crap, guess I am building a Rohirrim deck too. They were always my favorites of the Free Peoples.

It will already be useful with only one ally...let's say there is this one ally you really really need to get your deck going: You add said ally three times and also this card three times, which basically gets you six copies of that ally. At a cost of only one this card seems quite powerful in my view...and getting even better if you have a whole bunch of powerful allies in your deck! I'll definitely want to play that card!

 If you have only three copies of your ally in your deck, Summoning isn't that good.  Assuming you draw a starting hand without the ally and with this Summoning, using the card only gives you about a 55% of finding the ally.  45% of the time you waste a resource AND waste a card.  Those aren't great odds.  You are much better off simply playing with an additional ally.  Compared with Summoning, an ally card works 100% of the time and is cheaper.

The question is, when does having this card become more useful than simply replacing it with an ally?  The happens when a) you can reliable use it to draw an ally with little risk of coming up empty, and b) when you have a variety of useful allies and the card allows you some flexibility in choosing which ally you would like to deploy.

This card is more than usefull.It reminds two cards from Lotr TCG (a wizard is never late and simbelmyne).If you have three allys and the three of them are very important for your deck you must put 3 or 2 copies of them just to come fast.But 3 copies of each ally is a waste for your deck and this card solves all your promblemsgran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif].

Those who are familiar with the Lotr TCG they can understand what i am saying and maybe they can explain better.

I just want to clarify that I think that this can be a very effective card, it will just require you to shape the rest of your deck in a specific faction.  You need a host of Rohirim allies to make it work.  Cards like Simbelmyne and A Wizard is Never Late allowed you to search your whole deck (they are, what magic players would call 'tutors') to find a specific card.  That gives you a ton of flexibility allows you to include "silver bullets" (a powerful card, useful only in specific situations, that you can search for when needed) and allows you to drop the number of cards of specific types that you would otherwise include in your deck.  That becomes even more important if drawing one of a card is useful, but drawing multiples of a card is not.

Summoning, however, doesn't give you access to the whole of deck.  If you want to be able to reliably find a card, you are still going to need to play with two or three of them in your deck.  Thankfully, most allies are not unique, so drawing multiple copies of the same ally can still be quiet useful.

Maybe we miss a combo.Maybe there is a card that allows you to search your deck and put a number of cards on the top of your deck and then you can use the Summoning card???The answer and  the game is very close nowgran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif].

It's a good card if drawn early, not so good if you draw it late. In the earlier example, if I draw one or more of the 3 Rohan in my opening hand, every time I draw the Summoning card it becomes a less than optimal draw.

I don't think this has been brought up, but it also gives you the ability to shuffle your deck whether or not you take a card (I think). There may be times when this is useful.

And ffgfan, great spoilage...keep it up, I appreciate it and I'm getting tired of waiting for this game to be released.

 Is anyone able to make out the title/text of the card to Bilbo's right?

 Looks to me like it's called "Orc Horse Thieves" and the text reads

"Doomed 2.
Orc Horse Thieves get +1 [Attack] for each location in the staging area"

Speaking of combos, Summoning and Sneak Attack  work amazingly well together, once we get a sufficient number Rohan allies to create a viable "toolbox" of effects.  The combination allows you to see the adversaries you face, search for an appropriate response, and deploy it in any phase, for a very reasonable cost.  From everything we have seen thus far, Rohan cards fall under the Spirit and Leadership spheres, so this would seem to be a natural combo.

Can anyone read the text on Haldir?

I think it just says 'Ranged. Sentinel.', and then a flavour text.

Yes it does just have those two skills.

But pretty good stats to go with those keywords, useful a lot, espeically if they have an 'unkneeling' card which I am sure they do/will.

For the card to be more than a 1x inclusion, probably 6-7. Now if it read "take any number of rohan allies".....

I got some news about those Adventure pack - I heared about the release dates. Here they are:

Hunt For Gollum - May/June 2011

Conflict At Carrock - July 2011

A Journey To Rhosgobel - August 2011

So it looks like this summer will belong to LOTR LCG.

I think the game will disappear from store shelves, at the latest, no more than month :-)

In Poland I get a mail with massage, Galakta's sends the game today, but we must wait to monday, probably :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

Geez i can't wait, when postman  comes to my house...

Ok, so we know that  Shadows Of Mirkwood will have 6 Adventure Packs. We know the neames of the first 3 of those. But can someone try to read the names from those?

mirkwood-lineup.png [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/ffg_content/lotr-lcg/Shadows%20of%20Mirkwood/mirkwood-lineup.png]

The last one is Return To Mirkwood but it's hard for me to read the others.

Just read on the French site that Imrahil of Dol Amroth will be the Hero for the Journey to Rhosgobel pack! He's going to be in Leadership. Very cool.

Certainly a worthy hero, but not one I had expected to see so soon. Very cool though!

A new card sighting on the French Site. I think this should be with Hunt for Gollum.  It's title is something like "Fireside Stories" with text, "Each player draws 1 card" You can try to place the quote if you like :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

The art of Haldir is awesome but you can't have random characters like Eleanor and Thalin as heores and characters from the books  like Haldir as an ally with no abilities.And don't tell me that he has the sentinel and ranged keywords cause in solo play those keywords do nothing.

Please FFG give some respect to Tolkien's charactersenfadado.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/enfadado.gif].

The quote is translated like : "It is a nice story, also sad, like all the stories of Middle Earth, but it can give you courage". It's from the fellowship so of course the original writing is better if someone want to find it ;-)

## 31 [Apophenia on June 8, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45010-shadows-of-mirkwood-new-cards-preview/?do=findComment&comment=482513)

 A one cost Leadership card which causes all players to draw a card? In a three of four player game the card will definitely see play. Almost certainly won't see play in solo because all it does then is reduce your deck size for the card of one. In two player it is approximately equivalent to Valiant Sacrifice. Since Leadership tends to have a fair amount of extra resources I can see the card being useable.   

## 32 [Mestrahd on June 8, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45010-shadows-of-mirkwood-new-cards-preview/?do=findComment&comment=482520)

I like them giving card draw to other spheres as well. Like you said, they already had Valiant Sacrifice, but this gives them more. Awesome with 4 players!

Haldir's not bad either. One of Lore's glaring weaknesses is combat, and Haldir is a 2/2/3 with Ranged and Sentinel so he certainly helps out in that department.

Well that makes Boromir a likely Tactics candidate.
