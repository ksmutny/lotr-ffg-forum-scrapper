If you have a character with the Freezing Cold Treachery attachment applied to them the lovely condition it comes with is that they cannot commit to a quest.  When you draw an Avalanche treachery card it has a "when revealed" action that requires you to exhaust all ready characters and if it is the quest phase commit them to the quest.

So, the cards appear ro contradict one another.  Does the character with the Freezing Cold condition have to commit to the quest or not?  I played it that the Avalanche overruled Freezing cold and they had to commit to the quest.  Thematically this seems to make the most sense as an avalanche would get a character if they were freezing cold or not.  It's also the nastier option as if they have freezing cold on them they have -2 willpower and if it is the last phase of the quest there is a good chance the avalanche will force them to be discarded since their willpower is likely 0.  In fact, this is exactly what happened to poor Beravor when I was playing last night (not to mention the avalanche also took out 2 Northern Trackers, a Zigil Miner and a Miner of the Iron Hills - very nasty card if you get it in Phase 3 of the quest).

Would like to get input on whether my interpretation is correct.

"(1.14) The word "cannot"
If a card effect uses the word "cannot", then it is an
absolute: that effect cannot be overridden by other
effects." (FAQ, p. 4)

Dam is right--the "cannot" phrase on Freezing Cold will override the second part of Avalanche!'s "when revealed" effect. The hero in question will still exhaust (since Freezing Cold does not prevent exhaustion), but he/she will NOT become committed to the quest. Ironically, then, Freezing Cold can actually become a sort of protection against an otherwise-fatal Avalanche! at the end of Stage 2B.
