Is that 50 cards necessary for your deck because i have only core and khazad dum sets, so good deck making is kind of difficult  :blink: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_blink.png]

50 cards is for a tournament legal deck.  If you haven't got enough cards, don't worry! Play with what you've got and enjoy the game!
