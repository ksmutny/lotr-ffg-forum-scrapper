So I have created some custom cards using strange eons. After adjusting clarity to 600 pix. when I went to print the photos,it appeared they do not fit in the 2.5"X 3.5" provided by printing studio templates correctly. The top of the card is just slightly cut off. I am using the lotr plug-in, so I thought the card size would be automatically set. Any of you had this problem/know what needs done?
