Is there a valid action window after an encounter card is revealed that requires a hide test during A Shadow of the Past saga quest?

 

Example - Sam Gamgee commits to the quest.  The encounter card revealed calls for a hide test.  A Fast Hitch ws recently attached to him (Sam loves his rope!).  Is Sam able to tug on the rope to ready for the hide test?  Or is he left fumbling with the sailor's knot?

The action window for a hide test comes after you've committed characters and revealed the encounter cards for the test. So in this case it's safer to commit Sam to the quest and use Fast Hitch right away if you also intend to have him ready for hide tests. It's not ideal, since Sam has a built in readying mechanic, so you'll have to feel out how much you need him at any given time. Hope that helps.

Thanks for the response. After a second playthrough using the "action window before hide test" strategy I had a hunch it was wrong. It seemed to ease the "oh crap" feeling of the hide reveal a little too much. Time for a replay!
