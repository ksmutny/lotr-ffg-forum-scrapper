It's a shame IMO that we're getting so teased about Saruman making a ring of hi own with the mould (it's pretty obvious), but we're not actually getting a card about it. No magical ring attachment or anything. Boo. They wasted a great opportunity for theme exploration, FFG.

But if they do such ring - it'll need to be attached to Saruman.

I just hope that next cycle we won't support a villain. <_< [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_dry.png]

Well, in this timeline he may be not a villian in his heart yet.

Not necessarily.

He was making it for himself. Who else?

When did you turn optimist? And where is the REAL Trololo? :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

The mechanics of the cards don't always have to be compatible with the theme. It has happened before: eagles in Moria, Steward of Gondor on anyone else than Denethor or one of his sons, heroes riding two horses, the fact that we're able to use Saruman in The Road Darkens, etc. in fact the only exceptions are the rings of power we have so far and all those other character specific attachments. The game is also about "what if" scenarios, so just making a wizard's ring card and being able to use it on heroes is just cool, and you could invent a reason why we have it pretty easily. It's more about representing Middle Earth as thoroughly as possible, with all options available, rather than taking some of these things so literally in terms of theme.

I'm at work but want to make proxies of some of these new cards real quick, does anyone have access to their cards now and can tell me the measurements of a card? Pretty sure its approx 6.5cm by 9cm but just want to make sure :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

## 11 [Gizlivadi on November 14, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/127059-race-to-the-forge/?do=findComment&comment=1333760)

6,6 cm x 8,9 is what I use, so yeah something along those lines.

## 12 [PsychoRocka on November 14, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/127059-race-to-the-forge/?do=findComment&comment=1333762)

Also the art on all the locations is magnificent, absolutely LOVE seeing the artwork for the ruins of Ost-In-Edhil. I'm also really looking forward to getting art and also being able to do missions in the North East of Eriador where all the ruins of Arnor and Angmar are!

Love the art on Bellach's Scout!

 

Anyone else think of Raiders of the Lost Ark when they see Bellach?

Considering the the bad guy in Raiders is named Belloq... yes ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

Wait til you read the insert... "He's got the other half of my map with him!" And "He's searching in the wrong spot!"

By the way, this eye on his chest is weird.

## 18 [Dwarf king Bronze beard on November 14, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/127059-race-to-the-forge/?do=findComment&comment=1334895)

This pack looks fantastic. Galadriel, Nenya and Galadriel's handmaiden would fit perfectly to my questing deck, but i don´t have any money right now...

 

And as Trololo said Bellach's art is really weird because of that "eye" in his chest. Otherwise the art of this pack looks excellent and mechanics are also very interesting.

## 19 [Glaurung on November 15, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/127059-race-to-the-forge/?do=findComment&comment=1335325)

Yes that eye is really strange…… like a superman mark

## 20 [DarkPhoenix on November 15, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/127059-race-to-the-forge/?do=findComment&comment=1335397)

Have to be a really good spy if he have eye of Sauron on his chest and people are not suspicious of him.

It's one of those Jaws T-shirts.
