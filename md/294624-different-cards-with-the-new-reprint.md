It seems that with the new reprint, some cards have been modified.

See below  the example for  LEGACY OF DURIN”.

It also seems that the modified cards will be inserted in the next faqs.

Do you have any news regarding this changed cards?  Do you know if there are other cards that have been modified during reprinting?

I can't recall another time when errata'ed reprints arrived before the FAQ was updated to include the errata—has it ever happened before?

Not sure why they are doing it in 2019. Not many players use dwarves swarm nowadays,  no new card combo arrived to require to nerf this cards after so many years ( like silvan did for horn of gondor) and the card did not lead to game breaking chain. 

Granted, it was OP. No discussion there. But still hard to understand the nerf since it is not more powerful that new brand hero who has no limit to his ability.

My guess is we're getting some more Dwarf cards in this upcoming cycle that would have broken LoD. A preemptive errata of sorts.

I would prefer they complete the  full development  of archetypes left midway: eagle/creatures, hobbit, woodman ( we miss a couple of allies and attachments there. Why did we not get an Woodman Axe giving +1 attack boosted to +2 when active location has an attachment?).

The post-errata Legacy of Durin is still a usable card, good enough even to be a staple in dwarf decks.  At the heart of every broken combo deck has been resource generation and card draw, and fixing that by requiring exhaustion is a much better solution (preserving the common case) than changing the way the card works entirely (poor Horn of Gondor).

BUT I do NOT expect any new dwarf-related cards in the next cycle (or beyond) to have *required* this errata.  A dwarf that can effectively infinitely be returned to hand and played again for free will not be released.  This looks to be a power-related nerf, weakening dwarf decks (though not as badly as the WANI nerf did) to make it the card they wished they had released in the first place -- at the cost of affecting the utility of hundreds of published decks and weakening the first "power deck" a progression player can make.  I don't like that, and I fear what other nerfing errata is lurking when the next FAQ comes out.

Yeah. Especially if you consider that the encounter decks have been playtested against the non-errataed cards, and so the power of the encounter deck is tailored to decks with those cards available. Thus, if they are not careful, nerfing cards like this can make the game harder.

It's quite reasonalbe for players playing progession stile to play erratas progession stile too. At the end if you played quest when released with only cards available at the moment you would have played these cards as orginally designed. 

Think if they errata stewars of gondor. It would improve the general status of the game now in 2019 but would make almost unbeatable cycle 3 quests designed back then with a difficulty creep considering players where using steward of gondor.

But let's see.

Bear in mind that new players playing progression style *now* are the same people who are going to pick up those Dwarrowdelf reprints and get the "fixed" Hama and Legacy of Durin, never seeing the pre-errata versions.

You are right here. They might use the FAQ to backtrack changes but it would be more things to keep in mind in a game already quite complex in that regard. 

 

Make me think I might come back to core set and role-playing all quest progession stile with modern erratas just to see how much difference I will find in game difficulty and deckbuilding approach...

As someone who was able to play through the Dwarrowdelf progression style for the first time thanks to the recent reprints, I'll say that I found both cards to be excellent.

Hama/Feint is *still* great in Shadow and Flame, even though both of those cards have been nerfed.

This is a devastating attack on hero defenders.

While ABB's lack of exhaustion made it a far more powerful card, and certainly a staple for any heroic defender with lore -- there's absolutely no way that ABB could create a "broken" situation requiring errata.  Are there any *positive* errata?  I understand errata has a cost, but surely the cost is higher to nerf widely-used card than to enhance widely-ignored cards.

A Burning Brand is in over *9000* decks at ringsdb -- all are now worse, sometimes significantly worse, than they were pre-errata.  Is Steward of Gondor next?

To be fair, I always thought A Burning Brand was overpowered. And by the way, no one is forcing anyone to play with the any errata.

This nerf to Burning Brand makes it rather more likely that I might actually use it again at some point.

Funny I constantly have about eight decks built and I run exactly zero copies of a Burning Brand between them. Always seemed a wrong design compared to the othe shadow cancellation but I also don’t use Lore defenders repeatedly.

Yes please, those cards are super overpowered.

To the people whining about Burning Brand, I have to ask: How often do you attach Burning Brand to a character with two other Restricted attachments, where you really couldn't manage without one of them? And how often do you need the same defender to cancel more than one shadow effect in the same round? Because those are the only times the errata will make a difference.

I play often 4-player games where I use Beregond to parry about 2-3 attack per round if not more!

 

but may be you are right and I should not whine. I guess I am always in time to ressurrect Gloin + Elrond and Warden of Healing combo

Yes, but how often do you need to cancel more than one shadow effect while doing so? In my experience Beregond laughs off most shadow effects, and in the rare cases he does take damage we have healing.

in my opinion, in a 3-4 players game, too often.

Is just how the game has been designed. There are many nasty shadow cards.

And actually, your argument can also be used to ask why then the **** do we need an errata on Burning Brand?

I always wonder, when people say this, what do you do if you play 2-player and the other guy has the reprinted, errata'd cards? Two verisons of Burning Brand that operate differently?

How about: When Northern Tracker exhausts to commit to the quest, place 1 progress on X locations in the staging area.  X is the number of players in the game.

In order of which cards I think really need errata, starting with "good heavens, how does this card even exist!?":

Blood/Fire: I have two options in mind. One is more simple, preserving the standard use case while preventing massive abuse of the effect. "Spend one resource from attached hero's resource pool to give attached hero +1 attack (or defense, for blood). Limit 3 times per phase."

The second option is a much larger change, but leaves a card that is more interesting to play, I think, and preserves the massive attack potential of the existing effect while still removing the potential for abuse. "Discard [blood/fire] to give attached hero +X [attack/defense] until the end of the phase, where X is the number of resources in the attached hero's resource pool."

Warden of Healing: Nowhere near as bad as Blood or Fire, but it's still much too efficient. I think that it's base stats and effect are in the realm of just design around it, but it's reading response definitely needs a "limit once per round" errata.

Steward:  Is probably fine.  Maybe make it enter play exhausted?

Courage:  also probably fine, but I wouldn't mind if they made it "limit one per hero."

Test of will:  no errata.  It is probably the most meta warping card in the game, but I don't think that you can change it without destroying it, and the game needs it.

Vilya: extremely powerful. Broken? I don't think so. Needs errata? Probably not. If anything, give it "attached character cannot be readied by player card effects," just to make the cost of the action less easy to overcome.

> 8 hours ago, Yepesnopes said:
> 
> And by the way! For when an errata on the northern tracker!? That is so OP that the whole location mechanics of the game is wrapped around it!

 That's another simple one. "After northern tracker commits to the quest, place one progress on up to X locations in the staging area, where X is one more than the number of players in the game."

I'm actually more concerned with Asfaloth. At the very least, make it restricted. There isn't much else to do without completely reworking the card. The best I can think of is to make it restricted, remove the "2 progress if attached to Glorfindel" ability,  and instead make it like Snowmane. "If attached hero is Glorfindel, asfaloth loses the restricted keyword."

Heh, great minds think alike. I like one more than the number of players, just to make it more worthwhile in solo, but your version is perfectly serviceable.

We probably won't ever have that issue because we only play with my set of cards. But if we did it's easy enough to say they work differently from each other, agree to use the errata or agree not too. It's a pretty casual chill game haha. Heck my wife and I when playing 2 player as well as our 4 player group plays sleazy mode with the extra resource at the start.

I don't get the purpose of errata for a cooperative game. Just play it however you want to. If you get enjoyment from finding a strong broken combo then fill your boots. If you want to make things really hard for yourself play Fatty solo against Carn Dum. Play however you want to, its just you and a few really close friends. If you go to an actual event then for sure agree on whatever restrictions or errata you want. But in my opinion unless something is legitimately misprinted like an encounter card or quest being impossible to finish I don't see the need for any errata. I'll keep playing Hama, Caldera and Boromir the way they were designed originally and not worry about an extra level of complexity.

I'm with you. I'm also not going to run a list of changed cards. I have a mix of cards that have been errata'd and some that have not. Makes for honest game play and no holds up while we look up the new text

What I really hate is when they errata Horn of Gondor into oblivion like that. It is hard as it is, you pay quite a bit for your cards, then soon they are meant to do something else than what is written on them. In case of Zigil Miner, at least it makes sense, and the card is actually more fun, but Horn is now just bad, so please, admit, and errata it again to make it better again. And more, errata bad cards, like Taking Initiative if I remember the name, I think no one ever played the card...

I don't pay attention to the shadows I discard, but I'd be surprised if I didn't cancel more than one shadow effect in the nearly every quest (putting readying on hero defenders is a high priority).  And in Carn Dum it happens frequently, even solo.  Losing a hero defender is by far my most common reason to scoop, so if you need to cancel two shadows *even once* in a quest, it can matter a lot.

How often do I intend to put two restricted attachments on a ABB target?  Let's see.  In Dori, Outlands and Dwarves, I want to put ABB on LeAragorn, also with Gondorian Shield and Celebrian's Stone (restricted, for no good reason).  Ring of Barahir gives him Lore for ABB.

In Dori and the Twins, ABB is meant for Elrohir, courtesy of Song of Wisdom.  Elven Mail, Gondorian Shield, and Armored Destrier are all restricted targets I like on him first -- Armored Destrier at least partially compensates for the nerf, except that the restricted ABB makes it less likely for it to be playable.

In Dori, Side-Quests and LeEomer (unpublished), ABB is meant for Fastred, courtesy of Song of Wisdom -- and he needs it with only 3 hp!  The intended restricted attachment is Raiment of War, which simultaneously buffs his defense and HP.  Oh, and it takes two restricted spots so it can't be mixed with ABB *at all*.  Thanks a lot.

In Dori and the Rings, Elrond is the ABB target.  He also is the target for Gondorian Shield and Elven Mail.

In Dori and Boromir, TaBoromir is the ABB target, courtesy of Song of Wisdom.  He is also the target for Gondorian Shield and Armored Destrier -- originally that was just to save threat, but after Boromir was nerfed it assumed new importance.  It could also mitigate the ABB nerf, except that they made it restricted and now there's not room -- he needs his shield.

In Dori and Rossiel, Rossiel is the ABB target, and also for Elven Mail and Gondorian Shield.  This is the fellowship least affected, both because Balin is in the fellowship and because she's not also a Steward of Gondor target, the Shield is just a flat +1 for her.

In Dori and the Silvans, Celeborn is the ABB target, courtesy of Song of Wisdom.  Elven Mail, Gondorian Shield, and Armored Destrier are all available.  Celeborn is also the Steward of Gondor target, as he is in a Leadership/Lore Silvan deck, together with Song of Wisdom he can.

In Dori and the Ents there are two possible targets -- LeFaramir is the eventual defender with Song of Wisdom (to help pay for Green ents), and he also wants Armored Destrier and Gondorian Shield.  The other target is Treebeard, an excellent lore defender to handle early defense if needed -- but he can't have restricted attachments and is now cut off from ABB.  The best lore defender -- no ABB.

In Dori, Traps, and Rangers LoFaramir is the ABB target, and only Gondorian Shield (limit 1) is an intended restricted attachment.  That's because this fellowship was constructed before Armored Destrier, an ideal card for LoFaramir to take advantage of his trap-enhanced *attack*.  But there's no way to put ABB, Gondorian Shield, and Armored Destrier together anymore.

In Grima meets Dori (unpublished) LoDenethor is the target along with Gondorian Shield -- once again, this was put together before Armored Destrier, which LoDenethor would absolutely want -- he wants to be ready post-defense, not only for another defense if necessary, but to use his ability.

The restricted hits hard, very hard -- my favorite ally target for ABB was Wellinghall Preserver -- decent defense, good hp, self-healing.  Freed from shadow concerns they can block some minor enemies.  No more.

This is, by far, the most popular card ever errataed, and both changes to it are major; but I think the restricted hurts more.  And the errata *cannot* be justified as being part of a broken combo.  This is straight up the designers saying "Wouldn't it be great if Carn Dum were even harder to beat?"

By far the most popular? Kidding?

I know you are good with numbers at ringsdb but for me it is one of the least popular. But I am guessing there may be many others who like Boromir, Horn, Hama, and even Caldara, at least as much as the Brand.

Pages of decks (30 to a complete page) at ringsdb:

57 A Burning Brand

41 Horn of Gondor

15 TaBoromir

9 Hama

6 Caldara

Even Horn of Gondor, despite being a core card, doesn't match ABB.  And heroes can't match the deck count of widely-used cards in a sphere -- even SpEowyn is in "only" 49 pages of decks. I think only Gleowine (59 pages) outpaces ABB among lore cards, and that by not much despite the huge advantage of being in the core set -- 7 of those pages are core-only decks.  Warden of Healing (87 pages) and Daeron's Runes (95 pages) are the only lore cards more used often, I think -- and Warden of Healing and Daeron's Runes can justify their existence in *any* lore deck, while ABB requires a lore character who will be defending.

Now are there those who feel more deeply about Hama or Caldara or Boromir than ABB, despite them being less used overall?  Certainly!  Heroes are less widely used, but you start with them in play, and the errata to Caldara/Hama/Boromir made some decks designed around their abilities cease to function as written; I have an unpublished Hama deck designed to use his ability to toss Elven-Light -- not compelling with the nerf.  There are four pages of decks *named* after Caldara, and only one four with "Burning" in their title:  "Burning Brand in Gandalf's Hand", "Deck Tech: A Burning Erkenbrand" and "Arbestor (Beregond is Burning Out)" (two versions of that one).  And as you might expect, the Erkenbrand deck doesn't have ABB in it.  Nerfing ABB doesn't *kill* any deck that used it -- however it makes every deck that used it weaker and the heroes that used it more fragile.  There might be a handful of decks where the intended target wasn't an ent, never readied, and never had two restricted attachments, in which case the nerf did nothing -- but I've never made such a deck myself.

And it worries me.  Horn of Gondor was part of an actually broken combo, several other cards being errataed before they got around to fixing it the wrong way.  Legacy of Durin's unrestricted draw was an important part of setting up a WANI/Legacy of Durin loop.  But this is different -- this does nothing to fix *any* abusive combo -- this isn't protecting other players, this is protecting the encounter deck from all shadows getting nerfed.  I don't like that, and I especially don't like it when the single quest most affected by the change already is arguably the hardest in the game.

Conversely, this is actually what I like most about this erratum: it protects the encounter deck from what is (was) to my taste the most boring card in the pool. Now it is a bit more interesting to deckbuild with, for many of the reasons your earlier post detailed re: difficulties with some of your extant fellowships.

I think a lot of criticism along the lines of "well, how do I win this quest(s) now!?" here is really more about those quest(s) than BB. Heirs/Against the Shadow has too much shadow-chaining; Carn Dum is essentially a NM quest in normal sheep's clothing.

I firmly believe that if BB had never existed in its original form, and we got this new version released in the latest pack, the general reaction would be that it's a solid card. There would be comparisons to Armored Destrier—pluses and minuses, people would say it's weaker, others would counter that it was a good option for Lore, etc.—but overall no one would call it a coaster.

This hits the progression and limited-pool players harder, I grant. But I do not fault Caleb for choosing to mitigate what feels like the biggest design mistake in the pool from the standpoint of repeatedly eliminating drama that is supposed to be intrinsic to the framework.

While I agree whole heartedly with your overall point, I would argue that Blood/Fire represent the biggest design mistake in the current pool. Burning brand is a clear second, though. :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Thanks. It is pretty tight with Horn though, and Brand only came two pack after the core. The restricted keyword makes sense, I think that was the reason, it makes more sense than a horse, for instance. But I do agree, it does make all those decks weaker...

There would be comparisons to Armored Destrier—pluses and minuses, people would say it's weaker, others would counter that it was a good option for Lore, etc.—but overall no one would call it a coaster.

I certainly agree with you -- and in fact, it would be highly praised, because (absent ABB) all that you have in Lore to aid defense is Protector of Lorien (which costs cards), Dark Knowledge (which isn't much help) and Cloak of Lorien (restricted to elves).  Lore has heroes with good defensive bones and healing, but *absent* shadow protection the best defender in the core set (Denethor) or the best (conditional) defense in Lore (Rossiel) isn't going to live to be healed, having only 3 hp.

Now if ABB hadn't existed, maybe in the many cycles there would be more lore cards that help out hero defense along the way, and this new ABB would be seen as a big thing, the great attachment that *finally* vaults Lore defense into top tier.  But that's not what happened -- Lore had ABB, ABB was fantastic, it didn't get anything else along the way.  You can, I think, fairly argue that a weaker ABB way back in the Mirkwood cycle might have changed other cards released along the way -- certainly that argument has been made for Steward of Gondor enough times.  But all those subsequent cards have already been released, and undoing an early "design mistake" doesn't change the fact that the subsequent quests and cards were designed in the context of the *original* card, and the more powerful the original card, the greater than influence is.  Carn Dum was *designed* knowing that ABB could ignore a whole stack of shadows, the errata has made that impossible.  Rossiel was *designed* knowing that ABB could completely protect her fragile body from shadows -- now it's partial.  Treebeard was *designed* knowing that ABB could make the high-threat hero one of the best defenders of the game, at the expense of not using his damage-enhanced willpower or attack -- now the self-injuring hero is completely vulnerable to shadows because he can't have ABB at all.  In short, even if an early game "design mistake" has affected subsequent development, undoing the "mistake" does nothing to change subsequent development -- unless you start doing positive errata, and that just doesn't happen.

Aside from taking both restricted spots, Armored Destrier works exceptionally well with the new ABB, since it can remove the shadow from a second defense while ABB protects against the first.  The downside is that it requires songs or sentinel-granting to get both on the same hero, except for Lore Aragorn.  Since Armored Destrier can't remove the *first* shadow, it's not really in competition with ABB.  Staff of Lebethron is more of a direct competitor, and was already the superior card for some quests, though it's certainly more narrow.

I think the big winners in a multiplayer environment are likely to be Balin and Erkenbrand.

But any evaluation of errata should not just be limited to before/after -- the cost should also be taken into account.  *Any* errata imposes a cost by virtue of having cards not actually have the effect printed on them, this has been used to argue against the idea of positive errata for coasters, despite the expansion of the effective card pool that follows.  But when a card is not a coaster but a widely-used card, this effect is much, much larger.  ABB is in over 1500 published decks at ringsdb, and as an early card ABB has had much attention and study, along with recommendations to new players -- all of that is now obsolete.  The nerf to ABB is better than the nerf to Horn of Gondor (for example) in that its essential function hasn't changed and the "common case" of a single attack with a single shadow is exactly the same (at least if you can spare the restricted spot).  But that doesn't change the fact that hundreds of decks just got weaker, *without* any broken combo to require an errata.

Absent other cards and a handful of quests, ABB still is "repeatedly eliminating drama that is supposed to be intrinsic to the framework", because no Lore characters self-ready or defend without exhausting -- ABB still provides *complete* protection against a single shadow from a single attack.  It's certainly true that you can load up a hero with song of wisdom (if not lore), ABB, a host of readying effects and defensive attachments and repeatedly eliminate the "drama" of shadows against many attacks -- but now we are talking about the combination of *many* cards and much deck space to set up that scenario, a large investment in intentionally eliminating the drama.  And who suffers?  The person who did it?  No -- they did that *on purpose*, and were exposed to the intrinsic drama repeatedly while getting set up.  The other players watching the defender?  Possible, but making Beregond (non-Lore) more vulnerable to shadows won't stop him from taking as many defenses as possible, because that's what he's designed for and that's all he's good at doing.  (He's also less vulnerable to shadows because he starts with the highest def/hp, and exists in spheres with shadow protection events).  I was rather under the impression that meetup players *liked* having a player provide sentinel defense and would not be pleased for sentinel heroes to die more often -- perhaps that's not the case.

I think it's worth protecting other players -- but I don't think it's worth protecting the *encounter deck*, which has no feelings to be hurt.  I don't want to see the designers nerfing cards just for the purpose of making the game harder, but that appears to be exactly the motivation for this particular change.

I wonder how many actual errata there've been if you take away all the typos, fixes to do with spheres of influence (like Narvi's Belt), and obvious corrections to how a card is intended to work that didn't actually change the card.

The best I can think of is to make it restricted, remove the "2 progress if attached to Glorfindel" ability,  and instead make it like Snowmane. "If attached hero is Glorfindel, asfaloth loses the restricted keyword."

As I have no sympathy for the encounter deck, it does not disturb me that tools exist to prevent location lock, quite possibly the least fun way to lose a game.

Asfaloth has the best protection against abuse already -- he's unique.  That limits him to a total of 2 progress placed, and that requires Glorfindel.

Actually, I now remember the interview to Caleb done during the Lure of Middle Earth this year.

 

Interestingly enough, he said his biggest disappointment was the Dunedain trait, in particular the Warden of Annúminas. If I remember correctly, he commented that upon conceiving the Dunedain trait, he thought that the mechanics of keeping enemies engaged with you would be very cool. To this, a friend of him told him "but who would want to keep enemies engaged with him?"

Well Caleb, you just shot yourself in the foot...

This is not even close to true. I can no longer find a PDF of the original rulebook, but the Learn to Play is 32 pages and the Rules Reference is 29. The FAQ is 19, and of that, only two and a half pages are actually taken up by errata.

1. Um, what? Staff of Lebethron was never a better choice than Burning Brand assuming either could be attached. With the errata it's a bit closer, but Burning Brand is still better (which is fair, it costs more).

2. The fact the essential function and common case haven't changed directly contradict your claim that 'all of that is now obsolete'. Some of it may be obsolete, the decks that stacked a Burning Brand hero with readying effects to ignore all shadows forever are obsolete (but that was a broken case which needed to be fixed), and some decks now have one Restricted attachment too many (but many of those can be reasonably tweaked to manage without one of those attachments). Very little has actually been made obsolete.

3. You say there was no broken combo which required errata, and then later go on to describe the case of stacking Burning Brand with readying effects and other defensive attachments - which is a broken combo that (imo) required errata.

4. From my own perspective, I don't think nerfing Burning Brand makes the game meaningfully harder, because any quest in the game could be beaten pretty reliably without using it. It *was* (part of) one method of making the game a lot easier and, notably, less interesting by removing the aforementioned drama - the game is designed on the assumption that shadow effects are something the players will have to deal with to some extent, and Burning Brand on the right target made it too easy to just excise that entire aspect of the game.

To my mind, this Burning Brand errata is actually the perfect kind of errata, in that it blocks the broken case while leaving the common case untouched, as you yourself noted. From my own personal perspective it also rehabilitates the card to the point where as mentioned, I'm now much more likely to play it myself.

I mean, he was absolutely right, the Dunedain mechanics are very cool. His friend was clearly wrong.

And if your implication here is that you can't play Dunedain and keep a bunch of enemies engaged without pre-errata Burning Brand, I can tell you from substantial experience that you are also clearly wrong.

My implication is that the Dunedain archetype is already of little appeal as shown statistically from the number of decks in ringsdb (so may be his friend was not wrong). Keeping enemies engaged is always dangerous.  Without burning brand, it is even less appealing.

You can play the archetype, for sure.

I want to note that with the new release of Outmatched, the Dunedain archetype was being boosted to a nice level.

From my own personal perspective it also rehabilitates the card to the point where as mentioned, I'm now much more likely to play it myself.

1) I said Staff was better in certain quests, and it is.  In Wastes of Eriador you can't cancel shadows at night -- but you can discard.  In the Lonely Mountain, reattacks can be triggered by shadows even if you have ABB -- but not if you discard them (and due to Smaug's high threat, you can *always* discard).  In Road to Isengard shadows to Saruman can do their wizardy effects even if you have ABB -- but not if you discard them (and due to Saruman's high threat, you can *always* discard).  And for Mountain Warg's you can keep them engaged by discarding their shadow.

Staff was just as good as the old-ABB in the case where you need to take exactly one attack from a high-threat enemy each turn (there are a number of quests like this), if you can afford the restricted spot.  Now it's better in that situation, because it's cheaper.  The new-ABB has lost some of its important advantages over Staff, but still retains some -- doesn't have to exhaust in advance of knowing the shadow, works against enemies of all threat levels.  But it's still much worse for Lonely Mountain.

2) The decks are only weakened, but the commentary is obsolete.  We had not along ago a fresh in-depth description posted by Silblade of the Conflict at the Carrock player cards.  He quite rightly raved about ABB, gave it six stars out of five, and compared it to SoG, Test of Will, Unexpected Courage, and Feint (one of these things is not like the others, IMO).  Obsolete.

The decks aren't obsolete, but they are published -- they are fixed, and no longer work like they did when designed.  This is a significant cost to errata.  Could those decks be tweaked to remove restricted attachments no longer fitting, and/or include additional shadow protection to cover for ABB's weakness.  Sure.  They could also be tweaked to think that SoW/ABB is no longer worth the work and substitute different shadow protection instead.  They could even be reworked to abandon hero defense entirely.  You're welcome to rejoice in all that future deckbuilding in light of the revised ABB, but for me I mourn for all the work *already done* that has been affected, including some of my own unpublished decks.  All to fix a problem that *wasn't* a problem to me.

3) Because I don't think being able to negate shadow cards *constitutes a broken combo*.  I see broken combos as something that *actually guarantees* victory, like the infinite resource/card combos that involved since-errataed cards like Master of Lore, Love of Tales, We Are Not Idle, and Horn of Gondor.  You've seen it before, Seastan posts a ridiculously powerful and uninteresting to play deck, and the next FAQ that comes along breaks one or more of the components to keep it from happening again.  This is worlds away from an effect that has been in place for *years* and was both widely used and widely enjoyed.  Stacking ABB with readying only gives you a finite number of shadow-free defenses, bounded by your readying, and merely makes defense predictable, as attack already is and questing can be in the presence of scrying.  Do you propose a limit on Erkenbrand's ability?  Do you consider the option given in the game rules to play without shadows at all "broken"?

4) I'll have to take your word that "any quest in the game can be reliably be beaten" without ABB, because I certainly don't reliably beat all the quests in the game even *with* ABB.  I don't rember *ever* beating Carn Dum without ABB, which is particularly shadow-heavy.  But I also don't make hyper-efficient decks a priority.  Yes, in my Dori fellowships I will sometimes go to lengths to get ABB on a heroic defender, since Dori *requires* a heroic defender to take advantage of his ability, but I know full well that I could make the game easier by not bothering with Dori and trying to turn a 2 defense or 3 hp hero into a Beregondish defender, instead just using the original article from the get-go.  That's *my* choice -- I'm OK with self-inflicted difficulty increases on the way to a shadow-free super defender.  I'm less pleased with the designers taking away my end-state, not to protect *other players* in a pick-up game, but to protect the integrity of the encounter deck after all these years.  They're taking away something I liked.  I appreciate that you didn't like it, and you didn't play it, so it expands your pool -- but is it worth the cost to others?

I agree that as errata goes, ABB *does* preserve the common case, and in that respect it's a better errata than what was done to the poor Horn of Gondor.  And the end result is a viable card, unlike poor Master of Lore.  But I don't agree that the uncommon case was "broken" instead of just not to your taste.  If the designers want to errata cards to address power level, I would prefer they target little-used cards to expand *everyone's* pool, not just nerf widely-used cards to make them more attractive to the few who consider them too powerful.  I'm not holding my breath.

Indeed.  Dropping the lore restriction would really expand the utility of the card, even with restricted and exhaustion added.

And before you cry foul on Path of Need, I agree. But I've also seen A Burning Brand on Beregond block every shadow effect on the table in a 4 player game with next to no effort. You don't need to have a endless readying to handle all the combat. Getting around 4 readies onto Beregond is easy, and is often all it takes, and there's no single culprit there. Targeting ABB is one way to bring that archetype more into balance.

Really interesting discussion!

I can see the annoyance over A Burning Brand - felt the same for my way-overused Boromir, but I still put him in the line-up, and now play with his errata. (Just have to rely on other characters doing some defence and counter-attacking). So Hasty Stroke, or Dawn Take You All, or Sterner than Steel may all benefit in the charts at ABB's expense.

To me, I think ABB was a combo - almost in itself. If you can basically ignore one of the frameworks of the game, that is pretty powerful. To stretch the point a bit, imagine an attachment that said "whilst attached hero is questing, cancel all When Revealed effects...". 

As the card pool has grown, so have the options for shadow handling. One way for the encounter deck to preserve itself would be to have more non-cancelable shadow effects - but that would impact all the counters, not just ABB (and "You can't cancel me" is so, so annoying!). Maybe errata on the card is the best way to limit it alone.

I rarely play ABB (mainly because I defend with a certain Tactics hero, and - probably due to poor deck design, never could get Song of Lore and ABB out as a reliable combo. Looking back at my games log, I did actually use it on Lore Aragorn when I finally won in the Battle of Carn Dum, but he'd fallen by the end to a double Vile Affliction with Gandalf in the discard pile). 

So the rare quest aside, from my experience the majority are perfectly manageable with the new-look Brand.

(And it makes perfect sense to me not to allow Treebeard to uses it. Why would a walking tree want to hold a burning branch???)

Targeting ABB is one way to bring that archetype more into balance.

I don't see using Path of Need to clear the field of enemies as "abuse", I see that as its intended purpose.  It's a 4-cost 1-per-deck, and is meant to be game changing.  The same applies to non-exhausting defense on the expensive events Light the Beacons and Hour of Wrath (which thanks to the Hama nerf can only be played nine times in a row).  I *especially* don't see Path of Need as abuse in multiplayer when *everyone* cooperates to avoid overquesting to build up their build state.  It's a co-operative game.  I understand the need for errata where a *single deck* can force a win or monopolize combat in a multiplayer situation.  But when *all* players at the table cooperate to keep Path of Need in play to clear the board of enemies, that's what they've *chosen* to do and it's simply not a problem that needs to be fixed.  And *no* solo "abuse" needs to be fixed at all.

The same is true of Beregond's normal action in a four player game, where the players cooperate to get Beregond set up for shadow-free defense with plenty of readies -- if they cooperate to do that, so what?  Beregond + 4x Unexpected Courage + Song of Wisdom + Gondorian Shield + A Burning Brand is an eight card combo involving three spheres and four copies of a single card, a single deck isn't going to make Beregond bulletproof by itself (nor would it necessarily be unwelcome -- isn't bringing Beregond to the table what you *want* your friend to do in multiplayer?).

And what are we bringing the superdefender Beregond more into balance *with*?  Yes, it raises the difficulty level, but that by itself is not intrinsically good.  But compared to other defending heroes, with the obvious exception of Beorn and Erkenbrand, the ABB nerf will bother Beregond *less* than any other hero -- he can get to 6/5 sentinel with a single cheap/free attachment, leaving a restricted slot free that other heroes need to get anywhere near Beregond's lofty stats.  He's also not native Lore, so weakening ABB weakens Lore defenders relative to Beregond.  Beregond will be fine, and in a 4-player game will require little supplemental shadow cancellation and healing to survive handling multiple defenses per turn, even with the change to ABB.  Meanwhile, Fastred can no longer do Raiment of War/ABB *at all* in my two-deck fellowship, and he will die from ordinary common-case defense.  Was making Super Beregond slightly more fragile so important than Fastred deserved this?

I quite like the idea of a hero attachment that says "while questing, attached hero is immune to all When Revealed effects", though it would really be a sideboard card.  ABB only affected one character, that only covers all shadows if you can ensure that character handles all defense.  That requires additional cards.

The last time I beat Carn Dum (with the help of 8 Grace of the Valar tokens) in the March solo league, my defensive options were Rossiel (3 hp) and Treebeard.  With ABB + Silvan Tracker + Ent Draught + Cloak of Lorien + Self-Preservation, Rossiel was able to take a single Thaurdir attack each turn and heal up.  After nerf, she's dead dead dead -- and Treebeard can't use ABB at all.  Nerfed ABB would've produced a result more like the Stereotypical Dunedain Deck (no lore) did against that quest -- 36 tokens and chumping with 3-cost Dunedain, since a fully healthy Amarthiul, boosted to 6 defense, was killed by shadows in previous tries.  *Every* entrant in the league (all of which did better than my not-built-for-Carn-Dum deck) used either Lore or Balin.

Why would a walking tree want to hold a burning branch?  Because they want to cancel shadows and are smart enough to hold the non-burning end?  It seems more plausible than Leather Boots or Mithril Shirt or Arod, all of which are perfectly legal on Treebeard.  The ents were not intrinsicly offended by fire, only by hewing down living trees to get wood -- and even then what they found most offensive was hewing *without* burning -- "It is the orc-work, the wanton hewing--rarum--without even the bad excuse of feeding the fires, that has so angered us."

On the very edge of Fangorn, the three hunters made a fire (while cutting no living wood) under a great tree, and Legolas said "Look! the tree is glad of the fire!"

"It may have been that the dancing shadows tricked their eyes, but certainly to each of the companions the boughs appeared to be bending this way and that so as to come above the flames, while the upper branches were stooping down; the brown leaves now stood out stiff, and rubbed together like many cold cracked hands taking comfort in the warmth."

Like with Eagles in Moria, the thematic disconnect has more to do with what *we* would expect, rather than any prohibition drawn from the text itself.

My last line was only supposed to be a throw-away quip. But catch it if you wish...!

Thematically, the burning brand was used to keep the Ringwraiths at bay - fire and light against chill and darkness.  The card translates that idea to a universal counter to surprises in combat, which it retains, albeit in a more limited fashion, post-errata.

And if the Battle of Carn Dum can only really be won by maximising the use of one particular card, (and I'm not arguing against that), then maybe it is the quest that is broken and not the player card.

I think the presence of the competitive format introduced at organized play events (where you can play 1v1) is alone enough to warrant "fixing" solo abuse. Anyway, with ABB the abuse is more common in multiplayer, so I won't expand on this.

I have watched multiple decklists from myself and others get Beregond loaded up with ABB and enough readies to handle defense for all players all by itself in short order. He becomes completely invincible with ABB, and nobody else at the table has to deal with defenses the whole game. This is an example of one player trivializing a big chunk of the game for all players, due to ABB.

I am normally only interested in my friend handling all defense for the table if I am bringing some kind of questing/support deck. If I am bringing a combat deck, he will be making my gaming experience a lot more boring, because it will always make more sense to defend with ABBBeregond than any of my characters.

>

It's not Beregond that we are balancing. It's ABB. I picked Beregond as an example because I happen to see him abuse it the most. But lore Denethor could be used too - he's only 1 less starting defense, but he's got the trait match for Gondorian Shield and is in-sphere for ABB. Lore Bilbo was another culprit due to Fast Hitch. The problematic combo is not Beregond+ABB, it's readying+ABB. And out of those two options, nerfing ABB is way cleaner and easier with less far-reaching consequences.

> Quote

Carn Dum's "thing" is its shadow effects, so it makes sense that nerfing ABB would have the biggest impact against this quest. But even so, ABB has never been needed here. Just last week I had a challenge with The Mormegil to build a thematic Rohan deck that could beat Nightmare Carn Dum with a decent winrate. He put together this deck that won 3/4 times, with no ABB in sight: https://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/11986/nmcarndmrohanchallenge-1.0 [https://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/11986/nmcarndmrohanchallenge-1.0]

I put together a deck that used Grima as a defender with ABB and Protector of Lorien to boost his defense. Even playing with the ABB errata in mind, I still managed to win: https://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/11992/rohannightmarecarndumchallenge-1.0 [https://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/11992/rohannightmarecarndumchallenge-1.0].


Maybe the quest is just so hard that people think they absolutely need this one exact card in order to win. That would be bad quest design. Hopefully, by errating ABB and forcing people to look at other options, they will realize that this isn't actually true.

I've always considered the Fastred archetype to be top tier, and have never used Raiment or ABB in my deck, so this seems like a reach. Spirit has plenty of in-sphere shadow cancellation. Tactics has some too. Trying to shoehorn ABB onto Fastred with a Song of Wisdom would slow my deck down quite a bit and probably make it worse. Who knows, maybe your dependence on ABB has made you overlook some more efficient options, and your decks will actually improve as a result of the errata.

To have Beregond set in a 4 players game, you need Shield of Gondor, song of wisdom, burning brand, and a bunch of readying effects (most likely Unexpected courage).

To do technically the same with Erkenbrand you need, Ancestral Armour, another attachment (like Hauberk of Mail or Citadel Plate) and a healer (which will be anyway on the table), and a bunch of readying effects (most likely Unexpected courage). Having into account that you do not have to cancel all shadow cards, this combo needs the same amount of cards to set up. I don't see why not getting an errata on Erkenbrand then.

 

Not to mention that in multiplayer you can trivialize combat with Gloin as well.

I do think we'll start to see a similar issue with Erkenbrand dominating. But currently he's an underused card, and errata tends not to be preemptive. Maybe he will be hit in the future.

Gloin needs Elrond and Warden of Healing in order to trivialize combat (though shadow effects can still ruin your day). Do we know for sure that neither of those cards were hit by errata?

Your deck-building skills are impressive. Just curious... would you be able to build progression-style decks with similar win ratios vs. standard Carn Dum that incorporate the new errata (if you would use any of those cards, like ABB, at all)? Solo and 2-player?

I want to believe that it can be done... but I'm not convinced that it can.

EDIT: And as far as I'm concerned, if cards are errataed in such a way that a particular quest can no longer be beaten with the card pool that was available at the time of release, that's just a BS thing for the designers to do (I intend no disrespect).  

At this point, I would just prefer they go on and release a second edition rather than keep monkeying around with errata each time they release a new cycle.

I did it progression style with a few decks when it came out. Here's a Vilya one that does not use A Burning Brand: https://youtu.be/aqwhWuL664E [https://youtu.be/aqwhWuL664E]

I've also beaten Carn Dum in minimum purchase mode (just using cards from Core, Lost Realm, and Carn Dum), which is way more restrictive than progression. Granted, I did play on easy mode for that one: https://youtu.be/6RsWSCYvJ_g [https://youtu.be/6RsWSCYvJ_g]

I have packs from the most recent printing (including new wording for Legacy of Durin) and as far as I can tell Elrond and Warden of Healing haven't changed. 

 

Don't know if this is widely known but Erebor Battlemaster also has a change that isn't in the most recent FAQ - his attack bonus is capped at +4. 

 

Haven't noticed any others for now.

I am sure you can make a deck with Erkenbrand that trivializes combat as much as with Betegond 😉

I made one last week, the same day I heard about the Burning Brand errata. Haven't tested it in 4 player yet though.

This card has the dubious honor of been errated twice!

What about errating twice Horn of Gondor? I throw an idea "Response: When an enemy is added to the staging area, exhaust Horn of Gondor to add 1 resource to attached hero resource pool." It is even properly thematic!!

Honestly, that Erebor Battle Master errata isn't that bad, although it makes me think Booming Ent will get a similar errata.

They should just put a "limit X per round/phase" on every effect they print. It would solve a lot of problems.

While I believe that most of these errata would make sense for new cards, in general I have not been a fan of FFG's aggressive use of errata to revise numerous existing, already printed cards for a non-competitive, co-op game. Too many errata makes playing and deck-building more complicated and for relatively little added value that I can see. Without competition, there's little reason for concern over OP cards, IMO. There are plenty of voluntary ways to make the game harder for those players that don't get enough challenge with the cards the way they are.

I really like the Taboo List alternative they've come up with for Arkham Horror. It's optional for those who want to shake things up, it doesn't invalidate any printed cards, and it allows a lot more experimentation (e.g. if they find they've over-nerfed they aren't stuck with that decision, and if they've under-nerfed they don't have to issue yet another errata, as with Erebor Battle Master).

As a fan of A Burning Brand, I can see why it got errata. It being restricted is interesting, maybe a bit puzzling, as it already has the Lore requirement and exhaustion seems more limiting than 'once per phase'. I can't recall, but is there a way to unexhaust attachments with a card effect or ability? It's still a good card but not amazing anymore.

It would make sense even if erebor master battle in a swarm deck could easily reach non-sense attack level while booming ent is a bit more difficult to set up and mantain to similar numbers.

 

I agree this errata is not devastating an equivalent  +5limit  with dain is still very good as intended without arriving to non sense level like slain a dragon or a balrog almost alone

 And now he is more in competition with different alternatives like dwarven axe on allies (3 resources for 4 attack or 1 for equivalent 2?). 

But in general I don't like all this errata on old cards unless there is a very good reason for them. And either FFG is just spending time addressing 6 years old design mistakes for no real reason or they have in preparation something which make necessary all those changes....

Maybe campaign design for old cycle similar to saga mode which require all those errata for balance reason.

They are certainly not addressing design mistakes, otherwise they will addres cards like Brok Ironfist (and many others like him) as well.

Since they're revisiting old cards,  "Power in the Earth 3x" and "Unexpected Courage 1x" back in the Core set seem like they could use an easy fix just exchanging the amount provided, no need even to resorting to errata.

Ugh, that's a good point.  Competitive brings with it demons that cooperative lacks, and one of the big reasons I prefer LOTR to competitive LCG is that I'm free to run quirky/suboptimal/thematic decks without any fear that I'm going to "lose" to an optimized deck.  That no longer holds true if I take the competitive events seriously.

With that said, I would greatly prefer that cards deemed unbalancing for competitive one-deck be handled with a Restricted list for that format rather than spoiling the fun for everyone with an errata.

Tactics has some too. Trying to shoehorn ABB onto Fastred with a Song of Wisdom would slow my deck down quite a bit and probably make it worse. Who knows, maybe your dependence on ABB has made you overlook some more efficient options, and your decks will actually improve as a result of the errata.

I've never thought of Fastred as an archetype, let alone top tier, just as Dunhere and LeEomer's best friend.  I've played Fastred without ABB/Raiment of War -- I did use Raiment of War in my mono-spirit Dunhere/SpBard/Fastred deck for the solo September league, and that was a lot of fun, thanks to SpBard I could use Raiment of War and Hauberk of Mail, with the Mirkwood shadows and Hasty Stroke that was sufficient for me (non-nightmare).  But my Black Serpent fellowship (using all cards from that AP) used both, and my not-yet played Dori, Side-Quests and LeEomer relies on both cards for Fastred.  He's only 3/3, he needs Raiment of War just to get where Beregond *starts*, and Rohan's defensive Golden Shield is strictly inferior to Gondorian Shield for Fastred.  It always annoys me when erratas damage a deck/fellowship before I get around to playing it, and since I have so many decks in that state it's almost inevitable it will happen.

Spirit has a lot of shadow cancellation events, Hasty Stroke being the most important (and given my fondness for hero defense, I'm leaning towards Hasty Stroke being more important than A Test of Will).  But I prefer repeatable effects to one-time effects.  Forcing me to abandon the deck I *want* to play via errata is a cost *even if* I change the deck to being more efficient.  My decks aren't usually optimal in the first place.

But lore Denethor could be used too - he's only 1 less starting defense, but he's got the trait match for Gondorian Shield and is in-sphere for ABB. Lore Bilbo was another culprit due to Fast Hitch. The problematic combo is not Beregond+ABB, it's readying+ABB. And out of those two options, nerfing ABB is way cleaner and easier with less far-reaching consequences.

Now that ABB has been nerfed, do you not expect Beregond to still get loaded up with ABB and enough readies to handle defense for all players?  He can get easily to 6/5 with a restricted slot free and can survive most shadow effects with ease.

If a single deck can lay down six-seven attachments, most costing 2 resources, on a single hero all by itself in short order is the problem really ABB?  And are pickup players really disgruntled because they aren't *defending*?

Beregond will *still* monopolize defense when ready, but Bilbo and Denethor won't.  Denethor starts at 3/3, and has a sphere match for ABB, the change hurts him relative to Beregond.  Bilbo starts at 2/2 and has a sphere match for ABB, the change hurts him a lot relative to Beregond -- all those Fast Hitches are less useful when you can cancel only one shadow and are low-HP.  As a result of ABB changing, Beregond is now *more attactive* relative to other hero defenders not named Erkenbrand, especially Lore hero defenders.  I don't see this as a positive development in a game where Beregond was already easily the best hero defender.

True that the ABB errata hurts other super defender candidates like Bilbo and Denethor just as much, if not more, than Beregond. Beregond will still be the dominant defender in the game, and with his 4 base defense it seems he was designed to be. I'm not arguing that the errata will equalize the defender playing field. I'm arguing that it will make the whole "defend everything on the table with one character" strategy weaker.

It's true that Beregond tends to shrug off +X attack shadow effects, but many (the majority of?) shadow effects are not that simple. Here's a list of shadow effects from a recent scenario, The King's Quest:

1. Shadow: Attacking enemy makes an additional attack against you after this one.
2. Shadow: Discard an attachment you control.
3. Shadow: Deal 1 damage to the defending character.
4. Shadow: Defending character cannot ready until the end of the round.
5. Shadow: Attacking enemy gets +1 Attack.
6. Shadow: If this attack is undefended, discard an ally you control.
 
Beregond only shrugs off 5 and 6 (and maybe 3 if you've got healing out). And given that 4 could mean an instant loss if you are counting on Beregond defending for the table, you need to save ABB for that one and accept every instance of 1, 2, and 3.

That's sort of what they're doing. The errata aren't "forced" on anyone accept at an organized play event. You are still free to play them the old way at home or with your buddies.

Yes, the errata will be on the reprints, so in a sense new players will be "forced" to use updated text through ignorance (unless they dig up the originals online), but your complaints seem directed more toward a player who already owns the card having their current decks invalidated.

And Horn of Gondor. For one, the card should mention Boromir in the text. We have Firefoot and Snowmane for Eomer and Theoden respectively and they are not nearly as famous as the Horn and not nearly as connected to Boromir in the legendarium. It was the problem with the core set card because Boromir was not there yet, which was the shame, and I do not see why as he was clearly designed by then (the Mirkwood cycle). So I would like to see a new version of such a famed artifact that is actually well functional and has a bonus when attached to Boromir.

I play in a fellowship event once per year, so in terms of playing the cards there's little impact if I ignore the errata--aside from the psychological impact of playing a card one way when I know that by rule it is supposed to be played another way.  In general I'm a stickler for "playing by the rules" and prefer to play errata I disagree with and abide by designer rulings I find ridiculous.  If using a variant to make it easier I prefer it to be directed at setup conditions (like the Grace of the Valar variant does) rather than target specific cards.  Making something harder can usually be done within the rules by self-imposing restrictions.

But I also like to *publish* decks for the use of others.  I've published 17 decks that use ABB, none of them now work as well as when I published them and some of them wouldn't have ABB *at all* if it had been in its current form.  I could, of course, revise them, but that takes time and effort and I have lots of other decks waiting for the same vetting process before publication (some of which use ABB, of course).  This is a significant cost, and while few use my decks, there are over 1500 other published decks that took the same sort of damage.  I think when publishing decks it's a reasonable assumption that the latest errata will be used for them, and certainly that is what ringsdb will display for those cards when examining a deck.

I also like to *analyze* how cards are used in published decks, using that as the basis of articles or Stereotypical decks.  When the card changes, the basis of the analysis becomes flawed.  Analyzing how Hama *used* to be used is somewhat academic when Hama can't be legally used that way anymore.

I also like to post in forums here and BGG, and a lot of the posts that touch on ABB are affected by the errata.

I'm also one of the few to play in the solo league each month; since it is a low-stakes competition, it wouldn't be fair for me to use my version of ABB while someone new to the game is using the errataed version.

If you're in a four player game, you have healing, and Bergond has 5 hit points to work with.  So the shadows that can cause problems for mighty Beregond are #1, #2, and #4.  #1 is ignorable if it comes anytime when Beregond has an extra ready to work with, #2 can be safely ignored at least once with the SofW/ABB combo (Song of Wisdom is expendable), and may be ignorable other times if you have replacement card in hand.  #4 can be ignored anytime it comes up in the last defense (though if ABB is still ready at that point, it's moot), or the next-to-last defense (presuming that you ready *before* the shadow is revealed, which if you are relying on Unexpected Courage you certainly will).

Shadow #4 is most dangerous early, when ABB is least likely to be exhausted, and least dangerous late, when ABB is most likely to be exhuasted.  If you're planning on Beregond handling four attacks and have four readying attachments, the odds of taking even *one* non-Beregond attack are slim despite the change to ABB -- and unless you have insufficient allies to sacrifice to non-Beregond attacks, it won't even cost you a hero, let alone Beregond or the game.  (Since there are only three copies of #4, two showing up in the same round is not only unlikely, it also guarantees only one being left in the deck until it runs out -- #1 has only two copies.)

This is the difference between Beregond and someone less mighty, someone who relies on blanket shadow protection to *survive* multiple defenses.  If Beregond gets hit with multiple problematic shadows he might end up exhausted and someone else must defend or even chump-block.  A lesser hero might *risk death* if ABB is exhausted, even though ready -- this Beregond does not do, at least with this set of shadows.

You keep trying to say that it hurts other heroes more than Beregond. I haven't been arguing against this. I'll say again, that Beregond is still obviously a good defender even with the ABB errata. But if you don't see how this weakens the "defend everything with 1 hero" archetype, I'm not sure what else I can say.

What universe are you living in that you are able to claim this, based on what? There can be any given person with more decks built. It makes little difference, so it makes very little sense to make such a hollow egocentric claim in the first place.

If you read the text I quoted from Dale Stephenson, you'd see that we are talking about published decks on RingsDB being invalidated. I happen to have the most. You may read that at an ego flex, but I think it's a relevant reply to the conversation. The amount of your published work that gets invalidated by an errata should understandably effect how you might feel about it.

In his defence, your sentece is somewhat ambiguous: The first time reading it sounded like you were boasting about having caused errata:

I assume, Dalestephenson uses a Hauberk of Mail regularly, which is not restricted, and thus tends to see Beregond as a 5 HP hero, but I might be wrong.

That is what I love about board games: You can play as you want, even use house-ruling, if you feel so inclined. I used to play Lord of the Rings Online heavily from 2009 to 2013, it was one of my top 2 games ever, and being an online game it forced you to play with the newest patch (like an errata) whether you liked them or not. After the Helm's Deep expansion I stopped playing this game, as it was changed too much in a direction, I detested. If I could use an older version of the game, like I can with many others on Steam or through patching manually, I would totally do that, but due to the nature of an online game, this will never be possible, alas.

If they will be publishing optional lists with erratas to be used in oficial events (gencon...) or by those who prefer them, that would be giving a choice and not enforcing. Making reprints with errated cards is quite enforcing.

By the way, on the topic of the Erebor Battle master I am very disappointed as well.

Do what you want, designers. But give us those errated cards in a stand-alone package. It is increasingly more difficult to keep track of those errata. 
Especially if I play with more casual players - friends.

All errata has a *cost* by nature.  Whether the cost is worth the benefit for any particular errata is a subjective thing which players can and will reasonably disagree on.  The cost is not just affected by how much the errata changes the card but also by how widely the card is used in its original form.  ABB is the most widely used card ever errata-ed, and both changes are IMO significant to ordinary game play, not just edge cases.

I think when a card has been widely used for years, there should be a strong bias against "fixing" it to conform how it would've been designed in retrospect.  That A Burning Brand (or Steward of Gondor) would be weaker if redesigning the game from scratch is not sufficient reason IMO to redesign it *now*.  Minimal errata to prevent a truly game-breaking combo is acceptable; changing a card designed to provide blanket shadow protection because it happens to provide blanket shadow protection is not what I consider game-breaking.

I do use Hauberk of Mail regularly, but I just misremembered the 10-threat Beregond as 0-1-4-5 instead of 0-1-4-4.  The original Beregond is interesting in that most heroes with threat greater than stats have a cool ability to justify it, but Beregond's ability saves a handful of resources over the course of the game and isn't remotely worth an additional threat.  Only the excellent stat distribution justifies the additional threat, and I don't think any other hero pays a threat penalty for having well-distributed stats.

I certainly see how this weakens the "defend everything with 1 hero" archetype.  I'm just making the point that *how much* it weakens that strategy is dependent on the hero being used to defend, so a player who continues with Hero Defense has an even stronger incentive to use Beregond instead of a lesser defensive hero, with the exception of the Erkenbrand alternative.  So I expect the change to make Beregond more popular instead of less in that role, and I don't see that as a good thing.

I also don't see weakening hero defense as an intrinsicly positive thing in the first place.

I do expect the errata to make Silver Lamp more popular.

I don't want to turn this thread into a Beregond discussion, but to add to this I don't think Spirit Beregond's ability justifies the additional threat either. Nori has a similar (and one might argue better?) ability and he doesn't have any threat penalty.

To be more on topic, as a more recent joiner to this community most of my cards have their errata already printed and for the most part I have been playing them as such without much complaint. Horn of Gondor and Master of Lore are the really egregious exceptions to this, I have not been inspired to try and make either of them work.

The only cards I am aware of that I don't have printed errata for are Boromir and ABB. I played Boromir using his updated wording and found him fine, but it definitely hurts his effectiveness. I would still use him in the future.

For ABB I don't know yet if I will choose to play with the new wording. Certainly I think it is still a playable card. One thing that may change is my willingness to try and use it with non-lore characters. In a lot of cases I think it would just be more effective to include other Shadow cancellation effects rather than the the Songs etc required to use ABB more freely.

What do you think? Now that ABB has been errated it only feels fit that other OP like Steward of Gondor, Warden of Healing, Northern Traker... get erratas too, doesn’t it?

Steward of Gondor, if it were designed today, I think would certainly be weaker.  But Leadership has built on its back for years and it's a godsend for new players.  I would hate to see it be nerfed, and as a unique attachment that exhausts I don't think it seriously unbalances multiplayer.  It's fair to say it's the easiest way to power up obscene values on Blood/Fire, but putting a cap on either of those cards would be far less intrusive -- and having obscene attack/defense in the first place has diminishing returns.

Warden of Healing is the best healer in the game, but in absence of Elrond or loads of lore resources isn't *that* powerful.  I'd leave it alone, and apparently it's just been reprinted in its original form.

Northern Tracker, the indispensible remover of location lock should absolutely be left alone, since location lock is quite possibly the least fun way to lose.

That's a thematic nerf, but it amounts to taking Steward of Gondor completely off the table for at least 90% of the decks that use it.  That would make the change to A Burning Brand trivial, both in terms of number of decks and the change in functionality.

Note that anyone who prefers a Gondor-restricted version of Steward of Gondor can do so simply by choosing only to put SoG on their Gondor heroes.

Agreed that Blood and Fire deserve attention instead of steward.  Making them discard to use would turn them into interesting cards instead of boring ones. Making them run like song of hope would be less intrusive,  but less interesting.

Warden of healing probably needs a limit once per round on its reading response, but nothing more.

Northern tracker would be more fun if it placed progress on X locations in the staging area (x = # of players in the game, maybe plus 1), but doesn't actually need a nerd. Asfaloth would be a more fruitful look at location control nerfing.

I'm not sure what problem limiting the locations to the number of players (or players+1) is solving -- ensuring that even if a solo player is willing to shell out 4 spirit resources for a Northern Tracker, it won't actually fix location lock?  Northern Tracker as is already scales with player counts because locations in staging scales with player count.

Asfaloth, being unique, doesn't scale with player count, and at 2 cost is really only compelling on Glorfindel IMO.  But since 2 progress isn't going to be huge on 2-4 players, I again don't see a problem needing solving.

This reminds me of a rules issue relative to monopolizing combat in multiplayer games.  Engagement and attacks are strictly laid out by player, but the "declare defender" 6.4.1 in the online rules reference only mentions the active player, and only allows him to declare character he controls as defender.  At what point does another player get to declare a sentinel defender, and in what order?  I presume the active player can't commandeer someone else's character to defend.

If the active player has first dibs on defending, neither SuperBoromir (now with sentinel/ranged) nor SuperBeregond  set up by someone else's deck can defend attacks *against the active player* without the cooperation of the active player.  If a player wants to monopolize combat *and the other players let them*, how are they victims of the monopolizer?

It is indeed confusing, as Ranged is mentioned in the framework steps themselves, but Sentinel is not. You have to go to the glossary proper, RR Sentinel, for the appropriate rule/timing:

> Quote
> 
> Sentinel is a keyword ability. A character with the sentinel keyword may be declared as a defender during enemy attacks that are made against other players.
> 
> A character may declare sentinel defense after the player engaged with the enemy making the attack declares no defenders.

[emphasis added] Since player order isn't mentioned anywhere here, I guess it's technically a 1st-player decision as to who actually gets to Sentinel defend when multiple people are clamoring for it.

Which is exactly why I think that issuing errata should be an action of last resort! Because the question should not be, "How would this card ideally work, knowing what we know now about LotR LCG?". As you point out, a logical and thematic rewrite of SoG -- which, incidentally, would also help curb abuse of Blood of Numenor and Gondorian Fire -- would massively change the way the game is currently being played. In other words, the issuance of errata cannot simply ignore the historical state of the game and work from an assumed "blank slate". However, many errata that have been issued, especially this new crop, seem to assume just that.

Defending with ABB+Beregond is always a better strategic choice than any other defender. So while you don't literally take away someone's choice to defend, you do in practice, because people aren't usually willing to pointlessly risk the outcome of a big multiplayer game just for their own enjoyment.

"Game-breaking" has never been the only criteria for errata. If you look at all the errata'd cards there are many there, like Caldara or Boromir, that became so overpowered and meta-dominating as the game grew that the designers felt the need to nerf them.

There aren't actually that many heroes that can perform the "defend everything" role. The lore heroes, which you mention are hurt most by the errata, and for that matter any hero that does not have an intrinsic sentinel ability, had already fallen way out of favor due to the unlikeness of being able to play ally Arwen in a multiplayer setting. There's the Dunedain Signal option, but that doesn't seem as popular (probably because it leaves you needing another card for the defense boost).

Dain with Armor of Erebor is an option, but this is such a new combo that it doesn't have anywhere to go but up, errata or not.

Grimbeorn has 3+ defense and sentinel, so he's a candidate. But Burning Brand only appears in 1% of Grimbeorn decks, while it appears in about 10% of Tactics Beregond and 20% of Spirit Beregond decks (according to Ringsdb), so this errata seems to hurt Beregond more.

Erkenbrand is the only other hero with 3+ defense and sentinel, and we both agree that the errata favors Erkenbrand over Beregond.

Given the above, I'd bet that the errata will result in a decrease in Beregond's market share as a table-wide defender.

That's a shame -- surely the point of playing a game is for enjoyment, not to maximize the chances of victory.  Is it considered impolite not to bring a power deck to a pickup game?

I'm sympathetic to the problem of combat monopolization with strangers, the only case where a player acting alone can impair the enjoyment of others, but when they cooperate in losing that enjoyment in the interest of victory, I question whether that rises to the level of requiring errata affecting the enjoyment of the (surely more numerous) solo and coordinated play who do the same things on purpose.

I know "Game-breaking" is not the only criteria for errata -- but it's the criteria (along with misprints) that I think has been universally accepted by the player base and is clearly a sufficient reason for errata -- we might complain about the *way* a game-breaking combo was fixed, but not really the need for it.  No one complained about Out of the Wild errata.

Straight power nerfs are a comparatively *recent* development in the game's history, and I (and others) are not at all pleased that "the designers felt the need to nerf them."  I don't think there is an actual *need* to nerf them at all.  In a cooperative game, "overpowered" is purely subjective and "meta-dominating" is nearly meaningless -- this isn't a competitive game, where the most efficient combinations stultify game play by rendering less efficient combos unfun through constant losing.  The opponent is the game, and losing to the game *at a level the player prefers* is part of the fun.  Designers nerfing powerful cards they created and we enjoy, to try to tilt the losing level to something the *designer* prefers, I find obnoxious.

Caldara and Boromir were strong, but they were not the strongest, and in the case of Caldara didn't even have combat monopolization potential.  Caldara's errata was particularly obnoxious because Caldara was a little-used hero until the designers introduced new cards *specifically designed* to synergize with Caldara.  This is one of my *favorite* things that the designers do, create new cards that bring new life to old cards.  And having succeeded brilliantly by creating an archetype that was enjoyable, unique, varied, and powerful (though not more powerful than all other archtypes), they felt the need to nerf it.  Caldara's not as popular anymore -- it may be a reason for errata, but it's not what I consider a *valid* reason for errata, and I think it's done more harm than good.  YMMV.

There are a lot of heroes that *can* perform the "defend everything" role -- there just aren't any heroes who can do it better than Beregond, who starts with the best defensive stats in the game.  (I suppose once fully loaded with all possible attachments Hobbits are better due to Fast Hitch, but they need more cards and start very fragile).  It's harder to play Dunedain Signal on a Lore hero than to play Song of Wisdom on Beregond, but in a multiplayer setting not much harder, and if a Lore hero had Beregondish stats, I think people would manage it.

Gandalf has the potential too, as he starts with 3 defense, can take ABB natively when played from top of deck, and has Shadowfax to ready and give sentinel without using a restricted slot.  But he's higher threat than Beregond with worse defensive stats, and he blocks all Gandalf allies.

Grimbeorn is a recent hero and with his counterattack potential is very attractive for solo decks, I wouldn't read much into his lack of ABB decks.  I think he's *very* attractive as a defend-the-table candidate because his counterattack has no per-phase limit (future errata coming?) and does not require exhaustion.  But Raiment of War is a perfect fit for Grimbeorn and that's now completely incompatible with ABB.  Absent the errata I think Grimbeorn would gain popularity at the expense of Beregond.  I think he still might, since he's both shiny and powerful.

Spirit Dain is even shinier and at 4/5 for the first three attacks (if you're willing to discard) starts better than even Beregond.  I think the ABB errata may be a wash for him relative to Beregond, though he does block LeDain-loving dwarven swarms, which might be an unfriendly thing to do when playing with strangers.

If Beregond is so dominant already in 3+ player, simply because he's the best (caveat for the potential of Grimbeorn and Spirit Dain, both recent additions), then I'll concede that his major loss relative to Erkenbrand could cost him market-share in that particular slice of the LOTR world.  Meanwhiile, at 1-2 player a *lot* of heroes besides Beregond are used for hero defense, and practically all of them just lost ground relative to the game's iconic defender.  At that count the addition of Restricted may loom larger than the ABB exhaustion, at least outside Carn Dum.  I don't think weakening the *many* heroes who can be used for hero defense in 1-2 players is justified just to shift some of the defend-the-table action from Beregond to Erkenbrand.

This gets into muddy waters about what it means to "break" the game vs simply be OP, but I submit that the following errata are straight power nerfs:

* Beravor – dates back to FAQ 1.3 (2012)

* Protector of Lorien – FAQ 1.3 (2012)

* Nori – FAQ 1.4 (2013)

I'll stop there. As the game only dates back to 2011, I wouldn't call these "comparatively recent".

A fair point.  I'll amend my statement to straight power nerfs to long-released cards.  If Grimbeorn were errataed in the next FAQ to restrict the number of counterattacks, it wouldn't make much of a wave.  If the same errata came five years later, it's a horse of different color.

If Legacy of Durin had been nerfed back in 2013, I wonder if Nori ever gets errataed at all.

"Power nerfs to long-released cards is a recent development" is almost a tautology. You couldn't have nerfs to long-released cards early in the game life, because it was early in the game's life. But anyway, I'll grant whatever point you're trying to make here because I don't think it matters. "The developers have never done X before, so they should not do X now" is not a convincing argument, in my view.

Again, there is competitive organized play for this game.

What is a bit annoying about all this is also that the errata is taking place after so many cycles have been released and most of you veteran long time players have already got to use the "game-breaking OP awesomeness" or conversely used heroes during their normal progression release before certain attachments or combos made those cards stronger.

 

So for new players it's like "here are these same quite difficult scenarios but we are taking away the tools your longer-playing peers used to beat them or just straight up bypassing a particular cards moment in the light. Like when I opened and first looked  at the new version, as well as the only version (since it's printed on the cards) of Horn of Gondor or Master of Lore. And they are kind of lame and not great instead of being able to try to experiment and have awesome shenanigans with said cards.

 

I get that to some of you guys there is an organized play scene but I would counter and argue that the vast majority of players do not partake in that scene, and thus the balancing that they "needed" for certain cards would be much better suited with a restricted list, banned list, or alternate versions of cards for that specific one to two times a year event. Do that instead of making the vast majority of the player base's experiences more difficult by physically changing cards in new reprints. It's just harder, more confusing or just outright weird. 

 

But meh either way I don't much care, for me and my players Boromir will continue to blow his horn whenever I want to raise my threat. Just like Burning Brand will be able to be used multiple times if you have the readying. I'll play what's on the cards because it's simpler and more fun and as adults playing a cooperative game we can regulate our experience by changing things up if something is too strong or boring.

Defending loads of attacks easily with one character is fun, so we'll definitely not be using the Burning Brand change (particularly since we mostly use it as a "make Lore character better defenders" card rather than "make a super-defender Lore"). I feel sorry for those newer to the game who are going to get the inferior version and not be able to have all the fun we had.

Don't get the grumbling about combat monopolization at all. If your team-mate has the powerful combat characters that doesn't stop you from joining in the calculations of the best engagement and combat strategy. The person who gets to turn their card sideways at the end isn't really a big deal.

Losing is typically not enjoyable, especially when there was an easy path to not losing which was rejected.

I mean, I thought I'd made it clear that I didn't like the game-breaking OP versions of cards, and therefore I generally avoided using them to beat those scenarios. So I would view it more as "Here are the same quite interesting scenarios but we've taken away some of the nonsense your longer-playing peers used to make them less interesting."

Alo, I've never gotten much use out of Horn of Gondor, pre or post errata, but Master of Lore I still like when I can find a place for it.

Defending loads of attacks easily with one character is boring, so we definitely will be using the Burning Brand change (Particularly since it can still be used quite easily to make Lore characters better defenders, just not so much to make super-defenders invulnerable). I feel excited for those players both new and old who are going to get the better balanced version and will be pushed to find more creative and interesting combat solutions.

Statement 1: A player that dislikes an errata and plays without it suffers no harm to their enjoyment.

Statement 2: A player that likes an errata and chooses to use it receives a benefit to their enjoyment.

Support for Statement 1: This is a co-op game, and as such no one is forcing anyone to play a particular way.*

By the above, I conclude that errata has at worst a neutral effect, and at best a positive effect. So bring on the errata. Can't have too much, I say. Concerns about having too much errata to keep track of can be handled with:

I disagree with your statement 1 as a statement 1 guy. I would counter that if a player has a card that is printed with an errata it's harder to play it a different earlier pre-errata way. It feels almost like you are cheating. And if you are playing in things like the solo league then you feel dishonest playing it that way. And it's similar and even worse if it's an unprinted change.

In another game, X-Wing, which my wife and I used to play before this game, my wife's favorite build was Palpatine in a Shuttle with two wingman. She played it dozens of times against me. And we almost always played just the two of us. Beat me many times and I beat her a few back. But she was still getting into the heavier games at that time. 

Then one year they nerfed Palpatine and changed his effect to be "more balanced", we could still play the old way and we tried to but it ruined it for her and she eventually lost interest in the game. It felt like we were cheating or playing it wrong or making up your own rules to make it easier. And destroyed her favourite squad while at it.

This has the same effect on us. My favourite character is Boromir and when I read they changed his to once per phase I felt similar and he became less fun for me because I felt like I was again making up my own rules. We didn't and still don't have even half of the card pool so threat reduction isn't really possible so he wasn't abused. And even if I had everything and could make him raise his threat forever and the game gets too easy then I just change it up and play something else, it's a cooperative friendly game. But still when I play him now either I'm looking at his card and mentally attaching restrictions to him which is lame. Or I'm playing him with my "made-up" rules of no limit and feel bad. Kind of ruined the entire card for me. 

 

So do we keep playing him the old way? Sure but it's definitley become less fun using him and I feel like I have to play him a different way if I want to be legit. So = less fun to do as you said and be statement 1.

 

I don't want my wife and friends to lose interest in a game as their favorite combos are altered. That's not enjoyable to any of us and actually detracts from and ruins parts of the game because it's more to keep track of and you feel bad when you play it the old way.

 

Also how many erratas do you really want? If they changed every single card in the game would that actually be ideal? How is one supposed to keep track of all of that and wouldn't you feel bad if you won with a certain card or cards and afterwards realized/remembered it doesn't play like it has been changed to? I know we would.

 

What would be far far better in our opinion is just coming out with OPTIONAL restricted card pool/hero lists or specific erratas for an event. It lets guys that for some reason need help balancing a cooperative game be able to have alternate worse cards. And keeps things simpler and more fun for the casual players like us that help grow the gamer base instead of getting overwhelmed with extra text to remember or have to feel bad because we aren't playing it right, or not come out to larger events because the way we play is different then the way it's supposed to be now. 

 

Either way we reject erratas on player cards and hope they stop with them or change it to optional perhaps rotating lists and leave our physical cards and games alone. And we'll keep playing the old way while trying to not become disenfranchised with the game because of these changes.

I fully agree with @GILLIES291 [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/314461-gillies291/].

What you say Seastan would be 100% true and I would fully agree if they would not include the erratas in the reprints. Reprinting cards including erratas invalidates statement 1.

For example, I never had the choice to play Master of Lore the old way, because my copies are all already errated. It always looked to me a poor car so I never used it (I still do not and I have several lore decks). Then one day I learnt that the card had originally been errated. I looked at the errata and thought that it had been actually a cool card in its original form. Nevertheless, I never played it in its original form, contradicting the printed text. If I would do so, I might as well design and print my own cards with strange eons.

Even as a pro-errata guy, I sympathize with many of the points in your latest post. Errata do have a kind of psychic cost to them. (But I'd say that the contribution of errata to misbegotten wins is pretty minimal, compared to the hairball of rules that make up this game at this point, heh)

I guess I subscribe to an auteur perspective on this game: I want to play the game that the designer intends, since Caleb, though imperfect like all of us humans, has almost always earned my trust in him. He shapes the game with every new release—essentially all of us (who are not playtesters) have no idea what ends up on the cutting room floor, after all. To me, errata are just another way in which he shapes it, albeit one that he prudently does not use often.

I have printed all errata with strange eons, that way I will not forget to use them. But the bigger problem is, that there are so many translation errors in the older cycles of German version, especially in Heirs of Númenor, that you would never be able to play the game properly without knowing. E.g. Ithilien Road reduces the attack value to zero instead of the engagement cost, this totally alters the quest and makes the first rounds trivial in Into Ithilien. And there are a lot of similar errors.

> 14 hours ago, GILLIES291 said:

You have some good points here regarding Statement 1.

From my understanding, the main counterargument is this kind of "guilt" you feel if you play a card that has been errata'd the original way. And I sympathize with this. By nerfing a card, the designers have deemed it too powerful, so by playing with the original text makes it seem like you are playing on easy mode.

To be clear, I'm not trying to invalidate your feelings or anyone else's. You feel the way you feel. But maybe I can help by framing errata a bit differently.

I would suggest rather to interpret errata this way: That the designers have deemed the card too powerful given the current state of the card pool, going forward. You should feel 0 guilt playing with original text against any of the previous 100 quests that have come out so far. Why? Because they let the card stand as is for all those years. If they made the past quests too easy, they would have errata'd it long before. By waiting until now to do it, they are effectively saying that the rest of the card pool is developed to the point where we have so many readying effects, with likely many more to come, that A Burning Brand can be too easily abused.

Thousands of players have been playing the original text of A Burining Brand against the current collection of quests for years. The errata doesn't invalidate any of those wins any more than an errata in a competitive game invalidates the last year's tournament champion who happened to use the card. If players want to copy the old championship decklists in a competitive game and play them against each other, one could argue that they should in fact use the original text rather than the ettata'd text. Why not apply the same logic to old quests?

Now yes, the cards are going to be reprinted with the updated text. They need to be, because the game is still alive, and future content is going to be balanced around the errata'd text. For a new player entering the game, picking up both old content and new, it would be a negative experience for them to complete some new content only to realize they were playing incorrectly because they did not have the updated text. I honestly think this would be a worse feeling for a new player than the slightly increased difficulty in not having the original Burning Brand when playing old scenarios.

So I really feel that nobody should feel any guilt at all when playing old content with the original text.

As for future content, you might say that your enjoyment of those scenarios will not be as high as it would have been, because you will feel guilty about playing with the original text. That's fair. I would feel guilty too. But keep in mind there would be nothing to prevent a designer from loading up every quest insert with a bunch of extra rules to counter all the overpowered decks. Errata is simply a lot cleaner way of ensuring that their new scenarios don't get immediately stomped. We saw this when the Boromir deck rose to power and the designers countered with new scenarios all having shadow effects that prevented the defender from readying (which ended up harming other archetypes even more). Then Boromir was ettata'd, and now hopefully we will start seeing these effects die out.

Now, future content does not exist yet. So it's not possible for our enjoyment of it to go down from where it currently stands. This is where Statement 1 is coming from. If you won't find enjoyment from new content when playing either version of ABB, you are free to avoid purchasing it. The designers do not owe us new content that can be well handled by ABB. They don't owe us anything at all.

Nevertheless, despite having these discussions every time a new FAQ is published, many of them containing plenty of errata that I myself wish was done differently, it's easy for me to say that the game is in the best state it's ever been, and my enjoyment continues to go up every year. Boromir was my favorite card in the game. But I'm now enjoying newer cards more than I ever did Boromir. It's a living card game. Let it live.

I appreciate you taking the time to explain it a different way. And while I still don't like erratas in this game, I get where you are coming from.

I personally will keep playing the old way and continue trying to grow my collection. I just hope I can keep my wife and friends interested as their staples get nerfed down and we have to try to ignore rules changes, and not get too affected by it myself. It really does suck to have to feel like you are making up rules to play the game and use things you enjoy especially as newer players who don't have everything and/or are the target audience for these aggressive erratas.

Contrary to @sappidus, I am obviously not a pro-errata guy, but the same as him, Caleb has all my trust in terms of game design, or at least, in terms of scenario design 😛. For me, the last cycles (Dream Chaser, Harad and Rhovanion) are among the very best of this game, with a special mention to Mountain of Fire. Although it is a very tough end for the campaign, I have to admit the mechanics evoke perfectly the theme and tone of the books.

The time that elapses between release and errata impacts the cost of errata.  But it's got me curious about how long has elapsed for errata over history.  Unfortunately the pre-errata text is not given, so some of my descriptions may be off.

4/20/2011 core released

FAQ 1.1 (6/24/2011) -- no player cards

FAQ 1.2 (10/28/2011) -- no player cards

11/20/2011 Dead Marshes released

1/6/2012 Khazad Dum released

3/12/2012 Road to Rivendell released

5/16/2012 Long Dark released

FAQ 1.3 (8/1/2012)

Beravor (core) -- once per round

Protector of Lorien (core) -- capped at 3.

Zigil Miner (KD) -- only 1 resource per match

This is the first errata, and these can all be considered "power nerfs".  Beravor/Protector had been around for a bit over a year, but this is the first FAQ after the release of Zigil Miner.  Beravor/Protector both preserve the common case.

8/8/2012 Shadow and Flame released

8/17/2012 OHUH released

11/26/2012 HoN released

2/22/2013 OtDS released

FAQ 1.4 (2/27/2013)

Feint (core) -- protect one player

Thicket of Spears (core) -- protect one player?

Narvi's Belt (KD) -- not sure what changed here.  Exhaustion?  Phase instead of round?

Out of Sight (Long Dark) -- protect one player?

Nori (OHUH) -- add from your hand?

Thror's Map (OHUH) -- make Travel Action.

Master of Lore (HoN) -- only discounts one card

This FAQ is the first since Shadow and Flame, which I think prompted the changes to the two core cards.  Master of Lore was victimized by an extreme combo and was poorly done IMO.  This was the first chance to fix Nori/Thror's Map, both of which affected power though Thror's Map was *extremely* powerful in its original form.

5/31/2013 Druadan Forest released

FAQ 1.5 (7/26/2013?)

Ravens of the Mountains (OTDS) -- look at instead of "reveal" (positive errata)

OTDS was released so close to the last FAQ that this is probably the first chance to fix what was an unusable card.

October 2013 Blood of Gondor released

FAQ 1.6 (2/6/2014)

Erebor Battle Master (Long Dark) -- +1 attack per ally

Expert Treasure Hunter (OtDS) -- limit 1 per hero

These can both be looked at power nerfs, especially for EBM.  ETH had been out for close to a year, EBM for over 20 months.

June 2014 Dunland Trap released

October 2014 Nin-in-Eleph released

FAQ 1.7 (1/20/2015)

Will of the West (Core) -- remove from game when used

O Elbereth Gilthoniel (Shadow and Flame) -- title fixed

A Watchful Peace (HoN) -- ??

Trained for War (Druadan Forest) -- ??

Blue Mountain Trader (Dunland Trap) -- limit once per round

Will of the West was part of an extreme combo and the change preserved the common case.  This was the first chance to fix Blue Mountain Trader, and the change preserved the common case.  I don't remember the original form for the other three, but I don't remember them generating discussion.

FAQ 1.8 (1/26/2016)

Horn of Gondor (Core) -- character destroyed instead of leaves play

Love of Tales (Long Dark) -- make exhaust, restricted

Both cards were part of an extreme combo, and Love of Tales preserved the common case.  Horn of Gondor changed *the common case* instead of exhausting and IMO a very poorly down errata.  Horn of Gondor had been out over four years.

FAQ 1.9 (10/16/2017)

Wandering Took (core) -- limit once per round

Boromir (Dead Marshes) -- ability limited to once per phase

Out of the Wild (Road to Rivendell) -- add to victory display

Hama (Long Dark) -- ability limited to three times per game for group

We Are Not Idle (Shadow and Flame) -- exhaust heroes instead of dwarves

Caldara (Blood of Gondor) -- ability limited to once per game

Wingfoot (Nin-in-Eleph) -- exhaust

Wandering Took, WANI, Out of the Wild, Wingfoot were all part of extreme combos, all changes preserved the common case except for WANI, which was dramatically weakened after over five years in wide use.

Hama was part of a combo with Thicket of Spears, which was errated over four years ago (with Feint) so that Hama could continue to use it without breaking multiplayer.  Hama had been out for over five years.

Caldara had been out for four years, but had more recently become popular because of a couple new cards (one specifically designed to work well with Caldara) and a favorable ruling.  It was a straight power nerf and changed her archtype.

Boromir had been out for almost six years and was very popular, and it was a straight power nerf.

FAQ 1.10 (2019)

A Burning Brand, Legacy of Durin, Erebor Battle Master, who knows what else.  Legacy of Durin has been involved in previous extreme combos, the other two not.

Poor Long Dark, receiving errata in five different FAQs.

It's true that you couldn't nerf "long-released cards" early in the game because nothing had been out long, but it's striking that *only* long-released cards are receiving errata.  Blue Mountain Trader appears to be the *only* card after 2013 to be fixed in the next available FAQ.  Beravor was errata-ed in the *first* FAQ that errata-ed player cards, that's not the same sort of thing that was done to Boromir.

Is it considered impolite to monopolize defense in a game with strangers?

Yes, I'd agree it would be impolite to risk unprotected defense in Road to Rivendell with four enemies engaged, since it has the single most powerful and obnoxious shadow in the game.  But in a pickup game, Beregond has enough readies to cover a Dunedain's deck 4 engaged enemies *plus* the other three players as well?  And a Dunedain deck of all decks would *welcome* Beregond's shadow-free defense because it would allow them to engage more enemies then they can handle on their own.

But suppose instead it's a Dale deck with 1-2 enemies engaged.  Is it "impolite" for him to use his Redwater Sentries for something other than questing or attacking for 1?  In most quests, he's just risking a Sentry, which isn't near the table impact of losing Beregond.  Even in Return to Rivendell returning an enemy or two to the staging area isn't going to kill the other three players, so if he has more fun risking death than watching you play, what's the problem?  When possible, I think it's preferable for *players* to come to an arrangement than it is for the *designers* to fix something the players are able, but unwilling, to do.

This logic would hold for player variants and optional rules.  A player who *chooses* to play a variant or an optional rule knows they are playing a variant, and is content with that choice.  Some enjoy variants, others prefer to "play by the rules"

Errata changes the rules -- now you have a player who *was* playing by the rules, and if they continue playing in the fashion they are *not* playing by the rules.  So while a player isn't "forced" to play a particular way, they are "forced" to change the way they play or not follow the rules.  When WANI is nerfed, my enjoyment is affected whether I play by the rules (in which case WANI may not make the cut), or whether I ignore the errata (in which case my win feels "tainted" if I used WANI to get to five dwarves quicker.)

You are also ignoring the cost in fracturing player base or affecting past discussion and decks -- this is also a cost to variants/optional rules, but it is especially acute with errata.

If "errata has at worst a neutral effect" you would not see errata-hating players in threads like these.

The Narvi's Belt errata was a sensible change to remove the interpretation that it could provide a Baggins Sphere Resource Icon.

Based on your post I think the only one of those cards that is 100% ruined for me is Master of Lore. I just cannot imagine a scenario where it would be worthwhile to include it in a deck.

For all of the others I would at least still consider including them in a deck, even Horn of Gondor, which was a happy realisation for me. I suppose it helps to not have spent many years using the cards the old way.

I'll give ABB a try with the new wording. I have a feeling that if it was printed this way originally it would have been pretty good still, we are just used to the extreme power level of the original printing.

For me, the last cycles (Dream Chaser, Harad and Rhovanion) are among the very best of this game, with a special mention to Mountain of Fire. Although it is a very tough end for the campaign, I have to admit the mechanics evoke perfectly the theme and tone of the books.

I'm pleased with the game design in general, and I'm especially pleased with how the latest cycle has synergized with lesser cards from past cycles.  If you squint hard, you can even now justify playing Power in the Earth and Beorning Beekeeper!

Agreed that it's still a powerful and useful card in the new form, though I'd be a lot happier if it hadn't had Restricted slapped on it.  With Silver Lamp out I don't think it will impede even 4-player super defenders much.

See my reply to GILLIES291. In summary, playing with original text against any scenario released before the errata should not really be considered "against the rules", since it was allowed at the time. It should only be considered against the rules for future content. But in that case, it is up to the individual to decide if they will get enjoyment out of it. If they decide to stop collecting more content and just play with what they have, then their enjoyment hasn't gone down.

And yes, I believe everyone in the thread saying that it still will. I am trying to help them reconsider. Just as a thought experiment, suppose the developers themselves came out and said "When playing progression style, feel free to use the original text of a card for quests released before that card's errata." If they said this, then would you agree with me that errata should cause no loss of enjoyment for anyone?

## 145 [GILLIES291 on May 14, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/294624-different-cards-with-the-new-reprint/?do=findComment&comment=3701748)

Errata by its very nature will often cause someone to lose enjoyment. It's changing the rules, dethroning common favourite cards, and presenting the option to either play with our own made up rules (which we see as the old and original way) or lose out on favorite heroes and key player cards. 

Sure I could use heroes other than Boromir, and I have. But he is my favourite hero and thematically raising your threat to try to help multiple times in a round was always great fun. Then when I found out he had been changed it dimminished and spoiled a lot of that fun. For those of us that want to play by the rules and updates, it's hard when thing we enjoy get the nerf bat. Especially when often it's because one player just made a super powerful combo and was abusing it and publicizing it. You can break a lot of heroes and cards in the current game with the right set ups. But now it almost makes you not want to publish powerful and interesting new decks for fear that your design will inspire a future errata. 

And it all boils back down to a cooperative versus a competitive game. Comepetive games needs it more because of large group events and LOTR is recently been straddling the line especially with the latest POD packs being versus ones. Which is why I think those events or scenarios would benefit from a banned list rather than physically altering the vast majority of everyone else's games and enjoyment.

So you can't please everyone and erratas targeting old cards, when most of us New players only have a few and older cards, really just ramps up the difficulty and hurts our gameplay. Yes I know you said we shouldn't feel bad playing by the old way, but we do. And newer players that buy a new pack will have no choice but to play vastly underpowered versions of those cards.

 

I can say that the Horn of Gondor errata made trying to play a pure tactics fellowship with just the core set that much harder. My first adventure pack I picked up was Dead Marshes to get Boromir and thankfully I didn't know about his errata and the version I have doesn't have those changes so I was able to enjoy the fighting chance he gave my tactics groups with the limited card pool against difficult scenarios. Same with Hama who was just being a fun option that is difficult to abuse going to "well he is pretty much garbage now, it's not like he could really do anything other than getting feint or eagle searching back". Caldera doesn't actually make sense for us to play even written the old way because we hardly have any high cost spirit allies, limiting her to once per game just made us laugh and put her in the will never play anytime soon pile. Which is unfortunate. So those three heroes are borderline unusable to us average new players unless you had tons of adventure packs and could try to build something still semi-good but limited and specific.

What do you mean with that? From the core set tactic cards this would only affect Beorn when you use his response and I highly doubt this one ressource you save over a game makes much of a difference. The only other card from the core set would be Sneak Attack which cannot be use in a pure tactics deck. And for chump blocking there is no difference in the function of the card.

There's also Gandalf in the core set that can trigger it, and when the tactics deck is in a fellowship the other deck might have Sneak Attack.

The real hit from the Horn change comes right away in the Mirkwood cycle when the Eagles come online -- they're expensive and they leave play by design.  Mirkwood also introduces Rohan's discard mechanic, if tactics is playing with spirit.  Progression style, Mirkwood was probably peak Horn of Gondor usefulness until Silvan becomes a thing.

The mechanic of Horn of Gondor does (and did) not represent the theme of the item as it is depicted in the books. In my opinion they missed a golden chance with tne errata to fix this.

But hey! Erebor battle master has been errated twice, so who knows!? We may be lucky and see a second errata of those cards that the first errata did a poor job 😂

I will answer your question marks as well as voice my opinion about some errata.

Thicket of Spears and Out of Sight used to be a multi-target Feint, they used to prevent all attacks from engaged enemies against any player. I wonder why Hobbit-sense has not gotten an errata yet as it also prevent enemies from attacking. Narvi's Belt could be used to generate Baggins ressources as rees263 already pointed out. Nori reduced your threat after a dwarf character entered play under your control. Combine this with Sneak Attack or A very good Tale und you got some crazy threat reduction. I am not familiar with the old combo of Master of Lore, so I cannot comment this card. Maybe you can explain it to me.

A Watchful peace allowed to bring a location back to the encounter deck that had victory points, potentially abusing some cards. Trained for War was changed so it could be used on quests that had key-words other than Siege like Dire or Defense. Blue Mountain Trader allowed free ressource trading between players (and heroes of different spheres) thus trivializing the planning phase. Imagine like A Good Harvest in ally form for all players.

Love of Tales is limited once per hero instead of restricted, but you surely meant that. Sure, you can no longer generate three ressourcs on a single hero when playing a song, most of which can be paid by any hero. I never tried this combo, so I cannot say, whether it was extreme or not.

I never had a problem with the Errata for Horn of Gondor, seeing as it was intended to fascilitate chump blocking. This way it would no longer combo with the silvan events, which it was not designed for as this was too powerful. Normally by chumping you sacrifice an ally to save a hero, silvan events only give you benefits from the event itself and replaying the returned ally. Seeing that most silvans only cost 2 ressources, HoG paid for half your cards already.
It also no longer synergizes with Sneak Attack, which used to be clearly intented by the developers (look at some older news, back when they still wrote other articles that just announcements), but in my opinion this is not bad. After all Boromir used his horn when he was in dire need and not because Legolas went scouting into the woods.

WANI was a power nerf, but a needed one, as generating a dozen ressources with a single card (and potential readying with Lure of Moria) is just plain overpowered. Traffic from Dale is a similar card, but at least it is limited to once per round and having allies with attachments is more difficult to achieve than spamming dwarves.

Háma and Thicket of Spears just trivialized combat for a single player, as you no longer needed to defend non-immune enemies. You just engaged everything and let them rot. I cannot say whether this was the best way to nerf the situation but at least it no longer restricted Caleb in the invention of new tactics events. Not even spirit can play a single event for the rest of the game.

I am fine with errata to Legacy of Durin and Erebor Battle Master. Five attack for a single ally (with Dáin) is enough, I see no justification why a dwarf should be able to one-hit everything in the game. Granted you need some work to achieve such a power level, but it is not as if you had to exhaust all other dwarves to use his ability or something. The nerf to Legacy is similar to the one of Nori.

Burning Brand again is one of those cards trivializing the game, which I should be fine with nerfing, though I will have to adjust my deck-building and approach on shadow effects. I wonder why Elrond or Warden of Healing have not received an errata.

Well, Gillie mentioned core set only, so Eagles and Rohirrim would not count, though I somehow forgot about Gandalf, who is similar to Beorn. And you might save maybe three ressources by playing Gandalf, while the Horn itself costs one. Sure, it is weakened, but not so much that I would complain about it.

Winged Guardian and Vassal of the Windlord cost two and one ressource respectively, not what I would call expensive. Of course I like paying to keep the Guardian around, but in this case the Horn will not trigger. And when I have Eagles of the Misty Mountains on the table, I pay one ressource for a chump or attack boost and then get a permanent boost to the Eagles. There is no need to generate an extra ressource on top of it.

Also neither Lore nor Spirit have ressource acceleration in the core set or Mirkwood cycle. Now spirit could really use some extra ressources when discarding all those Rohan allies, and Lore allies tend to become more expensive, but the Horn is a tactics card, where I do not see a need for extra ressources.

Winged Guardian is expensive *because* you have to keep feeding it.  I saved a lot of resources (progression) when I was able to replace Winged Guardian with Defender of Rammas.  Vassal is cheap but temporary.  And yes, it's nice when they go away and buff Eagles of the Misty Mountains (cost 4), and when you get down your Support of the Eagles (cost 3).  And you can also play Descendant of Thorondor (cost 4) and Landroval (cost 5).  But don't worry about those high costs, because ally Radagast (cost 5) will help you pay for it.

One of the reasons I was so excited about Radagast is his staff's cost reduction.  There's a reason that Mablung is in the stereotypical Eagles deck (Gwaihir edition).  They're about the least affordable tribe in existence.  But even without that, Tactics doesn't lack for expensive cards, like Citadel Plate and Beorn.  Yes, tactics needs resources.

And since mono tactics isn't viable until Heirs of Numenor (and even then only in Siege/Battle quests), Horn of Gondor certainly will have leadership/lore/spirit cards on the table.  The biggest problem with the original Horn of Gondor isn't its utility, it is its rarity -- only one in the core set.  It wasn't a reliable source of resources, but it was nice when it was present.

The big problem with the Horn of Gondor is that it didn't exhaust, that's the feature that let it be part of infinite card/resource combos.  And oddly, they decided to fix it by nerfing the *common* case but not requiring exhaustion.  Now even self-discarders don't generate a resource -- Boromir can sacrifice himself without the Horn giving a peep.

Dale hit it right on the head, tactics I would argue is the most resource-starved group in the game. And has some very expensive allies to pay for.

OK I have to object to this. While some cards may be rather dependent on the card pool you have available, that's the case whatever their errata status, so let's disregard that for the moment. The only errata'd card I might consider underpowered following its errata is Master of Lore, and even then not 'vastly' so. This is the thing that annoys me most when people start complaining about errata - a lot of the time they seem to only consider the card in relation to its pre-errata state rather than to other cards in the pool, the actually reasonable means of assessing whether something is over- or underpowered. Which again, they're not underpowered, certainly not vastly so.

As soon as you pay to keep Winged Guardian around, Horn of Gondor is not helping you and never did, so the errata changed nothing in that regard. If the Guardian is destroyed, you will still get the ressource. The only difference is, that you no longer get a ressource when you choose not to satisfy the forced effect, but in that case, why were you using the Guardian instead of a chump`? And Support of the Eagles even lets you use the Guardian like an attachment, so no extra cost for keeping him around at all.
Landroval is expensive, yes, but compared to Fate or Fortune, which costs the same with a similar effect, you also get a decent ally. I have already mentioned,

While Radagast himself is expensive, he also provides 2 willpower, which in that card pool is worth about 2 - 3 ressources, particularly in tactics, where Eagles of the Misty Mountains are the best, when it comes to questing with 2 willpower. If you want more willpower, use a different sphere. So you are paying 2 - 3 ressources for his ability, which is reasonable.

So there is your answer: if you need more tactics ressources, include Mablung. This might not work in a progression deck, that is why he was developed. And what do you think would happen, if you could get even more ressources besides Mablung's response? Games need to be balanced. Of course you are free to add Steward of Gondor and some other cards to enable playing it into a tactics deck.

I assume, you mean mono tactics solo one-handed. In that case SoG and Song of Kings will give you many ressources. And while there is only one Horn in the core set, the rules allow up to three in a single deck, so proxying would be a solution. Just assume your Power in the Earth is a stand in for the Horn, or copy it, or buy additional core sets.

I would rather get additional compensation for sacrificing several allies in the same turn, than making many Rohan allies free in conjunction with Théoden or getting free ressources out of The Tree People. For example:

At the beginning of the planning phase you have three ressources, one silvan ally in hand and O Lórien and Horn of Gondor in play. Reduce the cost to play an ally by 1 with O Lórien, pay a ressource, play the one ally and trigger his enter play effect. Use The Tree People to bring the ally back to your hand, the Horn generates a ressource (back at 3) and search for an ally in the top five cards in your deck, bring it into play and trigger its enter play effect. Pay 2 ressources to bring the original ally back into play and trigger its effect again. Congratulation: You now have paid 2 ressources for 2 allies and 3 enter play effects (e.g. reduce your threat by 2 and draw an event card). Throw in a Galadhrim Weaver to shuffle The Tree People back into your deck and then tell me, whether this combo is overpowered. Even if the Horn exhausted, like you want it to, you could repeat this combo for a couple turns. And then, when you or another player have to chump block, you no longer get a refund.
So your proposal enables some crazy shenanigans, while shooting yourself into the foot.

And besides: Boromir also did not use his Horn because some elves played Ring around the Rosie.

You are talking about a 5+ card combo which has almost nothing to do with Horn of Gondor. There are lots of ways to get extra resources. You could also just have Steward of Gondor in play, and get 2 more resources for free without having to pull any ally shenanigans. In what world is an exhausting Horn of Gondor broken but that isn't?

Most of my annoyance with errata would be erased if FFG simply made cheap POD update packs available so players could get the new physical version of the card.  Then it wouldn't be necessary to remember which cards should be played with which text (or try to explain to new/casual players why the old version of the card isn't actually played the way it's printed anymore)  -- you could simply just play the card as printed. Such packs would have to be cheap, however, because otherwise there would be a problematic monetary incentive to issue needless errata just to get players to buy the updates.

You might have understood me wrong. This was an example of what Horn of Gondor would do in its old incarnation, which I am clearly against. Here is the preceding sentence, in case you skipped it:

Horn of Gondor basically would make the ressource cost of Silvan events negative 1. Together with O Lórien and the usual events this would result in a free ally every round and two other effects, one from the event and one from the ally.

You wrote, "Even if the Horn exhausted, like you want it to, you could repeat this combo for a couple turns," which to me indicates that you think Horn of Gondor would be overpowered if they had just added "Exhaust to..." to its original text. Again I can't see how getting 1 extra conditional resource a turn could possibly be OP, given that there are plenty of other ways to do this, or even to get them unconditionally (Resourceful, Steward of Gondor). If getting > 3 resources per turn makes Silvan cards broken, the problem is not the resource generation.

Fatty, SpPippin, Bombur ally, and Lorefindel are all playable right now.

Bombur is actually very good in any quest that uses underground locations. Lorefindel is only seen as bad because of his spirit version.  I'm playing a saga campaign that has used lorefindel to good effect right now; we're up to passing of the grey company now.

Fatty is much better than people give him credit for -  the ability to adjust questing after cards a revealed is extremely powerful, and the modern card pool has enough threat reduction options that raising your threat is not the penalty it once was.

Pippin is still bad, but playable. I've for a mono spirit hobbit lineup that just quests past all the enemies in the staging area and does a pretty good job of it. He also pairs well with tactics Bilbo, letting you keep enemies in the staging area to kill.

Not going to bother to defend Brok, and the Orc- slayer can make a big impact, but probably costs one more resource than he should.

Fatty appears in 90 decks in ringsdb, Bombur in 81, SpPippin in 60. It is a fierce competition!

LoGlorfindel appears in 252 decks, less than Brok! Who appears in 296. Fore core set cards, this is a veeeedy low count. As a benchmark for comparison, Power in the Earth (core set), appears in 166 decks.

But hey! I agree, they are playable cards, just very bad ones given the current card pool, and they don’t recieve an errata. Notice that this argument is not that different from that that makes cards to recieve an errata “this card is too powerful given the current card pool”.

To me, if I would previously have used a card and now I will literally never include it in a deck, it has been nerfed too hard and saying it is now “vastly underpowered” seems reasonable (if not the specific words I would use). Master of Lore, Horn of Gondor, Hama, all fit into this category.

It’s different with the likes of Caldara and Boromir who had their power level reduced but are still very playable (they’re actually still powerful cards imo which shows the errata was probably needed). 

HoG specifically is such an iconic part of the books and (now) such a bad card. I never even include it in mono-tactics decks. And that makes me a bit sad.

1) You don't benefit from Horn of Gondor *when* you pay to retain a Winged Guardian after defense, but the resource you pay to retain a Winged Guardian could have been generated by Horn of Gondor.  For example, needing two defenses and lacking resources, you can let one Winged Guardian go and use that resource to retain the other -- or chump with a Vassal and pay the Winged Guardian with that.  And if you can't afford to keep a Winged Guardian, Horn of Gondor gets you an extra resource to help pay for a replacement next turn.

With the current Horn of Gondor, if you defend with Winged Guardian and intend to let it go (either because you're broke or trying to buff an Eagle of the Misty Mountain), you're actually hoping for a bad shadow to kill it outright.  I find that a bit peverse.

2) Yes, if you keep a Winged Guardian around just to use his 4 defense for Support of the Eagles, there's no additional cost -- but you need 5 resources to get that combo, and once you get Misty out (another 4 resources) you'll want that to be the buff target.  And you might need more defense than the Support of Eagles hero provides....

3) That Landroval is expensive (like other eagles) is the point of needing more resources.  Yes, Fortune or Fate is expensive too.  It's also a rarely-used sideboard card that was never popular outside of the brief heyday of pre-errata Caldara decks.

4) Yes, Radagast provides 2 willpower, and willpower doesn't come cheap in Tactics.  But as you point out, you don't use Tactics to provide willpower, so that hardly matters.  Radagast's role in an early Eagles deck was to help pay for Eagles, and to a lesser extent heal eagles (the two cheap Eagles are unhealable).  But with a 5 resource investment, he takes 5 turns to payoff, and that can be a hard sell.  In the solo-capable Gwaihir edition of the Stereotypical Eagles Deck, Radagast drops out completely.

5) What happens when you mix Horn of Gondor and Mablung?  That actually *is* the case in the Gwaihir edition (cost 5) of the Stereotypical Eagles Deck.  And you need all the help you can get, because the deck still has a lot of expensive cards.  Nor do I think it makes sense that a resource generator in Tactics should be nerfed just because another resource generator is subsequently introduced, especially when it's a hero -- heroes constrain deck design far more than cards in the deck.

Even with both generators, Eagles decks were among the least popular and least powerful archetypes in the modern card pool, though I think hero Radagast and his staff will give the trait a much-needed boost.

6) "Games need to be balanced".  In a cooperative game, neither decks nor cards *need* to be balanced, nor is it necessarily *desirable* that they be balanced.  Vilya decks are far more powerful than Eagles decks, and that's OK!  I've created and played a lot of Dori fellowships, nearly all of which would be more efficient if I subbed Beregond (either version) instead.  But that wouldn't make it more enjoyable to me, so I don't -- I specifically started the Dori fellowships because of his bad reputation as one of the worst heroes in the game.  Turns out he's actually fun and useful, just not in Beregond's class.  But that's NOT a reason to nerf Beregond!  It's not required that all hero defenders be "balanced", nor is it even desirable to do so.  It's not required that hero defense, ally defense, and chump defense be "balanced", nor (IMO) is it even desirable to do so.

7) Yes, I'm saying mono tactics isn't solo-viable until later in the history of the game (TaTheoden and *especially* TaEowyn).  That means that Tactics is either going to be in a deck with other spheres or at the table with other spheres.  Horn of Gondor was the only resource generation outside leadership for quite a while in the game's progression.  It's true that you can play Steward of Gondor without leadership with Song of Kings or (more likely) Good Harvest, but again there's no reason that the existence of one generator should make the other generator be nerfed, *especially* when in the common case SoG is much better -- not restricted, 2 resources per turn, grants Gondor, and can give you the resources when you usually need them, in the planning phase.

8 ) It's true that IF you are at the table with multiple chump-blocking players, Horn of Gondor is more powerful in its current state than if it had retained its original form (or even downgraded to discard) and exhausted.  But if your strategy isn't chump blocking, Horn of Gondor isn't going to be worth packing in its current form; the rare payoff isn't worth the deck space (and being Restricted doesn't help).

But if it exhausted, the common case would still be preserved while being totally unusable as part of an extreme card/resource loop.  And it could then be a reasonable resource generator from the beginning of the game, where resource generators are certainly needed.  Even if that generates a resource *every turn* in Silvan decks, so what?  One resource per turn from a unique, restricted item is not remotely game-breaking.  Nor is a single effectively free self-discarding 2-cost Rohan ally in a Rohan deck.  Silvan and Rohan decks aren't as powerful as Vilya decks, nor would they be if Horn of Gondor had a saner errata (most Silvan decks don't even use Tactics).

9) Boromir did not use his Horn because of disappearing Silvans.  But he also did not use it because one of his compatriats died.  He used it to *summon aid* and *intimidate the enemy*, both of which worked, just not quick enough to save him.  Rewarding players for characters *dying* (or disappearing) isn't actually a thematic fit for the actual Horn of Gondor.  I also note that Boromir bore a long sword, a shield, *and* the Horn, so the Restricted is also not a thematic fit for the actual Horn of Gondor.

> Thicket of Spears and Out of Sight used to be a multi-target Feint, they used to prevent all attacks from engaged enemies against any player. I wonder why Hobbit-sense has not gotten an errata yet as it also prevent enemies from attacking. Narvi's Belt could be used to generate Baggins ressources as rees263 already pointed out. Nori reduced your threat after a dwarf character entered play under your control. Combine this with Sneak Attack or A very good Tale und you got some crazy threat reduction. I am not familiar with the old combo of Master of Lore, so I cannot comment this card. Maybe you can explain it to me.

This was, I think, the first of the draw-your-deck combos.  It went like this:

Get Master of Lore, Legacy of Durin and Horn of Gondor in play.  Have Born Aloft in hand or top attachment in discard and Erebor Hammersmith in hand.

1) Master of Lore names allies, reducing allies cost to 1 (minimum of 1).

2) Play Erebor Hammersmith for 1 resource, draw a card, and get Born Aloft from discard if necessary.  Play Born Aloft on the Hammersmith.

3) Discard Born Aloft to return Hammersmith to hand, get your resource back.  Go back to step 2 (until your entire deck is drawn.)

Naturally, the designers in the wisdom broke the combo by nerfing poor Master of Lore, though he didn't make Hammersmith free.  They subsequently nerfed Horn of Gondor (adding exhaustion would've broken loop) after it showed up in another game-breaking loop -- though sadly, not by making it exhaust.  And now Legacy of Durin will be exhausting (which I prefer to the HoG fix) which at least preserves the common case.

Recursion and/or attachments that don't exhaust is at the heart of every extreme combo, both can be easily fixed while preserving the common case -- make the attachment exhaust (Love of Tales) or remove the event after playing (Will of the West).  I don't consider shadow protection an extreme combo, but if you do and consider it errata worthy making ABB exhaust is *certainly* the correct way to errata IMO.  (Adding the Restricted is just nerfing for the sake of nerfing, though.)

The main objection to Horn of Gondor errata isn't that it was done *at all*, but that it changed and weakened the common case.  Changing Horn of Gondor to exhaust could have, and should have been done to fix the Master of Lore loop instead of picking on the master, (and as was done with the Love of Tales loop).  Horn of Gondor was in yet another loop before its errata IIRC, as was inevitable when it didn't exhaust.

But you're overstating the effect for Rohan and Silvan.  Theoden can't make "many Rohan allies free" with HoG because he can only discount one ally per turn.  With Gamling you could make Escort from Edoras free every turn, but everything else would have to be paid for, and Gamling + Horn for effectively a 4-wp quester isn't outrageous.

The original Horn can do well with Tree People, but O Lorien only discounts one card per turn, and once you play Tree People it's in the discard.  Playing a Weaver gets it back in your deck, not your hand.  Now with ElvenKing and Galion you could make money off the original Horn, but only one per turn because Elvenking exhausts.  I'll agree Silvan shenanigans had potential for serious resource generation with the original Horn of Gondor (though most Silvan decks didn't use Tactics), but that could've been easily fixed with exhaustion.

That!

So, now that Erebor Battle Master has shown that a card can be errated twice (at least), may be we get a right version Horn of Gondor finally... :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

The only errata'd card I might consider underpowered following its errata is Master of Lore, and even then not 'vastly' so. This is the thing that annoys me most when people start complaining about errata - a lot of the time they seem to only consider the card in relation to its pre-errata state rather than to other cards in the pool, the actually reasonable means of assessing whether something is over- or underpowered. Which again, they're not underpowered, certainly not vastly so.

But I literally said: "And newer players that buy a new pack will have no choice but to play vastly underpowered versions of those cards"

For sure there are other cards out there, that are comparable to what the post errata cards are. But how many of the more senior players here had Boromir save their hides more than once by being able to ready more than a single time per phase? Or had the extra resources from Horn of Gondor to afford the key cards and pull off a win. Or just actually use Master of Lore in a deck? Hahaha. 

But seriously we are finishing a saga campaign right now and the two brand new players pairing up with my wife and I are using strong Dwarf decks with all of these recently errata-ed cards. And now my whole play group loses out on what was helping us scrape through with our limited card pool because people couldn't regulate their playing experience and FFG didn't want to create a restricted list for the rare competitive game nights that they have. 

These errated cards are vastly underpowered compared to their original incarnations. And in a competitive game I can see why there is a need for errata, in a cooperative game I can't. If you really wanted to break your game with the master of Lore loop then go on. Doesn't sound very fun to me. But it literally affects no one but the person playing it. Where errata-ing something every time a player finds a new combo is just silly to me as it only does the following:

-starts to complicate newer players getting into the game

-increase the difficulty for players like me that don't have the whole card pool to utilize on older scenerios that were balanced with those player cards

-add mental fatigue to keep track of changes to be playing "legit".

-take away strong combos for newer or less hardcore players that don't enjoy getting the floor wiped with their depowered heroes by Carn Dum and the like.

 

I think erratas are really just a lot of rubbish that don't have a place in a cooperative friendly game. At this rate are we going to rebalance every card in the game? I'm sure everyone can list off dozens of cards that could be toned down, so where does it stop? Vilya? Gandalf? Elrond? Warden of Healing? Steward of Gondor? Sword that was Broken? I could go on and on but the line must be drawn here! 

Nah we won't be following the errata anyways but it sure is annoying that people feel the need for errata because they can't regulate their own experience and the developers then have to create continuous errata.

Such an easy fix that would end all this errata discussion and avoid this pro- vs against erratas factions.

The new errata incoming to Legacy of Durin and Erebor Battle Master at least preserve the common case; WANI changed functionality, imposing a cap would've been much friendlier.  Dwarf decks are the first power deck to come online in progression play, so nerfing its power level has disproportionate impact on new players (to the extent new players can play progression, always iffy given the reprint schedule).

This reminds me of something I've been wondering: I did progression play myself when getting into the game, and loved it. And it still gets discussed quite a bit.

But how many people these days actually do it? Anecdotally in my area, at least, literally all the players who have an interest in the game (who do not have the entire pool) have a smattering of products spread out quite a bit in time, usually including the latest cycle, or sometimes a cycle like Dream-chaser that is slightly less recent but still relatively "modern".

Caleb has remarked several times about designing the player cards of Wilds and the Ered Mithrin cycle to be a good addition to the Core right away for new players. I wonder if he really thinks much about progression play at all; or whether he perceives that the state of reprints, the overwhelming size of the pool, etc. means that progression play is pretty unrealistic for the vast majority of players. His mental mode may be that people tend to buy more recent stuff, then backfill when they have the opportunity.

Or maybe I'm off base here. What do people think?

I think you're probably right, although I'm speaking from assumptions rather than data. It's 3 or 4 years since I obtained the whole card pool and started buying expansions as they were released, but before that I would pick up packs almost completely based off of what could be got for a good bargain at the moment. I never had any interest in progression style, but even if I had I think that combination of availability + economics would have won out. And that was during a time of relative plenty in terms of reprints.

I was pleased on behalf of new players that the Wilds of Rhovanian had a thematic, formidable archetype right out of the box. I suspect Caleb is very sensitive to the fact that (from what I've seen) most stores, if they keep physical stock of the game at all, typically have the Core Set and at most one or two of the most recent releases. I doubt many newer players have progression play on their minds.

There must be some scenario-specific reason why Watchful Peace bringing back VP locations is problematic, because for the most part VP locations are obnoxious beasties you don't want to see again.  I took a brief look at VP locations and nothing jumped out of me.  Overall the errata preserves the common case, and it's a rarely used sideboard card in any case.

Did the original wording of Trained for War exclude keywords, making it a rare positive errata?

Blue Mountain Trader's errata was expected as soon as the card came out, and came in the form people expected, preserving a common case.  BMT didn't allow free redistribution between players (a maximum net transfer of one no matter how many exchanges were made), but within each player was equivalent of a solo Errand Rider that didn't exhaust.  I don't the effect was game-breaking (unlike Good Harvest, it couldn't be used to play a sphere you didn't have), and more importantly it required *cooperation* to work, so it could not affect anyone who didn't wish to be affected.  But all the same, the form of the errata was well done.  This was also a card that was errata-ed at the first opportunity after printing, I'm much more sympathetic to those ("Whoops, we didn't mean to do that") than to errata of long-standing cards--I think it's quite possible that the designers didn't realize its potential int he first place.

The key change for Love of Tales wasn't the 1 per hero (that's limiting, but since it's not unique you can still have multiple copies in play), but the exhaustion -- that nerfed the card/resource loop by restricting the resources.  Really, *any* attachment that generates resources and doesn't exhaust (or have a hard per round limit) is just waiting for the right combination to break the game.  This was not a surprise nerf, but the limit 1 per hero was not necessary after exhaustion was added.  Post-nerf it's returned to obscurity, though it at least is a reliable (and free) generator in a song-heavy deck.  It's a shame that the lesson about exhaustion wasn't followed for Horn of Gondor.

Original WANI in conjunction with Lure of Moria works out to a net resource gain if you have more than 3 dwarves, and are willing to burn the powerful Lure of Moria event (or can easily recur it).  WANI/Lure of Moria/Legacy of Durin could be used for a draw-your-deck loop, so some limitation on WANI and/or Legacy of Durin makes sense -- but aside from the novelty value, if you can make a massive amount of money because you have a massive amount of dwarves on the table, you *already* are in a winning place and are just doing "win more".  My grief against the WANI errata isn't that it was limited, but that it was *changed* to be a much less useful card -- the common case was not preserved.  Put "limit 3" on it instead and it can still be used to help you get five dwarves out quickly.

The original errata to Thicket of Spears shows clearly that the designers had no problem with Hama "trivializing combat" for a single player.  The larger problem is that thanks to Mablung and TaAragorn, Hama-deck could steal other players' enemies as well and trivialize combat for *multiple* player.  The problem with the errata is that it doesn't preserve the common case -- rather than focusing on preventing the recursion of powerful cards, it incents Hama to *only* recur powerful cards by giving him a per-game limit.  Sending Thicket of Spears to the victory pile, or turning a Hama-recurred cards into an attachment which is removed or bottom-decked after play would've limited recursion of *specific* cards while still allowing Hama to do what he was designed to do.  As it is, the nerf pretends that while Hama playing Thicket of Spears every turn cannot be born, even at the cost of using the only card drawn and all of the resources generated, playing Thicket of Spears nine times is just fine (3x + 3 Hama + 3 tome).  I don't think the design space opened by allowing nine plays (or more in combination with other cards) but not every turn actually exists.  Honestly, if there's an event that's problematic in *any* sphere to recur repeatedly, it needs to go to the victory display after playing.

Tactics Gimli takes issue with your claim that one dwarf should not be able to one-shot everything.  The nerf to EBM capping at five preserves the common case, but strikes me as unnecessary -- if you have an obscene number of dwarves to generate obscene EBM attack values, you probably don't *need* EBM for obscene attack values.  It's preventing a win-more that was fun, but pointless.  At least EBM's cap doesn't leave him inferior to a same-cost card, like poor Leaflock.  More concerning to me is that with the change to EBM *and* Legacy of Durin on the heels of the WANI nerf, there's the appearance of a concerted effort to nerf dwarf decks in particular, as if there weren't other archtypes just as powerful or even more powerful.  Since dwarf deck is the first power deck progression-style, this hits new progression players hardest and I don't see that as a good thing.

The most powerful archtype is Vilya, but I don't see nerfing Vilya as either necessary or desirable.  A limit could be reasonably placed on the number of times Warden of Healing could be used per turn without impacting the common case, but I don't think the efficient healing provided by Elrond/Warden is a problem that needs fixed.

That's totally fair. I have a freakishly good memory for errata/rulings/card text, but for people who don't obviously it would be less frustrating if they could rely on their card text being correct.

Since it doesn't exist, you have nothing to worry about. Even if it did exist, you wouldn't need to buy it, but other people would like to.

And yes, it could be nice if they were to give positive errata on underpowered cards as well as negative on overpowered. In many cases cards are rehabilitated instead by their combination with later-released cards, but not all.

I disagree. I personally will probably never play Caldara again, but that's not because she's vastly underpowered now, just because I no longer find her interesting. So lack of interest in playing a card is not necessarily down to power level, rather to playstyle. I have used Master of Lore and Horn of Gondor since the errata, and I still feel Hama is at least worthy of consideration. I don't think they're vastly underpowered. They just suit certain kinds of decks.

I can appreciate the desire for Horn of Gondor to be more *universal* given its book significance, but divorced from that context, it's not a *bad* card, it's just a card suited to a particular type of deck and which really shouldn't have the Restricted keyword that it does.

Yes. I read what you said, and responded to it. The post-errata versions of those cards are not vastly underpowered. Underpowered is measured in the general context of the game, not the errata history of a specific card. Many cards in their post-errata forms, while less powerful than they were pre-errata, are still noticeably *more* powerful than other comparable cards in the pool. They are most certainly not vastly underpowered.

I've never played Master of Lore in a deck, though I do have a deck I haven't played yet with 3x, just for fun.  I never had the original version.  I have used Horn of Gondor, but I don't remember if a non-destroyed resource generation was actually critical.  I'm sure multiple readies have saved my bacon in the few TaBoromir decks I've played, and I'm absolutely positive I beat Carn Dum on the strength of multiple shadow cancellation with ABB.  Those wins feel a bit tainted post-errata, since I could not have won them without the benefit of an "error" by the designers.

Thanks to the Limited Edition, I now have Horn of Gondor with two different wordings, I can't include 3x Horn of Gondor (in the unlikely case that I'd want to) without differing text.  Nori, Feint, and Blue Mountain Trader are the other errataed cards in the Starter, but I have the errataed versions of Nori and Feint already, and BMT came as a 3x.

Master of Lore is certainly underpowered compared to other cost reducers -- it costs the most despite being (like others) limited to discounting one card and (unlike some others) prohibited from reducing cost below one.

I think we are just disagreeing on the comparison or perhaps definition of vastly underpowered. I'm comparing that card to that card as for newer players we don't have the whole card pool so we are limited to resource generation from things like Horn of Gondor and the like initially. You are comparing it to the pool as a whole. I stand by that Horn of Gondor is vastly underpowered compared to original Horn of Gondor. Likewise with the new versions compared with the original versions of Boromir, Hama, Caldara, and the other erratas. So if one only has the dead Marshes as a first expansion, then Horn of Gondor and Boromir for example are vastly underpowered compared to what they would have been for a new player. But power levels are subject to persona opinion so we can agree to disagree.

 

I definitely played somewhat progression style as we were getting started. Picking up the first cycle and playing through that with just those cards. We diverged to pick up and play through the Sagas but we have been fortunate to get things in order so far.

Black Rides has some friendly VP locations like Bag End, Woody End, Bamfurlong, Midgewater, The Troll's Camp etc. Returning those cards for the next staging step would make the game easier. And there is no thematic reason, Frodo should return to Bag End or any of the other locations several times in a row, when his goal is to reach Rivendell as soon as possible.

I might have worded my sentence ambiguosly, so I will try again: Blue Mountain Trader does not allow you to give your partner an arbitrary amount of ressources, you are right. But it allowed you to trade your tactics ressources into spirit ressources (when the trader returns back to you) and your partner could turn his leadership ressources into lore ones. This is the equivalent of having all songs of all spheres you control on all your heroes.

You are right, I remembered the errata wrong. Still, what would several copies of Love of Tales mean on a single hero? That he love songs even more than another hero? Thematicly I cannot see a justification. When you already use songs, most ressources can be spent as fit anyway, at least for playing cards, so you could just as well spread the Love for Tales over all your heroes (by making them lore beforehand).

I am not sure, I can follow you. If you want five dwarves, you already have at least Thorin and Ori in play, and probably also a third dwarven hero. With two dwarven allies, or one ally and Bombur hero, you have already reached the magical number of five dwarves. So this only leaves the case of a single dwarven ally, so you are missing out on a single ressource. Granted, this might make a difference, but not as severe as you made it sound.

Well, Gimli needs a lot of attachment to one-shot the Balrog or Smaug. Nevertheless, Gimli is a hero and thus unique, the Battle Master is not. You could nearly see it equivalent to a Battle Master giving +1 Attack to every dwarf ally you control, only concentrated on a single ally. Some say, Dáin is overpowered...

If you consider Leaflock in a poor shape, then what about Denethor? I am not concerned about nerfs to power decks. We still do not know, what Caleb is planning and what might be nerfed next time. He surely is not errataing cards out of boredom.

Tolkien describes Vilya as "the mightiest of the Three", thus second only to the One Ring. A powerful artifact justifies a powerful.

It might have weakened the common case, but I do not see a need to make events like Sneak Attack for free, which is already powerful enough with Gandalf. On the other hand, chump blocking several attacks weakens your board state and Horn of Gondor helps you rebuild it.

When you say, I am overstating the effect for Rohan and Silvan, this only leaves some events and Eagles (or is there another theme I am forgetting?). In my opinion Eagles are strong enough and buffing Eagles of the Misty Mountains is enough reward, there is no need to earn a ressource, as I already said before.

I did not mean many as in "many per turn", rather as in "more than just Snowbourn Scout, Escort from Edoras and the Riddermark's Finest". But Gamling, Horn, Théoden and Riddermark's Finest would allow you to put 4 progress per round for a single ressource, or 2 progress for free. It is said, with the existence of Asfaloth the number of progress needed to clear a location has been increased to at least three. The combination above would be a bit more work and if you are willing to pay something extra even more effective. And guess what happens, when you would use Grimbold instead of the Riddermark's Finest. Hint: Háma + Feint pales in comparison.

I am aware of how O Lórien, The Tree People and Galadhrim Weaver work, thanks, and my example reflected that. But the point is, that the Horn would make one Silvan ally per turn free with O Lórien and one of the events. Of course you could argue that Heir of Valandil also makes an ally free per turn, but being engaged with three or more enemies is riskier. And King of Dale needs a lot of card draw, as Dale allies without their proper attachments are weak.

A Silvan solo deck might usually not use tactics, but someone else could.

As I said, buffing a Eagles of the Misty Mountains is already reward enough. I prefer my Winged Guardians alive, as they have something the Eagles or a Defender of Rammas have not: Sentinel. Anecdotal side note: This year at the Lure of Middle-earth, someone at my table had a mono tactics deck and pondered whether he should pay for the Guardian or let it buff the Eagles. I asked him to pay because of Sentinel, which saved our lives.

And when I chump with a Vassal I will get my ressource with the current Horn of Gondor, so I am not sure, what you wanted to say with that part. And if I cannot afford to keep my Guardian, I will chump with another ally anyway to get my ressource and not have to pay for a replacement.

> Quote
> 
> 2) Yes, if you keep a Winged Guardian around just to use his 4 defense for Support of the Eagles, there's no additional cost -- but you need 5 resources to get that combo, and once you get Misty out (another 4 resources) you'll want that to be the buff target.  And you might need more defense than the Support of Eagles hero provides....

A Winged Guardian defends once per round, a supported hero can do so several times (Boromir, Unexpeted Courage). It takes two discarded eagles to get the Eagles to four defence, and then you still have only one defence without sentinel.

When Fortune or Fate is a sideboard, then Landroval is as well. If I do not plan on having a hero killed, I would rather play something cheaper like a Veteran Axehand.

> 4) Yes, Radagast provides 2 willpower, and willpower doesn't come cheap in Tactics.  But as you point out, you don't use Tactics to provide willpower, so that hardly matters.  Radagast's role in an early Eagles deck was to help pay for Eagles, and to a lesser extent heal eagles (the two cheap Eagles are unhealable).  But with a 5 resource investment, he takes 5 turns to payoff, and that can be a hard sell.  In the solo-capable Gwaihir edition of the Stereotypical Eagles Deck, Radagast drops out completely.

First you say "don't worry, Radagast will help you pay", now you say that he can be a hard sell. And he does not take 5 turns to pay off, as 3 ressources are already paid for the willpower, which leaves 2 turns.

> 
> Even with both generators, Eagles decks were among the least popular and least powerful archetypes in the modern card pool, though I think hero Radagast and his staff will give the trait a much-needed boost.

13 cards in the deck cost 1 ressources, 15 cost 2, 5 cost 3, 10 cost 4 and 3 cost 5 ressources. This makes on average less than 2.5 ressources per card, which is less than you generate per round (up to 4 without the Horn). And I would not even waste my money on Landroval or Descendant in most cases.

> 6) "Games need to be balanced".  In a cooperative game, neither decks nor cards *need* to be balanced, nor is it necessarily *desirable* that they be balanced.  Vilya decks are far more powerful than Eagles decks, and that's OK!  I've created and played a lot of Dori fellowships, nearly all of which would be more efficient if I subbed Beregond (either version) instead.  But that wouldn't make it more enjoyable to me, so I don't -- I specifically started the Dori fellowships because of his bad reputation as one of the worst heroes in the game.  Turns out he's actually fun and useful, just not in Beregond's class.  But that's NOT a reason to nerf Beregond!  It's not required that all hero defenders be "balanced", nor is it even desirable to do so.  It's not required that hero defense, ally defense, and chump defense be "balanced", nor (IMO) is it even desirable to do so.

You keep saying this is a cooperative game, when the designers introduced competitive scenarios to the game. And if memory serves, you were the one to start the solo league which is competitive by design, even though restricted in deck building. I am not denying that Vilya or Beregond is more powerful than eagles or Dori respectively. But the game has a certain economy with ressources and card draw versus the encounter deck. If you hand out too much of them, the game becomes too easy.

There is a reason, as I said above: game economics.

But in that case the Horn should generate a ressource when an enemy is revealed or engaged (which is already done by Mablung). You are right, that Restricted makes no sense on the Horn, as the only other restriced ressource generators are Sword of Númenor and Orcrist, both require killing an enemy.

But I was thinking of his unlimited healing bonus, which doubles the effect of the Warden of Healing. You say a limit is reasonable, but not needed. Sounds paradox to me. Regardless, I will disagree on this point.

1) Yes, I can see where recycling Bag End would be very profitable, between zero threat, card draw, and stalling in stage one.  Of course, the designers could've made recycling Bag End less attractive for recycling by giving it high threat, since it starts as the active location.  It's not immune, so you can still swap it out and stall on stage one as long as you like.

Thematically, Frodo could return to Bag End for any reason he likes -- he is not, at this point, intent on reaching Rivendell ASAP and he is still hoping that Gandalf will show up before he leaves the shire.  He delayed leaving Bag End as long as possible and in fact left Bag End before returning for his final departure (that's when he overheard the Gaffer-half of the conversation with a Black Rider).  Stalling on stage one and putting off leaving Bag End as long as possible would be *highly thematic* -- but I'll grant that exploring Bag End a few times would make the scenario much easier.

2) I'm not sure why you're still trying to reword the effect of BMT.  It's unlimited resource redistribution within a player's heroes.  This is not the same as Good Harvest, and it's also not exactly the same as having Songs of each sphere you control on each hero.  For some cards/heroes, it matters *which* hero has the resources, and how many.  The equivalent would be an Errand-Rider in solo play who doesn't exhaust for his action.

3) If you must have a thematic justification for the existence of multiple non-tangible attachments on the same character, I don't see what's wrong with someone loving Tales twice as much as someone else who also loves Tales.  Sam probably fits that description well.  Similarly, I don't think there's anything wrong with one hero having more Unexpected Courage than another hero -- Sam also fits that description well.  I regretfully acknowledge that it's probably a good idea to break unlimited resource/card loops and that means resource-generating attachments *should* exhaust -- but I don't think there's any reason to go on to further nerf those cards based on arguable thematic arguments, especially when the card (like Love of Tales) isn't especially powerful in the common case anyway.

4) Five dwarves isn't useful just for Thorin, Ori, and to a lesser extent Oin, it's also useful for a number of allies.  But let's take a hypothetical case with both Thorin and Ori -- Thorin/Ori/Nori, tri-sphere deck, want to get to 5 ASAP.  There's two 1-cost allies (Sellsword and Record-Keeper), one of which will go away if you can't pay to keep them.  There's a lot of potential 2-cost dwarves.  In this case, the ability to use a 1-cost ally for WANI makes a huge difference on whether you can quest/fight and still have five dwarves at the beginning of the next round for Thorin and Ori.  I've used WANI to exhaust *only* a single Record-Keeper so I can get Zigil Miner out for my five, leaving all heroes ready.  That's not possible anymore, but it's worth burning WANI just to setup quickly on the most important turn -- the first.  Yes, when I get a huge swarm of dwarves out I can use WANI for huge piles of resources, but who cares?  If I've got a huge swarm of dwarves, I don't *need* lots of resources, I'm already in control.  WANI's top end is win-more.  It's using WANI for 1-2 allies at the beginning of the game that made the most difference, and that option is gone even though it wasn't overpowered.

5) Some do say that Dain is overpowered, though LeBoromir with Visionary Leadership does the same thing for Gondor.  So what?  If EBM is hitting for ten, you've still got ten dwarf allies and are very likely already in complete control.  EBM only gets ridiculous when the outcome isn't in doubt.  And when the outcome *isn't* in doubt, EBM isn't that powerful.  That's why I think the EBM errata isn't necessary, even though the errata also doesn't do much harm for the same reason.

6) Yes, Denethor (ally) is also a lame card.  Some people regret cards they consider overpowered -- I regret cards that are too weak.  I don't know what Caleb has in mind, but errata that purely affects power level can make a playable card unplayable if nerfed too hard, while errata enhancing weak cards impacts practically no one attached to the current version while actually expanding the effective card pool.  I think it's more elegant (and avoids the cost/annoyance of errata) to get new cards that synergize with old bad cards, but the few positive errata that have been made were uncontroversial and welcome.

7) *If* you were going to limit Warden of Healing, putting a limit on the readies would be the most reasonable errata -- it preserves the common case, while restricting a rare case (e.g. paying repeatedly for Gloin's healing so that he can take any number of undefended attacks -- with Elrond at the table and Song of Wisdom or Narvi's Belt on Gloin he can pay for his healing completely with Elrond + Warden of Healing, as long as he has sufficient hp).  Does that edge case justify errata to Warden of Healing?  It takes some setup, but can match Super Beregond *without* needing readies, and has the potential to monopolize defense in a pickup game.  If it were deemed obnoxious enough to errata, restricting the ready on the Warden would be the least obnoxious way to do it IMO.  But in no way do I consider the amazing efficiency of Elrond + Warden of Healing (the common case) to be a problem that requires fixing the *common* case.

I'm still confused as to why you think you need to adhere to the absolute latest errata when the final saga box game out 2 years ago. If you were playing through the campaign when it was released, you could have used these cards in their original form to achieve 100% legitimate wins. Many players did so, and their wins have not been invalidated by the errata.

> 3 hours ago, dalestephenson said:
> 
> Those wins feel a bit tainted post-errata, since I could not have won them without the benefit of an "error" by the designers.

In 2015, the Netrunner card Wireless Net Pavilion received an errata making it unique, shortly after it was used as a key piece in the world champion's winning decklist. Should the champion have given up his trophy and title after seeing the errata? Of course not. Errata does not invalidate past wins in any way, shape, or form, nor does it "taint" them. Every other player at the tournament had a completely equal opportunity to use the card.

The same goes for a co-operative game. Past wins are wins. And if you want to rewind the clock and play old quests with a concurrent card pool, it's completely fair to rewind the clock on errata as well.

I mean, just imagine this contrived thought experiment where they print a hero with the following text:

> Quote
> 
> Response: After a 'when revealed' effect is cancelled, add 1 resource to a hero's resource pool and return the top card of your discard pile to your hand.

An interesting effect in isolation, but obviously a completely broken ability in the same card pool as a Test of Will. So upon seeing players abusing this combo, they decide to errata Test of Will to cost 2 resources and remove itself from the game after use.

Now, would you feel like virtually every win in which you used Test of Will had suddenly been invalidated? I daresay you would not. The card only received an errata due to the potential abuse with a card that just got released. But you don't even own that card yet.

Of course, content going forward would start being designed around this new Test of Will, so it would make sense to follow that errata with new products. But it makes no sense to hold hostage all your past wins to the uncertainty of future game developments.

That's the factor that makes the errata neutral -- everyone had an equal opportunity to use the card in question.  If the game was asymetrical (wargames, for example, are usually asymetrical and often get post-release errata) or cooperative the errata is not neutral -- the errata is saying that the previous situation was not properly balanced and was in fact in error.  And that does, subjectively, make me feel like my wins are tainted when errata is against me or that my losses were unfair when they are for me.  Anyone who lost Into Ithilien due to a Blocking Warg loop is *entirely* justified in considering those losses unfair.

The Battle of Carn Dum didn't have the same opportunity I did to nerf my ABB as I had to nerf its plentiful and obnoxious shadows.  Thaurdir is *entirely* justified in considering those victories of mine tainted by my abuse of a card so unbalanced and powerful that the designers chose to nerf it in two different ways.

The fact that they chose to fix the combo *by errata to A Test of Will* shows that they *don't* think the only problem with AToW was the combo with the brand new hero -- otherwise they would've done the more logical and far less intrusive step of errata to the new hero.

Further, it's not just "content going forward" that would be affected.  Reprints of the *core set* would have the new AToW in them, significantly less useful than the new one.  It would not be just new content, but even Passage from Mirkwood that would be affected by the change.

ABB comes in a pack with the fifth quest ever published.  I don't think it's a stretch to say that *going forward*, the designers expect those playing against Conflict at the Carrock to use the errata-ed ABB and no other.  I think it is a stretch to say that quests 1-4 and 6-whatever-we're-at-now, unlike Conflict at the Carrock, are still meant to be played with the old ABB.

Many players did so, and their wins have not been invalidated by the errata.

It may be easy for you to say that and we will keep playing the old way because I won't tell the more casual players about the errata. It does make my wife and I feel bad and annoyed because as dale points out it's like the developers have stated "oh this card is too strong, even in its progression style, because they altered the cards in the packs that contain it. This is how the card should have always been." A new player that picks up burning brand and eventually progresses to Carn Dum is going to have a **** of a time trying to win against that scenerio without it being the old way. And why would someone want to make up different rules for their new card as it's printed? How would casual players even know they have the option to change the text on their cards to something more favorable that used to be? And would they want too? Or would it feel to much like cheating? 

 

We experienced this in Star Wars Imperial Assault where on the second mission I was controlling the Imeprials and the Rebels could not get through this locked and reinforced door. They were attacking it with everything they had and could at most do 1-2 damage against it a round. They lost utterly. I was so perplexed as to why it was such a hard mission for them and then after looking into it later I discovered that they had errata-ed and toned down these rebel saboteur characters to no longer be able to pierce through the doors defenses. They had done it for the competitive scene and it worked for that. But for the mostly cooperative game it imbalances it to the point of being actually near impossible to achieve, and completely impossible if this specific mission was randomly selected as the second mission. There was no guide saying "oh by the way this is what this card used to say, feel free to change it for this mission" anywhere.

Back to LOTR: It took me many many many tries to beat Carn Dum and a sentinel multi-readying Song of Wisdom Burning Brand Boromir is what finally helped us get through it. And even then it was still not easy. Now officially those things are no longer allowed. And for newer players with the new text on Boromir and Burning Brand... God help them against that scenario when they get there progression-wise.

 

Yes I'm sure you or someone else will say you can build another tailored perfectly tuned deck to take on a particular scenario, but that's not fun for us. Part of the enjoyment of this fantastic game comes from playing who we want to and with whatever decks we want. We can control our own difficulty levels and can help balance out some of the much weaker hero choices through strong "OP" cards like Burning brand. And if that's too much for other players due to the rare competive versus events then add a restricted list to that rules set. That would be far far more easier then buggering up everyone else's game, taking away fun combos to help out newer or less hardcore players, and not adding mental fatigue to an already heavy game.

Seriously how clean would a simple "When constructing fellowships for competive mode, the following cards are not allowed to be chosen/have the following restrictions/have their cost increased by # : boom insert list here"

That way you guys going to play the competitive event could have the upgraded challenge but you wouldn't make my more casual group forced to make a choice between following the rules or feeling bad because we are making up our own rules and trying to justify it.

I still think this sort of issue is more about Carn Dum itself rather than any errata. The community has generally been fine with saying "Skip Escape from Dol Guldur solo until you've got a lot more cards than the core"; maybe we should also go ahead and say "Skip Carn Dum unless you're ready for NM-level challenge. It's way up on the difficulty bell curve, no shame."

True, it can. Fortunately no errata released for this game has done so, and I think we can be pretty confident Caleb does not intend for any future errata to do so.

Also, re: your WANI/Record-keeper example, if you exhaust Nori or Ori instead you only lose out on 1 willpower and still get your 5 Dwarves. I'd do it.

"Unplayable" is in the eye of the beholder, of course.  Master of Lore is an unpopular card, and in its original form would be a fairly popular card IMO.

You are correct that exhausting Nori in my specific example could help you get to five with little loss; Nori is almost certainly questing on turn 1, which is all Erebor Record Keeper can do if you're out of resources, and in that case it's just a loss of 1 willpower.  Thorin/Dain/X with two Dwarven Sellswords would be different, but rare.  My general point is that I've found WANI most impactful *early* when used for 1-2 resources, not late with a full-fledged swarm already on the table, and depending on which dwarf heroes you have in use that may be problematic.

My last deck using WANI built before errata was a Return to Mirkwood fellowship (using all the cards in that pack) with Theodred/Dain/Nori as the dwarf deck -- that can't get to 5 dwarves on turn one, but with 6 1-cost and 6 2-cost dwarves helped me get to five dwarves.  Using WANI in the planning phase in its current form isn't nearly as compelling, since Dain needs to be ready to buff dwarves, and Nori needs to quest if I want Theodred to give him a resource.  Had I built the same deck today, I don't think WANI makes the cut.

No, the ABB errata is not saying that the original design was an error. I would break errata into two categories:

1. Errata that are released at the earliest opportunity. This applies to Blocking Wargs or Zigil Miner. The immediate rewrite of the card does suggest that the card's design was an error that snuck through playtesting. In this case, I would consider loses against Blocking Wargs and wins with broken Zigil Miner to be tainted.

2. Errata that come years after the release of the card. In this case it makes a lot more sense to assume that the card's design was fine at release, but became overpowered/broken by recent developments in the card pool.

If it's not clear, I'm using a single hero in my example, but in the case of ABB it's not one single modern card that makes ABB problematic. It's the plethora of readying effects in general. The "logical and far less intrusive step" is definitely not to errata all readying effects around ABB.

> 
> ABB comes in a pack with the fifth quest ever published.  I don't think it's a stretch to say that *going forward*, the designers expect those playing against Conflict at the Carrock to use the errata-ed ABB and no other.  I think it is a stretch to say that quests 1-4 and 6-whatever-we're-at-now, unlike Conflict at the Carrock, are still meant to be played with the old ABB.

As I said before, it's a worse NPE (negative player experience) for a new player to find out their wins against new content are invalid because they are not using the updated text, than to find out they've been playing a weaker version of a card against older scenarios. This is why errata must be included in reprints.

See above. The developers are not saying that. Look at Wandering Took, from the Core Set, which received an errata limiting it to once per round. The idea that his ability was too strong in progression style is laughable. I don't know if anyone even used his ability when we only had the core set available. The errata was obviously done to squash combos that developed later in the card pool.

In fact, it's a pretty low blow to the designer's intelligence to say that the card has been too strong from the beginning and they only just realized now.

To repeat what I said above, reprinting a card with new text is not necessarily an admission that the original design was wrong, or that any win with the old text are invalid. It is needed so that new players that buy that pack have the correct version of the card for modern content.

It seems like there's an inordinate amount of concern for Carn Dum in this thread. I never heard from the wave of new players that were unable to solo Shadow and Flame without Hama, or Three Trials without Boromir. If a new player is really hitting a wall beating Carn Dum without ABB, they will either skip it, like they probably did with Dol Guldur, or simply look online at one of the many published decks that have beaten Carn Dum without ABB.

I would break player card errata into four categories:

1. Errata that are released at the earliest opportunity.  These are presumably errors that snuck through playtesting.

2. Errata that are released at the first opportunity after a quest or quests is released, because of a specific interaction seen with a player card and the mechanics/cards of that release.  Whether the interaction was forseen or not discovered until after release, it was deemed better to change the player card rather than call out the interaction in the quest-specific rules.

3. Errata that are released to break a specific player card combination, in the first FAQ after that combination is discovered/publicized.  These are presumably fixing something broken, but the newly discovered combo may or may not involve any newly released cards.

4. Errata that are released well after the original card without an obvious broken combination -- power nerfs presumably prompted either by increased strength in a larger pool or by a change in designer attitudes -- if memory serves, most of the errataed cards were not originally released by Caleb.

It's a bit of a judgement call where these lie -- was Beravor/Protector of Lorien nerfed in FAQ 1.3 because it was the first FAQ to actually use errata, because Beravor + 3x-per-player UC + Protector of Lorien generated massive willpower, or just as a power nerf?  I'll leave those two out of the list, and A Elbereth Gilthoniel because I'm not sure of the context, but here's where the others would fit IMO :

1: Zigil Miner, Nori, Thror's Map, Master of Lore [combo piece], Ravens of the Mountains,  Blue Mountain Trader

2: Feint, Thicket of Spears, Narvi's Belt , A Watchful Peace, Trained for War

3: Will of the West, Horn of Gondor, Love of Tales, Wandering Took, Out of the Wild, Wingfoot, We Are Not Idle

4: Erebor Battle Master, Expert Treasure Hunter, Boromir, Hama, Caldara, A Burning Brand, Legacy of Durin, Erebor Battle Master again.

The essence of the ABB superdefender is all present in the very first cycle -- Unexpected Courage, Song of Wisdom (if not Lore), A Burning Brand.  The premise that 4 safe defenses are fine (up to 13 if players cooperate) but more than that is abusive is hard for me to swallow.  Here's the repeatable readying attachments (that can ready after a defense) in release order:

Unexpected Courage (core)

Fast Hitch (Dead Marshes) [hobbit only]

Miruvor (Shadow and Flame) [requires putting back on deck and using your draw to repeat]

Spare Hood and Cloak (OHUH) [requires somebody else having and exhausting]

Heir of Mardil (Celebrimbor's Secret) [requires Noble and getting a resource, unique]

Shadowfax (Treason of Saruman) [requires Gandalf, unique]

Armored Destrier (Temple of the Deceived) [requires Sentinel or Leadership, takes a restricted slot]

Magic Ring (Crossings of Poros) [limit 1 per hero and 1 per deck, raises threat]

Elvenking (Fire in the Night) [requires Silvan and return to hand of Silvan ally, unique]

Ring of Thror (Ghost of Framsburg) [requires Dwarf, unique, guarded]

In the case of Mighty Beregond, the easy readies are UC, Armored Destrier (wastes a restricted slot), and Magic Ring (1 per deck, 1 per hero).  There's a host of events or temporary attachments that ready, but there were plenty of those when Tactics Beregond came out.  In the common case, the super defender is where he's always been.  There's two exceptions that can dramatically increase the number of readies:

1) Erestor + Miruvor.  Miruvor as repeatable ready has the unattractive feature of costing you your only draw for a single ready, and only Bilbo and Gleowine got you past that.  But Erestor/Arwen/Defender guarantees you can draw all three Miruvor and pay for at least two -- guarantees all three if the defender has spirit.  Looking at the decks using Beregond/ABB/UC (not that many), this is a reasonably popular combination.  However, at this point it's not exactly a new combination, we're on the third cycle since Angmar and there's been two FAQs since this popped up.

2) Spare Hood and Cloak + Long Lake Trader.  This isn't nearly as efficient as Erestor/Miruvor, since it requires a LLT for every cloak and also a suitable target to use it (likely the North Realm Lookout).  Outside a Dale deck it's a three card combo to provide a single repeatable ready -- inside a Dale Deck the excellent Redwater Sentry really reduces the value of having a hero defender in the first place.  I only saw one deck that bothered with this combo.

Indeed, looking at the ABB/Beregond/UC decks, except for the Erestor decks the norm for readying was Unexpected Courage supplemented by a handful of temporary readies depending on sphere (Behind Strong Walls or Desparate Defense).  If readying too much is a problem, you don't have to fix all readying cards at all -- you would just have to put "limit 1 per hero" on the very few non-unique/restricted attachments that provide repeatable readying, all of which were released before Beregond.  I'm not necessarily saying that the designers *should* do this, though it's the logical extension of TaBoromir's nerf.  It'd be a much bigger hit to SuperBeregond in 4-player than nerfing ABB, I think.  My point is rather that if the Miruvor/Erestor/UC combo providing up to seven defenses (and getting to key cards quickly) wasn't deemed "abusive" enough to fix in FAQ 1.8 and 1.9, I don't think the single ready from Magic Ring and the expensive setup of the Long Lake Trader combo remotely crosses the line for the next FAQ.  In terms of the common case, most new players have only a single Unexpected Courage anyways.

Google tells me that way back when FAQ 1.3 nerfed Beravor, making UC limit 1 per hero was suggested as an alternative errata.

It's known, because Caleb said as much when the combo was discovered, that the combo with Vanish from Sight was what triggered the Wandering Took errata.  But that Wandering Took had the *potential* for massive threat reduction from its lack of limits was demonstrated, even if not forseen in the core set, by the Earendil/Took/LoAragorn combo discovered and publicized way back in 2012.  I don't think it's a low blow to the designer's intelligence to suggest that *any* card released without limit should be assumed to be exercised in the future an arbitrary number of times in a single round or phase -- if that's deemed too strong, then it's too strong *at release*.

I don't think there's the least bit of evidence that errata from the designers is only really intended to be used against *future* content.  All errata is of form "X should read", and a large portion of it is obviously prompted by its strength in the *current* card pool against *existing* quests.  I can't think of a single card released subsequent to an errata that made me say "Whoa, this couldn't have been released without the errata to X"--maybe something has slipped my mind?

You are right, that Restricted makes no sense on the Horn, as the only other restriced ressource generators are Sword of Númenor and Orcrist, both require killing an enemy.

1) You are correct that *if* you need sentinel, because you're playing multiplayer (almost guaranteed, if you're mono-tactics) and need to defend cross-table, keeping your Winged Guardians around is preferable.  In a solo deck the value of sentinel is extremely limited, and while mono-tactics Eagles decks had to wait for later cards to be solo-viable, Eagles in a tactics-dominant deck were solo-capable before then.  Consider the Return to Mirkwood deck used for Beorn's Path, something I recommend *every* new player follow as far as possible.  It has Eagles (3x Vassal, 3x Guardian, 2x Misty, 3x Eagles are Coming).  I can tell you from experience, tactics resources were tight.  It also has 3x Gandalf and 3x Escort from Edoras and (of course) the lone copy of Horn of Gondor from the core set.  If it came up, it was very useful.  If Beorn were redoing it now, I doubt it would make the cut.

Buffing Misty and getting a resource is obviously better than buffing Misty alone.  It's not remotely game-breaking, though, and wasn't even powerful enough to make Eagles a popular archtype -- Vassal/Guardians account for a maximum of six buffs during the entire game, and it's usually much less.  No effect in the game is "reward enough" to discourage looking for synergies with that effect.

It's true that if you chump block with Vassal you get a reward from Horn of Gondor in its current form.  But in its original form you get a reward from Horn of Gondor whether he defends *or* attacks, so a hypothetical exhausting HoG with its original reward is worth including in an Eagles deck, and the current version is typically not.

2) My usual procedure with Support of the Eagles is to try to get a Vassal and/or Guardian out first, not using them, and then get out Support of Eagles on the real target -- as you might expect, also trying to get the real target to ready.  Then I get Misty out, let the Vassal go (keeps attack at 3) then let the Guardian go (keeps defense at 4) -- any Eagles discarded after that just bump it higher.  Misty is a backup combat action, if I've got readying on a hero with a Support of the Eagles (or better, three of them) it may end up being an expensive quester.  It's an expensive setup, and without other cards leaving play doesn't provide a huge return on the original Horn -- but if that's all you have it's better than nothing.

3) Who plans on having a hero killed?  Landroval's expensive insurance, but because he's an Eagle he shows up in Eagle decks for thematic reasons, while a Veteran Axehand does not.  Landroval's strictly superior to Axehand, having more willpower, attack and hit points plus a useful-if-things-go-badly ability.  He's also much more expensive.  I don't view "Tactics players should just play cheaper cards instead" as a valid reason for nerfing a Tactics resource generator.  Tactics has some expensive cards, why not give Tactics tools to help pay for them?

4) However useful 2 willpower may be (and in tactics, providing willpower usually *isn't* a big concern), it doesn't pay for cards.  Radagast helps pay for Eagles, which are expensive, but he costs 5 up front and so takes 5 to break even.  That's why he drops out of Eagles decks and isn't found at all outside them.  Radagast's Staff coming in the next pack should make him much more attractive, as that is well worth the money to get in play.

5) I believe 2.5 per card is one of the most expensive per-card values in all my Stereotypical Decks.  It has no cost reducers, but it does have a card (The Eagles are Coming) that can draw expensive Eagles into your hand.  With Mablung the 3-4 resources covers the card you draw at the beginning of the turn, but you start with 7 cards and no resources.  It will be one of the slowest decks in the series to empty its hand.

6) Yes, the designers have introduced a competitive mode into this cooperative game, and soon it may actually be available for purchase at a store near me -- that doesn't change the fact that it is designed and 99.9% played as a cooperative/solo game -- in fact, at last year's Fellowship event I ended up playing the quest *cooperatively* instead of competitively.  Handling "balance" for the tiny share of play in competitive mode would be much better handled with a restricted list than errata that hampers the vastly larger pool of cooperative players.

Yes, the solo league does introduce a competitive element into cooperative play.  But there aren't a lot of us playing in it, I think most who play do it for fun rather than trying to design the most efficient deck possible, we explicitly use an out-of-the-rules variant with the tokens to guarantee wins against each scenario (eventually) and use arbitrary tiebreakers in the common case where no tokens at all are needed.  I am *totally* uninterested in any league rules (let alone errata) to ensure that the decks used in the league are of equivalent strength, and incoming errata *complicates* the league rather than improving it.  It's possible someone in the league is using the new A Burning Brand already....

"Too easy" and "too hard" is purely subjective, and easily controlled by player decisions of what to put in their decks *and* what mode of a quest to play.  With the exception of lone players ruining a pickup multiplayer game, there is ABSOLUTELY NO REASON for the designers to worry about a particular combination being "too strong", as cooperative players who think it too strong can just not play it -- it follows that when *fixing* the possibility of a lone player doing an extreme combo, the least damage would be done by preserving the common case and trying to errata to only affect the extreme case.  Exhausting Horn of Gondor would've done that way back in the Hammersmith/Born Aloft combo, they didn't fix it and so it got exploited again.  I'm not complaining that they errata-ed Horn of Gondor, I'm complaining about *how* they errata-ed Horn of Gondor.

7) I don't believe in a fixed "game economy", but if I did, the *usual* usage of Horn of Gondor did not break it even before errata.  Certainly an exhausting Horn of Gondor that reacted to leaving play would not.

8 ) Yes, I am leaving Horn of Gondor out of decks.  I used to use it -- now I don't.  There are still circumstances where the card is useful to somebody, but they took a card that *was* useful to me and made it not useful to me.  My effective card pool got smaller because of the errata.

9) I would love to see an actually thematic effect for Boromir's Horn, but it would have to be renamed to exist as a player card.  Mablung generates when engaged -- a Horn that generates a resource when *revealed* would be kind of cool, and should exhaust when it does so.

Good candidate, though it's still free if you chump what he grabs :).

Seriously, the synergy would be terrific, but not overpowering.  It would make the ability effectively free *if* he found an ally, but it's a once per round ability and IMO wouldn't be "broken" under that circumstance.

@dalestephenson [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/256741-dalestephenson/], clearly the two of us have different experiences with the game and none of us is going to convince the other, so I propose, we agree to disagree. I'd rather play the game or do another hobby than spending hours on discussing errata.

Well, this is an easy thing to settle. You make a super-defender deck using cards out of the first 3 cycles, and I'll make one using the modern card pool, and we can compare how many round it takes each one to achieve super-defender status.

The truth is it's way, way easier now, despite the pieces (UC, Song of Wisdom, ABB) being around for a while. It's not just the readying effects you have to consider. Its a combo-deck that requires lots of pieces working together, and we've got lots more card draw and resource acceleration than we used to, which helps in gathering all these pieces.

Hama could be used to abuse some recent tactics events. In the right deck, recurring Oath of Eorl is not that different from recurring Thicket of Spears, and more recently, he could be used with Gwaihir's Debt to play core set Gandalf for 1 resource every round of the game.

The comment I was replying to said that an errata is a statement that the card was too powerful, even in progression mode. But Earendil/LoAragorn were not available in progression mode.

Wanting more per-round restrictions is a reasonable position. But slapping a limit on everything under the sun is:

1. Ugly, as in many cases it would be redundant and confusing. Some confused guy: "Why does Erestor say 'Limit once per round' on his forced discard ability???". Developer: "Well, maybe some card in the future will make you trigger end of round effect multiple times, and then there might be cards further in the future that can be used to exploit that." Confused guy: "..."

2. Not necessarily effective. You can't predict what cards will come out years in the future, and the limit you set may not be low enough and require errata anyway.

3. Infeasible. It would require issuing an errata for more than half the cards in the card pool at this point. If the argument that these cards should have had limits to begin with, ok (see above 2 points), but this is not the fault of the current designer.

And yes, it's a low blow to the current designer to suggest that he is both saying A: "this card was broken to begin with" and B: "I only decided to errata this now". If instead we hold the designer in high regard, then only one of those statements can be true. And given that B is true, A must be false.

It is incredibly hard to design an expanding card game, with no rotation, with no promise of being the sole developer, that will experience no broken combos for almost a decade, and I feel like you are not giving the developers enough credit for the remarkable job they've done in limiting them.

'Free if you use the ability solely for chumps' and 'always free even if you spawn ally Beorn every single time' are two very different situations.

Regardless of your opinion on the precise power level, Imrahil's ability is supposed to be balanced by the cost ttached to it. Being able to entirely obviate that cost is clearly against the design of the card, which some would certainly define as broken.

Erestor and Arwen strike again!  Seriously, I think Gather Information and Heed the Dream are also huge factors in making combo decks more reliable.  I look forward to Radagast enjoying Word of Command -- unlike Gandalf, he doesn't block a popular ally.

But if the end state is indeed abusive and needs to be *prevented* from happening in uncoordinated multi-player games, it was abusive back when it was achieved later in the game on average.  It's also not especially a recent development -- your Tower of Beregond comes together quite reliably I'm sure, with only one card (a single copy of Ioreth) later than Grey Havens.

Oath of Eorl's not that different and in a few circumstances might be better -- but recurring Thicket of Spears with Hama was considered fine after its own errata, it wasn't until later that it was decided to be abusive after all.

Recurring Gwaihir's Debt every turn *is* pretty overpowered, and could easily be done in Radagast/Hama/Tactics eagle deck with the help of Wizard's Pipe.  Can't argue with that, and I guess with Hama's nerf I'll have to settle for playing Gandalf four times in a row.  Plus two for the other two Gwaihir's Debt copies.  Plus three for Tome of Atanator.  Plus three for post-Tome fetches with Word of Command.  Maybe I can squeeze in Hammersmith to get Tomes back -- Booyah!

The problem, as I see it, with the Hama nerf is that if a Tactics event is so powerful that it can't be played every turn without breaking the game (and Gwaihir's Debt w. Wizard Pipe is a good candidate, I think), it's probably too powerful to be recurred 3 times in a row or by records.  YMMV.

I disagree. A combo that is only achievable by late game is not as problematic as one that can be achieved in early game.

Sure, the deck is not exactly recent, but neither is the last FAQ. That deck came out in early 2017, and the last FAQ we got was later that same year. It takes time for these kinds of decks to spread through the meta.

And who knows? Maybe the errata is not in response to super-beregond in particular. Maybe it's about something they know, but we dont. Like maybe they want to release a 3+ defense sentinel defender in the lore sphere, something they simply can't do with the current ABB in the card pool. The last (only) sentinel lore hero we got was Loragron, back in 2012.

That may have sense, because after all, the errata on ABB does not prevent making Erkenbrand the new superdefender, it just needs a bit more resources than setting Beregond.

This actually supports the point I'm trying to make. Hama+Thicket was incredibly hard to keep up indefinitely. It cost you all your resources and your card draw for the turn. Since you were locked into mono-tactics, you had very little extra card draw or resource generation in order to do anything else. All you do is play thicket, and discard the card you drew that round to get it back. Oh, and if you didn't have thicket in your opening hand, it might be a half-dozen rounds until you draw into it, making the whole thing incredibly high risk.

Enter Amarthiul, who broke open that mono-tactics restriction and had a native ability of generating extra resources for having enemies engaged. With Amarthiul's access to Steward, you could actually afford to keep up Hammer-stroke as well to take on all enemies every round. Suddenly, with a development in the card pool, some older, balanced-at-the-time cards became able to dominate all combat at the table. Sound familiar?

I do agree that the Hama errata doesn't necessarily prevent all abuse of his ability. But give that deck you suggested a try and see how it works out. Paying 3 cost for Gandalf by recycling Tomes is not the same as paying 1. You're also "wasting" all your Word of Commands fetching more copies. The deck you're describing sounds fully devoted to the Gandalf recycle strategy. And when a deck goes that route it can be strong but not broken (see Sneak Attack + Tome of Atanatar decks). The one I described with pre-errata Hama can be devoted to other things, making it a solid deck with an extra Gandalf/round as a cherry on top.

Earendil/LoAragorn come online early in progression mode.  But (full confession) I didn't think the more powerful Took/Vanish combo was worth fixing with errata -- you can't "abuse" Wandering Took without passing it back and forth, which means anyone who gets his threat reduced with an unlimited Took is *cooperating* in doing so, and I don't see that as a problem to be fixed.  So I think Took should've only had his limit from the beginning *if* the designer felt that threat reduction was one of those things that needed to be *prevented* from being used in a loop.

I don't know the designers, but I think it's quite possible that Nate French and Caleb have different philosophies for this sort of thing.  How many cards that have been errata-ed by Caleb were designed by Caleb?

I'm not calling for a limit on "everything under the sun".  I'm calling for a limit on effects that would be problematic if recurred an arbitrary number of times.  Horn of Gondor generates resources and doesn't exhaust to do so -- a limit would be sensible.  Horn of Gondor aside, how many resource generators in the game *don't* have a limit?  All of the attachments do, I believe, and with WANI's nerf it may just be Traffic From Dale that can generate insane resources.  On the card side, with Legacy of Durin nerfed that just leaves Lord of Morthond and Rod of the Steward among attachments.

Now if you wanted to attack readying -- which I don't, but hypothetically suppose it was considered an errata worthy problem.  Slap "limit 1 per hero" on UC, Fast Hitch and Miruvor and "limit 1 per character" on Spare Hood and Cloak and you're done -- there's lots of readying cards, but almost all are *already* limited.

At this point in the game, it's rare to see a card that isn't limited in some way.

Please don't confuse criticism of errata with criticism of the state of the game or the qualities of the designer.  It's a minor irritant for me in a game that, I think, is better than ever.  Errata is the least of Caleb's jobs, and he managed to skip it completely in 2018 (which bothers me not at all).  *Most* of the errata, if you grant the need for errata, was well done and preserved the "common case".  And through 2017 power-level errata (though annoying to me) was affecting only a fraction of the powerful cards.  I hope that 2019 doesn't represent a change in philosophy, and when the next FAQ comes out we'll see if it has.

I'm from a wargame background, so I'm not coming in with the idea that errata is some sort of sin or bad reflection on a game -- it happens, and the more complex a game is the more likely it is to happen.  But from that same background I also come with the idea that errata is *not* another name for an optional rule, and that errata *always* has costs as well as benefits.

Sure, but the difference between Chump and Beorn is *way* bigger than the difference between getting your resource back and not getting your resource back.  Imrahil's ability generating one resource per turn and paying for itself (if it hits) isn't remotely broken because it's just one resource a turn -- it doesn't let him recur his ability by giving that resource back, which is what you'd need to make TaImrahil broken.

Imrahil's ability is balanced by the cost he paid for it.  Horn of Gondor generating resources is balanced by the cost paid for it (plus that stupid Restricted slot).  I have LeGimli and put Dwarven Shield and The Day's Rising -- now when he defends, he *always* gets the resource he needs to ready Legolas.  That doesn't mean I'm doing something "clearly against the design of the card", it means I'm using synergy between cards that are working as designed.

Is Wandering Took's ability problematic if recurred an arbitrary number of times? Not in the core set. It's not possible to know these things unless you know every card that will come afterward. I agree that it's wise to limit resource generation effects though, even if there are no immediate problematic combos. Horn of Gondor, for example, can still be abused in its post-errata state.

At some point, given a growing card pool, there will be enough different reading effects, that even if limited to 1 per hero, they'd still be problematic when all stacked on the same hero.

Yes, but Arkham horror does not force anyone to play with errated cards because they do not reprint cards with the errata. The errata stays in the document only. For me this is the key difference.

I grant your point on Wandering Took.  Certain effects it would be possible to predict in advance that recurring the effect is problematic (e.g. Horn of Gondor), but shifting threat back and forth between players with no net loss is not one of those effects.

I like your everything costs 1.  With an assist from Elven-Light both Miruvor could be seen as permanent readying, and that card was on my four-card list of "1 per hero" if readying needed limited.  But the five one-short readying cards in the deck give you a maximum of five total readies for each run through the deck, and less than that if a Zigil Miner gets them.  Defending five attacks per turn can only be done twice in each run through the deck, defending six attacks per turn can only be done once.  I'll grant that you could easily design a deck with more of the temporary readies, but to the extent that readying is a problem, none of the temporaries have the impact that a permanent readier does in the same slot in the deck.

But it's also true there's enough different permanent readiers that you can get to a high number of readies with just one of each.  So if we take LeGimli (dwarf, noble, sentinel):

1 UC

1 Magic Ring (costs threat)

1 Ring of Thror (guarded)

1 Armored Destrier (takes a restricted slot)

1 Miruvor (consumes draw)

1 Heir of Mardil (combo with resource transfer/generation)

1 Elvenking (combo with Elf-friend and Silvan ally)

1 Spare Hood and Cloak (combo with LTT/Lookout)

That's no less than 8 readies every turn.  But it takes a *lot* of cards to pull off.  With the help of Diligent Noble, Beregond could use seven of these; the setup cost is obviously much greater than 3x UC, 3x Miruvor (w Erestor/Arwen), Magic Ring.

If we consider a hypothetical mono-tactics Hama deck with 3x Thicket of Spears, it's certainly true that recurring it took your only card and all your native resources.  But I don't see that in the ~43% chance that you didn't draw Thicket it was an "incredibly high risk".  You've got 47 other cards in your deck, and you do with those 47 cards what mono-tactics would usually do with such things.  It's a deck that *can* prevent engaged enemies from doing things indefinitely once Thicket shows up (~57% chance in opening hands), and so is more likely than not to be able to prevent enemy attacks from turn one, but there's nothing about include Thicket that nerfs the rest of your deck if it doesn't show up.

But you're also not limited to tactics heroes or tactics cards, since Thicket doesn't require printed tactics icons.  The errata to Thicket came after the Hobbit saga and HoN -- you have Good Harvest and Song of Battle.  Starting with Beravor means you can't play Thicket on turn one, but you'll be able to play it before long and you'll be able to do more than just play Thicket, and even mono-tactics with Good Harvest/Steward will be able to afford other cards.

Amarthiul lets you have an extra resource, and eventually that can translate into extra cards, but he doesn't enable Hammer Stroke and Thicket every round because Hama can only recur one.  He's certainly an improvement on straight mono-tactics, no enhancements Thicket, but it's not fundamentally different than earlier errata-approved Thicket play -- you can stop combat every turn and you can monopolize to the extent you can engage enemies.  More problematic to me (in terms of interfering with other players) is Tactics Aragorn's built-in ability to steal enemies -- now you can stop attacks *and* steal enemies consistently from other players who don't want you to monopolize combat. As you know, I'm not concerned about "balance" or "monopolization" when players cooperate or play alone.

Of course, even if you accept that the Hama/Thicket combination was a problem needing to be fixed, it doesn't necessarily follow that the errata Hama received was the best way to fix it.

Paying 3 cost for Gandalf by recycling Tomes is not the same as paying 1. You're also "wasting" all your Word of Commands fetching more copies. The deck you're describing sounds fully devoted to the Gandalf recycle strategy. And when a deck goes that route it can be strong but not broken (see Sneak Attack + Tome of Atanatar decks). The one I described with pre-errata Hama can be devoted to other things, making it a solid deck with an extra Gandalf/round as a cherry on top.﻿

Pre-errata Gwaihir's Debt with Radagast would be pretty insane, true.  Using records to recycle Gwaihir's Debt doesn't take a lot of deck space, since only the records would need to be added to the cards you'd have everywhere, but paying 2-3 for core Gandalf obviously isn't as good as playing one.

But dropping the records entirely, four consecutive Gandalf plays for 1 cost is still pretty compelling to me, about a jillion times more powerful than playing Eagles Are Coming four consecutive times.  That's my main grief with the Hama nerf -- instead of targeting the recurrence of powerful events, it made it so you can't afford to use Hama on anything but recurring powerful events.

Like maybe they want to release a 3+ defense sentinel defender in the lore sphere, something they simply can't do with the current ABB in the card pool. The last (only) sentinel lore hero we got was Loragron, back in 2012.

I see no reason why they "simply can't" release a 3+ defense sentinel defender in Lore, given that it's nearly as cheap and easy to make a Lore hero sentinel as it is to make a non-Lore sentinel become Lore.  If you release Beregond himself in Lore, it'd only save him the play of a single 1-cost neutral card compared to his brethren -- if they aren't broken, he wouldn't be either.  Unless you also gave him the Hobbit trait....

You can be forgiven for not watching the hour long video of the deck. But in it, I take on 7 attacks on back to back turns with only Beregond as a defender, without putting on more than 1 miruvor at a time. And while I grant that I could probably not keep that indefinitely, my self-imposed deckbuilding restrictions prevented me from using any repeatable readying attachments (other than Miruvor).

Do you think UC + Magic Ring + Miruvor is that much harder to set up than 3 UC? That gives Beregond 4 defenses a round, with consumables like Lembas and Behind Strong Walls for turns that spike above that.

Correction, the finding and playing of a 1-cost neutral attachment. A Lore Beregond would free up the demands of the deck to have massive card draw, as you no longer have to play pieces in a specific order. It is possible to have a card pool in which a 2 card combo is well-balanced while the same combo reduced to 1 card is seen as overpowered.

7 attacks back-to-back with one Miruvor is impressive, since it requires using all five consumables in the deck on consecutive turns.  No, I don't think that's sustainable.  I didn't watch the video, but I did see in the deck description "For one attempt I had a bunch of enemies engage me all in one turn, and Beregond defended five or six times, putting Unexpected Courage to shame, and next turn I just reshuffled my deck and drew into all the same readying cards and did it all again."  The first burst of defenses seems easy enough, since if you don't need the consumable readies they'll accumulate until you need them for a burst of defenses.  But I'd think drawing most (or all, for seven defenses) after a reshuffle would require either remarkable luck or a huge pile of resources to exploit Elven-Light with.  How many turns does this deck take before you've run through it four times?

If you include one copy each of UC, Magic Ring and Miruvor it's slightly easier to set up as 3x UC -- there's three cards either way, Miruvor is cheaper and Magic Ring is neutral.  If Miruvor/UC were 1 per hero you could get setup faster by including 3x of Miruvor and UC in your deck, at the cost of deck space.  But though it'd give you 3 readies, it's at a higher cost than 3x UC, since Magic Ring costs threat and Miruvor costs draw.  Still, you can get additional draw and SpBeregond can get your threat back.  4 + consumables can't be prevented.  7 defenses with just UC and Miruvor could be, if that much readying is a problem that needs to be fixed in the first place.  ABB nerf doesn't fix that -- you were just saying you took 7 back-to-back, and the only shadow cancellation is in the sideboard with only the 2x Lembas for healing.  When you can defend for 6-11, there's an awful lot of shadows that can be ignored.

It's a fair point that ABB + Song of Wisdom is a two card combo that also has to be played in the right order -- but giving sentinel to a Lore hero is a one card combo and there's two different cards that can do it (three if Elf/Dwarf), still not that common.  I think a larger problem rests with the Lore defenders themselves:

Denethor is fragile (3 hp) and has an ability that needs him ready at turn end and is most powerful in solo.

Elrond wants to use an exhaustion on Vilya.

Rossiel is fragile (3 hp) and needs setup to defend for 4 instead of 2.

Treebeard has excellent defensive stats, but his ability lets him boost willpower/attack only and he can't have restricted attachments.

And that's the entire set until Radagast comes out, who actually is a good defensive candidate at 3/4, especially since he can also quest for free and has no other exhaustion demands other than Word of Command.  Though being Istari does hurt him with the potential defensive attachments.

I suspect the lack of sentinel Lore heroes isn't because of ABB in particular, I think it has to do with stereotyping sentinel as a leadership/tactics thing.  The only three spirit/tactics sentinel are all repeat heroes that had their first version as sentinel also.  (OTOH, there's only one sentinel lore ally, and spirit has three, though Jubyar's got his own shadow protection going.)

I don’t think the lack of strong sentinel heroes in lore is because ABB. It seems to me it is more due to it not fitting in the sphere archetype.

I thought your original point was ABB was the reason lore didn't get *sentinel* (protect multiplayer), not that the weakness of the specific Lore defense candidates was a result of ABB.  Still, while we agree that there's no good dedicated lore defenders (Radagast IMO will immediately become the best in that role despite his lack of useful traits), there's no way short of a statement from Caleb to know *why* there isn't.  I think it's more plausible that it's just seen as more of a leadership/tactics thing -- the two defense-ability spirit heroes both reduce threat, an exclusively spirit thing.  If we ever get a first class lore defender, I expect it to have some trigger with cards or healing or scrying, because that's lore's thing.

It's also worth remembering that when we talk about 3+ defense and sentinel, there's only three distinct heroes that qualify, period:  Beregond, Erkenbrand, and the recent Grimbeorn.  It's not remarkable at all that Lore is left out when there are so few.

Maybe cutting Ents out of ABB eligibility will lead to some better Lore allies worth putting ABB on.  Now that the ents have been cut out of the loop, there's not a lot of non-temporary characters who can take it with at least 2 def and 3 hp -- Haldir, Gildor (exhaust ability), Firyal (quest ability), and the new Mirkwood Hunter.  They also all cost 4+ now that the ents are excluded, though the last gets a discount.    By contrast, spirit has seven in that category and two of them cost less than 4.  Even neutral also has four, two of which are three cost (though Thalion can become Lore).  (For completeness, leadership has ten and tactics has six that can take restricted attachments -- clearly leadership is thought of as the defense sphere, as hero Elfhelm shows.) 

Maybe now that ABB is restricted and exhausts, we can get some way of giving allies Lore?  That'd be pretty sweet.

Well, it's both. I think the reason we haven't seen a dedicated lore defensive hero is due to ABB, sentinel or no.

I'm not sure what "the two defense-ability spirit heroes" you are referring to. Beregond and Fastred? But spirit has others: Theoden (sentinel), Frodo (raise threat), and Dain (increase defense).

Heroes with a defensive ability:

Tactics: Beregond, Beorn, Dori, Grimbeorn, Boromir, Theoden

Leadership: Aragorn, Elrohir, Erkenbrand, Gimli, Gloin

Spirit: Beregond, Fastred, Theoden, Frodo, Dain

Lore: Aragorn, Rossiel

There's a clear imbalance here.

There's actually 2 distinct Beregonds. And it's not that surprising. When you release a 3+ sentinel defender in a sphere, you are signalling that it is meant to be that sphere's best defensive hero. I don't expect to see many competing for that role in the same sphere. But lore is the only sphere with none.

Will Radagast really be better than Denethor for defending? He has one hitpoint more and can be used for questing, but he also has 3 threat more, lacks the Gondor trait for Gondorian Shield and Noble for Ancestral Armour. And with Bard, Son of Brand it is not so hard to bring off-sphere attachments out.

When you release a 3+ sentinel defender in a sphere, you are signalling that it is meant to be that sphere's best defensive hero. I don't expect to see many competing for that role in the same sphere. But lore is the only sphere with none.

For "defense ability" I was thinking specifically of 3+ defense with defense-related ability, which excludes Frodo and Rossiel.  I just forgot about Dain, and his ability doesn't link into traditional spirit strength (though it obviously links with dwarven mining, which has its key cards in spirit).  I also specified abilities -- sentinel can be a useful trait, but a 3 attack/2 defense hero with sentinel is not what I consider to be a dedicated defensive hero.

Distinct may not be the right word to group the two Beregonds together, but they deserve to be grouped together.  I don't see releasing Beregond in Spirit as happening because Spirit needed a first class defender, I see releasing Beregond in Spirit to be a consequence of needing to release Beregond in Flame of the West -- he *had* to be in that box, and neither Lore nor Leadership makes sense for Beregond in the context of Book V.  The three named individuals chosen to be first class sentinel defenders (Beregond, Grimbeorn, Erkenbrand) have no connections to Lore.  Now it's perfectly true that the designers didn't have to release a Beregond hero at all, they could've had a (Tactics) Beregond ally and moved LeEomer up a box, and that would've been just as thematic.  But to buy that the designers aim was specifically to provide Spirit a first-classs defender while neglecting Lore, I'd need to see an *invented* hero in that role.

Fastred comes close in that while he's not invented, there's nothing at all known about it him save his death and nation.  But given Rohan, putting him in Spirit is the most natural sphere (and Lore least likely), and his ability specifically synergizes with Rohan-attacking-staging -- plus he reduces threat, which puts him firmly in Spirit.  There is exactly *one* hero who was FFG invented on your list of defensive heroes, and that hero is in Lore.  Further, the other Lore hero on your list (Aragorn) actually has an ability that naturally belongs in Spirit!  While there's an imbalance, the FFG-invented hero and the out-of-expected-sphere ability are both butressing Lore.

When you release a 3+ defense sentinel hero, I don't think you're signaling that it's meant to be that sphere's best defensive hero (was that really the purpose of releasing Grimbeorn in tactics) -- I think it's just signaling that it's meant to be a candidate for the best multiplayer defensive hero, period.  With such a small sample size drawing broad conclusions from Lore's exclusion doesn't seem warranted to me.

If the designers are going, sometime in the future, release such a player in Lore, what would it be?  Woodmen needs help and is lore-heavy, I think that's the best candidate for an invented defensive hero.  Dwarfdom's best defensive hero (stat-wise) already has two hero versions.  There's three 2/5 dwarves, but Bombur is already in Lore and Gimli has two versions -- I would love to see a lore Dori hero, which I think would be sentinel if ever made.  There's a bunch of 2/4 dwarves not in Lore (Nori, Balin, Dwalin, Thalin), but one is invented and one died in Moria. Gloin's a defender in Leadership, but has poor defensive stats and would not be a defender elsewhere.  Plus with the possible exception of Bilbo-carrying Dori and the ineligible exception of Balin, none are as prominent in the canon as Dain.  (Gimli is so prominent that he would get a third version if any dwarf did, but so far only Aragorn has met that hurdle.) I think Bofur is the best bet for a brand new dwarf defender since he lacks a hero version -- both his ally versions are terrible defenders, but that doesn't mean much.  Ithilien Rangers are concentrated in Lore, but Faramir, Mablung and Damrod are most prominent and already have hero versions; Anborn is probably next most prominent and doesn't have a hero version.  Dunedain could use a first-class defender more than anybody and has reasonable representation in Lore.  I'm also expecting a new Eastern tribe to be in the next cycle if they go East instead of dipping down into Mordor, as I hope/expect.

And with Bard, Son of Brand it is not so hard to bring off-sphere attachments out.

Bard is great for off-sphere attachments, but Bard himself is off-sphere to LoDenethor and Radagast, and if you're going off sphere to bolster defense (which you pretty much are required to do in any sphere except monoSpirit with spBard) you can just include tactics or leadership normally.  If you're looking to set up a multiplayer Super Defender, then LoDenethor (prior to the ABB nerf) has an advantage over LeDenethor and Radagast fully-loaded because he can do G. Shield/Ancestral Armour/ABB combo without a prerequisite card (Song of Wisdom for LeDenethor, Diligent Noble for Radagast) -- but you can't do it anymore, and you still need sentinel + readies, and you could start with a bunch of other more sturdy defenders in the first place, etcetera.  Bilbo might be the best pre-errata Lore super defender just because of Fast Hitch.

Post-errata and outside the super defender role -- say as the primary defender in a solo deck or even in a two-deck fellowship, I like Radagast better than LoDenethor.  Two more threat, but that's a negligible factor in defender quality.  Ancestral Armor is great, but so expensive, setup with G. Shield/ABB seems more likely.  Once setup, that gives an advantage to LoDenethor in that 5/3 is better than 4/4 defensively.  But it's not enough (in my mind) to offset being able to survive a 6-strength attack *before* getting a Shield on.  In Lore itself the defensive options are the same for both, of course, and the healing favors the higher hp hero.

But the biggest factor in my mind is their respective abilities.  LoDenethor's ability is blocked by defending, while Radagast's ability is compatible with defending.  And especially solo, Radagast's potential to quest for 2 for a resource (or free, once he gets his staff) and still defend looms large for me -- as does the prospect of guaranteed card draw with the Wizard Pipe + Messenger Raven (or ETH).  Radagast can defend + help you elsewhere.  Denethor can defend at the expense of not being able to help you elsewhere.  Now to be clear, the synergy and anti-synergy of their abilities with defense don't affect the defense *itself* unless you're using Protector of Lorien, it's just the reason that I think Radagast will be more attractive than LoDenethor in a splash-Lore-primary-defender role.  I think Radagast is going to be good fun even (or especially?) outside an Eagles deck.

One other point in the favor of Radagast as a defender is that his staff can be used to return a (non-unique) enemy to staging.  In general that's not optimal behavior, but it *does* mean that he can prevent an attack as needed, and that's a handy thing for a defender to have in his back pocket (unrestricted attachment, can only go on Beregond).  It can also be used to play Loyal Hound for free, and that's also a handy thing to have around for a hero defender.  I think that outweighs Denethor's ability to benefit from out-of-sphere events like For Gondor!, Behind Stone Walls, and Gondorian Discipline.

Thanks for your insight. Unfortunately, I lost my answer when my browser closed... Ah, well: The general idea was, that Denethor can be used for scrying and encounter manipulation, when there is no need to defend, which I value more than 2 extra willpower. Remember, in a solo game, enemies are less likely and scrying is crazy powerful. The probability to get the Gondorian Shield on Denethor in the first round is 57.5% when you mulligan for it. With Open the Armory you can increase that chance to 66.2% and more, if you get extra copies of the event. So in 2 out of 3 games you can start with the Shield and thus 5 defence.

Then the scenario also plays a factor: 3 less threat mean 3 extra rounds to prepare for a Hill Troll. With the Shield, Denethor can defend up to 2 times, depending on the shadow effect, while Radagast only survives once (one extra defence does not help without healing), which buys another round. With the next armour boost Denethor can defend against the likes of Durin's Bane or Thaurdir without taking damage.

Behind Strong Walls and Gondorian Discipline might be out of sphere, but have a sphere match with the Shield, so I see no problem there, if you use a tactics hero instead of Bard Son of Brand.

Both heroes have different advantages in a solo game, though in multiplayer Denethor loses faster compared to Radagast: Scrying just is no longer as powerful, while defending most likely gets covered by a more powerful hero with innate sentinel. Radagast's abilities and toys on the other hand remain useful.

Funny, that Fast Hitch makes an even weaker hero more useful for defending masses of enemies.

Btw. why does healing favour higher hp heroes? I would write that as less defence favours healing.

Yes, in one deck Denethor's ability is dead useful, when he's not defending.  I've not played LoDenethor with SpBard/Tactics, but I've played him a lot in the Beorn's Path lineup of Theodred/LeAragorn/LoDenethor.  There I rely on 3x Dunedain Warning for defense, though Ancestral Armor would be nice in the deck -- Steward typically goes on LoDenethor and he uses Rivendell Minstrel to fetch Song of Kings, so resources aren't much of an issue.  I'd guess I end up scrying at about 50% of the time, since getting rid of enemies quickly doesn't always happen in leadership/lore mix, using with Tactics it might be less defenses.  If mixing with spirit, UC can up the scrying considerably.

Whether the 3 threat differential makes a difference is quest-dependent -- most quests it doesn't matter much, but Journey Down the Anduin has that hard 30 -- but not necessarily for Radagast!  If you find his staff (and that would be worth mulliganing for) he doesn't have to defend the Troll at all until you're ready to take it down, just keep popping it back into staging -- with only 1 threat, that won't hurt you much and take as long as you want to prepare.  Since his staff is neutral, you can play it on turn one if either it or Word of Command is in your opening hand.

Healing favors the high hp hero only in the sense that (if you can heal it), it allows you to have a larger *consistent* defense.  If you can fully heal, you can absorb a (Def + hp - 1) attack each turn.  So for example, with plenty of healing and no boost to defense, Radagast can take a 6-strength attack *every turn*, and Denethor can't take it at all.  But that's really only with dedicated defending heroes and it takes a lot of healing -- for questers/attackers spot healing enables low hp heroes to stay alive indefinitely, even the 2 hp hobbits, so you aren't paying in threat for hps you aren't likely to need.

"Sentinel" is not a trait. It's an ability. Whether or not Loragorn is a useful defender in practice, he is a hero with a defensive ability.

But this goes to show my point even further: the only 2 lore heroes with defensive abilities aren't even that good at defending! And when you compare the two spheres that are traditionally less combat focused - lore and spirit - it 's clear that lore lags behind massively in the defense department. The only justification I can think of for this huge discrepancy is the presence of A Burning Brand. So I predict a lot more defense coming to lore now with the ABB errata.

We'll see.  If we consider LoAragorn and Rossiel not being that good at defending, the only good hero defenders in Spirit are Dain and Beregond, both originally released in other spheres and with abilities that tie them to spirit -- and Frodo who has terrible defensive stats but makes up for it by being indestructable.  But it's true that after starting Lore in the core set with the best defending hero and the only attachment that can increase defense, there's been hardly any help for defense (Cloak of Lorien) or even hp (Ent Draught).  The one thing it does have aplenty that's useful to heroic defenders is healing, and it nearly has a monopoly on that.

Spirit on the other hand has a bunch of events that increase defense -- but except for the hideous expensive and little used Light the Beacons, they all are in Angmar cycle or later.  It also has four attachments that boost defense or cancel damage, though two of those are in the last two packs of the current cycle.  So while Spirit's support over Lore for defense (ignoring healing) is massive, it's actually a fairly recent development and concentrated in packs with the borrowed top-flight defenders.

If you step down from the top-end defensive heroes borrowed from other spheres, I don't think Spirit has a massive advantage over Lore in the hero department -- Lore's heroes tend to be a bit more sturdy without giving up defense to spirit.  Bombur isn't going to be on anyone's list of excellent defensive heroes, but it's still what he does best -- Eleanor's best stat in defense, but is so fragile in a sphere without healing.

I hope you are right and the developers were just waiting for the ABB nerf to rain Lore-ish defensive goodness down upon us.  But I'm not confident myself -- I think Leadership and Tactics covers the defense for the sake of defense, and Lore are only going to get defenders if it is connected with an ability associated with the sphere, as has been the case with Spirit (and was the case with Rossiel, the last Lore hero to get an explicit defense-boosting ability).

This way he stays useful in multiplayer, one just needs to keep one's threat in check, which should be doable with Loragorn or Song of Eärendil. Of course, the Palantír can be used on any noble hero, but Denethor provides an ability to always get a hit and it would be highly thematic. As noted before, this would also give extra card draw, which is easier to set up than Radagast's combo, though not easier to maintain.

True, but it only helps once in a turn (or more often if you can pay your Wardens). Defence on the other hand is passive and thus better with readying effects and has no extra cost besides maybe taking up a restricted slot.

By the way, Frodo is not indestructible, can still be killed by a bad shadow effect: deal two damage to the defending character. Then you no longer can use his response on the attack itself.

LoDenethor/Palantir is pretty sweet for multiplayer scrying, (though by requiring two exhaustions it makes him an unlikely defender, but in multiplayer you can have help for that).  I think it's about the same setup as Radagast's Raven/Staff combo, since unless you have SpLegolas or TaBrand at the table it requires at least two cards.  Even with SpLegolas, you don't get the full benefit of the scrying because SpLegolas' player has already committed to the quest, and with TaBrand you need to have an engaged enemy to kill in order to get the ready. 

It's true that outside Gloin/Elrond/Warden healing isn't sustainable for multiple defenses.  Even without readying effects, I agree that defense is better than hp/healing -- if you prevent the damage in the first place, healing resources can be used elsewhere.

There aren't a lot of quests that can deal two damage to the defender while resolving shadow effects, but the point is well taken.  Despite being able to defend practically any attack right out of the box, I tend to forget Frodo as a defensive hero.  The threat raise and the once per phase limitation make me think of him as an emergency safety valve rather than a heroic defender.

Is this supposed to prove something? I've already quoted directly from the rules reference that Sentinel is an ability and you've confusingly held your ground.

The rules reference glossary under Sentinel calls it a "keyword ability", and the same wording is used for Ranged.  The glossary under "ability" includes keywords as a type along with action, response, forced, constant ability, and when revealed ability.  So from the glossary, I think it's clear that sentinel/ranged in fact are considered an ability.  Ranged and Sentinel appear to be the only two keyword abilities, the other keywords are not.

Fastred is 3/3.  I like Fastred a lot, but like Rossiel he is fragile.  Rossiel's 4 defense is conditional, but she's same sphere with ABB and her access to Cloak of Lorien is better than Fastred's access to Golden Shield in three ways -- it doesn't exhaust, it's not restricted, and it's in the same sphere.

Theoden has Sentinel, but Golden Shield gets him to 4 for only a single attack.  For a SuperDefender target, I'd rather have LoAragorn, who also has sentinel, has an extra hp, and is the right sphere for ABB.

Frodo has incredible survivability (at least for one attack per turn), but I'd prefer not to routinely raise my threat.  I'd rather rely on Treebeard or Denethor or Radagast, despite the lack of defensive abilities. YMMV.

Of course, part of the problem is that "best defensive hero" depends on the situation.  A heroic defender trying to cover the table in a four player game has different needs than a heroic defender in the "combat deck" of a 2-deck fellowship -- the former *needs* sentinel to do his job, while the latter can usually get by fine without it.  Then in a solo deck you have heroic defenders who some turns may not defend at all -- Beregond is strictly superior to Denethor as a defender, yet Lore Denethor still might be a better "defensive hero" for a solo deck because he's always useful.

Denethor requires the Palantír and a readying effect. Originally, I had Spirit Legolas in my list of cards that can ready him, but edited him out. After thinking for a while, I came to the conclusion that it still works: Use Denethor in the combat phase to scry the encounter deck, ready him in the refresh phase, use the Palantír at some point before commiting characters to the quest and then Legolas can ready him for the next combat phase. I do not consider this an ideal solution as it nets you one card less and Legolas questing for 1 is really poor without Gimli. That being said Magic Ring raises threat even more, which is counterproductive, so I guess the only usable options are Heir of Mardil + SoG or UC. If you have tons of cash, a Greenwood Archer and Elven-king with Elf-friend get you some extra readies, though the more complicated a combo becomes, the easier it is to fail. If you can work around the limitations of Bard or Legolas, you only need the one attachment, but both heroes are far from ideal, so 2 cards is the most common cause.

Radagast requires his staff, a pipe and a raven. Usually a 3 card combo is harder to get in one's hand than 2 or only 1 card. And while playing Lore, Gléowine is always an option for dependable card draw, the rest is just a cherry on top.

Radagast requires staff, pipe, and raven to get the card draw for free, but only Pipe and Raven for guaranteed card draw.  (ETH/Pipe also works, but requires successful questing).

Now the Pipe/Raven combo does cost 1 resource per turn (to put the raven back in play) if you don't have the staff (or use it on something else).  But that's not a bad price for a card *plus* Radagast questing without exhausting.  But it's certainly true that with 3-4 players being able to scry three cards before staging is *way* more useful than another 2 willpower.  Different story in one-deck solo, of course.

It's also worth remembering that Word of Command in a Radagast deck makes assembling *any* combo easier, if you can spare his action.

Wait, I'm confused. We agree then? You are using sphere-match with ABB as (one of) the selling points for why the lore defenders we've gotten are arguably as good, or better, than the spirit defenders. That's... exactly my point.

Sure, access to ABB was a selling point for a defending hero.  Still is, because shadows are what kill hero defenders.  I'm just not convinced that the existence of ABB (in un-errataed form) is the reason there aren't more/better Lore defenders, and we can expect better Lore defenders now that it's errata-ed.  The only characters I think might be broken in Lore with the old ABB are the allies who don't exhaust to defend.

But if you take shadow protection off the table, I'm still not convinced Fastred > Rossiel or SpTheoden > LoAragorn.

So your position is that even without ABB, Rossiel is a better defensive hero than Fastred? I wonder how many people would agree with this. I certainly don't.

I've always considered Rossiel a terrible hero. She requires significant setup to turn on her abilities, and she doesn't even help you do so. Even worse, the bonuses she does eventually get are redundant. To get her +willpower bonus, you are likely using Leave No Trace, which requires successful questing. To get her +defense bonus, you are likely using None Return, which requires successful dispatching of an enemy. And the cherry on top is that even after all that work, her ability isn't even consistent. It's win-more. In the first couple turns, which matter the most, she's useless. In fact, my victory display decks become more successful when I remove Rossiel, which is just sad.

Meanwhile, Fastred is the defensive hero in a top-tier deck archtype. His 3/3 statline is enough for early game, particularly when he actively helps you avoid engaging the heavy hitters by keeping your threat down.

Again, this comes back to the context of "defensive hero".  I like Fastred a lot and I recognize Rossiel's weakness and have no quarrel with the idea that Fastred is a better *hero*, but I like Rossiel better as a *defender*.  My Rossiel decks are typically secrecy decks, so I mulligan for Out of the Wild and use that to setup Rossiel (typically for defense, though in quests with a starting location it may be for turn one willpower).  So she's often defending at 4/3 from turn one against most enemies, and that's solid defense.   That usage explains why Rossiel doesn't make the strongest VD decks, since you're powering up Rossiel with (likely) a weak card instead of taking out a nasty card and powering up Door Is Closed.  But getting an 8-threat hero to defend for 4 or quest for 4 in turn one is pretty cool and helps me get off to a good start.  Rossiel decks are neither the best victory display decks nor the best secrecy decks, but I find them fun for all that--they are certainly viable against non-nightmare quests.

Fastred is the bomb in the specific archtype of staging area attackers, which is a ton of fun -- but it also means that he's tied at the hip to a handful of heroes.  Without staging area attacks/damage (or a handful of quests where some enemies are important to un-engage) his ability is *terrible* for a defender, putting enemies back in staging to contribute threat and preventing you from attacking them.  Looking at him as a generic defender, he starts with a 1 def advantage, but Rossiel has an ability that will add to her defense while Fastred has an ability that actively works against combat.  He is also not eligible for most in-sphere defensive attachments.  If I grabbed two heroes at random and was choosing between Fastred and Rossiel to be hero-defender-when-needed, I'd usually go for Rossiel.  (Of course, it's likely I'd prefer one of the 3 def heroes *without* an explicit defensive ability over *either*.)

The one big advantage Fastred has as a generic defender -- and it is a big one -- is Warrior.  That doesn't help him in Spirit unless he's playing with SpBard, but Raiment of War is beautiful on him, buffing his defense and hp with one card.  Rossiel's eligible 2-cost tactics attachment gives her sentinel instead of +1 def, which is usually much less useful for a generic defender, though it does leave a restricted slot free (with the ABB nerf, that obviously becomes very important).

I see some bias here. You are praising Rossiel for her defensive ability in a narrow archetype that demands certain other heroes and support cards, then you turn around and criticize Fastred for that very reason.

We don't evaluate cards in a vacuum. Their usefulness depends on what other cards in the pool and what decks you can build with them. You bring up some cards that can get Rossiel to a conditional base of 4 defense in early game using some in-sphere cards (Out of the Wild mainly, Cloak of Lorien's +2 defense is way too unreliable), but neglect to mention that Fastred has in-sphere ways of getting to an unconditional base of 4 defense (Arwen and Mithril Shirt, both of which provide additional benefits).

Then there's the fact that Fastred seems to fit better in a deck with tactics access than Rossiel does (11% of Rossiel decks on RingsDB have tactics access, while 60% of Fastred decks do) which means he has easier access to cards like Gondorian Shield, Golden Shield, Raiment of War, Captain of Gondor. And nearly every Fastred deck that doesn't have Tactics access does have leadership access (far from the case for Rossiel decks, of which only 5% have leadership access), giving Fastred access to Dunedain Warning and Hauberk of Mail. It's not uncommon for my Fastred decks to have him defending multiple times for 6 or 7 by mid game.

Rossiel's biggest advantage over Fastred (apart from ABB) is access to healing. It's important, but an extra point of defense is worth a lot of healing over the course of the game.

Meanwhile, Fastred decks can handle the majority of nightmare quests.

I grant more latititude for deck space than hero selection.  There's now a wide variety of heroes that can be used with Rossiel in a secrecy deck (with Folco, practically anyone), but Dunhere is tied to a small number of heroes.

It's true that Rossiel's defense boost is conditional, but it's also built-in.  Cloak of Lorien is a conditional +2, but it's unconditionally +1 and doesn't take a restricted spot.  Fastred does have in-sphere access to Arwen and (when released) Mithril Shirt, both of which are great defensive cards (though Mithril Shirt has the guarded cost as well).  They also can be used on anyone, unlike ABB/Cloak.  Rossiel in a secrecy deck with a spirit hero has access to those defensive options, Fastred in a deck with Argalad not so much from the reverse.

It's true that Fastred finds himself with Tactics decks access, but that's a function of his partners -- LeEomer, Argalad and Dunhere all want weapons and TaBilbo is tactics already.  The same is true of leadership access via LeEomer.  That Fastred is used more often in the two spheres with the best defensive attachments is a function of his partners.  If both heroes were used in the same sphere configuration, Fastred has an advantage in that he's natively eligible for Hauberk, Captain, and Raiment (Golden Shields is terrible on him since it blocks Raiment IMO), but Dunedain Warning would benefit both equally.

I'm not surprised that you could get Fastred to multiple 6-7 defenses by mid game when you invest in his defense.   But it requires 4 cards to get to 7 plus additional cards for the readies.  A similar investment in Rossiel would produce a lower min defense but a higher max defense, meaning that if you ignored ABB access Fastred is more reliable -- but with ABB, I'll certainly take Rossiel *as a defender*.

I'm also not surprised that your Fastred decks can beat nightmare quests -- I've certainly found my Fastred decks with LeEomer and Dunhere more powerful than the Rossiel decks I've played.  But they weren't powerful because of Fastred's defense (good but fragile), nor were they powerful because his ability bolsters his defensive prowess (it doesn't).  His defense is only important as a trigger for his ability, which is the real thing that makes Fastred great in the few decks where the ability is useful.

I doubt we really disagree much about utility -- I'm not claiming Rossiel is a better hero than Fastred, you're not claiming Fastred is a good splash hero if you want a defender.

Wow ... seems i arrived after the battle !

The last errata and the lack of new release have completely erode my entertainement for the game. And i am not the only one in my game circle.

These errata is like the previous. Totally useless. If they make these errata due to competitive part introduce in last POD, it's a big mistake in my point of view.

I hate competitive game. I came to LOTR for cooperative deck building card game playable in solo. So i have to accept some errata for competitive variant ... NO WAY. It's a cooperative game, it doesn't need this kind of errata ... Unless the designer have a competitive mind.

These card are old and the most powerfull OP archetype or deck (like Elronds-deck, doomed deck, Outlands) continue to be untouched. So what's the meaning of touching to dwarf deck again ? Poor Erebor ally errated twice ... So like all previous errata, i will just ignore and now just use the text of the card.

I like the discussion with the community ... But now, i feel like playing a different game because we don't have the same rules.

You play with the original text of Beravor and Zigil Miner? Without errata, some cards are too powerful for me to even have fun playing. So I'm glad we have errata to that I can actually use them in my decks.

And you play with the original Blocking Wargs?

As for enjoyment of the game, most people I talk to think the game has been getting better overall as time goes on, even despite the errata. People that dropped out after the Boromir/Caldara/Hama nerfs would have missed out on the amazing Haradrim and Ered Mithin cycles.

I just started playing in late 2017. Did Beravor used to have no limit to card draw? That would have been bonkers to play with all the readying effects these days...

The errata on Beravor and Zigil Miner wasn't done many years later.

For Beravor, you can up the limit of her capacity to two time now ... With Erestor, Galdor & Co, she is ridiculously under powered.

For Miner Zigil, it's a design issue quickly discover and fix. I'm ok with that.

These new errata come five years after release. And for the two concerning the dwarves, it make no sense because some other tribal archetype was already better (by far) from dwarves. So why decrease their power after nerf on We are not idle ? Noldor is just crazy, they crush scenario before The battle master as any chance to be view as OP ... Same for Outlands. When i compare Noldor capacity draw to dwarf, i don't find old legacy of durin totally OP ... just ok and again Noldor continue to be better for this job.

The comparison with encounter cards has no sense. Blocking wargs was a bug as many other encounter cards. I have no complain with these errata. But i think that nightmare is a better fix than errata (especially for cycle 3).

And last, i don't find Ered Mithin cycle amazing. I found it bad for scenario and great for player card. And Haradrim just ok. Just a point of view not the truth for everybody.

I would prefer that designer work on more new mechanics and player cards. I would prefer new release that this kind of useless errata. The lack of new content hurt a lot.

I continue to think that Gandalf Hero is OP and Elrond + Vilya also. The best deck with an incredible ratio on NM are with these kind of heroes not the dwarf. And we see errata on dwarf. Outlands with Erestor literally destroyed most of the powerfull scenario. And we see Errata on burning brand.

So you can find it good for the game. Great designer have done a good job for some people. They do a great job for new mechanich, new player cards (Radagast is a great hero). For errata, i think that the job isn't correctly done by far on player card since the last three FAQ on the game. I ignore player errata since the nerf of Horn of Gondor.

Sure! Although hidden ways don’t cover a multiplayer game. I want to see a deck with Elrond + Vilya, Erkenbrand and a third hero that abuses that combo, in order to nullify combat. I am working on it, but I am not a great deck builder.

Ok so the problem is the delay between the release and the errata. That wasn't clear from your original comment. I'm just curious, do you have a time limit for when errata are acceptable, and beyond that you ignore them, or do you evaluate each errata on a case-by-case basis?

The Out of the Wild errata came out a long time after the card's release, but nobody complained as it's arguably a buff for the card, so I'm curious if you follow that one or not.

I actually don't disagree with most of your comments. I also think the Ered Mithrin cycle had the best player cards in a long time, while the Harad and Angmar Awakened quests remain my favorite. And I agree that Vilya and Outlands are overpowered, but I can see a good explanation for why that might be intended (Vilya, thematically, should be the strongest attachment in Middle-earth apart from the One Ring, and Outlands were designed for new players to feel powerful without a lot of deckbuilding).

One thing often ignored in the errata discussion is that we don't have the same picture of the card pool that the developer has. The game is developed years in advance. I wouldn't be surprised if the stuff they are playtesting right now won't even come out until 2021. So it could very well be that Caleb has already designed some more Dwarf cards, but they would make Dwarves way more powerful than the already are, so we are seeing some nerfs to old (and frankly overpowered) cards like Legacy of Durin. In the end, the errata may make room for more design space in the Dwarf swarm archtype that would make them fun to play again (I am tired of that mechanic myself). I would gladly take a hit on a couple cards, regardless of their age, if it allows an archetype to grow and become more interesting to play.

Meanwhile, maybe Noldor and Outlands will not see much development in the coming years, so he is leaving their power level alone (this is obviously all conjecture, as I am not a playtester).

My point is, if you've been playing this game for the last 5 years, you clearly must think Caleb is a good game designer, and has done a good job of piloting this ship we've all been on. When I see a content announcement, it is easy for me to trust that the new cards will be a good fit for the future card pool, given Caleb's track record. Now, why should the trust in his future vision stop at level of creating new content and not include the adjustment of current content? Who knows better where this ship is headed?

The rationale you find for the Outlands could be applied to any archetype, really. Why the dwarf swarm archetype would be different? Plus, the Outlands archetype does the same as a dwarf swarm archetype just faster and better. In your case, more than 25% of the decks you have published in Ringsdb use some sort of outland ally (typically Ethir and Anfalas). I guess you are not tired of this mechanic, but there are people who would like to see an errata on the outlands archetypem because frankly, they are reeeeally overpowered. Shall Caleb errate them?

The new Elvenking + Galadhrim Weaver combo shall be errated? Because Hama was errated to 3 time per game to avoid recurring events like fient and thicket of spears.

I, my self, am tired and bored of seeing decks with steward of gondor (which you use in about 50% of the decks you have published in Ringsdb), which is one of the most overpowered cards in the game. Shall it get an errata in order to make the game more challenging?

My answer to all of these questions is No. It is a collaborative game (and I hope it stays like this). There is really no need to make erratas, with the exception may be of those combos that create loops of infinite resources, card drawing and so on, which by the way they are not all corrected, you have a two-deck fellowship that generates infinite resources! Even in this case, a list of suggested erratas, like in Arkham Horror, is a more friendly way to go than an imposed errata appearing in the reprinted cards.

Ok, that is but my opinion which is obviously not shared by the developers 😀

And yes, I, like you, have full trust on Caleb game design skills.

Because in this case, the developers have stated their intention. On various podcasts Caleb has said that Outlands was designed for new players and for people who dislike deckbuilding to still be able to have a good time playing the game.

No, I think Outlands is supposed to be overpowered, as I said above. Just because some people want an errata is not enough reason to issue one, in the same way that just because some people don't want an errata is not enough reason for them not to issue one. It's the developer's decision.

The Weaver combo you're talking about requires an empty deck, which comes with a significant setup cost and maintenance penalty, unlike Hama. I don't see how these are comparable.

The idea of an errata for Steward has been brought up many times before. If I recall correctly, Caleb's stance (so far) has been that it is essential for new players to help them through the core set and first few cycles, so he is not inclined to nerf it.

What if Legacy of Durin creates an infinite loop with some future card that is designed but not yet released? Would you prefer to have the errata come pre-emptively, or wait until after it's released and the community has had some time to exploit it?

I have some problems with the Arkham Horror "taboo list" concept, but that is a whole other discussion.

1) Sorry to say but the Outlands argument that Caleb wields is pathetic (I was not aware of it), still it does not justify why it cannot be the same treatment for dwarfs?

2) For the combo of Elven King + Galadhrim weaver you need to empty your deck (or have recurrent powerful scrying like Mirror of Galadriel). How many rounds do you need to empty your deck with Sp Dain? With Dain and Erestor? That is how they are comparable.

3) I really love the argument on Steward of Gondor!

4) Regarding the errata of the Legacy of Durin, I definitively would prefer to see this "infinite combo" before the errata comes. All this pre-emptive errata give me the shivers, bad things have been done in the name of "pre-emptiveness". Besides, there is already a loop for infinite resources that you have created, will it get an errata?

But it is really a pointless discussion. Caleb will keep doing erratas, somo of us don't (and won't) like that the erratas are forced on us through re-prints, but they will keep coming.

I still don't like any errata, just spoils the game especially as my wife and group and I are newer players and we find it hard enough without knocking down the few really good cards that have helped us scrape by. We don't have all the cards and I'm the only one that enjoys a challenging design/battle. Most of the players want to just sit and play something without having to feel bad that they are playing "the wrong way" or "cheating" let alone trying to remember all of the existing errata on cards. Therefore we don't use them and yet we still have a fun time, we are only able to do this because I managed to find pre-errata packs which I'm very grateful for.

I feel bad for brand new players that are buying the errated packs as they are going to have a lot harder time with getting started having to used toned down critical cards through the hardest scenarios.

Has anyone tried a progression style Carn Dum with the new Burning Brand and/or Boromir rules? Same question for Black Gate Opens and Mount Doom. 

I agree with yepesnopes that a special banned or temporary errated list would have been much better for the "competitive tournaments" so that the more hardcore players can have that challenge and be regulated that way. While still allowing new journeyers like myself and many others the opportunity to have the full card pool without having nerfed cards forced on us while other players had the ability to use the "Broken cards" to help save them through the hardest quests.

In the name of balance it kind of comes across as favoring longer time players who have the whole card pool and already have years of playing the errated cards the original way and screwing over/making new players feel bad even if they don't want to use forced on them errata.

@Seastan has beaten Carn Dûm with only the adventure Pack, Lost Realm and a single Core Set, albeit in easy mode.

Yes. There are more ways of beating Carn Dum than Boromir with Burning Brand, they're just not as obvious.

And yet, progression style Carn Dum is a walk in the park compared to progression style (solo) Escape from Dol Guldur, so is the issue here really Burning Brand? Some quests are just incredibly difficult, and I don't see the problem with that. Not every quest should be designed such that a casual player can beat it after a couple tries. If they were, there'd be no point in having an easy mode.

For Carn Dum it totally is, Burning Brand is essential and we played it dozens of times with different decks and the only thing that worked for us with our card pool was Boromir and Burning Brand. I would be very curious to see what progression decks you think can have a reasonable chance at beating it without Burning Brand.

And my point is that both of those things are solid choices to take on some of the hardest scenarios in the game so they can actually be beat by casual players. Especially when people such as yourself who has been playing longer used those cards for the same quest at some point as well. 

If your reasoning is there are hard quests and they shouldn't be possible to beat unless played on easy mode or with a specific card combination/deck build that's not a great answer and kills the fun for many of us.

You can always impose yourself the challenge of building decks without certain powerful cards like SoG, ABB, AToW, UC...( I myself avoid SoG as much as possible), while other players may have fun using them always. In this situation both sort of players are happy.

If you start adding erratas and forcing them by reprinting the cads, you eliminate one of the above two options and frustrate a group of players. Needed? Worth it?

Yes.  Both needed and worth it.

Because overpowered cards are unhealthy for the game, regardless of whether or not it is competitive. Just by existing, they warp the meta and restrict the design space.

Errata to op cards relieves those restrictions. It makes it possible for the designers to build new cards in the space that got opened up. Burning brand made it so that almost no lore shadow management was ever possible again.  It also made it so that no powerful lore defender could ever be released, because the combo was too powerful. When used, it  often completely trivialized the entire combat phase.

Now, there's room for other lore shadow management, and even room for a pretty good lore defender. The game is now better.

Legacy of Durin allowed infinite card draw. By its very nature, unlimited effects are unbalanced and will eventually find themselves part of an infinite loop.

I'm not saying that all the errata that's ever been done has been right, but I think errata for op cards is important, even in a coop game

But logically this doesn't follow. If I am unable to win without X, it does not prove X is essential to victory, as it may be possible to win with some Y which I have not tried.

I was able to beat this quest in easy mode using only player cards a single Core Set, The Lost Realm, and the Carn Dum AP. The deck and video are here [http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/5756/minimum-purchase-the-battle-of-carn-dm-1.0]. This is obviously way more restrictive than true progression mode, which would grant me access to almost 5 full cycles of player cards. I am quite certain that with all those options I could improve the deck to the point where it can handle standard difficulty.

Why must every quest in this game beatable by a casual player with a limited cardpool at the standard difficulty, when that's the exact use case that easy mode was made for?

Does psychological toll of knowing you're playing on "easy" mode take the the fun away for you? I'm sorry if this is the case. But if the game were such that every quest, at normal difficulty, could be handily beaten by a casual player with a limited cardpool, it would take away the fun for many, many more people. People that would be left wondering why FFG went to the trouble of printing gold rings on certain encounter cards, since no one ever needs to take them out.

Again, why all this angst over a single quest? There are over 100 other quests that are not Carn Dum. Some of them are so easy that I get no enjoyment out of playing them. But I don't complain about them. I don't try to argue that player cards should be weaker so that those quests can be played at a difficulty level that I find fun. I just accept that with over 100 quests, not all of them are going to be my cup of tea. So ignore them and play a quest I enjoy. Which is easy because again, there are over 100 of them.

This is totally false. The true statement is the following: The game is now better FOR YOU.

I am glad you feel like this, and that you have found a way to justify the erratas. I am sure there are others that feel the game is better now, but there are other who feel the game is worse now, and it is every time erratas appear.

At least in something we agree, I also think that not all the errata that's ever been done has been right :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] 

Jokes apart, I also understand that some erratas were needed. Like Horn of Gondor that would make Silvan decks unplayable. But man, they fail badly with this errata.

This weekend we started playind The Voice of Isengard. It is a **** of a cicle in multiplayer. We were playing with Erkenbrand as main defender to asses the impact of the new errata on A Burning Brand. It was really tough but we managed so far until the Dunland Trap. I wonder though how one would beat those scenarios if Unexpected Courage would get errated, specially the Dunland Trap.

I an sure one can make specific decks for each scenario, but most people don’t have the time for that. I think that is a playing style that should be left for nughtmare mode only.

I like your version better or else in solo Rhovanion Outrider would just be a better and cheaper norther tracker. At least with your restriction the extra cost would be somewhat justified , and as a new player that thinks that sometimes the game is too hard... I actually dont mind that rule on northern tracker. I remember when playing Journey down the Aduin (however you spell it lol) all location build ups would just get nuked by this guy and make locations trivial. With x being 1 more than the number of players he's still great and would get the players involved (mentally active) in where they should place progress tokens if there are too many of them.

Fantastic sideboard card reduced to a questionable sideboard card.  Why do the designers hate new progression players so?

Strider's Path isn't strictly better than Thror's Map with this revision, but it's close.  And having a unique symbol on a disposable attachment seems pretty pointless.

There is no abandon of the concept of Travel cost, there is no opening new deck building possibilities, there is not even a broken card (map gets errated but Northern tracker does not?) There are 6 packs left. There are only new erratas.

If needed, I'd prefer a change that increases the cost but preserves the general usage, e.g.

Discard a card from your hand to...

Pay 1 resource to...

Return Thror's Map to your hand to...

Attach to the main quest.

Exhaust attached hero to...

Raise each player's threat by 1 to...

But tbh I don't see the need to make the change at all.

Im so glad to see this change. A simple 1 cost repeatable effect that completely avoids travel costs is overpowered and poor design. Look at the second quest from Shadow in the East; Thrors map completely breaks that quest.

I'm looking athe second quest from Shadow in the East.  If you have Thror's Map (requires playing Lore), you can avoid the following travel effects:

1) Hillside Manor -- random discard from hand

2) City Forum -- raise threat 1 per each resource on it (gets resources only when active location is explored)

3) Side Street -- replacement location from deck added

4) Catacombs -- each discard card from encounter deck, if enemy it is engaged.

Catacombs scales against more players, but 3+ players means location control is already a priority and there's only two in deck.  Side Street seems nasty and is required at game start -- but you advance in the quest by exploring *active* locations -- ensuring another location to travel to next turn can actually help the player.  City Forum's only raises by 1 if you go there first chance.  Hillside Manor just discards a random card.  These are annoying effects that would make packing Thror's Map worth including in a deck, if you're playing Lore, which isn't true for a lot of quests.  But those aren't *remotely* game-losing effects that cause the quest to be broken if you somehow avoid them.  If playing Lore I'd add Thror's Map, but I certainly wouldn't mulligan for it.

Now it's certainly true that Thror's Map is a cheap repeatable way of avoiding travel costs, which is exactly what it was designed to be and what it was long-ago errata-ed to be.  You may correctly say that the existence of Thror's Map reduces the popularity of Strider's Path, or that it precludes a lesser, non-repeatable travel avoider or a more expensive travel avoider.

But here's the thing -- look at those travel effects again.  Is it worth a deck slot *and* a lore resource to avoid one of those effects?  I don't think so.  Lesser cards are blocked not by Thror's Map because they are lesser, but because they are inherently weak. Thror's Map was a useful sideboard card for literally years; now it is a coaster.  And for what?  So you can rejoice in the moral purity of a quest where a tool is taken away to control what happens?  So you can deprive *other players* of a card you yourself were *never* required to play?  So players with a limited card pool starting the game late in his life -- the people who are currently getting this card that veterans got many years ago -- have one less arrow in the quiver?  So the exciting world of forced travel effects can be opened up for the whopping six remaining known quests, as if there weren't past quests featuring obnoxious "Forced: when X becomes the active location" when experiencing travel effects was *actually* "necessary"?

I appreciate that the designers have to errata card sometimes to remove "broken" combos that a single player could induce in pick-up multiplayer, though I've always advocated that such fixes should be designed to preserve the common usage of a card.  I totally reject the idea that the designers should, years later, deside to nerf non-broken powerful cards to protect the integrity of quests from players.  *That's* what I call bad design.

If they were going to make it so useless, the least they could've done is attach it to the location when used, so that the woodmen could get powered up.

@dalestephenson [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/256741-dalestephenson/]

You got a little hung up on my example of why the map is too good. Danger in Dorwinion is just one example.

The map definitely shut down design space because of its existence and it made cards like striders path not as useful. Its repeatable nature and low cost was too good and I have always tried to avoid using it. Why? Because it just isnt that fun to ignore every travel cost in the game with this.

The Harad cycle brought a lot of locations with forced effects ( as Seastan mentioned) and I believe the existence of thrors map was the reason. 

Its still a good card, and certainly not a coaster. Off the top of my head I can think of a few locations that make you reveal a card to travel there. Discarding the map is totally worth cancelling that, and you dont need to have a resource on hand to do it.

 

## 303 [dalestephenson on September 11, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/294624-different-cards-with-the-new-reprint/?do=findComment&comment=3782411)

I focused on Danger in Dorwinion because you claimed Thror's Map "completely breaks the quest".  It doesn't.  It does have travel effects on everything, so it's certainly a quest where Thror's Map is attractive.  But it's also a quest where avoiding travel effects when travelling doesn't immunize you from travel effects, since shadows and treacheries invoke the active location.  And it's a quest where you can't always use the *other* way of avoiding travel effects (exploring in staging area), because you have to clear active locations to advance.  By clever design, they've made travel effects noticeable even if you have both Thror's Map and an army of Northern Trackers.

There is no other quest in existence that Thror's Map breaks -- avoiding travel effects just isn't that powerful.  Mind you, I don't think the existence of a quest that a player card *actually* breaks is a good reason to errata a player card.  It's just a good reason not to play the card against that quest.

Yes, Thror's Map made Strider's Path less useful -- but Strider's Path isn't *that* popular even with progression players, and the big win with Strider's Path isn't avoiding travel effects, it's getting high-threat locations out of staging before the quest resolves, especially when there's no active location.  The original Thror's Map did squash that use, but was errata-ed quickly to be a travel action.  Since then, Strider's Path does something that Thror's Map can't.  So does Thror's Key, West Road Traveler, Mariner's Compass, South Away, Hidden Way and Distant Stars, all of which can make an active location while avoiding travel effects (Mariner's Compass is even repeatable).  Add to that the many cards that can place progress in staging and it's hard to see that Thror's Map has closed off any "design space" except for cheap repeatable travel avoidance in Lore -- and you can't fill that space now without recreating Thror's Map as it is.  What's the point?

It's nice for you that you can now use a weaker card because you couldn't enjoy the overpowered awesomeness of avoiding the occasional travel effect.  But this was a card that was popular in a lot of people's sideboard, so your gain comes at someone else's expense.  And as is usually the case when we see erratas as straight nerfs, the card will be less-used post-errata than it was before, making it a net loss to the community.

And thematically, it's still odd to make a unique attachment be a one-shot.

May be someone can enlighten me and discuss why a card such as Thror’s Map, with little presence in decks (ringsdb) gets an errata (still to be officially confirmed) while Northern Tracker does not?

I wonder why worry now, before an undefinedly long break, with new errated cards such as the ones we have seen (I insist they have not been officially confirmed yet)? I mean, if the game is going to have a break, why not waiting to discuss how the game will continue (if it continues) before errating cards? Have more time for testing... and will the game have a new team of designers?

To me, it is a strange choice that the developers release erratas of cards which do not break the game just when there are but 6 packs to come. Will they as well during the "break" release erratas for the cards that appear on those packs?

Because Thror's Map trivializes a specific facet of the game, while Northern Tracker is simply overpowered. Thror's Map basically made Travel effects a non-factor, which greatly restricts design space. The developers had to design every travel effect with Thror's Map in mind.

Northern Tracker meanwhile, doesn't mess with the meta so much. It's just really good. Take Unexpected Courage as an example. It doesn't affect the developers approach to designing cards per se. It's just ridiculously good.

It's the same reason A Burning Brand got errataed as well: the card lets you ignore a certain core aspect of the game indefinetely for only a small investment. That would be like Eleanor without revealing a replacement card or Galadriel's action being unlimited.

I understand your point, which could be a valid point back in 2012.

Now, if Thror’s Map gets errated, are we going to see new  locations’ traveling designs? Like, for the next 6 adventure packs...? Is it relevant?

On the other hand, NT trivializes all locations, no matter if they have a travelling effect or not.

I don’t understand, why at the end of the game’s life, anyone would go for such an errata.

Like I said before it could be an pre-emptive move for the "next iteration"

In that case, would not it make more sense to wait until such a new iteration is more tangible?

As I see it, errating Thror’s Map in this precise moment makes NT, Asfaloth and company even more appealing.

Just as a reference, las weekend I was in Llinars, for a LotR lcg tournament. We were 39 participants. Games are played in 3 player mode. You don’t know with whom will you play beforehand. Over the weekend, I saw Thror’s map only in two decks. Don’t get me started on the number of NTs and Mirkwood Explorers I saw.

In anycase, I would not be convinced about an errata on Thror’s map as a necessary thing in the current stage of the game. At the same time, the concept of “pre-emptive” give me the  heebie-jeebies, USA has done already far too many wrong things for the sake of being “pre-emptive”.

Man, I like the card too, but I want to be in this meta where Mirkwood Explorer is a super-common sight! No one but me wants to play it around here.

I love Mirkwood Explorer.  Especially with Leather Boots on.  Let's see you nuke newly revealed locations, you lame Northern Trackers.

Seriously, while Thror's Map "trivializes" location travel effects, so does location control *in general*, which is already a multiplayer staple.  This is why the errata is particularly damaging -- Thror's map was so good at travel effects because *all* it did was avoid travel effects.  Every other way of avoiding travel effects in the game isn't limited to just nerfing the travel effect.

But in this case the problem is the game mechanic itself: While it is possible to reveal more than one location per round in higher player counts, the players still can only travel to one of them, whereas enemies can be engaged more or less at will. And as long as one does not plan to build decks that can provide more willpower than the threat of all locations in the encounter deck AND that can deal with more treacheries and enemies than usual, location control is an important aspect of the game to cover.

And by the way, Mariner's Compass does not make an active location, it just allows you to replace a location in the staging are with no guarantee for success.

True, Mariner's Compass doesn't directly make an active location, but since it allows you to swap a location in staging out immediately before you travel, it's a viable method of avoiding obnoxious travel effects.  Yes, it may whiff.  In quests where locaitons are 1/3rd of the deck, it should whiff about one time in seven.  (Of course, in a quest like Danger in Dorwinion you will end up with a different travel effect instead of no travel effect.)

I'm not calling for the end of location control in staging to ensure that players experience the "core mechanic" of experiencing obnoxious travel requirements.  I don't think it's a "core mechanic", just one more possible annoyance in a game chock-full of them.  Drawing Thror's Map (non-errata-ed) may avoid any future travel effects, but it's also not drawing a card that could you help in all those other aspects of the game.  The card broke no quests and was part of no game-breaking combos.  Some players will prefer the new version; others (more numerous, I believe) will prefer the old), but it was not in any sense *necessary*.

I dont plan to argue long over this, I understand that you feel the way you do.

But the designers didn't decide to give this card errata because it was underpowered. And lets be honest; Caleb and the team know better than you or me what is best for this game. I trust them and appretiate their work, as Im sure you do as well.

Im also not sold that more people like the old card as you say, there are several members on this forum that have expressed otherwise.

I've been staying out of this discussion because it's kinda not very productive, but I do want to address this.

Thror's Map, before this errata, was an excessively powerful card and a top choice for efficiently beating quests. Despite that fact, for the most part I've very deliberately avoided using it in my decks for The Line Unbroken because it completely negates a core game mechanic and thus gives a really skewed perspective on the quests.

Now, I will be quite willing to use it freely. I'm way happier with this version.

I'm in the "Just leave it be" camp on this issue. I have played with TM plenty of times and I never felt that the card's effects adversely affected my enjoyment of the game, or the challenge offered by the Encounter deck. It provided some welcome theme with an ability that makes sense only if it is recursive. (It's a map; you don't throw it away after using it once!)

That being said, this is a cooperative game, not a competitive one. If I met someone at Gencon and she/he were playing pre-FAQ Boromir, I might say something to them afterwards, but I would absolutely let them play with the ability as it is printed. The game state where one has to ask "Which version of [Card X] are you playing?" is not the result of player dissatisfaction, but, rather, a struggling design process. One could argue that players benefit from the changes with the additional design space that they offer, but I would consider that a paltry return for the maintenance of keeping up with the latest card text. If my play group wants to adopt this interpretation, I will follow suit. However, I'm happy playing it as it was designed. This is only an opinion, just like anyone else's in this thread, so take it with a grain of salt.

PocketWraith, are you the same as Warden of Arnor on ringsdb?  He has 15 Line Unbroken decks with Thror's Map in it, the most recent from just two weeks ago.  I've only got one listed (a stereotypical deck -- early Vilya), but that's because the search doesn't pick up on sideboard cards.  I think sideboards would considerably boost Thror's Map presence at ringsdb, since it's very much a sideboard card.

But as is, Thror's Map is in 15 pages of decks at ringsdb.  Thror's Key is in 12 pages.  Secret Paths is in 31 pages.  Being able to completely negate "a core game mechanic" wasn't enough for Thror's Map to become ubiquitous, simply because said "core game mechanic" just isn't that important.  Secret Paths isn't always as good as Thror's Map for avoiding travel effects (though sometimes it's better), but it's also useful even in quests that have few or no travel effects.

I can't rule out that the players who were avoiding it because of its power, and now consider the nerfed card more interesting and playable, outnumber those who thought the old card was fine and play it less or not at all in its new incarnation.  But this isn't the first power-nerf errata that's come our way in the past few years, and all of those had posters applauding the change as well.  TaBoromir/Caldara/TaHama decks still dropped like rocks after the change, and only in Hama's case (Gwaihir's Debt) has there been any subsequent card that makes me think the errata actually was "necessary" to avoid a broken combo.  I'll place my bet on making a card less powerful makes it less used.

MikeGracey, I trust the designers to develop new cards and quests.  I think the Ered Mithrin cycle was amazing both in the archtypes created and enhanced.  My favorite new cards are ones that make old cards better.  I also trust them to design quests that aren't broken by years-old-cards that have coexisted with a hundred quests before now.  They've got an excellent track record there.

They've also got a track record with errata, so I don't trust them there.  It's a history of cards where they didn't preserve the common case when breaking extreme combos, and more recently straight-up nerfing of useful cards that broke no quests and are from cycles with a lot of dud cards.  Things are harder for a progression player now, thanks to the nerfs, and it's hard for me to see how that's "good for the game", especially with an impending hiatus.

Even well-thought out, sensible, and necessary errata imposes a cost, in terms of remembering errata, mixing the printed versions in the player card pool, and impacting published decks.

Count me in as one who felt that the card needed an errata. In fact, I was almost certain that we were going to add it to the nerf list for the Ancient Mathoms project.

This particular errata still leaves the card useable, but I think that we are seeing the limitations of FFG's errata model, where they never touch costs. This card is playable at 1, but with the discard effect should probably only cost 0.

So in a funny/slightly ironic, I think that the Ancient Mathoms project went from wanting to nerf it to deciding to boost it a little (likely either by having it give the attached hero +1 willpower or reducing the cost to 0).
