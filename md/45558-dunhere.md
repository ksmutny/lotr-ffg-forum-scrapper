# [Dunhere?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45558-dunhere/)

Dunhere's ability reads:

Dunhere can target enemies in the staging area when he attacks alone. When doing so, he gets +1 Combat.

Silly question but when does he use this ability? I assume this is when he engages an enemy at the start of the engagement phase?

Thanks.

No, this would be when the time comes to attack enemies, i.e. after they've attacked you in the Combat phase. Dunhere can then declare an attack against an enemy in the SA.

## 3 [Eryx_UK on April 21, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45558-dunhere/?do=findComment&comment=456945)

That makes more sense. Thank you.

Even better - when you have some resources this ability can be devastating.

Lets assume Marsh Adder Engages You. U play 2resources to play Light in the Dark, then hit him, than if You have Unexpected Courage you can exhaust it to attack it second time. In one turn You did hit it for 4damage,

Hey

I still got some questions about this card.

This is how we play it:

Dunhere can if the player wishes preattack on 1 enemy on the staging area.

This happen before the engagement checks in the encounter phase.

After Dunhere has attacked (enemy does not attack, so no defense needed), we exhaust (tab) Dunhere, so he can't attack again this round.

After that if the enemy isn't killed yet, the engagement checks are made and the enamy can attack a player (so that round, that enemy can be attacked twice)

 

Is this correct?

I don't think there is anything in the rules or card to suggest that Dunhere attacks before engagement checks are made. I think Dunhere is supposed to attack at the same time all other heroes attack, the only difference being that he can target enemies in the staging area in addition to those already engaged with the Heroes

Why can you attack again with Dunhere a second time? I thought each Player can only attack each enemy once each turn. Dunhere's ability doesn't grant him a second attack. Just that he can additionally target enemies that are not engaged with the Player yet, as Pumpkin nicely described.

Hey pumkin

Something doesn't sound right.

What is the perpose of that card if it's after the engaging chack phase?

Because the engaging check phase say you need to engage all the enemy's in the staging area.

So after the engaging check are done,  there aren't any enemy's in the staging area left.

Or am I wrong here?

I think you are wrong, you certainly do NOT engage all enemies in the staging area.

Each player may choose to engage ONE enemy.

Then you do engagement CHECKS to see if any of them engage you.  If your threat isnt too high, there will still be enemies in the Staging Area.

## 10 [mason240 on April 24, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45558-dunhere/?do=findComment&comment=458369)

 This is how Dunhere works:

During the engage phase, engage all enemies as usual. Suppose you get to the combat phase and, after the engaged enemies attack, there still an enemy left in the staging area (meaning it was not optionally engaged AND it had an enagment cost higher then all the players). 

Once it is the players turn to attack, Dunhere can attack an enemy in the staging area. His ability seems to be th most effective against Goblin Sniper (48).

## 11 [qwertyuiop on April 24, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45558-dunhere/?do=findComment&comment=458392)

 His ability is effective against anything except East Bight Patrol and Dol Guldur Orcs as far as I've seen.  Threat Reduction is awesome that way.

@Sky.  Unexpected Courage on Dunhere is super great.  Normally, a player can only attack an enemy he is engaged with once per turn. Since Dunhere doesn't have to engage the enemy in order to attack via the staging area, this is a great combo.  It's not game breaking, but I wonder if it will get FAQ/errata treatment in the future.

## 12 [Severon7 on July 21, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45558-dunhere/?do=findComment&comment=502585)

Oh yes it is game breaking.

 

I just played the standard Spirit deck. Basically I finished the game when I had accumulated -99 threat (adding victory points I had -108). However it was the first scenario and I could have gone on forever. Dunhere killing everything in the staging area exept Brood of Ungoliant, which I kept there with 8 damage markers. With all allies in play and 15+ cards on hand the likelyhood of drawing welcome of the Galadrim, Gandalf or Dwarven Grave becomes staggering. All used for downgrading threat I just had to wait until my treat dial couldn't take any more and the two cards with victory points got killed (had to play through the shadow deck three times). So the final score was -99 +0 (hero damage) -5 -4 (victory) = -108

## 13 [Veybo on July 21, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45558-dunhere/?do=findComment&comment=502653)

I see some of the posts in this thread probably came out before the FAQ was released, but according to that I don't believe Dunhere can attack the same enemy in the Staging area more than once in the same turn.

From the FAQ v1.1 -

"When a player is the active attacker during the combat
phase, the game rules grant him the option to declare
1 attack against each enemy with which he is engaged.
If, through card effects such as ranged, a player is able
to declare attacks against enemies with which he is
not engaged, he is still only permitted a single attack
against each of these enemies."

Whilst Dunhere can attack enemies in the Staging area due to his ability, his card text says nothing about it being a special case attack (unlike Quick Strike).

"Dunhere can target enemies in the staging area when he attacks alone. When doing so, he gets +1."
 

Therefore I believe (as much as I wish it wasn't that case) that Dunhere can only attack each enemy in the Staging area once per turn.

I don't think that threat can drop below zero.

How does people keep getting these low threats?

Which cards lowers threat?

Currently, Galadhrim's Greeting and Gandalf.

And, by extension, Dwarven Tomb, Stand and Fight and Sneak Attack.

Wandering Took can also help, in a strange way.

That's true.  Keep in mind that it doesn't help when playing solo, and it doesn't change the overall score.

Sure, not a solo thing. There is a possibility of advantage in a coop final score though. We had a nice example the other night. Two players both on 30 during the Anduin quest whilst having the Galdadhrim's Greeting at hand. Normally I would play it on both players (we didn't want to engage the troll yet) and lower each by 2. With the Wandering Took though, I lowered my threat by 6 and my fiancee gave me control of the Took (which was also beneficial engagement-wise). It was a satisfactory feeling.

That is a nice combo.  I was talking about Wandering Took as an individual card, but in situations like I can see how it's ability can be very useful.

## 22 [Gilesderby on July 23, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45558-dunhere/?do=findComment&comment=503143)

 Is there an infinite loop you can generate to get to -99 threat?  I would have thought you would run out of cards eventually. Is it something like three gandalfs = -15, three greetings = -18, repeat gandalfs with sneak attack = another -15, repeat greetings with dwarven tomb = another -18?

 

## 23 [Shelfwear on July 23, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45558-dunhere/?do=findComment&comment=503153)

Stand and Fight (3x) to return Gandalf from "the Grave" and then you have up to three Will of the West to reshuffle all those cards mentioned back into your deck to continue your threat reduction marathon :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] Theoretically you can establish an infinite loop as long as you keep at least one Will of the West in your deck or hand without discarding it. (they are not removed from play)

## 24 [lleimmoen on July 23, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45558-dunhere/?do=findComment&comment=503185)

I believe Threat never goes below 0 which is the lowest number on the dial. Thematically, it only makes sense that there are no negative Threat figures. The overall score can go below 0 though.
