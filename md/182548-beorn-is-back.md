> Solo-play in the LotR:LCG is increasingly becoming a... "challenging" enterprise these days (other terms used to describe solo-questing against the latest quests include "maddening", "frustrating", and "aggravating" - among others). More and more I find myself eschewing thematic decks in favor of powerful decks that can simply fight and quest their way through tough these scenarios.

I am in agreement with you. I usually build for theme. I love keeping likes together. I hat having a bit of every race and card in my deck (i.e. Rohan, dwarves, gondor, elves all in one deck) but I find that when I build decks that way, they are stronger. Beorn is just a beast (no pun intended!) He is awesome, but having no willpower means you have to start with higher cost heroes who make up for that, and so your starting threat is high. Or you can play lower cost higher willpower allies early in the game to build up a good questing force. 

 

Happy Gaming!

Good write up by the way! I still don't own that Honor Guard! I want him though. He's insanely good.
