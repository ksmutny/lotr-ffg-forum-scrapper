Elfhelm's text reads:

While Elfhelm is ready, he gains:
"Response: After your threat is raised as the result of questing unsuccessfully, or by an encounter or quest card effect, reduce your threat by 1."'

Zigil Mineshaft's text reads:

 Action: Raise each player's threat by 1 to place 1 progress token on Zigil Mineshaft.

So couldn't you just raise your threat by 1, have Elfhelm lower it by 1, and continue until you have fully explored Zigil Mineshaft?

Thanks

Sorry, this won't work because "Raise each player's threat by 1" is a cost, not an effect. "place 1 progress token on Zigil Mineshaft" is the effect.

Rulebook page 25:

Paying Costs

Many cards are written in a “pay or exhaust X to do 
Y” manner. When confronted with such a construct, 
everything before the word “to” is considered the cost, 
and everything after the word “to” is considered an 
effect

Oh! Okay. Thanks for the clarification.
