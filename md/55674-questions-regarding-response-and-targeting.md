# [Questions Regarding *Response* and Targeting](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55674-questions-regarding-response-and-targeting/)

Reponses:

When do they need to be decided?  For example, does the Player with Aragorn have to decide immediately following the Questing Phase if they want to pay 1 Resource and ready him or can they wait and do it at any time during the round?

 

When a Son of Arnor or Dunhere want to Attack an enemy in the Staging Area does that enemy also receive their usual Attack and Shadow Card or not?

 

The Forest Spider has a Forced Effect that reads something like "When the enemy is engaged...it gains a +1 to Attack..." or something similiar to that.  Does that mean IF the Forest Spider engaged the player by its own free will (as in no player engaged it so it HAS TO engage a player) or does that mean while its engaged with a player it gains +1 to Attack.  If it's the latter then what's the point of the effect?  Why not simply give it NO effect and an Attack of 3?

 

I appreciate everyone's help!

"Reponses:

Responses must be triggered immediately. You cannot wait.

 

"When a Son of Arnor or Dunhere want to Attack an enemy in the Staging Area does that enemy also receive their usual Attack and Shadow Card or not?"

No. The enemy does not get to attack nor do they receive a shadow card.

 

"The Forest Spider has a Forced Effect that reads something like "When the enemy is engaged...it gains a +1 to Attack..." or something similiar to that. Does that mean IF the Forest Spider engaged the player by its own free will (as in no player engaged it so it HAS TO engage a player) or does that mean while its engaged with a player it gains +1 to Attack.

The Forest Spider gains +1 attack any time it is engaged. When a player engages an enemy the enemy is still said to have engaged the player (this is straight from the rules). This +1 to attack is ONLY for the turn it engages though. After the turn in which it engages it goes back down to the regular 2 attack.

I completely agree regarding the Dunhere part of this, but...

I cannot see, how could a Son of Arnor attack an enemy in the staging area. According to the card text, Son of Arnor allow you to choose an enemy card in the staging area or currently engaged with another player and engage that enemy. Usually you play your allies in the Planning phase, so the enemy will get its attack later on in the Combat Phase. To avoid the attack of the enemy, you would need the Son of Arnor entering play after enemy attacks (e.g. with the use of Sneak Attack).

This +1 to attack is ONLY for the turn it engages though. After the turn in which it engages it goes back down to the regular 2 attack.



As I understand it means that when player engages Spider in Encounter Phase at the next phase (Combat phase) Spider'll have attack 3, and at any further round it's attack will be 2.

Then what if player using some card effect prevent this Spider to attack at Combat phase? Will Spider have 3 attack at the next round or 2?

@ShadowGhost

You are correct. Son of Arnor only allows you to engage an enemy and not attack them. Once engaged that enemy works as a normal engaged enemy.

@LEGA

It doesn't matter if it attacks or not. The +1 attack expires at the end of the round. There is no requirement that it must attack in order for this to resolve. Feint would be a good way to avoid the 3 attack power Forest Spider. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Also a point of clarification, I believe Aragons response would be played immediately after her commits to the quest and not at the end of the questing phase. This nice becuase he is still comitted to the quest but not exhausted while card are being revealed and thus subject to nasty treachery cards i.e. necromancer's reach, etc.

Excellent!

 

Thank you all.  It makes sense, but sometimes you just need someone else to explain it.

 

I'm really enjoying the FFG forums.  Everyone is really nice.  Thank you!
