## 1 [cmabr002 on February 5, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/201508-in-the-shadows/?do=findComment&comment=2034215)

Due to the new FAQ [https://images-cdn.fantasyflightgames.com/filer_public/64/ee/64ee44ca-825d-4c14-b77b-b0ad7581ee31/lotr_faq_18.pdf] (1.55), does In the Shadows [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/In-the-Shadows-TLoS] only affect enemies currently engaged with you, or would enemies you engage after you played the event also get the decreased stats?

 

Also, if the enemy somehow had its engagement cost decreased by an encounter card effect after you played the card (resulting in its engagement cost being equal to or lower than your threat) would the enemy still get the decreased stats?

I think only enemies engaged with you at the time of use. Are there many ways to engage enemies as a Combat Action?

Yes, Aragorn (Tactics)/Merry (Tactics)/Hour of Wrath.  I have an entire deck built around Tactics Aragorn and engaging 5-10 enemies and killing them all in one turn in multi-player games.  Sadly, it sort of relies on the -1 Defense of this card (not always, since the deck has other means of increasing damage).

 

The card used to affect all enemies that you were engaged with currently and any enemies you engaged later, but the new ruling seems to indicate to me that it only affects enemies currently engaged with you now.  Sad :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

Would you post your deck?

Is this backed up anywhere? Cause I always read that card as only affecting the enemies with which you are currently engaged.

They said previously that such effects (ones that last "until the end of the x" constantly update as the game state changes.  This has been changed in the most recent FAQ, though, which is why I've presented the question.

 

If an encounter card said "When Revealed: Each enemy engaged with a player gets +1 attack until the end of the round." I do not see why it would not affect enemies that engage you later based on the ruling that says these card effects update as the game state changes.  I do see the argument for it only being enemies currently engaged with a player, but based solely on the ruling that says the effects update as the game state changes, makes me fairly certain (whether it is intended or not) we should give the attack boost to enemies that engage you later in the round since that is a game state change and the card avoids using the word "currently".

Sure.  Note that the deck is not refined, by any means which is why I hadn't posted it.  Also, due to the FAQ change, I'd probably just remove both In the Shadows as they are pretty useless now.  The deck is basically about drawing as many cards as you can until you get Hour of Wrath and using Hour of Wrath to kill all the enemies.  Fast Hitch and Rohan Warhorse allow you to kill more than one enemy per turn as well so you're not entirely reliant on drawing Hour of Wrath. The reason this deck doesn't include some "auto-includes" like Daeron's Runes, is because I made this deck specifically to avoid conflicts with other decks I already have and do not wish to dismantle.  There is absolutely no reason this deck should not have 3x Daeron's Runes if you're only objective is to have it be as consistent as possible.  Probably one or two Master of the Forge would be worth it as well.

 

Dagger of Westernesse, Unseen Strike, Trollshaw Scout, and sometimes Blade of Gondolin give you the damage you need to kill just about any non-unique enemy.  Feel free to fiddle with the deck a bit, because I know it's not as efficient as it can be.

 

As I said in an earlier post, this deck is meant for multi-player, and is really weak on questing.  Due to this, cards like Quick Beam, Henamarth, and Mablung have been included to support questing, while Blade of Gondolin/Arod/Thror's Map assists with direct progress placement/location control.  This deck quite enjoys my teammate using Arwen hero as it allows the deck to play more cards that it's going to be drawing anyway (and otherwise would be unable to pay for) and can benefit from Tale of Tinuviel (although Glorfindel is better if you're just going to be using ToT since he will likely have Light of Valinor).  It also enjoys a strong sentinel defender so that I can safely engage one enemy, kill it, and start the engagement chain with Aragorn/Merry/Hour of Wrath (with Hour of Wrath targeting Merry).

 

Edit: Also, you can replace Pippin in this deck with Sam, and it still functions in a similar way.  I chose Pippin for two reasons.  Easier access to Fast Hitch and because Steward of Gondor being used in other decks.  It is pretty funny to see Sam get up to like 7 attack, though.

Did someone ask Caleb about this?

 

There FAQ-entry about Lasting Effects is nice but there are many encounter cards with lasting effects which use the word "currently" and those effects cannot be recalculated.

While player cards never uses currently ...

> Disagree. I think, with the new FAQ ruling, the word "currently" is now completely redundant on old encounter cards.... ignore it.

Hmm??? 

 

I think I misunderstand you.  The word "currently" on encounter cards means they do not recalculate.  The omission of the word currently on an encounter card means it will check for updates.

 

The ruling distinguished player cards from encounter cards so what is true for player cards is no longer (necessarily) true for encounter cards.  Basically, if player cards used the word currently, it would be redundant.  But "currently" on an encounter card still has meaning.

Each class is handled differently as follows: A lasting effect created by a player card ability must be calculated at the time that the ability is triggered, and that effect is not recalculated if the game state changes.

I guess your interpretation of the bold part means you ignore the word currently altogether because the effect after the word currently is still a lasting effect?  My interpretation is that the word "currently" overrides this FAQ ruling as it is explicit in what it is targeting and thus it would not recalculate if say an enemy was later added to the staging area and a treachery was previously revealed that increased the threat of each enemy "currently" in the staging area.

Yeah, I just deleted my original response because they left that bit about "currently" vs cards without "currently" in the FAQ (Treacherous Fog vs Driven by Shadow)
