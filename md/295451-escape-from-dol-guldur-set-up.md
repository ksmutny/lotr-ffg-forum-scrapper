Apologies if this has been answered before:

When I set up Escape from Dol Guldur and add encounter cards to the Objectives. Do Treachery cards that have 'when revealed' on them have no effect because I'm just 'attaching' the encounter cards rather than 'revealing' them? Or do they resolve normally and have an effect?

Many thanks for help

If I remember well, you resolve and then discard them as usual. Then you can pick the objective as soon as you can (or want), because it has no encounter card attached to it

If a treachery is releaved while using the Guarded keyword of an Objective the threacher resolve normally, then that Objective is free of encounters and so you could pick it straight away

The When Revealed effect is still resolved.

Now, if a card is added to the staging area instead of being revealed, when revealed effects don't trigger.
