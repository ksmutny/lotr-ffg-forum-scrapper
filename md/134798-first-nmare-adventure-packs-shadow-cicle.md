New Drudan Forest seems insanely brutal.

 

Also, too few Steward's Fear details!  :angry: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_angry.png]

Welcome to Nightmare! where all basic enemy is more powerfull than a Nazgul and each location is worth 3 basic location.

 

At least, we got our infinite loop at turn 1 deck back to fight it...

Wasn't that deck errata'd?

I wish how nmare Amon Din runs. Normal version was too easy.

I like a lot the new Dru-Buri-Dru artwork.

There's a new one with Follow Me!

Will post the strategy if you want (maybe with the permission of one who found it), but it's very long and more complicated than the previous one.

Is there a place I can check it out, or it is someone's personal?

Unfortunately, I can't.

I tried Google translate on the forum to decent effect. The basic idea behind the new infinite looks to involve recycling events with the tomes from Against the Shadow during planning and then ending the loop with a copy of Follow Me! so that the next player can do the same. Actual resource generation is happening thanks to the use of A Very Good Tale + replaying Durin's Song (which also provides as much questing as needed), and the tomes get recycled by Second Breakfast. They don't go through all the steps of the loop, but it sounds complex and like it may not work well in solo.

Follow Me! require to play multiplayer.

Well, this is not the topic to discuss it. Wait for it, it is very likely that it will be posted on BGG and / or here.

Hi, I'm considering ordering directly from the FF print on demand shop but I it's not clear what is the lead time between the order and the dispatch.

If they only have a few printers the dispatch time could get quite erratic I think, maybe weeks.

Can you share your experiences ordering print on demand from the FF shop?

It depends on where you live from what I can tell. I'm in the US and have had quick service. Some of the euros have reported very slow delivery.

I know the name is print on demand, but as they are printing them themselves, I'd imagine they don't actually print them purely on demand. I'd bet they have a small stockpile ready to go, and print to replace.

I hope the image for Nightmare Dru-Buri-Bru is an older version of the card which has since been corrected, because while normally only taking 1 damage per round would be a problem, on stage 3 of the Druadan Forest enemies take progress rather than damage so technically that text wouldn't do anything...

I ordered PoD twice from FFG online store. 

 

First time (mid-2014) the package was sent approx. 2 weeks after I placed and paid for my order,

the second time (Jan 2015) it was under a week.

 

So not that bad, I guess.

 

Mind you, this was the timing for FFG to ship out, not for the package to reach my doorstep. So you need to add time for the actual delivery to wherever you might be.
