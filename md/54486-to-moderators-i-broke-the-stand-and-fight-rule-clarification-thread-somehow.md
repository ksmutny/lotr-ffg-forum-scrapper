Bumping this thread because I want the forums to be able to work in the future.

Hm, looks perfectly alright to me. Maybe they already corrected it or maybe you need to update/reset your browser. I've had strange things happenig to me too when using the forum via iphone/ipad and it always helps to reset the browser for me.
