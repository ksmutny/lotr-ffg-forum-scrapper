That's 7 - 10 days for the USA!

1 to 2 weeks for the rest of us! Yay!

Also, nin-in-thingy is on the boat.

Sadly, the road darkens is still printing...

Woo-hoo, looks like Tharbad should definitely be Gen Con. I'm a bit worried about Road Darkens though. At this point last year, they had already said Black Riders would be at Gen Con for sure, but no such announcement this time around.

I'm expecting The Road Darkens around Christmas, but maybe they'll surprise me with something earlier.  

 

It would make sense, though, not just because of the holiday shopping season, but because at this rate we will see the last pack in the Ringmaker cycle in November or early December, making later December a logical time to put a new box into stores.

Well, I thought not to see Trouble in Tharbad earlier than GenCon anyways. I just hope both it and Road Darkness get released there, because it'll be moths before they reach me.

 

And if there actually going to be a new cycle spoil - super excitey!
