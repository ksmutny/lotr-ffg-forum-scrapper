hi guys, just a question about this card:

it says:

While River Anduin is in the staging area it gains: "Forced: At the end of the travel phase, each player at this stage raises his threat by 1. Then, River Anduin moves to the staging area to the left, if able."

what is the meaning of this phrase?

In a multiplayer game, the players get split up.  During the quest, each player will have his or her own staging area.  At the end of the travel phase, if River Anduin is still in the staging area, it will move to the the "next" player's staging area (remove it from the current player's staging area and put it into the staging area of the player to the left).

 

In a one player game, this text will have no effect.
