Is there anything official from FFG on negative threat?  Seen a lot of conversation on the forums but nothing concrete?   The rules don't seem to say anything about it so has anyone heard from FFG?

 I think there was something about clarifying it in the next FAQ.

But I think we can all agree it would makes no sense to have negative threat, as it would make no sense to have negative progress.

Ether there is a threat or there is no threat. But what would negative threat be.

We can´t count negative threat and scoring with negative threat seems storage too. There could be an infinite negative score this way.

There is no need for any kind of FAQ on this.  You should never assume that a nummber can be negative in a game unless the rules explictly state it.

You can't have negative will, just like a character can not have a negative attack, defense or willpower score.
