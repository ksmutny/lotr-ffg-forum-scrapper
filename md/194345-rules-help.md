i am new to this game and am a bit confused. on pqge 10 of the rule book it says use encounter cards passage through mirkwood, spiders of mirkwood and dol guldur orcs. i have 3 dol guldur orcs cards but no encounter cards called passage through mirkwood or spiders of mirkwood, Am i missing them or am i reading it wrong? thank you

Encounter cards are grouped into different sets. Here, "Passage througn Mirkwood", "Spiders of Mirkwood", and "Dol Guldur Orcs" refer to the names of the three sets you need for this quest. The set a given card belongs to is indicated by a little picture in a circle on the middle-right of the encounter card. See p.26 of the rulebook to see which pictures correspond to the three encounter card sets you need for this quest. Then, take all cards with these pictures and shuffle them together to form the encounter deck for this quest.

 

The fact that the set is called Dol Guldur Orcs and there is a card within the set called Dol Guldur Orcs is an unfortunate confusion.

When it's referring to how you construct the encounter deck, it's referring to the different encounter sets, which are distinguished by the encounter set symbols found on the right where the card art meets the text box (and the rulebook tells you which symbol corresponds to which encounter set). Your confusion here is because the encounter set 'Dol Guldur Orcs' also contains a specific individual card called 'Dol Guldur Orcs'. It's referring to the whole encounter set though, which is all of these cards: http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Search?EncounterSet=Dol%20Guldur%20Orcs [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Search?EncounterSet=Dol%20Guldur%20Orcs]. You'll note they all have the little symbol of an orc's face. Similarly the Passage Through Mirkwood set have the symbol of a little tree, and Spiders of Mirkwood a spider.

once you have finished successfully the intrdcuctory quest it talks about in the books, the quest that uses a passage through mirkwood, spiders of mirkwood and dol guldor orcs encounter sets and you want to progress and do a harder quest. how do you decide what quest cards to use ?

i take it they are not mix and match and you progress in a certain order

thank you for your patience

The quest cards themselves bear the icons for the encounter card sets they need.

this is a bit of an unusual request and i dont really expect any replies, i am disabled, in a wheelchair and have just moved to swadlincote in derbyshire so i dont have any mates to play this game with. i am straight and this is not a chat up line but if somebody wants a quick game that would be much appreciated

the quest cards tell you what encounter sets to use but how do you decide what quest cards to use once you have finished the introductory quest ?

There are two other quests in the core set, Journey Down The Anduin and Escape From Dol Guldor. The choice of which quest to follow Passage Through Mirkwood is entirely up to you.
