Not yet but we know from stuff that was written they are planned. Will be a unique scenario played by teams competing to see who gets the best score beating the scenario.

I hope the scenarios becomes available at some point after each tournament season.

I'm sure they will be made available.

So who else thinks that FFG will likely be getting use out of their Print on Demand shop for the tourney scenarios and that they'll then later be released in adventure packs or boxed expansions?

I hope league play allows you to register as a team against the scenario, with teams competing for lowest score. So you aren't competing with anyone at your table. It'd be an extremely unique play environment that way. The teams could be called "Fellowships" and consist of 2-4 players.  Special rewards for lowest average score, and best team work. Things like that. To me it'd foster a weekly home play group each week to tweak and practice before the league nights.
