in this quest (and this can be a general question as well) you either shuffle in a ringwraith or discard X progress from the quest each turn

 

my question is....if you have no progress to discard, can you still chose that option? i assume not?

thanks

If there isn't any progress on the quest card you'll just have to shuffle in a Ringwraith.  Same would go for the treachery Unwanted Attention -- remove 2 heroes you control from the quest or shuffle in a Ringwraith.  If you don't have 2 questing heroes, gotta shuffle a Ringwraith in.  In a game we played, we got a couple of copies of Black Breath that lowered our heroes' stats all to 0 -- makes them useless for questing, except as a little insurance against Unwanted Attention.

I also play the other way: if I have no out of play Ringwraith left, I must discard 2 progress from the quest.

Though I'm probably close to loosing in this case :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
