Ranger Spikes
Type: Attachment Sphere: Lore
Cost: 2
Trap.
Play Ranger Spikes into the staging area unattached.
If unattached, attach Ranger Spikes to the next eligible enemy that enters the staging area.
Players do not make engagement checks against attached enemy. Attached enemy gets -2 [Threat].

 

Are they possible to unattach, other than by killing the enemy? 

 

What happens when they are unattached, e.g. after attached enemy dies? They remain and attach to the next enemy that enters? If 2 are unattached at the same time, do they stack on the same enemy? There are some commenters on Cardgamedb.com who believe that they go into the discard pile - but wouldn't killing the enemy unattach the spikes, hence triggering the second line of text?

 

Can players still optionally engage attached enemies?

 

Thanks!

hi

they cannot be taken off the enemy, and are put into the players discard pile who played it (the reason we know this is anborn allows you to recycle traps)

i believe they do stack on the same enemy if you have 2 in the staging when it appears

 

you can still optionally engage
