# [First Age (Custom Quest)](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/108579-first-age-custom-quest/)

## 1 [Raven1015 on June 13, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/108579-first-age-custom-quest/?do=findComment&comment=1119224)

After a process that seemed never-ending at times, the First Age custom expansion is complete! First Age takes players back to the First Age of Middle-Earth, including 15 new heroes, almost 100 player cards, and 3 new quests focusing on Beren and Luthien's quest for a Silmaril. I hope you enjoy!

Congratulations, very nice work. Really good.

Nice job!  What are the quests like?  How hard are they?

 

Some comments:

I love the dwarf characters.

The hidden house card, that is supposed to be Mim the Dwarf's house?

The Huan card is the weirdest art ever......really odd  :huh: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_huh.png]

The Poisoned Javelin is pretty cool

I love the Haladin Woodsman because I love running mono spirit decks.  However there are few options for combat other than spirit Glorfindel and tactic songs.  Spirit needs more characters like that.

 

by the way, I noticed the Chieftain Of Men art is the cover art from the PC game Mount and Blade: Warband.  That is a very fun game. 

 

I'm sure finding pictures for all those cards was one of the hardest parts!!!

 

Great job,

Khamul

The quests are definitely on the more difficult side, but they are eventually beatable with the right strategy. During playtesting, playtesters reported about 7-8 attempts before getting their first victory against the first quest, as an example. I wanted to avoid players beating them quickly and forgetting them, Because of the nature of the story and the quests, they do tend to be fairly heavy on combat and beating big boss-type enemies. 

 

The hidden house is indeed Mim's secret hiding spot. The art was definitely the hardest part of the project; lots of hours spent searching for good art!

Looks awesome, but what is to stop you from putting 3x solitary outlaw in your deck and get all three on a hero during setup?

## 7 [Raven1015 on June 13, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/108579-first-age-custom-quest/?do=findComment&comment=1119835)

Unfortunately, the "Limit 1 per hero" was accidentally omitted from Solitary Outlaw. 

 

p.s. The other known errata at this time is that Huan should have "(Limit once per round.)" at the end of his first ability, but the intent should be clear. 

 

I apologize for the couple of errors that crept in! Let me know if you have any other questions.

Fantastic job!  I love the idea and have been waiting to see how someone might tackle it.  You've got some interesting mechanic ideas going on.  My only criticism is that many of the cards are very wordy.  This makes the learning curve steep and often makes gameplay overcomplicated.  I've had the same criticism of some of the more recent official LotR products also.

## 10 [Distractionbeast on June 14, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/108579-first-age-custom-quest/?do=findComment&comment=1120262)

BTW, I have a friendly suggestion about the Mastery sphere.  I would recommend making it an acquired sphere instead of a native one.  Meaning that no heroes would have that sphere printed, but could acquire it though attachments, abilities or other means.  This way, it may be possible to truly represent a theme of mastery by requiring particular prerequisites of the heroes before they could begin spending Mastery resources.

 

Example:

 

Tactics Attachment:

 

Hardened Warrior  Cost: 1

 

Title.

 

Attach to a (tactics) hero.  

Response: After attached hero attacks alone and destroys an enemy, attached hero gains a (mastery) resource icon.

## 11 [booored on June 14, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/108579-first-age-custom-quest/?do=findComment&comment=1120263)

yeah, brevity is a problem in card games. You need to make the cards short enough to be easily digestible but clear enough to make sense. This is why keywords play such a important role. A single keyword can conveys a series of instructions. Like Surge == Reveal a new card form the encounter deck" You see this in most armature card designs like Trollo's for example and if you spend any time playing the 100s of customs sets... wordy cards is a mega problem. I know my own custom cads also can have this kind of problem.

 

All in all I have gone though this set and think it is a worthy addition to the custom scene. I like the quests, and especially like how they have gone for a setting that is separated from the real game. Its size is unusually I think it is the 2nd digest set released. My guess is that they will expand this set with expansions and the game will basically become a new version, unrelated to FFG's game. It doesn't make much sense to play Bilbo and characters form this age!

 

All in all a great effort.. hope you sent emails to all the artists you stole from hehe

A dream comes true, i will play fingolfin hero!!!

The pert of the story you chose is a great one indeed, i really hopw and wish you can make some other in the future, either from first age, or maybe something with Numenor and second age.

Thanks for all the kind words! To give you an idea, any errata will be fixed in both the octgn set and the printable materials, but Im waiting about a week to make sure I catch everything rather than having to make fixes one by one.

As I read, tere will be a possibility for players to ordr the cards from somewhere, any idea on when this might be possible?

## 16 [booored on June 14, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/108579-first-age-custom-quest/?do=findComment&comment=1120648)

> any errata will be fixed in (snip) about a week

well at least a week I guess, as the errata is not going to happen til then so said Raven.

There are 2 online custom card stores I know that are pretty popular. Printer Studio and ArtsCOW. My guess is that it will be either one or both of these. PS is the superior store, much higher quality cards, but ArtsCOW is able to have custom sets that people can just click on and print. So it is much easier.

Here is a comparison

ArtsCOW vs Printer Studio Head to Head Results [http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/832754/artscow-vs-printerstudio-head-to-head-results] @BGG

In my experience.. the PrinterStudio 310 Linen cards are better quality than most professional cards, including the LCG ones. They are that good.

Even though PrinterStudio dose not have the link sharing that ArtsCoW dose... there is a sort of "hack" that allows it...

> As I read, tere will be a possibility for players to ordr the cards from somewhere, any idea on when this might be possible?

 

If you head over to the First Age page [http://talesfromthecards.wordpress.com/first-age/], there are links to buying the sets on artscow. Currently, the designs do include the two known changes. It is a bit expensive on artscow, so if you go that route, make sure you use the discount code I posted there!

 

I'm working on getting First Age to be available on printerstudio, as I've heard many people say they prefer it to artscow, and that should be available fairly soon.

Just saw that the "evil lust" treachury card from seat of Morgoth has the art from Blind Guardian's "Nightfall in Middle Earth" concept album about Silmarillion .My signature come out of this , it's from the "time stand still at the iron hill" song, which is a song for Fingolfin. The album is one of my favorites in general !

FYI, the coupon code SHIP30 was a bigger discount for me than the one you listed, it made shipping free.

Good point. I think it depends on location, as the one I listed was cheaper than SHIP30 for me, but given how expensive shipping is on printerstudio, that one will definitely work better for some people. I'll add it to the page.

## 32 [scourn99 on July 29, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/108579-first-age-custom-quest/?do=findComment&comment=1174382)

I got my whole set from Artscow. Total was 79 bucks shipped. For 3 of everything and how good the card quality was, it was a steal. I hear printerstuido is even cheaper but I haven't checked it out yet. The cards feel and look super close to FFGs. I haven't gotten to play against any of the missions yet, but I plan to soon.

 

The only minor flaw was that they cut off around the boarders a bit, nothing that makes anything unplayable, but it can be seen on some.

 

I did sent printerstuido a set of 24 custom heroes I have worked on. Really doing it to see how well they turn out. Only came to 13 shipped. I could have filled out the other slots as I paid for 54 cards but used just 24. Said they wont come in around 9 days though. Will update as I get them

 

Being inspired by the first age, I have started some second age stuff. I know 1 of the missions is the siege of baradur and the last alliance , trying to pick the other two to really capture key points in the second age.

## 33 [NotAZombie on July 29, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/108579-first-age-custom-quest/?do=findComment&comment=1174957)

I just got my cards from Printer Studio, and they are excellent quality. They are slightly larger than FFG's (.5 mm height and length). $40 shipped, super good price. The quality was also roughly on par with FFG's.

> Anyone play this quests already? Normaly I don t play custom fans quest but this one looks so good + is a first age....

 

Today made my first attempt through OCTGN

 

Glaurung these quests where made for you ... Nightmare packs are like kindergarden compared to First Age quests. I got crashed on two of them (did not tried the first one since the deck I made on OCTGN had Finrod in it), but loved all  of them. Very nice encounter cards, very nice scenarios, very very difficult (more than 10 difficulty IMO). I tried a deck based on Finrod, Finglofin and Beren, while I was questing good, and Fingolfin with his shield was a great defender, I did not manage to have good attack power, mainly cause the quests where giving me a very hard time and did not have the resources to deploy the cards the way I wanted. Managed to place 15 damage points on Carcaroth though hehehehehe

 

I will defenitily buy the cards to play it, cause in OCTGN making decks is something that I do not like. 

 

 

Very nice work indeed, well done and plz make more quests and more cards too (especially Noldor warrior allies)

 

 

PS: Can you plz explain me how the pit thing works, I read the quest stages but did not quite get it

## 36 [Raven1015 on August 30, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/108579-first-age-custom-quest/?do=findComment&comment=1238043)

Thanks for trying out First Age and I'm glad you like it! The quests are definitely quite difficult, but are eventually beatable once you get the hang of everything (to give you an idea, I designed the things, and I still lose pretty often!). 

 

There will definitely be some more quests and player cards on the way. I'm designing the first "expansion" right now, and I hope to have it out around Octoberish. 

 

As for the pit area, the gist is that the players can choose one hero to be placed there at the start of a game. Whoever gives up that hero may immediately replace that hero and adjust their starting threat accordingly. That area is off limit for player cards, similar to the riddle area in the Dungeons Deep quest. When the counters run out on Eyes in the Dark, the Devouring Werewolf is placed into the pit area and engages in combat with the hero in the pit and Finrod objective. If the hero placed there is destroyed, then you lose. 

 

If you haven't checked out, give a look at the First Age rules [http://talesfromthecards.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/first-age-rules.pdf], which explains some of the stuff in more detail. Hope this helps!

Thanks Raven. I have read the rules already. You explanation make things more clear, i think my problem might be that since i am not that familiar with octgn, making pit areas etc seems a bit strange. When i get the cards i am sure i will understand how it works.

Have tried the seat of morgoth quest yesterday again. I got much further (tweaked my deck a lot) but still lost. I like them very much. Yet again the fact i do not have them on hand and try to make deck only with octgn does not help me.

Really great work. First age is my favourite and recently read sillmarillion for the third time :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png], now rereading unfinished tales. Well done :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I've got a plea regarding OCTGN. Could you tag those old approved cards in searchtool in deckbuilder as First Age? It is hard to make a deck when many cards are listed only by name, especially that I'm foreign and I usually use different card names.

Will we ever see nightmare version of these scenarios? They used to seem hard, but once you know the cards they're extremely easy. Last time I fought Morgoth instead of winning I decided to kill every single enemy worth victory points and capture most treacheries under Caranthir. Encounter deck didn't even try to fight back. Scenarios are still fun, but it would be nice too feel Morgoth's might once more

It's an interesting thought, thanks! Right now, I'm neck deep in designing the Doom Mastered cycle, and should have the 2nd quest out in the next couple of weeks. That alone, in addition to other LOTR LCG stuff, takes up most of the limited free time I have. That being said, I'm definitely not against the idea and would love to do it if I can ever free up some time. So I guess my short answer is "Not anytime soon", but "Potentially in the future"! Sooner if I can recruit a fellow First Age designer or two, which may be a good idea anyway to get these things out faster.

## 48 [koriakin97 on September 16, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/108579-first-age-custom-quest/?do=findComment&comment=1799662)

I checked some cards in Polish translation and there is one mistake- Thingol in his rule has House of Finarfin (Ród Finarfina) instead of House of Feanor (Ród Feanora)

 

Edit: I found another two. Idril returns ally of up to X cost (o koszcie co najwyżej X) instead of ally of X cost (o koszcie co najwyżej X). And Caranthir has in his action -1 attack instead of +1 attack. I hope it doesn't sound like I don't like it, it's the best player-made expansion I ever played

Thank you Koriakin for bumping this thread as I would have never seen it!    I skimmed through the cards, mostly looking at the heroes, and am blown away be the effort and detail that went into this.  Very awesome job Raven!  I must say it is driving me nuts trying to remember where I know the art for Curufin for.   I keep almost picturing it but just can't quite remember it well enough to identify.  I'm nearly certain it comes from a movie... Egypt for certain...  HA!   Stargate!   fantastic.

 

I'm curious what program you used to create your output file with the crop marks though.   Does your source art include any excess bleed?

Thanks koriakin, I'm glad you enjoy the First Age expansion! I will contact the Polish translator and see about fixing those errors.

 

Slothgodfather, thanks for your kind words as well! I use Strange Eons to make pretty much everything, including the cards themselves and the PDF printables. There's an option in the program to create bleed margins as well.

After a year of searching a place to print the cards (i cannot get artscow in greece, very expensive and we are under bank restrictions) finally last week i got the core set player and encounter cards ...

Today since i am down with a virus, i had my first plays on isle of werewolfs ... After 5 attempts managed to beat the quest just in time -prisoner Finrod was already gone, my hero was 1 damage away from being destroyed. I tried to be a bit thematic. Thus i had Beren, Luthien and then my most loved one, the valiant high king of Noldor, Fingolfin who faught bravely against the werewolfs and Sauron, till Thorondor, Huan, Azaghal and others made him flee.

Can't express how happy i am to have these cards, i am a fan of sillmarillion and all these heroes are my favourites.

Thanks again raven

PS: Just a question. There is no way i can attack the devouring werewolf right? He is in the pit thus i cannot declare attackers against him isn't it? Also, does he contribute his threat in the questing phase?
