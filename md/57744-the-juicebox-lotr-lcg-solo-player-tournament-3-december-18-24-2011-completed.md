Welcome & Introduction:

Welcome to my third Solo Player LOTR LCG Tournament. This week’s tournament marks the beginning of a series of tournaments that will focus on the Shadows of Mirkwood cycle. The idea behind this tournament is that for one week (Sunday – Saturday), everyone is invited to participate in playing a particular quest with particular deck building requirements in a Solo Player Tournament. You are then invited to record and post your final score, the heroes you used, and any additional narrative that you’d like to add.

Note: this is not a place to post results from the past. The tournament has a one-week lifespan, and only games played and recorded throughout this week are valid. As the week unfolds, I will keep this first post updated with the Top Ten results. (Each participant can occupy a maximum of one Top Ten spot at a time, so you’re welcome to try and best your own result throughout the week.) See also, The juicebox LOTR LCG Top Ten Hall of Fame [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=582954].

Will you place in the Top Ten for the week? I hope you’ll participate and find out!

After the end of this week’s tournament, you are welcome to continue to post results to this thread if you continue to play this particular quest under these particular parameters. However, the Top Ten on this first post will not continue to be updated after the week is over, thus preserving (like a time capsule) the results from this week’s tournament. Further, please refrain from using this thread for extensive theorizing and/or conversation that is not directly related to this particular tournament. Nothing against other conversations – it’s just, that’s what other threads are for. Specifically, if you have ideas for a future tournament of the week, feel free to suggest them in the Ideas Thread [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=579104&efpag=0].

And now… on to this week’s Solo Player Tournament!

I don't expect this to hold, but just to get the ball rolling... gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]

Éowyn, Beravor, Glorfindel

Threat: 43

Hero Wounds: 3

Victory Points: 3

Round Tracker: 70

Total: 113

I forgot about the forced rule on 1B twice. In my third attempt I got a 101:

 

Heroes: Théodred, Bilbo, Éowyn

Threat: 24

Hero Wounds: 3

Victory Points: 6

Round Tracker: 80

Total: 101

 

Looks like the round tracker is not always the deciding factor. I'm just wondering what Juicy did to get his threat to 43?!?

Since Quest Card 2B requires revealing 2 cards off the encounter deck and adding 1 to the staging area at the beginning of the quest phase, when presented with the option of adding Hunters from Mordor (I had 2 Clue cards in play) or Pursued by Shadows, I chose PbS. It's a devastating card at that point because it's the beginning of the quest phase and no one has committed yet to the quest. But at the time, it felt like the less brutal of my options.

I believe I also had another Pursued by Shadows come off the encounter deck naturally at a time when I had left a few characters standing ready for battle.

Further, I'm pretty sure I encountered some Flooding along the way.

These Treachery cards really can be treacherous!

In any case, it made for a pretty thrilling (read as "threat was skyrocketing") ride.

Thanks for your curiosity. Éowyn, Beravor, and Glorfindel sure appreciate your care and concern about their wellbeing. gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]

PS: As a cool "thematic" moment, I can actually remember getting so annoyed by PbS, and thinking, "Geez, why is this card so brutal?" Then I studied it further and realized that in that moment there was actually a Nazgul searching the skies for me, and I had an actual feeling of relief wash over me as I thought, "Okay, this makes perfect sense now. I guess I'm actually just quite lucky to be out of his reach!" I could even hear (in my mind) the croaking screams of the Nazgul (from the movie) braying in the skies above. It was a pretty fun moment, and one more reason I continue to enjoy this game so much.

Cool, I had such a "ride" myself - 3 Hunters, 2 cluecards - but my fellowship made it.

 

Ok, back to the results that count:

 

Heroes: Théodred, Bilbo, Èowyn

Threat: 16

Hero Wounds: 0

Victory Points: 3

Round Tracker: 80

Total: 93

 

My deck had it all - Steward of Gonor, 2x Sneak Attack /Gandalf, Northern Tracker and Daughter of the Nimrodel played in round 2, Faramir in round 4, 2 x Galadrim's Greeting. Unfortunatly I had to fight 3 Hunters (1 Gollum card out there all the time) and had to use Gandalf's ability to kill the first one - otherwise I could have finished the game 2 rounds earlier.

Took a while today, but the second deck finally worked!  Heros, eowyn, dunhere, Eleanor.  Not a pure mono sphere deck as I used song of kings for around a dozen leadership cards in addition to 3x gandalf of course.  Ended up with a final threat of 21, 3 victory points, 9 rounds, for a total of 108.

Incredible, a 73 would seem impossible!!!  You must have been blowing through on your questing phase!  Wow!

Well, another high threat adventure for me, but with a slightly sweeter result...

Heroes: Éowyn, Bilbo, Aragorn

Final Threat: 44

Hero Wounds: 4

Victory Points: 3

Round Tracker: 60

Total Score: 105

At the very beginning of this game I had the crazy experience of immediate delight when I pulled off a Clue card during game setup and then immediate frustration when Old Wives Tales showed up to guard the Clue. Because it was during game set up, none of my heroes had resources yet, so I had to exhaust them all and had no one to quest with during round one. Ah, just the beginning of the threat climbing (thematically delightful though, when you think about it). Oh, and later on in Quest Card 2B, I lost my Clue card because of Evil Storm. I had one Spirit resource and A Test of Will in my hand, but The West Bank was my active location, making Event Cards cost an extra resource. Rage and Agony! I like this deck though, and I plan to try it out some more later in the week.

 Heroes: Eowyn, Aragon, Theodred

 

Threat: 27

Wounds: 1

Rounds : 3

 

Final Score 58

 

Got an unbelievable score. It was actually my first attempt. I got an ealy Clue with Evil Storm attached. One of the best treacheries early in the game.

First Round Sneak Gandalf helped too.

One False Lead was Will of the Wested.......

 

Again I believe it´s soooo luck dependent. If you can´t get a quick clue there is no way to get a good score.

My second and third attempt were´t so good. One game I lost a hero and in the other one it took me 7 rounds to get a clue.......finishing with 112.

 I meant  A Test of Will and not Will of the West.........of course.

A quick clue an also prevent a good score if you have some Hunters in the staging area. But yep, you need some good encounters to make a fantastic result - in my last game I got through 1B in two turns, had almost finished 2B in my third turn and was on my way to get a ~60pts result. But then I got  Goblin Raider combined with Gamdalf and a Hunter. And just when i made enough progress to make it to 3B I got False Lead and had nothing to deflect it. In the end it took me 15 turns to end the game (lost another clue), but it still was awesome.

Done here with a Spirit/Leader deck. Unluckly I cannot low my theath, nor with Gandalf, nor with Greetings. Up to this, in 7 turns I have done it, not my best (it is 96), but yet still a solid score

Final Threath: 37

No heroes dead, no wounds

6 Victory Points (2x Gladden Fields)

7 Turns to Complete

TOTAL: 101 pts

 

Here you have my deck. It is used 1x Core + 1 x Hunt for Gollum. I really wish to have at least 3 Unexpect Courage and one more Northern Tracker, but I cannot afford it (FFG is always having so many good games... last bought is Gears of War !!!!)

2 Northern Tracker
2 The Favor of the Lady
1 Unexpected Courage
2 Hasty Stroke
2 Stand and Fight
2 The Galadhrim's Greeting
2 A Test of Will

My hero choice exactly!

 

I just finished with a score of 72.

Win on turn 6 (50)

Threat of 25

3 VP (Gladden Fields)

0 damage.

 

I certainly agree that luck plays an important role as I got a Steward of Gondor and 2 Northern Trackers in my starting hand. With Theodred you can play the 2nd Tracker on the beginning of turn 3 already. Some unlucky moments also: My first clue card immediately went away, it was "guarded" by a False Lead, small bummer there. Son of Arnor + Forest Snare took care of one hunter and Henamarth was huge as always.

 

P.S.: In order to improve everybodies understanding of the rules and to minimize the mistakes people make (me included), I would like to somehow log my games via Lackey CCG. Does anybody know, if such a feature exists? Or a different, but convenient, method of logging games?

It is not that incredible. With two early Northern Trackers and many locations coming off the Encounter deck it was almost an auto play. The whole game I only saw one Hunters from Mordor (and one Eastern Crwos on the last but meaningless turn), that got snared. So between perfect information from Henamarth Riversong and not having to attack or defend once, I could push through the quest pretty easily.

The timing of your questing is a deicisve factor in this scenario, especially in 1B. if you make progres,, make lot of progress to avoid extra cards in the staging area. Try to limit combats to a minimum, as the shadow effects (Hunter) can ruin a good result. That means of course good threat management. Don't let your threat get at 30 or higher. Northern Tracker is a must, especially when you combine him with some Snowborn Scouts.

 In my win I had 2 northern trackers, a Lorien guide, and faramir.  But I didn't get them in as early as you guys did.  Once in though, they and the others definitely sped things up!!!

 Two wins today, but the first was only a 130.  The second though I almost broke 100!  Got a 103---final threat 25; 1 damage; 3victory points; 7 rounds.  Heroes:  theodred; Eleanor; eowyn.  Slightly different deck than yesterday.

Pretty sweet run tonight...

Some pretty lovely draws off the encounter deck and some sneak questing with Gandalf made for my best score yet!

 Wow - had some really bad luck with this run!

Three hunters in the first couple of turns and a Goblintown Scavengers that hit a Gandalf :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

I've got much lower in the past so hopefully I'll have time for another run and a lower score...

I reaction to the ongoing discussion about Éowyn I bult a deck without her. First try was a solid 113, second try was better:

 

Heroes: Glorfindel, Bilbo, Legolas

Final Threat: 32

Hero Damage: 1

Victory Points: 6

Round Tracker: 60

Result: 87

 

I added 3x Song of Kings and the "best of" Leadership: Faramir, Celebrion's Stone, Sneak Attack and Steward of Gondor. I was only to able Sneak Attack om this game, but was lucky with the encounters (some enemies for Legolas, many treacheries, no Hunters!!!). I was very close to make it even one round earlier, but missed it by 2 WP.

 The only game I could squeeze in this week, and fortunately a good one.

 

Flying the flag for the four-sphere deck, although no Song of Kings showed up on time.

 

Heroes: Eowyn, Beravor, Legolas

Result: won on the 6th round (50 points)

Threat: 33

Wounds: 1

VPs: 3 (Gladden Fields)

Total score: 81

A few enemies for Legolas to kill (Misty Mountain Goblins, Scavengers) and a few locations and treacheries but none of the really nasty ones. I took a chance by picking an Eastern Crows as my additional encounter card on stage 2 and was rewarded when it surged into the first Clue, guarded by some Goblins. With the Goblins dispatched that turn and the Clue claimed on turn 4, I could race through stages 2 and 3 in 3 turns total for a good overall score.  

 EDIT: The deck uses a few HfG cards, of which the Westfold Horse-breaker was used to good effect, readying Beravor to let her help out Legolas in killing an enemy. Song of Kings, Winged Guardian and Rivendell Minstrel didn't feature this time.

Okay had a much better run this time :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] I dropped the lore stuff as I think it slows the deck down early game - which is bad with the 2 encounters per turn in HFG.

 

Heroes: Éowyn, Theodred, Aragorn

Final Threat: 35

Hero Wounds: 2

Victory Points: 0

Round Tracker: 50

Final Score: 87

 

A much better run this time I had all three stewards of gondor in my hand by turn 2 but luckily Eowyn found the +1will they could provide useful too. I even managed to use a grim resolve to take out a Mordor hunter this game too :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

If you win in the sixth round, then isn't it 60 points?  It's 10 points per round including the first round and it includes each roun whether you finish mid round or not doesn't it?  If  I am wrong please let me know, because it means my score is 10 points less.

 I just found it, you tally the round points up at the end of the refresh phase, so you are correct.  Juicebox, this means my score last night was actually an 83. I apologize, my mistake.

Hi,

Here is my score for this quest : 71

 

Heroes : Aragorn, Theodred, Eowyn

I use 3 core set (no adventure pack)

 

Round Markers : 5 (50)

Final threat : 24

Wounds : 0

Victory Points : 3 (Gladden Fields)

Total : 71

## 31 [Scoob4 on December 21, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57744-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-solo-player-tournament-3-december-18-24-2011-completed/?do=findComment&comment=569970)

Greetings!

I used 3 core sets, and the HfG adventure pack to put together my deck.

My heroes were Bilbo, Eowyn, and Theodred. (A popular grouping, but I used Beravor instead of Bilbo for the first solo tournament and immediately thought of rotating in Bilbo for this one. Please forgive my apparent lack of originality.)

Now for my score:

Threat: 22

+ Hero Wounds : 4

+ Round Tracker: 80

- Victory Points: 6

Total: 100

I got a good early draw, getting both a Steward of Gondor (went to Eowyn because of the good spirit draw) and one Northern Tracker. First round draw saw another Northern Tracker. I actually chose to play a second Gladden Fields for the forced effect on stage 2B because of having two of those bad boys out. I succeeded on this quest without seeing a single Sneak Attack OR Gandalf. I was pretty pleased.

On other thing: I won the game by exploring Banks of the Anduin with the Northern Trackers' abilities, and then staging only that card, knowing that I had to get exactly 9 willpower (nothing else in staging area). I had Faramir and enough allies that even if I interpreted this incorrectly I would have won (next card down was Hunters for Mordor, for only 4 total threat instead of 1) but I wanted to make sure I got it right: Since the Tracker is a response action in the first (green) step of Phase 3, I think it's correct to explore the Banks before the second (red) step of Phase 3. Yes?

That's correct. The Banks get explored in the moment that you commit NT to the quest, which is before you deal a card from the encounter deck. So Banjs get placed at the top of the encounter deck before you draw your encounter.

 

 

Ok, so I abandoned my lore/tactics deck which wasn't made for good results. I built a leadership/lore deck afterwards which did not idisappoint me, but needs good early draws to get a good result. I played it 8 times, lost 3 games and had 141, 111, 105, 81 and 74 as results.

 

Heroes: Théodred, Glóin, Beravor

Hero Threat: 24

Hero Damage: None

Round Tracker: 50

Victory Points: None

Result: 74

 

I had quite good card draws, but got dealt a Hunter as guard for the objective card. Had to use Gandalf's ability plus a Dunedain pimped Glóin who was fighting for Gondor to get rid of the beast. Théodred and Glóin plus Steward of Gondor on Beravor assured  a nice flow of resources which was much needed as I drew all three Old Wive's Tales as encounters. Had eastern Crows at first round which kept attacking Glóin each round (had Self Preservation on him to keep his damage clean).

Will try the same deck with Bilbo instead of Beravor.

My first take on this tournament was with a spirit/lore deck.

Heroes: Bilbo, Eowyn, Glorfindel

Hero Threat: 13

Hero Damage: None

Round Tracker: 80

Victory Points: 3

Result: 90

I got a clue as the setup card, but it was guarded by an Old Wive's Tales which can be really nasty as setup, but luckily I got a location in the quest phase and had a Secret Paths in hand.

Gandalf came by to say hello three times, and the Galadhrim sent their greetings twice, hence my low threat.

I also had do restart phase 2b once because of a badly timed False Lead card, otherwise my score wouold have been better. I might try again tomorrow with the same deck and see if I can improve.

Heroes: Aragorn, Theodred, Bilbo Baggins

Hero Threat: 30

Hero Damage: 2

Round Tracker: 50

Victory Points: 3

Result: 79

First attempt at "The Hunt for Gollum", which I think resulted in a pretty decent score.

Bilbo was the nuts as his additional card draw was what kept my hand loaded with events that reduced threat levels during the quest phase.

 Maybe this is just barely low enough to crack the 10th spot...???  unless someone else has already done it  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

Heroes: Eowyn, Aragorn, Dunhere

This was my second attempt with this deck.  First attempt scored 107.

have to go and try again.

cracked it! (hopefully)

Eowyn, Aragorn, Theodred

Steward of Gondor on Aragorn 1st turn, Celebrian's a few later.

sneaked Gandalf twice, then played him properly. Also had the Theodred resource topping up, so loads of money all round.

Did first two stages quite quickly- got a clue just in the nick of time before being unable to progress to stage 3.

2x Galadrim's greeting, then a dwarven tomb for a third!

Final threat 6!!!

5 Rounds

score 56.

 Hey Mighty Jim, I thwarted you once...but now you have thwarted me.  I just scored a 57 and thought it would be the new top score...but no!  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

Heroes: Eowyn, Bilbo Baggins, Gloin

Threat: 15 

Damage: 2

Round: 40

V.P.:  0

TOTAL: 57

 

Sneak attack twice for Gandalf (reduced threat once, killed goblins the other time), and once regularly.  Galadhrim's Greeting twice.  Had Protector of Lorien in my opening hand.  Think I quested everybody every single time, except Gloin twice (once to get some damage and resources).  Always snuck Gandalf in the Questing phase to use his willpower to get a total of 11 willpower (!) without needing to discard anything.  

Drew a False Lead in the final questing phase, but I had A Test of Will from my opening hand which I had hung on to.  Booyah.

Extremely lucky.  No nasty encounter cards and got a Clue at the last possible moment....which leads me to some ideas about how we could improve these tourneys.  So, onto the ideas thread...

This is tough to do fast.  Stuff starts piling up in the middle.

 

Aragorn, Theodrin, Eowyn

 

Final Threat: 32

Rounds 4

Final Score 72.

 

Not sure I'm done with this... figure if I can get a couple more games in I can get a better game.  Really need to get lucky on the encounter card draw.  Need a lot of worthless treachery and an earlyish clue card to come up.  If you plan well you can blast through the 1B section in 1 round.  The trick to to get 2B done quickly but stuff can really pile up in the staging area.

Never got Steward of Gondor in that game with my score of 57.  I also never had a Northern Tracker down, which means there are more ways to beat this quest than I had supposed.  It was my first time trying with heroes from 3 different spheres.

## 42 [muemakan on December 23, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57744-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-solo-player-tournament-3-december-18-24-2011-completed/?do=findComment&comment=570818)

 Wow, that was quick.

Played three games:

First one ended with 86, Second one was ended after Hunters killed Aragorn in my third turn.

Third one was the best game EVER

Had a Steward in my starting hand.

Played SoG and Guard of the Citadel in my First Turn.

Gamewinner was a second turn Faramir.

Staging Encounter was Treacherous Fog.

Had 3 clues in play and  the last clue ( third round encounter) was guarded by Hunters. But due to Faramir and everybody questing I managed 15 willpower and discard one card for eowyn and finished in round 3 with just the right amount of progress. 

 2 evil storms in the course of the game made my life much easier. Old wives tale came when my heroes could afford it.

Didn´t had a Gandalf or GG.......but perfect encounters.

Again it shows how luck dependent it is..........Especially for this tournament the treacheries which apply only if your over 34 threat are superb.

 

Turn Counter 2.

Threat 31

Wounds none ( I didn´t fight once)

Total: 51

 

 

Vase: hod did you pay the 7 resources for the 2 GG and the Test of Will??

 muemakan:

 

I'm glad you said something about enough resources for those cards because I definitely said it wrong.  I remember now that I didn't play G's Greeting twice.  I had looked in my discard pile after I was done so that I could say something about it on here, and I saw two copies of the card.  But after thinking about it and realizing that I wouldn't have had enough resources to play that card twice, I remembered that one of the GG was a card I discarded to get more willpower (the other one I discarded was Unexpected Courage...never thought I would discard that if there wasn't already one in play!).

So I had GG once, and used Gandalf's threat reducing ability twice, for a total of -16 to my threat.  

My starting threat was 27.  

+4 to my threat for number of rounds played.  

27 + 4 - 16 = 15.

When I started my last round, I had 4 resources on Eowyn.  I played GG because I knew I was going to win, and saved one just incase I needed to use that Test of Will card.  I think the one other resource that Eowyn would have accumulated was used to pay for Gandalf the time I paid 5 for him.

 

Your score is insane.  What heroes did you use?

Tried A LOT of games without Éowyn, but could only get to another 74 round. That's why the Rohan Princess had a comeback from retirement:

 

Heroes: Éowyn, Théodred, Bilbo

Heroes Threat: 16

Hero Damage: 0

Round Marker: 40

Victory Points: 3

Result: 53 (or 56, see below)

 

Got Celebrián's Stone, Gandalf and GG in my starting hand. Protector of Lórien came in round 2. In my 2X th attempt for this tournament i finally got Treacherous Fog in the setup phase (instead of HoM). Got one clue in the first round, one in the second. I sent everyone questing each round. Got Pursued by Shadow twice - and here is a question: the second one I got as the forced effect of 1B. I didn't raise my threat by 3, but I am not sure if this was correct. Does the forced effect still belong to the questing phase? If not, my result would be 56.

Later I got another Gandalf, so I could decrease my threat level by 16 points. Gladden Fields and Flooding increased it by 2.

 

It took me 2 rounds to make it through stage 1B, 2 rounds through 2B and one round for 3B.

 

Encounter cards dealt:

 

Setup: Treacherous Fog

 

1st round: Sign, Pursued by Shadows. Forced: Pursued by Shadows.

WP vs Threat: +6

 

2nd round: Sign, West Bank; Forced Old Wifes' Tales

WP vs Threat +3

travel to WB

 

3rd round: Gladden Fields, Eastern Crows, Banks of Anduin

WP vs Threat: +2

travel to Gladden Fields (I had played a Snowborn Scout in round 2,so i could exploere WB)

 

4th round: Flooding, Ninglor, Eaves of Mirkwood

WP vs Threat: +13 (played Gandalf and used PoL to discard 7 cards; only another Gandalf and Radagast's Cunning left in my hand)

 

5th round: Hunter of Mordor

WP vs Threat: +8

Yes, Radagast's Cunning saved my day, had the card from the start and kept it all way long after getting these two early clues. I had to pay my last resource for it, the rest was invested in Gandalf's Return. My WP was at 12, threat in the staging area at 6 - and I had 2 cards left to use them for PoL. I'm still grinning.

Yeah, I sometimes let my phone record a session because it sometimes is annoying to remember how I played the cards.

Ah yeah forgot about that. I played with Eowyn, Aragorn and Theodred. And I used 3 core sets and 1 AP.

One correction:

 

2nd round WP vs Threat should be +5, as Éowyn already had Celebrian's Stone attached. Doesn't change anything though.

I understand the Forced effect on Stage 1B as still part of the Quest Phase based on the following from the FAQ (1.24):

Any Forced or passive effects initiated by questing successfully resolve before physically placing progress tokens.

Since placing the tokens marks the end of the Quest Resolution, I think your score of 53 stands. happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]
