Hey guys.  If Aragorn and Gimli each have Vigilant Guard and Legolas takes two damage from an attack can I pass one damage to Gimli and then one damage to Aragorn and then over to Gimli so that Gimli takes both damage?  I assume yes?  This card maybe should have been unique.

It depends on the correct interpretation of "assign" and "place" in regard to damage.

Good point.  They would most likely (and should) rule assign is different than place.

Assigning and placing damage are supposed to happen at different steps of damage dealing, as per RR Damage [http://www.lotr-lcg-quest-companion.gamersdungeon.net/#Rule515]:

>  3. Place the damage on the target (character or enemy).

However, the wording on card effects re: damage seems a bit inconsistent. Take this ruling, for example, where the placing of VG seems to be firing the dealing trigger of Mithril Shirt (for now…):

I'm not sure what exactly Caleb wants regarding these issues, so I think it's best to ask. FWIW, I'd rule that the OP's scenario is just fine.
