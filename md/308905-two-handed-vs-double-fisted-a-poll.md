During episode 5 of Late of the Rings I mentioned playing a two player game solo and called it playing "Double Fisted".

This naming has caused some debate. So it's time to settle it with democracy: An internetÂ poll!

I am not sure if it is possible to insert a poll here at FFG so please either let me know your thoughts as a reply here, or follow either of the links below to register a vote at either BGG or Twitter.

I will reveal the results in episode 6.

Â 

Q. When playing two decks as a solo player, what do you call this?

 * A.Â Playing Two Handed
 * B. Playing Double Fisted
 * C.Â Something else entirely (let us know what)

A

Edit: My justification for going with that convention?Â I never hold a "fistful" of cards (can't stand the thought of damaging them like that). And as per the rules, each player has a "hand of cards." Hence two-handed when playing solo with two decks.

A for me also.

When I saw the title of this thread, my first thought was "Aren't they the same thing?".

A; largely because my mind is always in the gutter with the other term ðŸ¤£

A, Double Fisted seems a bit too much "porn"

A, double fisted is a meme.

A, in most card games it's called a hand of cards so that makes more sense to meÂ and if I put my cards in a fist they would become bent.

Seems an easy win for A

Two-Handed

Have encountered that usage all over, but have never encountered (B) until this question.

A is the convention.

Â 

Never heard anyone use the B term.Â Â
