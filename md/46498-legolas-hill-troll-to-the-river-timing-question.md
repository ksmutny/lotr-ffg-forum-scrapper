# [Legolas -- Hill Troll -- To the River timing question](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46498-legolas-hill-troll-to-the-river-timing-question/)

"To the River" has 8 progress tokens on it. There is no active location. Legolas participates in an attack that kills the Hill Troll. Does quest advancement happen before of after I'm allowed to use Legolas's response?

If before: To the River increases to 10 progress tokens, then advancement, then Anduin Passage stays at 0 progress.

If after: To the River stays at 8 progress tokens, then advancement, then Legolas adds 2 progress tokens to Anduin Passage.

 

Does the rulebook support either scenario?

Meh. My before and after are backwards, and I can't edit the post. But the question remains the same.

yah this is a interesting one, since the quest should advance immediately to the next stage once the required amount of progress tokens are placed on the card.

I'd be inclined to place the tokens from legolas on the current quest for killing the troll, remove the troll from play, then advance the quest. I can see where the confusion comes from though, since you could easily argue the other point.

 The quest is completed immediately, so Legolas counters will be put on the new one.

Legolas ability waits until the end of the combat phase, and so occurs after the change of quest.

This has been ruled like that on the french official forums.

Thanks for the update from the French forums, but I find the part I quoted highly unlikely.
