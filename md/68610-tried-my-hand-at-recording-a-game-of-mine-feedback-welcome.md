 Hello Forum,

I just experimented with recording my games as I want to make some more videos in the future. If you are interested in the video or want to help me out with some feedback, feel free to watch the short (< 15 minutes) video of me playing a Rohan Rush deck vs. Passage Through Mirkwood and let me know what you think.

(I already spotted one mistake: Imrahil should have taken 1 extra damage on turn 1 as I forgot to fully resolve the attack. Guess that happens when you try to make the video short)

 





 

Thx for watching

Video wise it was good. Sound and image quality was good.

You might want to consider pausing a little bit over cards you play to give people time to read it.

But other than that I think it was a very good first video.

(Oh and I posted a question at YouTube for you ;-) )

Ive just watched it and thought it was excellently done. The sound was good and your commentary was perfectly done, describing what was going on all the time. I particularly enjoyed the speed at which you played, there was no messing about. Well done anyway and i hope you make many more.  It would be interesting to see your attempts at Dol Guldur as this bugger gets me every time solo!

Thank you very much.

You sir, sound like a sadist for suggesting this :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

But honestly, I am not sure Escape from Dol Guldur would make for an interesting video as it is 

A) very hard solo (obviously)

B) The wins tend to be rather lucky. 

 

I think neither complete encounter stomps, nor lucky wins would be too interesting to watch. But I might give it a try anyway. The next videos are going to demo my Gloin Engine deck vs. varying quests. Will probably publish them on Thursday.

Got it and it goes back to my previous point of "hovering" over cards to recap effects triggered, letting the view read the effect or at least be reminded.

I had completely forgot about the Travel Effect there (obviously) and was: "What? Ready? Why?"

 That is certainly something I have to keep in mind. While I don't like to drag my videos out too long, there seems to be no harm in hovering over the "current" card while talking.

Thx for the feedback

I am curious, what program are you using to play the LOTR LCG on your computer please?

 I would just like to ad that there's a nice plugin for the program lackeyccg also. I'm only mentioning this af octgn, great program no doubt about it, don't respect FFG's 6 month rule regarding "redistributing" the cards. FFG could get these program's closed if they wanted to, but has allowed the use IF the creators respect their demand, that all cards must have been in the stores for at least 6 months. After that they are "fine" with this kind of distribution. And that's what octgn doesn't respect. Great program as I said, but if you can just play the game online with all the new cards as soon as they get out, people will over time stop buying the cards, and the game will die.

With lackey it's the plugin programmer that decide if they wanna respect this kind of thing or not, and the guy making the LotR plugin, tragictheblathering, doo respect this.

Just wanted to let people know what they go into. Everyone is free to choose of cause :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] and sorry for side tracking

 I think it's more about users creating the sets than OCTGN itself. They can only prosecute the person and servers that share it. Anyway FFG, made a great game. I only play the cards that I also own in print on OCTGN. Is that what FFG said? That people can reproduce their cards 6 months after release? If that is true this company earned enormous respect with me. Same as wotc and MTG has lost my respect completely with their greediness.

And I completely agree with you. The price of the sets is about right. And they should be protected. With many people actually preferring playing it on the computer rather than storing all the boxes and cards and messing with tokens I think this may be dangerous for the game. Many people will prefer to play it for free rather than paying and messing with boxes and cards, tokens and card sleeves. And as you said, this can kill the game.

 Well, FFG is in no danger of losing my business to these computer emulations of board games. I've tried Lackey and Vassal and both are just exercises in frustration. It's much easier to play with cards and bits on a table than on a computer.

agreed- it find it incredibly boring. though each for their own i suppose, and i guess its far easier to record a play session on the pc than the real thing
