Been playing fog on the barrow downs as a single scenario (only three Heros) and haven't beat it. Just wondering maybe I could add a fellowship hero to give me a boost but still not play campaign mode. Just wondering if anyone has any comments about it.

Or maybe that's the way it's made to be played, with four heros, and I'm not playing right.

I know the regular saga quests must always have the ringbearer whether you are playing campaign or not.  You would definitely have one if you are playing Fog on the Barrow Downs as part of a campaign.  If you are playing it non-campaign, I think it would be optional.  That's the beauty of co-op games anyway; you can do whatever you want to.

Yeah stupid question but for some reason I only played with three heros. Now maybe I can win; yeah who am i fooling.

Fog on the Barrow Downs is indeed a tough one. I only finally got through it with some aggressive questing and a lot of luck!
