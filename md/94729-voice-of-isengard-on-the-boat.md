Was just perusing the upcoming page on here and noticed the Voice of Isengard changed from being at the production stage to being on the boat. We should expect news very soon and to be in stores most likely in January I think...

 

Can't wait to play the new quests and construct new Rohan and Doomed decks. Here's hoping that the other hero is Haldir, who appeared to be spoiled accidentally so long ago.

Rohan mono tactics and Rohan spirit tactics decks are gonna be AWESOME.

The deluxe expansions always has two heroes of spheres to fill the gap from the core set following a central theme. This strongly suggests that there will be a lore Rohan hero in the box.

This is good news. I thought we might not see it until March. Happy to be wrong.

Haldir (or what it seemed to be him) was spoiled on the Voice of Isengard page, right where Éomer is. For a couple of hours (maybe more) there was the picture of an elf. Later it was changed by the Rohirrim.

If you call just the art of a possibly elf hero to be a Haldir spoiler, then yeah. But the art does seem to be Haldir. I don't think Rohan will be the whole focus of this expansion.

I was hoping it was Arwen. Btw, I think there is an extremely good chance we won't get an elf hero (or heroine) until the adventure packs.

it would be a nice little surprise if a character we're not anticipating came out of left field and was the second hero, but as lengthily discussed elsewhere I personally think the removed Haldir (assuming it is infact Haldir) art is just too much of a coincidence.

Great news, I hope we have a word soon

Nice, it's looking like first quarter 2014 meant January as supposed to March.

Yes. I read on the website that when it moves to "on the boat" status that means we should expect it to arrive in stores in 4-6 weeks. So, at the earliest, beginning of January, at the latest, mid-January.

 

As for the second hero, although I am still pulling for Haldir, I would not be surprised if we saw Treebeard instead, since at least one of the quests in this expansion will be going into Fangorn Forest it seems from the previews. I don't think it is likely, but it would also make sense for him to show up. If so, he would probably be similar to Beorn from the Hobbit Saga, in that he will be beefy and strong, but have some sort of immunity built in. Fun to speculate at least...

Rohan, Silvan, Dunland, Ents- I can't ask for better cycle.

I don't think that we will see Treebeard as a hero in VoI. I am quite sure he will be objective-ally.

Or maybe just an ally, but I think in the Saga expansions. I find it hard to imagine Treebeard as a hero, he always should be an ally in my opinion, at least if they're never making wizard heroes.

Treebeard would make an awesome hero, but I would be inclined to agree that they will most likely make him an objective ally for one of the quests, or perhaps a player card ally.  What sphere do you think he'd fit into?  I would venture to guess Lore or perhaps even Neutral to reflect the demeanor that Ents wish to have nothing to do with the outside world.

This topic reminded me of a Tales from the Cards blog contest not too long ago in which several people designed their own Ent player cards:  http://talesfromthecards.wordpress.com/2013/06/25/create-an-ent-contest-vote-for-a-winner/ [http://talesfromthecards.wordpress.com/2013/06/25/create-an-ent-contest-vote-for-a-winner/]

 

The first card on that page, the Treebeard hero card, is definitely my favorite; think of the possibilities with that Shepherd of the Forest!

Yeah, good points about Treebeard most likely not being a hero card. If he were to be an ally, I think he might fall best in the Lore or Spirit sphere, but you, Karlson, make a good case for the neutral sphere as well. If anything, hopefully we at least see him as an objective ally in one of the quests.
