 I just noticed they moved it from July 20th to July 22nd and have pushed back the other Adventure Packs accordingly (Conflict at the Carrock: Sept 1; Journey to Rhosgobel Sept 22; Hill of Emyn Muil October 24th). 

Any idea how valid these are?

Amazon dates for games are generally completely unreliable.
