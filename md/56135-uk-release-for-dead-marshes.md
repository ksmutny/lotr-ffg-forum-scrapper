The foreign editions are published and organized by companies based in those countries, they only need to wait for the sale date confirmation by FFG and on they go. The UK stores need to import the APs from the USA I guess (its even worse for Australians). But then: My local fantasy store got Dead Marshes only yesterday whereas in the big German cities you could get it on the 3rd November already.

Lucky you. Few weeks...

IN Ukraine from all the Mirkwood cycle we have only Rhosgobel. I'll be happy to have at least HfG this year here.

I'm in Australia and I only got Hills of Emyn Muil a week ago. I think it will be at least another 3 weeks before dead marshes arriives

The Dead Marshes is appearing on ebay UK via various UK companies now. A few days ago it was just US companies selling it. Ordered mine :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
