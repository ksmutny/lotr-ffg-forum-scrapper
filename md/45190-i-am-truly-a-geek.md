In anticipation of this game I just purchased the sound track from amazon: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000TAZBK [http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000TAZBK]

Sadly no, you are not. Since i know about this game, i keep watching the movies and play LotrO. I used to try developing solo rules for old MECCG without so much success. That game is a dream come true, awesome artwork too.

Hallo :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

How can u call Yourself a geek if You purchase the Soundtrack to the Greatest Film ever 10 Years after release???gran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif]

The real geek would ask whether:

1. A Knife in The Dark is proper for the encounter phase in which no Nazgul Character Participates.

2. Every time players cennot settle the strategy should be accompanied by The Braking of the Fellowship.

3. Only The Prophecy can be played while shuffling the Encounter Deck.

4. Once one of Your heros is wounded and You suspect it will not survive Shadow effect do You have to start playing Amon Hen.

5. If you play 2 Rohirrim ally cards do you have to play The Ride of the Rohirrim twice?

6. Can You sometimes swap The Gray Havens with Into the West after You beat chain of quests on nightmare difficulty settings.

7. In "Search for Gollum" chapter do You have to listen to Gollum's Song over and over again until you find enough clues?

So Your actual question seems a little bit puny to all of us, who with trembling fingers try to learn to  sing The Steward of Gondor song in preparation to situation when one of the players is eliminated from the game.

aww... you should have bought the COMPLETE RECORDINGS! They're amazing! I have all three so I can play for 11 hours with out a break in music, instead of just 3! Ha Ha! I love putting the CDs on when I'm playing Middle Earth Quest and now I'll do the same for LOTR LCG. If you like the music Doug Adams also has a great book out that looks at all the themes in the music and comes with a bonus CD of previously unreleased music and mock ups of the themes.

really if you were totally a geek you would have downloaded it from a torrent site using a torrent program you built yourself using parts from an old commodore 64 and a toaster while playing World of Warcraft and pwning noobs. lol. That's about as geeked out as I can make that sentence.

Just ask your self,wen was the last time i traveled to New Zealand and saw Hobbiton with my own eyes?If the answer is never then you need a lot of work if you want to be a proud geeklengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif].

 I'm far too busy getting anxiety attacks whenever I think about talking to girls to have time to be a geek.... 

## 12 [ffgfan on April 15, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45190-i-am-truly-a-geek/?do=findComment&comment=454077)

You're not the only geek. I got all the Tolkien books, all versions of the movie with Extended and all the soundtracks including Complete Soundtracks to all three movies. And now I can't wait for the game. And hope to get it before Easter in my hands.

I'm actually pouring over the rules and watching the tutorials over and over. That's pretty geeky for me. This is heresy, I know, but I was never that fond of the LotR novels. However I really loved the movies and own them all. But I read the novels when I was a fairly young child, and with a better grasp of the story I might enjoy them much more now.

 

In any case, I'm itchin' to play this game. I've never tried a solo game that I found really satisfying, but I think this might the one that does. Having said that, my wife is actually interested. She doesn't like competitive games, but she likes Middle Earth, and the concept of a cooperative game really appeals.

Although she's not in the same Geek league as some of the posters on this thread, can people confirm my suspicion that my wife is the ONLY person in the world to have read the Silmarilion 5 times, but the Hobbit only once?!!?

## 15 [Sky on April 16, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45190-i-am-truly-a-geek/?do=findComment&comment=454554)

As I belong to MAN species I cannot be sure about how WOMEN tribe cope with your inquiry. I have read Hobbit once or Twice, but Silmarillion i have read a few Times - three times I am sure of, maybe more. These two books are from different leagues :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] There are a lot of reasons one could return to in Silmarillion...

Not quite the only one in the world, my wife has done the same. happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]

I got all the cd's along with the collector editions of the 3 movies years ago. And what can be more atmospheric than having the Uruk Hai's scimitar and the Legolas' knives hanging on your wall?

A true LOTR collector.

MECCG had official solo rules that worked well.

The soundtrack is a great idea. The movies in the background may be a bit distracting, music only is probably the way to stay focussed on the game.
