Just looking through the recent new nightmare decks and suddenly noticed THIS sentence:

 

 * One rules sheet for optional The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game competitive play

There it goes……..

Who cares? Cardboard of the Rings Ep. 36 addressed the matter of competitive play very well, IMO. If there were a good system it would have already appeared. Why turn a co-op game into something adversarial? Then we end up with some veteran players who intentionally screw new players, etc. like in MTG and other games, keeping the player pool smaller. I'd rather see some sort of EXP or Badge system emerge. Maybe it's hokey, but I don't think that turning this co-op/solo game competitve will go well.

Now I'll sit back and wait to be attacked.

perhaps….but i will agree with john here, and not just because im a solo player….

more of the players out there play exclusively solo over any other type of play (see my play poll [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=694006]), so i dont think it would be a success

now of course the idea is 'optional', but if ffg are releasing content that a large amount of players arent going to buy i dont think its a good idea.

its worth remembering that although the US has a large player base on this forum and others, other countries arent so lucky. theres about 10 or less UK players here, and this makes the chances of finding competitors in your area very slim indeed. i certainly know no one in the whole of northern england on this forum. ive never seen any of the cards in any stores in a 100 miles radius (not that there are any) so events are pretty much out of it

so..if it aint broke….(make it better??)….or leave it.

rich

PS. just seen it was a reference to a rules sheet and not any other content. surely ffg will have to make dedicated content? so re-reading the OP its basically just a mod to the original rules.

doesnt seem worth it to me…..

I completely love the cooperative spirit of this game. That being said, I also think it would be fun (and appeal to a certain population) to have a competitive structure to participate in. This doesn't mean the game's changing in anyway, we're just comparing scores or some other aspect of play to eachother to win a prize. I think this will work because it's already built into the system and people are doing it naturally anyway (look at all the tournaments on the community page…). Anyway, I'm excited about the possibilites with this!

I have no interest in competitve play, but I'm sure other folks will.  And one thing, rich…!

I don't think your poll can be called representative of any popluation other than "players who visit the forums."

that is true, but unless ffg want to input here with some official stats, its the only thing we have to go on…. it would be interesting to see what the actual statistics were of play types…..hard as that data would be to come by.

if we assume for a moment that most serious players of this game visit the forum, then i would say that the poll is at least a good indication of player types, though of course its certainly not conclusive

i may try the same poll on bbg one day….it would be interesting to see what comes up there

I can't wait for tournaments/a competitive scene! I also don't really agree with John85's and other's assessment at all. Nowhere does it say it will change the game or make it adversarial and I don't think you give a lot of people much credit to say players will just screw over new players.

I think the competitive scene will do something like: each round of the tournament you are teamed with 1 or 2 or 3 other players in the tournament and you'll have to work together and help each other to make it through a quest and earn a win for everyone. Then you're teamed with a new group each round and repeat 3 or 4 or 5 times and whichever players at the end have the most wins maybe win the event but you still had to work with others to get there.

It's that sort of teamwork that I love about the cooperative aspect in this game and the same sort of teamwork that I think will lead to players more often helping other players instead of hindering them.

For people who like going to tournaments, or interacting with other folks who play the same game or like the same hobbies, this will be a great thing.
