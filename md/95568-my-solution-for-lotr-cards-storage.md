Beautifully handcrafted pieces.

Man that looks awesome!

Great craftsmanship mate.

Out of curiosity, how many cards can 1 box store?

As they look quite big on the pictures.

And how much would 1 cost me if I'd order one??

Speachless!! That is just amazing!! As Noccus asked, How many cards in one box and what is the price on one of these treasures?

hi guys, im so glad you like my creation!

 

the size of this box is big, let's say that i can easly put all my cards ( ive got all the expansion out untill now + first nightmare pack ) in the bottom of the box, the one with the hobbit map, and i have also 10 slots for adventure card and personal deck.... but im quite crazy so i put in each slot a different set of card, in the first the spider of mirkwood in the second orcs of dul guldur and so on... in this way i still have the half of the top part ( the one with the LOTR map ) empty, let's say for future expansions :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

the "price part" is hard to say....it depends, ive done very small box: 50 euro. but also bigger than this: 500 euro. Also i try to not replicate a box when somebody ask me to craft one, so it depends from materials painting, drawing and stuff like that, each one of my box is personal and unique, i remember one box in particular for warhammer invasions LCG, with the Bloodthirster paint took me 3 month: 750 euro :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]!!!

 

So in conclusion ive done this box for me, and ive done it bigger than necessary, also if you like one i can do pretty much whatever you guys want, size or painting dosent matter :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

That is a pretty amazing piece of work. Well done! I will certainly buy something like this if I still have people to play TCG with when I finish my studies and get a job.

it's a shame you didn't create this 1 month ago hahaha

 

i would have purchased from you and saved myself the trouble :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

got any pictures of the box with the cards inside?  is each compartment used for an AP?

 

just curious how you organize things because i'm already rethinking storage to make things more compact.  

i want a one box solution like you!

 

thanks in advance!
