Thanks for the list, I have a long 3-6 day wait ahead of me, depending on how long my box takes to reach me. this makes things much better, though.

Legolas says that when he kills an enemy, put two progress counters on the current quest. I guess those bonus counters never go to the location, because card text overrides rulebook text. I don't know if this is an advantage or drawback.

Well, I'm off to see which of the 2x and 1x per core set cards I will want more of. Thanks again!

I wouldn't read Legolas that way.  He tells you to ""place 2 progress tokens on the current quest."   I know that card texts overrides rule text, but Legolas' rules don't use the phrase "quest card," which is the phrase used in the rule book.  There may be a difference between "the current quest" and "the current quest card".

I am inclined to agree. The card text (in these sorts of games) tends to be quite explicit. That is, "it says what it means and it means what it says".

But don't take that as sarcasm DrNate. I don't mean it as such. Take for granted that I do not have my copy of the game yet, but I have read the rules fairly thoroughly. My understanding is that you don't have to engage a location. That adds quite a bit of threat... but.. in this case what if you were close to finishing off the quest entirely. You draw a location, but you also have an enemy you can take out. It might make more sense to take out the enemy and score the two quest tokens (and therefore finishing the quest!), rather than fooling with the location at all.

And that might be the relative strength and value of Legolas; the ability to still gain quest tokens on the main quest even though you're otherwise blocked by locations.

Of course, I may be wrong. I just agree with Bohemond.

Darksbane when you click on an ally or hero card it changes willpower to wisdom on the individual card page.

Yeah, I noticed that too.  Your card text description are stating "Wisdom" instead of the correct "Willpower".  For example look at the text for Eowyn:

http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/core/eowyn-core [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/core/eowyn-core]

"Action: Discard 1 card from your hand to give Éowyn +1 Wisdom until the end of the phase. This effect may be triggered by each player once each round."

 

That is incorrect.  It should be:

"Action: Discard 1 card from your hand to give Éowyn +1 Willpower until the end of the phase. This effect may be triggered by each player once each round."

 

This mistake is pervasive throughout all the text descriptions on your site.

Thank you! For some reason I just couldn't figure out which one was missing, was driving me crazy.

Wisdom issue should be fixed for all cards. Thanks for the heads up everyone. If you see any other errors or have any other suggestions let me know. I'm going to go through the pages tomorrow and make sure that everything has the appropriate information in the text version of the spoilers and try to make sure it is readable.
