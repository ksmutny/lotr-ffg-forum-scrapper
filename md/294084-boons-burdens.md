How the Boons & Burdens should be used?
if we earned them do we need to add them to the decks for the future scenarios in the campaign, or not? I mean...are we forced to use them in future campaign scenarios ?

Some have the permanent keyword, meaning they are put into play while you do the setup, the others must be added to their respective decks (encounter or player). Some scenarios will instruct you about which boons and burden earned in certain scenarios you must add or remove for that specific scenario's setup.
