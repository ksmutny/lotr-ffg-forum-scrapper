# [Khazad-dum expansion - the player cards](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56891-khazad-dum-expansion-the-player-cards/)

So far, it looks like we know half the player cards in the set, including all the Spirit cards.  Is there anything else we know that I am missing?

Card # - Title - (sphere and type)

1  Dwalin (Spirit Hero)

2  Bifur (Lore Hero)

3  Narvi's Belt (Leadership Attachment)

4  Durin's Song (this is card 4 or card 5)  (Leadership Event)

5  ???  (Leadership card)

6  Veteran of ? (Probably a dwarf, full name unknown.  This is card 6 or card 7)  (Tactics Ally)

7  ???  (Tactics card)

8  Khazad! Khazad!  (Tactics Event)

9  Zigil Miner (Spirit Ally)

10 Untroubled by Darkness (Spirit Event)

11 ??? (Lore card)

12 Ancestral Knowledge (Lore Event)

13 ??? (Neutral card)

Of the 165 cards in the box, 35 are player cards (2 heroes and 11 x 3 = 33 other player cards).  That leaves 130 cards that are either encounter cards or quest cards.  There are 9 new encounter sets in the box.  On the spoiled encounter cards it lists how many total cards there are in each of those sets.  See my post further down this thread for info on the encounter card set sizes.

"During's Song" Leadership attachment, you can see it under a bunch of cards in the first Khazad-dum preview. Obviously it gives +2 Willpower and something else as an action (the rest is hidden)

I'm so excited.

Are you sure about 3 player cards for each sphere? I always assumed the expansion will only include two per sphere. I bet they will also include neutral cards.

Even if we have 100 encounter cards, this still leaves us with around 60 player cards. 3x4x4 = 48 sounds perfectly reasonable, so 4 cards per sphere. Who knows, maybe it will be 5 cards per sphere , assuming there are no neutrals.

Did anybody try to analyze card numbers and find any patterns ?

## 4 [Shelfwear on November 28, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56891-khazad-dum-expansion-the-player-cards/?do=findComment&comment=561245)

Lets see:

There will be 9 quest sets in Khazad-dum: In the core set there were 7 encounter sets with 9-14 cards each, thats 100-110 encounter cards. Then there will be the quest cards for (supposedly) 4 quests, adding 12-16 more cards. So the quest/encounter cards will sum up around 120 cards plus 2 heroes, leaving approx 40 player cards. Seems that there will be 3 for each sphere (3 each) plus 1 neutral. But these are just wild guesses... there could be even 4 player cards but 5 I strongly doubt.

## 5 [guciomir on November 28, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56891-khazad-dum-expansion-the-player-cards/?do=findComment&comment=561262)

Ah I just realized that Bryon compared the numbers... Good work!

We will indeed get max 3 cards per sphere. Leadership will have slots 3,4,5. Tactic will take 6,7,8. Spirit will have 9, 10 and I guess also 11. While Lore will take 12, 13, 14. So there will be 3x3x4 = 36 players cards, maybe some more if we have neutrals.

## 6 [BoundForGlory on November 28, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56891-khazad-dum-expansion-the-player-cards/?do=findComment&comment=561295)

This is all I could find about the card counts for each of the 9 encounter sets:

Orc head? symbol - 13 cards (Plundered Armory is card 12 of 13)

Torch symbol - 17 cards (Branching Paths is card 5 of 17)

Book symbol - 9 cards (Cave Troll is card 1 of 9)

Mining pick-axe symbol - 12 cards (Patrol Leader is card 1 of 12)

Tentacle symbol - ?? cards (Doors of Durin is card ? of ??)

Moon with tree outline? symbol - ?? cards

other symbol - ?? cards

other symbol - ?? cards

other symbol - ?? cards

So, 4 known encounter sets have a total of 51 cards, then the next 5 will likely have about 60 to 65 cards (assuming an average of 12 or 13 cards per encounter set), for a total of about 115 encounter deck cards.  I think they said there will be 3 new adventures in the box, and I assume 3 quest cards per adventure, for a total of 9 quest cards.

115 encounter cards + 9 quest cards + 2 heroes + 30 player cards = 156 cards

They announced 165 cards in this expansion.  So, either there are more encounter cards, more quest cards, or more player cards (or a combination).  I am most excited about the encounter cards, so I hope we get more of those.

Also, don't forget that there will be adventure packs coming out for it as well :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

It has already been revealed months ago over at the French version of this site that there will be a total of 11 (different) player cards in this expansion: www.edgeent.com/v2_fr/edge_foros_discusion.asp [http://www.edgeent.com/v2_fr/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=181&efcid=11&efidt=159959]

So, no need to speculate gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]

No, we can speculate about other things now :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

11 player cards is an odd number (when we assume that every sphere will be treated equally) because then you dont get 3 different cards per sphere. And 2 different cards per sphere plus 3 neutral cards feels odd too and isnt covered by the card numbers revealed so far (unless they introduce neutral items/artifacts). Maybe they will introduce multi/dual-sphere cards?

I'm guessing that my top post is correct and that card #13 is a neutral card.

Does anyone know why I can't edit my first post anymore?  The "edit" link was there yesterday, but now it is gone.

EDIT: nevermind, the edit link reappeared after I published this post.  Odd.

I haven't seen that! is it online anywhere? or just in the hard-copy magazine?

I have not seen the picture of it either.  I just saw the post on boardgamegeek:  http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/716518/new-cards-leaked-in-gtm-november-2011 [http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/716518/new-cards-leaked-in-gtm-november-2011]

2 spheres will get 2 new cards x3

2 spheres will get 3 new cards x3

1 neutral card x3

2 Heroes

= 35 players cards

(this distribution was revealed on the french board)

Thanks for the confirmation.  I'll edit my first post with that info.

Also, I think that the Tentacle symbol (that appears on Doors of Durin card in the Dwarrowdelf intro article) is actually from the Dwarrowdelf cycle Adventure pack 3, and is not one of the 9 symbols from Khazad-Dum.  But I am not certain.

Does anyone else think that this distribution is a bit odd? Until now they spread out the player cards out evenly between all the spheres and now that. And will we have to wait until the next big box expansion to see the other two spheres getting their extra cards? Hm...

It does seem a bit odd, but I think you are right.  The next big box expansion might have 2 heroes (Leadership and Tactics), and then short the leadership and tactics player cards by one each in order to even out the card totals for each sphere.

Do we know what Durin Song does? Will it be a song (so minstrel can fetch it)?

## 20 [BoundForGlory on December 26, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56891-khazad-dum-expansion-the-player-cards/?do=findComment&comment=571510)

I assume it will be a song.  It is an event, though, so it will be a little different.  I think you get to choose +2 willpower, +2 attack, or +2 defense for a hero (or dwarf character?) for one turn.  That is a guess based on what few words we saw on the preview card, which was mostly obscured by another card in front of it.
