I don't think this is the big announcement. I think they have something else planned for the Fellowship Event. Also, a new cycle makes me think Core 2.0 is less likely to happen.

I really do hate to be that guy, but this is about what I expected.  I'm glad the game is alive for sure, but normally this is announced before gencon and we get it around Christmas.  So the real news is "our schedule has slipped".  Now this is supposedly available in the first quarter of 2018... well Cirith Gurat going to be available in the first quarter of 2017.  So I guess I know what I'll be getting for next Christmas.

P.S.  If they really do announce something bigger tomorrow, I'll come in here and eat crow after the Fellowship tournament.

Wow, this all looks really cool. Bard is really good, but by far Necklace of Girion is my favorite card of this announcement. And it's an Artifact! I'm really looking forward to some developing of the Artifact trait during the cycle, much like we're getting Item support in the deluxe. Hopefully that could mean some Istari heroes. Also, hopefully we'll see some drakes and dragons during the cycle as well!

And I don't actually think this will be the announcement, as it was teased that it was only going to be released tomorow and they are even livestreaming it. No reason for it to release it before that. It has to be someting different, but I could be wrong.

Later you get +2 wp *and* an extra resource each round.  That's well worth the cost, I think.  The article says that the card is *added* to staging, so hopefully it's not revealed either.

Yes. It's good, not great. I think I would like it if it was Guarded Enemy or Guarded Location only. You could build around engaging an enemy or placing progress on a location to clear it out before questing, but this way you're at the mercy of the encounter deck unless you're scrying. I'm sure it will be a nice bonus in certain decks as a resource smoother, but it seems like it could be a win more card.

Guarded does, but Guarded (X) says to add -- I just checked the Black Serpent rules to be sure.  This is a Guarded (X) card.

Please don't eat crows.


As for the reveal, I got several things to say:

1. I like the new item theme;

2. I hate how they just obscure some player card texts on the previews, as per usual;

3. Bard son of Brand? I am a bit confused. I thought Bard the Bowman was the founder? Educate me, loremastas;

4. I do think that these are the big promised news, because what can be bigger?

I hope there's more like it.  I love Dunedain Pathfinder and Dunedain Hunter.

With the 5th pack *finally* out and the 6th pack already known, it's good to have some cards to look forward to.  Hopefully the humongous delay on the current cycle will allow them to get the next cycle out quicker -- they've had plenty of time to playtest.

Get your appetite ready. I, for once, have faith in tomorrow's event delivering us something different to today's news.

Excited for the trading theme qith Dale.

Hoping, like Gizlivaldi, to see on the following cycle some drake related content. For now,we go back to the roots. Spiders and orcs.

Oh and Journey Up the Anduin... see what they did there...

Bard II is the son of Brand and succeeded him as King of Dale.  Thorin III Stonehelm succeeded Dain, maybe he's the other hero.

Just wanna fawn over the Necklace some more. I just love how the designers open the deckbuilding space by giving us occacionally these neutral resource generating attachments that are more balanced than Steward of Gondor by having some sort of drawback. First Rescourceful, then Keys of Orthanc and now Necklace of Girion. Even Magic Ring is kind of like that too. I really hope they keep opening the possibilities of different decks being on the same level, without depending so much on staples like Steward of Gondor. Even though I'm mostly curious and excited for this next cycle (as we kinda knew what the Dale expansion would explore in terms of quests) I think I'm already gonna love the new themes and player cards in this expansion.

Wow, really liking the new Item mechanics, that's pretty cool. 

My partner pointed out how great it is that the Long Lake Trader lets two characters share a single copy of a Weapon or Armor Attachment. Or passing around A Burning Brand!

Bard the Bowman's son was Bain. Bain's son was Brand. Brand's son was named after his great grandfather, Bard. 

It confused me when I first saw it too.

Long Lake Trader + Spare Hood and Cloak basically lets you exhaust any of your characters to ready any other character every round. Pretty good!

It's in the article:

"When a card with the Guarded (enemy) or Guarded (location) keyword enters play, you will discard cards from the encounter deck until a card of the indicated type is discarded. Then, you add that card to the staging area and attach the Guarded card to it as a guarded objective."

Necklace of Girion looks amazing. The other player cards definitely look like there's going to be a lot of interesting possibilities.

I also like that apparently the first quest is Journey *Up* the Anduin.

## 34 [GrandSpleen on December 8, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/264977-the-wilds-of-rhovanion-this-is-the-new-big-announcement/?do=findComment&comment=3116630)

I like it!  Cool symmetry with the core set & first cycle.  

Bard son of Brand is going to make it easier to play attachments onto allies.  Less risky, as you can get the attachment back if the ally dies.  Raiment of War is already great, he makes it better.  And Warrior of Dale looks like the perfect target-- his text looks to reduce the cost to play attachments on him.

I think that Long Lake Trader is going to be a very nice card to have in the card pool, opening up LOTS of flexibility with attachments.  Who wants to pass Magic Ring or Horn of Gondor around the table at need?  You do need each player to have their own copy of him, though.  There's a small synergy with him and Renewed Friendship [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR?Query=Renewed%20Friendship], but you have to plan for it.   Player A has an attachment he wants for himself.  He plays it on Player B, who uses Renewed Friendship on Player A, granting card draw, readying (harder to use), or threat reduction.  Player B can then use Long Lake Trader to pass the attachment back.  Player B got the opportunity to use the attachment one time, if it's useful to him like Silver Harp, Keys of Orthanc, or Rod of the Steward could be.

To Arms! looks like it will in some way boost an ally who has a player card attachment on him.

So I'm starting to warm to the "treasure" mechanic and wondered "How long until they make a card that must attach to a quest card in play?"

Hmm ... might have to come back.  This is an area I'd really like to explore.

I've skipped Haradrim because the location and theme didn't interest me, and have expansions and packs yet unopened because I got frustrated with difficulty levels of some expansions. As much as I love Middle Earth for its theme and lore, after playing the Arkham Horror LCG the LotR mechanics are just painful.

One can only hope they'll also go full circle on difficulty levels for those who just want to build fun decks. <Currently beating my head against Lost Realm and Saga campaign and feeling pretty down on the game>

Guarded can be way worse than Doomed though.  Would contribute excellently to a grief deck. If everyone plays a Guarded card on turn 1, that’s 4 extra cards. Or if 1 player plays 3 of them... Anyway, the card is awesome, but I see these things getting very little use in multiplayer.

True.  It could help if they are all unique, but that also would make them less desirable in a multiplayer situation.

Same. I play on Sleazy Mode which I find lessens the sting of the difficult quests, and makes up for my admittedly weak deckbuilding skills. I skipped Harad for the theme, but probably will get it someday. I need to get the Saga expansions, first, though, which appear to be mostly out of print. But I can be patient. A new cycle to jump back in on will keep me happy enough.

Yeah, this. I ultimately got through most of the Saga stuff OK (haven't done the Return of the King ones yet, though -- but the Hobbit series were great) but Lost Realm turned me off due to difficulty and I haven't touched the game in six months. I prefer more fun and thematic deck building to power decks and there are too many effects, modifiers, and attachments to keep up with board state.

I feel no shame in admitting i often opt to play some quests on easy mode, so I have fun rather than repeatedly getting my face smashed. Sometimes i want a really difficult challenge, but often i just want to enjoy the experience.

There are some quests that basically scream for it.

I always play easy mode. 

I keep a list of quests I know are too easy in easy mode, and play them normal mode.

And a short list of quests I play Nightmare mode when I feel my deck would crush even normal mode.

I still can't say my win rate is sky high, though.

I'm very happy we're finally seeing Dale, and it looks like the scenarios are heading north. So we might just see what some of us wish for: going beyond Erebor, drakes and more dragons. That'd be insanely cool. I'm excited at the trading Item theme, curious to see where it'll lead! I'm a bit surprised because it seems very specific, and the previous Dale allies are more about location control than anything. The designers seem to have developped the tribes of Middle-Earth with a lot of foreseing and theme binding lately. Maybe they just came up with the idea. That's cool anyway. Maybe some Item attachment will bind the two mechanics.

I love this!

While I understand historically how it happened, I still think it's a shame that the "levels" are labeled as they are. If they had been named something like "Narrative/Expert/Nightmare" from the start, the overall perception of the game from outside the community may have been quite different, and I think in a good way.

Anyway, that ship has sailed. Less than four hours until the big announcement!

I don't want to be that guy, but this is the first time I feel like this could be the final cycle. That's because it gives me a feel of "coming full circle". The first quest  being calles journey up the Anduin. Returning to Mirkwood (again :D). It would be a fitting end, like coming home after a long workday^^

Anyway I am excited about the new cycle and the "item focus" of the dale trait. It always sucked to loose your atachments, so I rarely put them on allies. Hopefully this will change :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Nope, we are getting another announcement most likely.

As for this being the final cycle, I could honestly live with that, as long as they finally explore my favorite themes in the player cards. Hero Saruman, Radagast, unique Palantiri and wizard-realted cards, encounter Tom & Goldberry, and player saga attachments like Sting, Glamdring, Phial, etc.

I like how they're developing Dale and Items. The player cards in this expansion might be only focused on the Dale trait, in which case Leadership Brand might be the other hero. We see Dale-related cards in every sphere, whereas The Voice of Isengard (the only deluxe to focus on two traits so far) had no Rohan-related Lore and Leadership cards (except Grima) and no cards that reference the Isengard trait in Tactics and Spirit (though thematically The Wizard's Voice and Power of Orthanc are connected to Isengard). Specifically, the fact that we're getting a Leadership event that's useless if you don't have a Dale hero makes me think there's a decent chance we're getting a Leadership Dale hero. On the other hand, The Wilds of Rhovanion covers a lot of territory, and there are plenty of possible heroes they could include. If we don't get them in the deluxe, I think there's a good chance we'll get Thranduil and Thorin Stonehelm in the following cycle. A new version of Dain Ironfoot as well as Grimbeorn the Old are other possibilities.

Since Bard son of Brand is numbered 2, the other hero should be Leadership or Tactics. Since Warrior of Dale has a bow in his art and seems to not have the Ranged keyword (Tactics Beregond, for example, has the Sentinel keyword at the beginning of his text box, before his cost-reducing ability), there's a good chance we'll get a bow (probably not racially restricted) that can attach to allies.

"Wilds of Rhovanion" but the cover art shows a sprawling walled city/fortress. Title and cover art doesn't seem to mesh.

I thought it was pretty obvious that the city depicted is Dale. Dale is part of Wilderland/Rhovanion and is the reason for a lot of the new player cards having the Dale trait. I believe the last quest in the expansion takes us there. The bird is also pretty significant. It's a thrush. It played a bigger part in the books than the films.

I think he was thrown by the "Wilds" part of the name.  Though I don't think wilds have to necessarily have no cities whatsoever.  Rather, it means that most of the land outside the cities is ungoverned (as opposed to the Shire or Gondor, which have bounds claiming quite a bit of empty land).

There is certainly trade going through Esgaroth, and I'm sure dwarves travel between Erebor and the Iron Hills, but the lands between are ungoverned and unclaimed, and even such settlements as there are could be considered wild and independent.

Fair, but it's highly unlikely to find another dragon in Rhovanian so soon after the death of Smaug. We've seen Naurlhug already, so at least in FFG's version, there are dragons living somewhere in Middle-Earth. I, for one, would be disappointed to see another one around Dale. We've already done that.

I'm thinking more of a drake/baby dragon. Maybe we discover that those goblins (from Gundabad or other near places) have on enslaved.

I for one would love to see dragons this cycle. As in, I think it's be a huge wasted opportunity if they didn't include any drakes/dragons. Now, one attacking Dale as @Network57 [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/264315-network57/] suggests would be silly, but a visit to the Withered Heath, where we know are still some left (or at least, they could make some left, like Naurlhug), would be awesome.

I think it'd be cool if we got to steal treasure from a dragon. Or maybe throw us a twist and have us help a dragon take back it's lair from a horde of goblins, in return for it not attacking Dale. How cool would a dragon objective-ally be?

I don't know...that could be interpreted a couple different ways.  "It is up to you to explore the caverns of the Iron Hills, because this card game's certainly not going there."

Actually something very cool would be a Radagast hero card that comes along with some Radagast-only toys that you can also play into the Radagast ally. That would be a nice way to revalorize the poor Radagast ally!

Unfortunately the Heroes in the cycle itself rarely have anything to do with the setting. But there are a ton of characters from this region that I would love to see as Heroes.

To name a handful: Thranduil, Dain (reprise) , Stonehelm, Grimbeorn, Gwaihir, Bofur, Radagast, maybe even old man Bain... It's actually a pretty extensive list.

This feels like the cycle for these two! It would be cool if rather than buff Silvan who enter play, Thranduil gets a boost when Silvan leave play. Still supports the bounce mechanic, but in a different way than Celeborn. Also on my wish list would be for some more non-eagle creatures for Radagast to play with.

That a little bit more than 3 months late. With a "first quarter of 2018" like announced it could be in June if it follow the same pattern.

The distance between Poros and Esgaorth is about as far as The Shire is from Minas Tirith, so it might take a while for our heroes to get there.

Don't want to overreact, but on FFG Spain website, Wilds of Rhovanion changed status from "on the boat" to "shipping" (the truck symbol) and some shops stated that the 29th May could be delivered.

Again, no overreactions. At least for me. Better for my mind.

With release date approaching, I decided to compile all the information we have about players card in this expansion, and add some educated speculation. (Some of this I found through the COTR discord.) The announcement article said that the expansion contains 2 heroes and 39 player cards (3 copies of 13), so it will have more player cards than Khazad-Dûm and The Sands of Harad, fewer player cards than Heirs of Númenor, and the same number as The Voice of Isengard, The Lost Realm, and The Grey Havens. Anything in square brackets below is speculation.

1 Brand son of Bain (fully spoiled)

2 Bard son of Brand (fully spoiled)

[3] Redwater Sentry:

mec65_a4_cardfan.png [https://images-cdn.fantasyflightgames.com/filer_public/2f/c6/2fc602d1-f848-4228-9ab0-716884b02f9d/mec65_a4_cardfan.png]

The name is confirmed through the artist's Instagram:



The text is likely: Reduce the [cost to play Armor attachments on] Redwater [Sentry by 1.] Redwater [Sentry gets +1 defense and gains sentinel] while it has [an Armor attachment.]" This is pretty much confirmed by the Spanish card fan:image.png [https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/145983826500255745/454828856935710720/image.png]

4 North Realm Lookout (spoiled in fan)

5 Warrior of Dale (fully spoiled)

6 Long Lake Trader (fully spoiled)

[7 Leadership attachment with Armor and Item traits that can attach to Redwater Sentry; almost certainly not limited to Dale characters]

8 King of Dale (fully spoiled)

9 Bow of Yew (fully spoiled)

[10 Lore Item attachment that can attach to Dale allies and likely heroes; very likely not limited to Dale characters]

11 Necklace of Girion (fully spoiled)

12 Traffic from Dale (fully spoiled)

[13] To Arms!:

mec65_cardfan_a1.png [https://images-cdn.fantasyflightgames.com/filer_public/1b/ae/1baeab8a-91aa-46f3-9d3d-e43512c84fb8/mec65_cardfan_a1.png]

The text has a good chance of being: "Action: Choose an ally with a player [attachment. Ready that ally.]"

[14 Tactics event]

[15 Lore or Neutral event]

The card numbering suggests that Necklace of Girion is the last attachment, so there should be four events. (It could be three events and a side quest, but that seems less likely since the last deluxe focused on side quests. We could also get an Encounter player card, but we just got one in The Crossings of Poros and we'll be getting one in Roam Across Rhovanion. I expect a Lore event that shuffles a player card into the Encounter deck at some point, but not here.) There are no Lore Dale heroes, and there's no way for a Dale deck to play Lore events without a sphere match (King of Dale can play off-sphere allies, and Bard son of Brand can play off-sphere Item attachments), so we might not get a Lore event in this box.

Card 7 could technically be a neutral ally, but a Leadership Armor attachment makes much more sense, especially since there's no Armor attachment from the core set (for players who get this as their first expansion) that can go on Redwater Sentry. Like Bow of Yew, it might say "Attach to a Dale or Warrior character," and given how prominent the shield is in Redwater Sentry's art, it might be a shield. 

The numbering is Leadership-Spirit-Tactics-Lore in each card type, so card 10 is likely a Lore attachment (it has a slim chance of being Tactics or Neutral). It's probably an Item, so that Bard can play it, and in a preview discussing the deluxe Caleb said the Dale trait "rewards you for playing attachments on your allies." The only attachment in the Core Set that can be played on allies is Self Preservation (which is not an item), and Bow of Yew and the Leadership Armor attachment don't seem like enough attachments for allies if a new player gets this as their first expansion (neither King of Dale nor Necklace of Girion can go on allies). It's likely a cheap, generically useful attachment that could work well on North Realm Lookout.

As a thematic player, I like getting more generic attachments (like Bow of Yew) that can thematically fit into a wide variety of decks. There's also a fair amount of room in the design space to explore attachments on allies, which can make some allies feel more like heroes (such as ally Legolas with Bow of the Galadhrim). If we never get an ally version of Aragorn, then with all these attachments for allies coming up, I hope we get one that I can play on Vigilant Dunadan to boost his willpower by 1: he could represent Aragorn in my thematic campaign (with hobbit heroes for The Black Riders) for A Knife in the Dark and Flight to the Ford, but I want him to have two willpower to be able to defend against the Witch-king and survive Power in their Terror.  I'm also still hoping for Merry and Pippin allies for The Road Darkens, for an Éomer ally (who can be Sword-thained to kill Uglúk) for the Uruk-hai, and for a Grimbold hero (to go with Gandalf and Erkenbrand in a reinforcements deck) for Helm's Deep.

I love Hauberk of Mail even outside of a Dale deck.  1-cost, +1def and +1 health on sentinel and can go on allies (if they are Dale/warrior).  Only downside is the limit 1.

Absolutely. I think it's going to be one of the most versatile cards in the box. Beregond will like it, and it will any good sentinel warrior. Plus, it ain't restricted.  Very exciting.

Only 3 resources, since the attachment cost is reduced. So good.

If you've been watching the FFI Twitch streams on the digital game, the quest "Lost in Mirkwood" is a branching, multiple paths quest that changes based on the locations you travel to. I'd assume this is similar. Quest side A or C starts a path that traveling to further objective locations continues or modified in some way. Don't know the specifics, but the similarities are too striking to be ignored.

Armor that can go on Redwater Sentry, with effective cost:

Hauberk of Mail (0-leadership)

Raiment of War (1-tactics)

Squire's Helm [future] (0-leadership)

Raiment of War + Hauberk of Mail will be amazing on him.

Weapons that can go on Warrior of Dale, with effective cost:

Raiment of War (1-tactics)

Bow of Yew (0-tactics)

Spear of the Citadel (1-tactics)

Raiment of War isn't very good on him since the defense/hp bonus is wasted.  Bow of Yew is nice on him, but the discount power is not needed.  Definitely need another weapon.

Items that can go on on North Realm Lookout, with cost

Hauberk of Mail (1-leadership)

Squire's Helm [future] (1-leadership)

Bow of Yew (0-tactics)

Grappling Hook (1-tactics)

Mariner's Compass (1-leadership)

Map of Rhovanian (1-lore)

Spare Helm and Cloak (0-spirit)

Ent Draught (1-lore)

Since he doesn't exhaust to quest with an item attached, Mariner's Compass and Spare Helm and Cloak (both of which require character exhaustion) would work well on him, though in the case of the spare helm and cloak you'd need to move it back.  Bow of Yew isn't wasted on him, since he can quest and chip in a little direct damage.

Looking forward to more weapon/armor/items in the cycle that can go on these guys.

If you want to get tricky, you can always play Elf-friend on the Warrior of Dale. That opens up Rivendell Blades and the Bow of the Galadhrim. Certainly harder to pull off, and perhaps of dubious value, but worth including for completeness sake if nothing else.

Dale archetype draw a lot of cards (each time we play an attachment) so rainment of war and hauberk of mail are enough to power up our allies  (knight of dale, him and wightaf). Warrior of Dale really disappointed me because a lot of others Dale character can both attack and quest. The ranged don't seem that important because we are the deck who quest anyway.

## 131 [dalestephenson on June 12, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/264977-the-wilds-of-rhovanion-this-is-the-new-big-announcement/?do=findComment&comment=3371149)

We clearly need another weapon for Warrior of Dale, but as it stands now 2-cards and 3 resources for 3 ranged attack + 1 direct damage doesn't seem bad.  He really doesn't need to be *in* the Dale deck unless you're using King of Dale for cost reduction -- in a complementary deck to Brand he can still trigger the card draw and he doesn't need the wp boost.

Raiment of war is going to be very good for both warrior and sentry. 4 attack ranged in that case would be pretty valuable. He’s not great necessarily but I think he will do some work!

Anyone got their hands on the insert rules for this one and can tell us how to create those different encounter card decks (Evil Creatures deck, Caves deck)? It seems we are to use some of the Core Set cards. ?
