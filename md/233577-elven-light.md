Can you play Elven light from your diacrd pile even if your deck is empty? I did it before, but I'M not sure if I could.  :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

Elven-Light: Action: Return Elven-light to your hand from your discard pile. Then, draw 1 card.

 

Sure, no trouble. Your 'deck' is still there, even if empty. Obviously, the draw part fails, but the part where you return Elven-light to your hand is written as an effect, not a cost - which removes any questions of whether you can trigger something that has no effect, and just leaves us with the standard "do as much as you can".

 

Of course without the draw if doesn't actually do much, but I guess it does get you an extra card in hand that you could then use for a discard cost or such.

 

PS this card uses the "then" keyword, which requires the first part succeed before we are allowed to do the second part. But it in no way requires the second part to be doable, so you just do the first part and stop there.

Thanks. That's kind of what I fogured out, but you explain it much better, thanks for the heads up!

I used Elven Light to boost Protector of Lorien.
