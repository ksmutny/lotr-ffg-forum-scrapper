At the moment we have 9 different Dunedain characters available.  The current allies seem to have a vague emphasis on location control or putting progress on locations which is not shared by the heroes we have or know about.  It is not cohesive at all at the moment.

 

So what do you think we will see as the Dunedain theme?

I think that there will be more of the same with a focus on both location and engagement favored abilities.

Well, except for Idraen - she combines perfectly with location-controlling oriented allies.

Next cycle, sure will be released a lot of them.

I see them mainly as a support for other traits. Could be something like cost reduction for a certain group of attachments. Other than that I hope for lots of events, threat lowering abilities and so - hopefully - more secrecy.

Dúnedain sound fun and quite unique. 

 

With the news article using words like a "numerous allies" and "wealth of player cards" I expect them to become a playable trait, much like Silvan has become, by the end of the cycle.

That goes against what we've seen so far.
