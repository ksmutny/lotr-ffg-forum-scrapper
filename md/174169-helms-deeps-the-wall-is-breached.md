Ok this could very well be me being silly however this quest card confuse's me, how would you get past it.

I've just bought the treason of saruman and was reading through the quest cards and quest 4b is where I'm stuck.

It says

8

Forced: after a character is destroyed, place 1 progress on this stage (bypassing any active location)

Now I kinda get that part however it's the next bit that's confusing when it says

If this stage is defeated the players lose the game. Now for me I need to defeat this stage to go into quest card 5a

Probably me being silly and not reading it correctly :-)

The quest also has a keyword, "Defense." This keyword is explained in the rule insert you got for the expansion. It explains that, essentially, the players are not questing. Instead, the encounter deck is attempting to quest against the players. Progress is made by the encounter deck when the threat level is higher than the will power of characters committed to the quest (instead of raising threat level like normal).

You advance to stage five by getting 8 resources on the defense of Helm's Deep card. Just have to read the rules.

Cheers I had a.little skim read of them before bed but couldn't find anything regarding defence as I thought that keyword would have something to do with it. Typical man not reading instructions :-P

Thanks for pointing me in the right direction matey

Hmm.  Still confused on this one.  If the enemy is questing against you and they place 8 progress tokens on this quest, the stage is "defeated" and the players lose the game according to the card text.

To get to stage 5, you need to get 8 resource tokens on The Defense of Helm's Deep objective card.  You place one token on that card at the end of each quest phase.  Once you get to 8, you immediately proceed to stage 5.  It's a survival scenario.

Ahh.  Bingo, that's the part I hadn't put together.
