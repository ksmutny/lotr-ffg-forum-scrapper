What is your opinion on multiple versions of characters?  So far we only have a few: Gandalf, Aragorn, Glorfindel, Bilbo, and Boromir. 

Gandalf, Aragorn and Bilbo are of course "main characters" in the lore.  Boromir, despite his relative prominance in the film, only really has more than a passing mention in four chapters of the book: The Council of Elrond, The Ring Goes South, The Great River, and The Breaking of the Fellowship.  Glorfindel is only on a couple of pages, at least in LotR's proper (I know he features in other sources).  And yet, I think it's great that FFG's has printed multiple copies of these characters, and I'd love for them to make more, as the ones out so far haven't captured every facet of the characters.  Tactics and Leadership fit Boromir best (by far), but could there be a Lore version, representing him at the Council of Elrond when he shares a lot of information?  A Tactics and Spirit Aragorn make sense, and I don't think there is anything wrong with them making another Leadership and Lore one.  I'd also like to see Ally versions of some of the heroes, and certainly heroes of allies, especially Gandalf (my favorite character).  They already did it with Beorn.  I wonder how they could balance a Gandalf hero, however, as his ally version is so strong.  Perhaps they will give us Gandalf the White as a hero and keep Gandalf the Grey as an ally?

How many versions of a character would be too many?  Assuming the game keeps being made for several more years.

I'm a fan of multiple versions.

this is something that is often discussed- for and against. personally im for anything that keeps the life of this game long. more versions=more cards.

also as you say theres different ways to portray characters. im most looking forward to seeing merry and pippin as shirelings and warriors

I want a non-Ally version of Faramir!

Somewhat of an injustice given how many characters Tolkien created throughout the his books, but I would agree, as long as it keeps the game going.

I would just like to see them fill out the roster of prominent characters before they start doing a lot of remakes or else the remakes of the important characters will seem stale.  Still waiting for hero or possibly ally versions of:

Merry 

Sam

Theodan

Eomer

Galadriel

Tom Bombadil (arguable)

Faramir (hero version)

Balin

Oin

Bard

>although the bottom three will likely all come in the next hobbit box

i still want to see a hero version of Haldir too

Other possibilities for heroes we haven't seen yet:

Thranduil (although this brings up those weird situtaions where a hero can be going on a quest for himself)

Celeborn

Gwaihir (we had Beorn in bear form, so why not an eagle?)

 

Overall, I'm pretty happy so far with the mix of redoing old characters with slowly introducing the new ones. If we got them all at once, there wouldn't be anything left to wait for.

The weird reposting of the unique rules in HoN implies that there will be heroes and allies with the same name.

That's for sure. Infact, we already have.

Beorn.

Oh yeah, I didn't get OHaUH, seems like a not real part of the game. Seems like the cards are not really balanced for the rest of the stuff, maybe I only looked at the good cards, though. Thoughts?

      I believe that ff began too early adding new versions of characters in the game , I mean , come on you have so many characters to add on from middle earths mythology guys
