Is the rule that you can max out on three cards of the same name or three copies of one card? I.e. can I play with six faramirs (3 lore and 3 leadership) and six Gandalfs (3 core and 3 OtHUtH) or can I only mix and match to a total of 3?

It's by title, so only 3 total cards titled "Faramir," regardless of which sphere they are in.
