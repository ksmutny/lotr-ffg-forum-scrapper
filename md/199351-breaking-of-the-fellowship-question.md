So shortly: I complete stage 3 and then continue to stage 4. What happens to my friend then? Will he advance to stage 4 too or does he stay at stage 3 still?

I hope that my question isn't unclear.

Having found Frodo's Choice, you advance to stage 4. Your friend remains at whichever stage 3 he was at.

Thanks. That's pretty good quest but that last stage...it's so hard when you reveal 3 cards per round...(i mean in 2-player game)

That's why the other players need to choose the quest stages that let you discard locations and enemies!
