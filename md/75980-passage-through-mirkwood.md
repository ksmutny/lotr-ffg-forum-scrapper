Hi All,

Is it possible to complete this quest in less than 3 rounds?

If so, can anyone give me some tips on how to do this.

Thanks,

Lee

It's theoreticaly possible in 1.

Quest for enough to clear the first stage

Use Legolas & Hand on the Bow (7 buffs) to kill a Spider for 2 on the 2nd stage.

Kill Ungoliants Spawn in combat (assuming stage 3 comes out right.).

Thats going to take 2+ players & a good draw & friendly envounter deck - which will always be the case to blitz it.

Thanks!

Yeah, sounds like you need an optimal card draw to make that work. Especially when you get to stage 3A….

The only time i have completed a quest in 3 rounds is The Dead Marshes. It took me 2 full turns and won in the 3rd. For PTM i think you would have to complete 1 stage in every turn to win it in 3 turns.

I completed Flight from Moria within 1 round, thanks to Boromir.
