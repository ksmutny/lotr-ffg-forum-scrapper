Can you have more then 1 mount? Or is it up to 2 mounts because there restricted?

There is no limit to the number of mounts.  Some are restricted and you can only have 2 restricted items.  But there are many mounts that aren't restricted.

It is theoretically possible in the current card pool to have a hero with 10 mounts attached simultaneously. You shouldn't actually do this as several of them would be completely redundant, but it's possible.
