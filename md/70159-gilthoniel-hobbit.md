forgive me if this has been addressed, but there has been so much talk about the trolls its hard trying to track answers down

so can elebereth gilthoniel be used to throw the trolls from the hobbit back into the deck…effectively making them out of play…do this 3 times and you win right?

i know its not very inspiring play- im just curious as i would have thought some text would have prevented this

thanks

 I think you just broke the quest…. (not really)

It's just an elven Forest Snare in some ways.
