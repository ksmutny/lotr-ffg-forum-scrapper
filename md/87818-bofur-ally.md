With this card what happens if the Questing is not successful?

 

Does the card remain in play or go to discard? Seems a very cheap way of getting an ally into play if he stays there.

 

Thanks

Philip

You get lucky (sort of) and he stays in play. Very good way of getting him with only 1 resource.

Ah yes, BUT, if you have Legacy of Durin in play, then every time you play Bofur in this manner, you get a card.  Quest successfully, and put him back in your hand and play him every turn like that to get an extra card every turn.  =)

I don't think Legacy of Durin does work in this case, since it triggers from playing a card from your hand, not putting a card into play from your hand, which is what Bofur's ability does. It's one of those tricky distinctions that really matter in LOTR. :/

agree with monkeyrama -- "play" vs "put into play" are different actions, so Bofur wouldn't work with Legacy of Durin via his effect.
