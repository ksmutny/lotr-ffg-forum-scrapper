For cards that have effects that occur when another card leaves play, like Horn of Gondor, is that considered only for cards in your play area, or any play area on the table in a team game? IE if one of my friend's characters get killed, do I still get the resource?

It's anywhere. Â They could easily have said "after one of your characters leaves play, do X", but this is a global effect.
