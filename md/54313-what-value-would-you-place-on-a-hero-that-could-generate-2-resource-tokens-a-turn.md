Making a hero that can generate resources seems like an obvious design choice, and I'm sure we will see one soon.

The 15 heroes we have so far have an rough average of:

9 Threat Cost

2 Will Power

2 Attack

2 Defense

4 Health

What kind of stats would you sacrifice to get a hero that says "[This hero] generates one additional resource."

 

I think I would take an 11 Threat, 1 WP, 1 A, 1 D, 3 H.

Add text that says "Exhaust this hero to search your deck for one Song attachment" and I would add three threat.

I would love to see more cards in general for resource generation. We've got quite a few ways of getting the cards we need from the deck... but we don't have a much (anything?) in the way of increasing resources.

I think a hero specifically built for resource generation would be kinda cool.

We have 1 hero already who generate 2 resources per turn. This is Theodred.

Not necessarily.  Sure, when he quests he can generate an additional resource, but what they're talking about is an "unconditional" extra resource each turn.

I was hoping for something like a spirit hero that you could exhaust to get a -2 cost discount on your next spirit event card you play that turn.  It doesn't give you money, but it helps you play cards.

Yeah, I like the "exhaust to lower the cost of the next [ally/event] by 2" idea.

If u want hero that generates 2 resources per turn unconditionally then he must have worse stats compared to Theodred who does it conditionally.

I think we'll sooner see a Tactic hero who generates resources when an enamy is killed or a Spirit gero who gets cash when location is explored etc.

 I would definitely give him low stats and OVER 10 threat points...

I'd rather see it as cards in the deck that can put resources on heroes rather than it be Hero abilities.

Gloin + Self-preservation = potential 2 extra resources per turn.

(obviously, it'd be an even better combination with Citadel plate, song of wisdom and a burning brand all added to him, but that's starting to get ridiculous with card draw.)

I think, that for the time being, this is one of the ways in which the designers have chosen to restrict/balance player decks. If we had as many resource generating cards as we do draw cards, Sauron and his minions would be running back to Mordor, never to come out again. 

As for a hero that could generate two resources a turn, I think his threat should be the highest in the game yet. Think about it, you cannot evaluate him on what he can do alone, you must also consider what kind of synergies he would create and what advantages that would generate. 

Considering that we already have multiple ways of adding card draws and a powerful resource generating attachment like Steward of Gondor, what do you think such a hero is worth, even with low stats? You could very quickly be playing multiple allies or attachments which would take the load off of him and then he would go right on generating resources. I think a hero like this could represent a significant level of power creep in the game because of all he could be surrounded with and may have to be treated accordingly.

The cost will probably have to be somewhere between a hero (produces 1 resource) and a hero with Steward of Gondor attachment (produces 3 resources).  But a hero producing 2 resources might be too powerful.

Instead of making a Hero produce 2 resource tokens by itself, why not make an attachement such as "The Ring" that would produce and extra resource every turn to the hero that has it, but also adds 2 threat each turn.

Or you could have Allies such as "Sam" that when it play they add a resource to a hero or create resource themself since they are such an add to the party. gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]

Or maybe a hero that allows you to produce extra resources at the cost of 1 threat per resource token... We've already got Frodo turning damage into threat, so this seems like an interesting option.

 or even the opposite - for e.g. Sam - pay 2 resources, lower 1 threat! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]) (limit once per round) :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

I agree this a lot! It would most propably be so big power creep, that It would make most old scenarios obsolete in one night... I don't wanna see that to happen! Conditional resource pool adding may be ok, if there is shadow counterpart, but even that would make a guite havok among older quests.

This is actually a reasonable idea. By balancing positive effect with negative effect does not cause so bad power creep as many other "dream" cards above. The problem is balancing. How to make it reasonable usefull without making card useless by too steep negative effect.

Generating two resource tokens each turn would immedialy some of the angst from having Caught In The Web attached to one of the heroes!
