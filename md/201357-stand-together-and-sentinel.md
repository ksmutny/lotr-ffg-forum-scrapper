Remember Stand Together, the Core Set coaster? It reads, "Action: Choose a player. That player may declare any number of his eligible characters as defenders against each enemy attacking him this phase." (Emphasis mine.)

 

I once put together a cheesy deck that combined Stand Together with Beregond, Gondorian Spearmen, and Spears of the Citadel; it was ace at direct damaging enemies to death before their attacks could even resolve. But reading the recent FAQ update reminded me...

 

FAQ 1.52: " 'The defending player' - When an enemy makes an attack against a player, or a character controlled by a player, that player is 'the defending player' regardless of whose character is declared as a defender. Card effects, including shadow card effects, that target 'the defending player' or 'you' still target the player who the enemy is attacking even if another player declares one of his characters as a defender for that attack."
 
So, if an enemy engaged with some other player is being Sentinel defended by Beregond et al., said enemy is not attacking the Beregond et al. player, right? So Stand Together doesn't apply to such a defense?

Seems like you've answered your own question.  I agree that you couldn't use it with sentinel.

I'd almost think you could include your sentinel character with the player you chose for Stand Together.

Stand Together card text says that the chosen player can use any of "his" characters as defenders, which means you would either need to choose yourself and use Sentinel defenders (assuming the enemy is attacking someone else) or choose the player being attacked and they can use any of their characters.

Since this is a core set card, I think it would be clarified as "that player may choose any number of characters he controls as..." If it were printed recently or in the future.

Hmmmmm... I'll have to read the rules carefully for Sentinel again, but another player's Sentinel character isn't one of yours for the purposes of Stand Together, or anything else, no?

Action: Choose a player. That player may declare any number of his eligible characters as defenders against each enemy attacking him this phase."

 

Yea, it allows that player to declare a bunch of defenders, but it clearly doesn't extend that to others, so not sure there is an opportunity to declare a sentinel character in the defense along with any other characters that player wishes to use.

Correct.
