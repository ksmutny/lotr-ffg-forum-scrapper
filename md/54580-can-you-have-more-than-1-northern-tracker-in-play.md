Sorry if this is a total noob question, but I was wondering if I have 2 or three northern trackers in play can I use them all to completely remove unexplored locations from the game?

 

Thanks

Yes, they are not unique thankfully.

 Thank you!!

I thought maybe when I was clearing out the threat level of locations left and right I was doing something wrong.

Thats the point of them. Some folks will complain that they are too good but I think they are needed to balance the game, especially on location heavy quests.

They are also cost of 4, which in the scheme of things is very high. If you have three Spirit heroes and no boost to your resources this means 4 turns to play all three of them and nothing else.

 Exactly Puzzle...I don't usually play this guy (though I admit, he is very good at handling locations in the staging area).

 Just as an anecdote, today I was Playing the Hills of Emyn Muil for the first time today and I was excited to get a Northern Tracker in my opening hand, since I knew this was a very location-heavy quest.

His ability only got used once, and that was then undone by a treachery card. I got both of my Northern Trackers out, but I was managing my Quest phase so efficiently that they ended up just hanging back and helping kill the occasional monster.

(This was a solo game with a pure Spirit deck and it owned the quest.)
