May is too optimistic. Dunland trap is still at the printer, and next week is the end of April.

Boat ride is 6 weeks minimum. So my best bet is June.

According to amazon.de Dunland Trap is going to be released next week:

This slow lag between releases saps momentum in this game.

 

I liked VOI, but  I have not played any of the scenarios in a month, they just did not have the replayability I was hoping for, and After beating all of the scenarios in a week with a few different types of decks.  It felt like a waste of time to keep at it since the challenge was not that great.  Even the player cards did not expand my deck building to much.  Doomed decks became a sort of a dead end strategy pretty quickly, and I could only really make one type of Rohan deck that worked  that I really liked.

 

Even playing the old scenarios has not been that intriguing, since even they do not provide much challenge anymore.

 

I am happy Nightmare packs are starting to fill this void while waiting between the Cycle and/or AP's, while also adding more challenge to familiar scenarios.

 

As much as I enjoy spoilers, I'm a little tired of seeing content that will not make it into my hands for six months.  At the rate they are going we will have all the APs spoiled before we have the first pack in our hand.  

 

The worst part then is now we'll see all the possible connections  between spoiled player cards and then have to wait another 6+ months before we can build decks with all of the cycles cards.  Annoying!

 

I'd be find if they did all the cycles spoilers before the first AP if we were able to purchase all the player cards for the cycle straight away, and then each month we get a new adventure to try our decks out on.  That would be great.

 

Since that is not likely to happen. I'd rather they just keep spoiler articles to within a month or two before we see the AP, that makes it more exciting knowing that I will be able to try out some new player cards on a new quest very soon.

 

Maybe this all does not matter much to the developers, but it is something they should be aware of, since I think it does take a toll on player moral and interest in the game.  They should seriously take a look at how to handle spoiled material in relationship to when products will be available.  I'm sure this is something they already do quite a bit, but my thought is that it is just not working out. 

 

It is a double edge sword, since many players cry for spoilers  and are excited to get them, but then we also cry when we have to wait months before we see the product in our hand.

Very true, rough talking about how much I'm looking forward to play wing foot knowing in the back of my mind it probably won't be in my hands until August or September.

Tell you what though, that long stretch between Morgal Vale and VoI was really rough. With only 1 quest and a small number of player cards to boot

This is my first card game so I have no expectation about the speed of releases.  Are fast releases a recent trend?  10 years ago could you expect a monthly release of cards from, say, Magic?  I've been into PC gaming much longer, and in that arena you wait years between releases.  The advent of microtransactions and DLC has sped that up, but still, major releases are typically one or more years between.

Magic basically has four releases per year and they are like clockwork. The cards are well tested and the language is precise. But it is the biggest ccg, they have a huge budget and they've twenty years of experience.

Stop being impatient! Wasn't there a long wait in between stewards fear and heirs as well?

There is plenty of POD content as well and the new nightmare packs are

Out. Play those instead.

This is a really fine balance for them to manage - they can only afford to release a certain amount of content a year. (and It is picking up really). We now get sagas, deluxe expansions, cycles and POD (nightmare and one unique hard quest a year).

When the game first started it took 18 months or something to get the first cycle completed - and none of the other content came out. Long stretches of no news took it's toll previously so we now get regular updates - however at some points in the year those updates have to reveal content we won't get for a while. 

I think this game is harder to manage than the other LCG's because it's not really multiplayer (you can play with people - but you don't play against them). Most of the life of the other games comes from new opponents, but there's a lot less variability in the deck building and once you've beaten the quests...

That said I don't get to play that often so really, I'm lagging behind on quest completion. I haven't touched VoL yet. Maybe If I'd played it all and built all the decks I wanted I'd be irritated by the previews.

The problem with this game is replay value.

When it's a competitive game people can use the same card pool for years playing against friends.

When it's co-op you play against a encounter set. Once you can smash it (with the design of quests like encounter at amon din for instance) this can take 2-3 play through and you are done.

Even experts on the PODCASTS and LCG progression series have stated that they don't play some quests more than once bc they suck, are too easy, or they have some trick you have figured out.

You lack that ability to just match wits against a buddy, so replay value suffers. It's like a game Halo aganist the computer and then missing the xbox oine experience.

According to one site, 38 more days 'till Dunland Trap is released...

I love the quests from VoI and I replay them very often with different decks.

These three points I would like to support, though I was overall quite happy with VoI, though only the first quest is the one I am coming back to now, it is not terribly difficult but interesting enough. I also do not mind winning a majority of the games just as long as they are no walk in the park.

 

Now to the points, the marketing of this game is poor. We so often get previews of a pack long in advance and then nothing prior to the release. It is like having a trailer to a movie six month before, and then none in the last six weeks before the premiere.

 

Doomed decks suck for me. I hardly expected that. I still like Deep Knowledge but outside of that, these do not seem nearly as powerful, or fun, as I anticipated.

 

And yes, teasing us with new deck archetypes, like the wonderful-looking Silvan decks, and then having us wait half a year for them, that is cruelty.

No. The game was released in April 2011 and the Shadow of Mirkwood cycle ended before the end of the year, with Khazad-dum not that far away. And that did include a delay between the core and the first adventure pack.

Then add a few months for me to get it in Australia. How wonderful... Not.

I am just starting to grab the nightmare decks so I am sort of lucky. But I need some more player cards and heroes

I was thinking that too. Stewards Fear was out mid-May in the UK, if I remember, so I'm guessing it'll be the same this time.

 

At least they've just released the next three NM mode decks  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
