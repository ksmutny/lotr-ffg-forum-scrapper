What is the meaning of the gold ringed icons on some of the encounter deck cards. Like exhaustion from journey to rhosgobel

If you play the game on 'easy mode,' you remove all of those gold-ringed cards from the encounter deck, and play the game without them.  You also start  the game with 1 resource on each of your heroes (so after the Resource phase, each of your heroes will have 2 resources on them).

Play easy mode?  Then I might win... Where's the fun it that.

Even on easy mode, some quests are pretty difficult... Escape from Dolg Guldur comes to my mind...

Yeah, well Escape from Dol Guldur is always hard because if your deck has any synergy, you can randomly lose by losing a hero important to your strategy.

... and sometime it is just because in solo you face 4 encounter cards on turn one with only 2 hero and, at the best, one ally.
