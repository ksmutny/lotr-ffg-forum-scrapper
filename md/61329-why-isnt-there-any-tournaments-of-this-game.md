 Since the game does have support to scoring points and so ranking players, althoug it's still a cooperative game. Solo games or even group games could be ranked by the scores, and so making a tournament viable. Still, this is the only LCG from FFG that doesn't have support to or an organized tournament. Any good reason for that?

it is still in its infancy- we are only in the beginning of the 2nd cycle of cards and the rules are still being 'refined' as it were

despite having no personal interest in it, i none the less see no immediate tournament scene for at least a few more cycles, if it ever happens at all

there is never going to be a torny system for this game.. give it up.. FFG will try and force one on it.. but the game is still miles and miles form being able.. The rules are not even defined yet... you can not have a torny system with out definite rules.. a perfect example is the table talk rule... this is so badly worded and meaningless at the moment.. it needs to be shored up.. also there is the problem of cheating and miss plays.. unlike a pvp game were each player checks each other.. this is not happening.. so at a event every single table needs a judge to watch it.. this will be expensive and slow...

All in all we are a lot closer.. but there is still SOOO much work that needs to be done at the FFG level b4 a torny system can even be started..

Agreed, tournaments will not take place for this game. The need to have a judge at every single table to prevent cheating alone makes tournaments impossible to operate. Also, if there would be tournaments, we would have seen them by now. Why wait so long until the game isn't new and fresh anymore and people lose interest?
Here in the forum, there are a few "tournaments" where people compare their scores with each other, sometimes with restrictions regarding deck-building. This is the closest we will get to tournaments.

The problem of judge is really easy to solve.As was declare before the tournaments system is develop for the team (2 player each) against other team.

So players come to tournament declare  them self as a team(declare the deck lists) and every round get other team opponent them. First team play other team look and judge and then they change the role. So 1 round 2 game first team and second team 1 game. Best scores win then procedure to next round where wining teams play to against each other and lose teams do same. There should be some additional rules to make tournament game more harder or some special tournament pack for the final game. The team who get  best scores win tournament and then have the final game against some special quest.

The idea play as a team against other team is brilliant in my opinion! I really hope the tournament system will come and that was designers promise from the beginning.
