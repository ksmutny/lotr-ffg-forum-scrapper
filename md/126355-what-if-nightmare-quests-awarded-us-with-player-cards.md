Uh, just a thought. What if each nightmare quest were supplied with 3 copies of a player card that you *thematically* aquire after beating this quest?

 

Just a couple of my thoughts...

This is an awesome idea. I always thought Nightmare should've peppered in like 1-2 player cards that were only usable during Nightmare or something of that nature, but acquiring them as you play would work too.

If a player card would be present in the Nightmare pack I would buy it immediately. Now, I really have to think about it, thus I have not bought any yet. Some quests are hard enough anyway.

Or they could include some promos like full-art heroes. That would be awesome too.

Yes idea is not bad.. But why we just cannot get some POD players cards? That can be awesome

Actually, POD player cards would be not-that-awesome because of the different manufacturing quality. But a stand-alone expansions with exlusively player cards - would be totally nuts.

I agree about the difference, but I also think that most of us would still buy and use them in a heartbeat. 

 

Now, if they implemented some sort of "boon" you attach at set-up or a hero, then there would be no issue.

For sleeve users that would cause no problem, yes, but I for one don't sleeve my cards. Mostly because sleeving my entire collection now would cost more than a deluxe box expansions, I don't have that kind of luxury at the moment. And when I play nightmare, for example, I always know what next card is going to be - nightmare or regular. Same goes with shadows.

Why not apply this to the regular quests instead? (Have some of the cards thematically tied to defeating the adventure) then the cards would be of standard quality instead of POD quality.

Assuming you're idea is to get that thematic tie, rather than just more player cards?

Nope, it was to get more player cards :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

 

Nightmare packs come without player cards, that's why throwing in 3 copies of one with each sounds tempting :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

Dol Guldur refugee is from the film (or book) '300'?

Dunno. Picture was called "Orc prisoners".

How about this: Convince the team that it's worth it for them to print a ton of a new player card via their regular source, then include 3 in a certain Nightmare pack and see how it sells? My guess: like hot cakes (American idiom for really fast).

Good luck convincing FFG  :lol: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_laugh.png]

We might be able to convince FFG to do a player card only expansion if the game continues to grow.

This kind of stuff requires strong online community. LotR LCG has an extremely weak and passive online community.

I dont think they'll ever put player cards in a POD expansion. POD is for sets that they know wont appeal to everyone because the POD printers don't have as high of a capacity. The moment they add player cards, everyone will want them and they won't be POD. I'm just fine with things the way they are.

Yes I believe you right.
