# [Ghan-Buri-Ghan X value with Immune active location](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/231733-ghan-buri-ghan-x-value-with-immune-active-location/)

I assume Ghan-Buri-Ghan's X willpower value is the threat of the active location, even if the active location is "Immune to player card effects", correct? You're not affecting the location, but are only reading a value from it, so I assume this is legit.

 

I'm playing "Journey to the Cross-roads" where the final active location ("The Cross-roads") has 9 threat and is immune, and I believe Ghan-Buri-Ghan will take it out.

That would be correct. Ghan-Buri-Ghan's passive ability does not target nor does it affect the card.

 

His Travel Action would not be something you could use since it can affect the card.

 

(1.47) “Immune to player card effects”, expanded

Cards with the text “Immune to player card effects”
ignore the effects of all player cards. This means
that player card effects cannot directly influence or
interact with a card that is immune to player card
effects.

Cool, and I finally beat Journey to Cross-roads without any enemies escaping.  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

May I ask what heroes you used?

I play 2 handed. Deck 1 had Faramir (leadership), Gimli, and Mablung. Deck 2 had Damrod, Haldir, and Pippin (lore). For Frodo Fellowship hero, I used the one where spending 1 of his resources gives him +2 WP and +2 Attack.

 

It took a lot of deck tweaking, but next time I won't be so determined -- I just made it a personal challenge this first time around to have no enemies escape as I found the quest really fun and creative.
