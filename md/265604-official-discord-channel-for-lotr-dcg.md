Below is a response I gave in a brief discussion (discord cotr lotr-dcg) over the desire for an official discord channel with the digital game. It's based, as well, on Luke questioning if their was interest for a discord channel in the first twitch stream. I made a post on the steam forum afterwards and was disappointed to see no real feedback there. I know interest may pick up after early access actually kicks off and people get into the game, but I'm hoping they (FFI) might get something going beforehand and figured it wouldn't hurt to post here to see about more support for it.

(from cotr lotr-dcg) 

"I’ve playtested for a company (finishing up early access with their main title) where they settled on a Trello & Discord combo for official community involvement and interaction. Nothing’s perfect but with help from responsible volunteer fans to moderate, it’s been really great. Best early access model I’ve seen in the way it can bring a wide spectrum of fans together with devs, organize voip testing and play sessions, plus keep everyone informed and excited with development progress more expeditiously.
 
I know it’s still really early in early access but the potential community seems so fragmented atm. The sooner they could get something like that going officially, the better it will be for them building off of it imo"
