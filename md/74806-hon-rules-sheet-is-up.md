 Thanks.

The new rules on unique cards are interesting.

They make it even more certain we will see Faramir as a hero.

They are also evidence of the designers thinking carefully about a minor but niggling rules problem in advance - this is encouraging.

Didn´t we have these rule since the base game rulebook?!

Yes but the phrasing is very specifically aimed at Heroes and Allies sharing the same title so it does indeed seem to point towards a Faramir Hero.

I don't know…We already have Beorn as a Hero and an Ally. To be honest I don't see the difference between the rulings. I have always played it where Unique means unique. So only 1 copy could be in play at any give time.

Sure - I agree that it is pretty obvious how this issue should work.

My point was: I am much happier to see FFG being very cautious in clarifying potential rules issues, even if it isn't really necessary. Compared to the cavalier disregard of very obvious rules problems they have previously shown (Foundations of Stone being the worst example in my view).
