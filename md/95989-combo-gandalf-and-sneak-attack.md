Can you play Sneak Attack and put Gandalf in play and benefit from his response and then in the end of phase put him back in your hand?

Thanks

Just bought the startset and love it.

Play on my own when my wife has fallen asleep.

What do you recommend when playing it as a solo game.

Playing with one deck or playing two decks (but I play both)

So far I have played 4 times, one with every sphere and lost 2 and won 2

I pretty much only play with one deck for solo, but many players like 2 decks, especially when the card pool has grown and there are lots of cards that work well with 2 decks, and you get to use ranged and sentinel, you get to use more cards and set up more combos. It's a little more to keep track of, but I prefer the easy set up of one deck.

It's a great solo game. And 2 victories out of 4 is great. Before jumping into 2 deck play, I would recommend building a duel sphere deck, and even a tri sphere. Lot's of new decisions to make and test out new strategies.
