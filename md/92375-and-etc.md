if a card has 'after you do X, do Y and Z.'

 

....if you can only do Z, say in the case of ever my heart rises it is reduce threat by 1, but cannot do y- here it is readying a hero (if they are already ready) i assume you can still reduce your threat?

 

another example is of sam gamgee's ability- if he is ready does he still get the +1s?

hopefully that all made sense.

thanks

I think so, as long as the Y and Z are not connected with "then", there is no dependency on the successful execution of Y before Z can be executed.
