There is like some 'collections' of class of cards that is one per sphere:

 

- The cards that only can be played by monosphere: lore is 'Advance Warning', leadership is 'Strengh of Arms', spirit is 'Against the Shadow', tactics is 'Trained for war', even neutral 'The White Tower Watchman'.

- About the attachments that return an sphere event: Tome of Atanator (leader), Scroll of Isildur (lore), Map of Earnil (spirit) and Book of Eldacar (tactics).

 

...following this system: the cards with 'Limit one per deck' also there is one per sphere: Path of Need (leadership), The Fall of Gil-Galad (spirit), Black Arrow (tactics).... and!!!: ^^ what would you like for lore???

 

This thread is open to bring ideas for this unknown card, but by other side it seems is coming soon or later.

 

Which card do you think could be the 'Limit one per deck' lore one?

My first idea:

The Wisdom of Istaris

Cost 2.

Response: after you draw a X number of cards, discard The Wisdom of Istaris to chose a player. That player draws the same number of cards.

THe thing about all these limit 1 per deck cards is that they are not usable right off the bat. You need special conditions for them, so I'll expect something like this from lore one too.

something centered around healing or card draw i guess, though i would like to see a card similar to that which removes threat from the encounter deck like in from the wild (i think thats it haha)

A Place to Rest - cost 1

Attach to the active location. It gains +4 quest point and cannot be the target of other player cards effect.

When active location is explored, each player draw a card and heal all damage on his characters. Return all engaged ennemies to the staging area and skip the combat phase this turn.

Limit: 1 per deck.

Not sure if it needs something more.

Maybe its waaaaaaaaay OP-ed but I'd like a card that targets the quest deck. It's also highly situational, but something like this:

 

-Augury (interpreting the will of the gods by studying the flight of birds)

Cost:0

Attachment

 

Attach to a lore hero.

Quest resolution action: When progressing to the next stage of the quest, if the next quest step has more cards of equal numerical value the first player chooses which card resolves.
For the rest of the game, player cannot reduce their threat values.

Limit:1 per deck

 

Sorry for my horrible wording. At any rate a card that could let the players choose whether they want to encounted shelob's spawn or try to avoid it in PtM, or something like that.
