First of all I like this quest.  Its tough but doable (think the Dol Guldur is the hardest but then again Dol Guldur one of the one evil places in Middle Earth) however my friend and I have beaten it and we never get the ally in time because we usually beat before.  And you have to dump alot of resources on him.  I realize that Song of kings is good here and also the Oaks location (which seems to come up as a shadow card often) to help that.  He seems like he would make the fighting easier.  What do you think?  Is he worth the resources?  Also it seems that not getting a hill troll at Carrock and taking down the trolls brothers one at a time is easier. the miners seems valueable because they can get rid of sacked! Gandalf with Born aloft is awesome too, its really helpful for Troll beatdown the ol Gandalf recycler lol.

I just beat it for the first time! I'm so excited! I did it with the Three Hunters.

I do think Grimbeorn is worth the money, especially if you have Steward of Gondor out. This last game I didn't have steward of Gondor out but I took my time preparing before I moved onto the 2nd stage of the quest and had enough resources to buy Grimbeorn, he was so helpful!

Try Massing in Osgiliath this one is really brutal. More difficult than Dol guldor.

Massing at Osgiliath?  Is that a new quest coming out?

It is a quest FFG produced for Gen Con, although it should shortly be available via their print on demand service.

Lets looks at a few similar allies:

Brok Ironfist (cost of 6): 2 Will, 2 Attack, 1 Defense, 4 Hit Points.  Crappy ability.

Beorn (cost of 6): 1 Will, 3 Attack, 3 Defense, 6 Hit Points.  Ability can be useful, but then he's gone.

Grimbeorn the Old (cost of 8): 2 Will, 4 Attack, 3 Defense, 10 Hit Points.  Awesome ability.

Looking purely at his resource cost, I think that Grimbeorn is absolutely worth it; however, it is important to keep in mind that in my experience, I rarely (never) use allies like Beorn because the fact of the matter is that I never have so many excess resources available to me that I can afford the luxury of playing them.

I think the thing that makes Grimbeorn great, however, is being able to travel to the Wild-Oak location, and then both players can simply contribute four resources apiece (of whatever they have excess of), in order to bring to bear an exceedingly powerful ally designed to provide exactly what the players need to soak up vicious troll attacks.  Too many Lore resources?  Help buy Grimbeorn.  Too many Leadership resources?  Help buy Grimbeorn, etc.

Grimbeorn is by no means necessary to beat CatC, but for certain decks he could be very useful.  Especially considering that people are probably going to start running more (read: any) copies of Lore of Imladris in their decks because of Rhosghobel's impending release, I think we'll probably see more players opting to invest those resources into him (healing 9 hit points on him for 2 resources is pretty sweet).
