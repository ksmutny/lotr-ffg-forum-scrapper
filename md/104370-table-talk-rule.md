Someone suggested a separate post about this rule so here it is.

Do you follow this rule? Are you saying 'ambush Ishtari' instead of sneak attack gandalf.

If you are following the rulebook then the former is allowed and not the later. Moreover this makes playing two handed solo completely illegal and cheating.

Any thoughts on this?

Do whatever you like, it's your game. No competitions or referees out there who will punish you for ignoring this stupid rule.

 

For me, I stick to the rules which makes it impossible for me to play two-handed

IMO this rule was designed to eliminate quarterbacking, so one player asking everyone what they have, then telling them what to do. If that won't be a problem, then I don't view it as cheating or anything, seems silly if you're saying ambush istari.

Exactly. It's always seemed pretty clear to me that it was an attempt to stop one player from dominating things in co-op, rather than something to stop two-handed play or cooperation among players who don't have to worry about one player running everything. With that said, I completely disregard the table talk rule, and think it's silly to call two-handed play cheating or illegal.

If one would call playing two-handed "cheating" or "illegal" - one should first define "legal".

 

The point is, if one would visit some official event from FFG - one would be forbidden from playing alone with two hands, so I guess it's kinda "illegal".

This seems crazy to me. But yeah, your game, no referees I guess.

I don't follow this rule to the letter - I don't ask people what they have in hand or anything like that, but I occasionally you just have to reveal something otherwise players can't work together at all.

 

For instance you can't communicate things like "you don't need to defend any attacks this turn" without essentially revealing what's in your hand (because basically only a  few cards exist that prevent all attacks you can pretty much determine what card is being refereed too).

 

I think the spirit of the rule is - if you play co-op you're meant to be two people playing together, not one person playing two hands.

 

That said if someone wanted to play solo with two hands I wouldn't have any problem with that (Personally I couldn't be bothered with that and would play with others or play one handed solo).

This.

We play by every rule, except the table talk one. We consider it just plain dumb.

It's quite weird, as they also encourage players to talk about the best course of action in the same rule book.

I disagree. While not cheating the spirit of the game is hurt when you can see all the other players cards. That's why table talk partly exists, so for instance you don't know that you, for instance, you should berevor your partners instead of yourself bc his hand is weaker. It takes that whole part out of the game. Think of it like this, you have one team of elves and one ram of dwarves going out on a mission. They likely won't show their entire arensal of weapons to each other even though they have a common goal. Why using two handed solo you have killed this part of the game and taken any guess work out of knowing what your partner might have or need. There are times when you watch te progression series videos and see Mitch draw tons of cards bc he is looking for something even though Matthew may need it more (a part of the game totally lost if he controlled both)

Obviously Ian you know way more about this game then me, but I must say that if FFG intended for this they would have included a description of it in the rules. Instead they clearly describe solo play, not this variant.

This game was never deigned to be played two handed solo - it's something that was made up by people who don't like playing solo and don't have friends to play with.

## 10 [Glaurung on April 20, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/104370-table-talk-rule/?do=findComment&comment=1055819)

I think this rule fix 2 thinks:

1 not allow 1 player to rule the table.

2 dont delay the game with 3 4 players for long discussion about how better combine cards in they hands. Save time and players respect. But in 2 players game in Nmode you should build up the decks together so you should know your partner deck by the heart. anyway is good rule in the first 2 cases.

Wow you really don't have any respect for anyone on these forums do you? First your little tantrum on the Loragorn and desperate alliance thread now this. ALOT of people play this game two-handed, me being included. It is not illegal and it is not cheating.

Its simply two player with one person controlling both decks instead of two people.

Whats more the table talk rule was CLEARLY designed for this reason:

Also your example of a team of elves and dwarves on a mission together is:

a) very handy for your argument, what if it was a team of elves and elves, or men and men, or hobbits and elves. They don't share the animosity that Elves and Dwarves have for each other so I'm sure would work together properly and let the other "team" know exactly what they have up their sleeves and in their scabbards.

b) Is not very thematic to begin with, when are dwarves and elves going to team up for a quest? Unless it is some huge necessity or they have no choice (eg: fellowship, battle of five armies)

Also "killed this part of the game and taken any guess work out of knowing what your partner might have or need". Theres no guess work in Solo so its just like Solo but some people don't want to play Solo with only one deck and only one encounter card revealed per turn. In my opinion I think solo takes away from the game and its mechanics and is a lesser way of playing considering things like surge, doomed etc lose alot of their bite (then again you have less actions and characters so not saying its easier, I just personally don't like this variant). I'm not going to rant on about it though, call it easier, illegal or cheating or offend all Solo Players on here and act like a complete jerk in general.

"This game was never deigned to be played two handed solo - it's something that was made up by people who don't like playing solo and don't have friends to play with." Yeah I don't like playing solo and don't have friends who are interested in this sort of game, this does not mean im cheating or playing illegally, im just playing two player on my own because I dont like to play solo/with one deck. If it is really cheating, illegal and as easy as you seem to think then probably more than half of the people on here aren't playing the same game as you apparently.

 

Bottom line I think you should either not bother participating in these forums and just go away or show alot more respect for the other people who post on here.

Why this "illegality" of playing two-handed alone bothers you so much? As I stated previously, technically playing two-handed alone is illegal because no one'll let you play that way on the official tournament. But, who the fudge cares if you're playing at home or at any other unofficial place?

## 13 [GrandSpleen on April 21, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/104370-table-talk-rule/?do=findComment&comment=1056204)

Adhering to the rules is grand and I do it plenty myself, but it will only prop you up until the winds change.  Caleb has been quoted before acknowledging 2-handed play as a popular, but unsupported, variant.  It will take only a general FAQ release to deflate righteous fury here, so just watch that you aren't too invested in your own arguments regarding propriety and cheating.

Just curious but if doing something that isn´t supported by the rules, which sharing information between players/hands is not, is not considered cheating/illegal, then what is?

Alot of people also log their scores according to the original rules instead of the current rules. It is pretty obvious who they are when you try to compare scores.

Just because alot of people do it, doesn´t mean it is legal/supported.

 

It just means that some people like to play the game with those house rules variants and nobody can tell them otherwise.

However, by that same token, when choosing to play like that, those same people cannot demand (or expect), that the people who do follow the official rules to acknowledge the games played by those same house rules variants.

I did not read further than this ... I will later. After the morron thing i find this also a bit annoying.

To start with I do not play two handed, i play either solo or with my wife. When playing with her we discuss our strategy prior to the game and then trying to keep the rule but not strictly.

BUT , this game is neither tournament, nor abstract or anything, it is firstly a game to have fun with the Tolkien world. What i like in it is the feel you have freedom to play it however you like, not strictly by the book and this doesnot change much in the result. Also it is not always easy for everyone to have fellow players, and as any game this is also better with two or more. So i find normal for people playing two handed and admire their passion , i would never calling them cheaters or anything.

Cool a bit, it is a game, a co op game, not a game you have to win the other.

When i play two-handed games i dont log the score. I think it is because i consider is not 100% official.

And about talking of cards, i dont show my hand but when i player ask for any card i say if i have or not. I do it, for example: a friend is playing spirit, and a bad treachery is revealed; i ask friends for a test of will, lol, even if i know they play it without i ask for it.

I think the objection some people have is to the term "cheat".

 

The term implies a certain amount of moral superiority from the people that use it and of moral inferiority or mistakes from those it is applied too.  For instance, we would have less respect for the person that won the race if they did it by tripping someone else - in fact in a competitive environment we would disallow the cheat from taking part in future and probably re-run the race without them. 

 

A solitary game is a little different. If we take another example; "I cheated at my computer game to get more money, the money let me see the end of the game." Now if you do that in isolation or acknowledge the cheating when you talk to others about the game it probably won't matter. If however your friends haven't beaten the game and you brag about beating it first your friends will probably get annoyed when they discover you cheated.

 

In the case of this card game if many people play two handed - and then playing two handed is functionally different (as 7theye is of the opinion it is) then those people being heavily involved in say, strategy and play discussions without acknowledging the variant they play will interfere with and upset the discussions.

 

Personally I think that playing two handed is not that different from playing two player. You do lack information about the other players hand; but I really don't think this is going to have that much impact. It's pretty rare that the other player will have a card which significantly changes your play.

Some corner cases may exist if you knew they had shadow card cancellation in hand you might spend Balin's resource when you would otherwise keep it. On the other hand if I was in that game I would certainly ask; "Do I need to keep Balin's resource?" And then without revealing what they have in hand the other player would probably say yes or no.

If people play in silence and don't communicate at at all I guess that could be a different play experience, but I don't think that's what most people have in mind when they want to play co-op. Because I don't think two-handed is much different from two player I don't think I would care if people discussed strategies and then I found out they played two-handed later; even though I never would. 

(I never would because of the hassle, not a moral objection).

## 18 [Tracker1 on April 21, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/104370-table-talk-rule/?do=findComment&comment=1056473)

When I play 2 or more player games we don't show each other our hands, and try to limit the amount of direct card referencing as much possible, but we have no problem asking another player if they have a card that will help in a certain situation, but ultimately it will be up to the player with the card to use it or not. On very tough situations we may strategize a bit more, and each player will say I can do this with these cards and such. The most strategizing generally takes place during the encounter and combat phase there is actually very little during the planning phase and players generally never suggest to a player which ally to play etc.

Two handed solo play, which i don't play any more, is really different then playing with another player. I stopped playing it because it seemed to alter the balance of the game and made it easier then playing with another player. Because I had control of both decks, i could plan a strategy that would not likely occur with a second player, unless we were playing completely open hands or the other player played the game exactly like I did.

For example, In 2 handed solo i could build decks and have a hero continually give his resource Bifur in the other deck, and then I could also have Theodred from the other deck always give his resource from questing to Bifur too. Further more, I could have the other deck play SoG on Bifur. Most likely this would not happen in a real 2 player game, unless players sat down and said this is exactly how we are going to play these decks, which is a valid way to play, but there would probably still be some minor differences in player choices, unless every card played was okayed by both players, which would then completely break the table talk rule, but at that point even with a second player, they are pretty much playing a solo 2 handed game. Most players I have played with would not want to loose 2 resources per round and give up SoG, and they also want to have freedom in the chocies they make to enjoy the game. Even if i disagree with a choice, i still need to respect how they are playing the game, or else it's not going to be very much fun.

So, generally I think 2 handed play allows for deck building and game play strategies that are usually not likely to occur in regular 2 player games. I will not say it is cheating since it's a non competitive game and we can play how we like, but I can see why it would be considered illegal and not supported as an official play style by FFG.

## 19 [entMoot on April 21, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/104370-table-talk-rule/?do=findComment&comment=1056517)

In addition to the fact that we are playing a cooperative game, even in competitive CCGs like Magic there are casual variant formats that get played though there are no official rules for them. One format became so popular, that the Wizards of the Coast now officially supports it with product releases (not that this would make sense for 2-handed play in LotR).

 

If you play by the core rules, that's great! I do the same most of the time. But if I happen to try a 2-handed round, it's not hurting anyone, so no need to take offense. Player-created variant formats are not unheard of in card games, and no one can force you to play 2-handed or use the old scoring system just because they prefer it.

## 20 [Distractionbeast on April 21, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/104370-table-talk-rule/?do=findComment&comment=1056548)

I like table talk.  My friend and I are at comparable levels of skill and experience, so no one dominates, but the cross talk makes for more interaction and in my opinion, more fun.  

 

We generally stop short of mentioning specific cards, but heavy handed hints are not unheard of.  Stuff like "Don't worry about that troll.  I can stall him."   It really doesn't matter to us.  The fun of the game comes from our strategizing together, and table talk only enhances this.  Most often, it's announcing a card one of us is playing and then talking through what would be the best target for it.

 

The fun of staying close to the rule though is the occasions for throwing down impressive surprise moves or combos and wowing the other players.

 

It's co-op.  It's your game, your experience.  Play it whichever way makes it fun for you.

## 21 [Raven1015 on April 21, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/104370-table-talk-rule/?do=findComment&comment=1056583)

I tend to play this game in a variety of formats: two-handed solo, one-handed solo, and 2-4 players with others. Each and every one of these formats feels different than the others, which is why I don't like restricting myself to any given one, because they all open up different experiences. That being said, I think good strategy and good deck building translates across all of them, and doesn't change substantially. Think about the common practice of one player building decks for everyone else in a 2-4 player game. Is this cheating? It does allow for more coordination and knowledge than would be possible otherwise, but is not cheating, and is common because it is difficult to plan out decks to work together well unless you're blessed with an abundance of free time. On the other hand, everyone showing up with a random deck is its own fun and its own challenge, but not superior in some moral sense.

 

Personally, I've always maintained that the table talk rule is itself silly and should not have been included in the rulebook. It could've simply been included in a "suggestions" section for players to use if they are worried about one player dominating all the decisions. One reason why is because, according to the letter of the rules, you can say "ambush Istari", or I have "shadow cancellation in hand", or "I have a Spirit ally that can boost defense" and it's perfectly valid. Why go through these contortions? People can argue about the spirit of the rule, but according to the rules themselves, the only thing that is strictly forbidden is reading actual text off a card or naming it. 

 

With that in mind, I follow every rule in the rules to the letter, except the table talk one. As I said, I don't think it should have been included as a rule, as unlike every other rule, it doesn't govern mechanics of the game, but what players can say to each other, which is an extremely odd fit in a cooperative card game. Another cooperative card game, Pathfinder ACG, provides no similar rule, for example. As we all know, the designers made a few odd decisions in the Core Set, simply because this model was so new.

Couldn't ( and didn't) say it better myself. 2 player solo is easier then 2 player bc you can synergize both decks better. That's why it's technically cheating.

You can play chess where a rook can move diagnoally if you want. It's your game just like this is. But two handed solo, as the rules are written, is easier then playing solo or multiplayer and is not an officially reconginized way to play. If your thoughts are that this should be officially supported then it would be nice to have a FAQ for this.

I'm struggling to understand why there is so much scrutiny being placed on this game in particular.

 

Consider the following:

I feel these are functionally different examples.

In your TI example the players are actively discussing house rules - that is, no one is surprised that everyone is talking about rules modifications - because everyone is. (In the same vein I may discuss a house rule to my role-playing game).

You playing a game with the wrong number of players in the star wars example does not invalidate your experiences. However I believe that if you were to take that play experience and then try to suggest, for instance, balance changes where some cards turned out to be rubbish or too good - that other players could legitimately call you out on trying to say your play experience should impact theirs when you're intentionally house ruling.  -

Ultimiately I feel the problem that 7theye and now Tracker1 are highlighting is that fundamentally playing two handed is not the same as the experience that's supported by the game designers and therefore it would be akin to you saying that your solo experience should lead to other players experince being changed (if you asked for errata say). I don't think anyone is claiming that playing a variant is itself a problem, rather playing it and then trying to change the game through discussion and not acknowledging the variant is wrong.

Your Arkham Horror example is completely off topic because the rules specifically allow exactly what you're saying. Arkham Horror also contains no hidden information at all. Therefore a group of players playing it together could discuss everything just like an individual playing 8 (and you must be mad if you do) investigators them-self.

The meta-game element that brings so much scrutiny is that we're on a forum for this game - and so everyone here likes to discuss the game extensively. This leads to people who play variants that are commonly accepted but unsupported potentially asking for strategies or plans which other players think should never be allowed.

In a pick-up game I would not play with someone that had the same hero as me, I would rather play with someone else or play a different deck. Two spirit glorfindels or two Eowyns (or imagine two lore pippins with +6 or 7 to every enemies engagement threat) is just too imbalanced to make the game fun for me.

When you play 2 handed is like playing both sides in chess, not like moving the rook diagonally, this is a really stupid example/argument you made there m8.

That depends, playing chess as both sides is accepted as a good though exercise but 'not' a real game. Tracker1 (who plays a lot and whom I respect as a skilled player) basically seems to be of the opinion that playing two handed is quite similar to this - a good exercise but not a real game.

Personally I've only tried it once and found it too much effort. However some of the things that Tracker1 says wouldn't happen in a real co-op game (I play steward of Gondor on the second player) are things I have done in co-op if I knew the other deck (usually my wife's) needs resources a lot more than mine.

Rapier said mostly everything I needed to. I also would never play with someone that wants to have matching heroes. Redesigning a deck is easy and should not take long anyways unless your playing against a quest deck you have never played against before, but then it would most likely not be a "pick-up" game.

 

Attempting to limit "table talk" in a co-op game is the definition of antithesis. And the issue of "table talk" is not comparable to your example of having matching heroes. "Table talk" is an issue of communication and is not even possible in solo play. Having matching heroes is a repetition issue that FFG manages by placing quantity capacities and you have to pay attention to it even in solo play. These 2 issues are not the same at all.

Two-handed play is fundamentally different than playing both sides in chess as you're talking about cooperative and controlling two "players" with the same goal vs. competitive, when you're essentially playing against yourself. Again, tending to play all types of games from pure solo to 4 player, I would completely disagree that two-handed play is an "exercise, not a real game". It's different, I'll definitely grant that, but people are vastly overestimating how much it makes the game easier. Indeed, against certain scenarios that are tougher for 2 players than 1 player, two-handed solo is much more difficult than pure one-handed solo (and of course, the reverse is true against other quests). In fact, I originally started experimenting with two-handed play when I was able to fly through certain scenarios solo and wanted a greater challenge, and two-handed play was able to grant this. 

 

Finally, to quote the actual table talk rules:

 

Players are permitted and encouraged to talk to one 

another during play, and to work as a team to plan and 
execute the best course of action. Players can discuss 
anything they would like, but they cannot name or read 
out loud directly from cards in their hand, or from cards 
that they have seen but the rest of the players have not.
 
The funny part is that a strict reading of the letter of the rule doesn't even prohibit you from showing your hand to another player. The only things specifically prohibited are: 1) naming a card (verbally) and 2) reading out loud directly from your cards. This means you can allow another player to read it, you just can't read it out loud! Similarly, 2-handed play wouldn't even break this rule technically, since you aren't naming or reading anything out loud, just reading them to yourself.
 
And yes, I know I'm being a bit ridiculous here, but I use it to agree completely with what tacomen said above:
 

Attempting to limit "table talk" in a co-op game is the definition of antithesis. And the issue of "table talk" is not comparable to your example of having matching heroes. "Table talk" is an issue of communication and is not even possible in solo play.

I'm afraid I don't have enough experience of playing two handed to comment on how similar or not it is to other game types. I'm merely going on what others have said. (Notably so far, only Tracker1,7theye and yourself have actually expressed an opinion on whether two handed is fundermentally different or only a bit different). 

My theoretical position is that I agree with you, that playing two handed and playing co-op with another is basically the same. Although I think your reprinting of the table talk rule has made me feel that I'm actually wrong.

For example - in two player, I may go first and use Denethor (hero) to look at the top card of the deck, decide I can't deal with it and move it to the bottom (the rules disallow me from discussing it with the table). 

In two handed, I may know that player 2 can deal with that card and keep it on top of the deck.

This element of the hidden knowledge is the part that is changed the most in my mind (not what players have in hand - but what players may have revealed to themselves about the encounter deck). 

As for your ridiculous assertion about being able to show the cards to other players, it may not actually state this in the rules but I think it clearly is the case that the whole point of hidden knowledge is that it's hidden - some of the basic assumptions about card games (your hand is secret information) must surely come into play here - I don't think you can expect every game to reprint such absolute basics. - Since you yourself claim this is ridiculous I'm sure that you understand where I'm coming from :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

That said I also feel that your statement about "two handed being seen as easier" is probably the fundamental issue here. I suspect if 7theye thought it wasn't "cheating" (easier) this thread

wouldn't have been made. Tracker1 also wouldn't have stopped playing two handed.

You yourself adopted the variant to look for more difficulty (Which seems perfectly legitimate as well providing that it's acknowledged as a variant). I think the accusations of cheating are far too serious for what we're actually talking about - the word is too highly emotive to actually fit the topic, at least for me. Others in this thread may feel differently.

 

I think the goal of the table-talk rule, was to allow players to not be played by each other - it's an attempt to preserve the hidden information aspects of the game even from your own team. I play a lot of co-op games and it's really difficult to balance the hidden information aspects when everyone is on the same side - you need to allow communication or you can't win (or people aren't really working together so its not co-op) but if you have too much then games can be "solved" by the best player.

Edit: To clarify that I know Raven1015 know's his ridiculous argument is absurd and not to make it seem like I took him seriously when he seemed not to be serious :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

I am sure many players will build decks with another player and try to fine tune the synergy between the two decks. Maybe if two players play together for a long time they will get to know each others tendencies and play styles, so that they build really tight decks together and will make many of the same choices in game play, but even then I cannot picture that another player will make the same exact choices as another.

Until recently I actually used to think that many players would make the same choices, but after seeing the results of 2 Duplicate Tournaments where players are given the same encounter deck and player deck arranged in the same order, i have yet to see a game that is 100% the same as another player. There has been about 20 players in each tournament, and each game was different.

Looking at a 2 player game with this lens, there are many choices that each player will make that might slightly vary from another player, and it could, for better or worse, have a big impact on the game. So, when I think about 2 handed solo, A player has complete control over all of those choices and even the structure of both of the decks and knows intimately how the decks can work together. In my opinion the 2 handed solo player has a greater advantage when compared 2 real players.

I absolutely don't think there is anything wrong with playing 2 handed solo, and do not look down upon it at all. I just think it is important to recognize that playing this way allows a player to create a more optimum strategy for winning that is not easy to replicate in a real 2 player game, unless one player is calling all the shots for the another player. Even if they come to what seems to be a mutually agreed upon strategy by working together it might not be what either of them would have figured out if playing alone

Of course the skill of the 2 players can be factored in, but that's a bit more difficult to asses how that will impact game results. For instance, if you had a very good player with an inexperienced player, and there was some table talk and strategizing, but the experienced player did not dominate the game. They might win, but if each player played the same game 2 handed solo, I'd bet that the more experienced player would have the best results out of all 3 games, with the inexperience player having the worst score and the match they played together being right in the middle. Of course that's all just speculation.

Sounds like you should run a two-player duplicate tournament sometime to me :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] 

Maybe even a two player tournament with two players playing together then apart - if enough interest could be found.

Agreed. The whole framing as "cheating" is why the debate is so impassioned, I imagine. If it was framed as, "Is two-handed a variant?", then I doubt there'd be much disagreement. The fundamental assertion that two-handed play is easier has to be broken down into parts:

 

- Two-handed play is easier than solo play with one deck: This depends on the quest. However, the claim that two-handed play is always easier than solo is just false. Again, depends on the quest. The Druadan Forest is a good example of a scenario that I've just absolutely dominated with one deck, but is much more challenging two-handed. Into Ithilien is another example, where I wouldn't say I beat it easily with one deck, but two decks was more challenging personally.

- Two-handed play is easier than an actual 2-player game: This is pretty much what Tracker is saying (not to put words in your mouth, Tracker), and I agree. Having played plenty of both, the level of coordination you get playing two-handed solo can't be matched by even 2 players who work really well together. However, there is extreme variance among 2 player games. When playing with an inexperienced player, I follow table talk pretty much to the letter, because it's too tempting to dominate. When playing with people I play with often, the cooperation is high, and we usually give resources to each other more often than ourselves, as an example.

 

I think the underlying tension was that to call it cheating means that two-handed makes it easier in both cases. In the first case, this is not true, and in the second case, it is. Is it a variant? Sure. Is it cheating? No. There are a variety of reasons why people play two-handed: wanting to see more of the encounter deck and its synergy, wanting to take advantage of ranged/sentinel, wanting to build more specialized decks than are possible in pure solo, etc. My point is not to say that two-handed solo doesn't make the game different, my point is that it doesn't make it different enough that we can invalidate people from participating in discussions because they play two-handed. It's not equivalent to someone playing both sides in Star Wars and giving strategy input. 

 

Anyway, thanks Rapier for engaging in constructive internet discussion. It shouldn't have to be called out specifically, but with so many bad examples out there, thanks for debating in a productive and non-trollish spirit!

## 34 [Tracker1 on April 22, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/104370-table-talk-rule/?do=findComment&comment=1057189)

Just for the record, some matches I played 2 handed seemed easier for reasons I mentioned in terms of control I had over both decks. A scenarios difficulty certainly varies depending the number of players. Generally, When I was playing 2 handed I had easier victories when playing by myself then I did when playing the same scenario with another player even if they were using a deck I created. of course, we might have had a tougher encounter draw, but my suspicion was the the difficult increase was due to some of the choices that the other player made or how our collective choices differed. Basically it seemed easier when I could see both hands and make all the choices.

One of my main reason for not playing 2 handed has to do with the extra bookkeeping, i can certainly see how it allows a solo player to come up with great synergy between the decks and use cards and keywords not really suitable to solo play. It's just too finicky for me. Another reason, is I don enjoy building 2 decks that work together, unless it is with another player. I can see myself trying to set up more broken card interactions, or setting up the decks that allow one deck to excel and carry the wait of the game while the other just provides card draw or resources for the other deck. Basically, when I was building some of these decks i was creating a partner deck that would be the suckiest deck for another player to play, because all that deck would do was support my deck which was doing most of the cool stuff. In 2 handed solo play that is no big deal, with another player that's pretty lame, unless they enjoy that role. That sort of became my approach, and of course each player can set there own limits for how they deal with this, but for me it became a boring exercise, because both decks sucked on their own, and were worthless for solo play which I enjoyed more anyway.

I have no problem with playing it either way and love playing 2 handed and with others.  I agree completely that this is a rule to stop one player from running things in general play, but should be implemented according to your group of players.  Tracker is dead on about the appeal of 2 handed as well, it opens strategies up that might not work with friends/pick up players.

## 36 [DC06675 on April 22, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/104370-table-talk-rule/?do=findComment&comment=1057328)

I would agree with Raven1015 in that it depends on the quests as to whether 2 handed solo is actually easier or harder than pure solo. A good example is the Fords of Isen and To Catch an Orc quests from the new VoI expansion.  These two quests are significantly easier solo than two-handed solo (in my opinion) because drawing multiple encounter cards per round really allows those encounter cards to synergize with one another.  I feel that the argument that pure solo is harder really only counts for a few of the newer quests and was truly more of a problem in the beginning when the quests didn't compensate well for having extra players. Now, most quests include on the quest cards (reveal or add 1 card per player), which has helped make the scenarios more balanced no matter how many players are playing.

 

As for table talk, I don't really abide by the rule because I too think it is a little pointless and not very thematic in my mind (i.e. if you are on a quest or in a battle, you would more likely yell to someone "hey, put on your citadel plate so that troll doesn't kill you the first time he swings at you" than you would say "hey, take one of my three Gondorian shields I happen to be carrying with me).  That is just me though, I have never understood the point of the rule (even the idea that one shouldn't dominate the game is really something that should be policed by the group). A lot about this game has grown and developed over the past three years and the table talk rule is one that really only stands to frustrate the true co-op aspects of this game imo.  Some people may like it and that is cool, but for me I find the game far more enjoyable when I can strategize with my 'team' rather than strategize to myself and hope we are on the same page. 

 

Either way the 'spirit of the game' is to have fun, so whatever floats your boat.

Just talk.  The point of the game is to have fun and what's the use of inviting your friends over to sit silently and read to yourselves.  The best social games (particularly co-op ones) are actually built around encouraging communication.  Mechanically, many of them don't even require multiple players.  The options are all face-up and on the table for everyone to see.  The fun comes through the communication between players as they argue, debate and contribute to the decisions that must be made every turn.  They are as much a social exercise as they are a game.  This is the same reason I don't play 2 handed solo.  While it may mechanically smooth out the game, the social aspect is lost and I think that's too integral a part of the game to go without.  I'll play normal solo, but it's not the same as sitting across from someone and trying to work together to win.

 

Preserving a little of each player's privacy in LotRtCG is both thematic and helpful for developing features which encourage communication.  Player A can't tell Player B what Denethor sees coming in the quest phase, but I think it's obvious that such knowledge was meant to be communicated.  Wide eyes and a cold sweat when you scry that card are just as engaging as jumping up and yelling "Oh crap!  ANOTHER Master's Malice!"  Do what feels natural without ruining the game for you.

 

I don't think it's necessary to include the table talk rule as it's written, but it's an excellent guideline.  Encourage open strategizing and also tactful insinuations.  The funny thing is, I never had to worry about this rule anyway.  When I play, their recommended communication level is just what feels natural to me.

 

Now that that's settled we can get back to gaming!  ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] jk

All players always see the card watched by Denethor, and all speak about keep or send to bottom. All players i know do it. How do you see this question? Is it cheat or ilegal?

I think not. However, if one tournament avoid it by any rule, then players dont do it. But normally, in normal and oficial games, usually do it.

Per the rules - the card that Denethor reveals is only available to that player. The other players shouldn't get to see it, and the Denethor player isn't meant to communicate what the card is.

Now it's all a bit fluffy really as most social interaction rules are. I'd like to use a clearer example from another FFG game to illustrate how I think it should be played - although the rules are fluffy and technically Denethor could say "hey guys, I feel we're going to need 4 more willpower than we thought " which doesn't read the name or text on the card - you could say "a lot" instead if you didn't want to read the 4 out at all.

 

 

In the Death Angel Card game every turn one player needs to reveal a new encounter card. Some of those cards have the rule Instinct. If that rule is on the card then the player has to make all decisions about the card (targeting choices and things) without consulting the other players. If it isn't they can discuss with other players before resolving the card.

Now I like this as a rule, because it preserves hidden information and means that individuals have to make choices by themselves - but which may influence the entire game. However not all decisions are like this. The preservation of hidden information in a co-op game is appealing because it lets people feel they personally have an impact on the game.

In the lord of the rings card game I've always personally liked to play with the encounter deck knowledge being like instinct - you have to decide without consulting.  The reason for this is because it's possible to play without the encounter deck knowledge at all - and therefore if not all players know it then the game can still function.

On the other hand if you tried to apply a strict similar interpretation to the player's hands you would lead to awkward situations - like I have a gandalf in hand, if I play it I can kill the enemy that means you can't quest with Eowyn - if you quest with Eowyn then I won't threat out and lose this round, but I'm not meant to tell you that I can play gandalf. However if I tell you to quest with Eowyn you must know I have a solution to the problem in hand anyway.

It's easier just to let people reveal relevant information from their hand. I mean playing with the whole hand revealed is less good (I know this because sometimes my wife and I have to do that because of our child), the game is better with hidden information. However trying to keep the whole hand hidden all the time leads to well, intentionally trying to make the game harder?

I'd like to play the game with no table talk (poker style) where you aren't allowed to ever discuss the actual cards sometime and see how it goes but more as an experiment than from the belief that it would be more fun playing that way.

As to the main topic -  I think I've come round to thinking that playing two handed is different enough that it can effect strategy and deck building; so I would not want the designers to start making cards that worked for it (mainly because I think cards for it would be a bit weak in a standard two player game). Although I doubt that it's different enough to negate the value of people engaging in debate even if that's exclusively what they play.

Besides our community is too small to start cutting people out :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

The bottom line of the table talk rule is that they try to eliminate the alfa "A" gamer. The truth is that telling other people what to do is a bad thing, but this is "your" parents job to teach you that not the rule book's, so is to judge, misjudge and discriminate other people choices (2hand play etc) ( "i" may feel that playing alone a board game is pathetic, but this is "my" opinion and i will never judge or misjudge any one for doing so )

Here are some other things to think about in 2 handed solo play vs regular 2 player.

When playing with 2 players most players have their own collection of cards, so some very good cards may be in both decks' like both players can have 3 copies on Northern Tracker on a quest that needs location control.

A solo 2 handed player that plays with real cards is less likely to do this since they might only have one core set, but if they had 3 core sets they could do it.

Also, 2 real players are less likely to both have SoG in their deck to play it one of the other players heroes. Sure I have ahd games where 2 players had SoG in the deck, but that was because the deck they were playing was built around a strategy that needed it, so they had every intention to play it on one of their heroes.

A solo player that has 3 cores sets could put 3 copies of SoG in each deck with the hope that it will show up earlier, and then play it on the hero of the deck that needs it.

These are some of the subtle differences that a player can make when he is building 2 decks and playing them as one. Resources and cards will be able to move freely between the 2 decks and strategies within the deck can be developed to take advantage of a player having control over both decks.

Of course, I don't see anything wrong with a player playing 2 handed solo, it's another way to enjoy the game and it can be still very challenging. Personally, i don't think designers should develop cards to support it, but honestly I do not know what a card like that would look like.

Comparing the difficulty of games when playing 1 hand solo play to 2 hand solo play really does not have anything to so with conversation. Since much of that has to do with how a scenario scales with the number of players. The major comparison has to do with 2 hand solo to 2 player game. This is where the table talk discussion is really important. Even players who completly ignore the table talk rule, probably allow some freedom in another player to make a choice, rather then telling them exactly what to do. If you are playing 2 handed solo you are telling both decks exactly what you what them to do. That's the major difference I see between the 2 types of playing, i am pretty sure this makes an impact on the game, does it make it easier? Well that's the question, right. i lean slightly towards yes.

someone tried to solo play four decks? ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]  I try this.  I build decks for four players, trying to base it on synegrii for example rohan-gondor, and building them so that transitions can  be as many quests without changes in decks (we have a chance to play every two months, so when already we meet, it a waste of time for us to build decks and changes with them, so these two months I tested alone, these four decks). 

 

Initially I considered the testing yourself four decks is easier than in a real game for four players - because in the end I see all the cards - but yourself It's hard sometimes concentrate on four decks and often I miss something, where on  four players, each player control your own deck and focuses only on him.

It has everything to do with the conversation because the original implication was that two-handed solo was a form of "cheating" pursued by solo players to make the game easier for themselves. In essence, the implied claim was that players do this instead of playing one-handed solo, rather than two players with table talk (because if another player was available, then they would just play two players, not two-handed solo). That means to me, the real comparison if we're debating the "cheating" argument is two-handed solo vs. one-handed solo.

This is a good point. In 2, 3, or 4 player games, it is much easier to load up on A Test of Will Spirit cancellation or threat reduction or Steward, but in two-handed play, I generally can give only one deck 3 copies of such a card.

Oh sorry, i guess I did not see that comparing the difficulty of one hand to 2 hand solo as being the major sticking point since so much of the difficulty just depends on what scenario one is playing.

I guess I found that the conversation about 2 handed solo compared to a 2 player game in relationship to table talk was the major question at hand here, since the encounter deck functions the same for both ways of playing. Comparing 1 hand solo to 2 hand solo is like comparing apples to oranges, while comparing 2 hand solo to 2 player game is more like comparing a Empire apple to a Pink Lady apple. Their both apples but they taste really different.

I had an idea.

 

If developers want players to respect 100% the talk rule, then they can release a player card that force us to return to reload our games.

 

For example, one card like: 'say a letter. If the other player has a card that its first letter is so, then...'. This card forces you to doesn't know absolutyely any card of your friends. So question would be close.

After, the problem is the cards in play that returns to one player's hand. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]. For example, Rumour From the Earth

Finally i designed a card, it is another theme at the end, but it has similar ways...

It is not the solution of the question talk rule, but it can help us to think about...

I almost always play solo two-handed, but that's mostly due to the size of my deck.

## 49 [Demoncow on April 25, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/104370-table-talk-rule/?do=findComment&comment=1062007)

I play everything from solo to 4 handed to 4 player, I've done it all, and the difficulty really depends on the quest.
