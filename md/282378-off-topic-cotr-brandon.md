I put a movie on while I'm working on something, never seen it before. But if I only ever remember one thing about Brandon, it's that he went to the movies on his wedding day to see it: Doom.

COTR Brandon prioritizing a terrible action movie before life stuff that is way more important? What else is new?

I love that you need to make the CotR distinction. :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Is this topic meant to be a eulogy for Brandon?

I think @player1683311 [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/189558-player1683311/] was just reminiscing Brandon's silliness, his memory sparked by a movie he watched.
