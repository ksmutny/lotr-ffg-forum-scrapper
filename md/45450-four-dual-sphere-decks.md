# [Four Dual-Sphere Decks](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45450-four-dual-sphere-decks/)

## 1 [Bohemond2 on April 19, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45450-four-dual-sphere-decks/?do=findComment&comment=455934)

I wanted to make four full 50 card decks, which can be put together with two core sets.  They are meant to be played with two or more players, and based off of the ideas dicussed in the thread on deck archetypes.  I built them today, but won't be able to actually play them for a day or two.  If anyone has any thoughts/reactions/questions/criticisms of how they work, I would love to hear.

I assume you mean Gimli, Gloin, and Thalin?

Since I'm haven't had a chance to play the game myself (and I don't plan on initially getting 2 boxes) I can't really comment on whether your decks would be good or not. However I am trying to create a Leadership/Spirit deck using Aragorn, Theodred, and Eleanor. I choose the Heros semi-randomly and am now trying to figure out what Player cards to use with them.  

Also I'm using Ld as the abbreviation for Leadership and L for Lore so that I can make a Ld/L deck without confusing myself.

Whoops, I forgot the third dwarf.  Thanks for catching that.  Given Eowyn's power, I wanted to pair her with the card drawing abilities in lore.  However, she is an amazing character, so you can't go wrong with including her in your leadership/spirit deck.

I haven't yet played this game so keep that in mind while I talk about my deck idea.

One of my ideas when creating this deck was choosing Heros at random and seeing what the result would be. My first two random heros were Aragorn and Eleanor. Since I didn't want to play a 3 sphere deck the third random character came from either Leadership or Spirit and it was Theodred.

Once I had my characters I wanted to figure out what their advantages where. One things that Eleanor and A Test of Will let me ignore or replace every Treachery that comes my way. Ld/S also has several different ways of readying Heros. Unexpected Courage, Ever Vigilant, Grim Resolve, and Aragorn are all ways to let Heros to multiple things per turn. Leadership also has many resource improving cards to help with playing a dual sphere. Steward of Gondor, Celebrain's Stone, and Theodred all help me afford things. 

I thing the standard way of playing would be to sent Theodred and Aragorn off questing. Aragorn readies himself. Eleanor either prevents Treachery cards or defends against Enemies. Aragorn then attacks.The willpower of them isn't very high but they should be able to keep the enemies and locations in the staging area low and make steady progress. 

Or at least that is what I envision. Once I actually play the deck I might find that I get totally slaughtered every time. 

 

Now for some uncertain thoughts on one of your decks so that I don't just will up your thread with me talking about me. Your Women of Middle Earth deck (S/L) looks good and will likely quickly deal with locations and quests. However it will probably have the most trouble with enemies. For some reason the idea of including powerful allies Beorn just to discard them with Eleanor and then bring them back with Stand and Fight sounds like a clever idea. I have no idea how well that would actually work but it sound cool.

(sidenote, like many I have not played yet - so this is sure to change drastically)

I will be rocking:

Aragon (standing just seems too good - using the same guy with strong stats twice for 1?)

Gloin (try to mix in some healing to get extra resources as well, if not every turn then at the beginning of the game to get allies out)

Eowyn (4 willpower/wisdom? is needed to rush through)

Then mix in what I think is the best card in the game (Steward of Gondor, which effectively brings your resources up 66%), Gandalf/Sneak Attack/Valiant Sacrifice, probably Celebrains Stone to make Aragorn even more beefy for Quest/Attack.

Eowyn will probably just be there for Gandalf, and some of the Shadow Cancel cards.  Oh, and probalby Unexpected Courage to have someone else (Aragorn AGAIN?) keep straightening.

Can't wait to build my first 'Super-Aragorn' deck ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

Super-Aragorn

Celebrian's Stone

Steward of Gondor

The Favor of the Lady x3

Unexpected Courage x3

 

Imagine it....

Aragorn commits to a quest with his 7 Willpower then he uses his ability to ready.

Aragorn defends against two of the Enemies attacking him with his 2 Defence and readying each time with Unexpected Courage.

Aragorn attacks both of the Enemies he just defended against with his 3 Attack using his last Unexpected Courage to ready before the second attack.

 

It would be even nastier if you made a Spirit/Leadership/Tactics deck and gave him three Dwarven Axes to boost his Attack up to 6.

Remember, both Dwarven axe and Celebrain's Stone are restricted, so no loading up with three axes.

Oh, your right. Darn, another brilliant scheme foiled again by the rules! lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif]
