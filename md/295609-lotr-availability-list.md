# [LOTR Availability list](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/295609-lotr-availability-list/)

So, I did a thing. Since there are posts all over the community where people are looking for specific expansions, I decided to make a list out of it. You can find that list here: https://docs.google.com/…/1jEB-tGlr21kKTt7QnffQ8kdxbd…/edit… [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jEB-tGlr21kKTt7QnffQ8kdxbdNVabZgZqgKf50bRwE/edit?usp=sharing&fbclid=IwAR1lb0DArwyT0RVONYH8cQzfIZIngXQNEtVX0XAYxAWDzLXjiaAl1TVS_ug]

On this list, you can find if the product is available via FFG, how the community regards its availability and a list of URLs to shops that sell that expansion.

I also need your input for this list. If you have an expansion for sale, then you can add it to the list. If a link has expired or there is no more available via that link, please delete it. If you find another shop that sells it, add the link to the list.

To international players, please specify the country of origin, and if you are willing to buy the pack and ship it to the buyer if there is no international shipping via the shop.
English expansions only, for now. If you want to make a tab for French, German, Spanish, or Polish translated versions, please add them in a separate tab below.

I hope people will step up to keep this updated frequently because I also have a blog to maintain and can't be asked to do both on top of my graduation assignment. I hope this got the ball rolling!

Good Morning,

     Thank you for creating this.  I really feel this will help with finding some of the harder-to-find items.

Good to hear, people are still looking for some of those packs. Could you update the sheets with the exact link in your region? I am sure that people have been wanting to get their hands on these for a while!
