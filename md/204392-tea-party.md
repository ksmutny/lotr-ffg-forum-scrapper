Glorfindel and Elrond invited Gandalf for a cup of tea in the ettenmoors. The ents fought of most of the nuisance. Some of these decks are so strong with all the new noldor support. First time i feel things are at least partly in my hands. The tea was nice, but i thirst for something hotter, where dost thou linger flame if the west?

I'm very confused, what did I just read?

Stylized session report, I presume. And longing for the next saga box.

English Breakfast or Earl Grey?

I haven't played it, but I'm told Across the Ettenmoors was pretty easy anyway.
