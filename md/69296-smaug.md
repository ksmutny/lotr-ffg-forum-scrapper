 Three of them!  Sweet Holy Moley!  And damage to Laketown?!

Sounds like this one will require multiplayer to have a chance.  We're gonna need a bigger bow.

yeah, the description from FFG said something along the lines of saving the town while also trying to defeat smaug. dunno if it's a "time clock" or lake town can only take so much damage. either way, seems like a cool mechanic!

## 6 [John85 on August 17, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69296-smaug/?do=findComment&comment=675405)

This should be interesting, I see the possibility for at least four new mechanics:

1) Burn damage (although not italicized, apparently it comes into play).

2) Beat the clock (maybe this isn't new really, but certainly is explicit here).

3) Damaged ally locations (along with 2, perhaps we'll get some event cards to repair structures in addition to healing heroes/allies; I'm reminded of RTS games for some reason)

4) Multi-stage enemies (maybe this isn't how the different Smaugs are intended to operate, but I can imagine that the quest cards have low progress and "defeat Smaug _______ to advance to the next stage" on them; this should fulfill the hopes of several folks I've seen on the boards requesting harder/different enemies and different enemy mechanics)

Additionally following on "Bullroarer"'s comment (nice reference btw), it looks like I may have to start some playing multi-player (or at least play two handed)

All in all, waiting for new info has been a pain, but it looks like it was worth it (now come on POD!!!)

And I feel terrible for forgetting to mention this in the previous comment, but way to go C. Burdett with the depictions of Smaug, better than I could have asked for!!!!aplauso.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/aplauso.gif]

ill be really dissapointed if this isnt playable solo

2 handed's a poor replacement

## 9 [Glaurung on August 17, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69296-smaug/?do=findComment&comment=675451)

First i though for different stages of the quests we have different Smaug but he have when revealed effect……So we have 3 copies f Smaug in encounter deck or what??? Hmmmm sounds quite interesting

## 10 [Duftpunk on August 17, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69296-smaug/?do=findComment&comment=675466)

 I don't know what they mean by "when revealed move damage from smaug to lake-town. Is it in case of some response effects on heroes that deal damage as soon as card is revealed from encounter deck to staging area?

Could be both. Like insert on stage 2 "Smaug the Whatever" to your encounter deck, and so on.

Let's see what people say about the scenario!

## 12 [Dam the Man on August 17, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69296-smaug/?do=findComment&comment=675532)

Hehe, if Smaug is only in the Encounter deck, Denethor owns him. Also, not an Objective and not worth VP, remove him via Out of the Wild lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif] . As mentioned in the Immune thread, while still in the Encounter deck, he isn't in play, so his immunity wouldn't apply, right?

Here's my guess:  While there are three copies of Smaug, I think that as each new one is revealed, the previous damage travels with him.  His abilities change though as his rage increases.

## 14 [John85 on August 17, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69296-smaug/?do=findComment&comment=675576)

That would work ^^^

You may be right, it makes sense. I would say that setup instructions for first part of the quest will say look for smaug the magnificent and place it in staging area. And as you progress with quest the setup instructions will say swap it for smaug the mighty (or whatever is that card called) and last one you will swap it for smaug the terrible and the goal will be obvious protect lake-town and slay smaug. Survival kind of thing.

my guess would be that they would be removed and placed out of play as per instructons in 1a of the quest card or somthing like that.. otherwise.. yes this would be trivial to beat with those cards you mentioned.

## 17 [Sprenger on August 18, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69296-smaug/?do=findComment&comment=675969)

Does anyone know if they are selling this quest or giving out at GenCon? If not is there any word on when it will be released?

no word.. but it is a pretty surew thing that it will be released as a PoD eventually. When massing came out people were buying it for 100+ bucks for a few months untill it came out.. do not fall into this trap.. I am sure the PoD will be out in time.

## 19 [Sprenger on August 18, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69296-smaug/?do=findComment&comment=675972)

For those have played the quest how does it compare to the Witchking quest?

(I really don't expect response to this until next week)

On the "Gen Con Day 2" video on the news page it is confirmed that it'll be released as POD shortly, or somesuch timeframe.

Smaug is the man… The best Snack Bar in the hole Middle Earth: Hot and Crispy!

:-)

So another level 9 quest for Glaurung! And the rest of us keep on hurting ourself ;-)

Word on BGG is that nobody beat this quest during the GenCon event.

## 24 [Shockeffect on August 19, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69296-smaug/?do=findComment&comment=676428)

The video of GenCon day two says that a couple people beat it, im pretty sure.

Yes yes i love it. But still cannot make  MAO with 4 players. Very very difficult!!!

## 26 [lleimmoen on August 19, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69296-smaug/?do=findComment&comment=676567)

Me neither, haven't tried it that many times but four player Osgiliath seems close to impossible. I had though the same about it solo when it first came out but with the current line-up, Beravor (even after the shaft), Elrond and Glorfindel (Spirit) I can finally say I am confident of beating it much more often than losing it.

I think the Lake Town challenge might be very different, surely something new and it may take time to realize a good strategy against it. When Osgiliath was first previewed, people were also screaming though.

Yup. "Two teams have already beaten it" was part of what he said. And he (or was it the other guy?) also said that it would come as pod VERY soon. So according to FFG timeline that's, what, 2 month from now lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif]

Just checked my order history: I ordered Massing on September 21st and I believe I ordered it the day it was announced. Dunno if it'll be faster this time, but we might have a month or so to wait.

## 29 [Narsil0420 on August 19, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69296-smaug/?do=findComment&comment=676797)

I hope we DO have to wait for it! We need something to fill the 4 month gap between the two Hobbit expansions!

I have played the quest 3 times… it is extremely difficult… the toughest by far. I have beaten the Witchking at the Massing numerous times… but I haven't even made it to the third stage yet.

And for those wondering about the quest… you have a burn keyword that inflict damage on Laketown. Locations will have Burn X on them and treacheries/ Smaug will trigger the Burn to deal damage to Laketown… also there is a Smaug deck and every round a new card is revealed from the Smaug deck. 

Very unique quest… very nicely done. This is might be my favorite quest to date.

Anything anyone can remember would be great for those of us in far away lands from America!

!!!!!!!!!SPOILERS!!!!!!!!

 

Well if you insist… The quest is very unique in that the encounter deck consists of a ton of locations and no enemies… in fact you only have 1 enemy and that is Smaug and at the beginning of the game you create a separate "Smaug deck" which has 3 copies of each version of Smaug (I believe it is 3 copies). You also have Lake Town Objective card in the staging area. If Lake Town receives 50 damage the players lose. Every round at the beginning of the Quest phase the first player has a decision to either let Smaug go to the staging area or face him directly. Once that is decided a new version of Smaug is revealed from the "Smaug deck" and the other Smaug (if there was one) is discarded. You also have the burn mechanic where the town will burn through treacheries and each location has a "Burn X" where that is how much damage Lake Town will receive if you are told to resolve all Burn damage. You do have ways of healing Lake Town in the 2nd stage and Smaug can only take so much damage throughout the quest (max of 6 damage in stage 1 and 12 damage in stage 2, so you can't just kill him at the beginning). Also you have the Old Thrush Objective card that can help reduce Smaug's defense. You will also use the location's victory points to heal Lake Town as well. So that is as much as I want to give away… like I said the quest is very unique and extremely sweet! Also the end of the quest you will need to defeat Smaug and heal Lake Town to win.
