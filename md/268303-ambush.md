Hello! Can you explain me what Ambush means in The DIGITAL card game.

Bow of the Galadhrim gives +1 Attack and Ambush.

If character with Ambush kills an enemy, it doesn't take damage from that enemy.

Off-topic, but it seems that FFI (Luke) are active on the Steam page. Might be good to post questions there as well.
