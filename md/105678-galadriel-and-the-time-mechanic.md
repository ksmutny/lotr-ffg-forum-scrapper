This was to come surely. Still off the preview thread, I wanted to discuss one thing. With Galadriel, we have got the first hero who can reduce threat repeatedly in every round. I believe it is a mile-stone of sorts, and fitting for such an iconic hero. In solo play this can easily lead to much stalling, if one really wants to. Thus, the time mechanic seems very appropriate again, something that perhaps should have existed from the beginning. Of course the raising of the threat works in a similar way, but only unless you find effective ways to mitigate the rise.

 

Much has already been said about Galadriel herself, and much will be before she officially arrives. Together with Celeborn, Silvan allies will become very powerful having all-round boosted stats (save hp which may still cause problems) and double use on the first round. The returning events and proper resource management will be key to the strategy, I feel. And the best thing about it, the whole idea is not straight-forward, one might be faced with many interesting decisions, including Galadriel herself. Of course you can play UC on her but unless she has Neny, you would be wasting resources. Even after the Ring, Silvan might be more than capable of questing enough without the support of the Lady. For me, the very important aspect of Nenya is that it gives the Lore icon, as neither Celeborn or Galadriel are Lore but the Silvan allies often are.

I mostly agree. And I do think she is awesome. But I can't help feeling a little disappointed that she can't quest. I think I would be more thematic if she could quest. Even though she has some really good abilities she is more or less useless. Useless in the way that she is taking up a hero spot. Think if the first Bilbo hero couldn't do anything else than providing his ability of card draw. Don't think many would use him then. I wouldn't have a hero in my decks that can't do anything than what some events or other hero can do better. But that's my opinion and I respect everyone who is surely to disagree :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

As is laid out in the preview: Galadriel´s ability to ad her willpower to another (when you have Nenya) after questing has begun is quite powerful, seeing as you can wait before exhausting her, awaiting the development from the encounter deck.

 

On a side note: Galadriel´s willpower can still come in quite handy when you have to exhaust characters for their willpower other than questing (escape tests fx).

However, you only need 1 card to make her able to contribute her willpower of 4. One card is not too much. But even if you do not have Nenya, she still draws a card and lowers threat. As I said above, for solo play this is incredibly useful. I tried her out as a proxy already last night, and against some of the older quests, even the harder ones like Massing at Osgiliath, I could just keep the threat at opening level, pretty much. What is even more important however, is the "keeping ready" ability. I think it is invaluable, especially with the Silvan. Celeborn turns any Silvan into a useful quester and fighter, and Galadriel makes them be both in the round they come into play. Silvan Refugee is 3 willpower quester who stays in play to chump block or contribute 1 attack -- all that for 1 resource. Henamarth Riversong is 2 willpower, 2 attack, with a useful ability. Once we get more cheaper Silvan allies, like Naith Guide, the whole thing will be even more interesting.

 

Finally the example with Bilbo Baggins is a bit heartbreaking for my favourite Hobbit. He is just the same threat cost as Galadriel, she can do the drawing at any given moment together with threat reduction, and she has got the incredible passive ability. Bilbo's advantage is his one action but the stats make it not a very advantageous one.

Shadow and Flame is the quest where you are set to 0 threat right away right? In that quest you could potentially avoid ever being attacked by the balrog if you use Galadriel. That's immensely powerful. Op is probably right: time mechanic is very important for keeping things challenging with cards like Galadriel around.

Yes, and it is not only here where you could keep it at 0. Many quests have a certain threshold that are bad to pass. Of course you can still get in trouble with an untimely treachery or so, but Galadriel makes this much less likely. The spoilt Galadhrim Minstrel (see Dunland Trap preview) also seems to be searching your deck for something, if that something is Event cards, then getting early A Test of Will will have become easier.

I think that's ok. I'd prefer to have heroes with unique abilities that mess up with certain quests. It's no problem to ban said hero from a quest if you think he destroys it.

Yeah, we are bound to have quests that certain heroes will absolutely shine at, like Tactics Boromir in Assault on Osgiliath (quite appropriately actually). However, I was referring to the stalling strategies overall, and I am glad that something like the Time Mechanic has appeared.

Yea, I've been thinking it was probably allies this whole time, but events makes sense too. I assume its not attachments because w don't need 2 Masters of the Forge in Lore and it doesn't make as much sense with the theme of a minstrel.

Yeah, for me minstrel would more likely mean events, though I guess it could be viewed both ways, her singing could lure others in but the singing itself is perhaps better represented by "events". It is also a bit less straightforward, searching for cheap Silvan allies would be even more powerful perhaps. Also the minstrel could find another, etc.

Even if he just returns a silvan ally to your hand he will combo with rumil and naith guide very well. Double use of rumils damage ability, the second time with one more damage! (I'm assuming Orophin will have ranged, the card looks like there is space for it)

Never mind, any thoughtful discussion is good. I am greatly looking forward to Orophin, what a remarkable art, I find. I really think he brings them back from the discard pile, because otherwise he would be just like all the events...

What? You hablas Ingles? You just say stuff like that as if it were a fact, whilst it is not and I just wait if you are ever going to say you were wrong; not that it matters much. The sentence above stating it impossible that an ally could cost 3 and still bring allies from discard pile, it is just pure nonsense. How do you like that for a one-liner?

Regardless of your perception of how I say it, the stuff I say remains my opinion on the matter, and it can't be a fact until we see the actual text of the card. What I am judging from is bringing somebody from discard pile is a very powerful and rare ability. While in history of LotR, leadership allies tend to be overpriced because of natural resource richness of the sphere, while Orophin costs only 3 for his pretty good stats. Returning an acual ally from play to your hand may be a temporal disadvantage, thus the small cost of 3. Do I even need to say that it's just my analysis of matter in question and it does not pretends to be anything official and stuff?

## 21 [joezim007 on May 12, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/105678-galadriel-and-the-time-mechanic/?do=findComment&comment=1081423)

I think Trololo is right. It makes more sense synergistically and it makes more sense cost-wise. I understand that it makes him have an ability that is very similar to the spoiled events, but the fact that the ability is now on an ally makes it unique enough. Neither of us is saying that it can't be pulling from the discard pile but the evidence seems to point more toward pulling from play.

lleimmoen, I think Trololo's reply was perfectly valid and that you over-reacted. I think you perceived something that wasn't there and this time you're being the antagonist.

No, this is a very good analysis, and I would almost tend to agree with it, had I not taken into account that all the events (of which we shall see four) shall be bringing allies from play, so I cannot think Orophin might as well. But that is really secondary, what I was a bit concerned about was the way you shared your opinion at first. It wasn't insulting but it felt sort of scornful which I don't think is appropriate here. Of course I would not take your opinions away from you, it just seemed you are trying to laugh off others'. Now we can wait and see who was closer to the truth with his guess -- but that, again, is just a side thing.

Well, not everyone likes to write long sophisticated posts. Especially when English is not your mother tongue. There were lots of occassions in which I would have liked to write more, but gave up because I couldn't find the words.

 

But yeah, I know what you mean, but I think in this case it doesn't fit.

My point was simply that people jump to the conclusion that someone else is being rude too quickly. This is the internet, where we've taught ourselves to be short and sweet, so a short reply - with or without arguments - is not necessarily being rude. An antagonist is "somebody or something opposing or in conflict with another"; it's not simply a term associated with movies or plays. I'm saying that you are seeking confrontation where others are simply stating their opinion.

I hope I don't have to jump in to break up any more fights on here for a while. It seems to be getting a little too common. Can't we all just respect one another?

It didn't actually. It lacked the direction to make it mean what you clarified it too. (Your entire post is only a statement that he wouldn't have cost 3). You felt it was clear you meant that it cost too little because the ability would be a strong one.

However it could just have easily have been that you thought the ability was too weak for a cost of 3.

The "implicaiton" doesn't exist at all in your one sentence. Your clarification (that leadership allies are generally over-costed and that the ability is very rare) is much  more valuable. I think Lleimmoen would have appreciated that extra bit in your first response.

Which I think is the entire misunderstanding here. I don't mean to complain if it really is an English second language issue as Leptokurt suggests, however people are going to misinterpret your intention if it isn't as clear as you think it is.


As for the topic at hand -

I completely agree that threat isn't and never has been a good time mechanic in the game. It functions like that for most decks but not ones that have a lot of threat reduction. (Thematically the threat mechanic really represents rising danger rather than time running out).

On the other hand I don't think that being able to reduce your threat by 1 every turn will be a problem in most quests (some as already mentioned, are ruined by it). Galadrim's Greeting already allowed you to reduce your threat by a massive 18 per game (if you draw all 3 - but your chances of doing so are greatly increased by playing a deck that can go longer because of threat reduction).

It already is the case that if you choose to play a threat reduction strategy of any kind you can completely ignore the risk of time running out. Obviously this reduces your other cards so it's not necessarily a flaw in design - however I feel a built in time mechanic for quests that want to be timed would be better.

We do have some examples though - locations that take damage and you lose if they're killed (all you need is for them to take 1 damage a turn as a forced effect on the card to get a built in maximum time limit) or the first hobbit saga quest which really feels like you're playing until dawn.

The question I would ask is, how important is a time mechanic to all quests? Does it really matter on a quest that isn't about threat to make you lose.

If you're not an adult, you should probably talk to your parents about how to behave properly.

 

If you are an adult, which I find rather unlikely, you should probably stop acting like you're 12.

Are there other unresolved issues at work here? I don't see how just this could develop into name-calling in the first place.

 

Age and nationality is irrelevant here; it's a community for everyone, and arguments like this drag it down.

That's why I was asking Trololo. If you (try to) discuss with someone age is something very important. If Trololo is as young as I think he is, it might explain his behaviour. I am a teacher myself and I deal with these kind of statements daily. Young people have yet to learn how to discuss properly. And 12 is the age when they usually start to emphazise and talk sensitive.

 

So either Trololo is just to young to express himself, or he is annoying people on purpose. If it's the latter, ignoring his posts might truly be the best way to set this forum to the standards that we use to have.This forum is for sharing and discussing your opinion, not for constantly shouting things and to ignore other posters that give you a sophisticated answer.

What information do we all have to says we will get a return to hand event for each sphere? I've only seen the lore and no mention/hint of the other. And definitely no confirmation of all 4.

I wasn't sure whether to just leave this all alone and let it die or what..

But then I read this, good job Olorin, got to keep thing civil between us all and chill the f out.

You should look properly then. And perhaps speak less hastily of things others know more about. Lleimmoen is right, there is a Spirit version spoilt in the Nin-in-Eilph article, and Tactics in the Dunland Trap. Do you think if there are three, there will not be four?

Exactly, so the Leadership is coming too. And since there is Naith Guide and Galadhrim Minstrel, it is easy to guess there will be a Tactics and Spirit 2-cost Silvan ally as well. Put three of these allies (sans Tactics) and events (sans Tactics), together with Celeborn and Galadriel, and you have a good base for a wonderful deck, I feel.

> Shadow and Flame is the quest where you are set to 0 threat right away right? In that quest you could potentially avoid ever being attacked by the balrog if you use Galadriel. That's immensely powerful. Op is probably right: time mechanic is very important for keeping things challenging with cards like Galadriel around.

I gave S&F a try with Galadriel. I won In 14 rounds with 0 threat. The only time I was attacked was from 1 treachery, transition to stage 3 and twice to in order to engage and deal damage to the Balrog. It took 14 rounds because I was using Silvan trait deck, and it was difficult to muster up enough attack until late in the game.

There are no doomed cards in the deck so, as long as you quest successfully each round Galadriel keeps the Balrog tamed until your ready to attack.

Sound a bit boring no?

Sure was, but I had to try it.

The only tension was making sure I quested sucessfully each round. If threat ever got beyond 1 I'd be in trouble, and probably lose miserably, since silvan will not be able to chump block to victory on this quest. Every allies attack value was critical to success.

That's why I asked a question so people could remind me. I didn't say anyone was wrong so idk why you are attacking me. And like I said we don't have any CONFIRMATION that there will be 4. I don't doubt there will be all 4 spheres but we don't have official news to state for a fact that we do.

What's the issue here? Nothing I said could have even been taken as aggressive.

Perhaps it's because your av looks so aggressive? :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

 

But yeah, I don't read your post as aggressive. And yes, it's totally ok to ask questions, and even to have an opinion,  even if some here already know the answer.

And I do not see what is aggressive about my response. This really gets me on this side, people who say things freely feel attacked when someone tells them they were wrong. I certainly did not try to attack anyone, I felt like defending the one who was right. I would even apologize had I known for what. Peace people!

I certainly don't think you're an aggressive person. However  sentence like "And perhaps speak less hastily of things others know more about" sounds a bit snotty.

I don't care to carry it on. But I'm glad you at least get where I was coming from.
