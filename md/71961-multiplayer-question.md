apologies for the extremely simple question but im trying out two handed decks and am having to learn multiplayer rules as ive only played solo

anyways….does 'in play' mean all players characters? so can i have elladan on one player and elrohir on the other, and they both still get the effect?

thanks

 "In play" is a global thing, so yes.
