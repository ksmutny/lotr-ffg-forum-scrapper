I find it interesting that there are enemies with Orc trait but without Goblin trait.

Loving the nightmare khazad dum quests! into the pit and seventh level are both very fun!

Also just wanted to say I love hall of beorn and the card search function as well. Really cool blog, along with masteroflore and talesfromthecards, that really helps and promotes the community for this game!

Your card search has the nightmare hobbit decks which I couldn't find anywhere else. Someday ill hopegully get my hands on them! Many thanks

Yeah I love that. Cool differentiation between different types/breeds of orcs. Also works well with the goblin resource mechanic on seventh level, if Marul and the taskmasters got resource counters that quest would be impossible.

this is the nightmare pack I have been waiting for. I have the thing on order.. should be here any day now. Seriously good news. Khaz / Darowdelf was the high point of the game for me, it never was fresher or more exciting than when they came out.

Yea. This was the time where it felt like we finally were starting to get a decent-sized card pool and enough quests ti keep you occupied a bit.
