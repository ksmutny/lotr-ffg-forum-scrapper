Hi All,

 

I have had a search on the forum's and can't find an answer so I am hoping you can help.

 

We had a situation playing Ruins of Belegost where we had no active location and the Nameless Cave Dweller appeared from the encounter deck. It has X threat, attack and defence, where X is 1 more than the Discover value on the active location. 

 

The question is this - As there is no active location what is it's value? We played it as 0 as it needs a Discover value to add 1 to. You can't add 1 to something that doesn't exist..... right?

The flip side to the arguement would be that it is 1..... 0 + 1 = 1. 

 

Any help would be appreciated. I thought the play testers may well have encountered this one and clarified before printing.....

 

Thanks in advance.

If there is no active location the Discover value is 0, so the Nameless Cave Dweller is 1.

Just to add to what PocketWraith said, there is a video of the developers of the game playing The Murder at the Prancing Pony where there are a couple effects that say "X is 1 more than the Investigate value on the active location".  These effects appeared, I believe 2-3 times when they had no active location, and I believe they played it as 1 if my memory serves me correctly.

 

For your reference, the cards in question are Smoke and Mirrors and Deadly Accusations.  The video can be found in this thread. [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/217060-matt-the-caleb-vs-murder-at-the-prancing-pony/]

Just assume X is always 0 unless a specific condition is met. In this case the Nameless Cave Dweller's X value would always be 0 until there is an Active Location with a Discover value to increase it. You played it right, he would have 1 to all his stats since he has an X value of 0 at that moment with no active location, so 0 + 1 = 1.

Thanks for the responses and clearing this up for me.
