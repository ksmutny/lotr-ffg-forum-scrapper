new preview up….quests won on attack and defense instead of willpower!! sorpresa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sorpresa.gif]

this really is a turning point in the game

also the siege on cair andros really solidifies the idea that were getting rangers

I almost quit playing this game in the early days.  I'm really glad I stuck it out.  These new mechanics sound like a lot of fun.

So that's what they meant about new ways of questing in the first preview… This is going to be a very interesting box…

But seriously, how beautiful is the artwork on The Citadel?

no matter where we go- the location art will always be a winner in this game, plus with the sieges i think they will be very atmospheric

well done ffg!

These new dynamics are so intriguing! I can't wait to get Legolas and Gimli up there on those walls, get Keeping Count on them and have fun bashing orcs around!

One thing that I noticed was that the quest card shown is stage 1B of what I believe they briefly mentioned would be the third scenario. However, it seems like you're kind of coming in towards the middle of some larger battle. I'm wondering if there is some sort of Ranger mission in Ithilien as the second scenario where you're trying to warn or make your way to Cair Andros.

Just some thoughts. I can't wait for this guys, this is going to be awesome!

Now to go read up on Cair Andros…

This update is mouth-wateringly cool. This looks like it's gonna be a great cycle!

cair andros was of strategic importance to gondor due to it protecting the crossing of the river anduin, it was breached in the war of the ring and tried to hold off the rohan cavalry

so im guessing that we shall have a meet up with the rangers of ithillien and have to hold them back, then perhaps we win and they decide to attack osgillaith instead, so basically cair andros is jus the warm up in the numenor pack with osgillaith in the cycle number 6  pack- just speculation

 I think the timing of these new quest mechanics is great! I love the game, but needed something to make it new again. I am really excited to see what kind of deck building changes occur from this. I have two decks that I really like, both for solo and multi player, but I'm not sure how they would do in these quests!

The company GTS Distribution has this coming out in November, but I hope it is sooner!

very exciting news overall.  seems like a cool way to keep the game fresh.

I wonder however if this new mechanic will make willpower themed characters and cards obsolete.  

It will def make solo tactics playable however

Well, after all of the complaining abt Tactics sucking solo, we had to assume something would happen to help out. This is the biggest something imaginable.

Some good news.

I was thinking of Boromir first. Not only thematically but also due to Battle and Siege mechanics; he can quest well in either and fight at the same time. I really feel he shall be invaluable, especially given we will see quite a few synergies for Gondor, like the previewed Blood of Númenor - further implying it is best to use Spirit with Boromir.

I think you will still have to quest with Willpower. I believe it might be different from stage to stage, like Siege, Battle, normal. But I definitelly hope Siege and Battle are important - and will be carried on for quite some time. It might be the best way to make Tactics shine. (I was thinking of something like this ever since the treachery card in Dead Marshes that made you use Attack instead of Willpower for the escape test; now it is here, hurray.)

yes i dont think all stages shall be siege or battle, and i hope that we have half of the quests standard 'journey/adventure' quests

if they're going to start using attack for questing, maybe they will start to use will for something else as well.

maybe they could introduce a "fear" type of thing. certain locations and enemies might be so fearful that it damages us, or makes our characters exhaust so they cant do anything. and the only way to combat that would be to have characters with a high will. i think that would be quite a good and thematic new use for will.

i can imagine a big battle in the next cycle where the nazgul swoop down. it would be good if all our lowly characters freeze up, and only the brave ones with high will carry on fighting

I think you are right in that we shall see new ways of using willpower (perhaps similar to what we saw in the Redhorn Gate). However, I don't think the theme of the game is to equal fear with low willpower. Certainly characters like Beorn could not be viewed as fearful. I believe, thematically, willpower could be viewed more like commitment to a certain goal (quest).

perhaps the fear could take all of the stats together and then take a total result….still heros like glorfindel would be lower this way, which is obviously thematically wrong

This looks awesome! My friend owns the game and he will probably want to get this one ASAP.

In fan made scenario Barrow Downs there actually is an mechanit where Barrow wights attack with will power, so it actually works guite well!
