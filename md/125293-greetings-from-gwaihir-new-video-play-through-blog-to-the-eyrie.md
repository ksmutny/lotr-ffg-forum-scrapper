For those interested in video play-throughs, check out my new blog: To the Eyrie. Below is an excerpt from my "about" page. Hope you enjoy!

Greetings from Gwaihir, Lord of the Winds!

I am Gwaihir, Lord of the Winds,the greatest and swiftest of the Eagles of Middle-earth. As protector of Elves, Men, and all Free Folk, To the Eyrie is my gift to you, the heroes, who travel far and wide within the wondrous and perilous world imagined by J.R.R. Tolkien and brought to our table tops by Fantasy Flight’s LCG, The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game. As primarily a solo player (my wingspan is too large to accommodate other winged friends, and besides, the other Eagles are still jealous about my tiny crown), this blog will specifically approach The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game from the “solo player perspective,” and thus, it will discuss quest mechanics and deck design accordingly.

 

Furthermore, since there already exists excellent blogs and podcasts that discuss the player cards, deck design, and provide encounter set reviews (see: Tales from the Cards [http://talesfromthecards.wordpress.com/], Hall of Beorn [http://hallofbeorn.wordpress.com/],  Cardboard of the Rings [http://cardboardoftherings.com/], and The Grey Company [https://greycompanypodcast.wordpress.com/]) the primary purpose of this blog is to provide video solo play-throughs of various quests using the physical cards (there’s nothing like the feel of cardboard between your talons!). While I am Lord of the Winds, I am by no means “Lord of the Game” and so do not presume to be an “expert” when it comes to playing the game. I simply enjoy the game, storyline, and  community that encompasses this LCG (although, like Matthew D.,  I am also “no slave to theme”). Nevertheless, I hope these videos  will appeal to fans of Gwaihir’s favorite game about his favorite books.

 

As you journey the road, may you frequent my eyrie to watch video play-throughs of your favorite quests and gain an “eyrie vision” on how to successfully make your way through various scenarios from the game (including nightmare mode). Until then, may you farewell, wherever you fare, till your eyries receive at the journey’s end!

Just start to look. Sounds good but i suggest you rise quality of the video. 360p is not enough to see all cards clean

Hmm i though when you play top card of your deck with a Gandlaf ability you can play use recourses only from Gandalf pool..... 

 

Anyway I'm not sure about....

Thanks Glaurung. I will see about raising the quality of the video. This was my "trial run" so I appreciate all the feedback.

The card says nothing about not using other hero's resources. It only says that you can play it "as if it was in your hand" which means, just like how you pay for other cards in your hand you can use resources from all three heroes, as long as they match. I am pretty sure it is a valid play.

Hey man i just realise Howling wargs have a surge keyword. You forget about it?   Anyway is not change a game to much since That Gandalf decks is crazy powerful but anyway surge is surge.

 

I would like to see some Nightmare play  with that deck. Standard is a joke for that deck!

Great video and great deck.

 

I have made another version of this deck with hidden cache in order to have a ressources generator.

 

I think that a little mistake has been done during play.

On second turn, You play Gwaihir with Elrond and Vylia.

You use the response of Gwaihir and bring back into play from discard pile a Descendant of Thorondor.

But at the end of the turn, you didn't bring back to your hand the descendant of Thorondor as Gwaihir's response required.

The Howling Warg does not have surge. You may mean the Hound of Sauron. But he was not revealed, he was discarded when the Great Warg Chief engaged me, so surge does not trigger.

 

And yes, I will play nightmare with this deck soon.

Yes. The deck list on the blog. In truth, it is the same deck I posted on the forums a bit ago (Gandalf & Gwaihir Fly to Mt. Doom) with some minor changes, and that is because I am Gwaihir. I decided to make a new log in name to tie in with the blog. "Kyrie" actually means "Lord" in Latin. So it is fitting for me to be Gwaihir, "Lord" of the Winds.

 

Anyways, hope you find the list on the site and enjoy!

Ha ha ha. Hall of Beorn site have a wrong text for Hwarg. They have a surge in text on the site not in text in the card. So that why I though wargs a surge….

Show us Nightmare play witj that deck. That will be cool. Let say Anduin nightmare. Should be fun!

Gandalf hero is very powerful. Almost overpower but this may be only way to beat hard nightmare quest true solo

I would like to talk for a moment about Gandalf's ability and other heroes contributing to the resource cost.  I have been playing it as in the video, but I admit that I had to read Gandalf's card a few times before I convinced myself that it was legal.  Even then I almost posted about it, but figured it would come up.  So I was right about that at least.

 

Can non-Gandalf heroes help pay the cost of cards being played by Gandalf if there is a resource match?  (I think so by a strict interpretation of the card.)

Hey Gwaihir! Just started watching your video, can't wait to finish it! First thing I wanted to ask you is what you are using for audio recording? Are you recording straight out of the camera?

 

No big deal if you are, because it's not like equipment comes cheaply. If you have the chance, I'd recommend picking up the Zoom H4N. It's relatively inexpensive, and you may be able to get it used!

 

It's a nifty little recorder and can only get better if you pick up other mics that can plug into the device, turning it into more of an equalizer.

 

Here's a link to the product on amazon!

Thanks for watching! And yes, I was just recording out of the camera, which I realize is not the best. I hope to have better results in the future without having to buy expensive equipment. So I apologize in advance for the audio. My Eagle vassals are hard at work to enhance the video and audio in the future.

What camera do you use? If you don't mind my asking. I agree to increase the quality so that the cards can be viewed better (which isn't really a point to my question). I was mostly just curious as to what camera you use? Sorry for the roundabout question lol

Ryodu, it is the camera on my MacBookPro. I use QuickTime to record. Nothing fancy.

I was just thinking the same thing :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

 

In fact when I saw this thread pop up near the top I got a little excited thinking maybe he'd be back but guess not lol.

He stopped. He got a second job and thus had to many wind under his wings. 

 

I also thought when I saw this thread again, that he was back, but sadly it is not the case.

Great work! I'm also glad to see a video with the physical cards.

 

It does take more time to play like this but I always found it more fun actually holding the cards instead of clicking buttons. Looking forward to watch the video after work.
