Hello Guys!

What is the situation in your countries with print on demand? Especially in Europe. Polish publisher talk over march 2017 its some problems. We don't have any scenarios and we have a specific situation with adventure pack (we have only in print on demand). Expansions are issued on the time. Exceptions were Fellowships.

Hi,

I'm from France and I'm having a really hard time finding the first POD quests and nightmare packs, it seems stores in Europe don't really stock them. I thought it might be because of the language since the nightmare quests are mostly released in English, but I can't even find them in the UK. It's strange because they have plenty of stock on US stores like miniature market, so I don't get why it's virtually impossible to find them in Europe. I'm tempted to make a massive order on a US store, but then I'd get murdered by custom fees so I'm not sure it's worth it !

Does anyone know if I'm missing some European website where the first PODs and nightmares are available ?

Cheers

I'm for France too. In French there is only a few POD. Most of the GenCon and fellowship but only cycle 1 and hobbit for nightmare. And since they were released many years ago they are out of stock now.

Stores rarely planed to keep a stock for a product. It is not how the business work. They are supposed to buy, sell it quickly and then make another order. And there is many problem about that with the POD:

- The french distributor (Asmodee since they control the whole system now) only sell the french product;

- Many product, but even more for the POD, stay for long in an out of stock process;

- Since they are adressed to a more expert population AND only in english POD are harder to sell than normal products.

 

So here is my advice timpwa if you want to have all: buy the recent stuff when they are online in French stores, try to get the french ones in France too but for the rest don't expect too much and order them in USA. There will be sending fees, and probably custom duties but this is the only way to get them. For the few I have seen UK have less nightmare in store than us.

Thanks for the advice, I guess I'll have to order them from the US.

Do you have any experience with customs when buying from the US ? I'll at least get the 20% VAT (ouch...), but since buying everything probably costs around 500$, there will probably be other fees from the customs.

Would you recommend buying them little by little instead ? Just curious if you have any feedback in general concerning customs, as these extra fees really weigh into the balance when considering if it's worth it. But then again if it's the only way...

thanks for any thoughts or feedback on the matter !

Nightmare packs was the only times I order from US. I have no idea what is the best way to avoid customs. But I don't think it issupposed to the at least 20%, it is more likely the difference between 20% and the US VAT.

US has no VAT

Spanish situation is as worse as it can get... we're still waiting for Nightmare Ringmaker cycle onwards. No LOTR saga nightmare except the first one.

Luckily we are somewhat updated with GenCon/fellowship decks, just lacking Attack on Dol Guldur.

I dunno who or what is causing that big delay or if Spanish sales are so bad that printing translations are on hold, but is a really frustrating situation.

Spanish have, as far as I know, the larger amount of nightmare (after english). So "as worse as it can get" seen not really accurate.

True, didn't read accurately your post...

It is still problematic to have so many delay. Even the second best situation could be not satisfying ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

I didn't have much problems getting them here in Slovakia, unless I wanted the newest Fellowship PoDs. I'm talking about English versions, because there are only three cycles translated in Czech (with no additional PoDs or saga expansions) and there are rumors that the publisher won't continue with the translation.

I'd say little by little. France's customs laws may differ a bit, but in Slovakia as an EU country we pay 20% VAT on every order worth more than 20€ and if above 150€, then an additional 3-11% customs tax as well. Check the customs office's rates and you'll see the exact numbers.

Thanks for the reply. I had a look and it's similar in France, we don't pay VAT for orders under 45€, so I'll make multiple small orders from the US
