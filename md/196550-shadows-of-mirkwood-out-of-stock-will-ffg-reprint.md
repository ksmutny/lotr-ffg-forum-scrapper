I'm in the UK and trying to get hold of the last couple of shadows of mirkwood cycle packs. Nowhere as far as I can tell in the UK has any, and hasn't for a while.

 

Does anyone know if FFG generally reprint things like this, or are they gone for good now, never to be seen again?

Yes, they always go through reprint cycles.

 

As of a few days ago, all the Mirkwood stuff was being sent to vendors...for the US at least. I don't know about the UK but reprints definitely do happen.

Yup as said above, already reprinted and being pushed out to distributors now :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
