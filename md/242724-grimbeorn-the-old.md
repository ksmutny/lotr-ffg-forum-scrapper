I see conflicting interpretation on grimbeorn the old in 2 players game.

Does he stay with the first player that put the 8e ressource on him for the rest of the game OR

Does he follow the first player token and change possession each round ?

Thanks

He will not switch players. Check out this [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59168-grimbeorn-the-old-and-first-player/] discussion about your question if you want to understand why.
