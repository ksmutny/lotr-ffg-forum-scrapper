Leadership is the only Sphere that can make a tournament-legal single-sphere deck with 2 Core sets.

Here's the breakdown with 2 Core sets (totals include Hero cards):

 * Leadership: 48.  (Needs 2 Gandalf cards to be legal)
 * Tactics: 44
 * Spirit / Lore: 45

Cards that need a third set for completion:

Leadership:

 * Celebrian's Stone (U)
 * Brok Ironfist (U)
 * Grim Resolve

Tactics:

 * Beorn (U)
 * Swift Strike
 * Stand Together
 * Horn of Gondor (U)

Spirit:

 * Dwarven Tomb
 * Fortune or Fate
 * Unexpected Courage

Lore:

 * Henamarth Riversong
 * Beorn's Hospitality
 * Dark Knowledge

So the only solution for a legal deck outside of Leadership is a double-sphere deck.

On another note, at 4 players, making double sphere decks gets real interesting because you can still only have double sphere decks if the 4th player plays a triple or 2 players play mirrored doubles.

Luckily, it seems the first adventure pack will be out not too far from now.

Just an FYI

Alas, heroes aren't part of your deck. You need a minimum of 50 cards in your player deck in addition to any heroes you use.

Even worse ha.  Either way, it won't matter in a few/couple weeks.  Still had a lot of fun playing 4-player single-sphere decks from 2 sets last night.  I've been getting some friends trained up and we basically rotate spheres so we get a good idea for how they play.  Loving that solo-sphere in 4-player.

Still seems like a small price to pay imho. I've spent more on my set of Jace: The Mind Sculptors than I'll likely need to spend for years on this game and all of its expansions.

And considering how fun this game is so far? Totally worth it.

I've bought 3 core sets at a total cost of $85.00. That's still less than a box of M:TG cards and I have all I need to put the deck maximum # of cards into a deck.

TL;DR - LCG > CCG wrt $$

Yeah. With two sets and the first AP you might end up with one tournament-legal deck for each sphere:

The first AP would have to include three cards for Tactics and two cards for each of the other Spheres.

Maybe I'll eventually get a second set - the price isn't too bad for 51 additional cards. But first I'd have to find someone to play regularly with, because solo play sucks (at least using a single deck).
