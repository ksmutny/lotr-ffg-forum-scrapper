And there is promise of some of the board products going digital too. How low are the odds of LotR LCG being digitalized? :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

If so OCTGN can expect a cease and desist letter in the future.

I'd say the chances are pretty low! I'd bet they start with the properties they own.

I'm guessing that the odds of FFG's LOTR contract covering electronic games is extremely low.

Considering how much effort Wizards puts into MTGO and how small the FFG manpower is...  lim(1/x) as x->inf.

I really like the work that FFG has been doing in this area, especially with Mansions of Madness 2.0, where they were pushing the boundaries between analog and digital games. I'm excited to see where they take that space from here.

It's possible that they'll produce digital versions of their LCGs, but I also wouldn't be surprised if that's not the real end goal here.
