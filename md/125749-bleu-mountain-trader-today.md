There are some months since he was released, and today he was still disscused around him. It is overpowered? Is it broken? Some people said so, and other people say not.

What do you think now? It should be errated? Do you have a broken deck with him? Is it really a lot of strong? Have you built a very strong deck with him?

 

After some time, do you continue thinking as at first? Have you changed of idea? Thanks for replies

He's good. If we're talking about resource arrangement - he's too good. Nuff said.

My thoughts have stayed about the same. When used appropriately his ability is definitely "overpowered" but if possible i would narrow that down to like trololo said, resource management.  I do not believe that was the intent of the designers as it completely takes away that essence of the game...that being said...in regards to playing and beating the scenarioes I dont think it's too bad.  While he can make things much easier for a multisphere deck I'm not sure his inclusion is going to save you from winning a quest you would have otherwise been defeated in (barring exceptions i'm sure).  In current play i only include him when playing other dwarfs or if I have space in a support deck.

He should say something like "Limit twice per round."

I myself don´t have that card so i haven´t any experience playing with this, to me he looks pretty normal ally.

Can someone tell me how this card is so overpowered? Right now i don´t get it why?

He's very powerful. In multiplayer, as long as any other player has 1 resource token left, he basically lets each player rearrange his resources in any way he likes. With Gandalf's ability, that's crazy.

If you only play solo, one-handed, he's a below average dwarf with some pointless text in his text box. Play multihanded or multiplayer...eek!

Wayyyyy to good ally must be errated. Maybe like divinity said "Limit twice per round"

He renders a large part of the multplayer aspect meaningless and its not even leadership. I dont know what the designers were thinking on this one... maybe they dont consider resource reallocation importqnt? In any case, the Trader makes songs and messengers pointless.

Exactly. Part of the challenge in LOTR is saving up enough of the right resources and knowing when to spend and on what. LOTR requires all resources to match the sphere of the card being played, so there is definitely some strategy required to be good at that aspect of the game (i.e., resource management). Blue Mountain Trader completely eliminates that consideration in multiplayer.

I kinda wonder if Blue Mountain Trader was fully intentional. Maybe the designers saw too many people playing solo and wanted to give people a reason to play multiplayer by granting this huge boon in multiplayer. They knew that people who don't need the card would skip over it, so it's also designed to grant weaker players some help. Obviously, I cant verify any of this, but I dont see an issue with it's existence since this is a coop game and we dont NEED to have the power cards to win.

I agree, that he is very powerfull...and that we need a limitation for his ability.

 

Once per round is to weak...he would become useless in my eyes.

 

But once per round per player could be good...so everybody could change 1 ress between 2 of their heroes.

(Or limit x times per round...x = number of players).

Isn't that how the "Once per round" is ruled at the moment. Each player could trigger a "once per round" effect .....

Just like "once per game" means each player could do it "once per game" eg. Landroval, Frodo, Aragorn (Lo). 

## 16 [-nebur- on October 29, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125749-bleu-mountain-trader-today/?do=findComment&comment=1315324)

I think "once per round" is different from "once per game"...(remembering that i read it somewhere).

 

If not, you could use Beravor, Bifur, Fatty, Eomer(!), Galadriel, Glorfindel, Grima(!), Haldir(!) and Imrahil multiple times per round by using Desperate Alliance.

 

And...don't forget the Beorn-Ally. :lol: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_laugh.png]

I see where you are going, but Beorn wouldn't work multiple times unless you also got

 

Ever Vigilant/Strength of Arms/Grim resolve/Brand/Merry

 

Despite it might work, it seems a pretty hard play to rely on....

## 19 [-nebur- on October 29, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125749-bleu-mountain-trader-today/?do=findComment&comment=1315337)

Beorn could attack only once...but with 13 Atk instead of 8...

(You use his action twice in combat phase...you only need the 2 new cards)

Once per round is per card. Once per game is different and per player.

So, you can't use Beravor, Bifur, Fatty, Eomer, Galadriel, Glorfindel, Grima, Haldir and Imrahil multiple times per round by using Desperate Alliance.

Is there any official ruling/info on those differences?

There was a lot of doubt because of a previous answer that was truncated and missread a lot.

Yes :

 

>  
> 
>  
> 
> Q: Since Nate answered that limit were "per player" it means that every other player can use Bifur's ability, Is that correct?
> A: Bifur’s once per round ability can only be triggered once per round, regardless of the number of players in the game or who controls him. Therefore, Bifur cannot gain more than 1 resource from his effect each round. The type of effects that can be triggered by each player that Nate was talking about in his answer were “per game” effects. He identifies that in his answer regarding Landrovals ability when he says: “Per Game” limits are not card specific… His answer needs to be taken as a whole, not just chopped down to: “Limits are player specific…”  He gave that answer in response to specific question about a “per game” limit. It should not be misconstrued to mean that every limit in the game is player specific. Effects with ‘per phase’ & ‘per round’ limit work as they are written.

For me, only playing in multiplayer, I just found me and my friends not willing to integrate it into decks. It is so sad to design such a bad and powerful card for multiplayer.

For me, a "once per round" (as a group) would still make him playable in dwarves decks as it enables other player to trigger faster the 5 dwarves threshold. Twice per round is already sickly overpowered ... As long as I am concerned.
