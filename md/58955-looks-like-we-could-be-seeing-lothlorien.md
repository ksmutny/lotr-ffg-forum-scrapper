on the slip with khazad it mentions dwarrowdelf and rivendell (which we know about) and lothlorien, .....so im guessingÂ  we actually are taking arwen from lorien to rivendell as in the appendices. so maybe we'll se some lorien characters early on

I had totally missed that! My god, I've only today taken delivery of Khazad-dum, and already I want to get going with the next cycle!

Well, the road goes ever on...

Well, I think you might be interpreting that wrong. It says, "Elves in Lothlorien and Rivendell grow concerned by the massing Orc threat." We have a gist of the theme for the Dwarrodelf expansions including their titles (thanks to the spanish and french sites) and there's nothing to imply we're GOING to Lothlorien. However, we are escorting Arwen from Lothlorien to Rivendell so there may be some Lothlorien elves that are going to show up as heroes or allies in the cycle. That would be my interpretation of the text.
