I couldn't find an answer to this question, but will the chapter packs for LotR contain 3 copies of each card or have they gone back to the original set up?

You will get one hero and three of each player card.

"Adventure Packs for The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game provide many new options for players.  Not only do they expand your available card pool, but they also introduce new quests to challenge your fellowship.  These fixed 60 card decks include a new Hero, three copies of nine unique player cards, and the Encounter and Quest cards devoted to the included scenario."

At a rate of 'only' 2-3 new cards per sphere per chapter pack, I can already feel the need for some large expansions coming up, just to give you some more options.

The way I see it right now, the chapter packs will be all about the included quest, and the larger expansions (hopefully about one each 6 months or after each chapter pack cycle) will hopefully focus on the player cards.
