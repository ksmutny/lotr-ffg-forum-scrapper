Well, thread title says it all so here are the threw questions I have...

1.  If an enemy engages you and is not defeated(it remains engaged to the next turn),  does its threat still count in the quest phase or is it no longer considered to be in the staging area?

2.  Is there a limit to the number of attachments that a hero can have on them?

3. Is there a limit to the number of ally cards that I can field along with my heroes?

1. Only enemies and locations in the staging area count their threat. If an enemy is engaged with a player or a location is active then those do NOT count their threat.

2. There is no general limit for attachments, but there is a limit for Restricted attachments. No character may have more than 2 Restricted attachments at one time.

3. There is no limit to the number of allies that can be in play at a time.

1. doesnt count while it remains engaged

2.no unless a card states so....only 2 of restricted attatchements on each hero are allowed

3. no unless a card is unique and has a circle beside its name, then only one in play at a time

Thanks for the quick replies.  Those were the answers I was hoping for(to stand a chance in solo play)!
