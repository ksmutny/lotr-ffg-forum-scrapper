# [What Faction are You? (yes...another richsabre poll!!)](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/92237-what-faction-are-you-yesanother-richsabre-poll/)

in warhammer and such games players often field one specific race or faction....orcs, elves, dwarves and so on.

 

ive noticed a few players say 'im mainly a lore player, or 'spirit player', but ive only seen a few recently say 'im a dwarf player' or 'im a ranger player'.

 

so what are you? obviously most of us switch, but is there any you mainly play, a lot more than others?

 

****or if you like....which is most frequently represented in your decks....(so we dont get all 'J' s)

 

please vote...hopefully all the options are there, including 'all of them equally' :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]  some will not get many votes as they havnt really been expanded yet, but i include them for the sake of completion.

 

those to come in future packs such as isengard havnt been included but can be if you want them

 

a) noldor

b) silvan

c) gondor

d) rohan

e) dale

f) dwarves

g) hobbits

h) rangers (i consider these seperate from gondor)

i) istari (i know there can only be 5 of them, but a lot of decks are based solely around them so i think hey should be here)

j) mostly equal throughout the race/factions

k) outlands (forgot about them!)

 

a-4

b-1

c-2

my vote goes for j- all of them. i go through 'race phases' . for a few months i will play dwarves, then when new packs come out i will often switch to them. at the moment its hobbits, and its likely to stay that way for a long time as ive waited since the start of the game to field hobbits.

 

if i were to chose order of how often i play what then it would be:

 

1.noldor

2.dwarves

3. hobbits

I think many will say J since I imagine many players cycle through the different factions, so this category might dilute your results. J would be my pick, but i don't wan't that to be my answer.

I'll take a slightly different twist to the question.

Which is; What faction is usually represented in many of the decks I construct?

Most of the decks I make are usually a mix of factions, but usually one faction seems to make it into many decks more than others, and that is Noldor. These results are skewed due to spirit Glorfindel and his bag of tricks, but other cards like Arwen, Master of the Forge, Rivendell Blade, Gildor, Erestor, Rivendell Minstrel, and Stargazer are great cards, and see alot of play without Glorfindel. Elrond decks are really powerful, and I have recently gotten into using the two brothers again.

So, Noldor cards see the most play and find their way into lots my decks.

I think that i'm probably technically J... as I do go through phases of trying different spheres and races. I'm not sure that the limited number of cards available for some races (Beorning, Dale, Silvan etc) makes deck building by race really viable for many... 

 

My default solo deck is primarily made up of A, B & C... heavily favoring Nordor cards (I would really like more Silvan & Nordor options)... and like Tracker1 do tend to include a number of Nordor cards in most decks I build.

 

 

1 - Noldor

2 - Silvan 

3 - Gondor 

 

BR isn't available yet in my country... otherwise Hobbits would have made the list in place of Gondor.

 

(Re warhammer & 40k; The Empire & High Elves,  Elder & Ultra Marines (though I don't play anymore).. there does seem to be a bit of a trend...)

My vote would have to be for 'A'.

 

Like i said in the Blood of Gondor thread, i'm mainly a Lore Elf/Ranger player. Most of my main deck is built around the Noldor trait and i can't wait for a Galadriel Hero so that i can finally build a crazy powerful Elrond, Galadriel and Glorfindel Noldor deck. But currently it consists of Elrond, Aragorn and Glorfindel.

 

The Ranger trait would definitely come in second along with the Silvan trait.

When I play solo, i mostly use noldor characters, Elrond, Glorfindel, Gildor, Stargazer, Arwen are among the ones I never let out. They are followed by creatures (but they are not included, i use a lot the eagles) gondor and rohan, but their row might change with theoden.

1. Noldor

2. Gondor

3. Rohan

Noldor and Rangers go well together. I often prioritise theme over using the best cards. Sometimes a dwarf or silvan finds its way in there as well.

thanks for voting everyone- noldor certainly has its fans....myself amongst them.

@olorin93 - which would you say you used more, noldor or rangers?

@rich - You know, I wasn't sure, so I went ahead and counted! My hero setup in this case is Elrond/Loragorn/Glorfindel FoS, so that's 2 Noldori (plural?) and one Ranger. As far as allies go in my standard deck, I have 3 Imladris Stargazer, 2 Master of the Forge, 2 Gildor Inglorion, 2 Arwen Undomiel, 2 Rivendell Minstrel and 1 Watcher of the Bruinen (though I should also have 1 Trollshaw Scout, no idea where that got to). For Rangers, I have 2 Northern Tracker, 1 Ithilien Tracker and 1 Ithilien Archer. Haldir and Henamarth are Silvan, and then there are some Gondorian healers and Gandalf cards.

 

So, in total: 12 Noldori allies (6 unique), 4 Rangers (3 unique) and 2 Silvan. Cards like Son of Arnor would be a great thematic fit, but I don't want to switch a hero, worry about getting Song of Kings or drawing Stargazer and Vilya before any Leadership cards. Is this similar to your build with these heroes (I seem to remember you said you've run the same ones)?

## 14 [richsabre on October 18, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/92237-what-faction-are-you-yesanother-richsabre-poll/?do=findComment&comment=891408)

yes, that is very similar to some i run, and a great choice in my opinion. usually its frodo instead of elrond, but if i want the extra ally playing power then elrond gets switched in. i also have pretty much the sam allies as they are the best around for noldor

 

i think its a great deck- have you had a lot of success with it?

With a deck nearly the same as Olorin93 (the major change is that I use either Loragorn or Denethor and I also include Haldir), I have won on first attempt all core set (except dol Guldur), all of Mirkwood cycle AP and all the Khazad Dum quest. Haven't tried it on the rest yet .  And this without the use of any Gandalf in. 

 

A great deck indeed and the one I love most for certain

Since I always wanted to try these two, but always thought that the discard thing was not the best option, are they really usefull ?

well tactics noldor allies are few, but fortunatly i think 3 copies of each of these in a deck is fine. the discarding can be problematic though, especially in a deck that every card has its function and place.

all the same i really like the two, and they combo well with a twins deck. i think its probably best in a high card drawing deck that can give you plenty of choice in what you discard- so foe hammer is key

I played a long time Noldor, but my favorite faction is Rohan - so I can not wait for some hero Rohan of Leadership. Theoden and Eomer are great, but so far I've played for 3 players (December join our group  fourth player), and one player in particular loves the sphere of tactics so they are reserved for him.
 
I look forward to the Voice of Isengard and I have secretly hope that the second Hero will be from the sphere of leadership.
Since in our group, that I create the decks for other players, I hope to created four great decks based on Rohan and Gondor. but it's possible that I would have to wait until the end of cycle Ring-maker.
 
I would also like to have enlarged faction Dunedain.

The pattern would suggest that there will be a lore hero for Rohan.

 

I'm big on Rohan. I experiment a lot with different decks, thematic or otherwise, but I return to Rohan all the time.

Rohan just reminds me of the Spartans from the movie 300 - as the Spartans went much smaller army against the might of Mordor, knowing, that it can will be their last battle and nobody it will not survive, and  yet, Theoden, not turned  from Gondor and decided to support him in defense Minas Tirith leading your people even for certain death.

yes, the elves, particularly the noldor, were the best warriors of middle earth. i think the heroes show this such as glorfindel and the twins, but so far the designers have concentrated on their knowledge and wisdom in the form of stargazer, master of the forge and erestor.

i hope that noldor are expanded even more

@rich - Yes, I've used this deck and won every scenario in the Core Set, Khazad-Dûm and Dwarrowdelf. Currently working my way through Shadows of Mirkwood with a second player. We might try Conflict at the Carrock this weekend, will certainly be a challenge! I sometimes tweak it a little - Landroval has gone in and out a few times, as well as extra Watchers of the Bruinen and Trollshaw Scouts. Recently added some trap cards for better staging area control. What I would like is improved card drawing and resource collection. One could always use Rivendell Minstrel to get hold of Song of Kings and then Steward or Gondor (or try and play it with Vilya). I'm also considering getting an extra core set just for the sake of Unexpected Courage and A Test of Will, as I've found no place online where TCG cards are sold separately, new or used - at least not to Europe. Is there one?

no i do not think so, even the ones in the US i have seen sell for far too high- you may as well get a 2nd core set. i got one last year after considering it since the game started. initially i didnt think it worth it but since i play a lot of 2 handed, its nice to even have extra copies of cards you get 3 copies in the core set

i would say its certainly worth it

I would love to be a Silvan player, but that's not really possible yet. 

 

Right now I'm a Ranger player. Lore is definitely my favorite sphere and I love the Ranger's ability to attack into the staging area. I'm just bummed that you can't play with Faramir on Blood of Gondor

This is tough for me to answer. I would probably have to say:

1. Outlands

2. Hobbits

3. Dwarves

 

But this is based on a few things: Firstly, I really really REALLY want to make a solid Gondor deck but I haven't been able to, so in my heart I am a Gondor player, but I just have never been able to live up to it.

 

The Outlands deck I made makes up for this, but it is practically unstoppable. I put them number one because I love the deck, it's semi-close to being my "Gondor" deck, and if I get frustrated on a quest I whip them out and smash it just to show myself that it's possible. But I kind of feel like using them is a little too easy so I tend to not use them on my first go-around in a quest. I'd rather lose 5 times as hobbits and then win with them than just breeze through as Outlands.

 

 I also really enjoyed playing as the dwarves through the Dwarrowdelf Cycle, but I've grown a bit bored of them and have moved more towards playing as the Hobbits as my primary deck.

My current deck, which I set up last Xmas to play Heirs of Numenor and have had set up all year, as I want to take it through the entire Against the Shadow cycle before I change it, is a Rohan-Gondor split, with a good dose of elves all the same. I think Rohan is the major faction though, so I'll say (d).

I haven't been able to play hardly at all over the last few months...  So if I had to answer this from the start of when I started the game when it released, the Dwarves would be high on my list...  But for a more "recent" lineup (and by recent, I mean I've only been able to do about play about 3 runs through BR since it released, and that's been it for the last few months for me) I've had the above three (not in that particular order).  I finally broke down and started playing double-handed, with a LDR/LORE Ranger'ish deck of Faramir, Coragorn, and Theodred combined with mono-Tactics (Legolas, Bard, Beregond).  For a 4-handed run with a couple friends, I added an all-Hobbit deck (Sam, Merry, Pippin) and a secrecy deck (Glorfindel + Beravor).  I am loving the Rangers, plain and simple.  Even though the traps were not as effective in BR, they will be gold in a majority of the regular AP's... and I see myself running Faramir regularly as a main for me in the future (would like to start creating some different combos of him and the Twins, Beravor, etc).

 

So Rangers/Dunedain head my current list (and are truthfully the "race" closest to my personality and love of play-style)

:

1) Rangers (Dunedain)

2) Gondor

3) Noldor

4) Hobbits

From a thematic view point I like playing with Silvans - more specifically the Lorien elves, though they have yet to be developed enough to make decent decks from (but that doesn't stop me trying!)

 

Also (again for theme) I love Eagles and Radagast.  So that would be "Creature" I think :-)

So many people like playing as Elves!  I have seldom made Elf-focused decks, so I need to do that more.

 

I myself enjoy my ongoing effort to create the perfect dual Gondor deck setup.  But in the end, my all time favorite faction to play as are the Dwarves.  They are so well rounded and it never becomes dull, especially when you have many Dwarves on the board.  I have yet to have all 13 of Thorin's Company in play at one time, but it is a continued goal of mine!
