Just got Conflict at the Carrock and noticed it has only 2 stages for the adventure. What caught my attention is that the second (and last) part of the adventure doesn't have any line stating how to win as all the previous ones had...

So I'm wondering if it should have 3 stages and I got a misspack, in wich case I need to know how to claim for the one I'm missing.

Is there any place to see full lists of all cards of each expansion?

Thanks,

Javier

Once you complete the second cards conditions you win. FFG just forgot to add the victory condition bit.

~hooray, this thread again!

 

Seriously, though, there are only 2 stages.  If you want to see a card list, you can try http://lotrlcg.com [http://lotrlcg.com]
