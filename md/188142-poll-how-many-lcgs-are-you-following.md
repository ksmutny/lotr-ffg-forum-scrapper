# [POLL - How many LCGs are you following?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/188142-poll-how-many-lcgs-are-you-following/)

## 1 [Julia on September 12, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/188142-poll-how-many-lcgs-are-you-following/?do=findComment&comment=1790453)

(sorry for cross-posting; if you've answered this already on a different board, please do not re-enter your data; I'll be keeping count of the results, and not of the name of the voters)

 

As per subject; it'd be interesting to see whether people tend to specialize (one or two games max) or to follow the scene in a wider way.

 

So, if you don't mind, list below the LCGs you're regularly following (no need to buy new packs as soon as they are out; let's say you have at least 70% of the existing material).

 

If enough answer, I could do some (possibly interesting) statistics

 

EDIT: I'll close the poll and collect the data on September, 25th.

Just this one, although I recently picked up the A:NR core set and most of the Genesis cycle.

 

(That L5R LCG that FFG just announced sound like it could be interesting as well... love that theme.)

Just the LotR LCG, and my two buddies too.

We each have all the content.

 

 

Oh wait: we also play Zombicide. Very fun coop board game.

But I don't own anything. I'm a scrub.

The new Black Plague box coming up looks great tho!

Set in medieval times, it's right up my alley! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

You defined "the following" by owning at least 70% of existing content. By that definiton I follow only LotR LCG. 

 

As for other LCGs I have some content of/play/actively spectate: CoC LCG, Android Netruneer, Game of Thrones 2nd ed. LCG.

Currently only follow LotR, but I plan to follow Game of Thrones 2.0.

Just LoTR, the cooperative aspect appeals to me way more than the competive games do.

Just LOTR LCG for me too (all deluxe boxes and APs, few PODs, no nightmare). If another solo friendly one emerged I would consider jumping on board though.

LotR only.

I tried to get into Cthulhu and Netrunner, but I have discovered that competitive games just don't have the same draw for me.

Just LOTR now.  I might follow AGoT2 if it ever releases.  5Rings is interesting too, but far away.

 

If there were a local Cthulhu meta I would be all over that.

LOTR mainly, but also 2 cores and a few expansions for Star Wars LCG. Both are great games

Just this one for me. Casual Magic with friends and theoccasional Hearthstone game are competitive enough for me.

Hmm

I am not yet going to enter data Julia because:

LotR and CoC following

But

Also have full WI and although it is discontinued, it is in print and until very recently when i completed it, it would have fit your description of following/buying.

Also, seriously thinking about Star Wars LCG

So do I answer 2,3 or 4??

I follow LOTR LCG, but I don't buy everything (70 % of everything, I guess). I play pure solo, and sometimes, some AP's have more multiplayer cards.

I also follow Marvel Legendary (100 % of everything), also play solo, but 2 handed.

 

Will in a while get Xenoshyft.

Just LotR.

 

Might be interested in others offered by FFG if they were co-op or somehow offered solo play.

 

Used to follow CoC (love the Lovecraft theme), but was unable to sustain significant other's interest in the game so dropped since it really doesn't lend itself to solo play. 

 

[update: regarding content: own 100% of non Nightmare and a handful of those as well]

Yeah, I play other games, but LOTR LCG is very addictive. I don't know why, exactly.

It's because the LCG is sort of like the movie trilogy: a combination of talent, high production values, solid craftsmanship, eagerness for a proper adaptation and love for an acknowledged intellectual property.

 

That art. Those mechanics. That theme. That co-op. That everything.

In addition to LOTR, I follow AGOT 2.0 and I have maybe 30% of existing Netrunner stuff.

Just LOTR for me, although I don't have 70% of the content. I've bought nearly everything that came out since I started playing the game.

I own LOTR LCG and plan on buying into AGOT 2.0

I play many other solo/coop games and wish that there was another coop LCG

At the moment, only LotR LCG. I would like to get into AGoT 2e, but the apparent lack of interest among my friends and in my area more generally means I may end up passing on AGoT 2e. 

 

EDIT: I don't believe I currently own 70% of everything released for LotR LCG, but plan to own everything in due time. I currently have everything (excluding Nightmare packs) up to the end of the AtS cycle (incl. Hobbit sagas, excl. LotR sagas), and half of the Ringmaker cycle.

Currently only LOTR. I am planning to get into AGOT 2 because my buddies are as well and they will help pay. However, we went to PAX and played some warhammer 40K and we were unexpectedly blown away by how fun it was and we may get into that as well. We have tried all the lcg and did not find the others that interesting (SW edge battles are uuuugh)

Only LOTR LCG. I don't own 70% of existing material, although if I continue to play the game it is reasonable to assume that I will eventually own everything.

Thanks guys :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] So far, it's the most active board in terms of answers given (I'll keep the poll open for 10 days, and then check the numbers)

 

A quick answer about the 70%: it's just a parameter to say "I'm following a game". If you started playing 6 months ago, and got 1 core and a handful of expansions, but you are active as players and plan on getting more, I'm fine if you select the game. It's very "easy math", no need for strict protocols to validate answers :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I only follow LotR LCG (I own everything so far minus a few stuff released at this year's Gen Con). I play mainly solo, so getting into a competitive LCG with no one else to play with is pointless for me. I do want to get into Legend of the 5 Rings LCG when it's available, but I need to convince some of my friends to jump when it releases in a few years from now.

Only Lotr also. I am trying to relive and re-find the beauty from Tolkines work through all possible media, whether its a game, a book or other. So for me its not one of my game hobbies. Its one of my Tolkien interests.

I also only currently play lotr lcg.  have maybe 70& of stuff.  I do have a copy of game of thrones core sitting on my shelf but I don't know whether I will take that up.  1 is already too much money.

Only Lord of the Rings.

 

I am interested in Netrunner and Cthulhu LCGs as well, but my current life arangements make non-solo play a very unusual option, so I can't justify the expense of them.

I follow Lotr (own everything) and SW lcg (own about 95%). However, I play Lotr purely solo mostly because I can't find a local play group. Sadly only played SW lcg twice due to lack of play group. You would think this would sway me to not get into ANR or GoT but I want them both....my wife would kill me though :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Just to add:

Cthulhu has two unofficial solo variants on BGG that are well respected.

Star Wars also has a solo variant on BGG that gets high praise too.

So folks liking the look of them without opponents, have a looky.

Julia one thing to think on: FFG forums seem the most active place for chatter on LotR but other games have busier forums elsewhere (eg cardgamedb for CoC and SW with BGG getting traffic and Im sure the other games will have places too).

So FFG isnt an exact spread across the player base of most games, only the ones where here is the main busy hub (such as LotR).

Not sure how this affects your results or if you considered pulling other forums into your catchment but I thought I would mention it anyway for your consideration.

I collected Star Wars for a while, but haven't picked up anything new for it since the Rogue Squadron block started. It's still a fun game, but LotR is nice since I can play it anytime without needing another player. Even with more players, I love the cooperative and narrative style of game play from LotR.

 

Not LCGs, but for other FFG games I've played, I really enjoy XCOM and Elder Signs, again for the solo/cooperative play, though XCOM is a little overwhelming when you're alone!

I'm "just" buying into the LotR LCG - but, by estimation, I've spent thousands on this game by now so I do feel like a faithful customer. It really is the theme, cooperative aspect and gorgeous art that sell it for me.

Thanks Alex, I'm aware of that. But considering I'm doing this just for fun (I have not been asked to do this), and that I frequent mostly only FFG boards, creating accounts on other boards and all the rest seems a little bit beyond the purpose of this question, I think. If anyone here is active on cardgames.db or other similar domains and wants to extend the question to his/her fellow forumites, they are more than welcome to do so, and we can work out the results by email

Lord of the Rings and Star Wars LCG for me.  I also have some content for Game of Thrones (1st Editition), and I own the core set for Conquest and Invasion, but I don't plan on expanding those collections at this point. I also own X-Wing, Diskwars, and Armada collections outside of the LCG format. 

 

I have found that owning all of a game is expensive and limits your purchasing power, but it is possible to own parts of many games.  I have four brothers who also play these games, so between us we slowly buy up different parts of each and do plenty of swapping.  It works well, as we have access to and ownership of many (nearly complete) games but only pay the price of a few individually.  It is still expensive, though.

Largely pointless. Source: I teach statistics at a university.

 

Fun and interesting, no doubt. But, the sample is insanely biased. 

 

All of your results can only generalize to:

 

1) People who check FFG forums

2) People who saw these posts

3) People who chose to respond to these threads

 

No doubt FFG has TONS and TONS of people who follow its games and don't reliably check these boards. 

 

However, three cheers for anything to do with statistics. Send me a message if you want to chat.

As said, it's done with the mere purpose of have a general idea. It's not a marketing research, and it has not the intent of collecting a representative sample of the whole population playing LCGs. I write mostly on FFG boards, and I'm interested in having a general taste of what my fellow forumites do / collect / play, that's all.
