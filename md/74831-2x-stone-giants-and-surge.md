If I have 2 stone giants in the staging area, and the boulder card that they give surge comes into play, does the surge trigger twice, adding two additional cards into the staging area? Or does this not stack, and only 1 card is added?

 

Thanks

if i remember rightly, the card says 'while there is at least 1 stone giant….' so i think this means 1 surge

rich is correct. The Stone Giants are worded such that the Galloping Boulders card will only surge once. The surge keyword IS cumulative, but the Stone Giants do not create a stack of surge triggers.

Just one surge.
