I'm making a female hero deck based off of the Core and the Shadow of Mirkwoods adventure pack cycle. I don't have the other expansions yet. I was trying to look for a list of female heroes, but can't find any. Can someone provide me with a list of female heroes currrent in LORD: TCG? Thanks!

Tactics Eowyn, we still want ya!

Although now that we have the Eowyn+Herugrim combination that works so well, perhaps our chances of seeing another version of Eowyn are decreased...

Eowyn+Herugrim plus Galadriel with Nenya .. who need tactics anymore! :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

... or Lay of Nimrodel or Elrond Council or Astonishing Speed or Courage Awakend ...

With the imbalance in the male/female heroes I'm surprised an Arwen hero hasn't been more forthcoming.

Thanks everyone! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

Hopefully there will be more female heroes in the future. I am having lots of fun with the game and hoping to collect all of the expansions.
