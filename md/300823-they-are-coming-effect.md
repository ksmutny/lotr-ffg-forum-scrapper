Hi guys

Do you discard They are coming! card before shuffle the discard pile into the encounter deck?

Doomed 2.  

When Revealed: Shuffle the encounter discard pile into the encounter deck and discard cards from the top of the encounter deck until X enemies are discarded.

Thanks

Nope! Treacheries and Events will stay in play (in sort of a limbo state, like a waiting area) until their effects are resolved as close to fulfillment as possible. Then they are discarded. Hope that helps! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
