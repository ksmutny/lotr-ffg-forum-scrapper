I'm pretty sure the balrog attacks twice per turn correct? On doom doom doom it has the forced effect that the balrog makes an attack if it's in play at the end of the quest phase. On the balrog card itself it says while in the staging area the balrog is considered to be engaged with the first player. So that means it would attack during the combat phase as well right?

I only play solo one handed and if I played this right (he attacks twice per turn) , I'm finding this really hard! Thanks

Yep, correct. He is a beast.

Well, technically he's an angelical being, seduced by Melkor in the days before the making of Arda. But I doubt you'll care when he's kicking your ass. ^^

Well, technically, he sure ain't no angelic being. Tolkien always restrained himself from using terms like Devil or Angel for he did not want to make the connection with the Bible to obvious. (juat heard thia from the Tolkien Professor in his Silmarillion Seminars, certainly a superb thing, I advise it! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] )

Also, they were not really seduced, but rather already part of the rebellion of Melkor against Illuvatar in the beginning, with the Music. So, those Ainu were already evil in a way and when they came to Arda joined Melkor. It is true that he gave them their form. And if you look to certain games like Might amd Magic V, those angelic creatures look a lot like 'good' Balrogs. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Cool, I didn't know that Melkor was planning a rebellion beforehand. I just thought he grew so enamoured with his own voice he tried to persway others to sing his tune.  Oh well, at any rate, dr. funkaflex balrog still kicking our asses :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Well, that´s not really what I meant. They indeed turned their voices to Melkors voice when he ´rebelled´,aka trying to make his part more important than the rest, against Illuvatar. That was the rebellion I was pointing at.

No, they're 'sound' only, some sort of podcast serie. Here's a link: http://www.tolkienprofessor.com/wp/lectures/courses/silmarillion-seminar/  [http://www.tolkienprofessor.com/wp/lectures/courses/silmarillion-seminar/]

 

There are also seminars for all LOTR books, the Hobbit and Unfinished Tales. I found them quite the blast, really interesting!
