Hi guys,

I just want to share about an online store called bookdepository.com. I bought my Core Set and a couple of Adventure Packs from them, and so far I find their pricing very competitive due to their worldwide free shipping policy.

I live in Indonesia, and buying from an online shop with free shipping is always good. Hope this info help fellow players from non-US/EU countries :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I received my items between 14-18 days after they're shipped.

this place it goods I order form there now and then but they have limited stock of stuff and often run out.. I think they have already run out of Kaz as I can not find the item on the store. This is a good place to get things but it is unreliable. I find BP is best for getting older items.. like say you want to grab a hunt for gollum now for example.
