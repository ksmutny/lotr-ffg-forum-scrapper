Has anyone considered this as a good idea? In addition to the satisfaction of succeeding at a Quest, I REALLY wish there was something more afterwards, maybe just a little more than...you win! I'm not sure if I'm in the minority here. I believe there are more people who play this game strictly for the card game, win or lose mechanic the competition, as opposed to a neat on going storyline.

On the flip side of things, I'm sure the primary counter to my desire for somekind of ending to each quest is, well, the epilogue of the quest you just played, is the beginning of the next quest. Would you guys agree?

Or, are there other like me who think it woldn't hurt to maybe just one more card to the quest deck, or a short paragraph to read after the quest, like there is a short one during set up? I love the fluff...guilty.

To be honest, I've never even thought about it. But I'm not big into the fluff. I just play the game to win or lose, though I do enjoy it greatly.

Sounds like an interesting idea.  I like the game also to have more storytelling/immersion.  So epilogue card might be something worth looking into.  Although that would use up 1 card (which might be better used for encounter deck or player card).  The epilogue could appear on the next Adventure Pack (well, that would be a prologue then for that pack).  Or better yet, instead of an epilogue card, maybe just an epilogue that players could read here on FFG.  Maybe that epilogue would have different endings, depending on what happened in your quest.  Did you lose a hero in the process? Your epilogue is this. Did you get that victory point from this X card? Then go to this webpage and read your epilogue.

 That would be another advantage of an online CCG. Players could unlock cards by beating scenarios. I would certianly add to the storytelling aspect of the game.

 I like the idea of bringing in more story to the game and having the end of a scenario feel more final by having flavor text describe what was accomplished.  At the very least have more story put into the included sheet that has the info for on the quest.  I mean this is

Sorry, my iPad went weird on me.  Anyway, what I was going to say is the game is based on novels that are renowned for having very rich characters and deep story.   The game isn't based off some hack and slash story.

 it's a nice idea - Ninjadorg's custom scenario's have prologue and epilogue cards.

I guess the main issue, as someone said, is that it would be another card used up out of the pack. We already get lots of moans on here about the rate at which new player cards are brought out, this would only slow things down even more.

I'm a huge fan of Ninjadorg's projects. I'm trying to lure him into attempting a feat like this, perhaps if anything, individuals can produces their own text cards via Artscow.

 I think it's a fun idea. I like some fluff in a game like this, but only in moderation. A single card would be a nice touch.

 You could even include a mechanic aspect on "epilogue cards" relating to Nightmare campaigns. For example, a victory mechanic for Journey to Rhosgobel could be that you keep Wilydor as an ally in your next scenario (but with three health).
