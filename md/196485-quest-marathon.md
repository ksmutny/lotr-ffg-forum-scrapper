So some of you might remember that I did this same thing last year.  I played through all the quests I own and showed the scores.  Now all of you might not have half as much extra time as I do over the holidays so it shouldn't be expected of you to do all the quests, but if you could play four or five a week, maybe finishing two cycles of your choice before new years, that would be great.  Rules are you must do it with one deck.  keep your score if you want so you can have something to compare with everyone else.  I, at least will put the following things:

1:The heroes I used will go at the top due to the fact that they wont change.

2: I will list the name of the quest

3: Under which I will put whether I met defeat or victory.

4: Next I will put my score

5: and lastly, I will rate the chalenge of the particular playthrough in the following way:

sandbox = I could have done this in my sleep

easy = this was not very chalenging

moderate = I had to take some risks and was chalenged but I ended up with a win

hard = This was quite a chalenge and I either met victory or defeat by an inch

brutal = This was a nightmare and I never really had a great chance.

 

So yah!  Join me if you want.  I am playing it with my brother so you can do multiplayer two!  Remember that you should only do each quest ONCE!  no restarts!  I will post what Ive done so far when I have more time.

 

The other thing is that one can post the total score per cycle, including the deluxe expansion.  we will compare the different decks through the total scores of the different cycles.  If you want to join the marathon, hurry up cause you've only got till midnight on newyears eve!
