Hey, i was just wondering on a rule concerning surge. When you reveal a card from the Underworld deck that has surge, are just deal a card from the encounter deck right? I'm assuming so, but just wanted to make sure. Thanks.

Whoops, my bad. The card wasn't supposed to be in there, I got some of the symbols mixed up. Thanks anyways rich. =)
