Hi folks Recently got Watcher in the Water (yes I know, slowly catching up).Searched the forums for an answer but couldn't find anything about what happens if the character with a tentacle attached dies? I've been playing it that the tentacle just remains engaged with you and able to attack again, rather than return it to the staging area (or even better discard it!).I'm also assuming that whilst a tentacle is attched to a character it doesn't attack anymore.Is this right?Thanks for your patience.Cheers

I think you're referring to the situation where Grasping Tentacle becomes an attachment? If so, when the attached characters is destroyed, the attachment would return to its owner's discard pile: in this case the encounter discard pile. Hope that helps!

Ok thanks, I've been keeping the tentacle engaged with me. Discarding it makes life easier! Thanks for your help

Does the Grasping tentacle (after being attached) still being engaged and keeping attacking you?

 

I believe not, but…

I don't think so either, that's how I've been playing it. It just nullifies the attack and defence stats for tha character you attach it to. I just wasn't sure what happened if that character dies.
