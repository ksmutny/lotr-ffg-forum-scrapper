I don't know, maybe it's my graphical design education torturing me, but sometimes the way card text situated on the card just drives me insane...

 

Just look at this as an example:

Why the first line is aborted so early? Why the second line goes so far if the first line is so short? Both cases could be easily avoided! The text postion seems torn down.

 

I did research, and I found out that the whole situation wasn't even called for, it could have been easily texted as printed without any early paragraphs:

See? The text is solid, and fits perfectly, while taking the same number of lines!

Yeah, that's fair. I also try to make the best use of space when making my custom cards.

Welp, now I'll never be able to unsee that.

Yep, that's a good
point.

That was a waste of time. FFG has a set text box length which is slightly skinnier than yours. Why bother making an exception to that width for a single card when there's still plenty of vertical space?

Because aesthetics? And what do you mean by the waste of time? I can't quite place what it addresses exactly.

 

Update. It didn't took me long to find a proof of you being wrong on the whole "slightly skinnier text box length and bothering to make an exception" thing:

Mostly I was just saying that it seems like a waste of time to bring this up and create your own version of the card to fix it. It may also be a waste of time for the card designers to keep an eye out for these things all the time in order to make minor tweaks, especially since the text fits on the card just fine.

Doesn't seems like a waste to me. I work with that kind of stuff as my main job, including visual aesthetics and readability, and I have keen eye for that kind of stuff. It really bugs me, especially when it could have been done right so easily. I created my version not to fix it, but to show how easily it could have been done properly to explain my confusion regarding the matter why it wasn't.

I see. Maybe you should apply to work for FFG :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Thanks John.   Now it can't be unseen.
