 Hey all. I was just hoping someone could enlighten me as to how you handle an attack when the defender is discarded due to a shadow card effect. I had it happen once today while playing Redhorn Gate where Snowstorm was dealt as a shadow card, and my defending ally was discarded. Is the attack considered resolved, or does this attack go against other heroes/allies? Also, do I have a chance to defend with these other characters if in fact the attack redirects? Just hoping someone can clarify for me. It's never come up for me until today, but there's a good chance if affected the outcome of my game.

if an ally gets discarded when defending- the attack is considered undefended and thus needs to be converted to damage and placed on a hero

also you're lucky if youve managed with not encountering this till now- its a pain and you feel all the more lucky for hasty stoke and likewise

 Argh. Yeah, that changes today's win to a loss. Lol. Up until now the only time it happen was with Sudden Pitfall, but it killed off my last hero anyways so I never had to deal with what to do with the enemies remaining attack. Jeesh, that's rough. Anyway, thanks for the quick answer!aplauso.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/aplauso.gif]

Just to confirm what I already think I know but the same is true if a shadow cards deals damage that results in kills the defending character that attack is now considered undefended correct?

the general idea is yes that if a card for some reason of a card effect disappears then it becomes undefended, same gose for being removed fomr the questing phase.

There are a bunch of exceptions to this rule thou and there is no rym or reason to why... you just need to learn these excpetions. Like Sons of Anor and Wandering Took for example.

yes, correct me if im wrong- they both refer to two player scenarios- moving cards from player to player.........i cant think of any single player scenarios that would cause an execption?

Does this mean that a defender who dies during an attack from an enemy does not absorb the damage from the attack but instead passes that damage on to other heroes?

If he dies before the attack is resolved ( shadow effect that deals damage or something similar ) the attack goes undefended.
