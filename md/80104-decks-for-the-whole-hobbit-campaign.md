Finally got my copy og "On The Doorstep" this morning (takes a while to get to England), so this evening I'm planning to try the whole hobbit saga (and I'll probably include Laketown as well).

Has anyone tried this already? I haven't yet constructed decks for this yet, does anyone have any deck designs/card ideas that worked well for them playing through the saga?
