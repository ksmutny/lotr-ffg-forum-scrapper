So I have recently been kinda bored with the Khazad-Dum story.  Its gotten a bit old to me.  So I decided to change it to make the quests more fun.  I play the three quests all in a row (Still Reset Threat and all that) and call it “Cave Troll Hunt”.   This is how it works. 

 

While talking to a thug in a Tavern in the local city, you wind up in a fight with him.  He beats you up easily and says that next time you won’t escape with your life.  He tells you that if you can kill a Cave Troll and bring him the teeth for his collection, then he will not bother you again.  You quickly accept the bet, pack a bag and grab a few close friends and set off for The Mines of Moria to see if you can take down a Cave Troll.  

 

Then you start with the first quest “Into the Pit” and the dying Goblin tells you that a Cave Troll can be found at the Seventh Level.  You start your search there. 

 

So then you can either go through the Seventh Level Quest and find and kill a troll there or you can find one in Flight from Moria.  It’s a bit harder since you sometimes have to stall to find a cave troll.  I usually like getting the one in Flight from Moria.  I don’t know…..this is prob nonsense.  But I found it to be kinda fun and bring a little life back into Khazad-Dum.  You could do a nightmare mode were you have to find like 2-3 Trolls or something.  Maybe somebody will think this is kinda cool maybe not. Just thought I’d put it out there since I’m a bit bored.
