 Hi!  We've had a couple of occasions when slick footing has come out during questing and there were no active locations or any in the staging area.  Is it simply discarded then?  That's what we did because it said location and I take it that it does not apply to the quest card.  Thanks!

 Yep!  If there aren't any locations in play, don't go around looking for things to apply the card to - quest cards aren't locations.

 Thanks!  Appreciate it!

Don't forget that if no locations are in the staging area, the first Treachery each turn gains surge.

I looked everywhere in the rules but did not find this. Am I mistaken?

It's on the Emyn Muil quest card:

"Forced: If there are no location cards in the staging area, the first treachery card revealed during the quest phase gains surge."

Ah, ok, thanks! I thought this was a basic rule!

 It was the treachery cards on the last game that did us in.  Solo I haven't won yet, as a duo with my youngest son, we won without too much problem, but as three, (both older sons) we had way more victory points than we needed, way more tokens on the quest than we needed, but we couldn't get all the emyn muil locations out of the staging area before eventually we started getting picked off by all the treachery cards.  Once both boys went out, I couldn't handle the accumulated threat and what looked like a sure win was a devastating loss!
