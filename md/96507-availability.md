We're new to the game- got it for Christmas for my son. We have played it every night since!

I was looking for adventure packs, but it seems the early ones are rare, listed for $85+ on Amazon or eBay. I finally found a single copy of Hunt for Gollum at a local store. Is there a reason these are becoming rare? Does this normally happen between production runs?

Appreciate your feedback!

You nailed it with the last sentence, they do re-prints of the older sets but in between those times they see an escalation of price.  Just checked amazon though and saw all of the first cycle available for 12-20 bucks per AP.

Phew...  I was worried that I just got into a dying game! 

 

I'll run down and give my local shop a little more love since they have the first three, and they still seem to be pretty expensive online.

 

Already ordered the first Hobbit expansion, since my boy is obsessed with the movie right now, but it's still on back-order.

 

Thanks for your help.

Thanks for that  -  what does "Updated" mean?  Does that just mean that the release date is updated, or that the cards will change?  Glad for your help.

## 6 [Dedalus on January 8, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96507-availability/?do=findComment&comment=949064)

I think that the cards will have updated card text from FAQ's. Or, maybe I am wrong.

just that the release date is updated.

 

so far, very few reprints have had "updated" text.

## 8 [camacazio on January 8, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96507-availability/?do=findComment&comment=949102)

Updated means that the encounter cards will be numbered, and possibly in this new run, the "hard" encounter cards to be removed for easy mode are marked.

@Dain Ironfoot Thank you for updating my noobism  :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

> Interesting. Thanks

that's not to say this round of reprinting won't have the errata, but so far, only 3 cards have been reprinted with updated text (all from the core - but not all core cards have been updated).

## 12 [Style75 on January 8, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96507-availability/?do=findComment&comment=949183)

I wouldn't worry about this being a "dying game". The CEO of the company announced at Gen Con that this game was the company's unsung hero and was doing very well. I think this is reflected in the number of new releases we're seeing: New deluxe expansion with a full AP cycle, new saga expansions based on the novels, and new print on demand nightmare decks, and POD gen con adventures. Furthermore, the production values keep going up with highly improved art and product inserts. The general feeling around this game is that it is receiving a lot of attention and TLC from FFG and it has a good future ahead of it. I think it's a great time to get into the game.

 

If you're struggling to find adventure packs, keep checking the FFG online store [http://store.fantasyflightgames.com/showproducts.cfm?FullCat=248]. They sell for set prices (no markup) and are available if there is any stock to be had (ie- not currently out of print). FFG has consistently said that this game will be "evergreen" and reprints will be of sold out products. I certainly would not pay the inflated prices some stores are asking, just wait a few months until the reprints are available.

## 13 [Karlson on January 8, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96507-availability/?do=findComment&comment=949291)

I ran into this exact same problem when I first begun collecting the game last Summer.  The Shadows of Mirkwood Cycle was impossible to find anywhere.  I distinctly remember really wanted the Tactics Boromir hero from the Dead Marshes pack and the only one I could find was $45 on eBay.  Just ridiculous.  

 

I soon realized that Fantasy Flight Games does do continual reprints of (most) of their board and card games, though.  So, hang in there; if you're anything like me, you'll want to collect the game and enjoy it a.s.a.p. and waiting for the reprints can be hard, but once they do reprint them, check out www.CoolStuffInc.com [http://www.coolstuffinc.com] or www.MiniatureMarket.com [http://www.miniaturemarket.com].  I have found that those two gaming stores have the best prices on the internet for the Lord of the Rings LCG expansions.

 

Good Luck!

Master of Lore and Blocking Wargs have updated text as of August 2013.

Welcome to the game! Hope you sort it out. The game will be more fun when you get new APs and expansions and your card pool expands. Some of the best heroes and allies are in the Shadows of Mirkwood and Dwarrowdelf adventure packs.

## 16 [Jose-san on January 9, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96507-availability/?do=findComment&comment=949803)

Good to know. I'm new to the game too and I was wondering just this.

Thank you for the info and welcomes!  This is an awesome community.

 

Good to know that the product is still expanding and "getting some love."

 

I'm keeping an eye on online stores, but will try to give my local shop as much business as I can - they are charging $14.99 for AP's (which seems to be totaly fair) and I want to make sure they continue to stock them.

 

From what I've gathered, it seems to be a good plan to play through the Mirkwood series - and I already have the Hobbit set on order since my son is a dwarf nut. Any thought on Khazad-dûm? They had that one stocked for $29.

 

Thanks again for the helpful, welcoming comments.

## 18 [Thanatopsis on January 11, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96507-availability/?do=findComment&comment=951796)

MSRP (in USD)

Core: $39.95

AP's: $14.95

Deluxe: $29.95

Saga: $29.95

 

So, yeah, the prices you are seeing are fair.  If your budget it tight, you can find them cheaper.

 

Khazad-dum (and the Dwarowdelf cycle) have some fan favorite cards and quests: Foundations of Stone and The Watcher in the Water rise to the top of most lists. Plus, since your son likes dwarves, there are a bunch of good cards for those types of decks across the whole cycle.

Nice - thanks for the tips!  

 

I'm sure that I'll get Khazad-dûm pretty soon...  at the rate we're buying up expansions (one a week), we'll be through Mirkwood soon.

 

Ive got to admit, we're thoroughly addicted. 

## 20 [faith_star83 on January 14, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96507-availability/?do=findComment&comment=953926)

According to FFG's upcoming site, Khazad-Dûm's reprints should arrive in January 2014...any day now :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

## 21 [camacazio on January 17, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96507-availability/?do=findComment&comment=956334)

Your local game store also often will have the adventure packs whether they are readily available online or not.

> Your local game store also often will have the adventure packs whether they are readily available online or not.

Unless you live in a small town that doesn't have a local game store (like me!)... 

## 23 [FreddieG on January 17, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96507-availability/?do=findComment&comment=956771)

Yeah, I was really surprised to find that a shop that carried the sets here as this town is no metropolis.

They actually had the entire Mirkwood cycle, so I've gotten Hunt for Gollum and Conflict at the Carrock. I'll swing down and get Rosgobel tonight likely.

 

Our first pass through "Corrock," we won without any margin: I "threated out", my son was able to take my remaining trolls, but didnt have enough willpower to combat the massing location threats in the staging area for more than one turn. With just enough avialble attack points, to the number, he slayed the trolls.

 

Then, the next two days, we were severly beaten twice in a row!    Love this game!

 

I finally played with a mix deck, and with the right combo of cards, we managed a solid win even with a few "Sacks" ("Forrest Snare" is one of my new favorite cards).

 

Looking forward to finishing out the cycle - and my first Hobbit expansion should be here this month.
