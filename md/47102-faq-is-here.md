Nice to see them get this out in fairly short order.

I looks like the crafty Nazgul has found a way to avoid rope traps.

## 3 [DrNate on May 20, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47102-faq-is-here/?do=findComment&comment=472015)

Yeah, the Nazgul no longer falls for my big hole with leaves on top of it. I thought it was a pretty clever hole, myself.

Meanwhile, the clarification section says that "When a card effect removes progress tokens from a quest card, the effect applies specifically to the quest card, and never to the active location." So, does that only mean cards that remove progress tokens from the "quest card" or do ones that just say "quest" count too?

I hope these rulings and errata aren't short sighted but take the long term into account, I'd like it if they stuck around and didn't suddenly get reversed as soon as another set or two are released.

## 4 [sortylege on May 20, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47102-faq-is-here/?do=findComment&comment=472024)

So, accoding to the official FAQ, something now is clear:

 * "Surge, Doomed, and Guarded keywords should be resolved any time the card on which they occur enters play, including during setup"
 * "If a player uses card effects to declare multiple defenders against a single enemy attack, the defending player must assign all damage from that attack to a single defending character."
 * "A player commits all characters he wishes to commit to a quest at once. Responses to the characters committing (such as those on Aragorn and Theodred) can then be triggered in the order of that player’s choice."
 * Chieftan Ufthak gets 1 resource token soon after attack declaration, so his first attack is 5, second is 7...
 * Dol Guldur Beastmaster gets and resolve 2 shadow cards every time he attacks, instead of only one.

but something isn't so clear:

 * "When a card effect removes progress tokens from a QUEST CARD, the effect applies specifically to the quest card, and never to the active location."

This rule applies only to Despair treachery card (remove from current "quest card") or to Misty Mountain Goblins too (remove from "current quest")?

So basicaly, Chieftain Ufthak does attack with 5 already on turn one ?! Ouch!

Also, since they already talk about the Orc Guards they could have mentioned where to but the card after it's defeated...although I'm quite sure it's the discard pile.

## 6 [Mestrahd on May 20, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47102-faq-is-here/?do=findComment&comment=472030)

I found the bit about committing to the quest interesting. It really nerfs Theodred. It says the first player commits his characters to the quest and resolves any triggers, then the next player commits. So, if Theodred is with the first player, he can't "spread the wealth" so to speak.

## 7 [TheLightdarker on May 20, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47102-faq-is-here/?do=findComment&comment=472032)

@Sorty

The rulebook seems to use "quest" and "quest card" pretty interchangeably.

For example, on page 14, regarding quest resolution, "If the Willpower is higher, the players have successfully quested, and they make progress on the quest.  A number of progress tokens equal to the amount by which their Willpower overcame the Threat are placed on the current quest card.  Note that if there is an active location (see page 15), progress tokens are placed on that location until it is explored, and the remainder are placed on the current quest."

In the case of Despair and Misty Mountain Goblins, according to the FAQ it seems fairly clear to me that you would remove the progress tokens from the current quest card.

@Mestrahd

Oh, boo! I completely missed that point that you made when I first read the FAQ, that does really hurt Theodred's usefulness. :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

## 8 [Narsil0420 on May 20, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47102-faq-is-here/?do=findComment&comment=472055)

In regards to Theodred: even so, it would depend on who the first player is... But I see this a a positive thing and mainly meant to address the timing of Aragorn and Theodred, so that you can still use Aragorn's ability even if he doesn't start with a resource on him. In any case, I'm still going to allow myself to give Theodred's resource to another player, it just makes sense to me.

## 9 [Paul Grogan on May 21, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47102-faq-is-here/?do=findComment&comment=472083)

I think they'll find the game needs a lot more FAQ.  Have they read these forums?

So based on the ruling that "after" actually means "when", this means that the Wargs simply declare themselves as an attacker and then run back to the staging area.  Useless wolves

## 10 [judas43 on May 21, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47102-faq-is-here/?do=findComment&comment=472117)

"Damage and Multiple Defenders

If a player uses card effects to declare multiple 
defenders against a single enemy attack, the defending 
player must assign all damage from that attack to a 
single defending character."
 
And what about the defense values? Are they added up?
 
The changes to Thalin and the keywords are somewhat strange. Does Doomed resolve on enemies that are instantly killed by Thalin? Why do those Encounter Keywords resolve each time they are revealed? And do they really resolve when the card enters play as a shadow card (by the wording in the FAQ: yes...)?
 
Based on the number of questions on the official and on the german board, I'm quite disappointed by this FAQ.
 
Let's hope FAQ 1.1 is already beiing worked on...

judas42 said:

No, of course not. They wrote this because many players, me too, ignored such keywords in the quest-setup-phase. Then you have to resolve them now. That doesn't affect the way shadowcards work: ONLY if the have the matching symbol you have to resolve shadow-cards.

Absolutely not.  The FAQ only speak about Ukthak and Beastmaster. The Wargs attack and after the attack is resolved, they return to staging area if no shadow effect has appeared, so they get "fast attack and retreat" behaviour. Very thematically.

## 13 [Mestrahd on May 21, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47102-faq-is-here/?do=findComment&comment=472141)

I also notice they did not address Legolas/Blade. But you can infer from the Despair answer that they only add counters to the quest card and never the active location.

Mestrahd said:

Don't think so. IMO, the FAQ just clarifies that locations work as one-way buffers to the quest: you need to go through them to make progress, but they don't protect against progress thieves. So a Legolas/Blade kill would still work on the location first.

 

## 15 [lleimmoen on May 21, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47102-faq-is-here/?do=findComment&comment=472175)

I wonder about the Nazgul thing. What the hell has happened? Haven't they had all the time in the world to get the text on the card? Or have they realized only just too late how powerful Forest Snare is?

I myself am not much inclined to do stuff that is not written on cards or in the rulebook...

I think they realized that later.Even with one core set the Nazgul comes later in the quest and after you first try you know wen you must use forest snear so you have several rounds to draw a forest snear(especialy with Beravor) and keep it for the Nazgul.So this makes the bigest threat and the nastier enemy of the quest not a big deal for the players and after you can survive the first quest card then the game becomes realy easy if you can ignore the Nazgul with forest snare.

Also thematicaly is a little funny if you could catch a Nazgul with a ropelengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif].

Whilst I agree that catching some enemies with a forest snare seems not thematically brilliant, I have few arguments. One, the snare needs not mean a rope, it can be anything. Other, and I may address it in a solo thread, I feel like having a winged Nazgul is not very thematic itself, weren't they supposed to fly fell beasts much later in the story?

For other enemies like trolls or the beast moster it is not a promblem.A rope (or an elvish rope) or a trap can hold those creatures but the Nazguls are wraiths and no physical trap can hold them.You can fight with them,you can drove them away but you can't catch them.

As for the fell beasts you are right.First appearance of a winged Nazgul is at Aduin river wen Legolas shoots one down with his bow but we already have Legolas and Gimli fight together and Denethor leaves Gondor for some quests so a winged Nazgul is not the only thematic issue.

You haven't played many card games, have you?  Errata's happen.  Either there is a mistake during printing, or a card turns out to be too strong/weak.  When LotR Core set goes into another printing (I guess the 3rd), then the Errata should be on the cards in that printing.

Oh come on, boy, don't be rude. I said I understand there'll be mistakes.

I also understand the "improvement", Nazgul should not be caught like that. I questioned Forest Snare the first time I saw it, it seemed a bit too powerful and I wondered whether there be limitations to that.

And I really like the game - VERY much, actually. I just find this to be very silly of them - not to think of this situation in time. I do not claim to be super quick with this stuff and I saw it the first day of owning the game, thinking it won't be such a big deal to deal with the Nazgul as long as you get a Forest Snare - and you have more than a quest card to get it. I wonder how they could miss it whilst playtesting.

## 24 [Titan on May 21, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47102-faq-is-here/?do=findComment&comment=472282)

I don't like the errata on the Nazgul, either. Considering that Forest Snare is an attachment and therefore can only be played during the planning phase, there will be a confrontation. The Nazgul will get to swing, even if it is for only one turn. Now, you are forced to face him head on. Just making a very difficult scenario for solo players even more difficult. As for thematic interactions, I rarely concern myself with them, it's a card game and most games will have something that doesn't make sense in that way. Legolas is a glaring omission, though.

I absolutely agree here, and I'm not sure why there's so much confusion about Legolas (of course I mean no offense Mestrahd). The rulebook is very clear about active locatons:

 

Any progress tokens that would be placed on a quest card are instead placed on the active location. pg 15

I know. Not a big deal. I thought better of it (the line I wrote) myself and said so in the next post (if you noticed) but I see I could just edited it.

I have played games. Perhaps not as many as you but perhaps before you yourself were born. Anyways, most of the errata (as far as I remember) is usually clarification of the rules, not changing them - less so after less than a month of play or so.

I hope they print the Nazgul again and include it for free in one of the adventure packs so I can have the proper card in my game. Same for the ChieftaIn (proof-read anyone?) or the big bug for me The FavoUr of the Lady - how come there is an American spelling in a Tolkien game, for Tolkien's sake.

 yeah... every card game has its erratas... because of the language "barrier" :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

but it doesn't bode well for the designers... even I saw this combo like the first time I played scenario 2 or 3... oh,  cool, I'll just use forest snare to halt the nazgul :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] or the troll... they should have taken that into consideration... but, ah, well, doesn't matter... it's actually more fun that way... we beat the nazgul anyway today... with legolas and gimli :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] and gandi :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] he just doesn't stand a chance :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

 So... due to the way damage works with multiple defenders, Stand Together doesn't do anything whatsoever?

It appears many of the official FAQ answers use the most counter-intuitive solution possible. While it's nice to have official word on who controls (or doesn't control) Caught in a Web, I find many other card interactions have become less clear. Important ones have already been mentioned.

Ah well, I suppose we'll be waiting for a clarification of the clarification, then. Such are FAQs.

HyenaSpotz said:

I think it changed only with regard to where/who you can apply the damage to. Multiple defenders still add up their total Defense, subtracting that total from the attacker's Attack. If any damage is left to be dealt, then that damage must go to a single defender. Before the FAQ, you were able to split the remaining damage however you liked, so 3 dmg to be dealt with 3 2HP units defending, all would survive (by assigning 1 dmg to each), now one of them dies.

Dam said:

I agree that appears to be the most intuitive way of handling the situation, but do they add together? I see nothing in either the rules or on Stand Together to suggest that multiple defenders actually add their Defense Strengths. Judging from this thread and others, and the material from the FAQ, intuition or common sense appears to be a poor way of figuring out the rules.

I should clarify I'm not upset by any of these things, since emotion is hard to read in text. It is just a minor frustration.

Normally you are only allowed to defend with one character, then you deduct Defense from Attack.

"This is done by
subtracting the defense strength (Ú) of the defending
character from the attack strength (Û) of the attacking
enemy." (p. 18)

Stand Together allows you to declare multiple characters as defending character, for me it merely adds a 's' at the end of "character" in that above quote. If you don't add up their defense values, then ST is about as coaster as it gets, absolutely no use.

## 33 [GodRob on May 22, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47102-faq-is-here/?do=findComment&comment=472772)

Each card should have some benefit (events and allies) or detriment (enemies and shadow cards).  If one interpretation of the card text forces the card to be completely useless, then it's obviously not the correct interpretation.  Since "Stand Together" is not a useless card then it must provide some benefit and the only benefit it can provide (with the restriction stated in the FAQ) is that you combine the defense rating of all characters committed to defending against that attack.

The same argument can be used for the Wargs.  Since one interpretation of their card text is obviously useless then that cannot be the correct inerpretation.  They remain engaged until the shadow card is revealed and then their special instructions take effect.

The Legolas / Gondolin Blade interpretation can go either way.  Each interpretation is beneficial.  However, in gameplay it is actually to your benefit to place the progress markers on the Active Location.  Just try it.

It's nice to see an official ruling on Chieftan Ufthak since it really can be interpreted either way.  I don't like it but at least it is now the official way to play.

Dol Guldor Beastmaster also only has one interpretation that makes sense.  Dealing the second shadow card after his attack is resolved would be completely useless and can't possibly be the correct interpretation.  If you are engaged with five enemies, deal each enemy a Shadow Card based on their threat level (highest first).  After those cards are dealt, deal another to the Dol Guldor Beastmaster.

Not being able to Snare the Nazgul?  I can live with that.  I can snare other enemies if I need to.

Again, I don't see how it can be interpreted more than one way.

 

"Instead, an active location acts as a buffer for the currently revealed quest card. Any progress tokens that would be placed on a quest card are instead placed on the active location."

 

ANY progress tokens that WOULD be placed...

I'm not trying to be rude by hammering this point over and over, but I am trying to understand the argument for any other intepretation.

## 35 [DrNate on May 23, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47102-faq-is-here/?do=findComment&comment=472827)

You are right. The rulebook only says "placed" it really doesn't say anything about "removed" so I'd probably always take them from the quest itself.

## 36 [Baenre on May 23, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47102-faq-is-here/?do=findComment&comment=472866)

I'm confused as to why people don't understand the Legolas /Blade question.  The rules SPECIFICALLY say that the cards break the rules when there is a discrepency.  Legolas and the blade place on the quest plain and simple.  The only time you place tokens meant for the quest on a location is during the quest phase when you have more influence than shadow and when a card specifically says to.  IE Rangers and such.  Now if they come out and say the opposite they are contradicting themselves.

Legoals is designed to help tactics decks which have notoriously LOW influence keep their deck moving along on the quest.  If you want abilities that place on quests instead of locations play with Rangers and such.

I do however disagree with the Stand Together ruling.  If you play it and keep it to the letter of the rules they should be allowed to spread the dmg out form whatever wasn't blocked.  This is actually a pretty dangerous ruling considering the rules aren't very tight in some sections.  It certainly doesn't make the card bad or worthless but it doesn't justify it being a one per box.  IE Rare.  They also set another dangerous precedent just arbitarily changing the wording on cards. 

I certainly hope these were all answered by the games designer but looking at how little info we got form a FAQ i am skeptical about that.  They need to be very careful how they proceed form this point forth or they will sink their own game before it even get soff the ground.

But I don't think any card is breaking the rules here, so I don't see a contradiction. The way I see it, Legolas places two progress tokens on the current quest. Any progress tokens that would be placed on the current quest get placed on the active location instead. Where's the contradiction?

And I don't see anything in the rulebook that even implies the marked sentence in the above quote.

But I don't think any card is breaking the rules here, so I don't see a contradiction. The way I see it, Legolas places two progress tokens on the current quest. Any progress tokens that would be placed on the current quest get placed on the active location instead. Where's the contradiction?

And I don't see anything in the rulebook that even implies the marked sentence in the above quote.

 

 



 

I concur. Legolas only "breaks" the rules insofar, as he gets to place progress tokens after a kill... that's the only exception... everything else - progress tokens are placed "normally", i.e. active location if one is there.

And in do so, Legolas is still helping the group move a long on their journey.

I'm yet to beat the 3rd scenario, but I bet you can guess which card I was sitting with two copies of when the staging area was empty other than the Nazgul

Why couldn't that have happened last week!

Too bad they haven't clearified the Northern tracker discussion yet. Hope this will be added to the FAQ in the following weeks.

I didn't realize there was a debate going on about the Northern Tracker. What is the issue with it?
