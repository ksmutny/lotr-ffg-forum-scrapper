Hello.  I have the core set of the LotR card game and was thinking about getting this to play as well.  How do you play it?  Do the cards mix in with the ones from the core set or do you play it as a stand alone game?  Just trying to figure out how it would work before I buy it.

I'm not sure what you mean by "this".

I would ask the same question. What is this that you want to get?

Apologies, I was under the black riders forum when I posted this. I wasn't aware that they all went to the same place. The Black Riders set, and the two Hobbit sets are what interested in at the moment.

The quests and encounter cards are stand alone. To play these scenarios you can (and need to) use all the player cards you have. It's gonna be very tough though if you only own the saga expansions and the core set.

indeed i agree with leptokurt. and i can assume that you are a new-ish player with a small number of packs (or none)?

 

if so i would recommend getting a few packs out of the mirkwood cycle first, and then perhaps khazad dum
