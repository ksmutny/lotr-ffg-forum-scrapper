In the case of a card like "Hithaeglir Foothills - The Dunland Trap", which gains one resource "after a player draws any number of cards", is this 2 resources during the draw phase because two players drew a card? Or is it just one if players draw simultaniously. Because Hithaeglir Foothills has no cap for instance,when we played it forced the threat in the staging area up to almost twenty, while Stage 3 had another activate location in play so we couldn't travel there, and we were way too burdened with enemies to quest all out. Bit broken if so.

Yes, it'll trigger separately for each player during the resource phase.  Very deadly card in multiplayer if you don't handle it quickly.

Do you have a quotation for that?

 

Because I would think that since players draw simultaneously it will only trigger once in the resource phase; the danger being in players risking to draw cards individually during the staging step.

All characters ready simultaneously during the refresh phase, but we once had official clarification that Silvan Tracker can heal each of them.  It doesn't matter that this happens simultaneously, they are still discrete events and count as separate triggers for a response.

I´ll accept that reasoning as gospel.

 

Feel a bit bummed I didn´t make that connection myself  :unsure: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_unsure.png]

If you're interested, that ruling about Silvan Tracker is in the thread here [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/87463-silvan-tracker/page-2].
 
You can trigger the Silvan Tracker's ability for each Silvan character that readies during the refresh phase. If 8 Silvan character's ready at the same time, you will trigger the Response 8 times and resolve them one by one.

I did know about the Silvan Tracker ruling, which is why I feel I should have connected the dots in regards to this as well.
