Im just curious if anyone else is playing the game with the basic rule(not dealing shadow cards) found on page 27 of the rule book for solo play.  I hadn't planned on using this but once my win-loss ratio went 1:3 i started to.  I can't help but feel like a wuss doing it and I think im going to tough it out and return to normal play. So i was just wondering if anyone else was in the same boat.

Nah. I much prefer using two player decks when playing solo. It's a lot closer to how the game was designed to be played.

hmm interesting. I might try it but one thing, if i remember correctly, is your not supposed to know what the other players have in their hand.

Yes. One the one hand that makes it slightly easier than a two-player game because you can coordinate your efforts better. On the other hand you have to keep track of everything on your own and don't get any helpful input from a second player. A side benefit is that it helps you in testing the decks you build for multiplayer games, so you can use them unchanged if a player joins you. It's great to find out what works well together.
