# [Question about Turn Counting and scoring...](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58730-question-about-turn-counting-and-scoring/)

So according to the manual, turns are counted during the refresh phase, so The very first turn of the game is TURN 1... but if you complete the game on TURN 12, then you do not count that turn as you finish the game before turn 12 is counted.....

So all my scores are 10 points to high?

Is that right?

Its a good question if you have to count your last turn.

As written in FAQ 1.2 you tally at the refresh phase of each turn.
If you win during turn 10 (normaly during quest or combat phase) you tallied 9 turns, therefore your score has to be 90 and not 100.

In my opinion a little bit illogical, to count 1 turn less than started to play, but this seems to be the scoring rule just to count fully played turns...

I think for me, it is easier to start at ZERO. As you said, this just makes it easier to tally at the refresh phase. The first turn is not marked "Turn 1" until it is complete.

As I tell me 6 year old when teaching her board games, "don't count the space you're on as 1, count the first space you come to as 1." Another way to say that is, you don't start counting until you have left the space you're on.

I am a RACING fan, Lap 1 is not counted until you go around once.

 So what I usually do is on a piece of paper, write down R for rounds, T for threat.  Then underneath R start with 0 and your initial threat under T.  Each time I come to the refresh phase then, I raise my round number by 1 along with my threat raise of 1.  Any threat raises that happen during the turn I put +# next to my current threat so that as I am tracking it on the counter and paper, the numbers are always corresponding.

It's right.

 

Had to correct twenty something results I had already logged in the quest racker.

 

@ Zjb12:

Why don't you use the second threat counter to tally your rounds?

I like to use an extra threat tracker to help me track my number of rounds like this:

1) It starts the game at 0.

2) Then, during each Refresh Phase, right after I raise my treat tracker by 1, I also raise my "round tracker" by 1.

3) When I finish the game, whatever number is on the round tracker gets multiplied by 10 and added to my final score.

Counting the round at the end of the Refresh Phase (the very end of the round) makes sense to me because then you only add 10 to your score for each full round completed. Playing a full round = 10 points. Playing a (final) fraction of a round = 0 points.

 Juicebox, leptokurt:  I never thought of that!  Thanks!

I found that it's really easy to just use damage tokens for my turn counter. I've got a "turn counter" pile and during the refresh phase I just grab another damage token and toss it in the pile. I've never even come close to using all the damage tokens (especially since I have 2 core sets). At the end, count up all the damage tokens in that pile and you've got the number of turns. It's really simple. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Good idea too.
