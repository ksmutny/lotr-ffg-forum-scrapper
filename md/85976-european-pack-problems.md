i have sent an email to ffg customer services asking about the situation with the packs being so behind getting to europe. now i know here in the UK we are not the worst...some poor people are still to get the early packs.

...however around mirkwood cycle the timing difference between UK (and i know from a friend in another part of europe)  and the USA was around 3-4 weeks.

 

now we are 2 whole packs behind. it is not even a case of my store being behind as i know this is a problem for many UK game stores.

 

now i know many will say 'buy from here' or 'buy from this USA store' however i prefer to buy from my native companies as i am loyal to certain stores who give loyalty points allowing me to purchase extras such as sleeves and so on...and well, it just feels 'better' buying from the smaller stores...

 

so....is anywhere else in europe seeing a problem recently?...remember im asking if you are seeing an increase in pack's timing...i am aware that the UK isnt the worst off here, and im a patient person...so im not complaining per se, im just curious why this is

rich

ps. and yes- this thread is fuelled by the awful anticipation to get my hands on the new cards :blink: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_blink.png]

pps. i even looked on amazon and there is only 1 in stock for forest- around £30 with postage

the game is not even 1/4 as popular as it was on release. Most players have moved on and many LCG players bumped it for the hugely popular Netrunner and Star Wars games. The simple truth is no matter how much the reaminign loyal customers of LoTR are or the new ones coming in at a trickle.. there is simply not the demand for that game there once was. This means less copies in a single print run, witch means the delays get longer and longer. This is not somthign you can stop, and it will get worse before stabilizing. Same thing happens will all the other LCGs. I know you do not want to hear it.. but if you want them faster.. order them off a website, complaining to ffg will not do anything.

Yeah totally understand wanting to buy from your own store :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] I'm in US so can't really help you. But I'm sure it's very annoying.... :mellow: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_mellow.png]

well, it is not the way you want to go.. and I myself also believe in customer loyalty.. but .. well if they do not have the item you want.. .. .. . you only have 2 choices.

that is indeed true, and something i will probably at least consider doing until things get quicker. or perhaps i shall just wait....it has only been these last two packs that have been the issue, i am hoping that by the end the cycle and the start of black rider things will be a little better

Hi Richsabre,

 

Here in Denmark I am almost always able to buy the APs within 1 week after they have been announced as released on the FFG homepage. The Amon Din AP I could buy the same day or the day after release date. I have observed that my local shop normally gets a small batch (maybe 3-5 packs it seems) and then later gets more. If you are too slow and do not buy one from the first shipment then you may have to wait a bit longer. Luckily, in those situations, I have another shop close by that also gets the APs pretty quick so I have never had to wait much.

 

Maybe it is a matter of how often your game dealer gets deliveries from FFG. If it is just once per month you could often end up with 3 weeks of waiting, I guess.

this could be it... are you per-ordering the packs? Many stores get stock and then sell the pre-orders then have to wait for the next lot of stock and that can take ages.

## 9 [mr.thomasschmidt on July 8, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85976-european-pack-problems/?do=findComment&comment=809868)

Hi Rich.

Not a problem in Norway either. We don't have the third pack yet but the two first are still in stock on the two most popular Norwegian web stores. I think maybe you get a more correct answer to this situation if you write the company you normally order from. They would be the best to answer why it takes them so long when so many others have them :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

In Spain we are getting the (localized) packs the same day as USA.

It doesn't surprise me that Scandinavia is the best of Europe. But I'm not form there... Here, in Central Europe, I still wait for the Forest though we have some lovely ones in the area.

Austria was 2-3 months behind, but then I got Steward's Fear and Druadan Forest (english versions) in one go. Now we'll see how long Amon Din will take...

## 13 [leptokurt on July 8, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85976-european-pack-problems/?do=findComment&comment=809978)

They just delayed the German version of "On the Doorstep". Perhaps they will sell it end of July. I fear we might loose a lot of German speaking players due to no packs (except of HoN) for more than half a year.

We, also in Central Europe, have expansions only up to Heirs of Númenor available. If I wasn't buying from bookdepository, I'd have less APs than I currently do. Not to mention the high prices in local shops mean that there is no point in buying from them at all. Screw supporting the local shops when they screw us...

## 15 [DevastazioneH88 on July 8, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85976-european-pack-problems/?do=findComment&comment=809991)

I just ordered encounter at amon din which should arrive later this week at my home. As some of you know I buy my LCG stuff from the book depository because it has the best prices (and because being in frickin' Italy I wouldn't be able to buy them anywhere else, surely not in english, and I don't buy translated stuff because most of the time they suck). My point is, book depository is a UK based company, so if they have them, it shouldn't be a problem of distribution to Europe (nor the UK). It might be a local retailer issue only :/.

## 16 [richsabre on July 8, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85976-european-pack-problems/?do=findComment&comment=810006)

thanks all for your replies. it has been very useful.

 

as for the pre ordering idea, i would agree that i may have missed packs, however i usually pre order my packs a month in advance, so it cannot be that.

 

i think it must be the timing of the shipments to individual stores as people say....though im surprised other areas of europe get them so quickly.

 

i have wrote to both ffg and my store ,so when i get replies i will post them here for insterest

in the meantime im pleased other areas are still getting them quick!

thanks!

There has definitely been a problem with "The Drúadan Forest" - the last set was available about a week after the US, something has happened with with set two, though set three has only just been announced as available in the US so I wouldn't expect that until next week anyways. I asked the lady in Orc's Nest and she didn't know when to expect it tbh. I didn't ask at FP when in London but it wasn't on the shelves - my only guess is a problem with it coming over. Is it Diamond (the comic supplier) who ship FFG stuff fover?                  

## 18 [mr.thomasschmidt on July 9, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85976-european-pack-problems/?do=findComment&comment=810648)

Just wanted to correct myself a little. I mostly buy from a Norwegian homepage and thus always have access to the newest packs within the week it's released. However, I just found out that the page isn't a genuine norwegian page. It has a lot of norwegian books and the like but it's origin is from another country. Possible Great Britain. I don't have any local game stores to support but those with a homepage to order from. And I just now found out that one of the 2 stores has the Forest as a NEW package where it doesn't mention Amon Din at all. The other store which mainly distribute via homepage but have a small room to store all the goods in have it for sale already. AND you can see an overview of all planned expansions and AP's. So this tells me that it all really depends on the store rather than maybe the amount of packages/delivery time. That it depends much more on whether the store really have the fan group needed/interest in the game in order to focus more or less on this game.

That's interesting. You use ogg games, don't you, rich? I'm a 13th Floor man, who last week got the new expansions for AGoT, Warhammer (UK getting it before the USA!) and Star Wars, but still no sign of AP2, let alone 3. Seems it's not just a problem with getting LCG packs into the UK, but it's limited to just getting LotR packs here. 

 

I'll email 13th Floor and see what they can say about it...

hey spalanzani. yeah thats right, i use oggames because they let you buy credits to use later on which is perfect for me. nowhere else really does that.

its a relief to hear its not just them though, do let me know what they say. aparently oggames will know more by this friday

Had a reply from 13th floor:

 

Unfortunately the FFG stuff is a bit of a mystery, even to their UK distributor :-(
 
They know that it's coming, they just don't know when (normally a slow boat from China I'm told!)
 
Sometimes they get some stock airmailed to stop retailers 'grey importing' but usually only core sets and boardgames.
 
These expansions are not on our supplier pre-order list, which generally means they'll just appear to us in theFriday release sheet - the week before they're due out.
 
That also means they could be imminent (e.g. next Tue/Wed!)

 

So, yeah... a bit of a mystery, but hopefully it won't be too long. It happened once, from what I remember, with pack one in the last Warhammer cycle - pack 2 came out roughly on time, followed by pack one about 7 or 8 weeks after it should have been out. So maybe we'll get a glut of them soon...

I don't buy LCG packs locally at all. The prices are outrageous - some LotR LCG packs are £20! Three at a time from Miniature Market is just right. Below the customs limit, so no VAT, and it's the largest shipment which is still within reason for shipping costs. I get 3 packs from the US for less than the price of two packs locally, shipping included.

 

As for how soon they're available it really varies. My FLGS is bloody useless. The website has some lower prices, but it's only updated whenever the guy who does that can be bothered. In most cases new, major products aren't even added to the front page, or even the product list. Dominion:Dark Ages didn't get a single mention, even though they dedicated a whole table to it when it finally arrived.

 

Typically the best way to get them to have a new pack in the store within a week of US release is to order it from the US. They'll have it a few days before my order arrives, without fail :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

i took a look at the bookdepositry

http://bookdepository.co.uk/ [http://bookdepository.co.uk/]

 

they seem to have good prices. but do not have forest or amon din in stock. im guessing at this point its sold out. still i will be also considering it for future releases if the situation with uk stores gets no better. i am willing to wait, but being almost 3 packs behind (without the need for translation or anything) is too much for me to stay loyal

i had a look at minature market, but the price of postage is just far to high for 1 pack at a time. i would not order more than that as i buy the packs as they come out, and waiting for more than one would of course be pointless as this is my issue here

If you need any help in the future ordering fast and cheap I'll be happy to help.

1 AP is £13,5 incl. shipping to me and then an additional £4 for postage to GB. That's a total of £17,5.

thats very kind of you! i will indeed consider it. it is as you say rather high compared to the £12 or so with shipping from uk, but its not different than buying from the US (i think miniture market was around £15-16 with shipping, it may be easier on both of us for me to do that, rather than bother you haha). how quickly did you say you got the packs compared to the US?

I'm pretty sure you don't have to pay VAT. Bit that depends on GB's laws. You should have a value that if you keep imported stuff beneath that amount you should be safe. In Norway that value is $30. I member vi have discussed this before but can't remember what you found out that value was :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

BUT if you just post in the comment at check out at miniaturemarket if they'd be kind to write the value on the package to something beneath that magic value limit they always help you. I have before ordered for about $80 and they put the value to $30. Went right through custom and all ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

I believe my online Norwegian store has them at the same time as FFG or at least within the same week.

But so,etching else occurs to me. Maybe the store I mentioned in my thread about finding the mirkwood cycle would be a choice?

Norway and the UK have the same minimal VAT-free amount for imports. Just barely enough for 3 packs when the dollar is cheap :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

thanks for that, i will also take a look at the store you mentioned that had mirkwood in stock. at the moment it looks like the cheapest for buying single packs, which i what im going to do, is minituremarket

ok so i went to speak to minituremarket's live chat. i wanted to ask, given the limit for non tax in the UK is £15 and my overall order including postage was over this, would they put on the package the amount, minus the postage, so it was under the £15.

 

however....i was either talking to a computer, or their was some major confusion...the guy kept asking me how i could be assisted, after i was asking the same question. has anyone had any luck on the live chat?

## 37 [evilidler on July 12, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85976-european-pack-problems/?do=findComment&comment=812852)

I guess you'll have to e-mail them about that issue. If there's no visible e-mail, the live chat should convert to e-mail messaging outside business hours. Unless that part is also broken :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

But whoah, £15?! Looks like it changed only recently. I could have sworn it was £20-25. It's official then - UK citizens are the most screwed ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

 

If it's any comfort, there doesn't seem to be an 8% tax on neckties, at least.

i know.....from what i could see, it is £36 for a gift, £15 for something you buy, that was on the official site so it must be correct.

Ordering from the US is practically pointless if you're in the UK, then. With the shipping costs there is no point where you save enough to make a big order worth it, unless you order half a gaming store worth of games. I've made many calculations :/

 

A friend in the US would help, of course. I use the "friend in the UK/Germany" trick for console/computer games, because they're ridiculously overpriced here. Pre-owned is more than new from ShopTo or Play, for instance. But we also have a gift limit over £100.

What!!! No tax on neckties?!? You guys live in heaven ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]:P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

Seriously though, I'm pretty sure you can order something to £15 WITHOUT including the shipping. In Norway it's $30 and if it cost more you pay tax/duty/whatsoever for the total amount items+shipping. But if the item itself cost $30 it doesn't matter what the total amount is including shipping. Does that make any sense?

## 41 [evilidler on July 12, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85976-european-pack-problems/?do=findComment&comment=812914)

£15 = 137 NOK, so it's pretty limited. But yeah, it doesn't include shipping. Although customs in Norway HAVE screwed up occasionally and done that. And in the UK it's extra important to include invoices, or they'll evaluate VAT based on local prices.  The UK has decent places to order things from, though. Games Lore and Maddison are a couple of places with reasonable prices for LCG stuff.

## 42 [richsabre on July 12, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85976-european-pack-problems/?do=findComment&comment=812922)

yes, im having a lot of trouble still finding a store that will guarantee they will include all the things on the packaging to make sure that it goes through correctly, and im not particularly willing to risk it, given i could end up paying for 2 packs work for 1 pack.

 

the shipping times were also estimated up to 3 months for some places!

 

i use gameslore occasionally, though it appears they also have none in stock yet

I just ordered a book from a third-party dealer on Amazon, with an estimated 30+ days of shipping. It shipped the next day, and left Chicago hours later (Chicago is basically home stretch for my orders - 2-4 days later I have it.). Those estimates are averages, thanks tho 3rd world shipping dragging it up ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

 

My record time is close to 2 days (~48 hours from order to all the way over here in Europe), and the worst is about 10 working days after USPS have received it. There are of course packing delays many places, like Miniature Market have at the moment. I guess it's con season.

 

Whoever sets up a printing press for game companies in a cheaper European country is going to get rich quickly! I'd love to have a nearly local place games could be shipped from.

I'm not so sure about the cycles and expansions, and in what order they have been released. Is it like this?

 

The Core Set

 

Shadows of Mirkwood:

- The Hunt for Gollum

- Conflict at the Carrock

- A Journey to Rhosgobel

- The Hills of Emyn Muil

- The Dead Marshes

- Return to Mirkwood

 

Khazad-Dûm expansion

 

The Dwarrowdelf:

- The Redhorn Gate

- The Road to Rivendell

- The Watcher in the Water

- The Long Dark

- Foundations of Stone

- Shadow and Flame

 

The Hobbit: Over Hill and Under Hill

 

The Hobbit: On the Doorstep

 

The Heirs of Númenor

 

Against the Shadow:

- The Steward's Fear

- The Druadan Forest

- Encounter at Amon Dín

- Assault on Osgiliath

- The Blood of Gondor

- The Morgul Vale

 

 

I know that all these are available here in Sweden, except for the last 3 in the Gondor cycle. Am I missing something? What about "Massing at Osgiliath"?

## 47 [richsabre on July 16, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85976-european-pack-problems/?do=findComment&comment=815074)

yes thats about correct, though in the uk hiers of numenor came out between hobbit packs 1 and 2.

massing at osgilliath is a print on demand pack, which was part of gaming event i believe. they are brought out afterwards in cheaper quest packs that have no player cards in so dont form part of the proper pack series

theres also another called the battle of laketown

 

your card pool is correct, you have everything that is out at the moment all the way to amon din. here in the uk we have stewards fear as the most recent pack - 2 packs behind you

I still have faith that the UK will get the packs soon. My oft-cited example of the Warhammer pack Days of Blood coming out about 6 weeks after it was initially released is beginning to wear a little too thinly, of course, but I hope that any day now, hopefully sometime this week, we'll get them. I think it's been two weeks since 13th floor had any FFG stuff in, in case this has any bearing on them getting more  :unsure: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_unsure.png]

I got ti in my shop since i do events for Lotr there. But is not much players around in Bangkok......So i got all 3 packs in the end.

If you look my videos in youtube,  there is a one about nighmare packs with all cards and so on. Just chek it out.

 





 

Nightmare is really cool and bring game on the whole level. Feeling is the same when you play against a real opponent like in MTG or some........ You really need to hav a good deck to win and there is no insure until last round you always on the edge. I love it! We play Dol-Guldor NM and win twice but it was so hard and interesting. Now you really feel enemies and locations and they are  dangerous!

 

Bu the way i remember you stop to play for a while and leave us......so you back to game again?

## 56 [mr.thomasschmidt on July 17, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85976-european-pack-problems/?do=findComment&comment=815802)

Yeah I'm back. But are they for sale yet or are they just items for event nights? I remember about reading about game kits for event nights in shops but I haven't read anything about a nightmare core set in sale for now. Or is the plan not to release Nm core sets to the public but instead do mn print on demand sets? I think I read something about that too.

Sorry for sidetracking you thread rich.

I think they have yet to be released as Print on demand expansion, other than that, you have to get them on game nights. If you don't have any shop organizing them (like me), you have to wait.

Yes for now they part of Kit for league play but after will be avialable as POD. I wait for second Kit now more then Last Cycle packs to be  honest.  But Assault in Osgiliath and Morgule vale looks very  promising.

Yes, it was a sad day when I couldn't find my lizardman king avatar! I am considering making a transatlantic order for the packs if they don't arrive soon, I have to say. But the last time I did this for LotR, I ended up paying double due to postage that, if I had waited just one more week, I could have got them at the normal price! So I'm a bit hesitant to do that again...

 

As regards the game night kits, it says here [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=3792] that they will arrive later in 2013 as POD  -_- [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sleep.png]

The two PODs, the Massing at Osgiliath and the Battle of Lake-town, were Gen Con events and brought out a few months after the event. This year Gen Con Indy 2013 is 15-18 August. Usually by now there has been some mention about an event at Gen Con on here, unusually quiet this time round.

 

 

I'll hold off buying from outside the UK for now, I may try and contact the sellers I have used on ebay (some who also have physical stores), see what info they have. I hope FFG and suppliers sort out their issues, we are over a month behind right now.

From Germany i can report that it takes about 3 to 6 months to get the localised/translated packs. The german publisher is Heidelberger Spieleverlag. At the moment we are lacking the last three of the Against the Shadow Cycle and the Hobbit on the Doorstep extension. The Black Rider extension is announced for second half this year, which probably means aroung christmas...

//EDIT: For the last three Shadow Cycle packs the publisher announced to release one pack every month from now on...

We had both POD Sets really fast though, no nightmare sets are announced yet.

Because of some imprecise translation issues i thought of changing to the english version, but if you started in one language you normally don't want to mix up your cards later. We'll see if i have to change anyway if the game continues to loose players.

Hi, I am also based in the UK, got tired of waiting and ordered from Miniature Market on 16/07,  it Arrived today.

 

I just paid for the basic postage option and for 2 packs cost just over £24 which isn't too bad, just a little more than I usually pay if they arrive in the UK.

 

Worth a thought if you are getting desperate for new shiny's like I was.

> Since the BookDepository are based in the UK, does anyone have any info on whether or not they're gonna recieve Druadan Forest and Amon Din any soon, if they're gonna have it?

They've been in stock at Book Depository before (that's where I got my copies of both those packs from), so they don't seem to have been affected by the UK delays.

For anyone in Germany, Magierspiele has the AtS packs still in stock as well as most of the older adventure packs:

In Spain so far we are getting the adventure packs and the saga expansion the same day as USA. Indeed I'll get "Assault on Osgiliath" tomorrow morning.

 

There is a publisher here that is like a FFG's young brother and sometimes makes a good, up to date and translated distribution of some FFG's products.

You're lucky, here the only publisher that brings FFG's stuff is Devir and they suck (at least in Chile). Also be sure to spoil us with the player and the overall adventure as soon as you get it, please! (even better with images).

Mine have arrived via Games Lore ebay! Hopefully we'll get back on track now :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

If anyone is struggling to get a copy and lives near Manchester, Fanboy 3 let me know they had restocked a few days ago too.

A lot of the UK problems are at the distributor, www.esdeviumgames.co.uk .  At one point, we had a 6 month delay on a Game of Thrones chapter pack before it eventually showed up (the weirdest thing was every other pack released during that time was pretty much on time).  I eventually gave up and ordered from Austria (www.eaglecard.org) - who do good prices that, with shipping, are about the same as RRP in the UK.  The rest of Europe manages to get stuff on time, so I don't think it's an FFG shipping problem.

 

I always find it useful to check their weekly release sheets on the Esdevium website-  they post what they are releasing next week on their homepage around 4pm every Friday, so i don't have to bother my gaming store (www.boardgameguru.co.uk) every week.
