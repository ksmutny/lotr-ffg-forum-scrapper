Are the Eye of Sauron Sleeves:

 

1. Opaque enough to cover the difference between Nightmare and regular card backs? and;

 

2. As sturdy as, if not sturdier than, Dragon Shield sleeves (I have had no complaints with Dragon Shield so far).

 

Thanks!

I use FFG Eye of Sauron sleeves for my encounter cards precisely because they mask the difference between standard encounter cards and POD Nightmare cards. I do not own any Dragon Shield sleeves, so I cannot compare the FFG Art sleeves to those. I will say that in 3 years of use I have yet to damage an FFG sleeve, so they are certainly sturdy enough for my needs.

ok, so for me, they will definitely cover the difference but I wont say that they are invincible.  first off, when I got them, they started to slowly split when I would shuffle them, and now I am just supper careful and it doesn't happen any more.   They do hold up so, considering only 2 or 3 have ever broken, but I would say you have to be very careful with them.

Art sleeves are scarce where I live, but I use FFG's transparent ones. I too find that overall they hold together rather well - I've only had one or two split, and that was due to reckless/forced shuffling by someone else. A friend is using the Daughter of the Nimrodel art sleeves for his player deck and he's had no problems with them.
