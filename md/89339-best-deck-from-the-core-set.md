So I'm going back to the beginning to try and ace the core set without a loss.  What are your best decks for each quest?  Did you have one that took the entire quest set for wins?  If so let me know so I can try them out!  Battle reports to follow on my favorites.

Do you mean using only the Core set player cards too?  If so... good luck.

Yes, I'm looking to make a capable custom deck for each scenario from the original cards.  I haven't played the game for a very long time so I'm trying to reacquaint myself with the game.  I refuse to buy any of the adventure packs until I complete these all the way through again.

One, two or three core sets? And how many players?

mmmm...tough one, we are all so used to our glorfindels and hamas here ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

 

i would say lore spirit is the way to go. though perhaps leadership is key to get steward. perhaps....

 

gloin / beravor / eowyn

 

you have some nice quest power, beravors a nice all round hero and gloin could be a resource machine with self preservation, though steward of gondor is better and safer

 

have all the key cards such as test of will, hasty stroke, unexpected courage, steward of gondor, ever vigilant.

 

the problem with core is that the allies are really poor in comparison to later packs, and there is no song cards so multisphere building is tough.

 

i do think staying away from tactics is best, though if you do go tactics then legolas with the blades is the way to go. then you have some better allies.

 

hope this helps

The first core set deck I had much success with is somewhat similar to the one Rich just suggested above. Except I only play high threat decks under protest. (And 28 is much closer to "we have to fight the Hill Troll" than I'd like.)

 

So I used: Denethor, Theodred, Eowyn.

 

I usually put the Steward of Gondor on Eowyn, so she could pay for Galadhrim's Greetings and Northern Trackers. Theodred's resource is a bonus for him or Eowyn depending on cards in hand.

 

I didn't take it up against Escape from Dol Guldur, but I still don't like playing that one solo.

Escape is always going to be difficult for any non monosphere deck. The only time I have seen someone beat it consistently solo was when he cheated and chose his hero to be captured instead of doing it randomly. Still... in solo play I think there is no reason not to have steward.

As far as taking the hill troll.... gimli + citadel plate :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

probably the best solo is Gimly/Eowyn/Theodred. this deck can do everything quest, fight, resources generations, cancel shadow effect and when revealed effect. Have a strong allies like Northern tracker. I remember this kind of deck was quite cool in the time of Only Core set.
