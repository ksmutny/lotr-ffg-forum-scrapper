When I first thought about exclusives at Cons I'd never be able to get to I was "gah" but this print on demand malarky looks to be a great way to still get the exclusives for fans not able to make shows. Only one question, how much for shipping to the UK, I can't seem to find that info?

 How does one go about demanding a print?

You order it from FFG's store. In September when it's released.

My initial reaction was "oh crap, how much is this gonna cost me off Ebay?"

But, after taking the time to actually finish reading the article I'm pretty excited about them offering it via Print on Demand, that might end up being a very cool way for them to release extra content in addition to the soon to be monthly expansions.  People may complain about the card pool now, but we could potentially see it expand in a very big way if this PoD service really catches on with LotRtCG.

I'm not too excited about shipping probably costing me as much as each "micro-expansion," but if it means new cards, I'll gladly pay up.

I just bought my session at GENCON, another can't wait!

 Nice to see that Lord of the Rings cards can be PoD. Now, how much do they want from me in exchange for PoD copies of the 13 "rares" from the core set?

FFG have previously said that because they can't guarantee 0 colour shift with POD the cards aren't suitable for providing cards that shuffle into existing decks, so that probably means they won't provide the rares via POD.

Conversely, it also probably means that the entire encounter deck for MaO will be new cards and not include any from the core set...

 It could also mean that you just purchase the quest cards and use encounter cards that have been released in the core set and adventure packs.

The write up specifically says the quest involves new locations and enemies.

So it does.  That's what I get for posting before reading.

Turns out I can make GENCON this year, so I just bought the last 2 tickets for Saturday at 11pm for myself and my son.  Looking forward to playing the new scenario.

Thanks,

I'm sure FFG would be happy to sell you some encounter deck art sleeves to sort out the potential colour shift issues...

(They also sell player deck backing at sleeves as well!).

A friend and I are signed up for the 9am Saturday game.

 

Anybody else going and signed up for one of the MaO events?
