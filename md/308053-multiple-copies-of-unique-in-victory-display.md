Can unique cards like the Red Arrow or Black Arrow be played if a copy already exits in the Victory Display?  I know they are limit 1 per deck, but if multiple players run them in their decks can they be played and used multiple times?

From the FAQs "Cards in the victory display are considered to be out of play" and the unique rule only takes into account cards "in play" so yes you could do that.
