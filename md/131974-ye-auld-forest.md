Finally got my pack and busted out my hobbit deck from The Black Riders. Great quest. The most fun I've had playing the game in a long time. Black Riders > Ring Goes South.

wait do you mean Black Riders > The Road Darkens? I'm confused =\

 

The Old Forest is great though huh? I really really like Barrow Downs as well but think there should be maybe a single copy (or two!) less of Great Barrow lol

Yeah, sorry. The Road Darkens. (I think I've done that before!) I'm looking forward to Barrow Downs.

How gnarly is Old Man Willow hey? Steals all your victory points, raises your threat like crazy, can't be destroyed but has to be damaged heavily to earn the boon! 

Pretty thematic though considering he almost put an end to the hobbit's quest single handedly.
