# [LotR:LCG FAQ?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60131-lotrlcg-faq/)

## 1 [Pericles on February 7, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60131-lotrlcg-faq/?do=findComment&comment=591033)

Is there a FAQ being maintained somewhere for this game?  I just started playing, and I have some questions related to specific cards.  I don't want to bog the forum down with queries that have, no doubt, been asked many times before.

 

Any help would be appreciated.

 I maintain an unofficial FAQ that gives notes, FAQs, etc, for every individual card here: javascript:void(0);/*1328642437043*/ [http://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/66894/comprehensive-card-reference-unofficial-faq].
