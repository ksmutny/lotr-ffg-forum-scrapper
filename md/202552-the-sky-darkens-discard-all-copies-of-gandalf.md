# [The sky darkens - discard all copies of Gandalf?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/202552-the-sky-darkens-discard-all-copies-of-gandalf/)

Hi,

the "When Revealed" effect of the Encounter Card "The Sky Darkens" reads:

 

"When Revealed: Each player must discard a random card from his hand. Each player then searces his deck for each other copy of the card he discarded, and discards those as well. Shuffle each searched deck."
 
If I randomly discard Gandalf core from my hand, do I also need to discard copies of Gandalf OHaUH from my deck (and vice versa)?
 
I believe yes (Gandalf is Gandalf, in whatever card incarnation, and thematically it would also make sense) but I just wanted to double-check.
 
Thanks!
 
A

I would have thought that there is a distinction between "copies of a card" and "cards with the same title", with the former specifically referring to cards that are identical in every way. On the other hand, the deck-construction rules give the 3-of rules as "three copies of any card, by title", which muddies the waters a bit.

I'm going to guess no. I think "all copies" refers only to exact copies. However, I have given up assuming that my guesses are correct so who knows.

I thought the real golden rule was that if it was bad for the players, that was likely the way it should be handled?

Each Gandalf card is a distinct card, but the same character. You wouldn't discard the other type of Gandalf.
