Do you think Amon Din is a must for Hobbit decks?  I'm going to get BR and am excited to make Hobbit decks, but was wondering if you think having ATS packs 3-6 (I have 1-2) are really necessary.  If they aren't I would be happy to skip the ATS cycle packs 3-6 until I find the money to buy them.  

 

Thanks

Though never played a Hobbit deck yet ( I plan to) , I believe that yes. Small target can be a very strong card IMO if you have other events that let you see what is coming from the encounter deck, and also Hobbit sense can prove usefull.

 

And there is Spirit Pippin

 

 

 

Yet again, there is no experience on Hobbit decks so ...

In amon din there are pippin, small target and hobbit sense. Pippin is weak, his lore version is much stronger. Only merit is that he is spirit, what gives you many threat reducers, but so is fatty and frodo. I didn't manage to make good use of small target, as in one player game I was engaged with only one enemy, and he was easly killed with Gandalf or even Gildor. However, I wasn't playing hard-fight scenarios as battle of five armies. Hobbit sense is quite good, as it allows you to quest really heavly, or to cancel attack and then kill enemy with Gandalf.

To sum up, till BR it was must-have, but now it became good addition. With so many hobbits card you'll easly build many decks.

Not essential at all. I can't remember which AP included fast hitch but go get it if you don't have it already

Not essential at all. Only good card is hobbit sense. Pippin is the worst and small target is generally too much of a gamble to be worth it. Plus the fact that you need to be engaged with two enemies for it somewhat goes against the hobbit theme

Agree with the rest. You can clearly do without Small Target for Hobbit decks. Hobbit Sense seems very situational, for once you want to avoid many enemies, and when you actually get them, it is better to deal with them. And the Black Riders Hobbits seem to know how to do that quite well. Finally, Lore Pippin is the way to go.

Small Target can be a great card, but it needs a lot of set up. Risk some Light has a beautiful synergy with that card. I usually played that combo when I faced one low threat enemy. I then engaged an additional high ATT enemy, played RsL to provide the hard hitter with the right shadow card. I let him kill the weak enemy and used Pippin's ability to send the remaiing enemy back to the staging area. Enemy dead, zero cost (secrecy!), 3 additional threat. To me that's a rather good deal.

 

To answer the question: Yes, I think if one wants to play Hobbit decks, he should have this adventure pack.

 

Edit:

 

And I just realized that Pippin's power is a response, so my plan doesn't work out quite as I planned. Grrrr...

hmm well many thanks people!  Helpful information.  

 

I wonder what the player cards in the Saga LOTR #2 box will be focused on?  We shall see.

This is a great question, worth of its own thread -- but I am sure that will come in due time. I really want it to bring more Elvish stuff, but I am also expecting the Fellowship to appear, quite simple really: Legolas, Gimli, Aragorn, Boromir - even if that means third versions for half of them and second for the rest.

As a solo player I really want to see Ally versions of the Fellowship.

## 12 [richsabre on September 12, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/90193-hobbits/?do=findComment&comment=864728)

i want to see lots and lots and lots of dwarves hahaha

 

no, i sort of do- my love for dwarves is ever lasting, though of course we already have dealt with balin's ill fated expedition

 

so i think elves is probably the way to go. even though silvan seems probable, i would actually prefer noldor- lots of rivendell based player cards

 

finally i would also like to see ally version of the fellowship and think this again is likely

Yes I agree its a good question.
 
Personally I'd be happy to see new versions of Legolas, Gimli, Aragorn, Boromir though considering the interview with Caleb Grace (http://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/89496-br-unboxing-with-caleb-grace/ [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/89496-br-unboxing-with-caleb-grace/]) where he explains why there wasn't a strider in the first box i'm not sure he would in the second...
 
They could release the Core hero's of the fellowship as Allies... like the Dwarfs and I guess that any of the following are potential saga hero's too; Glorfindel, Elrond, Arwen,  Erestor, Glóin, Bilbo & Gandalf... Gwaihir would awesome.

And I third this!   Even though I play two-handed solo, fellowship ally members would be really nice.

 

Denethor was one of our first heroes in the core set, and he just got his ally card debut, so this could mean other heroes will soon be representative as allies.  I'd really like to have the three hunters (Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli) because they are pivotal LotR characters that simply never see hardly any playtime for me because I choose other heroes.

 

Even though these hero-turned-ally cards wouldn't be as popular in 4-player quests (because they would limit the available hero pool to play as) I still really hope they are made for all the solo players.  And this is really bordering on an altogether different topic, but I actually believe I enjoy playing this game solo rather than with other people.  Now that may be because I've only ever played with other people that were pretty unfamiliar with the rules (so I had to manage a lot of what they did) but even so, I really just like playing on my own and not having to constantly be asking the other player(s) what responsibilities they'll handle for each round and stuff like that.

Okay, that's the end of my digression!

I think these allies would work great in the form of a neutral sphere like Gandalf and Radagast.  That way, any and all deck types could include them if they wished to.  I know a lot of people may be opposed to an increase in neutral allies (as they kind of take away from the distinctiveness of each sphere) but I think in the case of fellowship members, it might be a good approach.

Hmmm... not sure... I like that this would make them easy to include them in numerous decks... (especially once I have the the black riders, as i'm planning to replay most of the quests as hobbits and being able to include my favorite characters as allies would be cool!)

 

I'm not really too worried about the sphere distinctiveness - however I am concerned that neutral/nothing sphere gets treated differently and therefore could make them either more challenging or less appealing to use.
