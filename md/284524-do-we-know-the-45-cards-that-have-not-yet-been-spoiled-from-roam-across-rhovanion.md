I read there is a Glamdring in there too and was curious about its text.

Can anybody remind me how player Guarded keyword works? You attach the card to something that already exists, or god forbid draw something new?

For Glamdring, I think you pay one and then draw an encounter card to attach it on. Then you claim it once that encounter is gone? What if it is a treachery? You claim it immediately?

Glamdring says Gaurded (enemy or location).  After paying the resource to play it you place it in the staging area and then discard cards from the top of the encounter deck until an eligible target is discarded.  (In this case an enemy or location.). Then place that card in the staging area and attach Glamdring to it.  So part of the cost of the card is you have to face another encounter card.  Note that enemies or locations that cannot have attachments are not eligible and you keep flipping.

Guarded is harsh. Specially solo

Wiglaf with stallion and ancestral armor: quest for 3 and ready during questing. Defend for 4, ready with second attachment, attack for 3. Pretty good. 

 

Wild stallion on guardian of esgaroth he becomes a 3 3 3.  Not sure if paying 4 for him is worth it in that case...

South away and hidden way do not play great with haldan, they have synergy but both work against his ability to not exhaust to quest with an active location with an attachment.

What do you think of Flight of the Eagles guys? It looks good to me. You can combo it with the 1 resource Eagle for optimal cost. At the same time you are not always guaranteed to take your ally. Right?

Glamdring looks great, especially with lore. Not having to run tactics in a haldir deck is awesome. 

Having some  experience with arkenstone now, it is amazing, but a lot of times it sits in my hand because I just can't afford the extra encounter card.  Glamdring will have similar problems

Eagle support (ignore pun) is pretty cool, I just really wish tactics was more viable for card draw. Dale, dwarves, silvan, and noldor all run so smoothly and have great draw ad resource acceleration,  eagles just stall too much for my taste, I hope there is some attachment waiting in the wings (ignore pun) that really helps this archetype

Doomed works better in solo and this works better in multiplayer.  I think it’s a thematic win and really like it.  And I say that as a mostly solo player.

I probably won't be playing any Guarded player card anytime soon. It's really not worth the cost of an extra encounter card. Most of the time, the encounter deck hits you hard and fast, and the first few turns are critical. Do you really want to play a card that will bring into play an extra encounter card?

I mean, an extra encounter card.

Ok, an extra encounter card.

Not until there's some other cards actually supporting the archetype. Maybe a Bilbo Burglar hero or something.

EDIT: I must add that if you can afford to reveal an extra encounter game by playing a Guarded card in the mid or late game, then you're probably already winning, and thus don't need the card.

Thematically, I think guarded cards are awesome. I love stuff that is so cool you consider using it even if it's not optimal. Is it a good card? No. Is it a great card? I think it adds a lot to the game to have stuff like this, so maybe.

## 20 [John Constantine on October 14, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284524-do-we-know-the-45-cards-that-have-not-yet-been-spoiled-from-roam-across-rhovanion/?do=findComment&comment=3503192)

It feels like to not be a "win more" card, it shud have been more like a trap card. You play it, it sits in the staging area until an eligible card comes out, it attaches to it, and then you can claim it by dispatching that encounter card. 

## 21 [Seastan on October 14, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284524-do-we-know-the-45-cards-that-have-not-yet-been-spoiled-from-roam-across-rhovanion/?do=findComment&comment=3503212)

Guarded cards aren't going to go in every deck. And in most decks, I do think they'll be win-more. But in some decks they'll be legitimately good: 

In a Leadership Eomer deck, you can put out a guarded card and if an enemy ends up guarding it, he kills it before it ever contributes any threat or makes any attacks. For a card like the Necklace of Girion, it then makes him a better quester and pays for his ability the rest of the game. Orcrist is also great on him, making it easier to kill enemies in 1 hit and recouping the cost of the ability.

If you have Henamarth or scrying effect, you can play your guarded card right when a card with Surge was about to come out, avoiding the "extra encounter card".

In an Elladan deck, Orcrist and Glamdring turn him into a machine with limitless attack and crazy card draw, potentially worth whatever setup costs might be involved, particularly in multiplayer.

I disagree. There is some dommed cards that work better in solo like Grima and steward of Orthanc but the main doomed cards (legacy of numenor, deep knowledge, The Wizards's Voice, the seeing-stone) are way more stronger in multiplayer. I think that they even make the game unbalanced in favor of players. I dedicated the major part of my wins in multiplayer against the most difficult nightmares to them.

Guarded cards are quite special. There is many condition to make them optimal in a decklist, and it is often a proof than the deck itself is not that good and need that gambling.

I'm not too put off by the "extra encounter card", but I play Dunedain Hunter frequently.  Yes, you get an extra location or enemy, but at a time you choose -- and the card is *added* to the staging area, so surgers or "When revealed" or Ambush aren't a problem -- and while finding the guarder, treacheries and can't attach enemies (those are generally the worst) are skipped.  Glamdring's worth the cost if you have a hero attacker and love card draw.

Ancestral Armor is expensive, but I love +2 def/+2 hp on a dedicated defender and Leadership/Noble character covers a *lot* of dedicated defenders.

Wild Stallion is clever, though 2 cost for +1/+1/+1/+1 you would want on a readying ally.  It's interesting that you can play it in advance.  Radagast can pay for it, though because it's restricted it won't work on Eagles.

It's too bad South Away is a Travel Action, because it'd be way more useful in the planning phase when most location attachments are played.

For solo mono Tactics I like Steward of Orthanc -- 2 willpower for 3 cost, and card draw for 1 threat when you play an event.

One other point, wild stallion can be an independent creature when it is beneficial such as sword that was broken or something like it, and then at a later point be attached to an ally. Also unless I have the rules wrong could you chump block with someone lose him or would it be like the warg counterpart where you can attach him to another ally next turn?

Expanding on my earlier point about Haldan, I suppose his deck type might require more finesse to play than is apparent at first. Instead of loading up the active with attachments, put them on a bad travel effect location in staging, so the following turn you can take advantage of the non exhaust questing and the card draw after using this turn to travel and reduce threat. 

I made a proxy to make a deck around him and I loved it but when I see these cards that feel like they are for his deck type they usually have some drawback or conflict with him. 

 

Especially hidden path.

"Flooding" is ok to certain extent because people who've already seen the old posts will not be bothered to look at the old thread and look for edits. New post bumps the thread.

At this point, the Stallion would be an attachment, so would be discarded in the same manner as one.

I have been playing the guarded necklace and I love it.  Especially in the early game.  If it draws a location, its a pass.  When it draws an enemy my threat is low enough that I can take that baddie down without a bunch of others swarming me.  Right now my wife and I are playing the saga campaign, and she has Haldir with the warrior skill.  When this glamdring comes out it will completely replace the boon one.  She will have 3 copies and her deck will be 1 card smaller.  All around goodness.  

I think the best thing about the guarded cards is that they are not just great cards at a lower cost.  They are cards so good you can't repeat even with a bigger cost.  A 2 attack lore weapon with repeatable card draw.  I can't wait.

Don't forget all the ways that exist to look at the top of the encounter deck. Check the card before dropping a guarded. Also, Shadows of the past lets you put a card back on top. You'll know exactly what it is. Of course, you're paying 2 at that point, but you'll know what you're dealing with. Might be worth it.

As a travel action, South away is great for Haldan. Any time you need to travel somewhere that doesn't have attachments (forced to, better travel effect, etc) then you move your preferred location up instead and drop your threat! The threat drop would be from the new active location since it happens at the end of the ability.
