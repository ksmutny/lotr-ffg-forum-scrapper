So how this card works?

 

Does it add Bilbo`s stats to chosen charecter`s stats, or does this card change chosen charecter`s stats to Bilbo`s stats?

 

Can someone answer me quickly  :blink: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_blink.png]

It is 'add'

 

For example, Aragorn attacks and he has 3 attack points. If you use this event and Bilbo has 1 attack point, then Aragorn will attack with 4 attack points finally.

 

PD: if Bilbo has attached Sting, then he has 2 attack, defense and willpower points. And if he has attached Mithril he has 3wp points. Not bad then.
