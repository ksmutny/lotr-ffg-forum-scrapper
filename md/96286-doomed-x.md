Will the abilities of the allies that are connected to Doom x trigger from revealed cards in the encounter deck or just player cards that have the keyword?

Can't see any reason they won't trigger off both player cards and encounter cards.

After looking at some of the player cards they all say " after you raise your threat from the doomed keyword, x happens"

If the designers intended it to be anytime the doomed keyword triggers why not say " after the your threat is raised from the doomed keyword, x happens"

"You raise your threat" sort of implies that you were the reason your threat was raised, so I am starting to think these types of player cards only trigger when "you" raise your threat through the action of a player card.

I could be wrong. Are there other cards like this that use "you" that can be compared. I'm wondering if this will need an official response, or maybe I am overthiking it.

I have a hunch that you are over thinking it.  They could have used a new keyword that also raised the players threat but didn't so I think that event cards work as well.  Also, we'll probably see some Doomed cancellation in the cycle and they don't want you double dipping.  I.e. canceling the threat raise and still taking advantage of the Doomed trigger.

I see the distinction you are drawing here - looking at some older cards, wordings seem to be a little haphazard.

 

Elfhelm "After your threat is raised"

Song of Earendil "After another player raises his threat"

 

So I don't _think_ the designers are introducing a distinction between "raising your threat" (by your own cards/actions) and "your threat being raised" (by the encounter deck/end of turn effect).

I followed up on this just in case, so I had to ask. Here is the answer.

If you raise your threat for the doomed keyword, whether from a player card or encounter card, you have still raised your threat for the doomed keyword. Thus any effect that triggers "after you raise your threat from the doomed keyword" will trigger, regardless of the source of the doomed keyword.

Cheers,
