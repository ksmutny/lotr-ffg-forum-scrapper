I just played Escape from Dol Guldur for the first time in 4 years, and got beaten badly. 

To cheer myself up (and give myself ideas for my next attempt), I watched the new[er] Progression Series video for that quest.  I'd already watched the original CotR video back in 2014, and it was great to watch Mitch and Matthew tackling it again in the new series.  I thoroughly enjoy their videos!!!

However, I see that there haven't been any more videos since Nov 2017 (The Long Dark).  Does this mean the series is on hiatus?  Or even cancelled?  And did the December announcement of the digital version have anything to do with that?

What are the chances that we will see the Progression Series resume again?

The new Progression Series sort of faded around then. Mitch talks about why here: https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/222467-the-lord-of-the-rings-the-card-game-progression-series-the-hive-tyrant/?page=4

I doubt (but desperately hope) it will continue.
