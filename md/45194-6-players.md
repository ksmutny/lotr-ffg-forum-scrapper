# [6 players?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45194-6-players/)

Hello!

First, please excuse my english, because its not my main language.

Our playing group consists of 6 persons. I´ve read the description of the game which says, that you can play it up to four players with two core sets. 

Does anybody know, if it is possible to play he game with six persons. How many core sets do you need, if you want to do so? 1, 2, or 3? How many adventure packs are necessary?

Thank you for your answers happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]

There are 12 heroes in the core set. At least for now, it seems that most decks will be built around having three heroes, so that's 18 needed for 6 players. If they release one new hero per chapter pack, then once the first cycle is complete, you'd have exactly 18 heroes. My guess would be that you'd need quite a lot of duplication in your decks. Also, sections of the game could get wildly unpredictable, like the phase which makes you draw one card per player (I forget the name, I've onyl watched videos twice)

So maybe it might work, but to have-full strength decks you'll need to wait 6 months or so, and it'll be quite a while before you can get much variety in there.

I think you would be better off playing two simultaneous three-player games.

Hello,

I do not think this game scales well beyond 4 players.  Even the text that it can be played by 3-4 players with 2 coresets is a little bit stretched. Why?

Because this game is about efficient management of resources to achieve a goal. And the FUN of this game is based on scarcity of resources. If the power of the playing group visibly surpasses the threat they encounter the fun will quickly disappear. And the growth of threat in this game is linear with the number of players. So in my opinion each time you add a player to the game, the chance You will win rises noticeably. And what is the reason to play if you cannot loose?

I would suggest your group to buy 2 core sets and play simultaneously 2 three-player games. It would give you some competition and in the same time did not break the game.

Or three simultaneous two player games. Oh the match stories! Oh the player combinations! Oh the distribution of spheres!

i think that the only way to know is trying

anyway.. in six should be very difficult, six card in the staging area means muuuch threat

Actually, if the difficulty is linearly linked to the number of players it should stay CONSTANT, no matter what number of players you add. Yes, you will gain some flexibility with more players, but you will also add more unpredictability to the mix. The middle difficulty might be the same, but the deviation will surely increase. Also IIRC, there are cards harming all players, no matter how many. So all in all I think that the game will be slightly more difficult with more players, and it will be far more chaotic.

On the contrary.

2 more players means 6 more heroes and 2 more cards in the staging area per round + 2 cards from setup. Of these heroes everyone gets its resources. So in my opinion You can succesfully quest from the round one, and if the  game wants you to do something specific to advance you will have enough resources to do it.

But i think we strayed too far from the initial question. All heroes are unique. So it does not matter how many core sets one has - all that mattters is that there are 12 heroes. Playing 6 player game - in which every player controls 2 heroes would be a completely different beast - You will encounter 6 player adventure with resources of 4 player game.

You could always make overlays to create alternate versions of heroes.  Bizarro Gimli! Bizaragorn.  BIZARRO!

Well of course we'll have to try for a nine player fellowship some day.

We all know fellowships of nine ALWAYS stick together ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

Sign me up for the Fellowship of Nine game. Now, will I be the one that gets shot with 100 arrows or the one who alerts the goblins to our presence in Moria. Decisions, decisions...

9 player game with one hero each, anyone? Talk about Nightmare variant.

How long do we think it'll be before all 9 of the Fellowship are available as playable heroes? (I'm assuming they won't do anything cruel like making some of them allies)

## 14 [qwertyuiop on April 14, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45194-6-players/?do=findComment&comment=453690)

 Pippin's threat should only apply when determining if an enemy can engage a player. lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif]

That would be incredibly cruel if they made one of the fellowship members an Ally.

Oops, they already did. Gandalf.

Too bad, I would like a three player game with each player using three heroes of the fellowship.

I think maybe we're underestimating allies. I mean, look at Radagast, you're going to want to keep him in play for a long time after you play him, he generates resouces and everything. And look at Haldir 4/2/2/2/3 he's as good as any hero! Better than some. Having someone as an ally makes them MORE versatile in a way than a hero, and you can have multiple copies of ones you really like in your deck, so they can be in play very frequently. I think we need to change our view of allies as less than.

Definitely lots of potential for an Ally who's in play- but getting them into play is tricky. As someone pointed out above, Core Set Gandlaf already prevents us from building towards a 3-player, 3-hero-each fellowship game. I hope that we're not going to be even more hamstrung and relying on lots of Hobbit-search cards to get Merry and Pippin out there too.

I like Bohemonds idea of getting two seperate games going.  Because it's a co-op game, you could have two teams competing against each other doing the same scenarios, if you have two core sets.  The customized decks would be different, so it could get pretty interesting that way!
