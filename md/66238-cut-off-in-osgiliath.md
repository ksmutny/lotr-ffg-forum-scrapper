Hi, just a quick question. Got Massing at Osgiliath yesterday, enjoying the game very much. With the "cut off" card it says discard all ally cards in your hand. Does my "hand" include all the allies i have in play as well as those i have in my hand waiting to go in?

by the sounds of that i would say only in your hand, as it doesnt say 'in play'

Â 

"Your hand" is quite literally the cards that you are holding in your hand, waiting to see play. Anything already in play is not in your hand.
