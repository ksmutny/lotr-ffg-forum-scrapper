Playing the Fords of Isen, and I added To the sea, to the sea! to my deck and simply discarded most of my hand at the end of each planning phase (because of the stupid effects this quest has if your hand has more than two cards in it). 

So my first question is- valid or not? I don’t see anything that says you have to actually play a Noldor ally after discarding, just that the cost of the next one played is decreased by one for each card you discard.

My other question is that it doesn’t say the cost of the next Noldor ally YOU play is decreased, just “the next Noldor ally played this phase”. So can you use it to decrease the cost of an ally played from another deck?

Yes it's correct, just remember to activate it before it's the other deck turn to play allies.

Yes, totally legit. It is a very powerful card with added value in multiplayer when decks are built in coordiantion.
