Hi.

I'm not sure i play that right and i'd like to get your advice.

 

exemple:

If i have 3 card in the staging area.  2 spiders and a location.

i have 3 heros and no ally.

i already use 2 hero to quest so i only have 1 left.

2 spiders attack me and left the staging area.

2 spiders and only hero to defend myself.

i  put my hero in defense mode.

the first spider attack and i succesfully defend myself.

so...

what's the action for the second spider? 

How i see that, i act like the 2 spiders attack the same hero.  So the second spider attack again my hero.

Am i correct?

 The Second Spider's attack goes undefended and you have to assign full damage on to one of your heroes.

Remember that you must exhaust a character to defend. If you already exhausted your only ready character to defend one attack, you have no way to defend the second. Therefore, it goes undefended and all damage from it must be placed on one of your heroes.
