Naturally this applies to the lore equivalent of the card not finding a location. We always played that if you didn't find an enemy it was a free reduction of one revealed encounter card. Is that right? Or does the fact that the initial sentence doesn't resolve mean the next sentence is negated.

There is a "then" connecting the two sentences, so if you do not resolve the first the second doesn't apply.
