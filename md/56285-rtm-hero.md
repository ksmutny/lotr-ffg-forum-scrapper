So do we have a pretty definitive answer on who the hero is in Return to Mirkwood - and any details on him or her?  The context of the earlier threads regarding Dain confused me as to whether Dain is the 2nd Dwarf in KD or the hero in RtM.  The original reference mentioned that the information was found on the French forums.  Unfortunately I don't know where to find the French forums and my French is pretty much limited to Where are the Bathrooms? and Who is the cute blonde lady over there?

If someone can clarify, please do!

New Hero for Mirkwood cycle is Dain II Ironfoot (11/1/2/3/5); while he is standing, all other dwarves have +1 will and +1 Atk.

Thanks Fishiste.  I'm suprised they went with Dain right before the two Dwarves in KD.  I guess they decided to really go loaded for bear with the Dwarves.  Dain certainly makes a heavy Dwarf deck powerful!  Very solid stats and real nice buffs for his fellow dwarves.  Easier to quest Thalin for his power when he is a 2 will.  Dwarf allies will get quite a bump too!

To what sphere does he belong?

And does he effect all dwarven characters, or all dwarven heroes?

He's Leadership.

It works on Dwarf characters.

Wow...I just realized that you did not say Your Dwarf characters.  If this is true, he makes other players' dwarves more powerful too.  Pretty strong!

I was wondering where did you get the information about this card?
