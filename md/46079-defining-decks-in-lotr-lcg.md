 It struck me that there's been a bit of talk about whether the game is too easy, too difficult and so on and one of the issues is that I'm never sure what the deck construction is. It seems to me that it would be handy to be specific about what type of deck we're talking about.

Starter deck. One of the single sphere decks straight from a single core set. 30 cards, 1 Gandalf.

Limited Tournament deck. A deck with 50 cards minumim and a maximum of 3 cards with the same name built from just a single core set.

Unlimited Tournament deck. as limited but built from multiple card sets. 

Casual deck: deck built out of any number of core sets with no deck size minimum or maximum number of cards. For example I get the nagging feeling that some people might be taking a starter deck and simply adding a bunch of Gandalfs and so on. 

From my experience so far, I wouldn't mind betting that in many cases a starter deck is about as powerful as a limited tournament deck just due to the lower deck size and lack of resource mis-matches.
