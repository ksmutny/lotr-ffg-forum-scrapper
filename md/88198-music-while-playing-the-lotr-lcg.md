Did you play of some music in the background while playing in LOTR? While playing with my group, I play music in the background for climate. I play music Two Steps From Hell and Audiomachine. 
 
What kind of music do you play or what you deem appropriate to highlight the climate?
What kind of music you will chose to specific scenarios?
 
for example I think to Druadan Forest - Rick Vanman - The Drums Of War, Steward's Fear - Assassin's Creed 3 Soundtrack - Trouble In Town.

Blind Guardian, mostly from the album Nightfall in Middle Earth.

indeed, the same as you mr.thomasschmidt- when i do play music to gaming, it is the trilogy music. my favourite pieces are journey in the dark, the ring goes south and the council of elrond

@rich Uh, nice pieces those :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] Some of my favourites together with The Shire, Rohan, and the first track which I can't remember the name on. Oh, and the one where they flee for the bridge with the Balrog after them.

I also listen to all the Howard Shore albums (including the new Hobbit one) whenever I decide to play with music.  However, I did deviate by playing Pirates of the Caribbean music with the quest Peril in Pelargir because that is a decidedly pirate-y quest!

i usually just put on a pandora radio station.  not very thematic, but just having some kind of music helps the experience; especially when playing solo

hanz zimmmer has some atmospheric pieces that go well with the game.

I love Hans Zimmer scores, and the Howard Shore trilogy+Hobbit scores. Some great stuff there. I actually tend to listen to The Dark Knight Rises when i'm trying to solve complex problems at work. Plus then there are Bear McCreary's great BSG scores, and Michael Giacchino's Lost and Star Trek scores. Soundtracks like these are the new classical music.

good idea Karlson - Theme song from Pirates Of The Caribbean made great background to Peril in Pelargir.

> Blind Guardian, mostly from the album Nightfall in Middle Earth.

I checked a few songs Blind Guardians on youtube and... i don't think this is good music at background to LOTR. 

More distracting than building atmosphere, but a matter of taste. and the point is not that this is a metal - metal I listen to myself privately ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

music from game LOTR Online is also good as the background.

While I'm playing I also quite often listen to the Borgen soundtrack by Halfdan E.

This is a nice topic, interesting to hear from everybody. Myself I prefer to listen to the Full Scores of Lotr and the Hobbit Score. I can imagine Hans Zimmer to be very fitting too. Personally, I prefer some thematic sound rather than modern music to go with my game. But I really like the idea of listening to Pirates Soundtrack for the Pelargir quest! ;-)

for truely atmospheric listening i listen to Sigur Ros. i was introduced to them by a friend about a year ago and have a true obsession with them, have seen them live and own just about everything they have produced.

 

for those wanting a true epic sound try listening to 'svefn-g-englar' whilst questing.....especially in mountainous areas (this is what it makes me imagine....funnily enough because the first time i heard it i was watching a fan made video of lotro ered luin area)

Assassins creed was definitely a good choice for Steward's Fear, it has a great mysterious atmosphere. I also liked the Da Vinci Code Soundtrak by Zimmer. I listen to the Apocolypto soundtrack for Druadan Forest, it has some great tribal drums and chanting.

Mostly Blind Guardian , either "nightfall in middle earth" (my sig is about Fingolfin from the song Time Stands Still At The Iron Hill) or "somewhere far beyond", especially the two Bard Songs.

Then it could be Howard Shore albums for the movies which I love.

Da Vinci Soundtrack has mysterious atmosphere - good choice for Stewards Fear. That same Apocalypto for Druadan Forest - great drums for this scenario. 

And what kind of music would you choose to Mirkwood area?

You know, I really couldn't say. There isn't anything that pops into my head! Exactly for this reason, I can't wait to hear what Howard Shore does for the Desolation of Smaug soundtrack. It's an interesting area of Middle Earth because it can be both Elven and dangerous/evil at times. I need Howard Shore to tell me what Mirkwood sounds like!

Any Howard Shore songs would be the songs I listen to. My favorite song to listen to when playing this game is one called either The Lighting of the Beacons or The White Tree. Can't remember which one. But especially when you're on the last stage and a battle's raging, and you hear the battle portion of that song. So amazing!

List me with the others who listen to the Howard Shore LotR/Hobbit soundtracks.

 

I have a mega playlist that includes the Complete Recordings versions of the 3 LotR extended movie soundtracks, The Hobbit soundtrack and the Rarities Archive CD that came with The Music of the Lord of the Rings book.

 

I know some people don't like the movies compared to the books, but everything about the music is nothing short of perfect, in my opinion.

 

Great, GREAT stuff.

Sometimes, I play rock music whilst I play. Other times, I have a playlist of soundtrack music for series from "The Lord of the Rings," "Narnia," "Star Wars," and "Doctor Who" that I use for gaming in general. It makes the game more epic. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I find the Howard Shore scores a bit too saccharine for my taste, especially the accompanying music to anything involving Elves is a bit too organic tea elevator for me.

 

Recently got hold of a vinyl copy of Bo Hansson's score for the animated LotR movie from the '70s. Partially suffers from the same problem, but The Black Riders and The Grey Havens in particular are great tunes.

I enjoy the LotR and Hobbit scores by Shore, of course. Two Steps from Hell certainly is epic, but I mostly require something less intense in order to relax and focus. There is a very talented Swiss composer called Adrian von Ziegler who makes a lot of Celtic and relaxing music. He's on Youtube and iTunes, I highly recommend his songs!

Bo Hansson's album was not composed for or used in Bakshi's LOTR. It is a very good album nonetheless.

 

I love playing while listening to the Conan movie soundtrack (yes, the one with Schwarzenegger). I consider it one of the best soundtracks of all time, and it goes well with the game.

Hmm, usualy it's Howard Shore. 
But, sometimes, I add WoW OST's and some Two Steps from Hell. I suspose these two maybe aren't the best choices but they work very epic-awesome for me  :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Ensiferum   "In My Sword I Trust" - recently, is a "HIT" at our sessions - has put players in fighting mood - funny when players began singing the chorus: "Rise my brothers we are blessed to steel 
In my sword I trust! " - during the combat phase  :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

works great especially in the Siege Of Cair Andros, but we let play of this song at every scenario  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

recently I decided to enter the "introduction" to the world of game for the climate. Before we sit down to play ( we play campaigns - once I wrote about it) I  show  video to  the players, some atmospheric  introduction to Middle-Earth - excellent idea especially for the introduction of new players. my players liked that kind of the introduction - for each game, I will try to find a new one.

 

 For example, something like that:

 





 

or to the saga of The Hobbit:

I've recently played the old Zeppelin songs with Tolkien lyrics-and many other Zeppelin songs in general-as I used to do when I was younger (though not while playing this game), and it has been great.

 

But mainly I use to play Howard Shore tunes nowadays.

Obviously Howard Shore has a lot to offer when it comes to Middle-Earth. His music is now practically "canon level accepted" as the soundtrack of ME. To agree with Narsil though, AC is very good with Steward's Fear.

Bo Hansson's album - Lord of The Rings. He is a Swedish musician, inspired by LOTR and wrote an entire album in 70's based on the novel. It's only instrumental and it's epic!
