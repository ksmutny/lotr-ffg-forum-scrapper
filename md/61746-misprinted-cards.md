 Hey everybody. I was just doing a little deck building and was looking through my second core set and noticed that some of my cards were misprinted (off center, cut off). Is there anything I can do about it? Would I have to return it and get a new one or does FFG do anything for that?

 I've had a couple misprinted/miscut cards for some of FFG's other games and they replaced them. Just contact them through the 'User Support' Customer Service link at the bottom of their webpages.

FFG has always been really good with that.

 Ahh, okay, I already contacted them, so hopefully they'll get back to me with similar results. It's just rather troubling to buy a second core set for a few cards and having them wind up off centered and crummy looking, lol. Thanks!
