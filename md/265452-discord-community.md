Those interested in live discussion about the new digital game from FFI are welcome over on the Cardboard of the Rings Discord server! https://discord.gg/n2CdNsj [https://discord.gg/n2CdNsj]

The server is mainly for the physical card game, but we have opened up a dedicated channel for the digital version.

Unfortunately I had to shut down that link because it was being used by spammers. Here's a new link: https://discord.gg/n2CdNsj [https://discord.gg/n2CdNsj]

If that expires as well, just leave a reply here and ask for a new one.
