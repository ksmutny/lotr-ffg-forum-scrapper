Hey there,

I was looking at cards to come, and was wondering wether Honour guard 1st ability would work on Beorn (hero) :

It is the damage that is targeted for me. But everything around immunity is kind of strangely ruled, so I'd rather have some clear answers from rules experts out here ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

Yep, it would work with Beorn.  It works in the same way as Dori.

****... Beorn with a couple of Honor Guards would become a damage sponge at valor levels...

Might need to build a "sponge" deck.. featuring Beorn & Treebeard... Honour guard's, Dori, lots of healing...

New question with appearing of dori hero.

Would Dori hero would work with Beorn hero as dori's ability is targeting the defense value and not the hero.

I guess it is not working but I rather ask and have a clear answer.

I'm sure they were referring to Dory the ally.

No, Dori hero does not work with Beorn. That would give Dori a case where he can be marginally useful, and we can't have that!
