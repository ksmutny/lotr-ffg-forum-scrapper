Gurus,

Am I missing it in the rules somewhere? I have read rulebook front to back and the online faq/errata and can not find any discussion of solo, 3 or 4 player setup or game play (besides one line that says, " Up to four players can play the game cooperatively with a second copy of the core set.") Why are 2 copies of the core set necessary? Do you combine Encounter decks? Do you need second set just for extra Threat Trackers? Any direction toward rules for solo and/or 3-4 player would be greatly appreciated :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Each player needs their own deck, and each player needs a threat tracker. While you get the four decks, you only get two threat trackers (most players I know just use dice for 3 and 4 players) and enough tokens in the box for a max of two players.

Love LLC system concept; complete set of cards with expansions. But with all four LLC games Fantasy flight still has occasional needs to buy more than one for complete decks, etc. It seems crazy to me to have a base set with four decks included but to make you buy another set just for a few extra punch out tokens? Also you would need to buy three core sets if you wanted 3 of every card for tournament decks even though most of the single cards in core set cost 5 or more resources. So no written documentation on solo, 3-4 player setup/game play?

Peace

solo play is the same as 2 player, only you are on your own- 1 deck of attachments/allys etc, 3 heros, and 1 encounter deck.

 I'm not sure what you mean by no written documentation.  The rules say what each player needs to play, and a lot of the game effects are per player, etc.  Obviously there's nothing magical about the cardboard tokens or the threat meters, use whatever you have on hand if you need more.

You don't combine encounter decks. You just draw more cards from the regular encounter deck (one per player). This also scales down nicely when you have only one player, although the very early turns are extra tough with one player in some scenarios (fixed number of threat-causing cards in staging).

About there not being enough cards: This is always brought up, and the answer is always that the core set would be really darn expensive if they had piles upon piles of cards. The expansions are supposed to fix the number of cards, and clearly the core set IS for two players since you can't make more than two tournament decks with it :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

FFG have play-tested it and found it good for 1-4 players, and the core box doesn't require you to follow tournament deckbuilding rules then. You're never forced to buy another core set, as they've balanced the core scenarios around the included contents. The rulebook says it's a 1-2 player game, optionally up to 4 players with an extra core set. That's the keyword to use: "optional". I personally think 6 heroes is already a large enough party. I mean, who decides where to go and when to stop? I find it hard enough deciding on places to go or movies to watch when just out with TWO friends!
