In the setup of several parts of the quest it says "Each player searches the encounter deck and discard pile for 1 different Dunland enemy and adds it to the staging area." Different means different types of enemy right? So you can't do 2 berserkers for example? Just want to make sure I'm not being too literal with the cards.

That's how I understood it.
