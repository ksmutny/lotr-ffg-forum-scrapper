I couldhave sworn there was a card to travel to any location in the staging... I know striders path but that has a condition that u need to reveal the card from the deck. Isn't there another simuler card that dose not have that condition.. I can not seam to find it but i was sure it was there... any ideas?

Hi there,

Strider's Path put aside, the only one I think of, which seems close to your needs, is:

West Road Traveller (Return to Mirkwood, #121)
Type: Ally
Sphere: [spirit]
Cost: 2, Will.: 2, Att.: 0, Def.: 0, Hit Pts.: 1

Rohan.
Response: After you play West Road Traveller from your hand, switch the active location with any other location in the staging area.
