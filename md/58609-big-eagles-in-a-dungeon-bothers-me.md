So, I don't see any reason not to still take eagle allies through Moria but doesn't it seem odd?  I was wondering if they were going to make a rule where winged creatures can't go underground, but so far I haven't seen anything like this.  Am I missing something, or am I just over thinking this?

mmmmmm....methinks that not too many players are that focused on theme to be worried about this, i dont see fantasy flight limiting what can go where, i.e. if/when lorien comes up - dwarves being allowed in the forest despite loriens rules against this,

 

i think i personally will try and stick true to theme though

Does anyone else think they made a mistake with the eagle trait.  In Rhosgobel the eagle trait appears to substitute for the ability to fly.  But surely there will be other creatures that are allies that can fly and if you play Rhosgobel will they be unable to defend against the monsters that require and eagle or ranged?

 

I wish eagles were given a flying trait instead.  Then enemies could also be given the flying trait and flying enemies can only be attacked of defended against by allies with the flying trait or ranged ability.

 

Anyways not to thread jack but your post made me remember this concern.  To put it back on track then creatures with the flying trait could be potentially restricted from certain quests by text on a quest card.

I've been wondering about that myself. I don't think you're overthinking it, but I think there will be some APs in the cycle that are not set completely underground for example the one where the party travels to the Gates and also maybe the one where they come out the other side of Moria. I don't really kow I'm just noodling Ideas around.:) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

on that note i wonder why eagles werent held back for this up coming cycle instead of mirkwood, i know the whole rhosgobel thing, but it seems like a radom addition to mirkwood, and it would thematicly fit a lot better to the mountains

I think that is a good point. by using "eagle"in teh card text they have basically limited it ot a single tribe... and as you say.. if they ever get new flying creatures it will seam silly that only eagels can do certin thing. I guess Journey will still have people playing archer decks. I think this could be a problem with LoTR in general though. While LoTR is fantasy, it is not a wild and crazy as modern fantasy is, meaning I often wounder about how many things they can really add to this game. I mean almost all the races are already represented. You just can not add mounted drakes for the good guys or w.e

Personally, I think you are overthinking this. It also doesn't make much sense that you can make Frodo the Steward of Gondor, or that somebody wields two Plate Armors, or that ranged characters get the bonus from Dwarven Axe (are they throwing the axe or what?). After all, it's just a game, and the theme only gets so far. If something comes up that doesn't really make sense, I smile at it and simply play on (I remember having great fun when I enchanted a Stone Wall with Lightning Reflexes in M:tG).

But it's your game after all, so if you are bothered, just leave the eagles on the bench for the Moria quests.

good point there......i think we can all remember daft scenarios like those you said, i can jsut picture poor old bilbo dragging along two large heavy axes.....anyways i think we all have different boundries, i usually make a deck to win a scenario for the first time that has no theme at all- so theyll see action there, but for other times theme takes over and i think ill leave them out

If you think that's bad, in the CoC LCG I have faced Great Cthulhu with two tommyguns and riding a motorcycle! Sometimes you just have to go with the flow.

You will find stuff that doesn't make sense in just about every card game. A huge monster riding a tiny vehicle, someone wielding a title they would never be eligible for, in Warhammer: Swarm of Bats equipped with Choppa, which is a huge orc axe. Think of it as watching a movie: sometimes you must suspend belief in order to enjoy what's going on. If you overthink it and allow thematics to override practicality, then the game becomes no fun. The Frodo/Steward example was great. By this way of thinking, we could only attach it to Denethor.

If eagles in the dungeon bother someone, than what about the following situation which happens in almost EVERY game? You find a new armor and it ALWAYS fits you perfectly. No matter if you are man or woman, big or small, dwarf or giant, the armor will suit you. How is it possible that one man will kill thousands of bandits, dragons and rats during his life? Why there is a chest that you can loot in every dungeon? How does it happen that for every peaceful civilian there are at least 1 hundred of villains that you need to kill? And why everyone keeps giving you quests like fetch/kill and I'll pay you my whole monthly salary?

Those are only games, not a real life. Sometimes people forget and then we can read in newspaper about some nerds who try to rob a store using a lightsaber and jedi powers.

Even if there was a list of rules what is allowed and what is not (like eagles in dungeon), the list would be huge and no sane person would like to play the game. Just think about it, horses can't go into dugenon, so riddermark finnest are out. But wait, price imrahil too! And west road traveller! Wounded Gimli should not be able to wear Citadel plate, it is way too heavy for wounded character, on the verge of death. We would need a list of characters able to wield a sword and fight with it (it requires a lot of time to learn and you need to be quite strong). It means a lot of allies and hero's should not be able to do it. We would need another lists for axes, spears, shields etc. We would need a parameter saying how big the head is for every character, because not every helmet should fit....

i think everyone has their themetic limits.....me personally....whenever i draw horn of gondor and have boromir in the game, it will always get put on him, no matter if it would be suited somewhere else, like wise citadel plate will go on him too (i know this is a good move anyways, makign him a bit of a tank), but the point is that it would end up impossible as stated above if i thought..wait a minute, boromir cant go into moria, because in TFOTR it was his first time, or how would frodo go through mirkwood.....but i still see durinIII point, if you want a thematic game, you may want to draw your own boundries o what is realistic and what isnt....but i now ramble....

Yeah, I probably should have never brought it up, but for some reason this is the first time (despite all the other good examples listed by you guys) that I stopped to think about the "literal" issues.  Overall I am not too bothered by it, and you guys are right; this happens in any game.

if you could get 'em to go in there i think eagles would be pretty handy in moria, got a large chasm? just hop on and fly over it........you also dont need to worry about falling off the bridge of khazad dum anymore

I had the same feeling, in fact it's even worse for me because horses also should not gon to the Moria (as in the film in fact ), this means deckbuilding strategy lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif]

After if the scenarios are really too hard, I will probably integrate them ...

 When they walk, being eagles, they probably walk slow, but when they fly in those open areas, then they really soar!!!  Go for it, and may many an Orc die by the talons of a swift eagle ready to strike!
