Can you send a team-minded character in the middle of the battle, taking all the enemy archery damage, while your other characters remain unscathed?

In other words, might all 10 archery damage for a round be assigned to the Envoy of Pelagir? If not, then if one card has Archery X, where X turns out to be 4, would she at least be able to soak up all that damage? Or does each damage happen individually?

i am almost certain in saying that each damage must happen….so you can sacrifice one low cost ally and get rid of the rest of the damage. once an ally dies, the rest must be assigned

yar… resolve each point individually.  The splash damage  from the Cave-troll [http://lotrlcg.com/pages/cardFocus.php?Card_Key=1305] was confirmed to work the same way.
