Hey guys,

I am relatively new to the game, been playing for about 4 months now and absolutely loving it. I just started figuring out OCTGN and playing with some of my friends on there, but I was hoping to find a gaming group who plays on OCTGN so I can play a little more frequently. Anyone know of such an organization?

Also, I've been listening to and enjoying the Cardboard of the Rings podcast, starting way back at the beginning, and in episode 11 they mention another podcast, Fellowship of the Cards, that focuses more on the lore and narrative associated with all the cards. This sounds like something right up my alley, so I thought I would check it out, only to discover it seems to be missing and all the links to it no longer work. Does anyone happen to have this podcast downloaded and might be able to host some files so I might acquire it, or know a place you can still get them?

Thanks so much everyone!
