 Can someone explain me this step I understand all other basic rules. 

How can I explore "active location" during travel? Is that travel mean that I can put  redy charchter to explore that location with willpower during travel phase  or what, how that funcionate?

 Travel is nothing more than moving a location from staging to "active location". Unless there is some card effect stating otherwise, no progress tokens are placed during travel phase. It will not be till the next round during the questing phase that characters will be committed and all that.

 Correct. It also means that you don't count the threat of the active location during questing.
