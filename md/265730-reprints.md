Now that the digital card game is on its way I’m noticing a renewed interest in the physical  card game.  I’m hoping FFG sees this opportunity and gets the reprints going more frequently and in more quantity.  I’m still seeing expansions that have been “awaiting reprint” since springtime.  I think they would miss out on the chance to sell even more cards.  My experience personally is that it’s darn near impossible to get many expansions as FLGS and online sites as they seem to sell out fairly quickly.

Seconded

## 3 [Nohwear on December 19, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/265730-reprints/?do=findComment&comment=3133262)

I am just starting to get into this game, so yes please!

The expansions get steadily reprinted. I thik the delays and out-of-stock periods are more a result of the logistic difficulties of having products printed and then shipped to the other side of the world. Boat shipping is the most ecological and cheap but also literally 1-2months. That is if all goes well.

My guess is FFG will reprint as long as people keep buying. Why retire a product that's making money? The digital game (it's not the same game) may be leading more people to the LCg as well. Which will then create more out-of-stock problems ... 

## 5 [kdlittle88 on December 22, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/265730-reprints/?do=findComment&comment=3138896)

Except one of the expansions I’m thinking of has been “awaiting reprint” since May.  That’s not shipping time, that’s “we’re still thinking if we are gonna reprint this at all” time.

Seriously though, I totally agree with you. There's so many out of stock items including ALL of the Saga's. Many of the first several cycles of Adventure packs are also out of stock.. Yeah they're printing more but not fast enough. Their printers may be that limited but for a game that is so "healthy and alive" it seems silly to not have it well stocked unless it is beyond their printing capabilities. I can imagine lots of lost money from expansions people can't buy just because it's out of stock.

I used to buy expansions from Amazon, Ebay and/or Coolstuffinc since I got into the game a couple years after it's release. It was pretty easy to find and buy many expansions for less than retail and also with free shipping etc. But now every site has limits and much of the game is out of stock making it super difficult to catch up or simply buy expansions that look fun to a player if they're not the most recent.

So to the OP yes the digital game should bring interest to the physical but with so much out of print and a full collection easily costing $1000 many will just opt to play the digital. Please FFG keep up with the reprints so people can actually buy and play this amazing game!!

## 7 [lotrfan123 on December 25, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/265730-reprints/?do=findComment&comment=3142343)

Oh God yes please. Now I don't know about you guys, but I live in Slovenia, which is a small country in cental Europe and we have only one shop in the hole country where I can buy this kind of games. I have ordered 1 saga and 1 deluxe expansion more than a year ago!!! Back then it said it was out of stock and now it's still out of stock!!! So please this is an awsome game and I'm a huge Tolkien fan plus the game is still very much alive (as far as I know), so for the love of all that's holly make more reprints.

 

PS: I looked around at some other popular games at this moment (Game of thrones, Arkham Horror, Android: Netrunner) and everything is available. WHY :(((((

Well the good news is one of the expansions (voice of Isengard) just got updated to being “at the printer”.  Maybe they are listening after all :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I will say though while I would rather have the physical cards I’m getting frustrated at how difficult it is to collect them. I’m darn near ready to give up pursuit and just play on OCTGN.  I really hope they up the reprints cause I’d much rather have the cards...

## 11 [ArtyomTrityak on January 4, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/265730-reprints/?do=findComment&comment=3581782)

It looks like sagas and older expansions are still out of stock and no reprints 😕 That's weird. I love this game but it is so hard to find expansions.

## 12 [alcuin18 on January 4, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/265730-reprints/?do=findComment&comment=3581911)

Maybe at some point they could make older packs print-on-demand for around 5 dollars so we could at least get them in some fashion. They could be cheaper since they are not real cards but they could be legal cards for use like the print-on-demand scenarios.

## 13 [mewmartigan on January 4, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/265730-reprints/?do=findComment&comment=3582128)

I'm hoping reprints are coming and they have just slowed due to all the other new stuff FFG has going on. 

I don't trust the "upcoming" page because last year I needed the Ring Maker cycle and it showed "on the boat". Got an in stock alert from CoolStuffInc, ordered the cycle and it eventually sold out again. After it sold out, the upcoming page still had it as "on the boat".

Currently there are only 4 things "at the printer".  That seems awfully low as I know I've seen 10 or more things at a time "at the printer".

So hold out hope and set up some re-stock alerts from the stores.

## 14 [Tarliyn on January 5, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/265730-reprints/?do=findComment&comment=3582367)

I would welcome reprints.  What is currently at the printer?

## 15 [BillK62 on January 5, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/265730-reprints/?do=findComment&comment=3582379)

The FFG website is now showing Sands of Harad as being "On the Boat". I don't remember it ever showing as being "At the Printer", so maybe they're not religious about updating the queue entries.

Print on demand is not cheaper. Polish packs are printed using PoD method and are actually more expensive than normal packs in retail.

## 17 [player1683311 on January 5, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/265730-reprints/?do=findComment&comment=3582421)

Perhaps it is done somewhat purposefully, like, it is difficult to keep the whole line of FFG products in print at all times.

But by producing only a set amount, lower than the amount needed guarantees a sell out.

 

Like, people buy mondo posters because they sell them out instantly and never sell them again, and people panic. Or kickstarters that are only available as such, selling more because of the possibility of never getting it? 

 

So if you could guarantee 5000 sales, or risk 10000 reprints and only sell 7000, any business will do the first.

By deliberately shorting demand you are creating a fear and need that makes a greater sell through. There is probably a term for it, and I fine line to make the most money you can without losing sales. 

Stores around holidays always order less than they need (of holiday specific stuff) to make sure they sell it out because they dont want to be stuck with halloween product in February. 

 

Just a theory, that's all. In the end it doesnt really matter why, you all just want your packs. I get it and I'm sorry there is so much fun content you cant get and I'm sorry you are frustrated. I hope for the best for all

## 18 [dalestephenson on January 5, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/265730-reprints/?do=findComment&comment=3582470)

Sands of Harad surprises me in that it was in stock within the last six months; however it and Grey Havens are the only older cycles that have APs in stock for FFG.  I expected Dwarrowdelf cycle to be next, since KD was the last deluxe to be reprinted and it had been waiting longest (though KD is out of stock again, of course).  But there's no telling what's at the printer.  If memory serves, the Arkham Horror "Path to Carcosa" that is also on the boat as of 1/4 was not listed at the printer last month either.

## 19 [Gizlivadi on January 5, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/265730-reprints/?do=findComment&comment=3582503)

People, please ignore the Upcoming page completely. It's not only inaccurate but it actually misinforms the consumer base. At this point It's more of a detriment than anything else. 

## 20 [player1683311 on January 5, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/265730-reprints/?do=findComment&comment=3582619)

## 21 [dalestephenson on January 5, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/265730-reprints/?do=findComment&comment=3582669)

I'll grant that the Upcoming is frequently out of date, but the "last updated" at least tells us when any particular entry was correct.  I can't recall anything being inaccurate *when updated*, which would mean Sands of Harad really is on the boat.

## 22 [Tarliyn on January 6, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/265730-reprints/?do=findComment&comment=3582889)

If something says awaiting reprint what does that mean?  Is there any sort of normal timeline or is it a meaningless status?

## 23 [Authraw on January 6, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/265730-reprints/?do=findComment&comment=3582892)

At this point the page is pretty much meaningless. There used to be a more or less standard rate at which packs moved through the stages, but at this point packs come in and out of print irrespective of the Upcoming page. 

## 24 [Tarliyn on January 6, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/265730-reprints/?do=findComment&comment=3583057)

Last I checked race across harad was at my local shop. If anyone wants it let me know and I will ship it to you for cost, I wont mark up the postage or price.  You can just PayPal me as friends. If you are wondering if you can trust me I have one of the few podcasts about the game so I'm not a complete unknown in the community.

Tell that to Foundations of Stone.

I was fortunate enough to find Celebrimbor's Secret online within the last couple of months and snapped it up even though I don't have the deluxe. And yes, Galadriel is totally worth it 😊

Considering how angry the LOTR community gets when they mention a second edition I highly doubt it.  I think FFG is slowly trying to cut down on the physical version.  After all, if you play Arkham instead of this they don't have to pay royalties to anyone. 

Stinks though.  I really wish they would bring the old stuff back in stock.  Got a lot of holes in my collection I'd love to fix.  But I'm slowly losing hope for any reprints.  Especially of any old APs.  :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

I suspect a 2nd edition may see the light in the next 2 years or so. Amazon Prime developing a LotR TV series and spin-off for release around 2021 (https://www.digitaltrends.com/movies/amazon-lord-of-the-rings-series-news-cast/ [https://www.digitaltrends.com/movies/amazon-lord-of-the-rings-series-news-cast/]) would be the right time to reboot and get a new crop of players interested in playing the game. I'm sure the 60+ expansions for this game (not counting NM packs) deter many current would-be payers from getting into it, even if the back catalog were to be reprinted on a regular basis. I know that I wouldn't start collecting a game that would be as deep in expansions at the time of "discovery" as this one is. And new/shiny core sets always spark a fever in gamers (even if the cost is losing some longterm players along the way).

Just my thoughts... and all that based on the assumption FFG does continue to develop new LCGs, which is a whole other question.    

## 35 [dalestephenson on January 9, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/265730-reprints/?do=findComment&comment=3585608)

One thing is certain, when expansions are actually reprinted, players aren't deterred from snapping it up quickly.

Please, Please, Please do some reprints.  The original Mirkwood Cycle is very hard to find.  I would even support a Kickstarter.  I am just getting into the game and realize I will not be able to get going on some of the expansions.  On a side note, if anyone has advice on what adventure packs to get into at this point, let me know.

new player here as well and it is somewhat discouraging to look at the reprint schedule and see nothing for this game, and just one reprint on the boat right now with the Harad deluxe expansion.  The prices on the secondary market for older adventure packs and saga/deluxe expansions are ridiculous.

I'm in NY, I'm not trying to hunt down any particular packs with any urgency, it's more like the packs I've been able to get online seem to be limited to stuff after grey havens and then some random  earlier stuff. For example, from the mirkwood cycle it was easy to get return to mirkwood and journey to rhosgobel but none of the other packs are available online really, and I was able to track down a copy of the On the Doorstep deluxe expansion but can't find over hill and under hill, or another example is Voice of Isengard is easy to find right now but no adventure packs to be found anywhere for the ringmaker cycle.

Yeah as a new player, I'm probably just going to jump straight to Harad because all the shops I've see just have a mishmash and it's honestly going to be 

a) Just getting a whole cycle, which is pretty hard for older ones

b) Just trying to get the "best" from each.

The latter being wholly subjective to anyone and I dunno, not sure if I'm *that* invested yet.

The problem with some of us is we are completionists.  So it drives me nuts I can't get the Dwarrowdelf cycle.  That's a fun one with tons of cool player cards.  Been out of print for over a year now. 

## 44 [Ywingscum on January 10, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/265730-reprints/?do=findComment&comment=3587577)

I’ve been in the game just over a year, managed to pick up everything except 5 APs from Dwarrowdelf and the last saga box, Mountain of Fire at my local store.

I think some reprints don’t get ‘shown’ on the upcoming page.  So I would take that page with a grain of salt as far as how often things get reprinted.

Wastes of Eriador was added 5/9/2018, Dread Realm 7/9/2018.  Their corresponding deluxe was added 7/25/2018.  The only things that have been waiting longer than Wastes is the 6 Dwarrowdelf APs and two saga expansions (Mountain of Fire and On the Doorstop).  Between Wastes and Dread Realm you have three sagas (OHUH, Black Riders, Treason of Saruman) and Emyn Muil.

I really do hope they reprint some of the older cycles for the new players who prefers physical over digital. It’s really not fair having to shell out $50-$100 on evilbay for an ap.
