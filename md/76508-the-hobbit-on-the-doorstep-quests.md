Yay for mid-holiday news articles! Thanks Caleb for taking some time to let us know about the hobbit. I'm so excited about the game in 2013!

the poison and unconcious things sound interesting.

--- "Once a character has too much poison, it becomes unconscious and useless to its controller" ---

it sounds like the poison will accumulate until each character reaches their limit (maybe characters with higher will can take more poison?)

i wonder how they are going to do it. will we just put wound tokens on them? i hope it is something seperate from wound tokens.

Yeah i have that doubt to. I dont think wound tokens would do well so maybe we are going to have Poison tokens.

P.S: Happy new year to all, keep the threat of Sauron at bay ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

Super excited about these quests. The first Hobbit quests were pretty cool, but these seem off the charts. I hope they just come out with some generic "special" tokens at some point that can be used for various purposes in different quests (poison in this case, other things in other quests).

I'm liking what I'm seeing and am super-excited for this expansion!  Looks like new Bilbo will help smooth out some of the issues with treasures (hopefully).  If the Lonely Mountain has 12 threat just image what Mount Doom will have.

Mount Doom: Threat - 50, Action - Soil yourself.

That could work, or "poison tokens" could be progresstokens put on the characters.

They could then introduce "soil tokens". Lets say 10 soil tokens and your breeches give way under the strain of the poopage, rendering you exhausted for 3 turns. Hmmm i expect ffg have that one in the pipeline as we speak.

On the flip side of the argument, if it were counted as a wounding mechanism, at least there would already be healing measures in the game previously to allow a player to counter it, instead of needing to dedicate more cards from the new set just to offset the poison.
