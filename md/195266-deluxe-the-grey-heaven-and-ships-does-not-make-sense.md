Ships don't make sense? Like... the kind that are explicitly mentioned in the source material? I would understand if you were drawing the line at airplanes, but boats? This is the weirdest "the game is ending" post I've ever seen.

And just when I was trying to prove that the forums are getting better!

 

In all seriousness though, I couldn't disagree more with OP. Just because there are no ship voyages in the Hobbit or the LOTR novels (except at the end), that doesn't mean that there were no ships at all or that a seafaring adventure doesn't make sense in Middle Earth, even if we're not considering the prominence of ships in the 1st and 2nd ages. We're seeing corsair enemies, which are also in the books, and overall we know that the elves and gondorians had plety of ships so that exploring the seas of Middle Earth makes perfect sense. The fact that this cycle doesn't have anything to do with the story and setting of the novels doesn't change anything. Sorry, but you'll have to make better points for why you think that having ships in Middle Earth is "jumping the shark".

It seems that some people does not know  about Númenor, or the ancient friendship between them and the Noldor, the Undying Lands, Valinor, etc. I recommend the reading of Unfinished Tales of Númenor and Middle-earth, right now. Besides the theme of Sea was always being there, in all the books (especially LOTR). Legolas fear the sound of gulls, because he knows he will love the sea and exploring it.

Maybe it is not the best theme for some people, but if you want to arrive to the Undying Lands, like Bilbo, Gandalf, Frodo, Galadriel, Elrond, Cirdan and Sam, hey! you must build a ship and raise the sails.

I don't think OP is necessarily against boats and sea-going, per se.

 

Rather, "swashbuckling adventure on the high seas" is not something characteristically associated with Tolkien. Indeed, none of your examples contradict that feeling. It does seem an odd thing to focus an entire cycle on, and only natural for someone to think it's a sign that they're running out of ideas and grasping at straws.

 

And just because someone disagrees with the general consensus doesn't make them a troll. That's an all too easy way to convince yourself you can plug your ears and ignore their uncomfortable statements. Maybe they just have a different opinion. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I don't find it uncomfortable at all, I find it premature and baseless. I'm probably being too harsh, but someone should at least wait to play the thing before making a judgment. If you've gone this far with the game, you think you'd do that much at least. It reminds me very much of the bind that bands get into, where if they stick to their sound, everyone says, "They're just rehashing the same songs over and over again", but if they innovate and try something new, then everyone says, "Ah, they're grasping at straws, they've gone too far!". I for one expect this to be the best expansion and cycle yet. And, as I've said in other places, the saga expansions are the place for them to slavishly follow the books. The cycles are where they should allows us to play in places Tolkien never showed us directly. I for one have wished for ships and an ocean voyage for a long time.

But he is a troll. His commentaries are unconfortable because they are stupid: he shows unknowledge of the source material and he says he doesn't like ships and won't buy more and he writes a post where there's no discussion matter. He can do wathever he wants, like cleaning his ass with his card collection. For a moment, I thought there could be something interesting.

Man the ships! THIS MEANS WAR!

 

Seriously though. Sea = Tolkien. Silmarillion = Sea. Numenor = Sea. Legolas wants Sea, Gandalf wants Sea as "the end" and even tricks Pippin into wanting Sea  "That's not so bad," said Pippin. "No. No it isn't," answered Gandalf.

I don't even know why I dó take the time to explain myself...

Those ships are sort of objective cards that will only be present in the representative sea quests. If you're worrying that they'll release a non-objective ship player card, then fear not.

Except nothing in his post said anything about "swashbuckling adventure", just about ships. For that matter, the Grey Havens announcement article says nothing about swashbuckling either, so I've no idea where you got that idea from. It actually seems fairly natural to me - the Havens are one of the iconic places in Middle Earth, but nothing really happens there except for ships sailing off. So if you want to send the players there, you pretty much have to go sailing or it'll make for a very boring quest with no enemies in it.

 

I do agree that people can be too quick to cry troll. I personally don't think his opinion could be more wrong, and he didn't exactly express it in a way designed to foster interesting discussion, but I believe it's a genuine opinion.

Oh, also, we need to reset the counter - 0 days since someone made a 'The game is dying' post...

I'm still hoping they'll get around to a cycle around Thorongil's raid on Umbar.  Ships would work nicely there.

> I'm still hoping they'll get around to a cycle around Thorongil's raid on Umbar.  Ships would work nicely there.

Me too.  I didn't think we were going there, but then I noticed two of the three ships in the cycle are Gondorian.

I like that. Will have to knock up a custom Quest Deck when all is said and done: The Flood in the Deep! Ohhh, and I can make the Nameless Things servants of Cthu...I mean The Watcher. And Orcs fleeing from their burrows in the mines. And a Balrog objective ally...

 

Okay, I actually meant all of this as a bad joke but now I am totally making this when the cards come out. 

 

To the point of the thread...I get the hate but don't necessarily agree with it. 

 

I personally love the new setting. The Grey Havens are a super interesting part of the lore and are ripe ground for more exploration of the Noldor and (maybe) Silvan and Gondor traits. I do worry a little that this is going to leave some other traits that could still use some growth behind (Rohan, Hobbit and at this point maybe some Dwarf again) but the Sellsword and Sam allies seem to belay that concern.

 

Regarding theme I disagree a bit with @PocketWraith. I do think the APs are showing a real "Swashbuckling Adventure" vibe that does not necessarily resonate thematically with The Grey Havens and I can understand that bothering some. But like @John Constantine said it does thematically resonate with Umbar--a very interesting and unexplored part of Middle Earth. 

 

And, from a player perspective...I'm glad for a little bit of change. We have done a lot of mountains and caves and forests and ruins. This is different and that's good every once in a while. I can see it bothering some Tolkeen purists that want more of what we saw in the books but it isn't an issue for me. But I'm kind of a special case--I'm largely not here for the Tolkeen theme. I mean, I don't dislike it but I can think of half a dozen settings I would prefer just off the top of my head. I like the game and anything that mixes it up, keeps it fresh and allows for some fun and unique mechanics is a win for me. But YMMV and that's okay too.

I'm not contesting whether the sea, ports, ships, etc. are relevant to the lore of Middle Earth. Clearly they play an important part of it. Seafaring ties very well into the concepts of travel, new horizons, mysterious distant lands, renewing change and difference in perspectives, etc.

 

But having an adventure on the high seas? That is what doesn't feel quite right. Sure, corsairs and sea-serpents exist. But they really weren't players in the tales as far as I'm aware. A couple adventures here or there related to ship travel wouldn't be clearly appropriate, sure. But having an entire deluxe expansion and 6 APs on the concept seems a bit overdone. Adventurous ocean-going isn't as much a part of Middle Earth as is Mirkwood or Gondor, is it?

 

Although, I wouldn't be surprised if later APs deal with such things, and we won't have a whole cycle taking place on the water.

 

Let me try again: Although someone crying "this is b.s. the game is over" certainly is giving an irrational response, I think responding with defensiveness and unwillingness to even acknowledge the awkwardness of the concept is also silly. Of course the cards and quests of this cycle may prove to be quite excellent, but that is rather beside the point. The point is that it doesn't jive with the theme as many people imagine it. It is reasonable for you to disagree, but I don't think it's completely irrational for someone to not be pleased with the concept of a ship-sailing cycle.

The whole point of the deluxes/cycles is that they can deviate from the trilogy and the tales we know and explore places we didn't get to explore in them.

In the books Angmar existed, but an adventure in Angmar? In the books the characters never did that. Doesn't make sense, game is dying.

Given that a battle with the corsairs and capturing and manning their fleet was a key plot point in Return of the King (albeit one we were only told about by Gimli and Legolas) I'd have to say an adventure on the high seas is consistent with the Lore, even without references to the Appendices.

 

I personally want to see FFG exploit all the aspects of Middle Earth that they can possibly reach under their license, even if it means exploring places like Rhun and Harad not seen within the text itself.  Heck, *especially* places not explored in the text, like Carn Dum.  I'd actually like to see them exploit the appendices by exploring the time period *before* the Hobbit and described in the appendices.  Who wouldn't love an Eorl hero?  Or recreating the dwarf/Goblin war?  Or Saga expansions based on the last alliance of Elves and Men?

 

There's a whole lot of Middle Earth territory and history that remains to be exploited, if the fan base and creators will oblige.

I think there is a difference between Angmar and a swashbuckler scenario. It's like, I don't know, making a Batman film in summer at daytime. It just doesn't fit with the theme that we're used to. I'm skeptical, but I'm gonna give it a chance.

I'm going to ignore who said what and what they "truly" meant and this and that but I just wanted to throw my two cents in.

 

I can see where people are coming from that "swashbuckling" may not exactly fit with the world of Tolkien, but like the Murder at the Prancing Pony I think it's easy to imagine such a thing being present in this world. 

 

Ships are a major part of Tolkien's world, and in the novels it is mentioned and seen that there are even pirates who plague the shores of Gondor. If there are pirates and ships then it's easy to assume that there would be some swashbuckling, people boarding ships on the open seas and crossing swords.

 

It's a diversion from what we've been used to with forests and caves and orcs and trolls. But it's a nice diversion. I think we'll find ourselves enjoying a fresh perspective and it will add a little more value to the more "true to theme" cycles like Voice of Isengard and Angmar Awakens.

 

Needless to say I'm looking forward to this upcoming Cycle :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

> The whole point of the deluxes/cycles is that they can deviate from the trilogy and the tales we know and explore places we didn't get to explore in them.

 

Yes, certainly. But exploring places and events that were not explored in the source material is very different from exploring themes that were not in the source material. Exploring new places is fun. Exploring new themes could be fun too, but I think it's reasonable for people to be wary of messing with the fundamental theme.

 

 

> In the books Angmar existed, but an adventure in Angmar? In the books the characters never did that. Doesn't make sense, game is dying.

 

It doesn't matter what exactly happened in the books. Exploring new locations is great. The theme is the entire issue here.

Again, I'm not saying ship sailing adventure is totally against Tolkien. (In fact, I explicitly stated in my comment that this is not what I was saying.)

 

I'm saying it's a break from the usual and expected, and that it's not surprising for people to find the idea unsatisfying, or to say it's not true to the source material (because, implied events notwithstanding, it isn't in the source material).

 

 

> I think there is a difference between Angmar and a swashbuckler scenario. It's like, I don't know, making a Batman film in summer at daytime. It just doesn't fit with the theme that we're used to. I'm skeptical, but I'm gonna give it a chance.

 

Exactly. The point is the divergence of feel. Of worldly perspective. I'm not even skeptical; I'm all for accepting the new expansion and cycle. I just think it's asinine to immediately throw away any opinion that suggests it unsettles someone.

Agreed, completely. Ship sailing and battles are indeed a part of the world. But it's a diversion from what we've seen, and despite whatever may have been IMPLIED in the source material, it's never been AN ACTIVE PART of the material.

 

That was not an accident.

 

It wasn't an active part of the source material because such adventures evoke quite a different feel and theme.

 

A feel and theme that some people may find disheartening and untrue.

 

Because, no matter how you try to justify it, in a fundamental way it is untrue.

 

But that doesn't mean it's bad.

 

I'm not against the new expansion/cycle. I'm against obtuse forum vigilantes who ignorantly attack anyone who breathes an opinion not 100% supportive of their precious.

ok so heres what I think.  If you disagree, just flush this comment.  even though the ships and such did exist in tolkien, there was never really much of a focus on it. IT IS TOTALLY WITHIN THE TOLKIEN WORLD TO HAVE SHIPS AND SHIP BATTLES.  Im not say thats bad.  But the reason why I LOVE this game is because of its connection with tolkien, and how it shows me his beautiful world.  I love to adventure not because Im an amazing card play (cause Im not) or because I LOVE card games (i enjoy them but am not in crazy about them) but because I see the beauty that the professor created in them.  its the same reason why I enjoy the movies.  even though they got a lot of things wrong, they did capture some of the amazing world of lotr.  And I think that the designers of this game have run out of things to create that is close to tolkien or have decided to go out on a limb and write about something he vaguely talks about.  I have no problem with people who play the game for the sake of its good design liking this. But I personally don't love this idea of ships because it is no longer a game based closely off of tolkiens world, but a game derived from some obscure tolkien quotes.  

Don't be offended.  You may love tolkien more than I do and think that this is a great idea.  if thats true don't call be a troll.  I am telling you what I believe, and you are perfectly reasonable in believing what you believe.  Again, I don't think theirs anything antitolkien in ships and such,  but when the main goal of the game becomes to make a good game rather than to show the beauty of tolkien through a good game, I will quietly disagree.  as was said originally but under a completely different context, "no ships for me please!"

Personally, I think it's a bit too soon to be denouncing the feel or vibe of a cycle when none of it has yet been released so we don't actually know how the quests play...

The Lord of the Rings is largely told from the four hobbits point of view. Anytime they aren't in the picture things happen quickly and in passing. This is why Tolkien didn't go into detail on the sea battles.

Honestly, I know the theme is very important to a lot of people (and I respect that) but if you want to get worried I would be more concerned with the mechanics of the ships & seafaring--let's face it, pirate--setting. A lot of pretty good games have had a hard time translating similar themes when their systems aren't built specifically to deal with them. 

 

Pathfinder Skull & Shackles comes to mind as a prime example since it's somewhat similar to LotRs. The core game was pretty mechanically sound but whenever you had to interact with your "ship" the rules started to clunk hard. 

 

Hopefully FFG allows enough abstraction that we don't get bogged down too much with scenario and ship-specific rules.

This is absolutely true and is largely a question of scale. LOTR LCG might be ok here because the questing stage is fairly abstract in execution. We'll see.

Not sea-going vessels AFAIK, but that's probably a function of need rather than any special aversion to the water.  In both the first and third ages the Orcs were on the same land mass as their enemies, and in the second age Sauron went to Mordor *because* he couldn't compete with the sea strength of the Numenor (at least that's the implication I draw from Appendix B tale of years).  Orcs *did* use boats within the Lord of the Rings.  Faramir's messenger in "The Siege of Gondor" reports "It is now seen that in secret they have long been building floats and barges in great numbers in East Osgiliath.  They swarmed across like beetles."  Orcs also took the island Cair Andros.

I suppose what you means by "AN ACTIVE PART".  The battle with the Corsairs of Umbar are not directly observed by Hobbits, but they are explicitly described and not just implied.  I'll grant that there was no high seas battle in the Return of the King, but Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli arrive at Pellenor in what is essentially pirate ships.

 

It also matters what you consider the "source material".  I certainly include the Appendices in the source material, especially for a game set largely *between* the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings.  Appendix A shows that the sea battles and sea power were of enormous interest to Gondor throughout its history.  And of particular interest to a mysterious captain and favorite of Ecthelion II, Thorongil (a.k.a. Aragorn).

 

"Thorongil often counselled Ecthelion that the strength of the rebels of Umbar was a great peril to Gondor, and a threat to the fiefs of the south that would prove deadly, if Sauron moved to open war.  At last he got leave of the Steward and gathered a small fleet, and he came to Umbar unlooked for by night, and there burned a great part of the ships of the Corsairs.  He himself overthrew the Captain of the Haven in battle upon the quays, and then he withdrew his fleet with small loss."

 

Battling corsairs is certainly a change in setting from what we've seen in past cycles.  But it's actually right in the wheelhouse of the source material.

That's cool to know, thank you.

 

So no sea vessels, but perhaps we could get at least a boat that is manned wih humans but has some orc troops on it. And am i the only one who desperatly wants to engage a ghost ship?

> >

What I mean is that the battles were not explicitly narrated. We, the audience, were not present and in the midst of them.

 

One can claim that this was because the hobbits didn't witness them, but then the hobbits didn't witness the travels of the three hunters either, but we the readers had plenty of explicit narration on that part.

 

Again, I'm not saying ship battles are so alien to Tolkien to be a reason to discard this cycle out of hand, but rather it's reasonable for someone to feel they don't fit with the explicit narrative - because they weren't part of the explicit narrative. All we got were dry, historian-esque factoids about them. The source material doesn't delve into them directly. And for a reason.

That's Tolkien for you. The Appendices are basically a collection of dry, historian-esque factoids about diverse peoples and events, and yet here we are with quests like Ruins of Belegost, Mount Gram, Celebrimbor's Secret, etc etc. The whole point of the game (except for the sagas), is that the designers can take a minuscule account of an event or place not dealt with anywhere else and create a story from it. I see no reason why Belegaer and sea battles are more far fetched than the quests I just named.

The whole Angmar cycle is based also on dry historical facts ... Rhudaur, Carn Dum etc are nearly not mentioned in source material.

I guess people are silent when they get what they like, but when they don't - they start coming up with reasons why the stuff they don't like shouldn't be, like "source material doesn't delve into this directly, and for a reason" (while the only reason it's not delving there is none of the characters being present there physically at the times of the source material events).

I think this really hits the nail on the head.  I came to this game really looking at it to be a chance to explore the story lines from The Hobbit and LOTR in a new way.  However, as time has gone on I find myself more enthralled with the non-Saga material because it offers a chance to see other parts of the world that we do not already know and experience new events.  I have really enjoyed playing through each story and each cycle because it has led me to parts of ME that I am unfamiliar with...kinda like an actual adventure!  I am always amazed and amused by the devs' ability to find interesting places and events for us to explore, not to mention their aptitude for marrying these with interesting mechanics that really reflect the theme of these new areas.

 

I'll also add that the exploration of these new areas has pulled me deeper down the Tolkien rabbit-hole and introduced me to a much wider understanding of the lore.

You're so tunnel-visioned that you can't look past the term of "willpower" and see that it's merely an atribute that represents one's capacity to perform non-combat duties? Do you realize that it would invoke much confusion and a lot of unnecessary complications if they would replace willpower for ship cards with something else? Not to say that would be completely pointless, given the purpose this attribute will be used for.

Ships have a crew...unless you think the heroes are sailing it by themselves. This crew as a collective has a level of morale, courage, skills, and determination. In other words, willpower.

Look at the Spirit Rohan cards from the first cycle. Take something like Astonishing Speed, which gives Rohan peeps +2 willpower. Does this represent the strength of will of the riders? No! It represents their ability to make progress on the quest. Similarly, the wp of the ships represents their ability to make progress on the quest, or in other words, their speed.

Ruins of Belegost, Mount Gram, Celebrimbor's secret, etc. are all in-tune with the style of the active narrative.

 

That certain places, people, and events weren't actively presented isn't the point. The fact that certain styles of adventure were never presented in active narrative is the point.

I'm not saying we only stick to the Hobbit/LotR content. No one complained about Rhudaur, Carn Dum, etc. because their not being in the active narrative wasn't the point. They were still perfectly in line with the themes and style of the active narrative. Ship battles and pirate antics are not. If you want to take things from the Appendices and Histories, etc., all well and good. But if you take something and present it with a style that is found nowhere in Tolkien's works, then don't be surprised if some people find it to be counter to the true spirit.

 

Tolkien could have put space-traveling unicorns that shoot lasers out of their horns in an Appendix, and it's validity in and of itself would not be questioned. But if you were to then make a derivative work that actively presented space-traveling unicorns shooting lasers out of their horns, would you not be surprised if many people said it wasn't in the spirit of Tolkien?

I'm not saying something should be criticized just because it wasn't in the active narrative. Again, the fact that the places, people, and events are different isn't the issue. The issue is the fact that the theme/feel/style is different.

 

I think the most likely reason they were not part of the narrative is because they were dramatically different from the common feel of the narrative that he actually wrote. If Tolkien had wanted that type of adventure to be part of the feel, he could have easily had a character involved in such travails. But such adventures would have given the works a completely different tone than what they wound up with.

 

 

Again, I'm not saying this cycle or its ideas are bad or won't work. I actually suspect it will be quite cleverly implemented and a lot of fun. I'm just trying to objectively point out why some people may be upset with it. But perhaps a forum dedicated to XYZ is the last place to expect objective discussion related to XYZ. :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

The fact that the theme/feel/style is different is not an issue, it's the whole point of different cycles that each take you to different, new places and meet you with new people and foes. The most likely reason they were not part of the narrative is because there was enough stuff going on as it was, and there was no sense in throwing in additional stuff for those particular books.

Let me try to be more clear. Willpower, Attack, Defense and Hit Points are all abstractions. We have a tendency to want to make them correspond to physical, measurable, things because it is easier for our minds to conceive of them that way. This does not stop them from being abstractions. Once you accept that 4 represents Eowyn's ability help accomplish her goals, and 3 represents Legolas' ability to defeat his enemies, it doesn't have to be so different to have these same concepts for a Ship. Willpower for a seafaring vessel could easily represent its maneuverability or speed - very important characteristics for navigating a ship to your destination (ie. achieving your goal). Likewise it should not seem so strange that a ship could have weapons, and that these weapons could be represented by a value so that you can compare it to other vessels to determine its relative prowess in naval warfare. Likewise, a stronger hull can withstand more punishment before it breaches and the ship sinks - this is a natural fit to be represented by hit points.

 

Nitpicking the details is missing the forest for the trees. These are all just abstractions. You might have a greater enjoyment of the game if you just embraced the fact that abstractions are necessary in order to represent something as rich and diverse as Middle-earth in a card game. Then again, you might just really hate ships. Too each their own, I just feel like if the abstraction of willpower/attack/defense/hit points makes no sense, then the game itself doesn't make any sense either. A zero-sum game, so to speak. This very line of argument seems odd and self-defeating to me. Perhaps I am misunderstanding you?

Again I say, they are not released yet. No-one here has played them. On what are you basing your judgement of their feel or style?

Why? Why is it so important to model things in different ways, when it's so much simpler (and thus more player-friendly) to model them the same way since the whole thing is an abstraction anyway?

PocketWraith: "Again I say, they are not released yet. No-one here has played them. On what are you basing your judgement of their feel or style?"

 

I'm not judging the entirety of their feel or style. But we can have an inkling, because style and theme are heavily influenced by the places, people, and events involved. This is a fundamental truth of human communication, regardless of the medium.

 

...

 

I'm sure there are philosophers in the Star Wars universe, and some of their lectures and actions have a significant impact upon that world. But a Star Wars movie consisting of philosophical debates and propaganda twists would give a very different feel than anything that's come before, no matter how else they try to dress it up in traditional Star Wars style.

 

Sure, Tarzan battled wild cats and other predators. But he mostly foraged, staked out territory, and otherwise helped to maintain the community he was a part of. Yet a stage play describing a particularly difficult foraging year, or a wildfire that forced his clan to relocate and deal with finding new resources and resolving interpersonal conflicts, would have a dramatically different feel than anything that came before - no matter how many vines he swung from in the process.

 

Every war has spies, intrigue, and backroom dealings that guide military intelligence, but a Call of Duty or other first person shooter that took an espionage twist would feel dramatically different than anything that came before, even if the spies were more "James Bond" style with machine guns, bombastic armored vehicles, and other FPS tropes.

 

...

 

And so, is it really so hard to see how someone may feel that actively participating in ship battles and fighting pirates gives them a different feel than the usual traveling over land, exploring depths, and battling regimented soldiers or clans or feral beasts? Sure, there are similarities. And certainly, the way things are presented can help keep things significantly in line with the common themes and styles of what has come before. I am not claiming that this cycle will be completely off-the-wall. Indeed, the  mechanics, art, and game flow are all likely to still have a "Tolkien-esque" feel and flavor to them.

 

But you cannot ignore the base fact that the events themselves have a significant impact on tone. The very fact that one is on a ship gives the player a sense of tone and feel immediately, and we clearly know that already without having played the game.

 

I'm not trying to convince anyone this cycle's themes are "false", nor do I even count myself among those who are concerned in any way. But rather I'm just trying to point out why some people may find ship battles jarring. And after banging my head against the wall so long and hard and only getting misunderstood every step of the way, it's clear that people here are more interested in being defensive of a perceived attack on their precious than they are in understanding.

A horse that you can fetch with a card called master of the FORGE, if I may add.

They were still perfectly in line with the themes and style of the active narrative. Ship battles and pirate antics are not. If you want to take things from the Appendices and Histories, etc., all well and good. But if you take something and present it with a style that is found nowhere in Tolkien's works, then don't be surprised if some people find it to be counter to the true spirit.

But if you were to then make a derivative work that actively presented space-traveling unicorns shooting lasers out of their horns, would you not be surprised if many people said it wasn't in the spirit of Tolkien?

 

Here's where our perceptions of the source material differs.  I consider the appendices part of the source material, so the idea that things found there (or for that matter, in the Silmarillion) are *certainly* in the "spirit of Tolkien".  The themes and the style of the "active narrative" are very different between the Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, which in turn is very different from Unfinished Tales, but all are set in a consistent world with a rich history and background.  It is the world of Middle Earth that is the setting for the game, not just the children-friendly style of the Hobbit or the more serious writing in TLOTR.

 

A rich history and background that explicitly includes corsairs and mighty fleets!  Thorongil's (Aragorn's) raid on Umbar wouldn't be out of place in an Errol Flynn movie, and I don't consider it a dry historical factoid that Thorongil personally slew the Master of the Ships himself before sailing away!  I consider it the sort of incident that I *very much* want to recreate in the game.

 

The Corsairs of Umbar also have a significant role in the text of the LOTR, so it would be a crying shame to leave them out of the card game, and good luck bringing the corsairs in without involving ships and pirates, given what they were and how they travelled.

 

Now it's fair to say that the battle of Pelrigir did not include ship to ship battles, and ship battles in the raid on Umbar are only implicit.  Though I am reminded by your mention of the "space travelling unicorns" of the most famous battle-involving-a-ship in the history of Middle Earth.  Earendil in his flying ship Viniglot took down the most powerful of dragons, Ancalagon the Black.  So here Tolkien's works has the most incredible ship battle ever conceived of, flying ship versus dragon, and FFG is getting pushback for actually featuring the ship battles that must have happened historically in the very period the game is set in, by the opponents that must have been in them?  Really?

 

Earendil's flying ship isn't just space-travelling unicorns tucked into an obscure corner of the appendices, either.  The main text has no less than a nine verse poem written by Bilbo (with a minor assist from the Dunadan) on Earendil and his ship, and the light from it, captured in the Phial of Galadriel, was essential for Frodo and Sam's passage into Mordor.  In Tolkien mythology and history are intimately related.

These are all valid points for why the upcoming cycle gives some people no pause. I'm glad you're looking forward to it, and hope you enjoy it. I am looking forward to it myself, and am sure I will enjoy it myself.

 

 

But the poem being in the main text or any of your other examples don't counteract the point I've been trying to make. In fact, they actually reinforce my point: Such things never actively happened in the "here and now" of the narrative. If they had, that would have provided a different feel than anything that had been provided before.

 

 

There is a reason why Earendil's flying ship was related in a fantastic, dreamy poem, and why the raid on Umbar was described as a legendary tale of inspiring heroism instead of being explicitly shown. This isn't to say that it would have been bad to show such things or experience them, only that doing so would have resulted in a dramatically different tone and feel - again, not bad, just different.

 

 

Again, I'm not saying anyone who doesn't question the upcoming themes is "wrong". I'm merely trying to point out that it's reasonable for someone to not find it to be appropriate from their perspective. Why must everyone accept your interpretation as the only correct one? It's perfectly understandable why someone may find this upcoming cycle to be off style.

Agree to disagree. I fully agree with danpoage.

The op was also that ships etc. would be to far-fetched, and that is, as danpoage pointed out, not true.

I guess it's all a matter of taste. Each one of us has a different Middle Earth existing in their minds, which is the cool thing about fiction, you know?

 

In my Middle Earth there are no ships and oceans and pirates. It's all Orcs and monsters and Gollum.

I guess what bothers me is the invocation of "style", since Tolkien's style is not consistent between the two major works inspiring the game and does not preclude any particular content.  I'm also not sympathetic to the idea that ships/pirates are something unseen in the main narrative when Aragorn & Co. show up to the battle of Pellenor Fields in captured pirate ships.  But after giving it some thought, I think what's driving the sense of incongruity is actually genre.

 

Corsairs and their ships are at home in Tolkien's world, as seen not just in the appendices but also the main text of LOTR.  Cycles of the game involving regions and peoples that lie mostly outside the main narrative is the bread and butter of the non-saga packs.  Looked at from my narrow Tolkien-focused perspective all seems as it should be -- but if I take a step back and look at it in the tradition of high fantasy *inspired* by Tolkien, then suddenly the idea of pirates and ship battles seems jarring, especially since a separate genre also exists for pirates.  Seen as a *Tolkien* game, the Corsairs of Umbar are a natural and even obvious subject.  Seen as a generic fantasy game, ship battles and pirates are out of place from the familiar world of dwarves and elves, goblins and dragons.  I love both genres, but *outside* Tolkien overlap is slim.  The Princess Bride, maybe.

 

My hope, and I have high confidence that it will be realized, is that this cycle will be consistent with the lore, and not just put a high fantasy skin on "Treasure Island".  Ship battles are fine, but they best not be flying the Jolly Roger.  It's a good sign that the "Light Cruiser" depicted as a Corsair enemy ship has black sails and oars, as described in the *main text* of the Lord of the Rings.

@JohnGarrison: The reason I kept harping on the point that no-one has played the quests so we don't know the feel/tone is because I interpreted your argument as suggesting that the portrayal did not mesh with Tolkien, which we cannot know in advance. Instead it seems you're suggesting that a seafaring adventure inherently cannot mesh with the usual feeling of Tolkien, which I disagree with for entirely different reasons.

Firstly, I can't agree with your repeated assertion that "there was a reason why events such as these didn't feature in the main narrative, because they would result in a dramatically different tone," etc. I would contend that the only reason such events do not occur iin the main narrative is that Tolkien plotted out how the story was to happen and it happened that the way his ideas ran had it all taking place on land, with the exception of Aragorn leading the army of the Dead to fight the Corsairs - and the reason that takes place 'off-screen' I think is simply to build suspense by having us hear nothing of what's happening to that group between them entering the Paths of the Dead and them reappearing at Pelennor Fields.

Secondly and more importantly, the Tolkien feel is primarily down to the richness of the fantastical world we are exploring in all its wonders. In fact the tidbits of information about making sailing tests, and being on-course or off-course to me fits quite similarly to early parts of Fellowship, with the hobbits and Aragorn getting lost and turned around in the wilderness. This is still the Tolkien world, with Tolkien characters, so I don't see how the fact those characters are sailing a ship across the ocean rather than walking through a forest inherently makes it less Tolkienian - even less so when the whole thing is abstracted into game mechanics anyway.

That's not to say that a sea adventure couldn't mean a move away from the proper Tolkien feel - I could certainly imagine a situation where the sea battles start to feel more Pirates of the Carribbean (for example) than Lord of the Rings, but the previews and FFG's previous track record with representing Arda in this game do not give me reason to expect that to happen.

(Tl;dr - Just because sea battles and the like weren't ever presented in the same Tolkienian style as the rest of the LotR narrative is no reason to think they couldn't be, if done right)

It is a matter of taste.  The cool thing about fiction, to me, is the worlds that exist outside my mind, and the joy of discovering them.  Tolkien is my favorite precisely because it seems to reveal a fully existing world with real history, mythology, and language that I had never known.  Tolkien is merely the historian giving us some small state of this world, which exists in objective form outside my imagination and has so many wonders still unlearnt and undreamed of in my imagination.

 

Even in less developed fictional worlds, I'm not sure exactly how I can excise "canonical" material I don't like.  I'd prefer there be no Jar-Jar Binks, but I don't really believe I have the power to reject Lucas' reality and substitute my own.

 

In your middle earth, how did Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas get to Minas Tirith?
