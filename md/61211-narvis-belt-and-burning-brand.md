Can I attach Burning Brand to a hero that wears Narvi's Belt and uses the belt's ability to get the lore resource icon during the planning phase?

 Yes !

I don't know that I agree with that. Narvi's Belt isn't an 'all the time' attachment, like Song of Wisdom. It's only for one phase:

ACTION: Exhaust Narvi's Belt to give attached hero a resource icon of your choice until the end of the phase.

So, yes you can use it to pay for something of a different sphere, but right after the planning phase is over, the hero reverts back to whatever type of hero he normally is (i.e. not Lore, unless we're talking about a Lore hero in which case this argument is irrelevent anyway) and since A Burning Brand must be attached to a Lore hero, I don't see this as working correctly, UNLESS the hero has to exhaust the Belt in order to use the effect of the Brand (i.e. exhaust it at the beginning of the combat phase), which would mean the hero couldn't use the Brand in any round that the Belt was used (since it would be exhausted).

 I would have thought the check for the Lore icon match occurs only once when you are playing A Burning Brand from your hand.

i answer to the above, ive seen it stated (faq?) that the hero only needs to have the lore icon on the turn of playing the card. this is similar to if the hero loses the song of wisdom do they keep the brand? yes, so i think the same applies

It was somewhere on the forum official answer from Nate you need check icon only when you play attachment. After attachment stay anyway on character even if he lose a sphere icon.

Ok, I guess I was wrong. Just seems kinda funky to me. The belt is already very powerful and now even moreso.

## 8 [richsabre on March 1, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61211-narvis-belt-and-burning-brand/?do=findComment&comment=600831)

yeah, but i think its one of those attatchments thats meant to be that powerful

## 9 [booored on March 1, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61211-narvis-belt-and-burning-brand/?do=findComment&comment=600879)

it is unique for a reason.. but there is at leat 3 decks that I know of that wee this card is a key card, and they are all extremely powerful decks. There is no doubt that this is one of the most powerful cards in khaz.

Thanks folks for answering and clearing that issue. I thought it should be possible myself, but like Faradey I was hesitant because the hero gets the lore icon only during the planning phase.

Very powerful card indeed especially if you combine it with SoG or heroes like Theodred and Bifur. It also enables a player to play card from all spheres without having to use the songs.

## 12 [radiskull on March 1, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61211-narvis-belt-and-burning-brand/?do=findComment&comment=600972)

 Steward of Gondor, unique, exhaust the attachment to give the hero 2 resources.

Let's see if you can answer out the one million dollar question:

 

A. Song of Glóin

B. Son of Gimil

C. Steward of Gondor

D. Shade of Grey

Edit: radiskull is apparently your phone-a-friend joker!

 You fixed it!  I find it somewhat ironic that you of all people would be the one. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Thread necromancy...

 

Taking a closer look at Narvi's Belt, I have to wonder whether you can ever use it to contribute to the purchase of allies/attachments during the Planning phase.

 

http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/khazad-dum/narvis-belt-kd [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/khazad-dum/narvis-belt-kd]

 

Exhausting Narvi's Belt is an action the effects of which (granting a resource icon to the wearer of the belt) lasts only to the end of the phase. According to the turn sequence chart at the end of the rule book, putting cards into play during the Planning Phase occurs before the action window… meaning that by the time you exhaust Narvi's Belt, it should be too late to use its powers to help put allies/attachments of a sphere different than that of the Belt's wearer into play.

 

Likewise, A Burning Brand could only be played on a hero wearing Narvi's Belt in a multi-player game, and then only if the turn of player playing A Burning Brand was later in the turn sequence than that of the player with the hero wearing Narvi's Belt. It wouldn't work in a straight solo game.

 

So, if I interpret its text correctly, it seems that Narvi's Belt is helpful mainly for playing events or triggering certain abilities (e.g., Dain wearing Narvi's Belt could exhaust the belt to grant him a Lore icon for the phase, thereby enabling him to use Erebor Record Keeper to ready a dwarf character, adding to a Longbeard Map-Maker's willpower, etc.).

 

Is this how everyone else reads it? I ask because for the longest time, I played it as though it could be used to put allies and attachments during Planning, but now think that was incorrect.

Look at the turn sequence chart more carefully - the putting cards into play step is green, meaning that player actions can be taken freely during it.

That would also mean O Lorien! couldn't help you, or Heir of Valandil, Master of Lore... I'm sure the list goes on.  Green color represents 'any player may take actions generally, or between specific steps in the game rules,' and since we don't have specific steps and action windows outlines in the manual's explanation of the Planning phase, we can just take actions any time.  So that 'player actions' bar underneath the one that says 'first player plays allies...' is just redundant.

 

The manual's explanation of the combat phase, by contrast, gives specific instruction about where action windows occur.

Ah yes, my bad, don't know how I missed that (face palm)… so I guess i had been playing it right all along previously. Seems my powers of observation waned during my brief hiatus from the game.  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

 

Anyhow, thanks to you both, GrandSpleen and PocketWraith, for the reminder and explanation.
