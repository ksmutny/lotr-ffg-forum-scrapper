# [Bets: Will Sahir remain loyal, or will he turn on us?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/204554-bets-will-sahir-remain-loyal-or-will-he-turn-on-us/)

## 1 [John Constantine on March 4, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/204554-bets-will-sahir-remain-loyal-or-will-he-turn-on-us/?do=findComment&comment=2084955)

With the information we currently possess, the infamous Captain Sahir at some point (during the fight with a Craken) will become our ally and will even aid us right off the bat at the beginning of the next quest. 

 

I propose a bet: let us try to predict what would happen to him at the course of the cycle? 

The possible outcomes I see (from best to worst):

1) Sahir remains loyal til' the end and we get the hero(yay!)/ally(meh) version of him at some point of the cycle;

2) Sahir remains loyal, but only as an objective ally;

3) Sahir betrays us at some point further in the cycle;

4) Sahir double-crosses us at this very quest where we have him as an ally from the beginning.

 

The winners'll get: nothing! Moral satisfaction, maybe :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

 

It would be funny if an answer to this question will be revealed in some upcoming preview article and not when the quests are released :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

Or, what would be even more fan, is if there would be some conditions with "alternate endings", one with Sahir at your side, another with him against you. But that will never happen :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Going to go with 3. It's a tragic waste of an enemy to not have him betray the Dreamchaser crew.

I'm a realist myself, though I would want number 1 to be the case, I know it's extremely unlikely, but I still think that betraying us this soon is too much, so I would go with 4 :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

I think he'll turn at the very last moment when we finally open the chest. Would like to see hero or ally version, but I think it's very unlikely.

I think Sahir will return to enemy status, and the girl will join us as a player card.

Ins't she his right hand or something? Would be strange for him to become an enemy once again, while she'll join us for some reason :o [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_ohmy.png]

hmmmmm grandspleen your theory is really interesting and I think that is a possibility too based on some of the story text in the grey havens box... (her interaction with Sahir...)

Otherwise I would guess:

3) I too like Gizlivadi think he will betray us at the last and most opportune moment, right when we get to whatever that key unlocks... or he might betray us in the following quest after the fight with the Kraken-esque sea monster.

I think there is a possibility (less likely though) that he will turn on us at the end of the sea monster quest after its defeated.......

lets hope not though..

Yeah, she is second guessing Sahir in the story text... looks like foreshadowing.

This would be the coolest outcome, but then imagine playing the first 2 Grey Havens quests with her. It'd still feel very odd.

I think this possibility is completely ruled out, because we already have him as our ally right in the next quest after the sea monster battle.

Now that I've seen the actual narrative, I think the turning point will be either when they find the chest or as soon as they open it. Maybe on the way back, though.

The fact that Sahir is depicted on the first quest stage of the Island of the Decieved and not depicted on the first quest stage of the Drowned Ruins might also serve as a potential clue...  :ph34r: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_ph34r.png]

Sahir is a corsair ... as an honest pirate then he must betray us at some point. 

 

I will bet on 3 , but I woulr really like the posibility that he helps us all the way to the end, and at the last moment of the last AP, when we discover the chest and win the quest, he steals it and dissappear, thus we never learn the secret  :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

I suspect we might open the chest at the very 4 AP, and then things will happen as a result of chest being opened: like some eldritch power being unleashed, or pirates from all world start chasing us to claim the prize. Or something.

wait so the chest either summons Cthulu or turns middle earth into a one piece situation? :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

im in!

jokes aside that does seem like the most likely outcome at this point...

opening the chest in the fourth AP and Sahir betraying us some point from quest 4 onwards.

As far as the chest goes I'm not really sure where they could possibly go and what we could potentially be hunting for that could help the free peoples during the war of the ring (why else would we be doing this?)... very excited to see what it is though!

Even odder if you play her in the third quest and have her fight herself!

 

Although I guess strictly speaking the Setup rules would immediately set both copies of her aside, and at some point you'd end up with your own hero in the staging area!

Nah. If we assume that she is going to be released as a hero, then the insert will simply say something like this: No player can use Nyashish (or whatever) hero card while playing Grey Havens or Dreamchaser quests until this one.

 

There can be pretty funny situations in this game either way. Like, for example, imagine Grima escorting Frodo all the way from Shire, then he is like:"Hold on, fellas, I got some pressing matters to attend to at Orthanc!", departs, attempts to hinder himself some Aragorn, fails, returns to helping Frodo reach Mount Doom.

Then at the very end Grima will once again become a villain in scouring of the shire and one of your own heroes will in a way be the last boss enemy! Alongside Sharkey of course but still! Hero to villain to reformed hero to final villain! what a rollercoaster!

If only Saruman hero existed, the plot twists could be even more real... x_x
