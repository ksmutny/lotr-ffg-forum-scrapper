The online quest companion site seems to be down.
Does anybody know if this website has been permanently closed or if it's just temporary?

Cheers

@banania [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/252848-banania/] Any chance you'd be able to update the quest companion soon? Your site is really useful, Thanks. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Hello,

Unfortunately, the .com domain has expired a few days ago, and I won't be renewing it due to lack of money, time and motivation to maintain it. I know I somewhat "break" a part of my engagement to this community but as a standard of living, I refuse to be dragged down by something I don't want to do anymore; especially if I lose time and money in it, which I lost plenty.

The Quest Companion will eventually come back, don't worry. I've prospected for someone to take over for a few months, unfortunately, some of those guys though interested, lack the time themselves to incorporate the quest companion content into their own support. However, I've no worries someone will eventually show up.

If you're yourselves interested, please send me a message.

The website is HTML+CSS+jquery with a mysql database and php.

@banania [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/252848-banania/] I completely understand. Thank you for building and maintaining this fabulous resource for a long time! And already kudos to the whoever picks up the maintenance. Personally I don't have the skills or the time to take care of it.

I understand. Thanks for what you've already accomplished with the quest companion!

@banania

What about porting the info to a free wiki service like wikia or wikidot? This takes care of both the problems of cost (hosting is free) and time commitment (it's a wiki, so it can be updated by the community).

## 13 [banania on February 15, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/248687-quest-companion-down/?do=findComment&comment=3215589)

I understand you well but that would still need some dedicated re-formatting all that SQL content to wiki format. A very tedious work, especially considering the time I spend putting that in a database in the first place.

I kinda like the idea of a wiki. What about the Wikipedia? Would that be an option?

Hi

Just curious how difficult this would be to implement?  I have plenty of hosted space and would be happy to host this on site on my servers indefinitely for free.  If you could help me set it up (aka transfer it) I have a complete setup already so a HTML+CSS+Jquery site with mysql database and php are no problem.  I'm not sure I would want to commit to maintaining (aka updating the site) but it would at least have a permanent home. 

Let me know if your interested.
