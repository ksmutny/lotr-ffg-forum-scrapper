 Howdy Forum,

 

I made a new video. You can watch me play against Shadow and Flame without looking at the Encounter deck prior to playing, aka my very first game. Not sure if fun though ^^

Cheers

Cool video and cool deck. There is mistakes but not really important.

there is one mistakes trick with second quest card. When you revealed this card you should to add 4 quest points to this cards cose you have hero commit to the quest previously  on the first stage.Even when you just came to second quest card you put progress tokens in the end of the quest phase. I hope you understand what i mean.

Actually this quest is quite stupid  and monotony special when you have Hama and feint + Beravur or Bibo to cycle feint. And you dont care about Balrog anymore! Quite annoying no?

That's actually quite cool, hadn't thought about this. Thx for pointing that out.

I agree, Hama + Feint seems to trivialize the quest. And so does Frodo I guess.

Did you find additional mistakes apart from the ones I mentioned already? Let me know, I want to improve.
