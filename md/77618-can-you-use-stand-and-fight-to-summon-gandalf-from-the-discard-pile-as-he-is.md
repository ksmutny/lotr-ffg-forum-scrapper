Can you use 'Stand And Fight' to summon Gandalf? from the discard pile as he is a 'Neutral' card?

Please can some one reply and say if I can or not as I would fail this game I'm now playing! :/

No. It is in the faq that because he is neutral he is not of any sphere & an ineligible target. Sounds fishy reasoning for te effect they want but stil you can't do itÂ
