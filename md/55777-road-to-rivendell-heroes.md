With the annoucement of the 2nd adventure pack in the Dwarrowdelf cycle, FFG has spoiled the Rivendell Blade. Could we assume that the 2 first heroes of the Dwarrowdelf cycle would be Elladan and Elrohir? Or could it be someone else? What are your thoughts about the new heroes in the coming cycle?

 There has also been talk of Glorfindel getting a Spirit or Tactics version in this cycle.  The blade would make me lean towards tactics.

There was talk of another version of Glorfindel at some point in the nebulous future.  At the point Nate made those concepts, this set would have already been designed.  I would be shocked to see another version of Glorfindel in this cycle, and I don't think we have any suggestion that it will happen.

 I think it was in the Dwarrowdelf intro article it talked about "some new (familiar) faces" which presumably is a return of a character we've already seen. Given the elf theme that seems to be going on, i think either a new Glorfindel or a hero version of Haldir/Gildor etc.

where/when was this comment about a new Gildor somewhere in the nebulous future that was probably too recent to be this made?

You can find a summary of the interview here [http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/707056/nate-french-on-theonering-net].

Rereading the text, I take back what I said.  Nate was vaguer than I remember.  So, it could be a tactics or Glorfindel.

To get back to the original post.

I have found confirmation that the elf featured on the box is indeed Elladan or Elrohir. On Magali Villeneuve's site, she put the full picture up and it has the title, El-MagaliVilleneuve.jpg. So we know it's one of them, she was clever enough not to give away exactly who though! My guess is that it's Elladan. I say that because Elrohir means Elf-rider and I'm hoping FFG will really show their awesomeness and put Elrohir on a horse for his picture. That being said, Elladan does have two L's and she only put one in the title so it may be Elrohir after all.

Couldn't it be Elrond himself ?

Personally, I won't expect Elrond as a character card until the 3rd Adventure Pack at least.
