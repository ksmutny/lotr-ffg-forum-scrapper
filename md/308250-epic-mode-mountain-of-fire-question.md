If I remember correctly the players divide those cards between the encounter decks as they like. I'm pretty sure this is addressed in the box somewhere (probably in the rules insert or on the campaign card).

Yes, according to the Mountain of Fire insert: "If a boon or burden is included as part of the Setup for both scenarios, the player who controls the Ring-bearer decides which scenario receives that boon or burden."
