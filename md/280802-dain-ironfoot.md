Hi!

I have a question because i want to be sure i am correct...Dian's abillity (While Dain Ironfoot is ready, Dwarf [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Search?Trait=Dwarf.]characters get +1 attack-small.png [http://hallofbeorn.com/Images/attack-small.png] and +1 willpower-small.png [http://hallofbeorn.com/Images/willpower-small.png].) it applies for all dwarfs characters belonging to all players...not only to characters belonging to Dain's owner player, right?
