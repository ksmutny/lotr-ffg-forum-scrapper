Hi guys,

If I defeat this stage and Gollum has not resource token on him Do I still need to make an Escape test?

Regards,

Technically you would still be required to exhaust characters for it, but no encounter cards would be flipped over. The Escape value is basically zero in this case, so as long as you commit more than that, you'll automatically win.

Thanks Wandalf.

During the quest phase, commiting characters toÂ the escape tests is optional, right?

Correct! You'll fail the test in that case, though.
