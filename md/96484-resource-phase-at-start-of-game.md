I'm not finding a clear answer in the rulebook so thought I would ask here.  After drawing your initial setup hand of 6 cards, do you then draw one additional card at the start of the resource phase, effectively starting the game with 7 cards?

 

Thanks in advance.

You are correct.  

 

The drawing of six cards is part of setup (step 5).  If you want, you can take a single mulligan (shuffle and draw another six). 

 

When the game begins the first round you then have the first resource phase and get to draw another card.
