What do you think are the strongest decks we have? Is Outlands still OP? Dwarf-swarm still the best? Has Aggro Boromir been dethroned by aggro Caldara? What is your favorite deck to put together in order to crush the encounter deck?

I'm playing Ents right now... and it's bunkers strong!

Outlands are also pretty strong, and I like them with solo nightmare quests, because before they get strong, they are quite fragile, and they never garanty a win.

Caldara... is a metter of personal taste, but it can be strong, depending on the quest.

i've never really felt that Outlands was that overpowered, honestly. it's just easier to pilot and construct (which was the intent, really), but it has a bit of a slow start, and it was quite vulnerable to luck of the draw and losing one ally and collectively losing a lot of power (while the verse was true as well). i did see a deck recently though with Erestor as one of the heroes, and it supercharged it imo. i tried it a few times and really enjoyed it. it was much more aggro than normal and really fun to play.

i tried the original Caldara decks a while ago, but it wasn't that consistent. now it's a bit more consistent and really fun.

although i would say that aggro Boromir isn't necessarily dethroned yet. with all of the Valour cards that came out in Angmar Awakened, Boromir's increase in threat is actually preferred (much more preferred than Doomed in multiplayer settings) and not necessarily a penalty anymore. especially with Favor of the Valar to give you a lot of extra time in the game in Valour range, i think Boromir's as strong as ever

i also think that Leadership resource acceleration has grown a lot, especially with Leadership Denethor and Rod of the Steward, able to use those extra resource to draw cards

my partner has used a Silvan deck for quite a while, and it's only gotten better in this cycle even after the Horn of Gondor nerf (which she didn't use anyway)

my favourite of late has been a Leadership/Spirit Rohan deck. i do want to try to go back to trisphere Leadership/Tactics/Spirit, but i'm still waiting for Flame of the West in my country ;~;

that said, it also suffered from the loss of Horn of Gondor's synergy (why couldn't it have been worded to say discarded from play? it now doesn't even work when an encounter effect says to discard).

but i'm digressing. i'm loving the Rohan deck now, especially with the recent ally additions of Gamling, Eothain, and Ceorl, and i can't wait to add Windfola into it.

I think the strongest deck archetype will vary by quest.  There's a lot of strong decks out there, but they aren't all equally strong against every aspect of the game or equally resilient to nasty treacheries or shadows.  I have a vague plan to construct "stereotypical" decks for each archetype for the purpose of running them against each new quest a few times, to see which comes out on top, but I'm still running through my Dori fellowships and haven't even got to deck construction yet.

 

At some point, ringsdb may add a log feature and we can start attaching W/L to specific quests with specific decks, and analyzing that data will be very interesting, I think.

I find our Tactics/leadership Gondor deck, partnered with lore spirit Gondor, far more powerful than dwarves, out-lands etc

 

Tactics/leadership - lead boromir & denethor, tac Aragorn.  For Gondors, stewart of gondor (for aragorn), sword that was broken, visionary leadership, Faramir Ally, legacy of numenor, gondorian shields etc.  Lots of allies that don't just chump block.  Wealth of gondor , A very good tale, Herald of Anórien

Spirit Gondor - Elanor, Damrod, Beravour  Traps, cancellation, threat reduction, unexpected courage, lots of card draw to keep the other deck going (deep knowledge). Gléowine, Warden of healing.

 

Can easily get +3 willpower for each Gondor ally, so it doesn't matter so much if half of them are tactics and start with zero. Tactigorn gives -1 defense to enemies, +1 attack from Boromir, For gondor for when you realy need to go to town on the attack/def ot have battle/siege quests.

 

Best start we had the Tac/Lead deck played 11 cards on the first turn :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Should be ask in what format? Nightmare or standard ?

On NM mode, Caldara is one of the strongest.

Wouldn't any deck good in Nightmare be automatically very good for standard difficulty?

In order to crush the encounter deck, nothing is more satisfactory than defending with the Gondor and rush enemies with a Rohan charge.
