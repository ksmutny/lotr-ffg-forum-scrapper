# [What If: Each hero had henchmen?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/131797-what-if-each-hero-had-henchmen/)

Continuing the topic of signature squads, I spent some time thinking about set of allies dedicated to supporting core set heroes. Here is what I came up with:

Great ideas you got there and i really would want all of those cards, especially those dwarwes and spirit cards. Gloins devotee is thematically little bit wierd because i don't think that allies would want to harm heroes but it's effect combined with Gloin or Gimli is pretty good. And by the way Aragorn's follower looks pretty much one of the Nazguls i think.

Gloin's Devotee is purposely underpriced to make up for wounding the hero upon entering the game. And if you're playing with Gimli or Gloin, this drawback is turned into bonus.

 

Aragorns follower has human hands. The way he is depicted describes the secrecy of people who follow Aragorn and know he is a true king and stuff.

Not uniques?

Why would they be? They're regular no-names, such as Horse-breeder and stuff.

I suppose. Here's one for Boromir that is unique:

Eleanor's councelor : has a typo on "enocunter" cards. Is a bit high on cost and willpower, it would hurt a lot discarding it :'( 

Glorfindel Attendants : a bit weak imo. (wait, per round ? it's ok then...)

Denethor's Eavesdropper : bit weird on the ruling... like with risk some light, would you look and reorder the four to six cards ? OP ! bit high in cost otherwise.

Gimli Defender's : not sure... bit lacking in defense, but his capacity could mean he cost 0 with some hp boost... 

## 9 [MyNeighbourTrololo on January 13, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/131797-what-if-each-hero-had-henchmen/?do=findComment&comment=1404510)

Suffering Doomed 50 or Surge on a replaced card would hurt more, I guess. His text is purely optional, regardless.

 

With 3 of these guys out, you turn 1 point heal for 1 resource from Glor's ability into 4 points, spread as you wish. With Elrond, it's 8. Still inferior to Warden of Healing, yes, but they were invented to support Glorfindel, not to rival the Warden. And their ability is not tied to their action, so they can still quest and trigger the heal if they must.

 

Eavesdropper effectively increases the amount of cards you look at by 1 when you trigger him. The cost is returning him to your hand, so not repetitible on a regular basis.

 

2def/3hp(4hp with hardy leadershit) is a decent defender, given the fact his cost can be reduced to 0, yeah.

The problem is that they combo too much with some cards, while not being good outside of it. It's not easy to balance them.

 

> Eavesdropper effectively increases the amount of cards you look at by 1 when you trigger him. The cost is returning him to your hand, so not repetitible on a regular basis.

 

What about the "top", like with needful to know ? do you look at the top 2 and reduced your threat by one of them at your choice ? Existing rulling would say so.

## 11 [MyNeighbourTrololo on January 13, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/131797-what-if-each-hero-had-henchmen/?do=findComment&comment=1404560)

Well, henchmen's main purpose is to combo with it's named hero.

 

About needful to know - I would say that you operate for the purpose of card effect only with the first revealed card, the excess one you just look at.

Interesting ideas as always, but I'm not sure I like these from a flavor perspective. Eowyn having a personal protector during her battle against the Witch-King? Hmm, sounds a little weird to me. Also the Grim Reaper is Aragorn's Follower? Lol (yeah, I've seen the full art before). Anyway, I like allies that work directly with the heroes, and some of these could bring forgotten heroes back to life. All in all, the abilities are great, but I'd like them more if they were generic.

You know, Eowyn spends most of her time outside the battle with the witch-king :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

(If you're referncing the art, it's Eowyn herself on the art, I was just sick and tired of searching for a proper rohan guy looking protective)

Eavesdropper and Counseller are a bit weak imo. Counseller is great to have for his stats, but the ability is a bit weak imo, it´s to cost heaving for cancelling a surge or doomed. Eavesdropper, the same actually.

 

Really like Glorfindel's helper guy! And the dwarves are cool and fun!

Imagine Elrond + Glorfindel's attendant. The once per round limit is probably a good thing.

 

Also, is Elanor's Counsellor's artwork from GoT? It's cool.

## 17 [MyNeighbourTrololo on January 13, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/131797-what-if-each-hero-had-henchmen/?do=findComment&comment=1404951)

Well, the Counselor could exist without his ability and still be a good pick (with Visionary Leadershit in play he's 3 wp), and his ability is not forced, so you can use it only when you feel like you need it. Giving him more stats would make him overpowered, raising his costs will make his ability even more questionable.

 

Eavesdropper provides an opportunity. You can take it, you can refuse it. If you're playing solo and use Denethor to scout, triggering Eavesdropper may provide you insight of whats coming even if you put the original card revealed by Denethor at the bottom of the deck. And stuff. Also, he's a decent Gondor ally with a good stat-box-to-cost ratio.

 

Glorfindel's Attendant still needs a heal to occur to trigger his ability.

 

It's probably from GoT, I took it from deviant art by it's appearance, without reading the description (or name :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]).

Great job on these Trololo.  These are actually pretty good.  Some of your other stuff is a bit "meh", but in my opinion this is your best work so far.  There are few fan made cards that I would play with but I like these enough that I probably would. Very nice!

Maybe it's because I didn't tried to invent anything this time, but to explore what we already have more deeply.

If I could make just one big remark on all your work...: give credit to the artist, at least take some minute to try to find his name.

 

This is definitly not to leech what you find.  :rolleyes: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_rolleyes.gif]

Most of the arts comes from different artists, and by the time I strap it onto the card - the site I found it at is alredy closed.

I can note a CG-Warrior, she draws beatiful LotR art and I took a lot from her.

That's just great work! I especially like the idea of henchmen for weaker heroes (say eleanor ^^), glorfindel hardly needs henchmen IMHO.

That's why Glorfindels support allies are regular guys who observe a healing process and improve it.

Jormungandr, it's for the Lore version of Glorfindel. That one hasn't aged well.

> That's why Glorfindels support allies are regular guys who observe a healing process and improve it.

 

But as strong guys tend to stick together, Healer of Gondor would be able to heal two characters for three in my Elrond/Gandalf/Splorfindel deck.

Ok, after quite some thought, here is my take on allies to support heroes from the first cycle... yes, I know, too many defenders:
