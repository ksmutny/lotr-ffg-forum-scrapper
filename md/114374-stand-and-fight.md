So i hope that i haven´t played wrong, but here is my question; can i use this card to put Gleowine from my discard pile to play, and then pay it for 1 lore resource and 1 spirit resource or can i play with only same sphere to pay 2 resources from spirit heroe´s pool to play this card?

Nope, x has to be wholly payed with spirit recources.

No...you need spirit hero to play this card, but you can buy any ally that belongs to any sphere of influence, example Gleowine.

So i am asking answer for that can i buy an ally with two different spheres with this card?

Nope, the X cost on "Stand And Fight" must be payed with spirit resources, whatever is the retrieved ally sphere....

Breaking down the play might help, as well:

 

When you play Stand and Fight, you choose a value of X. In your example, you want X=2. You have to spend 2 resources from Spirit heroes, now. Then you choose an ally with a printed cost of 2, which could be Gleowine. Now, Stand and Fight puts Gleowine into play. You do not have to spend any more resources to do this.

I never tried, but in such a case, you both might want to look into OCTGN.

Naw.... playing online cardgames really sticks my craw. Plus, I'm quite happy to play solo or with the gf.

2 things! 

 

1 You still can play together by otcgn program on window

 

2 Stand and fight cannot return Gandalf ally from discard pile since Gandalf is not belong to any sphere of influence.
