Quick question, in a multiplayer game, if you play a guarded player card and it's attached to an enemy, and eventually that enemy is defeated, does it matter who defeated the enemy? Does the player that played the card get to choose who gets the item? Or is it a group decision?

The language from the Wilds rules is as follows:

> Once free of encounters, its owner gains control of it and attaches it to an eligible card.
