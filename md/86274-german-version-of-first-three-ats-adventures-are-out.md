Why do these names always sound cooler in German?

They don't! Believe me, these are some really flat and bad direct translations^^

I dont know what you are talking about. I like all of the german AP-names.

Yes, let's not pretend that "The Druadan Forest" is a zazzy-gripping name.  I'm not disparaging the name, just stating that it's silly to expect the German to be super exciting if the source material is straightforward.

So you now have translated AtS APs? Well, it's good that you have competent company translating the game, unlike those crybabies from Blackfire who translate the game to Czech language. The Hunt for Gollum is only about to be released and they managed a few errors in the game text as well. For example Lorefindel's text states that he can heal only heroes. But what would one expect from a company who releases sh*tty Arkham Horror translation with switched sanity/stamina or different numbers and their reply to complaining people was "it doesn't affect the gameplay at all".

> They don't!

This.

Well, it took a long time, but the quality of the translation is ok this time. The only thing which I stumbled about are "quest points" (=Abenteuerpunkte). Never heard that before, but apparently they mean the threat of the locations? I mean the translation is correct, but did they use that expression on English cards?

 

Btw, we are still waiting for OtD in Germany. If the mail I got from amazon is correct, it should be out at the end of July.

the threat on the locations is threat and the amount it needs to be cleared are 'progress points' i think? thats what i have referred to them as

According to the rulebook, the amount needed for location clearing is called 'quest points', but the tokens are 'progress tokens'.

So no wonder I loose every single game (except Outlands). I'm not sure what the sense of this ability is? It does... nothing? True, it affects Northern Tracker and Asfaloth, but otherwise: who cares?

Affecting Northern Tracker and Asfaloth is hardly "nothing". This quest already puts a fair amount of pressure on you from locations, and those two player cards are usually the go-to answer for handling locations. The effect on Roots of Mindolluin ("Each location in the staging area gets +2 quest points") significantly counteracts those cards.

 

It shows the designers have obviously learnt a thing or two since the likes of Hills of Emyn Muil...

I hear you, scwont. But why not increasing the printed quest points instead?

 

Anyway I'm glad that this quest is now defeatable for decks other than Outlands.
