Dear All,

I wanted to know how players are storing the encounter cards.

Up till the current cycle for deluxe sets I put each set in a ziplock bag and hold in the deluxe box.

For the adventure packs I was holding the encounter cards in the AP but with the packaging change I can't continue this practise

I have all player cards sleeved in good quality sleeves, then kept in colour coded "ultimate guard 100+ deck boxes"

I then have all encounter cards sleeved with penny sleeves.

The lot then goes into an aluminium flight case with dividers (current full set overflows into a second case).

So if I pick up the case, it contains all rules and deck lists (in lid) as well as all player cards and a big chunk of encounter sets, all sleeved, all ready to go. Makes for a good storage solution and portable too.

I created custom boxes for all cycles with their respective deluxes and for the sagas. In them I keep the cards divided and unsleeved. It's a pretty confortable storage solution.

I have a 'bits' case from a hardware store that I keep the quests in, separated by cardboard dividers and color coded by cycle.  I'll try to post a pic.  I only keep the non-Saga quests this way because honestly I just don't play the Saga quests except with a friend.  The Saga quests are in Dragon Shield sleeve boxes.

We use one of the Broken Token organizers [http://www.thebrokentoken.com/unsleeved-card-game-organizer/] to divide the different cycles up, with small bits of cardstock that we cut out to label each one.

Unfortunately one Core Set isn't enough to store all of the encounter cards these days--but there's still plenty of space in two boxes.

Currently I have the sorted encounter and player cards in a couple of long corrugated cardboard boxes, with every encounter/quest/side quest/encounter ally card in sleeves, and am about to print out some dividers. Prepared player decks are in deck boxes, with their set of heroes. Then I have bags of unsorted encounter cards waiting to be sleeved (completely ran out of decent sleeves at the ULGS).

 

I'm in the process of designing some encounter tuck boxes, which I will continue to store in those long boxes (until I can be bothered to make cycle boxes, like Gizlivadi's). I want one tuck box for each encounter symbol, sized for sleeved cards of variable counts, and identifiable from all angles. Maybe I'll also print up some custom sphere stickers for use with player deck boxes.

 

Some of this relies on Staples actually having label sheets in stock, but I've found 200gsm paper to be decent enough for tuck boxes. If printed and treated with acrylic varnish they are about the right thickness, although I'm going to experiment with photo paper too. It's not like it's possible to make anything flimsier than the cheapest plastic Ultra-Pro deck boxes :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

I have a giant 4000 card white cardboard box that I keep all of my encounter cards, unsleeved, with white plastic dividers. However, I may have to get some more space, as I'm running out of room.

Several of us use one of the smash up big geeky boxes to hold all the encounter cards and we put them around on game days.
