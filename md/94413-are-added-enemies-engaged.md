# [Are added enemies engaged?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/94413-are-added-enemies-engaged/)

Card text on treachery card "piercing cry" from the black riders expansion:

".... or put it into play engaged with the first player"

 

In this expansion quite a few hobbit abilities trigger when you engage enemies, which goes for both optional and forced engagement, as has been previously discussed.

But when I read this treachery card I cannot help but think that the act of engaging has been skipped entirely.

Much like when a card is added to the staging area it does not trigger it´s When Revealed effects unless it is specifically stated that the card is to be revealed.

Anyone have any insights to share on this?

We got an official response on this-- no idea where the thread was.  But yes, this does count as 'engagement' even though the card uses the phrase "put into play," and it will trigger all those Hobbit-y abilities.

Seconded.

I added it in my faq. It was on this forum...

Great thx for the response.

Have only recently aquired Black Riders on account of wanting to finish Morgul Vale first so I might not be updated on all the issues.
