 Any idea when we will be seeing Borimir?  I have seen the card pic...and I was under the assumption that we were getting him this time around and not Brand.  Anyway, any ideas?

I think he was coming in the Marshes pack, second to last? Next one? Can't recall.

Boromir will be the hero in the dead marshes.  As for thoughts, I am dying to load him down with Dunedain Marks and Warnings.  He won't mach Gimili's ability to chew through high end opponents in a single swing, but he can handle crowds of opponents better than anyone we have seen thus far.

Exactly, good point. This is a great addition and something that is really needed. It's something that is always frustrating about Gimli. His big swing always seems to come around so infrequently. We don't really have someone who inherantly (without attachments) can deal with multiple enemies. A little crowd control is a much welcome addition.

Here is a Boromir question for you. You are playing 4 player massing at Osgilith. Is it worth it to sacrifice Boromir in your first turn?

Yes Boromir is really promising guy. Looks like he is  the best hero since core set. I already see him in my deck.

Can't remember the exact wording on Boromir - would he work with Landroval?

No, the ability does not work with Landroval. It is the first ability (the readying one) that makes him so great, though.

Can definitely see Boromir being a favourite. Would love to see one or two more defense 3 heroes though - at least in tactics/spirit - and would have thought Boromir would be a prime candidate.

You know, when I was guessing the stats, I have come to think the attack and defense would be swapped. But as it is, I believe it works better that way. Perhaps someone like Beregond could have 3 defense if he ever comes to be a hero, which is quite unlikely.

As a solo player I am really excited about Boromir because enemy management can be a bit of a problem right now. It's mostly solved by a large number of allies and the few cards that ready others (like Unexpected Courage), but with Boromir there is no limit. With his ability you could play Gandalf to lower your threat, attack three enemies with Boromir, and still come out ahead in the threat department. He will replace Legolas in my Spirit/Tactics deck I mess around with.

Sure, the quests with multiple enemies will be especially Boromir's prime league. No other hero can deal with those better now. Borne Aloft is good to have for Gandalf to come one extra time, to keep the threat low enough.

Also, the beginnings are now easier, it could often be a disaster to get an enemy one could not defend. To raise threat by 1 in order not to get an undefended damage is a very good deal.

When Borimir was first revealed a couple of packs ago a friend and I were discussing the way heroes would be released and it looks like they're heading in the direction of (Lore-Spirit-Leadership-Tactics-Tactics-Leadership-Spirit-Lore) or (abcd-dcba). That would make things even and would make our two dwarves in khazad spirit-lore heroes!

## 17 [Untergeher on October 2, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54035-borimir-any-thoughts/?do=findComment&comment=535862)

Boromir has turned out to be very promising. I'm glad he gets the love he deserves! The release schedule of the heroes (if it is a "schedule" at all) is fine with me, although I would also have taken another lore hero, because Bilbo never got much love in our playgroup. But back to Boromir: Love his abilities - not only flavor-wise, but also the mechanics behind it. I will certainly try using him in my Spirit/Tactics deck (alongside Eowyn and Dunhere) which is pretty good a threat management...

## 18 [Titan on October 2, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54035-borimir-any-thoughts/?do=findComment&comment=535866)

I can see Boromir's second ability as a "closer" type of effect. As in you may have 1-2 enemies to defeat and you can win the game. You can sacrifice Boromir and be done right there and then. This could happen right after the attack phase when those enemies are already wounded and ready to be killed. I'm bummed that this effect doesn't work with Landroval's effect, although I can see how that could be a bit overpowered. Tactics is getting much needed love. Obviously, the first effect combos well with spirit and their threat reducing abilities.

## 19 [DurinIII on October 2, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54035-borimir-any-thoughts/?do=findComment&comment=535869)

 Nice discussion guys. So, I think Bilbo is just too underpowered for his cost.

You wouldn't think that if he were a 6 though would you?  I'm convinced it's a mistake and they were so behind on production for HfG that they decided to let it go.

## 21 [lleimmoen on October 2, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54035-borimir-any-thoughts/?do=findComment&comment=535950)

I am there with you on Bilbo. He is way too weak. Should not be so. Him and Glorfindel are two of very few flaws I see about the game which I totally admire.

As for Boromir, I think his best suited companions are Eowyn & Imrahil. Horn of Gondor is well fit there for the "leaving play" strategy.

## 22 [DurinIII on October 2, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54035-borimir-any-thoughts/?do=findComment&comment=536010)

 Yeah...if Bilbo were a 6 he would be worth it for sure! I mean, yes, the extra card is nice, but why not just play Beravor for 1 starting threat more and get an extra willpower, attack, 2 extra life, and the option to draw 2 cards each turn?  Bilbo looks very unplayable next to this non-plotline gal. grrrr.

I actually use Bilbo in my multi-player games and he works fairly well.  Sure, he could be a 7 threat hero instead of 9...but he isn't useless.  The card draw is nice for the team and you can still use him to quest or defend if need be.

## 24 [lleimmoen on October 3, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54035-borimir-any-thoughts/?do=findComment&comment=536129)

Bilbo is not useless in the game. But he was the BIG thing in the novel. Game-wise, the comparison with Beravor is there, and he pales into shadow. Unless you want to have both, I really cannot see choosing him instead of the chick.

## 25 [Eryx_UK on October 3, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54035-borimir-any-thoughts/?do=findComment&comment=536170)

I would rather take Bilbo over Berevor any day. Bilbo's automatic card draw is far better than exhausting a hero for card drawing as then you are a hero down for other actions.

Same reason why I don't rate Boromir. He's good but his second ability is pointless. You end up a hero down and at present there is only one card to bring a dead hero back. 

## 26 [Untergeher on October 3, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54035-borimir-any-thoughts/?do=findComment&comment=536175)

I really wanted to like Bilbo, but I just can't get over the fact that his starting threat is so high compared to his stats. Maybe they figured they had to raise his threat for an extra 3 points, because his ability doesn't require him to exhaust. I don't know. With all the other heroes it is very transparent (willpower+attack+defense+hipoints) , but for Bilbo they changed their formula. I don't think that it was a mistake...

Usually I take a flavorful card that maybe isn't the most powerful in the game anyday... But Bilbo hasn't convinced me yet. But who knows? Maybe I'm just freaked out but the massive wig he's wearing in the picture ;-)

Boromir will see some playtime - that I know already! Sure, his second ability is nothing you want to use very often, but imho his first ability alone is powerful enough to include him in a deck or two!

## 27 [lleimmoen on October 3, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54035-borimir-any-thoughts/?do=findComment&comment=536177)

Consider this, you can only use Beravor's ability every other round and still get the same number of cards as for Bilbo's. In the other round she can quest for 2 as Bilbo can quest in two rounds, and she's less vulnerable, can even take undefended damage. But then, consider Unexpected Courage, and try it out in a game or two, if you then still prefer to play with Bilbo, you probably want to make things harder on yourself.

As for Boromir, as said above, it is the first ability that makes him great. The other is just an addition.

 lleimmoen: my sentiments exactly on everything you just said. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] I wish he was more comparable game wise to the other Heroes, simply because it's Bilbo, and he is such a main character.

Glad. Haha. I so wish Glorfindel and Bilbo Baggins were better, they are my favourite characters, and it hurts I cannot see them shine in the game I enjoy so much.

Hey my friend let me disagree with you about Glorifindel.  i also use to think Gorifindel is useless but...... Since Rhosgobel come and my deck Gimly/Theodred/Eowyn cannon do nothing against this quest i start to build up another deck. But This new deck i wont to design to beat all Quests Including Rhosgobel. And i get this deck. Glofifindel/Theored/Eowyn. This deck is much better than my previous deck. And very important guy is Glorifindel. I have low starting threat 27 so i can manage the troll in Anduin. Now i change my mind to Glorifindel. He is good really good Hero.

Glad for you. And I see what you are saying, I have myself used Glorfindel to some good effect. He is certainly playable. My point is a bit different, and perhaps I did not express it right this time (although I had before), Glorfindel was one of the mightiest of this era, perhaps The Mightiest, especially as a warrior. He had defeated a Balrog, he scared off the Witch-king and later three of the Nazgul alone! Now, that should have translated into the stats. Well, he has got attack 3 and there are already five other heroes with that stat. He has got willpower 3 and Eowyn has 4, with a boosting ability and much lower threat. There is where my concerns lie. I would not mind if Glorfindel were 4/4/2 + 4 hp for the price of 14. He would be very hard to play but thematicaly much more correct.

One a side note, I hope there are card coming for him. Especially we should see Asfaloth!

I am interested to see more cards come out that have a bonus to specific heroes. As of right now we have Celebrian's Stone for Aragorn, but not much else. I hope they use the larger expansions to provide these since they have more player cards in them. I would like to see Sting with a mechanic like "+1 to defense when defending against an orc. If bearer is a hobbit, +1 to attack."

For Boromir (who was the original topic) I would like to see his shield. It could give a plus to defense for everyone (maybe +1), but additional hit points if wielded by Boromir (+2).  

## 35 [scottindeed on October 3, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54035-borimir-any-thoughts/?do=findComment&comment=536412)

 Sorry to duck the Boromir discussion again but...  I've been using Glorfindal and Bilbo very successfully in my two-fisted decks.  Bilbo works great for me because his card draw ability swaps player every turn.  Once the decks get going I use him as my chief defender by piling him up with Burning Brand, Dunedain Warnings and Protector of Lorien.  Glorfindal I use for questing where his high hit points can absorb the nastier when revealed effects.  I tend to then use Unexpected Courage on him to ready him for Attacking.

I like the look of Boromir, but can't see him replacing Legolas in my Leadership/Tactics deck.

## 36 [Metropolis Games on October 3, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54035-borimir-any-thoughts/?do=findComment&comment=536472)

Bilbo: Very strong hint about the appearance of Sting in the first Dead Marshes preview - this is good as so far i haven't played him at all.

Glorfindel: I'm not a good enough player to start with that high a threat usually but I've tried him to good effect a couple of times - just prefer Eowyn.

Boromir: really looking forward to playing with him - looking forward to more viable Gondor strategies in general.

It was the same Glorfindel who died indeed in the clash. He later left Mandos and returned to Middle-earth, either with the Istari or some time before them in the Third Age.

As good as Boromir's card is, I am a bit sad there is no combo with him and Horn of Gondor, it would seem natural as there is one with Aragorn and Celebrian's Stone. The attachment could have a response: If attached hero is Boromir, when a character leaves play, exhaust him to gain 1 additional resource to his pool.

It would not be too strong and work rather nicely with his ability to ready when need is dire.
