 This card is really the "make or break" of this entire Emyn Muil scenario.  Draw a rockslide when everyone is exhausted to quest and a bunch of people die, don't draw one and you do fine. I hate this scenario so much for it's lame mechanics and ridiculous solution to hurting players..."Let's just deal two damage to everything with this card, that'll stop em." Well it certainly does do that.

The solution is simple, do not quest with everyone. While you have to quest a lot before you clear starting locations, once this is done you can just throw a a couple of allies to quest, so your heroes will be relatively safe.

Another solution would be A Test of Will or Eleanor

 yeah, I don't see the problem... in rhosgobel you have a similiar card.... and necromancer's reach can kill you too, even if it's just one damage...

 Hahaha, you're good! I just got really frustrated with this card...had all my guys questing including 2 Citadel Guard 2 Keen-eyed Tooks Haldir, Gloin (who had a wound) Aragorn (who had a wound) and Frodo (I converted his wounds to threat of course), but man, the rockslide killed 4 allies, and almost killed two more...made it impossible for me to catch back up to the darn location threat level.
