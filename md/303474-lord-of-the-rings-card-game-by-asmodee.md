I've seen a you tube trailer for this and it's now available on xbox one at £20.99 and available on PS4, and Steam. 

Small print states free expandable encounter packs. 

Has anybody purchased this new release of the steam game that was launched ages ago in various stages of production?

I mean it's still the same game, anyone who purchased it ages ago has the new version.

It's still a strange adventure/combat Hearthstone hybrid type thing. I always mean to put more time into it but would rather play the physical LCG.

I'm sure its a decent game and there are people who are enjoying it so good for them. I think in particular people that haven't played the physical LCG will enjoy it more.

I've always enjoyed it. Initially I wondered whether it was structurally too simple but they've shown with recent expansions and player cards that there's plenty of available scope in the system. Mechanically it isn't much like the paper card game, but that's not a bad thing.

I have played the game, and it's enjoyable. There's a fair amount of content you get for £20.99, especially since they've now gone and essentially made the first three campaigns free.

Played it a while since it was early release.  It's... okay.  It's not the same game, for better or worse.  The back-and-forth turn-based structure sometimes feels frustratingly limited (every action you take is followed by an enemy action).  Protecting a vulnerable asset requires that I take immediate action and postpone all other actions.  This leads to a sense that I need to treat all assets as expendable in order to execute more elaborate tactics.  This becomes frustrating when I often put an ally or attachment into play knowing it is probably going to be gone with the enemy's next action (spend an action just to make the enemy waste his to undo mine).  I'm not saying it isn't balanced per se, but it encourages simpler tactics and a more cavalier attitude toward your cards in play.  

It's a strange thing.  In the end, I find it less comfortable to play than the physical card game which mostly outweighs the convenience of the digital platform.

Edit:  I do need to commend the designers for not remaking the physical game and for taking some risks and embracing the medium to build a unique product.

There is actually a deceptively deep strategic element -- spanning both play and deck construction -- created by the back-and-forth play of the digital game that is completely absent from the tabletop version. I wrote a whole Steam guide [https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1884235711] on this strategy of action advantage and board control. The problem for the game, however, is it takes quite a while before this level of strategy becomes apparent, let alone manipulable, by new players to the game.

You are absolutely right.  There is certainly a strategic design there.  But I do stand by my original take that it feels frustratingly limited to me at least.  The more open-ended feeling from the tabletop game where you assess your options, build up your tactic for the turn, then execute and react is simply not there.  It's just a different game - as I said - for better or worse.  Some will enjoy the new pace and structure and others won't.  I enjoy the format of the tabletop game to the point where the digital felt confining and it was not what I wanted.  The original lets me, in some small way, play around in the world of Middle-Earth through these scenarios.  The digital had me much more strictly playing the rules to gain - as you said - action advantage, rather than enjoying the lore and imagining the adventure represented by the ingredients.  

Not a bad game in design or balance, but it's not the same.  Potential buyers: just do your homework and check it out before you buy.  FYI, that's a good guide you've got there.

This is true. What the digital game lacks is real immersion in the story, at least as far as the game play goes. The backstory, visuals, and audio voice-over help with the theme, though.

The digital game, for me, is not even close to the quality of the physical card game. That being said I still was compelled enough to play through all the missions. It needs polish, and I honestly cant put my finger on exactly what would get it up to snuff, but it is hard to envision it ever being remotely on the level of the physical game- though that is mainly me praising the LCG as opposed to saying the digital version has no potential.
