There is some icon in this game, some I understand what they are, other... I have some doubt.

 

As I see it :

 1.  Progress token - some footprints on dirt
 2.  Damage token - some open wound
 3.  Ressource token - ?????
 4.  Threat icon - sauron's helm ?
 5.  Willpower icon - a sun ?
 6.  Attack icon - obviously two axes crossed.
 7.  Defense icon - obviously a shield.
 8.  Lore icon - a book, any book ?
 9.  Leadership icon - obviously Gandalf's rune, why is gandalf not leadership then ?
 10. Tactic icon - a sword, maybe sword that is broken ?
 11. Spirit icon - ?????
 12. Fellowship icon - obviously the one ring
 13. Baggins icon - obviously a pipe
 14. Scenario icons - nothing here that comes to mind
 15. "Pack" icons - I found ringmaker's cycle icon a bit obscure...

 

also : why is there no icon for hit point and hero threat ? 

 

I lake lotr lore, so that's why I'm missing ressource token and spirit icon.

What do you think ? do you wonder what some icons are ?

3. The resource icon reminds me of chain mail, at least around the edges

 

11. The spirit icon is a snowflake at first glance, but possibly a point of bright light (like a star)?

Maybe the spirit icon is Earendil's star?

The Ring-maker symbol is the Star of the House of Feanor, as seen on the Doors of Durin. The Tactics icon is hardly a the STWB, as it is Leadership in the card game and, of course, it was rather useless to fight with. Obviously it's just any sword that was cut to display the hilt.

Maybe I'm alone in this thought, but I always thought of the threat level icon as the tip of Barad-Dur.... Or an upside down crab

Certainly an upside down crab, no doubt there.

Lore is just a book, because lore can be found in books.

Tactics is just a sword, because you fight with swords.

Why leadership has gandalficon.. Maybe because Gandalf was at first somewhat the leader of the Fellowship.

Spirit is probably just a star, for stars shine bright as like the Light of Earendil or Valinor and those lights give us(Free Folk) spirit. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Willpower indeed looks like a sun, I would give it a samelike description as Spirit.

And joking aside, the threat icon looks indeed a bit like Barad-dur( or at least I could imagine it lokking like that) but at least it looks dark and bad.

Gandalificon!  I like this word!  Although it sounds like a book dedicated to the worship of Gandalf.  Perhaps we will see the emergence of a new sect after the release of The Road Darkens.

It shouldn't help that sauron might have make his tower and his casque with the same design in mind, like saruman's staff is shaped like Orthanc...

Maybe it is just a crab after all.

 

The star of earendil is a very good match for the spirit icon.

 

But ressource icon...

The resource icon looks like a buckler shield, but then again, it could be some very basic manner of coin...perhaps?

I think the resource token is just supposed to be some kind of coin. Since it's a generic coin, it doesn't have a picture of a president or anything, but it has a fancy ridge. It might be some kind of silvery or clear gem in the middle, which would give it that reflection from the curvature.
