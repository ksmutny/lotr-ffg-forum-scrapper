Hey all, just started playing and had a few questions.

1) Since I'll only be playing 3-4 player games, I'm assuming it isnt the end of the world to play it single sphere. How would the expansions work? Do I take the cards I like from the sphere and place them in the deck as long as they dont go above 50? Or do I only use the expansion cards when I'm playing the expansion deck?

2) The Legolas card has you place two tokens on a location/quest whenever he defeats and enemy. If you pair this with the attachment that allows you to place a token on location/quest when you kill and enemy does it add together? And I'm assuming it would be the same if I put two of the swords on him?

3) It says to pick between 1-3 heroes when you pick a sphere, would there ever be a situation when you wouldn't pick three heroes?

 

Thanks in advance.

1. Just put them in the your deck. You can also go above 50 ( although decks this big tend to have a problem with card draw). You can also make decks with as many cards as you like because the 50 cards rule is not mandatory if you just play casual games. 

2. They add together. You can for instance even put 2 tokens on a quest with Legolas and if if this will finish the card....put one additional token on the next card with the blade.

3. If you want to start with a really low threat........Normally it doesn´t make a lot of sense because then you only get to resources.

The only valid reason to pick a 1- or 2-hero deck is to have a lower initial threat. This could work very well if you play a Leadership deck and get Steward of Gondor quickly enough to get 3 resources as a normal deck would have. This might be interesting to test in Solo I guess...
