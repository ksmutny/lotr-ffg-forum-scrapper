Does he look like Qui-Gon Jinn to anyone else?

Strange Weariness... or a disturbance in the Force?

It's not Qui-Gon...it's Qui-Gorn!

The beard is too long.

Agreed, but that doesn't stop me from seeing QGJ... because obviously people arent forbidden from growing their beards out more.

"The beard is long with this one" (said to the tune of : "the force is strong with this one" )

I See You

Or is it perhaps the LOTR/Taken mash-up we've all been waiting for...

 

"I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking for the Ring, I can tell you I don't have it. But what I do have are a very particular set of skills, skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let the Hobbits go now, that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you. But if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you, and I will kill you."

Haha... nice

 

“Then Bryan stooped and looked in her face, and it was indeed white as a lily, cold as frost, and hard as graven stone. But he bent and kissed her on the brow, and called her softly, saying:

'Kim, my daughter, awake! For your enemy has passed away!”
