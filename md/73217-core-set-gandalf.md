The Rulebook says that each starter deck should include 1 copy of Gandalf. It does NOT say that each deck can have only 1 copy of him in the deck, though. Can I put more than 1 (up to 3) copy of him in my deck? I'm getting real sick of that little wizard hiding deep down near the bottom of my deck every game!

Yes, you can put any card (including Gandalf, by title) up to 3 copies in your deck when you build your won customized deck.Â

Cool. Thanks for the confirmation. Just did that - and drew Gandalf on the second turn - and easily whupped Journey down the Anduin (Plus, the drawfrom the encounter deck seemed nice for once). No dead Heros, both hands finishing with a threat of 35 or less. Thanks Gandalf! (and Angus Lee!)
