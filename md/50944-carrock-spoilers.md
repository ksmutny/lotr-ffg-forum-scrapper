Thanks much, all Carrock cards can be also found at www.lotrlcg.com (except Lore Song and the Quest cards)

As far as I recall you're playing with the Polish version, dont you? How many quest cards do you have? 2 or 3? There might be an english misprint in circulation if you have 3 quest cards bc the guy who already got his hands on the English version was irritated that he found only 2 quest cards in his pack...

yes i have polish version. There are 2 quest cards. Is this correct?

## 6 [Shelfwear on August 4, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/50944-carrock-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=508842)

Its the same as the English version, then I guess thats the way it should be.

The cards are numbered and it does not look like any quest card is missing. I checked

The text on the second quest card, Against the Trolls [http://lotrlcg.com/cardFocus.php?Title=Against%20the%20Trolls], leads me to believe there should be 3.

When Revealed: Place the unique Troll cards previously set aside into the staging area.
Players cannot defeat this stage if there are any Troll enemies in play.

Compared to Beorn's Path [http://lotrlcg.com/cardFocus.php?Title=Beorns%20Path], which specificly states the player have won the game:

Players cannot defeat this stage while Ungoliant's Spawn is in play. If players defeat this stage, they have won the game.

Has anyone asked FFG yet?

Maybe it's really just two quest cards and they forgot to print the "if you beat this stage you won the game" sentence (=misprint) or maybe the next expansion (Rhosgobel) neatly continues where Carrock ended and includes quest card 3A/B etc (??)

## 11 [guciomir on August 4, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/50944-carrock-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=508967)

Guys, I'll repeat: card have good numbers. Nothing is missing.

Quests are numbered 35 and 36. And 34 (player card) and 37 (beorn) are available.

Didn't I read somewhere that one of the other Adventure packs only has 1 Quest card? Maybe that one, plus the two Carrock Quests, are meant to eventually be played together to form a full 3 card Quest like we're used to.

But for now we just play the 2 card Quest?

 I'm pretty sure it's just two quest cards.  I haven't seen it, but there's nothing that says quests must have three stages.  That just happens to be all we've seen.

Quest is very hard and it needs completely different tactic (tried solo so far). First of all you don't want to finish stage 1B , because flipping to stage 2B means you have to face 4 trolls (10hp, big armor, big attack, when they attack threat goes up 3 for each attacking troll). The fight is so devastating that you need to prepare for it. But it is not easy, you may accidently complete 1B (only 7 progress needed) and you are dead. Or sooner or later you will encounter sacked card and this is like instant kill of one of the hereos (1 hero is trapped and can do absolutely anything until 1 troll is killed, this also means that your preparation phase for the troll fight is much much harder, especially if you play 2 or 3 sphere deck). Then, you need to also have low threat since when 4 trolls are attacking your threat will go up 12. It is not easy to lower your threat below 34 and pick trolls 1 by one because each troll have threat 2 so once they hit the board, the questing becomes quite hard and encounter deck have some more cards that can instantly rise the threat resulting in a nighmare fight.

 

Obviously, just like anduin quest, players will find answers how to beat the quest constantly. However, I feel that deck that beats Carrock may have trouble beating other scenarios, so optimising the deck so it can beat multiple scenarios will be becoming harder and harder with each expansion.
