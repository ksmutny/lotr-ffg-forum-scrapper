Well guys, I am completely impressed with this set like all the others.  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] I have to say that the art in this set is my favorite so far, as well as the effects of the player cards and encounter cards.  The enemies are quite fierce and scary and the player cards are insanely good!  Yay! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 I live just down the street from the FFG Games center and bought my copy of Khazad-Dum tonight and am so excited. I'm surprised the box is so small. I imagined it would be the same size box as the core set. I'm very happy with it so far and can't wait to get started!

Yea the art for the achient relics cycle for CoC is off the chain as well.. FFG has really stepped up the quality of the art.... the new cards that are coming out look so great. LIke check the new warhammer as well. I would check aGoT but ... well who cares abotu aGoTs :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

Mine finally arrived today, I am so thrilled! I spent most of the morning just basking in its greatness - the whole thing looks absolutely gorgeous, if a little scary. First impression is that a lot of work has gone into making the scenarios in this box each a whole different experience from the core set and each of the Shadows of Mirkwood packs, which is really good. I was even more pleased to find that the quests form a sort of ongoing narrative, so you could play all three as part of a super-quest (though, looking at some of the encounter cards, you may not actually survive this...)

So I finally played the first scenario this afternoon, with the Dwarf-deck that I had constructed at the beginning of December when I hoped I'd be able to play it before xmas. The big drawback to that is that the deck was made before I knew what I would need to overcome, but therein also lies the fun. I actually managed to survive the first scenario for pretty much the entire encounter deck, though eventually my threat just got out of control and I wound up defeated while still on stage 1B. The new mechanics are really great, I have to admit, even if this has thrashed me roundly! The whole feel is just completely different from what we've had so far from this game, so it feels like a whole new box of games rather than an expansion. Like the big boxes to Runebound, or something.

I must admit to being a little underwhelmed by the new player cards, in particular I don't feel I've been properly equipped to deal with the deadly dark of Moria, but that is more than likely down to inexperience with this set. And the upcoming dwarven goodness of the Dwarrowdelf Cycle means I'm not exactly pulling my hair out about this.

Uh, somehow this post is turning into some sort of review, almost. Well anyway, I'll just say that I am thoroughly impressed with this box, and look forward to trying again and again with the tried-and-tested combos, as well as adding cards from the next cycle, until I can succeed down in the depths of Moria! happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]
