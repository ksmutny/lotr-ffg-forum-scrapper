So a month ago(i was going to post on the forum a long time ago but i just remembered about this:P) i was playing Steward's Fear but when i ran out of cards in the encounter deck i shuffled the the discard pile for the encounter like your supposed to, but then the cards from the underworld deck are going into the encounter deck? is this how its supposed to be or does it work like in voyage across the belagaer where it has its own discard pile?

You played it right.  From the rules insert:

 

"If a card from the underworld deck would be discarded, it is placed in the encounter deck discard pile. If a location with underworld is revealed from the encounter deck and there are no cards left in the underworld deck, then the underwold keyword has no effect."
