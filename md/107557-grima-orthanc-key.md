Can you pay the card that you are using Grima's ability with the same resource that you get by response of orthanc key?

No. Keys from Orthanc is a response with the triggered condition that you have to have raised your threat first and there is no window for the response to trigger while you are paying for the card that triggers the doomed keyword.

Ok, true. Thanks for the clarification.
