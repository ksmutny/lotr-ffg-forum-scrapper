If Cold from Angmar is attached to a quest card in play, can an undamaged hero Treebeard trigger his ability even once? How about more than once?

 

Relevant text from Cold from Angmar:

When Revealed: Each player deals 1 damage to a hero he controls. Attach Cold from Angmar to the current quest. (Counts as a Condition attachment with the text: "Treat each damaged character's printed text box as if it were blank, except for keywords and Traits.")


And Treebeard:

Action: Deal 1 damage to Treebeard to give him +1 Willpower and +1 Attack until the end of the phase. (Limit 5 times per phase.)

 

My vague thought is, you can can trigger Treebeard's action exactly once, since the whole first sentence must resolve before Cold from Angmar's essentially passive effect can kick in. But since Treebeard isn't phrased something like, "Deal X damage to give +X Willpower/Attack (X must be <=5)", you can indeed only trigger it once, since Treebeard's text box will then be treated as blank.

 

Opinions?

I agree, I think you can use it one time.  Deal the damage and finish resolving the effect (Cold from Angmar doesn't interrupt the effect's resolution), but afterward his text box is blank and you can't trigger the action again.

Disagree completely. You guys are ignoring the framework of the game itself.
It is not a response it is an action and while staging is taking place you cannot take actions only responses. You can take acions while/before committing characters to the quest or just before quest resolution but not while encounter cards are being revealed during staging. There is no window to trigger anything. If Treebeard had a response that read "whenever treebeard takes damage give him +1 willpower and +1 attack until end of phase" it would trigger but you cannot just trigger actions whenever you want...

PsychoRocka: first sentence of OP's post says, "If Cold from Angmar is attached to a quest card in play..."

 

 

Nobody is talking about interrupting the staging of Cold from Angmar.  This is a treachery card which attaches to the current quest and then stays in play.  We're talking about whether you can trigger Treebeard's action and get the benefit from it while Cold from Angmar is on the table, attached to the current quest.

Oh wow how embarrassing... no idea how I misunderstood this so badly. Thats what you get for reading and posting on the forums in a rush! My apologies to you both. I agree with both of you that you could trigger his ability once and then his text box would be rendered blank. For some stupid reason I though you were asking if it could be triggered in response to cold from angmar being revealed during stsging for who knows what reason...

> We're talking about whether you can trigger Treebeard's action and get the benefit from it while Cold from Angmar is on the table, attached to the current quest.

Really minor nitpick: Cold from Angmar's effect should remain active even if it's attached to a quest that's not the current one, like with all the side quests and such.

PsychoRocka: no worries, that sort of thing happens all the time in this game. I penned, like, an 8-paragraph rules retort for a thread earlier this month until realizing I wasn't even talking about the correct card in question. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Any offical reactions about this one?

Had the same situation with cold from Angmar and a deringle warrior.

After your help by Dain vs Witchking - where the situation is similar .. https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/216678-dain-vs-witch-king/ [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/216678-dain-vs-witch-king/]... what do you think about cold form Angmar and Treebeard Hero or a defending Deringle Warrior?

I never submitted an official inquiry, as I thought the support of others' thoughts here was enough to settle the issue in my mind.
