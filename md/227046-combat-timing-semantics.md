Lately I've run into some tricky situations with combat timing that mostly revolves around the phrase "when/after [something] attacks/defends..."

 

First scenario was with Grasping Arm from the Thing in the Depths, which says "Forced: When Grasping Arm attacks, the engaged player must exhaust a character he controls."  I know that according to the FAQ "After this enemy attacks" occurs after step 4 of combat.  But I think the Grasping Arm would trigger during step 1 when you choose attackers.  The situation also occurred where all characters were exhausted but one had Unexpected Courage and I'm pretty sure that in either interpretation you could use UC to ready between steps 1 and 2.

 

Second question was with Armored Destrier and shadow cards that say the defending character cannot ready until the end of round/phase.  Armored Destrier triggers "After attached hero defends against an attack..."  Would that be after step 4, or would it be after step 2 when defenders are declared.  I'm leaning towards step 4 based on the "after this enemy attacks" ruling.

"When" attacks abilities happen immediately after step 1, although I'm not sure why I'm so confident on this.  There may have been a ruling.

 

"After a hero defends" would be after step 4 in my opinion since it would say "after a hero exhausts to defend" if it was meant to be interpreted the other way.

FAQ

> Dol Guldur Beastmaster CORE 91 Should read: “Forced: When Dol Guldur Beastmaster attacks...” The additional shadow card is dealt when the Dol Guldur Beastmaster is chosen during step 1 of enemy attack resolution.
