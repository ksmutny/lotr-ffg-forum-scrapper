Hello,

 

i want to start with LOTR LCG and have 3 Question's .

 

1. Adventure Packs : Did i need to buy more then one Adventure Pack from the same kind to get everything like it is by magic for example or is in one Pack all included?

 

2. When i want to play with 3 or 4 Players i need 2 Core Sets . How is it with the Adventure Packs and Deluxe editions need i also 2 of all kind or is one enough also for a 4 player game?

 

3. Is there somehting else to take care when i want to play with 3 or 4 Players?

The format is different from a traditional CCG.  Each box contains all the same cards, so there is no need to buy multiple adventure packs.  There will be 3 copies of each player card (except for the hero-- just one copy of that).  This is true for deluxe/saga expansions as well as the little adventure packs.

 

The core set is different, and contains 1 copy of some cards, 2 copies of others, and 3 copies of others.  There is no difference between core sets, it's always the same distribution of cards-- no random factor at all.  Some people buy 2 or 3 copies of the core set in order to get 3 copies of some of those 1-copy cards in the core set.  

 

If you want to play with 3 of 4 players, you're actually fine to just have 1 core set, despite what the box suggests.  When you play, each payer gets a 'threat trackers' and uses 'resource tokens.'  With a single core set, you won't have enough threat trackers for 4 people (there are only 2 in the box), and you may run out of resource tokens during the course of play.  This is easily solved by using dice or pen and paper.
