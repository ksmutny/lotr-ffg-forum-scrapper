Just trying to play my first solo game. How do heroes buy cards. It says from the resource pool, but how much resources does a hero get to start the game in order to purchase cards?Â

You start with 0 ressources but the first phase you get to is the ressource phase so every hero gains one. Then you can spend them for allies and attachments in the following planing phase.
