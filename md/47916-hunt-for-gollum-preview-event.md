I see there's 56 stores in the US are running this, awesome!

I was just wondering if any stores had already run any formal LOTR LCG games, or how stores planned on running this event, since this game is a different style from most competitive CCGs. From what I could tell FF didn't send any specific info on how you should run it (Or is there going to be more info in the kit?). So I was curious on how people were running it.
