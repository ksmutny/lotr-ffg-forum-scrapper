The Encounter Symbol looks like the Bat Signal.

It's probably a new mechanic. My guess is that it's a Treachery that becomes a Condition Attachment.

 I would guess it has to be executed every time a card with this keyword leaves play.

Look like there will be a lot of cards with lost effect. But maybe is triggered by some shadow effect or treachery effect or when revealed effect.

For example you have 3  cards with lost effect in play. Then coming some another card which triggered lost effect of some card or maybe all of them like shadow effect of the warlord.

The german publisher told me that Khazad Dum will be released in mid feb. Also it was stated that the polish publisher has it not until end of this month.

And if that wash´t to some huge problems that could mean we won´t see the next AP so soon. ( as they did release all AP so far at the same time)

 

But who knows, maybe we´ll se Redhorn Gate at the end of the month.
