Mrs. Beorn and I will be in Portugal for the holidays and I wanted to reach out to the community and see if there are any players who hail from that beautiful country. We are happy to meet up for a game, a coffee, or some wine and cheese. I am also going to try to track down a Portuguese forum to post there as well, but I wanted to ask here just in case.

Obrigado por ouvir!

Hello Mr.Bear!

Big LOTR Fan here, i live in Portugal (Lisbon) but sadly i'm leaving tomorrow on vacations to northern Portugal regions. (Curiously enough to play LotR LCG with some friends up north!Â :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png])

When will you be visiting our country? And what cities are you visiting?

Hope you enjoy it here.
