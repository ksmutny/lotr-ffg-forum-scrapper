Ah sweet...

Red Five is exactly the same card as Thalin, however.  I really like the Star Wars theme, but it just seems like a new skin for LOTR:TCG.  Hopefully the gameplay and mechanics are different.

Agreed.  Then again, if they're the same that can save me some money since I won't be buying cards for LotR, AGoT, and SW (assuming it's good!)

I have to disagree. If Nate French is involved in this game, I think it will be fresh and exciting. (Reference his triumph of Thrones, Cthulu, and now LOTR)

I've seen alot of people complaining already that it's a Co-op game. I can see their point as the Empire would make a very good faction. However, ALL other SW games have been pvp whether it's minis, cards, or cardboard ships. If the engine is significantly different enough from LOTR, I will be buying this game when it comes out! Lately, I have been having trouble finding friends to play with so the solo option of a coop is perfect for me.

Wow, consider me blown away by this news.  What a shame that we can't play as the Empire, but ah well.

I'm very curious to see how different (or similar) this will be to LotR, which I immensely enjoy... but a reskin would indeed be pretty lame.  I've never played AGoT, W:I, or CoC, but I hear they're fairly different despite some similarities... in any case, I'll definitely be watching this newly announced release very closely.

 It seems like all the LCG's have their own special flavor of gameplay, and I'm hoping the Star Wars card game will be no different.  I'm looking forward to hearing more news about this game.

I was kind of enjoying LOTR being unique as the only co-op LCG. It's kind of a shame to have to share the spotlight with the Star Wars LCG... Hopefully it doesn't steal any passion or creativity from the design team...

I'm kind of feeling like a first born child who's younger brother just came on the scene and is stealing my attention!

I hate to admit it (because it makes me sound like a whiner), but I kinda feel the same way.  I love Star Wars, but it feels really weird to have another game that seems to have a very similar premise announced less than 4 months after LOTR was released.

Take it easy guys! I don't think they will just change the pictures and names ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

I am really excited about this and i was looking for another co-op LCG because they are so "marrige-compatible" :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Hopefully it inspires the design team and gets new ideas injected into LOTR that otherwise would never have been.  Hopefully some people seeing/trying this will get into LOTR that would not have normally and help grow the player base.  I enjoy Star Wars but have not played any Star Wars based Board/Card games.  Because this is a similar system to LOTR it definitley ups the appeal to try it.  I am sure it will work both ways.  Fingers crossed.......  and yeah everyone dislikes younger brothers ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

Haha!  Time to go make some custom cards!
