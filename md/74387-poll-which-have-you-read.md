 all of them: A B C D E F G H I

Not for a long time in some cases though, and I've only dipped a toe into the History of Middle-earth series.

## 9 [player543086 on November 16, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/74387-poll-which-have-you-read/?do=findComment&comment=724332)

 A, B, C, D, E with LOTR trilogy being the best.

## 10 [cordeirooo on November 16, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/74387-poll-which-have-you-read/?do=findComment&comment=724338)

Oh crap, there's no more time to edit. haha

 

I liked Return of the King most,  with The Fellowship of the Ring coming close.
The third book was the most exciting for me because it wrapped all the saga (obviously being the last book) in the most awesome way possible; while I wished Aragorn would die a warrior's death, him being alive made more sense in the end - I kind of like when stuff doesn't get all right in the end. I was kind of sad with the breakdown of the Fellowship and the Elves' depart, but the fact that Tolkien could make me feel something made me realize what a great literary art that was.
The First Book had my first sight of Boromir, who went to Rivendell due to a prophetic dream and having his life ended before it's time; yet, he quickly became my favorite character until I met Éowyn.

 

The creation of the Fellowship was nice too, but I quickly get bored with much explanations. While I appreciated the second book, it was the less exciting of the three, in my opinion. It had nice skirmishes and stuff, but it was almost easy to predict what would happen next. The return of Gandalf and the Westfold remaining was the best part of the book; I was seriously feeling doomed until he returned.

Read all of them except G.

Hard to pick a fave from the  LOTR three books, but if pushed would say Fellowship.

Found Silmarillion a tough read but may have to give it another go. Just read The Hobbit again (lost count of the number of times now) just to build up the anticipation for the film happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]

A B C D E F G (all but about 3 of them) H…. no "I" yet… sad.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sad.gif]

As much as I love the "core" books… the History series just gave so much depth, it was baffling.  I really loved The Children of Hurin, as it was a really good novelization of my favorite single tale from all of Tolkien's writings.  Puts Greek and Shakespearean tragedies to shame…

## 16 [richsabre on November 16, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/74387-poll-which-have-you-read/?do=findComment&comment=724375)

the history series are heavy going (i am working ….slowly….through them) but what makes them worth it i think is that every chapter or so you will come across a discarded idea tolkien had, and be like…no way! he was going to have X to that??

I suppose I ought to note that I have also read "Farmer Giles of Ham" and am in the process of reading several of his other short, non-Arda tales (Leaf by Niggle, Smith of Wootton Major, and Roverandom) which I have found to be entertaining so far.

ABCDEFHI

 and "leaf by Niggle" and "On Fairy Stories" and his complete Letters. The last two were not as rough as one might think and extreemly entertaining.

Also, if you get the chance, I highly reccomend the Tolkein course offered on iTunes. Corey Olson's essay on "How to read Tolkein and why" is particularly interesting.

 B, C, D and E.

 

 

The others are in my plans to read them, but first i will re-read the 4 above and, probably (don't kill me rich) re-see the movies and see the upcoming Hobbit movie.

## 22 [Ellareth on November 16, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/74387-poll-which-have-you-read/?do=findComment&comment=724486)

ABCDEFG for me.

 

Don't really care for children of Hurin since I think I've already read all that material in other places (or did Christopher added in some of yet another batch of unpublished work in that book?)

 

I haven't read all the HoMM yet, but as someone mentioned above, reading disregarded ideas are fun.

 

Imagine if Tolkien stuck with the idea of main character's name being Bungo Baggins.

## 23 [Angus Lee on November 16, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/74387-poll-which-have-you-read/?do=findComment&comment=724635)

Oh, I've also read Farmer Giles of Ham, but that is not Middle-earth-related.  Besides, Bilbo's Last Song is a gem.  I think this is my favourite.

well there are no duplicates as far as i know- they all deal with discarded ideas and early works

1-5 is the early stuff from pre middle earth to the shaping of the silmarillion

6-9 is the trilogy material and will be of most interest to fans of the lord of the rings

10-11 includes more stuff on the silmarillion and creation of orcs

12 wraps up the series in a sort of additional appendix

i dont have many yet, so im not sure which ones have exactly what, but i would recommend the 6-9 ones if you want to read the drafts of lotr

I think as punishment you need to play an all-Tactics deck against Emyn Muil, with Thalin, Legolas and Beorn demonio.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/demonio.gif] ! And play until you win.

A-F for me, can't recall what I've possibly read that would fit under G, so leaving that out. Silmarillion is hands down my favourite, each of the big three (Silm, Hobbit and LotR in full) are in double-digits in the times read, but Silmarillion's number starts with a 2.

## 32 [gatharion on November 18, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/74387-poll-which-have-you-read/?do=findComment&comment=725100)

 The Hobbit and the LotR books are the only ones I've read through. I've read part of the Silmirillion and Children of Hurin.

That is a positive, even though Eriador is mentioned.

However, Silmarillion is much more EPIC than LotR. Bigger and badder baddie, not some sissy who in Silmarillion gets *****-slapped by a girl and a dog gran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif] . Baddie who at least comes out to fight someone (even if only once). Battles are grander, not just orcs, orcs, a troll and more orcs, everything is turned to the 10th power, highs and lows. That silly ring in LotR? Trinket among others in terms of scale for Silmarillion's goodies. Rise and fall of greats (and the infamous) vs who, Saruman in LotR?

Agreed to both.  The part of me that loves history (I was born about 100 years too late) just loves the Sil for what it is…  the larger story that defines every little detail in The Hobbit and LOTR cycle.

I love them all, but realistically, The Hobbit is truly kid's material and just a snapshot in time of a singular (albeit influential) event.  The LOTR is obviously a bit larger in scale, but still a very specific story about a few important relationships more than anything else.  The Sil… well, the way I explain the comparisons between the LOTR and the Sil for those who have only read (or watched… sorry, Rich) the LOTR cycle is one very simple comparison (which usually goes something like this):

"You know that Balrog that was wicked awesome in Moria?  That seemed indestructable?  That took down Gandalf?  That was more ferocious than anything else in the books/movies save Sauron himself (and let's face it, Sauron didn't really DO anything other than stare really menacingly with a giant eyeball) or maybe the Witch King??  Yeah, well the bad guy in the Silmarillion (Melkor/Morgoth) has a whole bunch of those things he kept around him as his personal bodyguards…  and Sauron was just his right-hand guy."

 

Also, Sauron was a vampiric creature at one point who was bested by a girl and a dog.  This sounds much too similar to the characters in the Twilight series, so it's hard for me to think of Sauron as a real badass….

i just think theyre poor adaptions, so feel free people to reference whatever you like, no need to feel sorry for me….you can even (gasp) reference saruman falling off the top of orthanc if you like haha

on a related note im reading john howes artbook, and aparently (must have missed this) minas tirith's walls were made of black stone ….not white!

A, B, C, D, E, with some dabbling in Unfinished Tales and the Histories. Haven't got to Hurin on Bombadil yet.

I've read everything that was published (though not recently, and I miss it), except for Tolkien's letters. My favourite is definitely The Simarillion ! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Hi Rich, great poll!

I've read:

Parts of A (just the beginning bits; got sidetracked about 15% of the way in)

B (re-reading right now, before the film comes out)

C, D, E

H

Actually, a group of friends have been gathering at my place for the past several Friday evenings to listen while I read The Hobbit aloud. It's been great fun!
