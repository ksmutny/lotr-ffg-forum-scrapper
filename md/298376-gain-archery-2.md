I have a question with a card in A Shadow in the East.

If an enemy (with archery 1) gain a weapon attachement " Attached enemy gains archery 2", the enemy has now archery 2 or 3 ?

Thanks!

3. Archery stacks.

Indeed, all "numerative" keywords stack in this fashion [RR Keywords, <http://www.lotr-lcg-quest-companion.gamersdungeon.net/#Rule548 [http://www.lotr-lcg-quest-companion.gamersdungeon.net/#Rule548]>]:

Since the RR only covers things that come up in the Core set (for the most part), there are a lot of keywords not listed. If you look up the actual definition of Archery [first in the Heirs of Númenor rules], it starts:

> While a card with the archery keyword is in play…

So.
