At the mouth of Anduin, the rangers of Gondor have discovered a corsair fleet from Umbar. The pirates intended to rob the small coastal towns of Belfalas. Although the spies do not know where they will attack, they know it will happen soon.
With little time to prepare a proper defense plan, Prince Imrahil has decided to divide his forces amongst possible targets. Once the attack alarm is set, he expects to be on time with reinforcements from nearby areas to repel the enemy.

- Quest is about… fighting. Is designed to scale difficulty and game lenght based on the number of players. Also it allows players to choose their path... almost completely.
- Quest uses "Brigands" encounter set from "Heirs of Numenor".
