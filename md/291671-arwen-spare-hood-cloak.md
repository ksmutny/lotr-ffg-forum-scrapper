Can someone explain to me how the Arwen+Spare Hood & Cloak + Long Lake Trader combo works? (to get 2 uses out of Arwen right?)  Do you just need another ally whose sole purpose is to ready Arwen (so essentially a 4 card combo that results in an Arwen and a pseudo-Arwen on the table?)  I must be missing something...

Exhaust long lake trader to move spare hood to arwen.

Arwen has spare hood attached.

Exhaust arwen to move spare hood to ally long lake trader. Arwen's ability triggers. Long lake trader readies.

Repeat.

Never tried it but seems theres no limit on any of the items involved, so a way to break the game I suppose.

The Spare hood and Cloak needs to exhaust as well. And I don't think it would ready when attached to Arwen.

You need two SH&C.
