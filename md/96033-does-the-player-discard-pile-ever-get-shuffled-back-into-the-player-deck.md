I just started with this game and loving it so far (even though I keep failing the quest haha).  I have a question that I cannot find a direct answer for in the user guide or forums.

 

Question:

What happens when the player deck is empty?  Does the player's discard pile get shuffled into a new player deck?  Or, does the player deck remain empty for the rest of the game?

 

This is a general case question. I know there are some cards that allow a discarded card to be placed back into the deck.

 

The rule book "implies" that the player deck remains empty for the rest of the game:  In the Resource phase, if a player has no cards in his deck, then he does not draw.

It remains empty.  Pulling cards out of the discard pile is a powerful card effect, and I have heard Will of the West called "broken" more than once when you pair it with a deck with lots of card draw.  There is no regular game mechanic to put the players' discards back into their deck, however.

Thank you for the response.  I was hoping for better news, but do want to play the game right.  Hopefully I will get better at the game and not run out of cards before ending the game.
