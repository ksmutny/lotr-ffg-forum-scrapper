Setup in Dol Guldur. Your are revealing the encounter cards to guard the 3 objectives. Questión: if one of these cards has the keyword 'surge'..., does the new card guard the respective objective?

Nice clear discussion and answers here: http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/847345/guarded-treachery-with-surge [http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/847345/guarded-treachery-with-surge]

 

In short: no, it doesn't guard the objective.
