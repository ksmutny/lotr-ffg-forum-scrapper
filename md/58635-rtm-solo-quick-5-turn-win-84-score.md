re-tried my solo spirit deck (frodo/dunhere/eowyn) with the strategy of flying through questing and hoping nothing bad shows up- like you have a choice with this one....

actually went perfectly, 5 turns with no enemies and mainly low level locations, meant i flew through the stages hassle free....no damage....no increase in threat apart from the 4 per turn,

 

drew goblin sniper, dunhere dispatched him once then i used shadow of the past to put him back on, allowing me to throw every questing power i had into the quests while dunhere once again got rid of it.

 

in the end i had elfhelm/ eomund/ west road traveller/ riddermarks finest, and eoywn committed to questing, and used astonishing speed giving them all +2 will power, anways, my strategy worked, as there were no enemies in the staging area (admitedly through sheer luck), allowing me to finish stage 4b with a finishing threat of 44.

Actually, your last turn was a little questing overkill. It would have been safer to quest with smaller force, just in case mid range enemy shows up so you can kill it. Add 40 to score for 5 turns that you played. I like that you played shadows of the past, this card can really help in such quest.

ahhh i was a bit off with my scoring...i never usually bother so i forogt about the updated 10pnts per turn...i think 84 correct right?

 

yes it was overkill wasnt it, i knew i only had 2 more rounds before i hit 50, so i just went daft with willpower madness.....
