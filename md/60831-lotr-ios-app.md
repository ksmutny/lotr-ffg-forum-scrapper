# [LotR iOS app?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60831-lotr-ios-app/)

 Has anyone heard anything about if an iOS app for this game might be in the works like they did for Elder Sign. Gotta say I would buy an iPad just to play that. I really hope they are working on it.

Agreed. If FFG announced an iOS version of this game with the ability to add expansions as they were released I would order my new iPad within minutes of reading the announcement. And I'll still buy the card version. Think about it FFG, I'll buy everything TWICE.

 I wonder if its licensing issues that are stopping them.

A tochscreen would be perfect for this game. But the size of the screen is very limiting. I played it on lackey and my laptop screen sucks big time.

 An iOS version of OCTGN would do the trick.

I very much doubt it as this game is too complex. Just think about how many moments per turn you could do something. That would be quite hard to program without ruining the game experience. And with multiplayer it would be even harder. Also you can't communicate with your partner(s) as good as in the real game. And think about the play field. There could be so much going on that you would lose the overview quite easily. I would be quite surprised to see it on an idevice.

I agree. However, a deck-building app/tool would be great for iOS.

 1. Regarding it being too hard to automate the game functions: Who is asking for that? Just make it a virtual play surface like OCTGN and let the player enforce the game logic himself. I play solo a ton on OCTGN.

2. Regarding the screen being too busy: If you haven't already, try playing 4 player Ascension on an iPhone then let me know if you still feel the same way (seriously). I am curious to hear your thoughts after seeing how Gary Games made a very busy screen to simple and clean to follow. It's totally possible.

Yeah, a play surface type of thing, like OCTGN or Vassal or Lackey, would be great. And it would make more sense to provide that for this game, as opposed to other LCGs, being that it's ideal for solo play.

1. I think FFG wouldn't want to release an incomplete game, at least I hope so. Releasing a game on an idevice (or other technical devices) where you have to enforce the rules by yourself isn't really a game anymore. It would easily lead to less customers. And why would FFG want to program something for only a few hardcore gamers?

2. I couldn't play it myself cause I only own an iPod 1st Gen atm but what I've seen so far Ascension is still less complex than LotR. It could be possible to manage it somehow.

I don't know about the legal situation but I can imagine releasing OCTGN/Lackey/Vassal wouldn't be possible as they don't own the rights of the card images so Apple would reject it.
