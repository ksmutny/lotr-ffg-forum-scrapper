This is exciting. I wonder how it will be executed, and if there will be a new scoring system revealed. I know this has been discussed, but I am not a fan of the current system.

this might not exactly refer to tournaments, however, Game Night kits are to be used for "run demos, casual gaming, league play, ongoing campaigns, or single-day tournaments" -- so, it could be something as simple as demos, casual, or campaigns running each of a cycle's APs.

 Yeah, but with a scoring system present, I wouldn't be surprised if a few game stores implemented tournaments through OP. But then, I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't.

This is not "orginised play" they are kits for game stores to run events to advertise the FFG products.. and while they are done as events, and in a PvP game that is a comp… this has NO effect one the problems that have been discussed about why this game can nto be done as a competition. There is nothing new here.. all it is is a pack for game stores with some posters and crap in it.. no new rules, no answers to the myriad of problems .. nothing

do nto get excited.
