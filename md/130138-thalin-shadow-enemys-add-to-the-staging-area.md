# [Thalin + shadow enemy&#039;s &quot;add to the staging area&quot;](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/130138-thalin-shadow-enemys-add-to-the-staging-area/)

If Thalin commits to a quest, and then in the combat phase you get a shadow card which adds that shadow card to the staging area, does Thalin's effect apply 1 damage to it?

 

Or does Thalin's effect not apply because either:

 

a) he is not considered "committed to a quest" when it is not the quest phase

 

and/or

 

b) fllipping a shadow card is not considered "revealing it from the encounter deck"

 

?

B is true too, but A happens first.

I agree with both of Bullroarer Took's responses.

Thanks for the clarifications.

 

Is there somewhere where "A" and "B" are spelled out for us? 

 

More specifically, is there a page in the rulebook, official FAQ, or unoffical FAQ which states that characters do not remain commited to a quest once the quest phase ends?

 

And how about a rule (or FAQ) which explains what precisely is meant by "revealed from the encounter deck".  The most restrictive interpretation of that phase would be "revealed from the encounter deck as a normal encounter card draw during the quest phase"; a more liberal interpretation would be "drawn from the encounter deck at any point, and then revealed, either immediately, or as a shadow card)".  I am curious what the "correct" interpretation is, and where it is written.

"Revealed from the encounter deck" can happen during any phase, but the revealing must come directly from the encounter. Dealing or flipping a shadow card don't even count as "revealing" a card (I don't think) because I don't believe the rulebook ever even uses the word "reveal" when talking about shadow cards. I would have to look again to be certain though.

Regarding how long characters remain committed to the quest:

 

"Characters committed to a quest are considered committed to that quest through the end of the quest phase, unless removed from the quest by a card effect. They do remain exhausted once this step is complete" (rulebook p. 14).

 

Regarding what precisely is meant by "revealed from the encounter deck", see FAQ 1.22:

 

(1.22) “When Revealed” Effects
A card is only considered to be revealed if the card or
game effect causing the card to enter play specifically
uses a form of the word “reveal”.
 
Example: If the players use the Stage 3b “Don’t Leave
the Path!” (CORE 121) quest card effect to search
for a King Spider and put it into play, the “When
Revealed” effect on the King Spider will not trigger,
since the effect on “Don’t Leave the Path!” does not
specifically use a form of the word “reveal.”
 
To my knowledge, a card's Shadow effect (lower half of those cards that have Shadow effects) seldom if ever begins with "When Revealed." Shadow cards are "dealt" to players, "flipped up," and then "resolved" (rulebook p. 18). Shadow cards are not "revealed" (and I appreciate that this can appear counter-intuitive). 
 
Does this answer your questions?

The core set manual tells that cards are "revealed" during the staging step of the quest phase.  Other times that cards come out, such as when you deal out shadow cards, the language "reveal" is (purposefully) not used.  And probably of more interest to you: there is an official FAQ here [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/ffg_content/lotr-lcg/support/LotR-FAQ.pdf] that answers some questions and provides some clarification.  Of interest may be this passage:

 

(1.22) “When Revealed” Effects A card is only considered to be revealed if the card or game effect causing the card to enter play specifically uses a form of the word “reveal”. 

 

The take-home message here being: cards are "revealed" during the staging step of quest resolution; any other time a card comes into play (like, per a card effect), do not consider it to have been "revealed" unless the card effect causing it to come into play specifically used the language "reveal."

Thanks!!!

 

I need to catch up on reading all those FAQs!
