# [How To Win At Carrock](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60254-how-to-win-at-carrock/)

## 1 [jeffscottbrown on February 9, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60254-how-to-win-at-carrock/?do=findComment&comment=592396)

 I have the core set, The Hunt For Gollum and Conflict At The Carrock. I have not played Conflict At The Carrock yet but I am a little confused by the quest cards. 1 A&B is Grimbeorn's Quest. 2 A&B is Against The Trolls. There is no text on Against The Trolls which describes how to win. Do I win as soon as I put a progress token on it?

 
The reason I am questioning this is all of the other 4 quests I have include specific text on the last quest card like "If the players defeat this stage, the players have once again found a true sign of Gollum's passing, and won the game." from On The Trail (The Hunt For Gollum).
 
Thanks for any help.

Per the LOTR FAQ Version 1.2:

Q: Is Against the Trolls (SoM 32) the final stage of Conflict at the Carrock?
A: Yes.

Hope that helps. Welcome to the forums Jb!

As juicebox pointed out, this is simply a printing error that has been addressed in the FAQ. So, you win the game as soon as you defeat the stage. In order to do so, you'll need to place a progress token on the quest card and defeat all Troll enemies in play (including the four unique ones and any Hill Trolls you happen to reveal from the encounter deck).
