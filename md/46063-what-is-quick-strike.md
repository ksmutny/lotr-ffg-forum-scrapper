Is Quick Strike used to attack an enemy that is currently engaged with you before that enemy attacks? Thanks.

Depends on which character you use. If you use it with Dunhere you could attack an enemy still in the staging area for example.

Generally you can play actions after every step in the encounter and combat phases.

So you can play event cards from your hand soon after engagement checks.

The way I read it is that it allows you to attack any eligible monster without having it attack you so you don't have to defend it or deal it a shadow card. For that one attack anyway.

Okay, that's how I've been playing it,  there's definitely a gap in the rules on a lot of these cards.

I like the game though, just picked it up last week.

uhm....wow I even fail at this forum.  Well, anyway, I have been using it as an "instant" to kill an enemy that's within reach.

 Normally, the enemy has to be engaged with you or you can't legally attack it (the card is basically allowing you to attack normally anytime rather than in the correct phase.) I've played it where you get the chance to attack and kill an enemy before it attacks you, but if you do not kill it, it will still attack you and and then you will move to your regular attack phase after all enemies have attacked as normal.

Its a little cooler with characters like Dunhere, who can basically attack something in the staging area anytime rather than the combat round, or a ranged character, who can attack an enemy in front of another player (but not in the staging area.) I think its a great card if you're playing with either type of character, and pretty useful in general.

Don't worry, it's the crappy forum software that is at fault.
