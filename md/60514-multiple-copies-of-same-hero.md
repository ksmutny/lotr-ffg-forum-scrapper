# [Multiple copies of same hero...?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60514-multiple-copies-of-same-hero/)

From what I understand, you could never have 2 players using the same hero, even if you have multiple copies of the core set or an adventure pack.  They are unique, and only one copy of a unique card can be in play at any given time.

Then I see this phrase in the UNofficial FAQ, under the entry for Dunhere...:

"With the core set, there can only be one Dúnhere in play" (bottom of pg. 3)

That seems to imply to me that there are game mechanics available in adventure packs that allow more than one Dunhere in play.  What gives?  Just strange wording?  Why use the phrase "one Dunhere?"

 Just strange wording.  It's never possible to have more than one Dunhere in play (or any other hero, for that matter).

unofficial faq is rubbish.. do not use it.. it is slow to update full of superstitions and errors. While it is really good for "better" explanations of simple well understood things, never use this for complex rule interactions. If it aint from Nate.. it ait real. It is good for beginners, but in teh long rn you will end up playing with more errors reading that
