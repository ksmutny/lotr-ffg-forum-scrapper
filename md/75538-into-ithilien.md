First of all, the scenario is not broken…okay the level is more 7 or 8, but my fiend and i succes 75 % of the times this quest.

Last night when we play this quest, we arrive to what i call the infernal loop. The encounter deck left 3 card 1 treachery and two Blocking Wargs.

Blocking warg :Surge. When Revealed: Deal 1 damage to each character commited to the quest. (If the current quest has the battle or siege keyword, shuffle this card back into the encounter deck

 

Wew quest with only ally because we know that the blocking warg are there. The result is 0 treat in the stagging and all ally questing death. But his card shuffle back indefinitely. But with no one to kill, do this card stop shuffle back or we simply lost the fu… game because is a indefinitely loop…a bugg of rules and quest design ?

 

Thanks for the answer !

well if this is the only text on the cards ability then it still shuffles whether it deals damage or not, all that it requires is the siege/battle keywork

Yoyu shuffle card back after you resolve a surge keyword. So if on any point of the quest phase encounter deck is empty you shyffle all cards back.So there is no loop.

You mean that rules :

If the encounter deck is ever empty during the quest

phase, the encounter discard pile is shuffled and reset

back into the encounter deck.

 

Between shuffling the last surge card, you suffle back all encounter card into the deck.

 

Anyone can confirm this one ?

They arrived another times, left only 2 Blocking warg in the encounter deck…there is the loop finally. The encounter deck nerver empty and two same card shuffle back indefinitely. The bug are back ???

page 24 of rule book:

When an encounter card with the surge keyword is revealed during the staging step of the quest phase, reveal 1 additional card from the encounter deck. Resolve the surge keyword immediately after resolving any when revealed effects on the card

Read this as it stands and it means that blocking wargs can definately enter into an infinite loop (there are 4 of them in the deck after all). The ability that shuffles blocking wargs back into the encounter deck is a "when revealed" effect and thus take place before the surge.
