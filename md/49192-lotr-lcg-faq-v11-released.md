Looks like the new FAQ has been released.

LOTR FAQ VERSION 1.1 -- 6/28/2011 [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/ffg_content/lotr-lcg/support/lotr-lcg-faq-low-res.pdf]

Let's hope it addresses the majority of the issues players have been having. Time to go away and read it I guess happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]

My initial reaction is that this is great, with extremely explicit rulings, and I'm actually interested in trying out Nightmare mode now that we have some clear rules for how to play it!

This certainly puts to rest a lot of questions, and I look forward to more excellent updates like this in the future.

Edit: Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like they've addressed the most frequently asked question yet.  When is the Hunt for Gollum coming out! preocupado.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/preocupado.gif]

Hopefully next time they will revise the scoring system. Otherwise it looks great. Thanks FFG!

 Looks like Nightmare really is nightmare now that you need to reset the threat to max(sum of starting heroes, end threat of prior stage).  Course you get a benefit from encounter cards being recycled at the end as well.

I still like the idea where "reset" means nothing changes (threat, enemies, etc).  All you do is shuffle in the next set of encounters with the relevant unused ones from the prior quest and proceed to instructions on card 1A.  Yeah, threat reduction can help, but you don't get the benefit from encounter cards leaving play once one scenario finishes.

 The new FAQ is great: it answers every question that has been unanswered so far as far as I can tell.  I have updated my unofficial FAQ as well.

I really appreciate the new FAQ. Only one thing stood out for me: the reversal of the ruling on Chieftain Ufthak. In the first FAQ the ruling was, that he receive the resource token when he attacks, now it's after the attack (as per the card text). Interesting.

## 7 [Cidervampire on June 29, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49192-lotr-lcg-faq-v11-released/?do=findComment&comment=492651)

I'm still a little confused by the bit about attacking the same enemy twice.In the example I understand why Aragorn can attack the Hill Troll again as he has played a card to allow him to, but what gives Legolas the right to join in?
Is it
 

1 Aragorn is now a legal attacker, none of Tom’s other characters can join the attack as they cannot legally be declared as attackers without using another card effect but other players characters who have Ranged are allowed to join in.


2 Legolas can join in as he previously joined in the attack against the Hill Troll but no other characters whether they have Ranged or not can join in.


3 Aragorn is now a legal attacker and any of Tom’s other characters can join in on the attack together with any other players characters with Ranged
Does this example also mean that when Quick Strike is played other characters can join in or just other players characters with Ranged?
 

Cheers
Geoff

I quess this is because of the wording of the german card text where it is very clear that he gains the ressource token after the attack. With the old FAQ I had to decide if I play by the newest rules or by the wording on the card....

This shouldn´t really ever be a problem. The latest rulings should take precedence.

 

And on another note, I am also a little confused by Legolas suddenly attacking again.

can ranged characters now also join when i attack enemies in the staging area using quick strike?

can they join dunhere? dunhere is alone when he declares his attack. then the other player can join in with his ranged chars, so the ranged chars can attack. but dunhere is not alone anymore and therefore can't attack??

i really hope they revise this rule. the ranged keyword was pretty clear until this unlucky example. i wouldn't have even allowed a joint attack of 2 chars if both players played a quick strike (or one player plays 2).

## 11 [lleimmoen on June 29, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49192-lotr-lcg-faq-v11-released/?do=findComment&comment=492801)

Maybe all eligible characters can now join during Quick Strike. That would make the card even better. And I'd rather hope so although I think it unlikely. However, I don't see why a Ranged character should be able and a close-by character should not...

Hey the answer is clear. Legolas cannot attack with Dunhere because is nor allowed to them. Only Dunhere can attack enemies on the staging area.But he can attack and participate to attack everytime when is possible  like in normal attack even if he attack this enemy already.

I see that (1.04), the "All damage to one defender" ruling is still in place on the FAQ. Did we ever figure out what the point of having multiple defenders is if one of them takes all the damage? Or is Stand Together still just a complete waste?

## 15 [Bohemond2 on June 29, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49192-lotr-lcg-faq-v11-released/?do=findComment&comment=492976)

Stand Together let's you total the defense score of your characters before you calculate damage.

Ah, that makes the card suck way less. Cheers.

where does it say that? dunhere only states that he must attack alone (which he does) and ranged states that they may join the attack (after it has been declared alone by dunhere). dunhere doesn't say anything about future effects and ranged doesn't say anything about past effects. both rules can coexist in peace and don't affect each other.

Read the Quick strike card and you will get it. Against any eligible emeny. Legolas is not eligilble attack staging area so he cannot to participate.

Great news, just printed it out in colour! Thanks a lot FFG and Nate especially!!! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Its a bit too much for me now after getting up at 6 a.m. but  I will read through it step by step asap. What I read so far is really great.

 

Now, just one quick question for me here:

Yesterday while playing with my wife we got this "snake/dragon" monster as a shadow card. its not really important which card this is excaclty, the only imporant thing is that it was a card with Victory points on it. Now, after the shadow effect has been resolved, (in this case it was not because of quick strike ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]  ) do you place this "shadow card" back into the discard pile of the encouter deck or do you treat this card a let say a defeted hill troll and put it totally aside out of play? We put it back into the discard pile because we did not fight it as an enemy and defeat it really.

ut

And what you do is right. You put it to victory points pile only in case when is defeated as enemy or explored as location.

And when that is mentioned, the Hummerhorns card has a Victory point notation, but for some reason it is printed below the shadow effect symbol. I would guess you still get the points for defeating it........
