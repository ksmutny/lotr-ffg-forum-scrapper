# [Book of Elessar - Play Series (Update: The Uruk-hai Saga)](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/299901-book-of-elessar-play-series-update-the-uruk-hai-saga/)

## 1 [manoftomorrow010 on September 11, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/299901-book-of-elessar-play-series-update-the-uruk-hai-saga/?do=findComment&comment=3782459)

Hi all!

I started a (not so) little hobby project that combines my effort to replay, and play, every quest with Aragorn as the focus, or included in every deck.

I'm playing solo, as much as it is possible vs some quests, and yes, Aragorn will be in every deck.

I thought of it like a tome that recounts the events of his life, long after he passed, possibly compiled by Arwen and Eldarion.

I've only just started, so content includes Hunt for Gollum, but I plan to post weekly.

In addition to the quests and game themselves, I'm writing short narratives that a) act as introductions or transitions to the quests, and b) literally adapt the actual events in my games into a coherent narrative.

For example, I take notes after rewatching the game and note what enemies, locations, or treacheries, etc, may have appeared and write around them. Think of it like interactive fanfic, I guess.

Finally, I'm posting my gameplay to YouTube. There are also deck construction and theme pieces for each quest.

 

Okay, that's a lot! But, here's the link! I hope some enjoy and read along. I'll post a reply with each update. If you hate it, well, keep it to yourself ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

https://bookofelessar.wordpress.com/ [https://bookofelessar.wordpress.com/]

 

(The narrative pieces so far cover Intro to Hunt for Gollum, the Hunt for Gollum quest itself, and the transition from Hunt for Gollum to Conflict at the Carrock.)

Hi all, Friday update!

Deck construction for Conflict at the Carrock.

https://bookofelessar.wordpress.com/the-book-of-elessar/deck-construction/conflict-at-the-carrock/ [https://bookofelessar.wordpress.com/the-book-of-elessar/deck-construction/conflict-at-the-carrock/]

 

Gameplay and quest narrative should be coming by Monday.

 

I think this will be my schedule moving forward!

Sounds like a very cool project!  Should be an interesting take on the quests and story lines.

 

I'll definitely check it out.

Hi all!

Thursday update: The Carrock at Night. https://bookofelessar.wordpress.com/the-book-of-elessar/narratives/the-carrock-at-night/ [https://bookofelessar.wordpress.com/the-book-of-elessar/narratives/the-carrock-at-night/]

This narrative piece covers my actual gameplay for "Conflict at the Carrock."

I originally recorded the quest on Friday (the 13th) and over the weekend, noticed too many silly mistakes, and then, my export of the video only managed to do like 8 minutes of it. So, needless to say, it was defeated by Friday the 13th weirdness. I recorded it anew this week and wrote up the narrative.

Sorry for the wall of text, I wanted to go ahead and post it while at work, so I can't upload any images.

Gameplay should be on YouTube tomorrow!

 

Thanks!

Narrative for Into the Pit is live. This tale begins back when Aragorn was young, so it doesn't not directly follow from the last cycle. Enjoy!

Awesome play! Just wondering why Durin's Bane did not get a shadow card at 45:00? Shouldn't the deck have been reshuffled and then dealt a shadow to him? I'm probably missing something. I don't have this quest yet.

Nope! You only reshuffle the encounter deck during the Quest Phase! So if the encounter deck runs out during another phase, it remains empty until the quest phase.

In the Rules Reference on page 15 (emphasis added):

> If the encounter deck is ever out of cards during the quest phase, the encounter deck discard pile is shuffled and reset back into the encounter deck.

no worries! It was also a thing I used to mess up, too, because I naturally assumed it needed to reshuffle 🙂

Thanks for watching!

It's been a tough time, but I managed to get back to my saga campaign series. This is Journey in the Dark with a Fellowship contract deck. Enjoy!

Not an Aragorn series video, or even an Aragorn deck! I felt like playing more random decks on my channel, especially since this is my Rohan creation, which has been through a lot of the quests in the game. I am replaying the entire Haradrim cycle with my physical cards at home, solo, using this deck, and figured I'd showcase it in a couple games.

I've got a new Saga video featuring a thematic Three Hunters contract deck against The Uruk-hai!
