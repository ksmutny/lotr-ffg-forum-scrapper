If Zigil Miner discards an X-costed card like Stand and Fight, does it count as 0 cost and provide a match, if you had named 0 when you triggered his response?

I would guess yes, since the Miner's text does not says "printed cost," but I'm not sure.

 

Thanks for your thoughts!

That's how I play it.

(Emphasis added.) By the transitive property of equality, I believe you to be correct: it provides a match.
