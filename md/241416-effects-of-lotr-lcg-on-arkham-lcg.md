# [Effects of LOTR LCG on Arkham LCG](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/241416-effects-of-lotr-lcg-on-arkham-lcg/)

## 1 [Crusaderlord on January 31, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/241416-effects-of-lotr-lcg-on-arkham-lcg/?do=findComment&comment=2617751)

A question i am currently grappling with is whether my long term enjoyment of LOTR LCG is stopping me from fully loving Arkham at the moment. I am a solo player of both games and dont dual play with either.

I have bought Arkham core, Dunwich and Rougarou and have played the core set and one of the Dunwich scenarios but i am finding it much harder to get enthusiastic enough to set up the next Arkham game. I was really excited by Arkham initially upon purchase as it should have provided me the ultimate solo experience, but after a few plays of the core set i cant help but feel a little downbeat about the game. In comparative terms it is still one of better games i own but i am deciding whether to drop out now and just focus again on LOTR.

 * Arkham set up seems a bit more fiddly. I know it really is not that much different at all, but i liked the simplicity of grabbing a set of encounter cards and getting going. Setting up locations with the right places attached is a bit more effort. Also i know LOTR player cards so well that the deck building is not overly task heavy, i currently dont know Arkham cards well so it takes a bit of effort to work out which ones i need - this is temporary of course.
 * Mechanics. I do prefer the way LOTR uses all its mechanics within its card decks, i am already becoming a little tired keeping pulling counters from a bag to pass or fail. I do like that you can tailor the difficulty this way but it isnt as smooth running as LOTR.
 * Battles with monsters just feel slightly flat with Arkham at the moment, whereas in LOTR you feel you are building up during the game to take on the largest enemy. Mostly i find taking on the big boss in Arkham or having multiple enemies overly hard to manage and then often you can just run away or quit. I now realising how good the shadow effect mechanic is and how it always holds that unknown trigger to make you breathe a sigh of relief or cry in despair which is much more engaging to deal with.
 * The RPG aspect may not suit me, i largely prefer one off battles against a certain scenario - if i understand right, in order to play a one off against a later cycle pack scenario in Arkham i have to work through the results of a load of previous scenarios first to see what my character is first. This is an elaborate set up requirement for sure.
 * I am just getting too old - it could just come down to this, LOTR was enough for my brain to take on and enjoy and trying to layer in another similar game with its own rules system and i think more to remember in terms of triggers (i always forget the enemy response attack thing) just has become a bit too much. I have found this before occasionally - i sold Mage Knight eventually for this reason.

I suppose i was just interested to see what others who have both games thought. I am certainly of the opinion that Arkham is good, but i am worried that i cant cope with two LCG games in tandem. I am undecided at the moment but thinking of just dropping Arkham and going with Sands of Harad and that cycle instead.

Setup in Arkham is indeed a bit more fiddly, but it is a price for a more deep and polished narrative, and I freaking enjoy that.

Arkham Horror had to make the result of it's various interactions unclear, and the way I see it, their only viable alternative were dice. Chaos bag is a more creative and customize-able solution which I whole-heartedly approve of.

They're flat in both games, but unlike LotR LCG, Arkham allows you to elude your enemies by dodging them. You can argue that LotR has similar thing in form of staging area and engagement cost, but the thing is that in Arkham both fighting and evading are core mechanics, while in LotR "evading" is fully manipulated by card effects, and if you're out of them and your threat is high enough - enemy will simply come down and start pounding at you, and there'll be nothing you'll be able to do about it but take the pounding and pound back. As for the shadow cards, that tension is replaced, once again, by a CHAOS bag during an attack. Just like in LotR you have no uncertainty during attacking enemies, in Arkham there is no uncertainty when enemies attack you.

I believe there are proper rules for setting up a stand-alone scenario regardless of how deep in campaign it is situated. I might be wrong, as I've never played standalones aside from the very first one to introduce peps into the game.

Enemies attack in response only if you fail an attack against them and they have a Retaliate keyword. LotR has plenty of keywords of his own, if you manage to forget retaliate, you must be forgetting many of the LotR's forced triggers too, right?

I like both games, I have been thinking about them a lot lately.

+  The way the narrative unfolds in Arkham is superior.   Anything from having flavortext on the locations, to parts of the story on the Act and Agenda cards, it really helps the story flow.  LotR does this a bit with quest cards, but it's much more pronounced in AH.  That being said, I do really very much enjoy the Saga LotR campaign, and I feel that it is at least equal if not better than AH where story is concerned.  Also, once you've played each AH mission a few times, the storytelling gets a little less important and you want some solid gameplay to back it up.

+  The Chaos Bag.   Ugh.   I dunno about this one.  Most games you have to have some element of luck.  In LotR it is what cards you draw from your deck, and how the encounter deck flips.  In AH it's both of those things plus the Chaos Bag.   I don't know which I hate more, the fact that you can auto-fail a check when you are 8 points over the difficulty, or that it's certain to be used as a substitute for good scenario design.  Scenario too easy?   Oh, well just add more bad tokens to the chaos bag!  Too hard?  Put it on easy mode!   I'm not saying every LotR scenario is spot on in terms of difficulty, but it seems to me that rather than learning the lessons of LotR and trying to really write every scenario at a certain difficulty, they just decided that investigators could randomly suck more and that would due for a difficulty mechanic.

+  Player interaction.   I was sorely disappointed in AH in terms of player interaction.   Now, there is some, but for succeeding a game like LotR which is so robust with player interaction, it feels a bit muted.   You can't trade items without a special card (even then it's a bit of a flop),  you don't have hardly any control over who an enemy engages.  Although you can contribute edge cards to other players if you are in the same location, that's about as much help as you can do.   I really miss the dynamics of Ranged and Sentinel keywords, and being able to play your cards on other players characters.

+Deckbuilding.   I think I give AH the win in the deckbuilding area.   I really enjoy LotR deckbuilding, but AH deckbuilding is a lot more thematic.  As someone who always tries to  make thematic lotR decks, I like the fact that AH decks have a bit more guidance.  I like each card belonging to a certain class which associates with certain characters.  I like the system of cards costing experience points, and leveling up.    It gives the AH campaign the Saga feel, only it's the whole game, not just the Saga boxes.  Currently there aren't a whole lot of options for AH, but thats because the game is so new.  I really look forward to AH deckbuilding once we have a few more cards.

I believe he/she means the attacks of opportunity.

As I've said elsewhere, I like everything about Arkham Horror except playing it.  It's not even just all the setup.  I would have a game ready to go on my card table and it would sit there for days.  AH really doesn't play nice with single handed solo in my opinion, there is just so much you need to do in a game and only so many actions you are allowed to take.

I've got my complete collection up for sale now.  (2 core, Dunwich, Curse & Carnevale). It was such a relief getting everything back in the boxes.  I'm not afraid for LotR, but even if it were to stop I wouldn't regret my decision.  ( Sorry Feonix)

I've been enjoying both.  Arkham does a great job with locations and the whole campaign aspect.  I love the multiple resolutions and the fact that your campaign continues even if you don't "win" the scenario.  I've also been pleasantly surprised with the deck building.  I thought it would be far inferior to LotR, but IMO it is only mildly inferior.

One thing I have noticed is that, like Bullroarer said, one-handed solo just isn't very good.  All it takes is one nasty enemy and either a weakness or no weapon/shriveling and you are bogged down completely.  Many investigators just don't work in solo.  I'm not a huge fan of solo LotR either, but I will still play that way every once in a while.  After two solo runs through the core campaign, I have lost all desire to play solo.  I haven't figured out why I dislike it so much.  Even though there is limited direct player interaction in multiplayer, I feel like there are still a lot of group decisions to be made and discussions to have.

Opportunities find the one who seeks them. Just as playing single handed solo LotR, you need a well-rounded hero to succeed in solo. Yet, I had success with different kind of characters outfiddeted to achieve their goals in different ways. Game definetely gives you various opportunities, if you are willing to explore them - that is up to you.

Oh yes I meant the attacks of opportunities in my first post. I often forget about those.

Well it seems I am not totally alone in the way Arkham is coming across - I am not ready to throw in the towel just yet. I may just be finding Arkham a little over bearing to keep on top of, so will give it another go when I feel ready. However I have a hunch that my mind doesn't want to mix up two LCG games at once and try to keep on top of all the different deck building of each so I may well decide to stay with LOTR only. I think the next few games of Arkham will be critical ones to decide on my future purchases. Note I don't always find LOTR a joy to solo play, but I do find I have the stamina and desire to keep coming back to many scenarios and have another go. I just haven't felt this with Arkham yet and it isn't the theme, I think its the mechanics the game uses.

Just had a thought - the one element of LOTR I really didn't take to was the time mechanic in some of the Isengard scenarios - maybe I am feeling too much of this in Arkham - being rushed to complete a quest before the next card moves on or else I quit to escape is not really how I like to play these games or that satisfying, I prefer ones where I build a position up or defend solidly until I get an opening. Maybe this is a key factor alongside the drawing of tokens - which in concept I don't mind - but the reality of repeatedly digging into the bag over and over just grates a bit.

One of the things I dislike about the saga campaigns is having to keep track of the burdens and boons etc. As well as the feeling that I didn't "succeed" if I didn't get all of the available boons.

This is built into arkham.

I'm in a similar situation than you. I was ready to support a third LCG and since I love the theme and LotR I was really hyped about AH. However, after reading all the preview articles I got seriously worried that the game might not be for me.

Despite that, I got a core set and tried the game for myself. Didn't ejoy the limited number of actions that restrict what cards can I play and when each turn, but I could get used to (and after the card grows, the release of more fast cards will help with that).

But what I absolutelly hated is how the randomness works in this game. Neither the chaos bag or the encounter deck worked for me. The first because it introudeces a push your luck mechanic without no means to mitigate the outcome (as of right now). You can overcommitt all your deck cards into a test and still fail due to the autofail token. It wouldn't be so much if it was not THE only game mechanic. You want to investigate? TEST. You want to fight? TEST. You want to evade? TEST. Look a NPE character appeared! TEST. Draw an encounter card? 50% = TEST. It got tiresome pretty fast. I ended up using an app as a substitute for the chaos bag and my enjoyment of the game improved a little, but still, it just bothers me too much.

And as for the ecnounter deck, I never got the impresion it gelled well with how the game worked. While in LotR is an excellent way of introducing a worthy and challanging oponent, and the shadow system is a elegant way to capture the feeling of surprise only a real oponent can give you when he plays an event in the worst time possible; the encounter deck in AH never gave me that. It just a way to add extra randomisation, but most of the time is the agenda/act and locations the ones that carry all the surprises and interesting challanges.

It doesn't help that the timing is right after you get new cards in the upkeep phase but before you can actually play them in the investigator's phase. It really annoys me that I can't get to play my new cards before I have to deal with what the encounter deck spawns. "Me: Look, I draw my weapon!" "Encounter deck: Too bad, you either take an attack to your face first (attack of opportunity) or deal with the monster I just decided to throw at you barehanded first". "Me: Look I got the only card in my deck that can help me improve my willpower to deal with those pesky encounter deck cards!" "Encounter deck: Sorry to hear that! Better make you do that test now then!". 

It all makes me feel disattatched to my deck and most of the time not caring for it or even not wanting to draw due to the weaknesses having a high chance to screw everything up.

I'm now trying the cheating variant to see if I can make the committing system work for me (because I tend to WANT to play my cards for their text, and not for some icon in a random test), and I might make some extra rules on how the encounter deck works to see if I enjoy the game more. But for now, I won't buy anything else for the game.

I completelly agree with the first 3 points but not with the deckbuilding aspect. I know that with only one core set there's no deckbuilding options at all, but so far, I haven't been excited by any of the new cards (or the old ones) to want to try and build a deck around them. I just look at them and think "meh" almost everytime.

I found out that while the more deep and polished narrative is something I liked about AH, after replaying each scenario, I couldn't care less about it. I was just looking at the mechanics and ignoring everything else.

No, there aren't. That was the first thing I checked after I got the game, because I'm not a fan of the campaign system and everyone (devs included) said that the game would be able to be played as standalone with no problem when I raised my concerns during the preview articles.

After reading the rules, I knew that was just not the case. If you want to play standalone a new chapter you just got you need to go through all the previous chapters on the campaign reading the resolutions of everyone of them and choosing the one you like the most/prefer. So basically, you need to either buy everything prior to the chapter you got or go online searching for the campaign book (which so far haven't been done for the Dunwich Legacy). I don't know how are they planning on doing that, but if they don't release the previous campaign book when the new chapter is released, then playing the new chapter as a standalone would be impossible.

I had a similar experience. I thought this game would work true solo, but after a couple of runs with different investigators I knew that I would end up playing dual handed. Basically, what made me decide that is the exploration part of the game (moving to new locations to flip them and get more clues), which is what I enjoy the most. I feel that with only one player my exploration was seriously handicapped by the limited number of action. Playing with 2 investigators allows me to cover more ground, visiting more locations and further developing the story.

Like you I don't like the campaign system either. However, I found out that redoing the scenario until I achieve the outcome I want has been working for me. It's easier to keep track of all the burdens/boons/story assets I get and allows me to try new levelled up options if the first ones didn't convinced me without having to restart the campaign.

Bcause those desicions usually come with some penalties attached. If you decide you want Lita in your deck for the third core scenario, you need to also take a Horror traume with her. You can only know that by reading the resolution of the previous scenarios. That's how they have been balancing the scenarios and what the standalone rules ask you to do. It's a lot less flexible than LotR for example, where you can play any scenario, even from a campaign, right after you got it without too much hassle

I may try the app then and see if that helps my own view of the mechanism. I am getting tired of pulling from a bag all the time, its not even that i dislike the random aspect, its the mechanic of constantly getting the tokens out breaking up the flow of the card side of the game. Going to give it another play through this weekend with Dunwich and then make a decision on the game in general.

At moment i am feeling like selling and re-investing in LOTR LCG where i still have much more to buy (Numenor & Cycle / Grey Havens & Cycle / Sands of Harad & Cycle). I thought i would want an alternative game rather than even more of LOTR but i am now reconsidering this. Also i felt LOTR was getting consistently hard to solo play but i really am not finding Arkham an easier beast at all.

A few more plays of Arkham and i decided to sell and re-invest into Sands of Harad which i have just received and wow the artwork on these cards is amazing. In the end i feel i just want to own one LCG game to solo play and just dig as deep into it as i can. I had to realise that my spare time is limited enough not to warrant having two games to decide over. I just find LOTR much smoother to play and the fights are much more interesting. I am really looking forward to playing the Sands of Harad quests.

I definitely agree that the combat is WAY more satisfying in LotR but I do like the variances allowed in AH to evade enemies.  I sometimes wish my Spirit deck could do that more reliably, but then again we have 'sentinel' and 'ranged' to deal with that.

I just went through a couple of scenarios of AH LCG in actual stealth - I evaded most of the enemies, and backstabbed/sneak attacked the essential ones. It felt very different from my first fight playthroughs, and unnaturally satisfying. I simply can't disagree more on the matter of combat.

I'm still on the fence about continuing with AH. I mean, I like the game, but maybe not enough to collect next to LotR? I don't know.

Some times a play-through feels great, and sometimes I'm like...meh... I can't put my finger on it yet really on what's off.

Maybe it's just still too early in the lifespan of the game and it needs to flesh out. We know LotR needed that.

For instance, the encounter decks are not quite there yet. They are just too small and full of bland triggers & tests. Bit boring after a few games, as you get hit with the same cards over and over. They need to get bigger c.q. with more variety. LotR encounter sets seem to breathe more for now.

One thing I dislike: the auto fail token. Sucks. It's just no fun. I do use it, but when I draw it I just sigh or go bleh.

 

Like others stated, the game is not really great for solo. I quickly started playing 2 or even 3 handed. Worked way better and a lot more fun.

Anyway, I might just try your Wendy way John, sounds like a different take; and I need to give Wendy another go as I only played her once as she's my least favorite.

I don't think this is a fair assessment. As far as encounter decks go, yes strictly speaking, AH has smaller decks -25-30, on average, compared to (a rough glance at Hall of Beorn) 35-50 for LOTR. However, the difference is variety. LOTR might have more cards, but 5 of those will be Goblin Swordsmen, or Underworld Dissident, or Savage Trollspawn. I don't think AH has an encounter card that's more than a 3x in a single deck. But this makes the game harder. As any card gamer knows, a tighter deck means easier combos. Think of the encounter deck not as random Orcs thrown in your way, but a simulated AI. He gets to bring a well-constructed deck, and a small deck means those annoying combos go off easier. It might seem repetitive, but it does heighten the tension of each card draw. You also cycle through LOTR encounter decks faster with the shadow cards, so it makes sense you need to have more cards so you don't shuffle every two or three rounds.

As for the autofail, that's really no different than cards like The Nine Are Abroad, Biting Wind, or Sleeping Sentry, or Sudden Pitfall, which can basically be autofail. However, instead of just losing one test, these are cards that can quite literally cost you the entire game. Or shadow effects like "If the defending character is an ally, discard it from play", or "Until the end of the round, this enemy cannot take damage". I think the randomness is just as annoying in both games, and also not fair to see the tentacle token as "no fun" but insta-death LOTR encounter cards as OK.

Here's the important difference: In Arkham, if I autofail a critical test, I just sigh but look for other options. You can resign, you can fight well enough to earn some XP regardless, you can find alternative paths to resolution. You don't need to "win". You still get to move on. However, in LOTR where each scenario is played as a standalone, if on turn 2 I get a card like one of the ones above and it's impossible to win..... I have no options. There's no "well you didn't win but you did well enough!" resolution to work towards. There's no point in continuing an LOTR game that's become a lost cause, except maybe for personal benefit and experience.

I haven't played Arkham Horror, but I *hate* Sleeping Sentry and Sudden Pitfall, and I thought that was the general sentiment among LOTR players.  I see them as badly designed cards, and think it as no accident that we've seen nothing as brutal as those two since (no, I don't see Nine Are Abroad or Biting Wind as being nearly as bad).

Err sorry, but I disagree. It's just not the same thing.

Sleeping sentry and whatnot are not in every encounter deck. Yet we need to test 3+ times every turn, every game in AH with a chance to auto fail.

That, and there are simple ways to get rid of a nasty treachery or shadow card. Not (yet) so with the auto fail token unless you play as Wendy.

I see design space there, designers. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

I'm aware of all that, and as I posted above the point I was trying to make is all about more variety being a good thing in the encounter deck. A tighter deck makes easier combo's true, but I don't see the encounter deck in AH doing a lot of combos. Just test this, or add a doom to the agenda: you just lost a turn.

It doesn't just seem more repetitive in AH, it IS more repetitive. Simple as that.

Correct Dale, the consensus is that Sleeping Sentry & Sudden Pitfall are badly designed. Probably nobody likes them, but there are ways around them. The big difference is that they are not in every encounter set. Imagine if they were :blink: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_blink.png] In AH the auto fail token is part of the core mechanic. It's not a "game over" token mostly, but as I said, imho it's just not fun as there is no way (yet) to work around unless you play Wendy (or use grotesque statue as a mystic...but that thing costs 4 exp a piece and then needs to be drawn from your deck, then played for 4 resources, then you get 4 uses)

Wendy is a way around the auto-fail. As is the high level survivor event that makes you not draw chaos tokens for the turn. As does grotesque statue.

I have double tentacle using Wendy.  She reduces the odds sure, but if you've thrown your cards at the first draw you might not be able to win the second regardless of what you pull.

Curious... Are you at the end of the second for all investigators or just Wendy?  (Btw, I really wanted to like Wendy, but had the hardest time with her.)

Bad luck happens. Being able to re-draw mitiages the odds.

 

What do you mean "for all investigators"? I played her solo, no other investigator is participating in the same campaign.

I vastly prefer even brutal treacheries to Chaos bag.  

And let's be real here, we can be certain that AHLCG is going to have its share of brutal treacheries also.  So it isn't like it's LotR has brutal treacheries and AH has the Chaos bag and those somehow balance out.  AHLCG has both the brutal treacheries and the chaos bag.  I mean,  Ancient Evils?  Are you kidding me?   You lose an entire turn for every investigator. 

You stack the Chaos bag on top of that.  And the Chaos bag is much harder (impossible) to predict.  In lotr, if I see Sudden Pitfall come up during the quest phase, I know I don't have to deal with it again until I shuffle the deck.  Tentacle token isn't like that, you can always auto fail and you cant plan around it.

I disagree about not being able to plan around the auto-fail. In fact I think you must plan around it. You always have to question committing all your resources to a test because there is always a chance of failure. To me this is more interesting than committing all your characters to the quest knowing that no encounter card in the deck is going to keep you from placing X progress and winning the scenario. And yes, some encounters have bombs like Sleeping Sentry, but for most part once your board state is strong you have solved the puzzle and will eventually win the quest. You more or less just go through the motions at that point without too many tough decisions.

I don't mean to disparage LotR, it is still my preferred game, but I definitely appreciate some of the things like this they have done in Arkham.

I did. Jenny, O'Toole, Roland. All ended up sacrificing poor ol' gal, unfortunately. Jenny was the easiest, I think. She's most suited all-arounder. However, if you get into right situations, Roland is pretty facerolling with his getting clues for fithting stuff.

But suppose for a second that instead of the tentacle, the tentacle was say, -7.   The next worst token in the bag is -4 if you are on standard difficulty, excepting if there is a special scenario token that is different.   If you really want to pass a check guaranteed you could commit 7 points above the difficulty in resources/cards.   Or you could commit +4, and hope you don't draw -7.  I could maybe save myself with Close Call, or something too.  These are decisions to be made by the player, that sort of thing is fun.   All I can do is commit +4 to a critical check and hope I don't draw auto-fail and if I do, well there wasn't anything I could do about it except be luckier.

It's not just that you've lost, it's that you've committed all those resources and still lost.  It's do devastating in solo.

 

John - I agree about Jenny.  (And skids is pretty good too.).

Jenny is probably the best investigator we got. And I feel many rogue cards are really good. Most more so then those of other classes.

I'm just a huge fan of Burglary since it is one of the few 'reliable' and repeatable ways of gaining money, so I find I gravitate towards green cards (or splash green) anyways.

I was very hyped when Arkham was announced. Only just got into the original Lovecraft stories at that point and hadn't played any previous AH boardgames, but I knew FFG would deliver. I've played through the core set with my fiancée and we really enjoyed it. She prefers gameplay in AH over LOTR because of the strong story aspect and how there's barely any mental arithmetic. Once you've built up your "army of allies" in LOTR, 90% of the rest of the game consists of just keeping track of numbers, particularly in 3-4-player games. Having one investigator and up to one ally is refreshing. I also like what they've done with locations compared to LOTR, even though setup is a bit fiddly. (So can LOTR's setup be, particularly in newer scenarios where you may have a separate enemy deck and certain cards set aside etc.)

The only real downside for me when it comes to AH LCG is the deckbuilding and how it relates to story progression. On the one han I like the sense of accomplishment when you can upgrade e.g. equipment or a spell in AH, but it's all tightly connected to the narrative of a specific campaign. Deckbuilding is a lot more flexible in LOTR and I enjoy just putting a deck together and using it in any scenario without having to worry about progression. (Though we never know what the growing card pool of AH might change down the road.)

I think some of the complaints abut deck building will die down when there are more expansions out and a larger card pool to draw from, and the more synergistic multi-card combos start to emerge. I wasn't playing LotR when it came out, but wonder if there weren't similar complaints then when the core had just released, or just an expansion or two was available.

Yeah, there will still be more deck limitations, but that's also a function of the built-in campaign assumption of the game. I consider that a feature, but it depends on your approach to the game.

Campaign play also mitigates the effect of the chaos bag.  Drawing an auto-fail doesn't necessarily auto-fail the investigation, and failing the investigation doesn't end the campaign -- there are resolutions that allow continuing on for a variety of results.  That's in contrast too LotR -- die or threat out, and you're starting over. Of course, if you don't like the auto-fail token, just take it out, replace it with a -7, or whatever. The plus of the chaos bag is it is tailorable. (I'm not a huge fan of the chaos bag mechanic, if I'm honest -- I'd prefer dice if we have to have a random element on top of the cards -- but it does work and tailorability is a huge feature.)

Ultimately, they are different games, and AH has built on the mechanics from LotR.  Though I prefer the world of Middle Earth, I do prefer the game play of the AH LCG. It's less fiddly, requires less upkeep to stay on top of game state, has a superior location mechanic, and overall does a better job of intertwining story and gameplay than LotR. But then, I'm more of a thematic player who prefers single-handed solo play, so YMMV.

maybe it's my LotR colors shining through but, with regards to campaign play:

it LotR campaign (Saga) even a scenario win can often lead to an undesirable result, often by losing a hero, or failing to acquire a valuable boon or something.  In LotR you are allowed, even encouraged to replay the scenario to get the result that you want.  I think a lot of this carries over for me,  I find myself replaying AH scenarios if I didn't achieve the desired outcome (which from what I have read, is pretty common), so the point about failing a mission due to chaos bag but ultimately being ok in the campaign overall doesn't have much impact for me.  

Actually one of the things I find somewhat annoying about AH campaign is that the whole "winning" thing is a bit less clear cut.  I mean, supposing I defeat an ancient evil by sacrificing my friend to a grisly death, is that really a win?   Sorta?    the win condition on the campaign has thus far been essentially defined as how well you perform in the last scenario.  Winning earlier scenarios in the campaign can increase your odds of doing that but, in the end, the final mission is winner-take-all.  I don't like that, because it makes every other mission feel comparatively a whole lot less important.  Didn't manage to interrogate any cultists?  No prob, you shot Umordroth in the face so, well done.   Conversely, getting smushed by Umordroth results in campaign loss, no matter how well you did in the previous missions.  

 

I don't get that vibe with LotR.   Since I have to win every scenario, there doesnt seem like the last mission is massively more important than  the rest.

That does make it quite thematic, however. Case in point, the novel Innsmouth Horror.

Also to throw my two cents in, so far AH LCG seems to be much better than LotR. If they keep at least the same level, I'll stop buying LotR for good.

eh, personal preference.   I definitely don't feel AH is much better than LotR, if it's better at all.  I do enjoy both games though.  

AH win conditions may be more realistic (I wont go as far as to say it's more thematic), but I'm not sure I'm convinced it makes for a more enjoyable game.

For the Lovecraftian setting, it's far more thematic.

Somewhere along the way Lovecraft's work got gamified into shooting and blasting and beating down the horrors.  That's not Lovecraft at all.  While the LCG certainly still has that, at least there are few truly happy endings.

Then let's be honest here - you're not complaining about AH, because you're not complaining about AH.  You're complaining about your house-ruled version of AH.  I honestly don't know how many people try to play it like this, but I can say pretty confidently that it is the wrong way to play the game.  You're trying to fix the game by breaking a big part of the design in a way that doesn't actually make it any better.

You don't get that vibe with LOTR because they're different games :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]  The full campaign is one story that builds to a climax.  LOTR doesn't really do that, even in the Saga, but I think that's honestly poor design.  Chasing down a small band of orcs should not be harder than the siege of Helms Deep, but it was (at least for us).

On the Chaos Bag, I don't think the bag is bad, even with the autofail.  You make risk vs. reward choices with every test.  Sometimes it works - we pulled a true win out of Night of the Zealot by carefully applying resources to win 8 of 9 tests and win the game.  When we restarted we came down to the wire on the first scenario and failed 3 tests in a row - two due to the autofail and one because of the Elder Sign, when we needed to fail it.  But even then, we were on our last turn because we drew 3 Ancient Evils in a single turn, and let a Ghoul come to us rather than sending Zoey after it, and because we were greedy about clearing out locations for XP rather than working the scenario.  If we had another turn, we would have been able to pull it out.  Instead, we were all eaten and get to restart the campaign.  But even as we started at those red and blue tokens, it's a mistake to say they made us fail.  If we'd pushed harder, or had a Mystic who could cancel one of the Ancient Evils, etc, we would have been fine.

The important thing to recognize is that it is never required or expected to succeed at every test.  You expect some to fail, and plan accordingly.  And yes, that means that you can rarely just throw massive amounts of resources at a problem and be guaranteed to win.  That's part of balancing the risk and reward.  You know what's in the bag that can make you fail, and you decide what's worth risking, but you're never truly guaranteed safe.  But I don't truly think that feels any different from LOTR to me.  Sure, we may be long past designs like Sudden Pitfall, but I've still had any number of times that a single shadow card has ended what was otherwise a well-positioned game.  Especially in Saga, where a lost hero is basically a lost game, bad luck on a single shadow card can end it fast.

There may not be many ways to mitigate the bag yet (mostly Survivors) but while a lot of people seem to be comparing it to the mitigation options with LOTR, how many shadow cancels were there in the Core+Mirkwood?  I'd have to go back to check to be sure, but I'm pretty sure if you weren't running Spirit for Hasty Stroke or Lore for Burning Brand, you just ate whatever it threw at you.

Edit: Also worth noting that there are still plenty of Sudden Pitfall effects even outside of your attempts to mitigate them.  We just finished Wastes of Eriador...  Trying hitting a Predatory Wolves (or two) on setup in a 4-player game, or Lost in the Wilderness.  Pretty much game over on those single flips.  Whatever your view on the potential to fail a test is, I've never set up Arkham and said "Well, that was a good game.  Reshuffle and try again?" before I took even a single action.

Pretty sure Dawn Take You All (Leadership) was in the Mirkwood cycle... and maybe Rider of the Mark (spirit ally) and Dunedain Watcher (Leadership ally)? Don't have time to check.

Rider of the Mark was in the Dwarrowdelf cycle, but the other two were late in Mirkwood...  So we can see if we get at least two more ways to manipulate the bag by the end of the Dunwich cycle :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]  Honestly, I think if we really lay it out there are probably more ways to manipulate the bag results now than there were ways to mitigate shadow cards after Hunt for Gollum.  Wendy has it as a built-in, Lucky (as long as you don't hit the autofail), Oops, Will to Survive, Look What I Found...

I also think it is important to consider that depending on how you consider it, every card in the game has the ability to control the bag.  Every card you commit to a test makes you more likely to succeed, and many come with bonus effects.  I think this feels different to a lot of people because you have to make the decision before...  but is it any different than adding a maybe-unnecessary character to an attack in case the shadow increases defense, or blocking with a beefier character than is needed to block the printed attack value?

The more you play both LOTR and AH the more you realise how different they feel , even though they are both LCGs with a similar approach to deckbuilding and mechanics.

I agree that LOTR is more about one off scenario challenges with a definitive win position and ending. AH is much more staggered and i guess flowing, you may think you won and still get a condition from it, so nothing is as clear cut until the final showdown i guess. Personally i couldn't get my head around the AH way after being a long term player of LOTR, and i just didnt like taking counters out of a bag all the time as a mechanism so i dropped out. I prefer to play cards against cards to solve the quest.

The thrust of my initial post thoughts about loving LOTR potentially making it harder to like AH does ring true for a number of people it seems.

"Rats in the Walls" is one of my all time favorite Lovecraft stories.   Nevertheless, people don't want to play that game.  Nobody wants to play the game where you start out investigating something weird with your buds and your cat whose name is a racial slur, and ends with you cannibalizing one of your friends.     

People want to play the hero.   Lovecraft started getting 'gamified', when they started making lovecraft games.   I enjoy lovecraft's work as fiction, but good fiction doesn't always make for good board games. Point is,  if FFG (or whoever else) wants to sacrifice some elements of 'theme' for the sake of making a good game,  I am fine with that.  Not just fine with it,   I think it's their responsibility to do so if they want to have a good product.

I like LotR much more at the moment and I think that "my" reason wasn´t mentioned here. That reason is replayability. Always the same map and locations with very minor changes (random chose between 2 of nine locations doesn´t help). Arkham need much more and better work with locations in my oppinion. After first game you know what is where, where to go at what moment, what will happen in which act and agenda. You know quest cards in LotR as well but there is much more flexibility in encouter deck, that spawns enemies, treacheries AND locations that stand in your way. The narrative aspect for me is not so far ahead in the favor of Arkham as others say. LotR is great in that aspect as well. After playing LotR I want instantly more - no matter if I win or lose, I want to try that scenario one more time. In Arkham I go through the scenario and I win or lose but I don´t know if I was lucky or unhappy and the game "forces" me to play next scenario instantly.

But that´s my point of view and most people around me see Arkham as much better game so maybe it´s only my issue. 

Finally, we compare game with large portion of expansions and with much more experiences what is good or bad in that game. I will surely wait till the end of fist cycle but I´ pretty sure Arkham really needs improvements on the field of locations and greater flexibility. 

Sorry for language and possible mistakes, English is not my language...

I definitely agree that replay-ability is lower with Arkham atm.  I've played the core quests several times now, and I really have no interest in seeing them again.  But that can be said for the core quests of LotR as well.

I don't think Arkham forces you to play the next scenario any more than LotR Saga quests do.  If you want to replay a scenario in Arkham, there is nothing that prohibits you from doing this.  We also house rule that you can make changes to your deck between scenarios as we are still learning the card pool, what is good and what works.

 

Overall, they are different enough games you can't exactly compare them.  Both do different things very well and I enjoy them both for what they are.  

 

One of my frustrations with Arkham is playing games with different groups.  My different play groups are at different scenarios and naturally earn different values of XP, and so I have to constantly rebuild my decks with more/less XP.

Exactly.  The games should feel different, because the works from which they're derived are vastly different!  Hope is a central theme of Tolkien's works.  This is not "hope" in the sense of just wanting things to turn out ok for individuals, personally, but rather the knowledge that, as Sam realized, "in the end the Shadow was only a small and passing thing: there was light and high beauty for ever beyond its reach."

 

This is most definitely not the view held by Lovecraft, in his works.  Lovecraftian works are more about the incomprehensibility of the world and the utter insignificance of humanity in comparison.  Even in "victory", protagonists realize that all they've really done is just bought a bit more time...

This is a highly subjective thing.  For a lot of Lovecraftian fans, theme=fun. I think the same can be said for LOTR. With some exceptions, it is a well themed game, and that contributes to the enjoyment. It's not just about getting thrashed by generic types and numbers, it's about how well it brings those to life.

If you're not someone who enjoys dark endings then that's cool, but it doesn't make Arkham a worse game. Just the opposite, honestly. The fact that you don't like it tells me that they captured the theme very well. If someone was disappointed that LOTR wasn't just a fighting game of battles and killing, and what was all this questing silliness, what would you tell them? Same goes for Arkham.

Arkham is not LOTR.  It does a lot better than LOTR, and a few things worse, but a lot of it is just different. Much of this thread is starting to feel like "it's not LOTR so it's worse". Which is to be expected in here, I guess, i think there are far more interesting comparisons to be had.

You're not reading my posts.   I *do* like AH LCG.   I'm just saying that thematic  does not mean better.    You can't give a bad design element a free pass because "it's thematic."  Especially when it comes to Lovecraft.   Racism is thematic in Lovecraft.   That doesn't mean we should make it part of the game.

On the broader question, thematic elements most certainly contribute to the question whether something is good design or bad design.  No, theme doesn't justify everything, but it is a strong contributor to whether a design element is good or bad.  Is racism the core theme of the Lovecraftian universe?  Without bothering to get into the debate over Lovecraft himself, I doubt most people would say so.  So it doesn't need to be in this game.  Does that mean that racism as a theme never belongs in a game?  I think it would be hard to make, say, a game set in the Civil Rights Movement in Alabama without including racism as a thematic element.  It's core to the setting.  And the core of the Lovecraftian setting is that humanity never truly "wins".  It might survive, it might stave off the inevitable for a time, but we eventually lose and until then we emerge scarred.

That theme is core to the game.  You may not enjoy it, but (as I said) that's personal - it's not necessarily good or bad.  I happen to think it's good, but I'm someone who enjoys the horror movies where nobody makes it out.  You think it's bad, because you feel the need to "win" every scenario.  You said above that everyone wants to play the hero - that's not true.  You may want to always be the shining hero who's guaranteed to eventually emerge victorious, but that's not everyone.  I'd rather play Rats in the Walls (yes, complete with eventual descent into insanity) than a wish fulfillment fantasy like Harry Potter.

I like the Cthulhu Mythos, and I like LotR. I play both, and like, AH and LotR LCGs. But to me, while theme is nice, it's the last thing I think about when playing the game. I'm a huge mechanics focused player, I don't care about the story or theme when I play. I get down to the nitty gritty details of the game. Having said that, it's nice when theme and mechanics intertwine beautifully, but when the game is a slave to theme and bad or frustrating mechanics are introduced for the sake of being faithful to that theme (autofail token I'm looking at you.), that's when it impacts my enjoyment of the game. I'm here to play a game that is fun and engaging, theme be damned. Good news is they are fun games in their own right. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

I love the art and atmosphere of AHlcg, but I'm not sure what exactly the intended play experience is. I've been playing Dunwich Legacy with a solo investigator, and after doing well in one mission, have basically failed my way through the rest. It seems so unsatisfying to get halfway through Curse of the Rougarou, seeing all of the interesting things that *could* happen, and then just... die. The worst was the first mythos pack though - again, you go through all of the complicated setup, try to set the mood and get in the narrative zone, and then get killed about 1/3 of the way through the scenario.

With LotR, the focus is on the mechanics, so if you die you don't lose nearly as much momentum, and you can far more easily reshuffle and try again. It's akin to getting killed in a videogame, where you reload and try immediately. With Arkham, it feels more like you sit down for a 3 hour session of Call of Cthulhu RPG, and 20 minutes in the GM says "and you die. See you next week, and we'll pick up the story at a later point. I guess you'll never know what happened to the Rougarou etc." You feel that you've missed out on story content and it's very unsatisfying.
Now, I know people say you can just try again anyway - but with the different "resolutions" and all, it seems to me that that isn't the *intended experience*. So... what is the intended experience? It would be great if on your first playthrough, you just about make it "through" each scenario whilst suffering along the way. But more often than not, you die at a far less satisfying moment. It doesn't seem possible to have a compelling narrative when the random elements of the game might kill you.

There are other issues making this worse. A lot of the location effects (barriers etc) seem almost impossible to overcome depending on your investigator, and compared to LotR it frequently seems that there is just nothing you can do on your turn to avoid being killed. And I like the idea of exploring the locations, but when playing solo you can get really screwed because of the limited movements, and only realising in hindsight that you've wasted your precious actions by going to the wrong locations or pursuing the objective that is actually not best for your investigator.

I really, really wanted to like this. But the concept just doesn't seem to work, and compared to the freedom of LotR at this point it hardly seems like a game at all.

I've got several dozen campaigns under my belt, and I think I've died once, maybe twice. If you find yourself dying that frequently, perhaps you're misunderstanding some rule? Or try on Easy Mode (Story Mode) if you're less concerned about gameplay and more concerned about the RPG element.

The point of Arkham is not to "win" a scenario. It's to see what happens, and if you hit a situation where some location is impossible for your Investigator to enter, or an enemy impossible to kill, to look for alternative ways of finishing. Find another exit, VP farm and resign, look for another Objective. Each Investigator should not be able to accomplish the same ends. Rex isn't going to kill boss enemies, but can easily find clues and get other resolutions. Similarly, Zoey might find it tough to investigate the whereabouts of missing professors, but science experiments run amok, she can kill with exigent impunity. In reality would a librarian kill winged snakes? Or would an Irish gangster care to hunt down hidden artefacts? I guess the point is this game is an RPG. Find a character whose personality and traits speak to you, and see how they can accomplish their mission.

I do agree, though, that setup and takedown can be fiddly, and it's disheartening to lose a scenario after 5 minutes. But many of the LOTR scenarios are the same way. Mount Gram takes a good 10 minutes to set up, and you can be completely boned from the first turn. Three Trials is the same way. Steward's Fear.

Yea, I've played lots of games so far and have yet to completely die in a game, though some we've definitely finished with the least optimal resolution and with some deaths. Also worth noting, every game I play is 2-4 player.

That´s my main issue with AH - you know what will happen after first campaign and you know all resolutions after 3 attempts no matter what investigator you play. There´´ s nothing that can surprise you. Deckbuilding is great, the game is flavorful, I have no problem with most of mechanics including chaos bag or auto fail token but this LCG has much less replayability then LotR.

 

I think that you need two different Cellars, two different Graveyards and ALL other locations with completely different effects to not be sure what happens where. Then this game will be really fantastic.

Explain how Arkham has less replayability than LOTR. Once you strip away the resolutions, which you have, the only randomness comes from the encounter deck and the chaos bag and which location you choose to travel to. The only randomness in LOTR comes from.... oh right, the encounter deck, the shadow effects, and which location you choose to travel to. Why is one different than the other?

This is actually an interesting discussion in video games as well.  A lot of people don't like the "die and reload instantly" thing.  It leads to games like EVE Online, where investment and loss hurt.  Not saying EVE is a great game (I don't personally think it is) but the potential for loss adds weight to what you do, and that makes everything more intense.

I never loved the "just reset and go again" nature of LOTR.  Saga fixes it a little by adding the hero loss penalty, but in reality that's so harsh that the only change is that "retry until win" becomes "retry until win without losing any heroes".

The fact that your scenario results in AH stick for at least the course of a campaign makes decisions matter more.  You're not just going to drop Delve Too Deep on a whim, because while the XP is good the negative effects may carry long-term consequences.  For me, what you're saying you dislike is exactly why I love it - I love that our decisions matter, that what we do in a game will have long-term benefits or losses.  Last game we played we got greedy with XP, and ended up failing because of it.  Decisions matter, and that's a good thing.

To me, the replay ability in LotR is worse for the very reason that there is only 2 possible outcomes. You win, or you lose.  Once through the Quest cards the first time, there is nothing that will surprise you - though it still may catch you unprepared.  That's different.  In Arkham, I've played the expansion a few times now, starting with each quest as the "first" quest and each time I've had different scenario/combinations of the Act/Agenda happening to where each play-through, there were still fairly decent differences in the game.    But for me, I'd say your letting the games desire for you to continue the story interfere with how you want to play the game.  In LotR, you play until you win.  The quests - excluding Saga - are completely stand alone, and so you have no issue just repeating a question until RNG gives you the cards in the right order that you can win.  Just play Arkham that same way.  Don't feel rushed into moving on to the next quest if you got a resolution you didn't like.   But, that's just my suggestion to try to get the most out of it for you.

Yeah, just my feeling. Maybe that´s because encounter deck has more card types - it spawns enemies, treacheries AND locations so you can get more combinations in different games but still leaded the right way by quests and unique cards at the right time, so you play the game and you are inside the story at the same time. In AH you go to location where you exactly know what will happen there. I think that locations are really missed opportunity how to make this game fantastic and maybe better than anything else. Now I feel AH too schematic for me - you go through the planned route and deal with treacheries or enemies, nothing more... and enemies seems too generic for me, they have stats but a lot of them have no special text, they feel too similar for me, where in LotR you have much more text and abilities which is maybe another thing that drives me closer to Rings.

But I have to admit that many players around me find AH as improvement in comparison to LotR so that could be my issue, not the game´´´ s.

Thanks for reply - that´s right that repeating the quest / scenario is the way I play LotR and I play the same way in AH. I play a few times and then I say to myself (before the game): "this one is THE ONE game and after this point I will continue with every outcome I´´ ll get and with the chosen resolution. It works fine for me and you hit it in your last sentence. I really won´t come through all scenarios of one cycle during one week...

> Yeah, just my feeling. Maybe that´s because encounter deck has more card types - it spawns enemies, treacheries AND locations so you can get more combinations in different games but still leaded the right way by quests and unique cards at the right time, so you play the game and you are inside the story at the same time. In AH you go to location where you exactly know what will happen there. I think that locations are really missed opportunity how to make this game fantastic and maybe better than anything else. Now I feel AH too schematic for me - you go through the planned route and deal with treacheries or enemies, nothing more... and enemies seems too generic for me, they have stats but a lot of them have no special text, they feel too similar for me, where in LotR you have much more text and abilities which is maybe another thing that drives me closer to Rings.

I think the location mechanic is much improved over LOTR. There, you just have these generic locations taking up staging area space, providing threat, that can lock you out of progress. In Arkham, you physically move your card to different locations, and since you're playing as an individual, you can really feel the story that you are in that location, and your buddy's across town, and enemies are in the building next door. As opposed to this amorphous feeling of location in LOTR.

I really do think it is just a matter of perceptions. Did you only play the first scenario? The enemies in that are a bit lackluster except for the boss, but overall, Arkham enemies have a ton of gametext...

Not only first scenario, but I didn´t play expansions, I played only core set. The unigue enemies from Midnight Mask are great (that´s best scenario out of the core set for me), but all the ghouls and small cultists... Really don´t know.

One important thing for me - this is just a core set and I compare LotR which has great history and really deep cardpool with many quests and ideas with just now starting game. Comparing both core sets will be much more fair for AH. Of course I´ ll try whole first cycle and I supposse I will see the direction and possible improvements (from my point of view, of course) in game design. I strongly believe that I will "catch" later cause I like the theme (much more than LotR).

Network57 Ad Locations - you still have usually 2-4 unique locations which comes in the right order and in the right time to drive the story. 

But you´re right about the move through Arkham - once I evaded hunter enemy I wasn´t able to deal with ad I moved through the city from one location to another while the enemy pursued me and I tried to take a clue here or there during the run - that was great moment. Different approach and works for me sometimes as well as for you.

Personally, I've never liked locations in LOTR.  It goes to our previous discussions on theme - they're a solid enough mechanic, but theme-wise they never made sense to me.  Why is that abandoned cave threatening to me?  Handling different locations makes the whole thing feel thematically muddled - I'm zig-zagging all over this area, going back and forth to places I've already been, because...  why?  And there's rarely any association with the actual enemies that you're dealing with.  Locations are there to balance questing vs. combat, giving encounter cards which will interfere with questing just as enemies do with combat.

Some scenarios do manage it differently/better but it's always special rules for those, which points pretty strongly to them being a weakness in the base design.

I can definitely agree that they do increase variety in what you can expect from the encounter deck, but at least for me I don't really consider that the same as replayability.  Past a few runs you know what's there, you know what to expect/worry about, you plan for it, and the cards either turn or they don't.  Arkham is the same, even in cases where there is extra randomness.  The multiple options for locations in Midnight Masks or multiple Woods in Devourer Below do make you approach it a bit differently, but rarely does it change the game up enough for me to say "That was a completely different experience, I can play it again and be surprised!"  Just like with the encounter deck, you know what the possibilities are, and you plan accordingly.

I agree on most things and understand your oppinion. I have a bit different , but that´s OK, I think. But if you speak about Midnight Mask´ s locations and Woods , imagine if every Arkham location had two versions! Much more fun, much more possibilities and then it would be different experiences. But I understand the point of other posters. Thanks for the discussion and oppinions to all!

Well, no, that's kind of my point.  At least for me, the differences in the locations we have don't really have a meaningful impact on the game.  At least not enough to seriously impact replayability.  At least that's how I approach it.  It's not "On this playthrough I have to investigate with Fight, that's different!"  For me, it's "We don't know which skill we'll need to investigate here, so let's send Jenny exploring first because she can handle anything."  The resulting location doesn't give a different experience, because we have to plan for it regardless.

And that's honestly a good thing - the variations add a little flavor, but anything with differences large enough to seriously impact replayability would make the whole thing far more random.
