I haven't gotten a chance to post this yet here, but I posted up a short interview with Caleb Grace on Tales from the Cards this week.

btw Raven, I like the new update on the new player buying guide. It's almost too helpfull. :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] 

 

I LOVE anything about quests so if you could do some more stuff concerning quests and encounter decks that would be awesome. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

Great website,

Khamul

Thanks Khamul! So far, I have a continuing series of Encounter Card Set Reviews, and there will probably be more in-depth exploration of specific quests in the near future.

Sounds funny. Is sow how people dont understand and underestimate  many thinks in a life as usual. 

 

Interview with Designer mostly is ignored here. But is the best way to see how the designers thinking and understand how the game going and what happen. No most of the players prefer talking about tokens and they colour. A bit shame about it.

Personally I think the resource tokens should have been a shinier silver.  That would have made them stand out against the card borders.

personally i like this forum, far better than bgg- its more relaxed and everyone knows each other...where its ok to want different coloured tokens :blink: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_blink.png] bgg seems to have a high number of people who have no interest in tolkien at all, little lore or anything.....and whenever i have looked its full of threads of people complaining about the game

PS- just looked at the bgg thread of this for interest and theres NO replies there...!!! guess everyone is too busy complaining about the tokens on there also

I feel like I'm missing something...the color of tokens?!

yeah, i didn't get it when he and glaurung made it either. haha!

I don't think anyone's actually complaining about the color of tokens, he was just suggesting that people are more concerned with surface type things than they are about strategy or design choices.  I don't think that's the case, I am just interpreting Glaurung-speak :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

It's become an art form in it's own right :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

> its more relaxed and everyone knows each other...

Wow.  That's kinda.......creepy.  Personally, I sure don't want this forum to be anything more than asking questions and giving posting information about cards or something about the game.  I don't like how this new forum is more like a chat thing.  

 

But anyways thats just me. Oh and nothing against you Rich.  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

## 15 [richsabre on July 25, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86792-interview-with-caleb-grace/?do=findComment&comment=821613)

well...the world takes all sorts i guess. i have made some pretty good friends from here, and with my health i dont get to talk to many people, so its my main 'output' if you like (which you may have guessed... :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png])

 

so yeah...no creepyness intended, forums are afterall meant to be an annonymous environment, which i think they should be unless you want it to be different
