Title says it all. We played a game on Lackey and recorded it and wanted to share it. We were all using cards we actually own (I'm all in- own everything!), but weren't sure if that might violate the rules here.

Good to see some new videos specially with a 3 players but……… PTM is so boring…….cannot wait when you come to something more interesting as some Nmode quest. we have already so many videos about core set quiets and first cycle so i suggest you to play some new quests better. Anyway is up to you guys! cool video i enjoy anyway. Keep to on and welcome to the club!

I know PTM has been played to death BUT we're a mix of skill levels and decided to start from the beginning :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
