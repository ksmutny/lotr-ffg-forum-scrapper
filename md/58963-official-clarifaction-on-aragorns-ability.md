# [Official Clarifaction on Aragorn&#039;s ability](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58963-official-clarifaction-on-aragorns-ability/)

This has been bothering me for a while and I have found no mention of this anywhere.

Response: After Aragorn commits to a quest, spend 1 resource from his resource pool to ready him.

 

How many times can a player ready Aragorn in one turn/round? My group plays it like as long as Aragorn commits to the quest he can ready himself as many times as he has resources to do so. However the FAQ states

"(1.08) Responses per Trigger
If a response or forced response is triggered, the effect
can only occur once per trigger.
Example: Theodred (CORE 2) reads, "Response: After
Theodred commits to a quest...." This effect can only be
triggered once each time Theodred commits to a quest."

 

To me this sounds like Aragorn can only use that response once.

commiting to a quest happens only once per round anyways, so

1.quest phase- commit characters

2.commit aragorn

3.spend 1 resource to ready him

he cannot ready say in the attack phase just because he commited to a quest previously, and likewise he cannot re-commit to the quest t ogive him double willpower

So your group is playing it that if Aragorn commits to a quest, and later on needs to stand up again during a later phase, he can do it if he spends a resource? No, that's not right. His ability is a response, thus it can can only respond to committing to a quest. If his ability was a player action, and said something like "If Aragorn has committed to a quest this round..." then it could work that way. Written as it is, you are correct that it only works to stand him up after questing.

Thank you guys. My group won't be happy to know this is how it actually works but I can sleep better with a clean conscience.

Never really was a fan of him so this makes it so much easier to justify not using him.

Seems like you've answered your own question. As richsabre pointed out, Aragorn's response can only be triggered immediately after he commits to a quest (which only happens once per round, during the quest phase). Given that, and the fact that responses can only be triggered once per trigger, Aragorn's response can only be used once, and only after he commits to a quest.

Also, as alpha5099 noted, responses are different from Action: abilities. Responses can only be played immediately after their specified trigger occurs. In later phases of the turn, there will be no opportunity for Aragorn to commit to a quest, so his response trigger cannot happen.

In short: once, and only right after he commits to the quest.

Can I just get some clarification here? Because reading this thread has now really confused me on what I thought was a pretty straightforward rule! preocupado.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/preocupado.gif]

If Aragorn commits to a quest, you can use his ability to then ready him for use later on, by paying one of his resources, right? But do you still count the willpower he committed to that quest, or not?

I've been playing it that way, seeing his ability as basically a way to get two uses out of the same hero - questing and attacking/defending, something that is otherwise pretty difficult to get through the use of other cards. Hence why the ability makes Aragorn so handy, hence his high starting threat value.

But since reading this thread I get the impression that his willpower won't be counted on the quest, which basically makes him a high-cost hero for no benefit at all (save, say, getting dual-spehere from that stone thingy, maybe). Surely this cannot be right, as otherwise, why did FFG waste the ink printing what is basically a pointless ability? If you don't want to commit Aragorn to this quest because you may need him later on, just don't commit him - why go through the charade of committing him, then using his resources to stand him again for absolutely no benefit?

So, um, any help will be greatly received! gran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif]

You still get to count his Will for the Quest.

 

My question was about the number of times you could untap him after you commit him to the quest. My group was readying him 3- 6 times a turn.

I think you guys are all missing an important point.  Whether or not you can ready multiple times has no relevance.  A single character is either committed to a quest or they are not.  It's a binary status.  A single character can't ever  commit to a quest twice, regardless of what whacky powers you might have.

We never committed him to the quest more than once in any given turn. We didn't treat the response like it is intended. We would Commit Aragorn to the quest. Then Ready him with his ability. From there the justification was since he quested this turn he was able to ready himself as many times as he had resources.

Aragorn is very misunderstood I think...

 

The ability triggers it AT THE VERY MOMENT you commit to the quest. Many people seam to get this wrong. You have to pay and ready, before you reveal anything form the encounter deck. You can not pay and ready during any other phase in the game.. only at the VERY INSTANT you tap him to commit to the quest.

Also quest responses happen all at the same time PER PLAYER. When a player commits to a quest and has more than one quest response, they can just choose what order to do it in. So for example, a common combo is Theodred and Aragorn, using the resource from theodred on Aragorn effectively making not tap to quest. This ONLY works if Aragorn and Theodred are on the same players team, or if the player with Theodred turn is before the aragon player, because turn order requires one player to quest, then the next, then the next. If Theodred is on the same team as Arragon the player simply picks Theodred's response to go first, placing the resource on Aragorn, who then triggers his response. BUT, if they are on different teams, and the player with Theodred is after the player with Arragorn in the turn order, then when Aragorn went to quest he didn't have a resource and couldn't untap by spending it. Then the next player turn to quest, Theodred can place teh resource on aragorn.. but it is TO LATE for aragorn to trigger that response.

Aragorn's ability is a bit tricky, it looks very strait forward but it has a few weird rules associated with it.

I think this NOT works, if the player with Theodred turn is before the Aragon player, because Response of Theodred is:

"Response: After Théodred commits to a quest, choose a hero committed to that quest. Add 1 resource to that hero's resource pool."

 

When Theodred response is activated by first player, Aragorn is not a hero committed to that same quest yet (Aragorn is a card of second player).

So Aragorn don't gets 1 resource from Theodred.

You are correct, LEO987. I suspect that there must be more recent threads out there that confirm the same.
