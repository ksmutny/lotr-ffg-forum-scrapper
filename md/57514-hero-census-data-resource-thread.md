Hi Everybody,

Can you help me with my LOTR census data? For the purpose of creating various theme decks, I thought it would be fun to have a consolidated organized listing of heroes by various traits. Please feel free to help me out with this project if I’ve gotten confused about any of the data or if you have more ideas for groupings or thematic combos. And as long as there’s interest, I can keep this post updated as we receive more heroes over time.

 You could also group by sphere, threat cost, willpower, attack strength, defense strength, and hit points. Beyond that, you could group by the primary benefits the cards grant: card advantage (Beravor, Bilbo), action advantage (Aragorn, Boromir, Brand, Imrahil), resource advantage (Gloin, Theodred), self-boost (Eowyn, Gimli), and whatever category or categories you wish to invent to group the various healing, attack cancellation, progress manipulation, and other abilities the remaining heroes introduce.

Great ideas Thorongil. I'll work on these soon and add them to the post. I'll probably organize these categories under the two larger headings of Stats and Abilities, or something like that. Good stuff!

Also, I was thinking it might be fun to add a section of fun hero combo theme ideas (e.g. the 3 Hunters - Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli). It would be fun to hear what other thematic combos people have run with their decks and list them all in one place.

Okay... Sphere of Influence and Card Stats sections complete.

Will work on Game Text and Set Information sections soon.

In the mean time, feel free to post any ideas for Thematic Hero Combinations (as somehow tied to the story).
