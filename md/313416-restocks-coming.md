I've been out of pocket on the game for awhile, but I've thought about coming back and filling out my collection.  I'm going to have to assemble the missing decks I have piecemeal, but I can tell a few of them are out of stock about everywhere with pretty inflated secondary pricing.  Last I heard, the game was on hiatus in terms of new material, but do we know the intentions to produce more of the old chapters and expansions?  I'm just trying to configure my expectations about the pieces I'm missing in the game.

 

Thanks.

I doubt that anyone other than FFG/Asmodee really knows. To my knowledge, no official info about the status of future reprints has been made public.
