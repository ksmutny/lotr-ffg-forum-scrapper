1) For the Halbarad hero from The Lost Realm: If I optionally engage two enemies with Halbarad's effect and both of them have higher engagement cost than my threat, does Sam Gamgee get the +1 boost to all his stats twice, even though he only readies once? (Assuming you don't use an effect that causes him to exhaust in between engaging the first and second enemy.)

 

2) For the Halbarad ally from Flame of the West: If I engage an enemy with engagement cost that is 5 lower than my threat, does Sam Gamgee's effect still trigger given that Halbarad increases the engagement cost of all enemies engaged with you by 10, thus putting the engagement cost of the enemy you just engaged at 5 higher than your threat? Or does Halbarad's effect only start applying after the window in which Sam Gamgee's effect can be triggered has already closed?

 

Thanks for any insights!

1. Yes, Sam gets stat bonus twice

2. Yes, the enemy is engaged when Sam's response is activated.

Sam hero is such a good hero. I'm suprised not to see him more oftent comboed in a Dunedain deck...

For detail:

1.Sam doesn't have a limit. It can trigger as much as it can, and the two abilities are independant.

2.Sam triggers after the engagement, at which point the enmy is already engaged so Halb applies.

I have used Sam and Halbarad together before! I posted about the deck [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/193168-look-to-the-west/] here on the forums, but it looks like it was in the before-times when RingsDB wasn't a thing yet. I should probably pull it in and update it, actually, I remember it being really fun.
