Hey i play this game so long time but just now realize about cancel when revealed effect on the quest cards.

So if you can cancel when revealed effect on the quest card is mean many things changed for me and game is going to be hell of a lot easy.

Osgiliath for example: Cancel when revealed effect and there i no Witch-King on the last stage.Ups!!!

Into the pit : Cancel when revealed effect on the second quest card and there is no Orcs coming  and you can switch sometimes automatic to last stage if there is no enemies in play. For 4 players game this is joke. Instead get 4 orcs and one of them is Patrol Leader you just get nothing and if there is no enemies you go to next stage. UPS!!!!!! Wow to stupid!

Anduin: No ambush on the last stage.

I think this is really stupid!!!! Cose if you can get rid of Witch-King just by the holding 1card in hand (Test of will) is destroy whole  idea of the Osgiliath quest.

What you think Fellows?
