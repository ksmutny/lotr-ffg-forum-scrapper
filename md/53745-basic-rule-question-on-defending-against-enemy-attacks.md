 I'm pretty sure I understand this one correctly, but I want to confirm.  Without modification provided by some event card, attachment, or other game card text, only one character can be declared as a defender against an enemy that is attacking.  Is that correct?  I've seen in some posts that seem independent of discussions about "Stand Together" some reference to multiple characters defending against a single attacker.  I think I am just misunderstanding those posts because the rule pretty clearly states: "Only one character can be declared as a defender against each attacking enemy."

I can't believe I'm asking the question... it seems so obvious.

Correct, without modification, it must be one defender against one attacker.
