Hmm this one boggles the mind a bit. The card says:

Action: Exhaust Support of the Eagles to choose an Eagle ally. Until the end of the phase, attached hero adds that ally´s attack or defense (choose 1) to it´s own

Take this card at face value and it would mean that no build-in game mechanic (excluding other cards for this example), would be able to prevent this effect from taking place. But the following questions still keep gnawing at the back of my mind:

1) Can an exhausted eagle still give it´s bonus? (I´d say that based on the wording it doesn´t matter wether the eagle is exhausted or not)

2) If an eagle dies before the end of the phase (shadow card or planned suicide defense) does it still give it´s bonus or does the bonus stop the moment the eagle dies?

Especially the 2nd question has me puzzled. Because the rules state that once a card is taken out of the game, it can no longer affect play or be affected (unless a card specifically says it affects a card outside play). However the eagle has already bestowed it´s bonus and it could thus be reasoned that it isn´t affecting the game anymore but it is indeed "support of the eagles" which is the affecting card. The fact that it just happens to be a now dead eagle that is used for calculations, until the end of the phase, is thus irrelevant.

Any and all thoughts are welcome

Yes, the card doe not say that as part of the cost you need to exhaust the other eagle. So imo, yes.. you can play this on any eagle exhausted or not.

No. Again, you pay the cost and get the result... your not attaching, there is nothing "linking" these cards. So, IMO, no..

 

And answer to your next question? YES this card is frickn powerful as ****

1) As Boored said the state of the Eagle does not matter. Ready, exhausted makes no difference you are just looking at its defence or attack value.

2) SoE adds the attack or defence of the eagle at the time it is exhausted. Whatever happens to the eagle after that is irrelevant. So if you exhaust SoE to add winged guardians defence to a hero then use winged guardian to defend and disguard him because you couldn't pay the resource to keep him the hero still gets his defence bonus until the end of the round.

The card is quite powerful but it takes a bit to get it running. This card is insane with Eagles of the Misty Mountains. I had two of the SoE on Boromir and a boosted EoMM in play. Boromir was swinging for 19 attack. The Eagle deck is definitely a viable option for those enemy heavy quests.

Thanks for the answers. This was indeed how I read it myself, but couldn´t quite get my head around the awesomness of it

Q:- Dose this card take +ATK or +DEF from attachments as well?

Like the card dose not say "printed" cost... so I am thinking that if you have a modifier on your card to add additional + to your eagles attack or defense that is counted during the transfer... ?

I would think so. I have certainly played it that way. Eagles of the Misty Mountains, a couple of facedown attachments, add that to a hero and you have an instant tank. And if you can refresh that hero, then, you can hit more than one enemy with it. And I agree, this is one powerful card.
