# [Nazgul ability in Escape from Dol Guldur](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/51276-nazgul-ability-in-escape-from-dol-guldur/)

## 1 [radiskull on August 10, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/51276-nazgul-ability-in-escape-from-dol-guldur/?do=findComment&comment=512067)

 We were playing the third quest from the Core set and ran into a situation not adequately covered by the rules:

 

The Nazgul attacked, and it has the ability that when a shadow card effect on it resolves, the defending player must choose and discard one character from play.  So the combat went as follows:

1. Nazgul attacks.

2. Gandalf defends.

3. Shadow card effect resolves, I choose to discard Gandalf.

 

The question is what happens next?  Does the attack become "No Defenders"?  If so, would the shadow card's effect possibly change retroactively?  This didn't seem correct to us, so we determined that since Gandalf was declared as a defender, the attack was defended, and thus all of the Nazgul's damage went to Gandalf, even though he was in the discard pile.  I'm not entirely satisfied with our resolution of that combat, though.

The combat sequence is resolved as follows:

1. Shadow card is dealed face down to all enemies that are engaged

2. Enemy attacks

3. Player choses/declares defender

4. Shadow card is revealed and resolved

5. Damage is calculated (Attack value vs. Shield)

If for any reason the defender is removed before step 5, the attack counts as undefended. So in your case the Nazgul would remove its own defender and strike as undefended...

 Ok, that makes sense.  The shadow card's effect wouldn't change retroactively because it's already been resolved.  And now that I look again, I see that it's explicity stated so on page 18.

 

Follow up question:  What if, after step 4 (in your list), another player snuck in a Son of Arnor and engaged the Nazgul?  I understand that at this point it would be too late to declare a new defender, so the attack would be undefended.  But which player's hero takes the damage?  The rulebook states that it's the "active player" who takes this damage, so I suppose it would have to be the player who is currently resolving attacks against them, i.e., the original player.

I don't think that the Nazgul's attack is valid anymore.  The Nazgul is no longer engaged with you, and therefore can't attack you.  It will start a new attack against the player that engaged it with Son of Arnor, but only when its that player's turn to resolve enemy attacks.  I could be wrong about this though.  I haven't thought about that kind of situation.  However, if you are sneaking a Son of Arnor during combat, it's usually best done before a defender is declared, and a little late if you do it after the shadow card resolves.

 The Nazgul DID attack me, though, and its attack is in the process of resolving.  I agree that it will attack the Arnor player when it is that player's turn as well, but there's nothing in the rules to suggest that an attack will (or even CAN) be aborted in this way.  It would be cool if it did, because it's a cheap way to save a player who's about to get pounded, but it does feel kind of...cheap.

 

I know that Son of Arnor is usually best played before defenders are declared (although if they can cause an attack to simply fizzle, this may become "best"); I was simply wondering who would take the undefended damage:

a) The original player

b) The Arnor player

c) no one.

The enemy only attacks after the defending player decides not to play any actions, then from the moment the enemy attacks untill the moment when the damage is calculated and assigned no player can play/use any actions (only responses). Therefore you cant sneak an sneak attack into the combat sequence as mentioned above (pun intended). The last eligible moment to play a sneaked son of Arnor is prior the attack of an enemy (the same for Dark Knowledge, Henemarth Riversong or healing abilities etc.) If played so resolve steps 2-5 normally but only with the Player who played Son of Arnor as the defending player. After the damage has been assigned you can play actions again until you decide not to and the next enemy who is engages attacks...

This is false.  From the rulebook, page 18:

 

"When resolving enemy attacks, the players follow these 4 steps, in order. Players may play event cards and take actions at the end of each step."

I second Radiskull. I don't know what to answer to the question (what happen in combat when the enemy change engaged player after starting to resolve his attack, but before it's completed), but you certainly have the chance to play actions between revealing the Shadow card (part of the "attack" sequence and resolving damage.

I would think in that particular case where the attack had already been declared and then Arnor came into play (Sneak Attack?), it would cancel out the attack and just re-engage the enemy over to the Arnor player. No further attack from that enemy would occur until next round.

Think of it as an awkward Feint.

May end up seeing some errata about this to keep Arnor's ability from working in the middle of the combat steps.

I was thinking c) no one.  I would play it as though Son of Arnor causes the attack to fizzle.  If you time it right, it could even stall the attack from the Nazgul for one more round, but that's only if the person sneaking the Son of Arnor has already resolved all the attacks from enemies engaged with them before they force the Nazgul to engage them.  I do base that solely on the assumption that enemies only attack and damage the player they are engaged with, and we might get clarification in a future FAQ.

the question i would have is, did the person sneak attacking the son of arnor already resolve the attacks by enemies engaged with him?

each player starting with the first player resolves all attacks against him then you proceed to the next player. so if he had already resolved all attacks against him the nuzgul was forced to engage the owner of the son of arnor to no effect, if the owner of son of arnor had not resolved his attacks the nuzgul attacks him.

In this particular case, the Nazgul was attacking the first player, and the Son of Arnor was played by the second player. We all agreed that, regardless of how the attack against the first player turned out, the second player would be attacked my the Nazgul regardless.

I think that in an ideal situation (and this "scenario" is true and it plays right) would be:

1) The first player (player 1) defends (he hasn't the Nazgul engaged).

2) Turn for player 2 to defend himself. First he deals 1 card for the Nazgul (let's say, it is the only enemy card engaged with the second player), then he declares who attacks (obviously, the Nazgul), then he declares defender. Then reveals the Shadow effect and finally combat/damage recount.

3) Between these 5 sub-phases (deal a shadow card to combat/damage recount) ALL players can play actions (this is right, it is in the rules as it was stated before by radiskull).

4) In this case, AFTER the 3rd sub-phase (declare defenders) and BEFORE the 4th (reveal and apply Shadow Effects). Player 1 (the one who defended already) could play Sneak Attack + Son of Arnor, making the Nazgul engage him.

5) After that, player 2 can breathe. No attacks were made to him. And this also goes to player 1, which defended before. So the Nazgul this turn hasn't made any mischief to anyone.

 

In the case that player 1 were the Nazgul defender and player 2 the one who can play Sneak Attack + Son of Arnor, then he can do it, of course. But when player 1 ends his defense, it will be player 2 problem to resolve Nazgul attacks.

 Jekzer, we are still not certain if your step 5 works as you say.  If it does, then yeah, that's the best situation possible, as you get a round free from attack.  But I am still not convinced that changing who the Nazgul is engaged with mid-attack changes who the defending player is, and whether someone takes damage from an undefended attack.

Well let's see if I can help a bit more, because this issue has been discussed in many forums (BGG for instance) and I was pretty sure that the "great idea" of Son of Arnor was that, and wasn't ambiguous.

Page 18 from the Rule Book, phase 6 -> Combat:  "When resolving enemy attacks, the players follow these 4 steps, in order. Players may play event cards and take actions at the end of each step."

So then, you can play Sneak Attack + Son of Arnor from your hand between steps. Son of Arnor has a Response, which is activated the moment he enters play (i.e. from an event like Sneak Attack). It reads "After Son of Arnor enters play, choose an enemy card in the staging area or currently engaged with another player. Engage that enemy."

Then again, Nazgul is engaged with the other player. You (the player who comboes Sneak Attack + Son of Arnor) can "break" his engagement and make the card yours. When you do that, the Nazgul is NOT attacking, because is not your turn, but the second player's turn, and the Nazgul NOW is not engaged with him. And you did that BEFORE the revealing of the Shadow Effect and BEFORE combat/damage recount. So no calculations were made and the shadow card is discarded.

When the second player finishes the combat phase, we pass to the next player's combat phase. If there are no more players (that means, ALL the player did his combat phase, and in our example the player that did the combo was the first in doing that, so player 1 and 2 have made it), they proceed no the next phase (Refreshment). And Son of Arnor returns before the new phase starts to the owner's hand (Sneak Attack).

I hope that my "slow" description was of more help :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png].

Yeah, that description is clear :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]  I completely agree that all of the card plays are legal.  My complaint is that the rulebook isn't clear on what happens to an attack declared against a player that is no longer engaged with the attacking enemy after the attack has already begun.  I am very hopeful that we'll get an official response to this soon.

## 18 [lleimmoen on August 12, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/51276-nazgul-ability-in-escape-from-dol-guldur/?do=findComment&comment=513496)

Wow, and I thought I had Son of Arnor covered, as it is one of my favourite cards.

Just to make the card more obviously awesome for others, too, I would add that not only Sneak Attack is the great combo but also Stand and Fight. They work just the same for the effect in that particular phase, the difference: Stand and Fight costs 3 Spirit tokens instead of 1 Leadership; but Son of Arnor stays instead of going back to hand.

Back to the point. So, you are the first player, the other player has Nazgul engaged, in that case you can just Sneak (or Stand) Son in after the attacks against you were made. Vice versa, you are not the first player, the other player has Nazgul engaged, if you then interupt the fighting sequence, the attack has no bearing (beside perhaps playing some event cards affecting it, like Swift Strike) but then you get Nazgul and have to deal with it. Is this the consensus?

 I think we have a consensus on every point EXCEPT "...if you then interupt the fighting sequence, the attack has no bearing..."  I'm not at all convinced that this is correct, although it is definitely one of three possible outcomes.  If you move Nazgul to the first player after attacks against player 1 are done, you skip an attack.  If you move Nazgul from player 1 to player 2, player 2 has to deal with it.  If you move him mid-attack, we have no idea what to do.

Yep, hopefully this will get a FAQ entry at some point, as its not clear what happens if a enemies condition changes during the 4 steps of an attack - does the attack resolve regardless of any changes, or are they immediately cancelled if the conditions change.

On a related note, what if the active player plays quick strike and manages to kill the Nazgul mid-attack? Does the Nazgul's attack still resolve, probably not, which means the Nazgul's attack probably does fizzle if SoA is played.

But the rules aren't clear on this IMO.

## 21 [radiskull on August 12, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/51276-nazgul-ability-in-escape-from-dol-guldur/?do=findComment&comment=513611)

 I think it's clear that if something kills the Nazgul before the damage step, then no damage is dealt.  This has nothing to do with SoA's ability, though; there is simply no attacker in play to deal the damage.  With the SoA situation, there is still an attacker in play whose combat has not yet had a chance to complete.


I don't think the two situations are necessarily comparable.

But what Quick Strike shows is that it is possible within the game to legally break the cycle of the 4 steps, likewise there is nothing in any rules or cards to suggest the damage is applied to the player of SoA, so there are only really two options, no damage is dealt because the cycle of the 4 steps is broken by SoA intervention or the 4 steps complete regardless and damage is still dealt to the active player.

It's probably the first option, which makes practical sense IMO, but you are right, its not clear.

I would side with this. But I have been wrong before.

One thing surely, if you kill an enemy with Quick Strike, it deals no damage. This is a good point, the chain is interuptable.

On a side note (sort of), one can really just play Sneak (or S&F) on SoA after his enemies' attacks are resolved, if the enemy that SoA is pulling has not attacked yet. I mean there is practicaly little reason to wait and interupt the sequence, with exceptions like Gondorian Spearman, Swift Strike, etc. So there might be a reason and this whole paragraph is rubish, really. Sorry.

 Well, I went straight to the source, and here's what Nate French said (important part bolded by me):

"There are 4 steps to enemy attack resolution, and event cards/ actions can be played at the end of each step (p. 18 core rulebook):

1. Choose an enemy.

2. Declare defender.

3. Resolve shadow effect.

4. Determine combat damage.

In your example, Sneak Attack/ Son of Arnor would have to be played after step 3. Damage will then be determined against the new player with whom the Nazgul is engaged.

(Once step 4 begins, there is no opportunity to play an action until it has resolved.)

So it looks like player 2's plan to rescue player 1 will go rather badly for him.  Thanks to FFG and to Nate specifically for the clarification!

Woah, so you've asked Mr. French :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]. Thanks radiskul !

Althought this raised more doubts for me :S... The new player didn't declare attackers and defenders (because the Nazgul movement). So all the damage needs to go to a hero? And what if the player already defended? Does a creature from the "encounter player" attack twice to a player? 2 combat phases in a row? Doesn't this contradict the rules, when an engaged creature attacks one time to a player in Combat phase?

And if you play the combo before the reveal of the shadow effect, you move the shadow card with the Nazgul to the new engaged player and then you reveal it?

 

## 26 [radiskull on August 13, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/51276-nazgul-ability-in-escape-from-dol-guldur/?do=findComment&comment=513889)

Player 2 did not declare defenders (he couldn't), so yes, one of player 2's heroes will take all the damage.

If player 1 already defended, I think that player 2 engaging the Nazgul would be a bad idea, but I would extrapolate that instead of being defended by player 1, it becomes undefended by player 2.

Once player 1's enemies finish attacking him, player 2's enemies will attack him, including the Nazgul (again) in this case.  There aren't two combat phases in a row, the first Nazgul attack came during the part of the combat phase where enemies attack player 1.  The rules state that you repeat the combat steps "for each enemy that [you are] engaged with."  Thus, it doesn't matter that the Nazgul already attacked player 1.  It is engaging player 2 during the time when enemies attack player 2, thus it attacks.

Finally, shadow cards attach to an enemy, so if the enemy moves after step 2, so does its shadow card, which will then be revealed in step 3.

 

Presumably, if you moved the Nazgul after step 1, the second player would then have the opportunity to declare one of HIS defenders, since it moved before the "Declare Defenders" step.

 

P.S.  I'm using male pronouns because that's what the game does.  I in no way want to disparage any female gamers.  What I wouldn't give for English to have a non-awkward, gender-neutral, singular personal pronoun.  Sigh...

Interesting. Thanks for sharing.

In the practical use now, it makes little difference. You just need to get SoA in play before the attacks starts. You do your defending, then ****** the enemy from the player who were about to do his. I have always played it thus.

It is interesting, and strange that the combo has a significantly different effect depending when it is played in the round. It almost throws some question marks around the validity of using SoA before the attack starts, does that really mean the Nazgul misses an attack that round?  From the rules though that seems clear how that should be played and is now the only sensible way to play SoA and Sneak attack.

Based on the rules though i would never have surmised the damage was dealt to the player who played SoA....

So, to sum up: let's say that player 1 already defended successfully all the attacks from his engaged monsters. So he finishes his "defense sub-phase". We move to player 2 (he has the nasty Nazgul engaged and is the only one). Player 1 decides to play the combo Sneak Attack + SoA after dealing the shadow card. Then player 2 ends his defense phase (no engagements now). And now we return to player 1, because he has a new engaged enemy (even if he already passed successfully his defense sub-phase)? I assume that he can declare defenders in this case (he engaged the Nazgul before the defense declaracion), as you said, radiskull.

It sounds a bit strange, but well, I'll get used to it :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png], if that's the way it's meant to be played :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] .

This is the best summarization of the issues I can come up with:

 Sneak Attack + SoA could easily be used to force the Nazgul to skip an attack, as long as it is used before the Nazgul is chosen to attack (step 1).  Here's the framework as I see it, with ** explaining what happens if SA + SoA is played at that particular time.  I'm assuming that Nazgul is attacking the Player A, and Player B is playing the card combo.

 

**If played here, Nazgul will not attack Player A, and may possibly force the Nazgul to skip its attack this round if player B has already resolved attacks against him.

1) Nazgul is chosen to attack Player A.

**If played here, Nazgul will shift its attack to Player B, enabling Player B to declare defenders during step 2.

2) Defenders are chosen.

**If played here, it will mean that the attack will be undefended against Player B, unless someone used a Sentinel character to defend.  It also means that player B will bear the brunt of any shadow cards referring to the "defending player".  The defender that Player A chose, if any, will do nothing in this attack unless it a) has Sentinel or b) has a Response pertaining to when it is declared as a defender.

3) Shadow effects are resolved.

**If played here, player A will be affected by the shadow card (and thanks to the Nazgul effect, player A will need to discard a character).  Player B will take the undefended damage.

4) Damage is resolved.

**If played here, there is not a big effect.

 

In any event, if player B uses the combo at any time during player A's defense phase, and player B has yet to resolve attacks against him, then the Nazgul will attack player B during B's defense phase also, albeit without a shadow card.

Nicely explained. Let's see if FFG decides to put this ambiguity solved in the FAQ, it will come handy to other players that don't read forums :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] .

A very accurate but pretty convoluted process, especially the attacking a second time without a shadow card as you state above - seems unneccessarily complex for not a great deal of gain.

If I were FFG/Nate, I would simply clarify the card can only be used to move an enemy who has not yet attacked this phase - thats the most practical way to play it anyway, as others have said.

That is incorrect.  Step three is not to reveal the shadow card, but to resolve the shadow card.  Shadow cards are not discarded until the end of the combat phase or until the enemy it is attached to is removed from play.  That means player B will still have to resolve that shadow effect when the Nazgul attacks a second time.

This is the best summarization of the issues I can come up with:

 Sneak Attack + SoA could easily be used to force the Nazgul to skip an attack, as long as it is used before the Nazgul is chosen to attack (step 1).  Here's the framework as I see it, with ** explaining what happens if SA + SoA is played at that particular time.  I'm assuming that Nazgul is attacking the Player A, and Player B is playing the card combo.

 

**If played here, Nazgul will not attack Player A, and may possibly force the Nazgul to skip its attack this round if player B has already resolved attacks against him.

1) Nazgul is chosen to attack Player A.

**If played here, Nazgul will shift its attack to Player B, enabling Player B to declare defenders during step 2.

2) Defenders are chosen.

**If played here, it will mean that the attack will be undefended against Player B, unless someone used a Sentinel character to defend.  It also means that player B will bear the brunt of any shadow cards referring to the "defending player".  The defender that Player A chose, if any, will do nothing in this attack unless it a) has Sentinel or b) has a Response pertaining to when it is declared as a defender.

3) Shadow effects are resolved.

**If played here, player A will be affected by the shadow card (and thanks to the Nazgul effect, player A will need to discard a character).  Player B will take the undefended damage.

4) Damage is resolved.

**If played here, there is not a big effect.

 

In any event, if player B uses the combo at any time during player A's defense phase, and player B has yet to resolve attacks against him, then the Nazgul will attack player B during B's defense phase also, albeit without a shadow card.



Nice summary. What I find most interesting now from this is that there is still a little sensibility for playing it at point 2) if you are defending Nazgul with Gondorian Spearman and also want Nazgul to switch a player with whom he is engaged.

 Iliemmoen, that's a great example of an instance when you'd actually want to use this combo at an odd time.

 

Kiwina, good catch.  You're absolutely right.  In the case of the Nazgul, that means that player B is also gonna lose a character :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

 

Pumpkin, I'd be pretty upset if the next FAQ contained something like that.  Surely SoA will not be the only card that can move an enemy during the combat phase, and I'd prefer a coherent framework that can handle all such cards, rather than an ad hoc ruling for each and every card.  We don't have any Actions that are restricted to some sub-part of a phase, and I'd prefer to keep the flexibility, even if there aren't a lot of reasons to use it now.

## 37 [sWhiteboy on August 14, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/51276-nazgul-ability-in-escape-from-dol-guldur/?do=findComment&comment=514384)

I just read this thread for the first time, and some of the conclusions make no sense. Specifically, the ones that include Nazgul attacking a player when they are not the active player.  The rules say, "The first player then repeats these 4 steps for each enemy that he is engaged with. After the first player has resolved all enemy attacks against himself, the player to his left resolves the attacks his enemies are making against him, following steps 1-4 in turn for each enemy."

After Nazgul switches from Player A to Player B; Nazgul's attack is now resolving against Player B.  As a result, Nazgul's attack doesn't resolve until Player B's turn, where Player B treats him like any other bad guy (meaning that Player B goes through all 4 steps, regardless of where Nazgul was in his attack cycle when he switched players).  So, your example would work like this:

 

**If SA+SoA is played here, then Nazgul will not attack Player A.  Nazgul will resolve his attacks against Player B when Player B is the Active player.

1) Nazgul is chosen to attack Player A.

**If played here, then Nazgul will not resolve the attack against Player A.  Nazgul will resolve his attacks against Player B when Player B is the Active player.

2) Defenders are chosen.

**If played here, after Player A declared a defender against Nazgul, then the declared defender will stay exhausted, but Nazgul will not resolve the attack against Player A.  Nazgul will resolve his attacks against Player B when Player B is the Active player.

3) Shadow effects are resolved.

**If played here, player A will be affected by the shadow card and Nazgul's effect.  If Player A declared a defender, then it will stay exhausted, but Nazgul will not resolve the attack against Player A.  Nazgul will resolve his attack against Player B when Player B is the Active player.

4) Damage is resolved.

**If played here, Nazgul has resolved all the steps of his attack against Player A.  Nazgul will resolve his attack against Player B when Player B is the Active player.

 

There is no rule that says an enemy can only attack once per turn.  That is why he will attack both Player A and Player B if Player B uses SA+SoA after the attack has completely resolved against Player A.

If Player B (the one who plays SA+SoA) has already had their turn as the Active player during the Combat Phase, then Nazgul will not resolve his attack against Player B.

 sWhiteboy, there is nothing in the rules to suggest that once an attack begins to resolve, it can be aborted by anything other than the death of the attacker or the elimination of the defending player.  Once an attack has begun, it MUST resolve, which means that if the Nazgul moves to player B, the attack still finishes, then attacks AGAIN when it is player B's turn.

 

The outcome you're describing is one of the three options I included in my question that Nate French answered.  He specifically stated that your outcome is NOT what happens.

The Rules say, "The first player then repeats these 4 steps for each enemy that he is engaged with. After the first player has resolved all enemy attacks against himself, the player to his left resolves the attacks his enemies are making against him, following steps 1-4 in turn for each enemy."

So, let's break it down.

1.  The first player then repeats these 4 steps for each enemy that he is engaged with.

 - The first player must resolve all 4 steps for each enemy that they are engaged with.

2. After the first player has resolved all enemy attacks against himself, the player to his left resolves the attacks his enemies are making against him...

- The first player must resolve the 4 steps of all enemy attacks made against him, before any player can resolve attacks made against him.

3.  ...following steps 1-4 in turn for each enemy.

- When any player resolves an attack made against them, they have to resolve all 4 steps.

 

I know that Nate French is a lead designer, but that doesn't mean what he says is the official answer.  This happens from time-to-time with other card games too.  For example, in the Resident Evil DBG there is a Jill card that ran into a similar issue.  The card allowed you to skip your turn, but on your next turn you would draw double the cards and have double the attacks.  At least, that is what Tylar (the lead designer) said the card did.  But, the wording of the card, in conjunction with a strict look at the rules, make it so you draw the normal amount of cards.  So, when the official FAQ came out, the FAQ decided to go with the weaker version (ignoring what the lead designer said).

So, until we have an official FAQ answer.  I have to play it like the rules say.

What happens when the bolded part changes?  One of the three possible resolutions was that the attack went through against Player A.  Nate said that this was incorrect.

I agree that we need an official FAQ answer to settle this, but "like the rules say" is open to interpretation, as the length of this thread indicates.  You and I disagree, and I'm gonna play it like Nate says.  He made the game, and he knows what he's doing.  We will just have to wait for the FAQ, I guess, but I stand by my analysis.

Sometimes I think the designer of a game has a vision of what a certain card or mechanic will do, and then balance and/or consistency require something different from the original vision.  The way I interpreted the rules was the same way you did, but in this case Nate French isn't choosing the stronger option for players.  He's choosing the one that makes the game even more challenging.  We won't know what the official ruling is until the FAQ clarify's it for us, but even FAQ's change.  FAQ 1.0 had the Dol Guldur Beastmaster and Chiertain Ufthak resolving their Forced abilities at step 1 of the combat phase, but for ver. 1.1 only Dol Guldur Beastmaster retained the change.  For now, the most official ruling is Nate French's response to radiskull, but since it isn't FAQ official we can still interpret the gameplay however we see fit.  I personally am going to go with Nate French's interpretation and add that extra challenge to the game.  If he does end up being wrong, it shouldn't be that hard to switch back.

Here's a question.  Why not just SA+SoA at the end of the Engage phase or before the Active player starts the combat steps with the specific enemy?  That would side-step any of the rules questions.

## 44 [Kiwina on August 15, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/51276-nazgul-ability-in-escape-from-dol-guldur/?do=findComment&comment=514589)

It would, and it's also the most sound strategy.  That doesn't change the fact that you can play SA after any of the steps, and SoA could be brought out at those times because of it.

I agree that the strategy is best, based on Nate's response (there are ways the attack could resolve that would make other timings more optimal).  But I would like to play a card a particular time because it's best, not because playing it at another time is simply too complicated.  Hence our lively rules debate in this and other threads. happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]

 

Good point on the FAQ reversion - hopefully this issue can be settled quickly (I hear FAQ 1.2 is in the works).

Well I understand the "flow" of these mechanics better now. But a doubt has raised into my head, concerning simultaneous effects.

Let's say that the player that uses SA+SoA did it in combat phase (for instance, before the declaration of defenders). So when he has to resolve his combat phase, he declares de SoA as a defender. He then reveals the Shadow Effect and later on (let's say that there's no shadow effect when revealed), calculates the damage. As weak as it is SoA, he will be killed with high probabilities (more if the enemy is a Nazgul, as in examples here).

So then we have a conflict between the dead of SoA and the effect of Sneak Attack. In the FAQ it is said that the player chooses the order of resolution. The player chooses, of course, SA effect.

Correct me if I did something wrong in this scenario, but I think that this way we have a pretty solid combo, because we can cancel an attack if played on the right moment, plus we can save SoA if he's going to defend.

I'm not sure there is a timing issue here, unless I misunderstand your query.

SA timing effect only comes into play at the end of the phase (as stated on the card).

SoA dies before the end of the phase (it could be the last thing that happens before the end of the phase, but it is still before...), so SoA dies and SA's card text for returning SoA into hand never comes into effect.

I have realised though that SoA and forest Snare now make a great combo, when played without SA. I'm sure that must have been posted by others, but it is one combo that has passed me by, primarily because I don't really play a Leadership sphere often and until now have always seen SoA's ability as pretty pointless - using it with forest Snare is a great option though.

I don't say I was the first but I did point that combo rather early in the game history. I find Son of Arnor very flexible and super useful in some instances.

Just when I saw the Carrock, SoA was the first card I thought of, Sneak Attack or Stand and Fight him and you do not have to worry about the troll's attack for a round. And you can then Forest Snare it if you do not finish it in one blow. Perfect to me, especially with For Gondor! Son of Arnor not only brings the enemy in after they cannot attack, he also deals 3 points of attack (instead of the usual 2), you then only need a few more characters to finish even the strongest enemies we have seen in a single attack.

Yep, I was trying out a new Leadership/tactics deck last night and For Gondor was pretty useful for taking down the troll; I think with SoA, because I mostly play solo, although i know about the tactic of the first player engaging an enemy from the 2nd player, to nulify an attack for a round, its never really been something of interest for me and as a result i think i have overlooked SoAs other uses, namely with forest snare - no more though!
