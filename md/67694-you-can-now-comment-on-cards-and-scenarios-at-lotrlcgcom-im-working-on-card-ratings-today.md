 I've added commenting on cards and scenarios at LotrLCG.com. The scenario pages also have some stats on how the deck is made up (% of enemy, location, ect) and some stats on what the average threat, defense, ect of enemy and location cards.

I hope to have card ratings done by tomorrow and you will be able to rate both the how difficult and fun a scenario is.

If there is anything else that you like to see, let me know!

i've built a few database driven sites in my time, and that's quite impressive. must have taken you years to input all the data.

the login and register buttons dont seem to work though -- just to let you know. they light up, but the links dont work. the contact button works okay though.

i dont think you'll get many comments until you fix it… because it says you need to login to post comments

 Oh boy, the ajax for the register/login buttons appears to only work in Chrome. enfadado.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/enfadado.gif]

EDIT: Works for on FireFox now.

or just use cardgameDB that has full card listing, comments rating system deck builders, forums and more.. .. .

Nice work though.. Did you also update your coc one?

if you are after some more user feedback…

i tried to register but i couldn't login. the register form accepted my email address (which is 25 characters long), but the login form doesnt. It only seems to accept a maximum of 21 characters, so i cant login.

I'm wondering if you've got a deckbuilder on the site? Maybe that appears after you login, but i cant find any links to it otherwise. You need to stick one of them on before you can start to compete with cardgamedb.

booored, When someone builds something for a player community, I think it's pretty poor form to tell people not to use it.The only extra thing cardgamedb.com has that lotrlcg.com doesn't is a deck builder and card ratings (which I'm working on next) and I have a few things his site doesn't (keyword glossary, scenario information). I also think that the layout and functionality is much better on lotrlcg.com.

mason, i'll say that i think your site is far superior -- a much better way to search. i, personally, cannot stand searching cards on CGDB. keep up the good work, it's appreciated, regardless of what others may say.

Cardgamedb is a mess. I hate going there and was only doing it when LotRLCG wasn't updated for a bit.

CGDB has stupid popup update messages, redundant menus, a main LotR page where you can't even find the card search machine, other games' garbage that I have to navigate through, and a horrible search machine that is awful.

LotRLCG is so much better.

Thanks, Mason240!

I only used CGDB for the gallery, but not anymore…bookmarked.  Thanks Mason240!

All you need is a quest log that has useful functions, not like FFGs.

Wired it looks exactly like the old CoC database and the old LoTR DB that went offline a while back.. same design and everything

I did model it after the old AGOT Dabbler site. I really liked the minimalist look and layout. Sadly though the Dabbler site is no more. This is old LotR DB you might be thinking of, it was up when the game came out last year. Then I fell about 6 months behind in updating cards (but that won't happen again, I built some back end tools to make entering new cards much, much easier).

neat… so Call of Cthulhu next :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

Also, is there a way to set it to only search player cards.. but all of them. .I see "attachments" and other options.. but would be cool to just be able to search all player cards only.

 I like the comment feature, maybe one could see recently commented cards or search by most commented?

Thumbs up for Mason240, its good that lotrlcg.com is back on track. I always loved the minimalistic approach and easy usability of that site. Thanks!

I like the options for the search, and the links to the forums and cardgameDB…

Thanks! :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

if it was me, i think i would put all the search options down the lefthand side, in a sidebar. because that is the least interesting part of the page (visually), and yet it takes up all of the top half of the screen.

people want to see information about the cards, and the game art. if you had all the search options in a thin lefthand sidebar, people could still get to them really easily, but they wont have to scroll down half a page to see what they really came for -- info about the cards.

at the moment your homepage is basically just a big search box, which is pretty bland. if you stick all that down the lefthand side, then maybe you could have all the latest comments on the rest of the screen (encouraging people to make more), and a random card from one of the latest adventure packs, complete with all the info (sort of like a spoiler, for people who haven't bought it yet).

i think you've done wonders with the backend though -- the database stuff.

…i hope you dont mind the constructive criticism. its because i like what you've done already that i'm taking the time to comment on it!

Just added it. "--Player" and "--Encounter" are the first two options in the "Type" dropdown.

I started my site the same time as Drew started cardgameDB. He already has a CoC db, and I want my next project to be something that not already existing. 

I had someone suggest an idea for a site where people could submit rules questions and then the community would vote on right awnsers, good questions, comments, ect (kind of like stackoverflow.com for programming). I got really exited about the idea, but then found stackexchange does indeed already have a boardgame site up.

http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/ [http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/]

Unless they are lacking their ability to preform at goal though, I don't think I could outdo them building a better platform.

I love hearing any ideas. I really like the idea of putting recent comments on the homescreen along with a card from the newest AP. Yes, you are absolutely right about the seach box header: it is the least interesting part and I will be thinking of some different ways to display it.

That is in fact a fantastic idea.. I didn't know stack exchange had a board game section… I'll bookmark that now.. stack exchange is amazing I am a memeber of the ubuntu c++ and gamedev exchanges and it is a never ending resource.

Still a kind of "live" faq system would be amazing…. like you look up a card and then you have a link to FAQs about that card, and more importantly the answers.. if you pulled that off it would be a really great thing as this games co-op nature makes rules a big problem.. even vetrents make mistakes all over the place :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I see cards that have comments like Ever Vigilant.  But the comments don't show up on the card's page.

 Haha, I was putting in some dummy comments to show a friend the layout. I deleted the comments, but didn't think to reset the counter (the counter is stored in a different table with the card text).
