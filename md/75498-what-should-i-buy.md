Hello I want to buy the core set and one more expansion/adventure packs:

Either the 2 expansions, dwarrowdelf and heirs of numenor, or 3 adventure packs of the first saga(hunt for gollum).

 

What is your opinion, and thanks.

the advice i always give here is go in order. then you have the theme, storyline and also you dont miss any key cards that will disadvantage you in later packs.

if you only have core set then anything after the end of the mirkwood cycle will be very dificult. you wont have any song cards so it will be hard to make multi sphere decks, and your card pool will be limited

the designers make these new quests with the current card pool in mind so difficulty increase is expected. khazad dum was hard when it came out but numenor makes it look like passage through mirkwood in comparison

so, i would say go in order, or at least start in the mirkwood cycle and leave the others until you have a few key packs

id recommend hunt for gollum as its great

I agree with Rich, go in order.  If you got KD with a core set you will be waaaaaaaayy over your head to the point it will be more frustrating than fun.
