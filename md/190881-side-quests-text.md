Hi all,

Â 

i have not seen anything about this somewhere, so i suppose everyone but me knows what is right. When a side quest is in the staging area, its text effects me as if it was a location with "forced", or it effects me only when it is current quest? The first, am i right? It would be very easy if it was the second. And i really do not expect this kindness!

The text applies whenever the side quest is in play, not just when it's the current quest.

Thank you! The rule book was not really clear to me about this... But in my heart i always knew that...
