 Here's some of mine:

 

A dwarf hero with the Lore Icon (almost certainly going to be in the big expansion).

An attachment, perhaps a new sort of song, that let's Heroes use their resources to pay for allies that don't have the matching icon, but share a trait. (ex. Theodred could pay for Horseback Archers)

I want resource generating cards for all spheres, like Steward of Gondor. Tired of holding a handful of expensive Lore allies. Bilbo needs to dig out some of Smaug's treasure and stop being stingy. I'm going to get the Sackville-Bagginses and their lawyers.

Yes, yes, I know game balance, yada yada. I still want it.

 I had an idea for a few cards:

---

Mirkwood Hunter (Lore Ally)

Cost 3

1/1/2 with 2 Health

Silvan

Text: You may play Trap attachments as if they were Events.

---

Poisoned Stakes (Lore Attachment)

Cost 3

Trap

Text: Attach to an enemy engaged with a player. Deal 2 damage to that enemy.

Forced: At the start of the Quest phase, deal 1 damage to attached enemy.

---

Mostly because I always try to play Forest Snare at instant speed :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

I wanna see a "Settra" ally card with a text that reads "When Settra enters play, you win the game".  It would be 0 cost of course...

Seriously though, I dont think we really need more resource generating cards at this point.  Having resources capped at 1 per hero now keeps card balance in check and actually makes you think about your deck construction and decision making during the game.  Steward of Gondor is already such a powerful card, we dont need alternate forms of it out on the battlefield giving players masses of resources so they can just stack their decks full of 4, 5, or 6 cost cards without even blinking an eye.

Good willpower and questing cards for non-Spirit spheres. Tactics sorely needs this! More equipment cards.

## 6 [Mighty Jim 83 on October 12, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54591-cards-that-youd-like-to-see/?do=findComment&comment=540726)

I'd love to see an alternative Hero to Aragorn:

 

"Strider"

3 2 2
4 Hit Points
Cost 12

Dunedain, Ranger

While Strider is committed to a quest, place 1 progress token on each location as it is revealed by the encounter deck.

Spirit.

 

I think there's a lot of mileage in multiple versions of characters, although others are perhaps ruled out by the time-frame:

King Elessar

3 3 3
4 Hit Points
Cost 13

Dunedain, Gondor, Noble

Exhaust King Elessar to heal all damage on any character

Lore

 hey guys! personally, I think you're not looking at the picture as a whole!

We can agree, that strangely (this game is A CO-OP GAME!!!) it seems as solo games are played more often than others - btw a bad sign for our society... 

but this game is for co-op!!! so tactics should "NEVER" have heroes or allies which are good at questing via willpower! or extra generating resources like steward of gondor! if you do that, you're essentially creating 4 SAME spheres, just with different artwork and colours.

spirit, on the other hand, should NEVER have good fighting heroes or allies... etc etc - it is the nature of this game, that the weaknesses of one player are complimented by the strenghts of another - kind of a "delegation" system - you fight, I quest! you allies, I traps and card draw, threat reduction, whatever...

so PLEASE - no second steward of gondor, no eowyn in tactics, no gimli in spirit, etc...

now: a card I'd like to see... is TOM BOMBADIL!!!! as an ally!!! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] should be expensive, like 6 or even 7 (he is the ONLY one not affected by the one ring... and that tells you something about his power - he is a maia), with a ridiculous attack, defense... and response: when he comes into play - heal all characters of all players :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

or goldberry... that would be nice, too...

I'd like to see a couple more threat reducers, a means of getting more resources, and some better armour and weapons (and some that can be played on allies please!).

'drums in the deep' (pretty sure that hasnt been spoiled? if it isnt sems like an obvious choice for khazad)

treachery

doomed 2

discard the top card from your deck and draw x cards from the encounter deck (x is the cost of discarded card) add them to the staging area

Title: Elven Bow,

Type: Attachment,

Text: Attach to a Hero, that hero now has the RANGED keyword.

I second this LOUDLY! If this game ever evolves into a mix-and-match-fest where you can basically do anything in any Sphere depending on the cards you put in... I'm OUT! Seriously. Out. Co-Op is the thing.

That's all very well, but a lot of cards, and particularly the Heroes tend to be well-established characters from Tolkien's works, and these characters already have strengths, abilities etc as established by these works, which shouldn't just be overlooked. Take the example of the two alternate versions of Aragorn I suggested above- thematic abilities for the spheres - and I think Aragorn is a character you could probably argue for ANY of the four spheres, but you can't just bust Aragorn down to 1 attack or defence if he's now a spirit hero, or reduce his willpower to one if you say he's tactics.

YES, keep the flavours of the spheres, but not at teh expense of the rich stock of Middle-Earth material we have to draw on - go too far down that route, and you'll soon have something ridiculous, like an Elf-Lord who saved Frodo from 5 Nazgul, and prevented them from entering Rivendell, suddenly ending up with only 1 defence. Oh, hang on a minute...

 I'm sorry, but it sounds like some of you are trying to destroy my dream. More resources!

The Spirit resource generator could be a Rohan ally that you discard for...wait for it...wait for it...more resources!

The Lore resource generator could be Merry or Pippen, they had a tendency to take what wasn't theirs. Something like, "When an attachment is removed, Merry/Pippen claim one resource."

Already have one for Tactics, Horn of Gondor.

None of these would be as powerful as Steward of Gondor because it doesn't really have any draw backs. You just kneel it and collect two. Easy. The other 3 would all require something else to happen for the trigger.

I'm not talking about Sphere flavors. I'm talking about resources. Leadership doesn't hold the monopoly on that as it is, thanks to the Horn.

#Occupy Rivendell! More resources for the 99%!

Extra resource generation is like extra card draws.  One sphere is awesome at it, but the other spheres can have their own unique way of doing it too.

Exactly! Generating extra resources is a Leadership thing. Other spheres either shouldn't get it at all or only in ways that are inferior to what Leadership gets.

Everytime someone asks this question, the same thought comes to my mind: ENTS!!!!!!!!!!! Never thought of myself as a huge fan of them, but for some reason, I really want to see them in the game. Seems like that won't happen anytime soon, though.

A dwarven lore guy would be nice.I want to make an all Dwarf Deck.

A splash of healing in Leadership or Spirit (not as strong as Lore)

Better Leadership allies (other than Faramir, they are simply not very good)

A third Elf hero so that my buddy can build his Elf Heroes deck

More cards keying off of traits (Ranger, Warrior, Noble, etc)

Allies and useful attachments in encounter decks (ala Grimbeorn, Rangers of Ith.) to make the scenarios even more immersive

Another resource generator for leadership (sorry it should only be a splash like the horn for any others)

A Dwarf tactics hero to replace Thalin in another buddy's 3 Dwarves deck

Another card beside Miner to remove conditions - probably fits in spirit

Leadership Card that keys off sentinel to help me justify sticking with Aragorn in my primary deck (I will anyway)

A spirit ally who can be discarded to reduce threat

A splash of threat reduction in Lore or Leadership (not as strong as spirit)

Some sort of Gandalf's Fireworks card that would act as a distraction of sorts to deflect damage would be cool and kind of fun.

Some hobbit specific cards...

Wonder how Gandalf the White would turn out?

Will they ever print a Sauron encounter card? Maybe you can recreate the fight when they defeated him the first time... that would be cool. In my opinion at least.

Sauron Himself???? Probably not...... In Lotr tcg by Decipher was A Sauron card. He was very powerful minion. But so expensive cost.......

Yeah. I want ents too!

I also want some more Rohan stuff that isn't just Spirit.

Personally, Spirit has always seemed like an odd fit for the Rohirrim to me. I think of Leadership and especially Tactics when I think of the Riders of Rohan. I think we should get more elf stuff for Spirit.

 

I'm not sure who would make any kind of sense really (with the established time-frame*), but I'd like more Hobbits too. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

"they" don't have the rights to Silmarillion... and then they could print Feanor, Thorondor, Ungolianth, Morgoth, too... no way!!! That's a WHOLE different time age!!! that would be against all laws of Tolkien's world... at least the cards would not be compatible with the "new" ones... the game is SET BETWEEN Bilbo's Birthday and Frodo's departure! (frodo is 33 on bilbo's 111th birthday...)

 

as to sauron: I see the same problem as with the Balrog - storywise you just CAN'T meet either of them - how about that:

 

The Fellowship: Oh, Caradhras is cruel and blocking the way... where shall we go?

Gimli: Moria!!!! My cousin Balin...

Gandalf: BUT, the BALROG!!!

Aragorn: No problem, Gandi, we already defeated him 17 years ago, you remember that little quest in the Deluxe AP???

Gandi: Oh yeah, sure!!! We'll just march through!

Legolas: Yes, and we also killed Sauron! Those were the days... now THAT was a hard quest...

Boromir: Anyone know, why we're still bringing the One Ring to Mordor??? gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]

I had an idea for a resource generating hero.  Have a tactics hero that earns resources for kills.  This would be similar to how Legolas works, only with resources instead of progress.  Also, I'd like to see dwarves in the spirit sphere.

Well, we've also defeated a Nazgul at Dol Guldur, so why not? If the Nazgul can come back, maybe so can the Balrog. Also how many heroes and allies from the trilogy have already been killed by enemies and treacheries in your games?

Well, borrowing a line from "Prince of Persia: Sands of Time" (the game, not the movie): "No, no, no.  That's not what happened."
