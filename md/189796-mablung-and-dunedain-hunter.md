Since the Dunedain Hunter tells you to put an enemy into play "engaged" with you and Mablung says "after you engage an enemy", does one add a resource to Mabung for the enemy that you grab with Dunedain Hunter?

 

I think I remember the rules or a FAQ addressing this, basically stating that no matter how an enemy ends up "with" you that you are both considered to have engaged it and it is considered to have engaged you. I think that this topic has been discussed as far back as Hummerhorns...So, I am thinking that, although the literal English on the cards would lead on to believe that you do not get the resource, the LOTR LCG rules say that you do?

In the FAQ:

Q: If an enemy is put into play directly engaged with me, has that enemy “engaged” me for the purposes Forced effects or Responses that trigger from engaging an enemy?

A: Yes. An enemy that enters play directly engaged with a player has engaged that player.

Awesome. I feel a little silly now for asking it when it is right there in the FAQ. For some reason I thought that the answer was more complicated. Thank you so much!

There's no need to feel silly.

 

(except if we had a forum for silly questions - there it would be a requirement to feel silly)

Here's a follow-up question: does Mablung give a resource during engagements during setup, or is that not considered a 'phase'?

 

And: if tactics Aragorn keeps engaging enemies during the combat phase, doesn't Arwen get jealous?

1) Yep. That's why he is so cool.

 

2) Only if the enemy has a low defense, I guess.
