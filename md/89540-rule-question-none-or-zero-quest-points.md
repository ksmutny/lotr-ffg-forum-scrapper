Hey everyone,

 

so you need equal the amount or more of progress tokens on a quest card to complete it. So if a quest card needs zero progress tokens, our reasoning was, that you need at least so much willpower as the threat count currently is. This doesn't result in any surplus, but isn't needed, because zero == zero (so for those quest, >= 0 would be needed). Is this correct?

 

But why are there cards where no value is printed and quest cards with the value zero?

What quest are you referring to? Normally if a quest requires zero progress there's a condition that needs to be meat. As soon as it is fulfilled the quest is done.

Well, ok... the one with the zero is "Don't leave the Path!" for example, where there are clearly things to be done to finish the quest.

 

But what about all other ones like "A chosen Path" for example. No text, no required quest points. At first I thought: ok, it's being resolved as soon as it is revealed. But that would be too easy, wouldn't it? So the we thought ok, you at least need a round with zero or more progress markers left when "Resolve questing"...

Hm, I'm not sure I quiet follow you here. "A chosen path" is the name of both quest cards for step 3A in the Passage through mirkwood quest. The A side of a quest does never require progress. There MIGHT be a condition you need to do right before you flip it to side B.

In the example you have given this is what to do:

When you defeat quest card 2B you imidiately go on to choose one of the two "A chosen path" quest cards. Now, depending on which one you "draw" this is what you do:

Drawing "Beon's path": Here you need to defeat Ungoliath Spawn IF it's in play or if it is revealed to the staging area while trying to defeat this last step. If it never is revealed or is in the discard pile and you reach the 10 progress you win imidiately.

Drawing "Don't leave the path": Here every player need to find one spider and put it into play. If Ungoliaths spawn is not in play one should find it. If you just play solo you just search and find Ungoliath and place it in the staging area. Now as soon as Ungoliath is defeated you win. No progress is needed here BUT you must defeat Ungoliath in this step 3B quest. If you already have defeated it or for some other reason it is in the discard pile you need to take it out and defeat it again.

Hope this helps :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
