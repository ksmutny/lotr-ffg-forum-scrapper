# [Where do you discard from for Ride to Ruin and Rear Guard?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54165-where-do-you-discard-from-for-ride-to-ruin-and-rear-guard/)

Rear Guard
'... Discard a (Leadership) ally to give...'

Ride to Ruin
'... Discard a Rohan ally to...'



Previous cards have said;

Protector of Lorien
'... Discard a card from your hand to... '



I understand that the initial article previewing Rear Guard implied it was from play.
Is there any other info somewhere?


Cheers

I believe it has been confirmed that the card is discarded from play only.

If not stated otherwise the card must be in play. It's mentioned somewhere in the rulebook. Let me see...

Got it: rule book p. 25

 

In Play and Out of Play
"In play" refers to cards that have been played or put
into play (in a player’s play area), to cards that are
waiting in the staging area, to the currently revealed
quest card, and to encounter cards that are engaged
with that player. "Out of play" states are" in a player's
hand," "in a deck," or "in a discard pile.” Card effects
do not interact with cards in an out of play state unless
the effect specifically refers to that state.

 

Last sentence. Cards in your hand are not in play. So they cant be used to pay.
