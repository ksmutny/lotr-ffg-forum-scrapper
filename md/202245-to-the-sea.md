Yes, indeed!

 

But, what you really need to do is live the dream of playing with all three eleven ring-bearers at once! 36 starting threat? ...whatever

Who says you need Hero Gandalf and his 14 threat? OHaUH Gandalf is an even better target for Narya! 

 

Though if you want to run all the other Gandalf attachments then yeah, Hero Gandalf is probably a better bet. Plus, Hero Gandalf+Elrond+Vilya=insane.

> Can ally Gandalf target himself with Narya, exhaust for the cost and then ready for the effect?

 

It sounds wrong, but from the wording I would say this is perfectly fine, as I think (correct me if I am wrong) you are supposed to execute a card "step by step". So first you have to exhaust character + Narya, what allows you to choose up to 2 allies. At this point you are allowed to choose and ally Gandalf is exhausted, so he should be a valid target .

 

The card reads: "exhaust to choose", so you can't choose if you didn't exhaust Gandalf (in this case), and when you are allowed to choose nothing says you can't target the (completly exhausted) character, you used to pay the cost.

 

No garantee this is right, but it's how I understand the card and would play it.

 

Only Problem could be, if exhausting and choosing should happen at the same time (but from the card text it doesn't sound like this would be the case)

Don't see why not. Like @Calvadur said you are exhausting the ring and attached character to pay the cost. Unless it states otherwise I see no reason why the exhausted Gandalf isn't eligible to be stood back up. 

 

Still need to deal with the 2 threat every turn but it's a powerful effect. Especially if you have other big allies available to stand. And you would still get the 4 willpower every turn from his ability.

Interesting (from a marketing point of view) that the suggested deck is made with cards from the grey haven and the core set only, as if FFG wants to say that you don't need to have all the card pool to enjoy the new quests. Did they ever do it for Heirs of Numenor, Last Realm or Voice of Isengard?

That's interesting. As someone who is only up through Dwarrowdelf, I was almost considering just jumping straight to Grey Havens next just so I could participate more in some of the discussions here and the go backfill the other releases over time.

 

I'm also tempted to splurge on a bunch of stuff just to get player cards and then start with the Grey Haven's quests.

It varies. The decks they posted in articles before Lost Realm was released definitely did use some other expansions (heroes included Frodo and Sam, don't remember about other deck content), but I think they try to put up decklists using not too many different expansions so it's more likely people can actually put them together with a limited card pool. I know the rulesheet for Black Riders contains a suggested decklist using only Core + Black Riders. And I'm pretty sure all the decklists they give in articles or rulesheets only assume 1 copy of the Core Set.

This goes all the way back to the very first Second Breakfast article:
https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2013/3/19/second-breakfast/ [https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2013/3/19/second-breakfast/]

 

You'll notice that multiple core sets are needed to build this deck. There was a lot of feedback on the forums about players with one core set not being able to build this deck.

 

When the next Second Break article came out:
https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2013/4/12/second-breakfast-second-helpings/ [https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2013/4/12/second-breakfast-second-helpings/]

It included this statement:
"Since then, several players have wondered if Caleb would be willing to post a deck built with only one copy of the game’s Core Set, and others questioned how the deck can function in multiplayer games, when the rising threats of other players’ decks would seem to render its ability to attack cards in the staging area less effective."

 

And the community rejoiced!

Has anyone asked Caleb about this one? Going to make some very serious changes to my decks if OhaUh Gandalf and Narya do indeed work like this.

I honestly don't see why do you even need to ask Caleb of that. You exhaust Gandalf, you choose Gandalf. Gandalf is eligible target as he is an ally, being exhausted is not even a requirement as it reads "choose and ready up to 2 allies", not "choose up to 2 exhausted allies and ready them".

If Gandalf is not exhausted you can't ready him and therefore don't pick him for the effect I would say.

 

I think FFG didn't bother writing "ready exhausted ally" as not exhausted ones can't be readied.

No reason to ask Caleb.  We Are Not Idle has two effects based on the same sentence structure (Do X to Y).  It has been asked and clarified that you can choose to draw the card first or add the resources first.  This means, that the do X to Y structure does not happen simultaneously.  If it did, you would not be able to choose which Y you perform first following X.  Even if they are simultaneous (and I'm incorrectly remembering the thing about We Are Not Idle), though, when two things happen at the same time, isn't it true that the first player chooses the order?  So then, why not choose the most beneficial order in the case of Narya/OHaUH Gandalf.

See, what you present here is your assumptions. What I wrote there is facts. You don't assume FFG didn't bothered to write something for some reason, you do exactly what the card tells you to do.

That ring seems to be somewhat overpowered. So I put in on ally Gandalf and I get a new leadership hero? Who can ready himself and one other ally for free? Who can boost stats? For only 2 resources?

He doesn't turn into a hero, he doesn't gather resources and you still need to raise your threat by two every round.

## 35 [leptokurt on February 15, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/202245-to-the-sea/?do=findComment&comment=2052554)

Ok, so getting a resource icon is not enough to gather resources?

 

* checks rules *

 

You're right!

 

The threat issue is almost neglectable with all the opportunities to lower your threat or to turn high threat into an advantage. 2 cost still seems to be too cheap.

 

IMO ally Gandalf would help Dunedain decks quite a lot if he had that ring. He could block 2 enemies with 5 DEF all alone, and another defender could block 2 more attacks if neccessary.

Just a fun fact - all non-neutral allies technically have a resource icon.

He has to exhaust to use the ring, so you'd only get 1 defence out of him unless you ready him some other way.

Is this true? The only definition of resource icon in the rulebook comes in the "Anatomy of a card" section and says they are "found only on Hero cards". The corresponding icon on allies has a different name.

## 39 [John Constantine on February 15, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/202245-to-the-sea/?do=findComment&comment=2052598)

Well, according to the recent Sword-thain ruling (which by the way states nothing about resource icons in its own text), the sphered allies have the resource icon by default, otherwise they wouldn't be able to pay for anything of their color once they become heroes.

But it is important whether you can use the Narya effect on ready allies or not. I believe it is a fact that only exhausted allies can be readied. There have already been many instances I wanted to give the stat bonus to a ready ally with Narya, but I couldn't (at least if I understand the rules correctly).

If ally Gandalf  could get a sphere with his ring, would you be able to Sword-thain him, and at last turn him into a hero?

AFAIK this is possible, and would be a sight to behold. OTOH it's an order-dependent, 3-card combo that costs 11 resources, so I imagine it would be hard to get out on the table. I guess you could shave that down to 7 resources by using Sneak Attack, but that's a 4th card...

Other than thematic reasons why would you want to do this? 

 

If we're talking about Core Gandalf then you don't usually want him to stay around since he is more effective bouncing in and out of play and triggering his drop-effect multiple times. 

 

OHaUH Gandalf is a little bit of a better choice but again--why? You would gain a leadership resource (the cheapest resources) each turn. And he would still commit to the quest for 4 each round. But he would lose the ability to ready himself each turn (and get the bonus) and he would still cost you the 2 threat per turn. 

 

At that point, I think you would be better off just running Hero Gandalf.

Just to show that Boromir isn´t the only hero with very powerful stats that requires threat reduction. With Galadriel (hero), the combo is not impossible. I do not like the existing hero Gandalf, so I want my OHUH version to be a hero.

 

A even better thing: Neutral attachment. cost 1. Attach to a Istari character. Attached character gains the Gandalf name.

 

Then I could turn the BETTER wizard into the CORRECT White Wizard hero.

Five attack without Beorns limitation...

And with that weather from the Weather Hills, he remains the whole game!

So this is available in the UK now - my preorder was waiting for me when I got home from work. About to try the first quest.

I was hoping that there would be something in the rules about not using mounts on board ships, but no such luck. Perhaps the ships are big enough for them to be riding around on deck. I suppose that's no weirder than eagles in moria, though.

You can house-rule that.

I know I will, as a thematic (and more often than not easy mode) player.

If a 3 rings deck is what you want, what's preventing you from including a Gandalf hero from the get go?

## 55 [DarkPhoenix on February 22, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/202245-to-the-sea/?do=findComment&comment=2065371)

Threat cost.

 

But really, nothing. I was just little saddened when i realised you cant sword-thane Gandalf because he is neutral. And i was waiting for the 3rd ring to come out. 

And then the ring comes out and fixes everything

 

And i love how those rings are tricky.

Gandalf is going to be raising your threat by 2 each turn even after he becomes a hero, plus setup it will require to actually make him a hero in the first place :o [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_ohmy.png]

I added Narya to my hobbit secrecy deck (with Spirit Merry) and getting that on Gandalf mid-game is pretty awesome.   Being able to buff himself or to ready and buff two others depending on the situation really helps add to the usefulness of the deck.  But it's unlikely to every be worth including Sword Thain for him.

Solo deck? or paired with something?

## 60 [John Constantine on March 3, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/202245-to-the-sea/?do=findComment&comment=2082878)

Solo. Packed with a lot of fat, costy allies being played in rapid succession.

## 61 [Slothgodfather on March 3, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/202245-to-the-sea/?do=findComment&comment=2082913)

I'm curious what allies you are going to use to get reliable attack strength with two spirit and a lore hero.

## 62 [John Constantine on March 3, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/202245-to-the-sea/?do=findComment&comment=2082941)

Currently I'm looking at:

x1 Damrod

x1 Elfhelm

x2 Northern Tracker

x3 Hama

x3 Sailor of Lune

 

...from the Spirit. I'm also looking at x1-3 Warden of Annuminas.

 

From Lore:

x1 Anborn

x1 Galdor of the Havens

x3 Ithilien Lookout

x1 Quickbeam

x3 Wandering Ent

 

There are some neutrals I'm currently considering:

x3 Envoy of Pelargir

x3 Gandalf of Core

x3 Ranger of Cardolan

x1 Treebeard

 

I'll have to get the stuff into my hands and play with it before I'll start the fine-turning, but this is approximately the list of allies I intend to include into this deck.

Man, the wait is killing me. I am observing AGOT 2ED spoilage at the same time and there are spoilers like 10 times more frequently. It's so depressing. We still don't have 2 last packs official announcements X_X

I'm torn between wanting to know and wanting them to slow down how far in advance they spoil things so it doesn't feel like an eternity to get it in my hands.

FFG sends spoilers to Thrones podcasts. Would be nice if they did that for LotR.

It's rather curious. Most of the other LCGs have over half of the cards in each pack spoiled before the official release. This game is substantially different. I don't know if it's better of worse. I'm curious if it's an official and measured decision or if it's just a product of who the designers and marketing people are assigned to each game.

You mean spoilers like the Minas Tirith Lampwright, and the Mirkwood Pioneer, and Fair and Perilous, and Strider?

You can add Galadhon Archer which was spoiled by Couple vs. Cardboard.

 

I interpreted Kakita Chiro's comment to be related to normalized data. Community spoiled cards per release appears to be very low compared to other LCGs.

It would be nice if they did it more. That's 4 cards in going on 6 cycles.

I think it is definitely 100% worse.... if you didn't want to look at spoilers you could just not... for those who do want spoilers and tidbits and what not there is next to nothing and at an extremely slow rate too.... sometimes large stretches of time will pass with no spoilers and this definitely doesn't help the forums stay active either.

I get that if they release too many spoilers too early it kills the actual excitement and build up when the pack is released.

The thing is though about a week before the pack is officially released a few random people have it already from a single store that somehow had it before anyone else or before FFG OR it came out in Spain or another random country like a week earlier. We then get all the spoilers like a week out (player cards at least) from it being available across the US. I live in Australia so I usually see every single card including encounter cards before I get my hands on the actual product anyway..... I think quite a few people are in the same or similar situations (almost everyone out side of the US really) and so we have everything spoiled or at least available to view online far before we get our hands on the cards anyway..... so why not spoil things a little further out? 

If they had the same international release date for products (like MtG) then this wouldn't be an issue but they do not have anything like this and release dates are different in every country. 

 

Also lots of people use proxies, the more spoilers we get the more future player cards we can proxy to try out new mechanics and concepts in advance (legal official cards mind you, just ones not yet released) which keeps people interested and excited for the new packs and mechanics. 

It would generate far more discussion on the forums and they would be far more active if there was a steady release of spoilers leading up to a release and I also think that many cards that are a bit more situational or weak would get more attention than they normally would. Lets say a single card is spoiled, many people may want to try it out and discuss it simply because it is new and shiny and exciting. If that card is spoiled at the same time as others and is lacklustre or nowhere near as exciting or broadly useful as the other cards there is going to be very little discussion about it. If spoiled on its own far more people will discuss and potentially even try out that card. Imagine if we had some sort of Card of the Week thing where a single player card from the current/upcoming cycle is spoiled to generate discussion and to allow us to try these new cards out in anticipation. 

I think this would work very well and they could spoil the hero last, the week before release. I think this would actually add to excitement rather than take away from it because it would be like oh my god did you see how amazing Thranduil is? I cannot WAIT to get the pack next week to play with him or alternatively those who proxy cards would get to use him right before release if they really wanted to but still have the excitement of the actual new quest itself to look forward to as well as using the real cards (don't know about you guys but getting to remove proxies and put in the real cards is an awesome feeling!) 

This is just my opinion however and I totally get where people opposed to this would be coming from as it is key to keep certain things a surprise to actually promote and sell the product in the first place. That being said however you totally can just ignore spoilers and the whole stupid defense of; I don't want spoilers but if there are any I can't help but look at them so there shouldn't be any, is just insanely ridiculous and selfish. If you don't want to look at them don't, if you do look but claim you didn't want to don't try to blame that on something/someone else you just couldn't help yourself/have bad self control. 

I don't think anything will change though, I think that they have a very unique situation and set up with this game (especially because its co-op and the whole concept of encounter cards) and prefer to keep it a little more secretive and provide less spoilers in advance. They have to find a balance between encounter cards and player cards to show us in articles as well and often will show us ONLY encounter cards in an article to stop us from knowing anything about the player cards in the pack...

Due to there being more spoilers for most other FFG games I would assume it has to do with the individuals who design and market this game. At the end of the day they can do what they want, its the best goddamn card game ever set in the greatest fictional world ever  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]  It would be nice to get more spoilers but whatever!

Great point about the forums. Just think about the explosion of posts when the Strider card was spoiled on CotR.
