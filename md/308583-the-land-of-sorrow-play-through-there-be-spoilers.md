# [The Land of Sorrow Play-through (There Be Spoilers)](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/308583-the-land-of-sorrow-play-through-there-be-spoilers/)

## 1 [Preotet on May 22, 2020](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/308583-the-land-of-sorrow-play-through-there-be-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=3942986)

I really enjoyed reading asgardianphil's trials and tribulations of his path through Ash Mountains and was inspired to do something similar myself. After failing miserably time after time I decidedÂ  I will instead focus on Land of Sorrow because 1) it's much easier ðŸ˜„Â and 2) to give potential readers a brief feel of the quest. So ... I've played this quest 5 times, now. Twice I've won, twice I've lost. Below is my 5th try.

Â 

Forth, the Three Hunters! (Gandalf, Tactics Eowyn, Spirit Glorfindel)

51 cards deck, starting threat 25

Initial draw: 2x Unexpected Courage, Dagger of Westernesse, Gondorian Shield, Golden Shield, A Test of Will

Mulligan: Feint, Shadowfax, Light of Valinor, Herugrim, Golden Belt, The Galadhrim's Greeting

Â 

Setup: Add eachÂ CampÂ location to the staging area. Attach a randomÂ CaptiveÂ objective-ally to eachÂ CampÂ location as a guarded objective. Place one randomÂ WardenÂ enemy faceup (but not in play) under eachÂ CampÂ location. Shuffle the encounter deck and discard cards from the top until X locations are discarded, where X is 1 less than the number of players. Add each location discarded this way to the staging area.

Â 

1B (15 QP)

EachÂ CampÂ location is immune to player card effects, and players cannot travel there while aÂ WardenÂ enemy is in play.Â 

Forced:Â At the end of the round, raise each player's threat by 1 for eachÂ CampÂ location in the staging area.

Â 

You can't defeat this stage unless you control all three objective-allies.

Â 

Turn 1

QP: Staging area: Slave Quarters (1), The Storehouse (1), The Barracks (1)

Eowyn and Glorfindel quest for 9 WP

Reveals Working Fields (3) - While Working Fields is in the staging area, characters cannot be healed. Travel: Each players deals 1 damage to a character he controls.

9 WP vs 6 threatÂ = 3 progress on main quest

TP: I decided to travel to The Barracks (5 quest points, Forced: After The Barracks becomes the active location, add the enemy under it to the staging area. That enemy cannot take damage this round. Forced: When the Barracks is explored, the first player gains control of the objective ally it was guarding.) because the forced effect was not as harsh as the effects on the other two Camp locations. TheÂ enemy I added to staging area was Ulwarth (3 threat, 4A, 1D and 6H). The guarded captive underneath The Barracks was Silvan Endrahil with responseÂ After Edrahil quests successfully, choose a player to draw 1 card.

EP: DecidesÂ not to engage Ulwarth (his engagement cost is 34). This made me sweat for a few rounds.

EP+CP: 1 damage to Glorfindel because of Archery 1 on Watch Tower. Optionally engages Ulwarth to remove threat from the staging area and deals him a shadow card.

Cool game. Just a question how many times did you play The Galadhrim's Greeting? I counted like five...

Yep. Five times. I packed Will of the West.

And they were apparentely all needed since you ended up at 33 threat still. Seems like a quest where you need to pack A LOT of threat management.

Yes. Camp locations raise your threat in addition to normal raise. But you can't clear them every turn because 1) of other pesky locations and 2) you must first remove Warden enemy before you can travel to the next Camp location.

Was it just me, or were you not raising your threat by 1 at the beginning of the refresh phase?

Thank You, though, I love hearing other players' games!

I think I did correctly. 1 normal + 2 for the Camp locations in the staging area.

Im surprised that Ash Mountains seems harder because the difficultly rating on Land of Sorrow I thought was 9? I am aware that the difficulty ratings usually don't mean much, but still, a rating of 9 must be hard. Or was it Ash Mountains with a 9?

## 11 [Preotet on May 22, 2020](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/308583-the-land-of-sorrow-play-through-there-be-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=3943139)

Ash Mountains is rated 7, Sorrow 9 and Nurn 10. Maybe it's one of those things that difficulty depends on a number of players. For solo, Sorrow is for sure easier of the three.

Yeah, I hope you get it as soon as possible. At this moment in time, I think it's the best quest in the cycle.

We just finished playing against The Land of Sorrow, it was a brutal quest but we were still able to win it at the first attempt (despite some terrible luck during the first quest phase).

This quest surely likes to pile up damage on you, I am sure that if we didn't have a dedicated healing deck (basically a Lore deck with Elrond and all the possible healing effects) we would not have gone past it. MVP was Dunedain Remedy, one turn saw it heal like 30 damage between all 4 decks).

Hard but satisfying quest, less punishing than Under the Ash Mountains since it's more traditional in the difficulties you have to overcome. We were constantly at the edge of defeat but prevailed with a good strategy and a little luck. Dang if they are annoying those Wardens.

Now onto Escape from Khazad-Dum before we have to change our decks for The Fortress of Nurn.
