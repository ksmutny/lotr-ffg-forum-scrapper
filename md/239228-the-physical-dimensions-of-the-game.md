Hopefully an easy question for some of you: has anyone calculated how many cards the game at the moment has? No need for last digit precision, just of the order of magnitude. I'm considering changing storage system, but numbers are a bit unclear - of course, I could open Excel and start adding, but if someone has already done the count, all the better :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

Thanks in advance!

If you have everything (excluding nightmare), you should be at around 5,000 cards.  Roughly 2,900 encounter cards, 300 quest cards, and 1,800 player cards.

Thanks. Does this include Nightmare as well?

Not separating player vs. encounter vs. quest:

 

Each Cycle has 525 cards, except the first which has 586 (the Core Set is slightly larger than a Deluxe).

 

The Sagas contain ~1100 cards themselves.

 

POD ~400 or so.

 

Nightmare is, I think, ~20 cards per scenario, and they've released Nightmare for 4 complete cycles, 1/2 of the fifth cycle, and 4 saga boxes, so ~1000 Nightmare cards.

My numbers don't include Nightmare.  I suppose I should better define "everything".

So, somewhere between 6K and 6.5K including Nightmare. It's safe assumption that at the end of the Harad cycle, with the last saga out and all adventures being released in Nightmare format, it could be something more than 7.5K cards (unless of course they decide to expand it more after Harad)

 

Thanks guys!

In 2016, LotR has exceeded the game of thone lcg(1st edition) and became the lcg which has the most cards, it already contains more than 6,000 cards, over 1,600 player cards.

Why do you mean by "unless they decide to expand it"? Do you think Harad will be the last cycle??

I don't have an opinion on the matter, nor the company has disclosed anything beyond Harad and the last chapter in the saga. What comes next, I don't know. I just needed to understand how big's the game to assess whether I can afford moving to a different storage system or not. Thinking "maybe in two years from now we'll have 2K more cards" is not what I'm interested in at the moment

I see. I would be more concerned about the weight though, as 5k cards can be pretty heavy. I was considering a custom made box to fit around 6k cards, but the weight of it made me decide against it to prevent breaking my back everytime I wanted to move them. I switched to 2 smaller boxes, one for the encounter cards and another for the player cards.

I've put encounter cards in a box (an outgrown former Dominion box, which is now outgrown by LOTR quests), and player cards in a couple of binders.  Encounter cards by their nature need to be kept together, while player cards by their nature need to be by themselves and easily found.

A few years ago I tried to do the same thing and figured that the game would last at least through the end of the last saga box and then figured out how much storage I would need. I pretty much nailed it as my binders are nearly full.

I hope I have to buy new binders.

Yup, weight could be a problem. But I won't be keeping all of them in the same place. I'll be using these boxes here [http://www.basicallywooden.co.uk/our-collections/card-game-boxes/]; the birtch wood should be sturdy enough not to deform under the weight of the cards (after all they were designed specifically for these games, and at the moment I found only positive reviews), and in any case there's room for 3300 unsleeved cards, so, I think 2K sleeved or so, so, I'll be in need for at least 3 of these dudes here.

 

I got lucky with some unexpected money coming from an external job, and ordered the first box yesterday (yes, with the One Ring writings engraved on the top lid). If there's interest from the community, I'll post a couple of pictures of it once I stored the first chunk of the collection in it)

That is a lovely box.
