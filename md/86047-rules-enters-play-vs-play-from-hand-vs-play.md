# [Rules: Enters Play vs Play from Hand vs Play](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86047-rules-enters-play-vs-play-from-hand-vs-play/)

So for a while, I thought it was just the two basic responses Enters Play (including Sneak Attack, Stand and Fight, A Very Good Tale, etc., the cards that usually put other cards in play) or the obvious Play from Hand.

 

But even during the core set era, I noticed Erebor Hammermsmith has a different wording, just stating "after you play...". This leads me to ask this here, since now we see the same wording with Lord of Morthond. And I am doing it here, instead of the official ffg way, in case some of you have already asked it and got the answer.

 

To be plain: when the card reads "after you play", what does it actually mean?

when you pay for it in the default manner.

ps: Of course I understand "enters play" basically includes "after you play from hand"

> when you pay for it in the default manner.

But what is then the difference between play from hand and play? Especially if, as with Lord of Morthond, the cards in questions are allies, not events?

Basically any card that references a card being 'played' is the same as 'playing from hand.'  They are interchangeable.  So you 'play' Kili(you also 'play him from your hand'), but when you go search for Fili and he 'enters play,' these are two different things, and a card like Legacy of Durin would only trigger once.

 

For Lord of Morthond, you would just have to pay for each ally and put them into play, and you would be able to draw a card.

Hmm, so is it really they have two different wordings for one single thing? I thought as much for Erebor Hammersmith during the core set era, but I would like to hear official explanation now. Till then, I play it as you guys say, it makes sense. Thanks.

Yes, I believe it had to be referenced in the FAQ for things such as Kili/Fili not triggering Legacy of Durin

Welcome to LoTR-LCG. not even the designers know how to play this game. The FAQ has had complete turn arounds on rules between versions, making a card legal to do one thing in one faq and then it can not in the next faq. We have had card erratad and then errated again as the last errata broke game rules. The "ask the designers" email system has returned rulings that are completely incorrect when you read the rules and the faq. The amount of times these have be reversed in a faq is a joke. We have different events using the same keywords .. it is a real mess. get used to it.
