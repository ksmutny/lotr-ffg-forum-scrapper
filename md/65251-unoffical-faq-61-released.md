Hi,

I don't know if this has already been posted but I just wanted to inform you that a new version of the 'Lord of the Rings LCG Comprehensive Card Reference & Unofficial FAQ' by Kirk Bauer has been released. This is IMO a great document for getting quick help when playing LOTR LCG. Easier to use than the official FAQ and updated more frequently.

The new update is available from boardgamegeek.com/filepage/66894/comprehensive-card-reference-unofficial-faq [http://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/66894/comprehensive-card-reference-unofficial-faq] or directly from Kirk's homepage at www.kaybee.org/kirk/LoTR_LCG_Cards_and_FAQs.pdf [http://www.kaybee.org/kirk/LoTR_LCG_Cards_and_FAQs.pdf].

 

Kirk has also released a quick turn quide: www.kaybee.org/kirk/LoTR_LCG_QuickRef.pdf [http://www.kaybee.org/kirk/LoTR_LCG_QuickRef.pdf] which is also a good help for breaking down the game phases.
