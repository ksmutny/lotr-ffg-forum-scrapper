Quick question - does anyone know if we add three threat in addition to the normal threat we get at the end of the round?  Or does that player only get an automatic three threat each turn in total?

Thanks!

no you always have to add the 1 point each turn

Yep, Rich is right. Gollum's effect is separate from the compulsory threat gain at the end of each round. This is part of the reason RtM can be pretty tough for a solo player--you'll be raising your threat by a minimum of four each round.

thats why i can always have a 5 minute game with return to mirkwood, seeing as the game only last about 5 rounds!lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif]

It can be won solo though. I've won 4 out of 11 with my primary deck built to try to beat all the SoM quests (Aragorn, Imrahil, Eowyn with a splash of green for healing).  If you are playing blue, besides the obvious threat management cards, try to get Elfhelm in early.  He'll get you one of the threats back if you can keep or get him readied at the end of the turn with his special.  Three per turn is still pretty brutal, but it beats four per turn.
