I have two campaign mode related questions:

First, do boon effects count as player card effects? For example, in the two Dire scenarios (Black Gate and Mount Doom) can you use the boon Three Golden Hairs to lower each player's threat by three, or is it reduced to one?

Second, in the scenario The Uruk-Hai, when earning the Skill boons, can they be attached to the captive heroes chosen, or only the ones you used in the scenario?

1. It's mentioned right in the rule book...

"Dire is a new keyword that appears on some quest cards in The Mountain of Fire. The dire keyword represents the world-changing endeavors that the heroes of Middle-earth undertook in the final book of The Lord of the Rings. While the main quest has the dire keyword, each player’s threat elimination level is increased to 99 and each player’s threat cannot be reduced by more than 1 each round by non-boon player card effects. Boon card effects that reduce a player’s threat are not affected by the dire keyword."

2. You can attach those boons to heroes you control. At the conclusion of that quest you've rescued them and therefore control them again.

What about Mr. Underhill? Can that be used on the Witch-King?

No. Boons are considered player cards and therefore won't work against cards that are immune to them.

One more question. 

The Andúril boon says:

Response: After an attack in which the attached hero defended resolves, exhaust Andúril to target the enemy that just attacked. Declare attached hero as an attacker against that enemy (and resolve the attack).

If attached to a Sentinel hero, can this be used to essentially make a ranged attack?

Yes, like Grimbeorn this can be used to attack non-engaged enemies you happened to defend against.
