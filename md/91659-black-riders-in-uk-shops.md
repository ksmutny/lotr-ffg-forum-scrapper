Has anyone found Black Riders in a UK shop? I don't mean online store, since some of those get their supply straight from the US release.

 

I've rung quite a few local shops that haven't got it as yet :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

Really? I live in Iceland and we're usually many weeks behind the UK and US in receiving new releases. But BR has been available here since september 30th.

Depends on deliveries really. it is out in the UK, just depends if your local has it or not.

I picked mine up in Newcastle Upon Tyne today so it's definitely out in some places in the UK (as well as the new Netrunner pack, apparantly).

UK releases are updated on this website. Esdevium supply FFG products in the UK, so when they say something will be out, it will be out.

Thebookdepository still doesn't have it. Does anyone know when it will be available?

You know, someone said the same thing a while ago but I couldn't see any list on their site. Just gone back now, scrolled to the bottom of the page and found it! Black Riders is down for 7th Oct. I'll ring my local stores again tomorrow.

Got it! Manchester Travelling Man has a good supply if anyone is struggling in the area.
