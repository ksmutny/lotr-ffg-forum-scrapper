I found this great template for hero designing over on BoardGameGeek (http://www.boardgamegeek.com/filepage/70314/hero-card-template-300dpi-psd [http://www.boardgamegeek.com/filepage/70314/hero-card-template-300dpi-psd]).  The guy who designed it has done all the hard work in terms of hero symbols and text and everything.  All you need to do is type and find a picture (You need photoshop or similar to open the file).  

Anyway, Here is (another) take on Bilbo with an emphasis on the burglar aspect.  Also wanted to give secrecy some love!  

(Removed original)

Let me know what you think and have a go with some of your own.

 Made a slight change to Bilbo and found a better picture.  Also had a go at Orophin.

I do like the Elf. I really hope (and think) stuff like that, camouflage of sorts, will be incorporated into the game sooner or later.

no picture but heres an idea

Fredegar Bolger

Hobbit

Hero

Start Threat - 7

Willpower- 0

Attack - 0

Defense - 3

Hitpoints - 3

Action - exhaust fredegar bolger and increase your threat by 2 to choose an enemy engaged with you. That enemy does not attack this turn.

 

the idea is that he doesnt want to go on adventures, but is happy to stay and hold the fort as it were- ie in crickhollow.

Very thematic, which I like.   What sphere do you think that would suit?

well spirit is out, and lore isnt very appropraite, nor is leadership, so i guess that leaves tactics? yeah with the action and defense thats about right

It would have to be Tactics. Seems very thematic indeed. I'd love to see Fatty.

 Three new cards for you today.. Was going to make fatty for you rich, but can't find a good picture.

Theyre some great idea abelard- just one suggestion though on the palantir

its seems very powerful for its cost, especially the shadow cards being discarded

raising threat by 3 is really themeatic and i like that, but perhaps add something to show the user going mad? im not sure how it would work…perhaps after everytime you exhaust the palantir the card gains a resource and the amount of resources cannot exceed the amount of willpower of the user.

but then that would limit it to only a handful of uses, so perhaps there could be some way to get rid of them, like the attacthed hero does nothing for a turn to get rid of them

just ideas
