Just a quick query, in the rules for Khazad-Dum one of the quests ("Flight from Moria") has it's Encounter Set symbols and titles listed the wrong way round. I've made an image of what I believe is the correct names for each symbol and posted that below. Is this right?

I had asked if anyone knew if there was going to be an expansion encounter set list like this. I'm hoping that a complete list (with symbols) gets printed soon.

Bumping this old thread because I was just going through the Khazad-Dum deluxe and APs (after getting into Moria for a second time on LOTRO hehe) and I again was looking at icons and thinking "this was never sorted, even in the FAQs".

 

Are the icons right above in the first post? Thanks :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Yes, they seem correct. I recall Foundations of Stone had wrong icons/names, that was addressed in a news article [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=3364] that shows you what these encounter symbols actually are. 

 

Hope this helps  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Thanks spalanzani, that is what I was trying to find. I was sure it had been corrected somewhere but thought it was in the AP rules, have been checking the pdfs online for it. Thanks!

 

Edit: They say on that page that "The misprint will also be addressed in our next The Lord of the Rings FAQ" but I can't remember if they did and if they did they have removed it from the recent FAQs..
