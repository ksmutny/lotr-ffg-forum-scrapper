I have a question about Elfhelm ally [http://ringsdb.com/card/02100] : is text says ''While Elfhelm is ready, he gains:

"Response: After your threat is raised as the result of questing unsuccessfully, or by an encounter or quest card effect, reduce your threat by 1."
 
Because his ability is a response, does it mean that if you quest unsuccessfully by 3 willpower or you get a Doom 3 card, you can activate the ability 3 times and not raise your threat at all or you can just raise your threat by 3 and then reduce it by 1?
 
Thanks!

As I interpret it, you would raise your threat by 2 (instead of 3) for questing unsuccessfully, and also by 2 (instead of 3) if you get a Doom 3 card.

 

So raise threat by 3, then reduce it by 1.

When you raise your threat by some means, the event "your threat has been raised" only occurs once, no matter the size of the threat increase. So the response can only trigger once.

Thankis for your answers! I'm French canadian, so sometimes the wording can be confusing!

If you could do that, you would be able to win the game whenever Legolas defeats an enemy.
