Hi, with parting gift, if you have played song of kings on something, dose this mean you can transfer coins of say a lore native hero, as song of kings adds the leadership icon to the character?

You are correct. The song cards give heroes multiple spheres of influence and they count as both (or more if you have multiple songs).

If you are asking if you can transfer resources from one character to another... no. There is no rule (as far as I know of) right now that allows you to transfer resources between heroes.

 He's asking about the card Parting Gifts, which transfers resources from a Leadership hero to another hero.  And Puzzle's right :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
