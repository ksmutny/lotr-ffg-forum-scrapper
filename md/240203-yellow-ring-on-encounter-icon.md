Why some of the Encounter icon have a golden ring around them and some similar card doesnt have it?

 

Thanks

Those cards are removed when playing on Easy Mode, which also provides an extra resource to start the game with.

Easy mode involves getting extra starting resources and removing some of the harder cards from whichever scenario you are doing.

If you have an early printing of the earlier modules, you need to look up the various adjustments needed for easy mode. (I would use lotr-lcg-quest-companion.com [http://lotr-lcg-quest-companion.com] for this).

In later modules/printings the golden circle was used to allow rapid easy sorting.

And you often get situations with otherwise identical cards where some have it and some not, if the designers merely reduced the number of those cards during easy mode, rather than removing them all.
