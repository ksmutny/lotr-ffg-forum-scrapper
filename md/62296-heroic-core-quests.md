Anyone try to run through the 3 core quests without resetting your game between?

 

Tried it 3 player today.  We beat it.  Wasn't as hard as I thought, mostly because once we got our attachments/allies out it got really easy.  We scored a 270.  Gimili died during the first quest... shameful.  landroval saved dain in quest 3.  But by the time the nazgul came out, we had a big tank ready and 20 some damage, so he just fell over.

 

Maybe next time we'll try Search for Gollum on heroic mode.

Yeah, the original Nightmare rules allow for this sort of scenario. The FAQ has updated rules that are considerably more difficult; essentially, wounds and threat don't reset between quests, but all cards in hand and in play get shuffled back into the player deck. All cards discarded or removed from the game stay in those zones. Quite a bit more challenging, if that's what you're looking for.

We played that wounds, resources and card hands stayed the same.  Basically, once a quest was reset you stood all your characters and started the next quest.

That actually makes it quite easy, since you're already built up ally and attachment wise. But whatever floats your boat!

Actually wasn't going to play it that way again, because it was stupid easy.
