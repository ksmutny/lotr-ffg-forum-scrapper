Same here. We should not let this attack be resolved undefended.

For some time I had listened to those who had been saying it was like this for every game but then I checked the news and the other games are indeed getting something. I stand with the above, we want our news!

We aren't letting it be resolved, we're making our own speculations and news.

I really fail to see the humour in it. Or any signifiance. But perhaps at least you enjoyed it.

This thread= Spot on! I am also ticked that they have jolted the news feed and printing schedule of this game simply because the Hobbit movie is dropping this December. Talk about obvious money making, but hey, I am not against the "spirit of Capitalism" per se, just pissed that the hype has died down from the command center. C'mon FF, start being a little more consistent with this game. 

What keeps me visiting your site frequently is hoping a new write-up on the LOTR LCG will be posted. Alas, too many days have gone by now and I maybe visit your site once every 12 days now. Good job keeping me away! Now, assuming those who descent with me actually read my entire rant here, before you say that I am stupid or whatever, realize that I am only frustrated with FF BECAUSE I am a huge fan of this game and expect consistent updates.

i visit the site multiple times a day still as the game is my primary hobby- but everytime i look at the news and still see 'heirs of numenor' i sigh…..however not all players are as dedicated as those on this thread and regulars…..many will tire if no news is posted

 I have to say I'm kind of miffed as well at the lack of updates, but I also understand that I have been spoiled by Wizards of the Coast and their daily updates on their Magic the Gathering site. We'll just have to be patient, I guess.

I also think they delay to much. But not only news is delayed, quest log is also not update long time. We still dont have SAF there.

at least they remembered to announce the next cycle before they dried up all the news. if they didn't do that i would be convinced that the game was about to be canned.

when the news dries up the forum does a bit to, because there's nothing new to talk about

## 17 [DurinIII on September 12, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/70748-latest-news-23-days-old/?do=findComment&comment=692511)

 Exactly Cunir.

 23 days and counting…

Of course, this is nothing that will change the world dramatically. But neither is 99% (or more) of the internet stuff. So of course, we can just be patient but the lack of news is simply bad for the site. The news makes players excited, speculations spring up, and new fans potentially appear or just stop by more often and contribute to threads like the Tolkien lore. More so, it only takes a few minutes to make up a preview article even though the release may be weeks (or months) off. And a single spoiler card can become a huge issue here. Dead board is a bad board I would say.
