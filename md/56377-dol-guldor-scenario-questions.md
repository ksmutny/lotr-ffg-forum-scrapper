 Hi!  Pretty new to all this.  Had 3 questions on the third scenario in the core set.  1.  When pulling encounter cards during setup, if one or more are not locations or enemies, (ie treachery cards) after resolving the treachery card (if applicable), do you pull another encounter card for that objective or is it left without being attached to an enemy or place?  2.  When you defeat an enemy or explore a location and an objective is detached afterwards, if not claimed, does it go back to staging and just sit there alone, or does another enemy or location take it?  3.  On the Nazgul, when you pull a card for the shadow effect, if it is cancelled or there is no shadow effect, do you still have to disarm a character since technically there has been no shadow effect to resolve?  Thanks!

1. You do not replace the treachery card once it has resolved as a "guard". That objective is now claimable.

2. After the attached location is explored or enemy defeated, the objective card returns to the staging area.

3. The Nazgul card specifically states that "After a shadow effect dealt to Nazgul of Dol Guldur resolves, the engaged player must choose and discard 1 character he controls." If you prevent the shadow effect from resolving by canceling it, you would not trigger the "discard a character".

Hope this helps :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
