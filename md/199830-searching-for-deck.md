# [Searching for deck](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/199830-searching-for-deck/)

Hi!

On one of the CoTR podcasts they mentioned netdecking as a way to improve deck construction skills.  As someone is not that good at deck construction, I thought this might be something to help me out.

When I go to find a netdeck, it seems difficult to find a deck that has the same card pool I have.  

Is there a resource or good way to find decks that have a same (or pretty close) card pool that I have?

 

Thanks so much!

None that I'm aware of. Why don't you pick any deck you like and then just try to substitute the stuff you're missing with similar stuff you possess?

Beorn's Path from the "Hall of Beorn" site was a great resource when I started. He builds a deck from just the Core set and then adds/removes cards as he goes through the expansions. He also explains why he uses/adds/removes certain cards.

Or just post what card pool you do have and how many players you tend to play with.  This type of question gets asked a fair amount on the Cardgamedb page and several users there will help craft a deck.

Generally any 'trait' deck that was introduced in the cycle you own adventure packs to is likely to be available to you. If you have adventure packs from all over the place, it's goingt to be more difficult. If you have packs in order of release, look for decks build a while back when only those packs existed.

Thank you all!  I am going to pursue the sites listed.

I will see what I can do this weekend.  If I am still struggling I will post my pool and ask for specific help. 

Thanks again!!
