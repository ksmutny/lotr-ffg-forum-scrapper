maybe a dumb question but if we drew ungoliant's spawn early in the game and killed him when we reach the quest 3 card where it says to defeat ungoliants spawn to win the game do you automatically win the game or do you have to find and reveal 2 more spiders, Ungoliant's spawn being one and then  fight him all over again????

Yeah, you have to kill him again. At least his when revealed effect won't cause you any problems this time. (Because it isn't just before quest resolution)

i believe im right in saying you only have to pull one card anyways, the game assuming you find and pull the spawn as its required (edit) ignore, thats if you're playing solo
