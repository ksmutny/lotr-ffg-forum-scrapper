 So, the big question. Who gets the +1 attack power? Your character or the enemy? Logically I'd say the character that attacks. BUT it could also be the enemy as a price for getting to do this attack. Any thoughts anyone?

Giving the enemy +1 attack wouldn't have any effect, since the bonus only lasts for the duration of the action (i.e., the enemy would never get to make an attack with the bonus applied). "It" clearly refers to the attacking character, although the wording could have been a bit more straightforward. 

Also, if you want to get really picky, the attacking character is referred to as "it" several times prior to the pronoun in question.

Edit: already answered by starhawk and his interpretation is correct!

 Okay, tanks for clearing that out for me. English my second language and I sometimes miss these to me subtle things that otherwise makes it clear. Working on it to better :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 Just to be sure:

 

You are talking about "Rivendell Bow", right?

 

 

Edit: I've seen the new spoiler for cards on Shadow and Flame
