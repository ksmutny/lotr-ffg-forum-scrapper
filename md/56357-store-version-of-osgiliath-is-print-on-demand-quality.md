A few stores are starting to receive Massing at Osgiliath now, and I'm curious if they're the same quality as those decks ordered through FFGs online store?

Some stores purchased the PoD product and chose to sell it.  However, they are selling the exact same product you can order via PoD.  IT's not just the same quality, its the exact same "thing".

Not necessarily: Some of the foreign publishers (e.g. the German one) have chosen to release the translated version of Osgiliath in standard AP print quality. You're probably right regarding the English version of Osgiliath, though.
