 Why should i exhaust him to give another card 1 quest ability while i can exhaust him to quest (so that i have 2 quest ability)?

 Action: Exhaust Faramir to choose a player. Each character controlled by that player gets +1 Willpower until the end of the phase.

 

It's not just one character, but each character you control.

You can exhaust Faramir to give every character committed to the quest, for one player, +1 willpower. So, if you quest 3 or more characters you should exhaust Faramir to get the most benefit from his ability. Snce Faramir is worth 2 willpower it only makes since to use his ability if 3+ characters are committed to the quest. Remember, his action ability can only apply to one players' characters.

 And you can use his action after all encounter cards are revealed and before quest resolution

 After encounter cards are revealed but before quest resolution, you can exhaust Faramir to use his ability.  Then, you can use Ever Vigilant to ready him, and exhaust him again to use his ability a second time!! (does this sound legal to you? I can't imagine why not…)  So Faramir could boost 2 players or could provide +2 to characters for a single player.

 Then add in a spare hood and cloak for even more fun

Never though about that combo…
