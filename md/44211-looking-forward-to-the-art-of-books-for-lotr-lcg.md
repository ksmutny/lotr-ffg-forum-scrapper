I asked Thaadd Powell(Customer Service) a year or so ago if they would do art books for Lord of the Rings like they have for Lovecraft and A Game of Thrones.  She said that boardgames (Middle-Earth Quest etc.) don't provide enough hi-res art for them to do this.  But the LCGs (A Game of Thrones and Call of Cthulhu) do.

So, now that they have an LOTR LCG I am looking forward to the eventual "Art of..." volumes!

You mean "The Art Of Lord Of The Rings LCG". I think it's to early to talk about it but I like the idea. I would also buy those becouse those arts are amazing.
