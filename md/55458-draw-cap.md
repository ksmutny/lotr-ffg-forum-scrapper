Sorry for the newb question, but I didnt see anything in the Core Rules or FAQ.  I could have missed it though so, is there a draw cap?  Yesterday in our 3-player we had Frodo and Beravor had 2 Unexpected Courage and was readied again by Common Cause and there were 2 Ancient Mathoms in play... can someone really draw like 25+ cards if the mechanics are set up?

You most definitely can. There are quite a few tricks to draw cards. In many games with Beravor, I can routinely draw at least half my deck. Needless to say there is no cap. You can draw your entire deck since there is no deck-out rule. In fact, this has been done before by a few players.

I imagine that at some point, we will probably see a restriction around drawing though. it seems to break the game somewhat :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Yea, that seems a bit OP.  Our group hasn't lost a game since adding me as the third player and I feel like we spend half our time standing Beravor to abuse the draw mechanic.

 How much does it really break the game? Sure drawing lots of cards is handy, but you're still limited by your amount of resources.

Yes this is a weak spot of the game. They should to make some limit of draw per turn or limit the hand size.

It breaks the game a whole lot.  Take a look at Protector of Lorien. 

I still think the problem is Unexpected Courage, rather than Beravor.

I was a bit surprised, when I first read the rules, and found out that there was no deck-out rule. I guess maybe it wasn't considered a big deal when you think of the Will of the West/Dwarven Tomb combo.

I disagree that it "breaks" the game (I hate that phrase). Like someone already said, you're still limited by the amount of resources you have to play the cards, also it takes a long time to set up having Protector of Lorien, plus a million cards in your hand. In addition, there are many quests where having a huge amount of willpower will do you no good ( like having no clue cards in HfG, or like in Carrock, etc.). The chances of all those elements coming together are very slim.

There have been a couple times when Protector of Lorien plus a huge hand of cards has won me the game, but it was after a lot of struggle and I felt like it was a well earned victory, not "Broken"

We can certainly debate the question of "brokeness", and I think you make a strong point on that front, but I strongly disagree that "The chances of all those elements coming together are very slim."  If you have a deck built to take advantage of card draw it happens quite frequently (certainly more often than not).

One several threads from different people I keep hearing that drawing large amounts of cards isn't a big advantage, because of the cost of cards.  I would ask those people, "are you actually playing decks with large amounts of card draw?"  Because my experience with this game is that when I get my card draw engine going, I almost always win.

absolutely. My friend and I both own 3 cores, so we run 6 UCs... it is not even a rare event to be able draw 12 cards a turn JUST on Beravore, and we normally run Bilbo in our "trick" deck as well, and of course there is no shortage of other draw triggers. So many occasions if your in a tough spot we just start drawing, and bang we get an answer. Saying that having a 25 card hand or w/e doesn't make the game a LOT easier to play is rubbish. These card games are all about building a deck that has answers to any given game situation, if you have all the answers in your hand and you only need to play them when needed, it basically means that ANY game situation is able to be beat as you can just select the answer... this imo, this is broken. Like with the no card hand size, some cards make no sense. Like why would we ever need a scrye ability, when you can just draw directly into your hand and hold it, then you can even dump like 10 cards a turn just to pump your questing or defense, add will of the west and you just can not loose. We have had so many situations were we just just pump by dumping say 15 cards, draw 12+ next turn and we have all the same cards again, then will of the west, and get your cards back in your hand the same turn you dump them. So in away, casting doesn't even mean you do not get to use them again you just have any card you want at any time. Or just drawing /WotW, so you have 3 copies of feint in you hand at all time... oh you cast them? Well so what.. you have a 50 card deck, 20+ in your hand, drawing 12+ a turn, so WoTW and in 1 maybe 2 turns you will most likely have all 3 back in your hand. I've played games many a time were the entire engaged army is completely stalled and impotent just by using a tactics splash for feint and quick strike.. These are only 1 mana each.. not hard to control the board when you have like say 2 of each of those cards in your hand at any given point in the game.

 

If there ever is a song or w/e  to add "hobbit" trait ... ... . omg.. waahhhhaaaat?
