I just tried out my latest deck on the introductory scenario. It was pretty easy, even though I drew "Don't Leave The Path" and had to kill Ungolat's Spawn. It was pretty easy. But it got me thinking, and I want to ask:

Which of the two possibilities for the third quest card do you think is easier? "Don't Leave the Path" or "Beorn's Path"?

Generally, I have had more problems with "Don't Leave the Path", but after a spot of deckbuilding, neither path really causes that much trouble anymore.

 I also think that it is easier with any (even STARTER!) deck to beat don't leave the path... you just don't have to look after progress tokens and can take out ungoliant's spawn fairly easily... which prevents other nasty cards from coming out of the encounter deck (imagine the spawn, hummerhorns w/o dunhere, and ufthak, aaah :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png])

At first I thought Don't Leave the Path was an easier option, now with a deck built, I always rather draw Beorn's Path. I rather quest than fight.

Ultimately it depends on the deck:

If it focuses on Tactics, you'll be happy to miss Beorn's path to get to slay the spawn.

If it's built around Lore or Spirit, Beorn's Path will usually be easier.

For Leadership both are equally fine.

 I think it depends rather on your deck.

In the core tactics deck, you'd *far* rather fight the spawn that accumulate 10 progress. In the spirit deck, it's easily the other way around. Lore probably favours the questing too, while with Leadership it's a bit of a toss-up.

I usually end up drawing Beorn's Path followed swiftly by an Ungoliat's Spawn :-)

 I have to say, I have never drawn out Beorn's Path. Every single time I have played the game I have always drawn Don't Leave the Path! I'm starting to get freaked out each time I have to draw it, I think Ungoliant's Spawn has a vendetta out against me.
