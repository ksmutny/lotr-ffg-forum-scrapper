Hey all,

This may have been answered, and if so, please point me to the correct thread (I couldn't find it).

Quick question regarding printed Action abilities on characters and exhausting said characters when committing to a quest, attacking, defending, or any other circumstance that would cause a character to exhaust: do Actions automatically activate if you exhaust a character that requires an exhaust for something else? I'm coming from the only CCG I've ever briefly played, Magic: The Gathering, and I think this was how it worked there. I just want to make sure it isn't how it works in LOTR (otherwise the game just got a whole lot easier).

Thanks!

No, if the character is exhausted by attacking, defending, card effect etc, you do not activate their exhaust ability.  You must choose whether to exhaust them for their ability or not.

And it doesn't work like that for Magic neither. gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]

Thanks guys. Mackey, I most certainly thought that's how it worked in Magic... but I haven't played that or looked at its rules in ages, haha. Guess I'm full of wrong information!

Hahaha, no problem. I play Magic quite often, so I'm sure. happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]

For clarification: when a character is exhausted, you can not use his exhaust ability, however you can use any other ability on the card that does not involve exhausting.  For example, in the introduction video of the game you can see Eowyn get exhausted and then using her ability where you can discard a card from your hand to give her +1 will power.
