# [Anduin vs. new Scoring](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56213-anduin-vs-new-scoring/)

## 1 [marlow4 on November 13, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56213-anduin-vs-new-scoring/?do=findComment&comment=555324)

Anyone beaten Journey Along the Anduin solo since the new scoring change? I'm curious about how it turned out considering the old start with a low threat and slowly pick off the troll and other enemies tactic would probably add some serious points for rounds.

I tried several times tonight with various decks but couldn't manage a single win. Got to stage two a couple times at about Round 14+. At one point I went through two entire games back-to-back without drawing a single ally in decks that were half allies or more. Terrible luck (or terrible shuffling). I'll get back to it tomorrow.

And don't come in here talking about how easy the scenario is. Tired of hearing it. It is composed of some of the worst encounter cards available so far. Anyone who beats it 100% of the time solo with one core set needs to post video evidence with deck lists and well formatted game logs. I'm not buying the open claims of success anymore. Proof or get out. I could sit here all day claiming I'm a surgeon and I just bought my third vacation home. Words don't mean diddly.

Solo Anduin. Let's go. Show me those scores.

I got a 100 with the old Rohan deck ( I thought I'd go easy on myself for the first try with the new scoring system).  Eowyn, Theodred, Dunhere. But that's the easy way with that scenario, I usually try to give myself a challenge by switching up what I'm playing with (it seems like some people just play the Rohan deck every time).

Yeah I've been steering away from Rohan for replays. Use it to knock out a scenario once, then try to mix it up a bit and go with something different. I'm also fond of leaving Gandalf out cause I hate the idea that he's a must have. I don't like must haves.

Had two losses a couple days ago vs. Dead Marshes using decks without a heavy Rohan presence. Both ended at Threat 50, one in 8 rounds and one in 11.

Need to crack this Anduin nut. Might need to go really ally heavy and just try to beat it to death. No finesse. I'm tired of Spirit.

Hi Buddy,

 

I guess some people just redraw till they got the perfect starting hand and don't call it loosing. Other than that, I don't see 100% happening, ever.

Once the troll is ensnared, it's pretty much close to certain victory. The problem is, every time he swings at an hero he can potentially outright lose you the game (shadow: ignore armor or +1 damage).
 

I'm doing this with Lore / Leadership (Bilbo, guy who puts 1$  on a questing hero, guy who gets 1$ per damage on him). The starting thread is low so I've got some time to get an forrest trap. Also I'm drawing a ton cards which helps getting it faster. Like I said, when you manage to ensnare him the rest is a cakewalk. Before that though you can pretty much lose quite fast and unexpected by some unlucky shadow cards. My best score is 149, havnt tried to improve it yet.

I have only started to play Rohan deck recently, and just because of the theme. And it works well, yes, the best way solo right now, probably, at least most of the quests, not Rhosgobel, for instance.

I do run 2 other deck frequently or at the same time when playing coop.

Using a spirit/lore deck (Eowyn, Dunhere, Bilbo, using HfG + CatC) I managed to win 50 percent of my games. The score ranged from 133 to 199. Before that I played  tactics-lore deck (Gimli, Legolas, Bilbo) which had some problems with this scenario (do not put a dwarf, an elf and a hobbit on a boat! lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif]), but rocked against HfG and CatC.

 

I think I used another spirit/lore deck when I played JdtA first when I only had the core set. Eleanor, Dunhere and Beravor with a starting threat of 25 allowed me to win about 80 percent of the games.

80% wins doesn't do anything for me just like 9% unemployment rate in the US doesn't do anything to solve the economic troubles (it's much higher than 9%). There's more to the story, and I want the more. I've played with that hero combo, I've played with just about every hero combo at this point. It gets to the point where nothing is happening except my threat is going up and up and up. I only own five threat reducers, the two Greetings and 3x Gandalf who I don't even include in every deck because he's an attention &^%$#. There are many games where I don't draw any of those five threat reducers out of a 50 card deck. I rarely get through half my deck even with Beravor doing nothing but drawing. Anduin drives the pain train at you from round one. There's no time to dilly dally and build up the perfect hand and perfect wall of allies that some people seem to describe. It would take a miracle series of draws and about 20 rounds. I don't buy it.

Score range of 133-199 is the kind of info I'm looking for. I think scenarios like Anduin are going to finish with considerably higher scores on average than some other scenarios, scenarios people have claimed to beat in round 3.

We must endeavor to break the barrier and score the lowest score ever for Anduin (after the scoring change) and provide deck details other than which heroes we used. It's a moral imperative.

Next up for me is a possible quad sphere deck using the songs and Boromir, Imrahil, and Denethor. High starting threat but if I can get out a cheap blocker for the troll I think they can tag team him. The cheap blocker would be exiting, standing Imrahil. High starting threat will be going higher though with Boromir. I might have to call Gandalf's agent and arrange a public appearance. The songs are necessary when no hero is present for a resource match but they take up valuable deck space. I might grab as many allies of cost 2 or lower that can fit but I feel dirty using Rohan characters as I already know Rohan is strong like bull.

Back to the command center! Lower scores!

 Sometimes when I finish a game with the new scoring system I feel like i'm not very good at the game anymore cause my score is so much higher than before, it's kind of depressing.  I haven't tried Anduin with the new scoring system but I am sure that my score will be high and I will once again feel like I suck.  Oh well

Do you only own the coreset or some of the expansions, too? Because scoring the lowest score ever without knowing your opportunities doesn't do anything for me just like knowing that some Hobbit has my ring... but these little bastards all look the same. gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]

 

Btw, IMHO "3x Gandalf who I don't even include in every deck because he's §%§/&§ " is not compatible with "score the lowest score ever for Anduin". At all. And what do you mean with "only fvie threat reducers"? In more than 75 percent of your games you should have one of them in your starting hand!

 

So, what can I say to help you? Well, I might not be a genius, but I think it's safe to assume that Protector of Lorien in combination with Beravor or Bilbo should be essential to get a good score in this scenario. And use Gandalf (if he's in your deck, that is) to hit the troll, thread reduction is not as essential as it had been (I wonder if it would be even ok to play this scenario without Greeting of the Galadrim).

## 12 [marlow4 on November 13, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56213-anduin-vs-new-scoring/?do=findComment&comment=555503)

I own all released adventure packs and 1 core set. It doesn't matter what I own, I'm challenging everyone to take on Anduin after the scoring change. So get to work.

I don't want to see "you should be drawing this 75% of the time in your opening hand." It never works that way. Ever. I've been playing card games for too long at this point to rely on figures. Think practically and realistically instead of crunching numbers.

Is Gandalf truly needed for the lowest possible score? That is a valid point you bring up. Let's build decks and find out.

Less theory, more scoring. Onward, comrade citizens!

I want us to score below 100. That's our target right now. If it can be done without Gandalf and Galadhrim's Greetings, awesome. Say with a generous final threat of or near 40, that would be 5 rounds. Can Anduin be successfully completed in 5 rounds? If no, then a lower threat must be established or more victory points. Going to get at least the VP from the first Troll.

A toast, with my orange soda, to strong starts and no dead heroes.

I've only been playing since the scoring changed, but I've been playing a lot since I started. I play mostly solo, and I only have one Core Set.

That said, the best score I've managed against Journey Down the Anduin is 121, and that was with Éowyn, Glóin, and Gimli.

My second best score was 130 with Éowyn, Denethor, and Glorfindel.

My third best score was 141 with Aragorn, Théodred, and Legolas.

## 14 [Glaurung on November 14, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56213-anduin-vs-new-scoring/?do=findComment&comment=555593)

My scoring is 193. Is not so good actually. But with deck i dont think it can be better. Maybe the best is 140 or something. Yes you can make a deck against certain quest and try to get best scores.... If this will be tournament system i pass.

Good stuff. You're doing better than I am. I played over a dozen games tonight at least and lost every. single. one. Badly.

I was determined to get a Tactics/Lore deck to do it, without any Spirit, without Gandalf. Couldn't do it. Even with my  main man Gimli who can actually take a full hit from the Troll and survive. Tinkered, adjusted, tried again. Tinkered, adjusted, tried again. I managed to draw Forest Snare once and that was in a game where I decked myself and lost due to a slow threat death. I need resource generation.

So I gave in and went back to Leadership/Spirit. Lost again.

Gave up even further and went to Emyn Muil to try and salvage some dignity. Ended up with a final score of 199. Brutal. Nothing I could do about it, I had to wait for victory point locations to actually hit the table.

I know what I have to do to beat Anduin. I've beaten it. I don't want to do it. I want to find another route. So far it hasn't happened.

Back to the drawing board!

## 16 [leptokurt on November 14, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56213-anduin-vs-new-scoring/?do=findComment&comment=555617)

I just played it with my new combo of Dunhere, Frodo and Bilbo. Results were 126, 187 and 115.

 

In the last game I had a few lucky draws from the encounter deck. I started against Gladden Fields and the Hill Troll, but I had Henemarth Riversong right from the beginning. I used his action every round, which helped a lot because the first two cards from the encounter deck were Pursued by Shadows. By round 3 my threat was at 29, but I could use Galadrim's Greeting to bring it down to 23. In the meanwhile I had played Eomund as an ally and Burning Brand on Bilbo.

The encounter deck then spilled out the Goblin Snipers who were immediatly killed by Dunhere.

In round 4 I got Treacherous Fog (yeah!) and made some more progress in the quest. Dunhere sang the Song of Wisdom.

In round 5 the Beastmaster of Dol Guldur approached who didn't care about my party but was attacked by Dunhere nonetheless (2 damage).

During round 6 I had to cross another Treacherous Fog, and afterwards the Beast Master was killed by Dunhere. I was able to play Rivendell Mistress before and thus got Song of Kings. I put it on Frodo who immediatly named himself Steward of Gondor, got a Favour by the Lady and gave a Dunedain Mark to Dunhere.

In round 7 a band of Misty Hill Goblins attacked my party, but they were deflected by the mighty Bilbo and killed by Dunhere and Eomund.

Round 8 saw the battle against the Hill Troll. Gandalf himself damaged the troll badly before the fight even started. He absorbed the troll's attack while my remaining party, now supported by a Northern Tracker, slaughtered the poor troll. Henemarth was killed and Eomund wounded by The Necromancer's Reach which proofed that questing is sometimes more dangerous than fighting trolls.

Round 9 again delivered my a lucky draw from the encounter deck: Banks of the Anduin and Evil Storm. I played Longbeard Mapmaker. Gandalf and Faramir joined my party using a Sneak Attack. Farmir performed his awesome action and supported the questing crew which consisted of Frodo (4 WP), Northern Tracker (2), the Mapmaker (2), Eomund (3), the Mistress (3) and Gandalf (5).

I immediatly travelled to stage 3B and was confronted with some Wargs and the Necromancer's Path. Dunhere and Bilbo didn't give a **** about the latter. They both decided not to defend against the Wargs so Frodo used his powers to absorb the three points damage. The Wargs tried to flee (no shadow effect), but Dunhere got them just when they felt they were safe.

 

My final threat level was at 32, plus 90 points minus 7 points for the Hill Troll and the Gladden Fields = 115 points.

 

I really had a good time with the encounter deck in this game. Six (!) treachery cards, all of them doing me little to none harm, three locations of which only the Gladden Fields were a threat and only four enemies of which I could kill two before they could attack me. Getting 2x Sneak Attack to use the Faramir/Gandalf combo was the cherry on the cake, of course.

Of course the encounter deck took revenge immediately. demonio.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/demonio.gif]

 

Starting card: Enchanted Stream

1st encounter: Wolf Rider + Brown Lands

I have no allies, I have nothing to cancel the threat of Brown Lands, my threat rises to 30. In the second round I draw the Marsh Adder which seals the deal.

## 18 [LEGA on November 14, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56213-anduin-vs-new-scoring/?do=findComment&comment=555632)

I haven't played Journey at solo only 2 players games.

Last weekend we played it few times. We played 1-Glorfindel, Beravor and Theodred; 2-Legolas, Eowyn and Dunhere. First 4 games we were defeated at the middle of 2b stage with no chances. There were a lot of enemies: both trolls, marsh, chieftan and others. And our draw was very unsuccessful. But next day we played same decks and defeated this quest with 140 points! We had neither dead nor even wounded heroes. We had 68 total threat, 18 victory in 9 rounds. But I should admit that we had just amazing draw. Again lot of enemies but excellent draw: 3 forest snares (for both trolls and marsh). At the end of game I had threat 48 (2 Trolls by 5 threat each), 2 Sneak attacks, no one Gandalf in game but lots of cards (Beravor + Gleowyn). And then I draw Gandalf, -10 threat during round, and in last round I again bought Gandalf; healed every heros with Glorfingel, Daughter of the Nimrodel and Self Preservation on Beravor and defeated it. It was very lucky draw!

But the easier variant for this quest for 2 players game is simple Core Tactics+Spirit. 1 player Tactics and second is Spirit. We defeated this quest with such deck mostly every time we tried (maybe 1-2 loses in 10+ games).

That might be the best we can hope for. Below 100 might require more luck than the Encounter deck will allow. I'm going to keep trying. This is my way of retiring the Core scenarios before Khazad Dum hits.

I'm toying with an idea to try and take on and kill the Troll by Round 2 but I don't know if I'm dreaming. Building up before dealing with him adds to the number of rounds but starting with strong heroes that might be able to handle him adds to Threat. I think adding to the starting Threat may be better than adding unnecessary rounds at 10 points a pop. But then I'll have to use G. Greetings and Gandalf to recover. Maybe.

I have to say... this new scoring system is making people actually discuss scores and ways to lower them. That's already a plus for me I think.

## 21 [guciomir on November 14, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56213-anduin-vs-new-scoring/?do=findComment&comment=555868)

And what is more, people are encouraged to play more aggresively, which sometimes can turn out pretty badly.

Do you imagine (old scoring) anyone who would rush to meet the troll? Most people were delaying this for hours and the quest was not giving much fun. But now, when delaying is not a valid strategy, Anduin suddenly become very interesting and harder.

I wasn't a fan of stalling for glory even before the scoring change. I like to defeat my opponents by breaking their fists with my face.

And like the temperature outside, I'm no fan of triple digits. 99 on solo Anduin or bust.

Make it so, Number One.

Well, my face is sore...

I just took my first attempt(s) with a Rohan deck (Éowyn, Théodred, Dúnhere - 1 core set only) against Journey Down the Anduin.

The first 4 games were a bust in one way or another. Determination set in.

I finally won it with a final score of 193. (Final Threat of 40, Turn 16, +Damage, -Victory Points)

And those victory points included 2 Hill Trolls and a Marsh Adder. Yikes!

Conclusions: The Rohan trio must have their place somewhere, but I think it may not be on the shores of the Anduin with only one Core Set to deck build.

Is it sick that I kind of want to try again now though...? sorpresa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sorpresa.gif]

## 25 [Glaurung on November 15, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56213-anduin-vs-new-scoring/?do=findComment&comment=556034)

Actually some people have 1 core sets. Some people have 2 core sets. Some people have 3 core sets. So i have 2 core set. So it means i have always better chance against the people who have 1 core set right???? So this scores not really fair.

If my deck have 3 northern tracker and 2 Dwarven tomb(2 core set) i have better chance to win anyway. So here is also some tricks about what kind of format we play for now. Sure with 1 core set game more interesting and hard but with 2 or 3 core set more chance to win and get better scores right???

You made a good point here. Of course it's easier to win if you have 3 copies of powerhouses like Steward of Gondor or Unexpected Courage.

 

 

As for the scenario, I have completed 15 games so far. After my earlier successes I lost quite a lot of games recently. I still managed to win 7 out of 15 games with my hobbit heroes. I think if I'd replace Frodo with Eowyn my results would get better, but then it's more challenging and thus more fun to use the little sad hobbit instead. Scorewise I'm not too bad, got a 122 and a 133, but then I loose more often than I win. Appears that my deck is very vulnerable at the beginning of the game, as it is not able to handle too many enemies.

 

For anyone who wants to try, here is my deck (using 1 coreset, HfG + CatC expansion):

 

Note: the deck is designed to compete against all quests. It's thus not perfect to play against JdtA.

 

Heroes:

 

Dunhere (8), Frodo (7), Bilbo (9) = 24 starting threat

 

Allies:

 

Gandalf x 3

 

Faramir x 1

Snowborn Scout x 1

 

Northern Tracker x 2

Eomund x 2

Wandering Took x 2

Westfold Horse-Breaker x 1

 

Rivendell Minstrell x 2

Daughter of the Nimrodel x 2

Longbeard Mapmaker x 1

Erebor Hammersmith x 1

Miner of the Iron Hills x 1

Henamarth Riversong x 1

 

Attachments:

 

Song of Kings x 2

Song of Wisdom x 1

 

Steward of Gondor x 2

Dundedain Mark x 3

Dundedain Warning x 2

 

The Favour of the Lady x 2

Unexpected Courage x 1

 

Forest Snare x 2

Burning Brand x 2

Protector of Lorien x 1

 

Events:

 

Sneak Attack x 2

 

The Galadhrims' Greeting x 2

Strength of  Will x 2

Dwarven Tomb x 1

 

Striker's Path x 3

Secret Paths x 2

Glauring, I've got a well-meant hint for you: Ending a sentence with a single question mark is sufficient to indicate it is supposed to be a question.

Likewise, a single exclamation mark is usually sufficient to express your excitement aboutsomething or stress a point..

As it is it distracts from the point you are trying to make and is similarly annoying as writing everything in uppercase.

 

Consider:

Lolwut????? Wot about pro-players who have all teh cardz??????? The new scoring sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!1111

vs.

I wonder if FFG has considered the effect of having multiple core sets on the final score? I believe the new scoring system is still in need of improvement!

As English is not his native language, you shouldn't expect an uber elaborated text. Furthermore, Russian language is not as elaborative as is English. It's more expressive and straight to the point. To Westerners it often sounds a bit rude, especially when written, but really it isn't. It's just different. And they use LOTS of exclamation marks when they speak. gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]

Howdy folks,

 

Inspired by the discussion I just played Anduin 3 times in a row and Im quite excited about it. I could not breach the 100 score mark, but Im convinced that 100 is well within reach and I dont even considers something like a sub-90 impossible. Let me lay out what just happend.

 

Please excuse me for not providing you with a deck list at this point. I got german cards and looking each of them up is a chore. I will however provide a full deck list if you got any honest interest in it.

 

First of all, Im playing Gloin, Theodred and Bilbo (26 starting thread), using 1 core set and all expansions up until the fourth of the first cycle. Fielding a very nimble setup Im very reliant on getting tons of money with Gloin (letting him take damage each turn and healing with self preservation) and Theodreds questing abilty. This money can always be dumped quite easily since we draw a lot of cards with Bilbo, draw 2 for 3$ and the tap-to draw elf. Im using all the new enchantments for +1 attack, +1 armor and +2 willpower to compensate  for weak starting heroes.

The first game was a very standard one, very similar to my first experience with the quest (149 score). Prepare for the troll (4 turns left), put him in a trap and proceed slowly from there. This game turned out slightly better with a score of 142.

Second game I pulled the 3 thread from location, 2 surge crows and than +1 thread for each hero not commited to a quest DURING SETUP, leaving me with tons of stuff to deal with before the first turn AND only 1 turn left until troll pull. I conceded this game after setup and called it a loss.

The third game however was very interesting. It started off very promising- setup only gave me the 10thread / 2 damage ork. This guy would basically give me 2 risk-free extra resources each turn (if he remains unblocked he can put at max 3 damage on Gloin which I can mitigate with SP). I also had Steward of Gondor on my starting hand and got Celebrians Stone on my first 2 cards. During the first 4 turns until I had to worry about the Troll, both decks were very kind.

In turn 5 the first major deviation on the way to a quick victory occurs. Instead of eating a hefty troll blow on a chump blocker for a ton of thread, trapping him and proceeding slowly from there, I manage to kill him right away AND clear step 1 in a single turn. This is basically how its done:

The main phase delivers Gandalf, who puts damage on the troll. Then I clear the quests 8 points (+location) by commiting everything but gandalf to questing. (Thanks to Faramir Ive got enough willpower to do that). Gandalf proceeds to block the Troll (I think I did a mistake there. I remember dealing me 2 thread after the trolls swing vs Gandalf, forgetting that Gandalf HPs would prevent the ogers trample-thread from occoring. Im not sure though so Id rather keep the 2 thread on my final score). Then I play ready everything for 5 (only 1 copy in deck!). Yes, the combo costs 10. Only doable with Gloin, Theodrid and Steward I assume. With everything beeing able to attack again and the 4 gandalf-direct-damage on the troll I can sweap the board (think I had a crow left or so) AND proceed to stage 2 in one turn at the end of turn 5.  At this point Im allready like "Omg, I just might do cut 100!"

The upcoming 6th turn made conviced me even more that I could do it. since Im basically able to clear it in 1 turn. With 2 copies of ready target ally on hand I can use Faramir 3 times, giving everyone a ricicoules +3 Spirit. At this point I have to kill 1 tiny creature AND turn over 2 treachery / locations in order to f innish with 60 from turn, 33-ish from thread, 4 from damage (1 in Bilbo...)  and -7 from VP. I might just end up at 90 if everything goes well! Jeezzz!

But instead everything goes to ****. I pull the surge-crow, the fat snake-thing with 7 life and the 1 damage on each exhausted ally treachery. The treachery almost wipes my ally board (Faramir survices) clean. Bilbo (with 2$ on him) goes to hell, not only giving me a crushing -9VP, but also leaving me behind with only 2 heroes, quick strike, Faramir (allready in play) and a bunch of now useless Lore-cards on hand.

The treachery + snake ruin my day so badly its not even funny. My heroes have no +attack from items, so I got 6 attack power total on the board. I need to kill a crow and the 7 life / 1 armor snake. I cannot take a single snake-blow unblocked, leaving me only at 4 effective attack power. Until I clear the board I got nothing to improve my hand, only drawing lore stuff. On turn 9 I finally remember that I can give the +1 def attachment on Faramir to a hero so that he actually dies from a snake-hit. Only this way I can Im able to get a second Faramir with Quick Strike out for a final missing damage point.

So with instead of 90 points on a good final draw I end up with a freaking 132.

On the one hand, I seemed to have very good draws from the encouter deck. On the other hand though I was using a deck that was far from beeing maxed out on potential due to severe card limitations. If I sum it up I come to the conclusion that (If people keep trying) the 100 is a very reasonable number for a good game. Also I can only encourage players to challenge the quest in such a "competitive" way, its really great fun.

Sorry again for not qouting card names every time. **** german cards. Let me know though if you want to recreate and test this deck, I will happily put the effort into it.

Thanks for the detailed write up, UK. Good stuff. Interesting choice of heroes. Keep trying, break that 100 barrier. I'm going to take several more tries tonight. The first time I ever beat the scenario I used a Whatever Works 4 Sphere deck back when the 2nd Adventure back was released. So I think with all 4 Song cards out now I might be able to modify it to make it tighter.

 

## 31 [marlow4 on November 16, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56213-anduin-vs-new-scoring/?do=findComment&comment=556433)

Lowest score I managed with my Quad Sphere deck tonight was 121. Once it got going it was smooth as silk, burned through the second stage in 2 rounds with Willpower overkill. But it takes too long to get to that point, I was in round 8 or 9 before getting to stage 2. That's no good for breaking 100.

I'll try it a few more times before I try using Gimli instead of Dunhere or something to get more aggressive with the Troll. Dunhere is great for sniping but if I can consistently burn through that second stage I won't need much sniping. I'm actually having trouble fitting all the cards I want in a nice tidy 50-card deck now, couldn't say that a couple adventure packs ago.

Well done, UnthoughtKnown! I wouldn't recommend your "let the orcs attack undefended" strategy though. as there are four shadow cards in this deck that will kill one of your heroes (+ 2 ATK and + 3 ATK) if they trigger undefended and one shadow effect forces you to discard all your attachments. It's pretty risky, but if your goal is the best score possible instead of having a good win/loss ratio, it's of course ok to do so.

 

Back to the game: I just managed a 113 score, but don't ask me about details. I had the songs of wisdom and kings very early, and Steward of Gondor, too. I could thus play many cards and was also lucky to get 3x Dundedain Mark relatively early. The troll was dead by round 8, afterwards I got Unexpected Courage. I lacked Protector of Lorien and Faramir though, so it took me three turns to gte through stage 2B. 3B was a walk in the park as I revealed no more enemies. The result is however flawed and unofficial, because halfway through the game I saw that I had shuffled one of the two trolls into my deck. preocupado.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/preocupado.gif]

 

Score: 11 rounds + 18 threat + 2 damage -17 VP = 113

 

I have one more question. In one turn I played Gandalf and committed him to the quest. In the combat phase I got dealt "Driven by Shadow" as a shadow effect. It says that I have to take one of my exhausted allies back on my hand. I chose Gandalf (hehe). I think it's ok to do so, but somehow it feels weird that one gets a huge bonus by dealing a shadow effect. sorpresa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sorpresa.gif]

It's forbidden, any advantage for player is forbidden, cause game's too easy (Glaurung-rule!)

 

No, in fact it's allowed, though this card is probably not intended too bring any advantage to the players, in some situations it does...

First name of this card Pursued by shadow.

Second advantage is only work for now with Gandalf and if he defend against some cool enemies take hi in hand can be also bad cose attack will be undefended. But still sometimes you can get Gandalf back in hand by this card.

Lol, looks l made the wrong German/English translation. Hmmh, perhaps because Gandalf was driven by shadow back to my hand?

And no, Gandalf wasn't defending, he was out questing. And then he was suddenly back home.

Try getting Driven by Shadow as Shadow card for the Hill Troll when you're defending against it with Gandalf as your only exhausted ally... llorando.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/llorando.gif] . Turned a solid block into an undefended attack, killing off a Hero turn 1, basically spelling doom right away.

My best score is 111, achieved twice:

1. with Eowyn, Dunhere, Theodred

2. with Beravor, Bilbo, Gloin

I do have three core sets which I am sure makes a significant difference, as others have noted.

I think the main difference is that you have a better chance to get certain cards. Would be nice to have Unexpected Courage 3 times, of course.

That's exactly what happened to me and my girlfriend two days ago. She was excited to kill the troll on the first turn... until the blocking Gandalf was returned to her hand. Interestingly, we decided to kill off Eowyn, as that was the only way to still kill the troll on that turn. We actually managed to win, but it was a lot of hard work.

So what do you do when you pull a Hill Troll off the encounter deck.  I had that happen to me last night.  I ruled that I would have to go and get the other Hill Troll and add it to the staging area.  Safe to say I got smoked very early.  I am just wondering how do the rest of you rule that when it happens?

You mean during setup? If you flip a Hill Troll you are lucky, you do not need to go search for another Hill Troll. The quest specifically says "(if one is not already in play)".

I hadn't scored my quests for a while, even after the release of the new scoring system, but was inspired by this thread to go back to Journey Down the Anduin and see what I could do. I haven't broken 100 yet, but it's definitely feasible.

I played four games recently and was surprised to lose the first after a set up that put 3 enemies into the staging area before anything started. With 5 enemies attacking on turn 2, Frodo could only deflect so much, and I hit 50 threat on turn 3. After that, I scored 115 in the second game and was on pace to win the third game, but not in less than 10 turns, putting my projected score well over 130 even after it was time for bed. I called that one a wash, but on the 4th game, I had some better draws and got a score of 101.

Heroes: Aragorn, Beravor, and Frodo.

Turn 7 win, 37 threat, 1 wound (Frodo), 7 victory points (Gladden Fields, Hill Troll).

My opening hand included Protector of Lorien, Sneak Attack, Snowbourn Scout, and Unexpected Courage. Setup yielded The Necromancer's Reach to no effect, and on the first turn, I drew into Steward of Gondor and Gandalf (since Beravor *always* draws, my draw is 3 a turn, or better). On the 2nd turn, Gandalf and Aragorn put 8 wounds on the Hill Troll after Aragorn defended with Protector of Lorien and Unexpected Courage, and Gandalf finished it off on turn 3. Recurring Snowbourn Scouts took the hits from other enemies along the way while Aragorn got Celebrian's Stone and Steward of Gondor to quest and attack each turn. By the end of the game, he had two Dunedain Marks.

On turn 7, I completed the 2nd stage, and revealed 2 locations, so I only had a single Wargs in the staging area. I drew the shadow card and talked to it for a second, telling it to have a shadow effect, and it yielded a +1 ATTK for a decisive kill on the Snowbourn Scout. Aragorn wiped out the Wargs, and that was it. So 101 was a lucky score, but I could easily have scored lower with the same encounter draws had I drawn a second copy of Gandalf to Sneak Attack in for some late-game threat reduction.

Deck:

Aragorn, Beravor, Frodo

Gandalf x3

Radagast

Faramir

Snowbourn Scout x3

Sneak Attack x3

Celebrian's Stone x3

Steward of Gondor x3

Dunedain Mark x3

Lore of Imladris x3

Gleowine x2

Miner of the Iron Hills x3

Protector of Lorien x3

Haldir of Lorien

Gildor Inglorion

Henamarth Riversong

Will of the West x2

Northern Tracker x2

Unexpected Courage x3

Stand and Fight x3

A Test of Will x3

Hasty Stroke x3

For what it's worth, the deck has beaten all of the Core Set and Shadows of Mirkwood scenarios released, except for Escape from Dol Guldur. Some of the cards prove more useful against some scenarios than others. Haldir's probably the least useful card in the deck. Gildor carries his weight when he starts questing or when deck manipulation is vital.

Also got a 101 in my last game.

I used the restrictions that Juicebox had in mind for his tournament - 1 coreset, no AP's.

 

My heroes were Theodred, Gloin and Thalin. Starting threat = 26

 

My starting had Gandalf, Brok Ironfist and Faramir assembled, whcih is great when you have a resource driven deck. Feint is always great to havw when fighting the troll. I also had a Gondorian Spearman and the Gonolian Blade.

During the setup I was lucky as I drew "Despair", so I had only to start with the hill troll in the staging area.

 

The first round is a blessed one, as I get Beorn on my hand and "Evil Storm" in the staging area. I send all my heroes to the quest and give Thalin the additional resource. Threat  = 27

In the second round I get the Dwarfen Axe Warrior and play Faramir. I send everone but Gloin questing again. The encounter deck reveals "Despair" again. Thalin gets the extra resource. Threat = 28

Third round: My draw is Lonbeard Orc Slayer. I play no cardsEveryone but Gloin sets out for the adventure. My group has to face the Dol Guldur orcs who get one damage by Thalin's ability and who damage Thalin in revenge with 2 points.. Thalin again gets an extra resource. Then I decide to let the attack through undefended (risky, I know). Eastern Crows is the shadow card, and Gloin gets 3 damage and thus also 3 resources. Angrily he kills the Orcs with a single blow. Threat = 29

By round 4 I have enough resources to play my mighty allies Brok and Beorn. I draw Sneak Attack which allows me to play Gandalf and to engange and kill the troll in this round. My new card is Dwarfen Axe. Threat = 29

The troll is dead, but I still need some points to complete stage 1. Evil Storm enters the staging area, and leaves without hurting anyone. Threat = 30

Round 6: welcome to stage 2. I draw Ever Vigilante and play Gandalf, the Spearman and an Axe Warrior. Everyone quests, only the Spearman is guarding the rear. He faces pursued by Shadows and another group of DG Orcs and dies defending. The good news is that i get through stage 2 in one turn. I enter stage 3 and reveal Necromancer's Pass and the Beastmaster of Dol Guldur. The beastmatser stays in the taging area until next round. Threat = 27 (Gandalf lowered it by 5)

7th and final round: I play another Spearman that I got at the beginning of this round and send Famir and Thalin questing. The DG Orcs die as they attack the Speaman, Beorn defends against the Beatsmaster and gets readied by Ever Vigilante: the Beatmaster is killed and I win.

 

Result: 28 threat + 7 damage + 7 turns - 4 VP = 101

I'm not restricting myself to just the core set and no APs. I applaud those trying it that way but I need to kill this scenario before KD hits shelves.

Over the last couple days I've tried a more aggressive tactic and tried various combinations of spheres and heroes. Was able to consistently kill the Hill Troll on round 2 using the three Dwarves (Gloin, Gimli, Thalin) but after that I just couldn't get the questing power needed to make it through before hitting 50 threat.

I went back to Tactics/Lore again, but same results as before. Fail after fail. I just can't seem to draw either of my two copies of Forest Snare.

Have a new Tactics/Spirit deck set up ready to go and I'll try that later. I want to ultimately defeat it without Spirit though. When I win with Spirit I feel like it was an empty victory. A tainted victory. A victory with an asterix next to it. You get my drift.
