Hi,

Question regarding to the refresh action:

Example: Starting threat level 26

it means that the threat level can be reduced in 12 points or that it needs to be reduced to the original starting threat level 26?

Thanks

Lore Aragorn's ability will reduce your threat to whatever your starting threat level was, so if all three of your heroes combined had 26 total threat, Aragorn will reduce your threat to 26.
