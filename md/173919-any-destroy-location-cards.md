Hi all, the reason I ask about this is.........

 

How many solo games have you played and pulled location after location cards and got really miffed!!!!! Lol.

 

I know it's all down to luck, but... boy does it get miffing when you pull that 3rd location in a row!!!!

 

All the best.

Whip out those cards that place progress tokens on locations while they are still in the staging area.  There's only one that does this in the core set.

 

Cards that are now, or will be, your friends:  Northern Tracker [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Northern-Tracker-Core] in the good ol' core set, and in other expansions or adventure packs: Asfaloth [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Asfaloth-FoS], Ride to Ruin [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Ride-to-Ruin-THoEM], Greyflood Wanderer [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Greyflood-Wanderer-TTT], and several others. 

 

I do not believe there is at present any card that simply discards a location.

GrandSpleen is right. Most location control is in the form of placing progress.

 

The card Short Cut from The Watcher in the Water AP lets you shuffle a just revealed location back into the encounter deck, but you have to reveal a new card and exhaust a hobbit to play it.

 

Other options are encounter deck manipulation effects like Denethor that are generally in Lore and can be used for more than just location control.

 

In Spirit there is the Celduin Traveler ally that lets you look at the top encounter card and discard it if it is a location.

Thanks for the information, it seems to me that putting multiple locations in the staging area is the only problem I have with this game.

I think it's a bit too late now for FFG to change any rules, but someone should have brought this up.

The enjoyment of the game goes when you pull four locations in a row, and then..... Another one gets pulled.

Perhaps a Map card that allows you to trash a location if you have three + locations out. Then maybe the balance would work with solo games.

Just a thought, perhaps others would like to add their ideas.

All the best.

locations mostly lake intrest for me.  Maybe this is because I only own up to the dwarrowdelf and all saga (except the latest 2).  I hear new ones from ring maker and such are beasts.  in shadows of mirkwood, you can just quest a lot and be ok.  another thing is that I always include at least 2 northern trackers if I have spirit. ALWAYS.  the one memory I have of location lockige is Amen muil.  you might all say:"HAHA, he lost to AM!" but I decided to try it with a non-questing deck and got crushed.
