Shameless self promotion here wink.gif [https://cf.geekdo-static.com/images/wink.gif]

I began playing LOTR shortly after the release of Khazad-Dum, and quickly began getting addicted. I’ve always enjoyed reading other LOTR blogs and forums, but my desire to share my own content and adventures has recently grown so much that I wanted to create a blog of my own. I hope it will eventually become a place of useful and fun resources for the community to use, as well as a place for discussion about the game.

Please come and check it out if you feel like it :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
