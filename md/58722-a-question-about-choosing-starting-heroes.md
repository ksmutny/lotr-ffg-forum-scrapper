 Just a quick question I had. What happens to the heroes I don't decide to start with. Lets say I choose one hero to start with. What happens to the other two? Do they go into the player deck? Your starting hand? Or are they set aside?

It's good idea to choose 3 heroes for an adventure. If you choose less, other heroes returned to the box, and you have less starting threat but (in long run) less resources and abilities.

the standard amount is 3 heros....the others dont interact with the game just as your cards that arent in your deck dont interact with the game....i wouldnt recommend have less than 3, and the rules state you cant have more than that

 You never have your Heroes in your hand or your deck. 

 

Your selected Hero cards are their own thing, and unless one gets destroyed (by taking damage or a card effect) they always remain in your play area.
