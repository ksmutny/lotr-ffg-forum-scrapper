In case I have missed something, has any closer sign of the release been released? I'm trying to make them richer (and I'm sure I'm not the only one) but they still neglect my strife, probably knowing just all too well they'll get richer anyway.

And howabout some more preview cards in a printable quality? That'd be nice for a start.

The place whose dates I usually go by has changed it now to June 30. It hasn't changed Emyn Muil yet, so I'll keep an eye on it. As for FFG, they still have it "on the boat."

## 3 [lleimmoen on June 13, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/48309-release-date/?do=findComment&comment=484619)

Thanks. Hope the slow heavy boat is not going to sink.

Yes, we are talking just that. Hope the info is right and not very local.

Hello again. So I guess Wednesday did not work, eh? Any news though from the retailer?

out of interest- what country are you guys in? - I'm guessing whatever the UK release date is, it'll be at least a few weeks behind the rest of the world.

## 9 [Spirit Juggler on June 16, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/48309-release-date/?do=findComment&comment=486158)

I'm in the UK Jim. It's usually about the same to be honest.

 I am living in Sweden, and surprisingly my The Hunt for Gollum adventure pack has arrived today. Actually, even my retailer was surprised that he got some packs already now.

## 11 [Doom1502 on June 16, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/48309-release-date/?do=findComment&comment=486190)

Omg, you're lucky.

The german publisher moved the release date frome june 11 to july 11 :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

I'm from, and currently again living in, the Czech Republic. The retailers here are usually pretty confused so I cannot tell much about its release date as of yet.

Fair enough- just basing it on my experience with Game of Thrones where we're generally a long way behind.

Use Table top gaming news for the release info for any FFG stuff. This article has the release info for first half of July.

## 16 [Mestrahd on June 18, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/48309-release-date/?do=findComment&comment=487302)

So that means it's not coming out until July? I was still holding out hope we'd see it in June.

## 17 [Kobold Curry Chef on June 18, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/48309-release-date/?do=findComment&comment=487342)

If it hit the boat on June 2nd, the date the Upcoming page was updated, then most likely it'll hit stores in the week after July 4th.  Of course, all sorts of things can delay shipments, so who knows really?  That's just my best guess, based on watching the Upcoming page for various products over the last year or two.

The info on TTGN comes from FFG. So it is not gonna be seen till first half of July, course that could be in the first week of the month so early July. Maybe.

I woudn't be surprised if someone at FFG is gonna be fired (or was sacked already). They did not predict that LOTR base game will be sold out so soon and then they probably had to shift their strategy. In the meantime, they lost fraction of potential gain and customers, since the best time to sell the game is when it is ultra hot. And then, they lost some of possible customers of APs when they got bored with base game and AP are still not available.

## 20 [Toqtamish on June 18, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/48309-release-date/?do=findComment&comment=487431)

I am sure they will all come crawling back soon as the pack hits the shelves.

3 months for the first chapter pack seems like a long time though... they better release the second pack only a few weeks after the first! happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]

Sadly, that's probably not going to happen.  The other adventure packs are still "At the Printer."  They need to start getting them "On the Boat" soon if they don't want a delay in the release of second adventure pack.

## 23 [Glaurung on June 20, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/48309-release-date/?do=findComment&comment=488287)

I also get angry!!! Waiting waiting this first adv pack. But most bad thing is:  Hunt for gollum will come than after 1week is done and again wait for month or two until next one??? Very strange policy a? I dont understand FFG.

## 24 [jesseolivier2 on June 22, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/48309-release-date/?do=findComment&comment=489325)

 so i fount out my local store Lied to me... they never had it in to begin with.. i have no idea what incentive they had to lie... I guess ill be waiting for the mystery date like everyone else

Bloody liers. Gotta soldier on, sir.

What I've read on the forum of the italian distributor:

the whole Mirwkood cycle pack (at least in the italian version), has already been printed and is due in a single shipping.

There is no way to know if it holds for other languages and / or the english version, but common sense would suggest so.

## 27 [lleimmoen on June 23, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/48309-release-date/?do=findComment&comment=489725)

So we can hope that once we've waited so long for the first, the others shall arive in more frequent intervals.

## 28 [Svenn on June 23, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/48309-release-date/?do=findComment&comment=489811)

Aw man, I just noticed the delay on the Hunt for Gollum pack. This was listed as June 30th from what I saw, which is the day after my Birthday. I was hoping to pick myself up a nice birthday present...

## 29 [gatharion on June 23, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/48309-release-date/?do=findComment&comment=490140)

 I'm bummed that Fantasy Flight isn't at Origins. I was hoping to pick up a pack this weekend and try out some organized play. Unfortunately, I won't be able to make it to Gen Con.

FFG raise your threat by 5 due to dropping the ball on a smooth LotR:LCG adventure pack release.  This game is so good I'm willing to wait but remember you loose if your threat exceeds 49 ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

## 31 [Gaereth Baerethson on June 24, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/48309-release-date/?do=findComment&comment=490184)

Are they going to release foreign language packs the same day as the english ones? I bought my core set in french as english was sold out. and I want all my cards in the same language. But, I will not wait for the french pack if the english one is release.

## 32 [Morbid666 on June 25, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/48309-release-date/?do=findComment&comment=490877)

On Amazon it says release date is July 20th...love the game, but this stinks!

That's awesome, I'm very glad to read your post after today's nth preview of Hunt for Gollum still not announcing a release date!

Looks like I'll be spamming refresh on my email today to check for any notification from my arranged seller, so that I can finally get mine ordered and shipped off asap!

Ok, back with some news, well I just went off the phone with Maelstrom and they said they got a bunch of games yesterday which they shipped directly to people who had already ordered and they are waiting now for a reprint for a least few days. :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

Yeah, I put all the packs on pre-order as soon as they were listed on the site. Seems to work out well for this one.

I wish they'd hurry up; I've got a $200 order sitting, ready to ship, being held up by Hunt for Gollum and Merchants and Marauders. Chop-chop!
