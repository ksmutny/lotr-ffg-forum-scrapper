So quick question when is the Arwen hero with the sweet art coming out or did I miss something? I mean the cycle is almost over.

Wasn't that used for a quest card maybe?

Maybe at Nin-in-Eilph. There is still no spoiler yet but it will be an tactik hero. So maybe Arwen...

That image was used in one of the quests from Voice of Isengard, specifically in Into Fangorn, quest 2A/B.

By the way, Nin-il-Eliph comes out in a couple of days! <3

Bummer. That would have made a great Arwen hero portrait…

Yeah that was used as a quest card. I really really really want a Arwen Hero card though. Hopefully soon.

Yeah, quest cards usually have really amazing art on them. Players would prefer to have it on player cards... Of course, Magali's work is always welcome.

Apparently the German language version of Nin-in-Eilph was for sale at Essen, but I haven't seen any spoilers posted anywhere yet :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]
