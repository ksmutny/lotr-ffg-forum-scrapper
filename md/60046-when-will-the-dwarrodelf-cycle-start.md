I'm eagerly awaiting the release of the next adventure pack cycle. Any idea when the first one will go on sale?

The only one who knows this answer also knows Tom Bombadil's real nature...

 Redhorn Gate is "on the boat," so that probably (hopefully) means sometime this month.

I'm hoping for an announcement on Monday that it's on sale. That still means it'll be about a fortnight before I get it here in the UK, but at least the ball will be rolling...

Redhorn Gate was only listed on the boat as of a few days ago, so I wouldn't expect it before the week of March 5-9th.

That is the other question, yes!

I was basing my hope on KD being released early in January, anyway...

Well, normally they've had LOTR articles on Mondays, but last week they skipped Monday and did it on Friday, so who knows at this point...

Well, if your read like me the new article, you will see that they manage to write 2 more articles like this one and they will talk about the new hero in the third. I believe that we won't see the new chapter before a few weeks at least...

Quite- if they aren't spoiling the hero for a fortnight, that's probably 3 weeks till official release- around mid-March or later in the UK.

While us Finns could get Redhorn in April and it would still be relevant in that regard gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif] .

Said as the temperature this morning was -29 Celsius aplauso.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/aplauso.gif] . Finally feeling like a proper winter.

 So it switched to "On the Boat" as of January 23rd. That puts it in the first full week of March at the latest. Unless it gets Hunt for Gollum'ed.
