Hi Folks,

 

played a game of Ruins of Belegost on OCTGN last evening and a question came up.

 

For example me and my friend has two enemies (me1, me2, friend1, friend2) engaged during the combat phase and its me to beginn with the enemy attacks.

 

me1 has the following shadowcard attached:

 

Orc-of-Ered-Luin.jpg [https://s3.amazonaws.com/hallofbeorn-resources/Images/Cards/The-Ruins-of-Belegost/Orc-of-Ered-Luin.jpg]

 

So me1 engages my friend after its attack and makes a new attack, which my friend has to defend ..

Then me2 attacks me ...

After that its on my friend's turn to choose attackers .. will me1 attack now?

Yes. As far as I know.

 

Immediate attacks do not count as a normal attack within the combat phase.

They are extra attacks and as your friend's turn comes up after yours it will do it's normal attack.

This quest is great, but full of extra attacks, so beware.
