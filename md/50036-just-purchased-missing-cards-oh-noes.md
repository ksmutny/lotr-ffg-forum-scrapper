Hi all -

I just purchased this game and discovered my set is missing some cards and contains extras of other.  I send an email to customer service.  Would this be the best way to hopefully resolve the problem?  Thanks for any help.

I assume this is from the new printing as I have been waiting for my FLGS to get them in stock and it finally arrived to them this week.  Below is the info in case other discover similar issues with the new printing.

Gloin #3 -1 card (no copies in set)
Gimli #4 +1 card (1 extra copy)

 

this pattern continues

Dunhere #9 -1 card (no copies)
Denethor #10 +1 card (1 extra)

Guard of the Citadel #13 -1 copy
Faramir #14 +1 copy

Brok Ironfist #19 -1 copy (no copies)
Ever Vigilant #20 +1 copy

For Gondor #22 -1 copy
Sneak Attack #23 +1 copy

Feint #34 -1 copy
Quick Strike #35 +1 copy

Stand Together -1 copy (no copies)
Blade of Gondolin +1 copy

Dwarven Axe #41 -1 copy
Horn of Gondor #42 +1 copy

I believe that is what the Proof of Purchase button in the cardboard is for. Give that number to Customer Service and they can help you out.

Thanks I did not think of including that originally, but I have sent it off as well.  Looks like this set was manufactured in May, if I am reading the proof of purchase correctly, so I am guessing this confirms the second printing.

Yeah that was a second printing.

TBH, with the exception of the two missing heroes, it sounds like you got a good deal. Missing some crap cards and doubling up on some onesies and twosies.

What about Brok Ironfist?  He seems like a decent singleton card that I am missing... although I've only played once so far so not much for me to base that on yet.

He's got decent stats for an ally, but he costs 6. If his ability were to bring him into play upon ANY dwarf leaving he'd be golden.

I feel sorry for FFG if this is what all of the May printed sets are like...there is going to be some major postage mojo going down!

Since you have the reprinted version, I'm curious if they changed the wording on the Beastmaster or the Nazghul encounter card?

They did not.

Does anyone know how FFG handled card errata in their other LCGs? Have they reprinted the corrected cards and made them available via proof or purchase or included them in future boxed expansions?

if they were smart they would include them all in a future adventure pack (reprints + adventure pack cards).  by offering them free via proof of purchase, they will lose a lot of money whereas combining them with an expansion, they garauntee a future purchase and satisfy the community all in one shot.  alternatively, and preferably, they could release an exlcusive expansion pack that includes the reprints and all the cards to complete a full core set (total to 3 of each card) ie. core set + expansion = 3 of each card.

With Descent the first expansion (I believe it was the first) included replacement cards to swap out in the original game.  I suspect they would of liked/wished to update these cards but the demand was so high and so sudden for the reprint they decided to get it out as fast as possible.  Which is fine with me, I didn't want to wait any longer after missing the boat on the first printing!  I didnt' preorder and figured "plenty of these will show up at my FLGSs..." not!

At least in CoC later reprints of APs include errata. You have to buy the cards again, though, they're not available for free.
