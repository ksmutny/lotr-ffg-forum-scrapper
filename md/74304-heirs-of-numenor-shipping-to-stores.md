Same here, I usually wait until it's available in the UK at least… but it's hard to resist!   llorando.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/llorando.gif]

My faithful 13th floor has been known to get stuff within a week of the US date (they actually had RtM three working days after its US release, which is still something I look back on fondly), so I'm hoping if the US release is 21st, they'll have it by the end of November. My fingers and toes are, for now, firmly crossed…

Has that 13th floor an online site for sales or just an phisical company? If it has a site, can you point me to that?

doitsoitdoitdoit!!! Seriously though, you should really consider miniaturegames. I just pre-ordered it for $32,66 which included international first class mail to Norway. I have only made one per-order from them before but think I had I whithin or at least te week after FFG got it in their store. And they ALWAYS have good prices :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Well, I guess you do, BUT it boils down to what the rules are for UK. In Norway everything imported is custom and tax free if the value of the package is $34,66. So this time no I don't have to pay anything. In DK the upper limit is only $13,68. But in any regards if you don't really know the limit for Uk I'd write to them and ask if they could put the value printed on the package to like $10 or $5. Just to be sure. Also, here in Norway there's this crazy rule that if for say the package has a value of $33,66 and cost $10 to ship, then it's tax free. But if it cost $35 and $10 to ship you pay tax of $45!!! So investigate the rules in Uk :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Indeed they are. I actually have no idea if they have a physical store, they're on the other side of the country to me. But they've served me well online thus far!

 In the words of Rainbow Dash, "SO AWESOME!" /)^3^(

I can't wait to see the player cards! I hope Faramir is that second hero the box. I'm kind of annoyed that he was an ally while Boromir and Denethor were heroes. :|
