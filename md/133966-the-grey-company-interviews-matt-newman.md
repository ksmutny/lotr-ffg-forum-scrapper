Listening to the podcast now.  On the subject of fatigue, the thing that burns me out quickest is playing quests with very long setup times and lots of mechanical complexity.  When I find myself spending half my time either preparing or triple checking counters, triggers and tokens each turn, I feel unceremoniously removed from the fantasy.  I'd like to see more creative deckbuilding on the part of the encounter deck to avoid over-complexity.

 

Having finished The Black Riders and now getting into The Road Darkens, the campaign feels like its picking up baggage.  The amount of components to keep track of is getting crazy.

 

Still liking the game though.

30 minutes?! That is optimistic! We used to insist on doing at least 3 games, to make the set up/take down time worth it!

Honestly, I wouldn't mind it so much, but with family and work and everything else, I've got about 1.5 hours of game time per week and I like to make it count.   :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

What about Battles of Westeros?

 

I have been to weddings that required less setup time than that!

The fatigue I experience is mostly due to the fact that I play solo about 95% of the time. like others have said between work and family having little time to game and then getting beat over and over again can get old. I am very excited about where the game is going.

Thanks for all the work Grey Company!

This game is cool when you olay solo but with many players you can see some ciol things which you never see in solo game. This game edges is really wide so if you play only solo you dont see many

"This game is cool when you play it solo, but when you play it with many players - you can see some cool stuff going on which you'll never see in a solo game (encounter deck synergy).
