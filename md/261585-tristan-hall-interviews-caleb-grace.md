A bit late to the party but always gold!

Here [https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1862253/interview-lead-designer-caleb-grace] you go!

Just wanted to say that is a great interview with two people that I admire: Tristan Hall (a.k.a. Ninjadorg and the creator of the gorgeous Gloom of Kilforth) and Caleb Grace (which I guess that we already know :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]).

Cheers!

I assumed they'd all died tbh.

Quiet as a tomb around here.

Did they drop any good intel? Aside from gaem not being ded.

No not really. Caleb does say that "the line will continue", but the interview is around 6 months old.

No, this is from before The Mountain of Fire came out so he focuses on that. Otherwise, he mostly talks about the general design process on LotR and his interest in other IPs. 

My interest in the game has waned a bit in the last year, mostly because of lack of time and energy, but I just had a look at the Upcoming page on FFG.com for the first time in a long while and with all the reprints they're doing I see why there hasn't been much talk of future stuff yet.
