I was lucky to draw two goblin snipers on my first and second turn during questing phase.

Is this a death sentence? Or if you clear the staging area of non-Goblin Snipers, you can optionally engage one of them? My guess is you can't(and this is how I ruled it that game), but still…

I believe they are stuck there, but you can bring them down individually with Son of Arnor, kill them with Gandalf or Dunhere, or ignore them if you have Daughter of Nimrodel (sp?), Self-preservation etc.)

Well, I know the options to take them out of here, but neither of it was available that time.

It was Denethor, Theodred and Eowyn. Gandalf was used to kill Hill Troll.

Since you have Denethor (Lore), could just ignore them and heal the damage with Daughter of Nimrodel (or Warden of Healing if you have that expansion).

 If you were playing Anduin, and you don´t have a Gandalf left, it is a death sentence.

Unfortunately, nor daugthers neither another 2 Gandalfs I had somewhere in the deck appreaded until my very defeat.

And this irremovable constant 4 threat in the staging area is just sick. Add the adder(lol).
