Hello I have just finished reading the rule book, but I have a question:

 

Lets say I have 2 enemies engaged with me, they attack so I defend, then I attack; the result is that they survive, so I want to know:

IN THE NEXT ROUND ARE THEY STILL ENGAGED WITH ME? AND MORE IMPORTANT DO THEY STILL CONTRIBUTE THEIR THREAT LEVEL?

 

THANKS

They are still engaged with you, but do not contribute their threat during the quest phase.  Also remember that once a location is designated as the active location, its threat does not count anymore either.

Ok, I thought that was what was going to happen, but sincerely thanks a lot.
