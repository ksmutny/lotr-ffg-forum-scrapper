Hi!
Can I use Háma response on Foe-Hammer immediately after he attacks and kills enemy? Both reactions are triggered at the same time?

Hama's response is triggered at the moment he exhausts when declaring the attack. Foe-hammer triggers later in the attack sequence, when the enemy is actually destroyed. These are separate distinct steps in a player attack.

Yes, the combo works. You declare the attack (exhasuting Hama), trigger his response, resolve the attack, and play Foe-Hammer. Or Faux-Hama as I like to call it.

Where for hammer is in the first place when you declare Hama as attacker? In your hand or in the discard pile?

Either way, you can play it on the enemy Hama attacks.

But you can't have it back in hand on hand at the end of the combat, that is Halberto point, I think.

If you have Foe-hammer in hand and attack with Hama, you can exhaust a weapon on Hama to use it. But, at the point at which you trigger Foe-hammer, the opportunity to use Hama's ability is past.

If you make a second attack (after readying Hama, perhaps with a Rohan Warhorse), at the moment you declare your attack, you may return Foe-hammer to your hand, discarding another card. Then, if you destroy the enemy, you can trigger Foe-hammer again.

So, if you have Foe-hammer in-hand at the start of an attack, you cannot use it and return it to your hand as a part of that attack.

If you have Foe-hammer in the discard pile at the start of an attack, you can return it to hand and then use it in response to the attack.

What I was trying to say.

What I hope didn't sound like what I was saying.

Correct.
