thank you ffg- this is the best thing you could have done to get more users to this forum….and its great for people like me who dont want to go elsewhere as they are known best here

so thanks!

looking forward to being able to like posts….one suggestion….and this isnt at all influenced by my 3500+ posts ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] …but could we have forum rankings, such as

0-100 post = lazy hobbit

100-1000 = adventurous hobbit

1000-2000 = brave hobbit

2000-3000= fearsome hobbit

…you get the idea :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

In my experience, titles based on number of posts are generally a Bad Idea™ and just lead to flooding of posts without any substance (responses that say stuff like "me too!" and "good post" and nothing else)

@khamul -there used to be a post counter, but thats just an estimate from going onto my posts list on my profile and multiplying the amount of posts per page by the page amount. its over 3500, but its at least that

@grandspleen - that is true, but its nice to have some sort of reward for loyal posting :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

FFG is updating software on July 1st (i.e. not updated yet). They said the forums will be down a couple days, but no content will be lost. The LOTR Quest Log will get an update too.

See the article concerning this process here: http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=4221 [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=4221]

to little to late. The majority of the communities have long ago moved form this site. LoTR being a bit of exception as it is really active in relation to the other games, yet still a void compared to other sites. BGG is where most of the action is and for some games cardgameDB… still it is good to see that they are addressing what imo was a complete and total … epic proportions to the community, not having a community site that worked. I hope among the features is a report function, block function, and edit your own post function and a normal BBcode system so we can do proper quotes and stuff, favorite system would be nice, polls… just modern it up please! This could be a new era for FFG… do not screw us over again!

## 15 [richsabre on July 3, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85631-new-forum-softwarethank-you-ffg/?do=findComment&comment=807478)

well here it is....what do we all think?

theres plenty of nice features, its quick which is the best thing, and i even got my member titles, which can be anything you want!

the profile feed doesnt seem to work for me....and for some reason i cannot like posts

rich

ps- im not particularly liking these warning points, and the fact they are so visible on the side....they surely arent that important to display

I hate it.  Only thing that i like is number of posts and the title thing. (pretty cool) otherwise the whole setup and new look I hate....

WHAT IS THIS! They took my Beorn profile avatar away! Oh well. I guess I'll have to live with being a Stone Giant from now on. And Rich, how did you get those member title things?

Finally a fast forum! Some theme things should be improved for readability (profile settings is horrible), but hey... not bad.

They may add it (and others) in the following days.

Yep, can't recall where my grumpy dude avatar was from, however, this image does quite accurately portray my mood whenever a rules question is asked that can be found with a quick perusal of the rules/FAQ  :lol: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_laugh.png] .

They seem to be visible only to yourself, but you are right. I don't like them either.

> WHAT IS THIS! They took my Beorn profile avatar away! Oh well. I guess I'll have to live with being a Stone Giant from now on. And Rich, how did you get those member title things?

go onto your profile and 'edit profile' then it is where it says 'member title'

 

as for the rest of the forum, i have had time to think, and i like the obvious - fast posting, member post count and title, subscription to posts....but i really dislike the following:

 

1- some features do not work. i cannot like things or update my 'feed'. whilst these are little gimmicky things i was sort of looking forward to them. i assume they will be fixed though

2-the warning counter is far to visible...i feel like i am being watched. what exactly would you get warnings for? i hope this forum isnt going to turn into one of those ultra moderated ones...i really enjoyed the fact that this forum was respectful on its own without moderation

3-some of the avatars seem to have dissapeared, thankfully mine has not

4-the preview banners at the top of the page have dissapeared. this makes them far less visible

5- those who have not selected an avatar have a bigger 'image' than when you do

6- the overall look is nice but a bit difficult to see content...not sure why that is, perhaps the font is smaller?

7- you cannot see who posted last on a topic

Hmm... That last point of yours is odd. I could have sworn that when I first looked at the new forums it did in fact say who posted last. But now, it only says replies and views. Strange.

Come on, don't you just want to earn a few, just to see what you can buy with them  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]  ? Next time Rich posts about his hobbit-loveins, he'll get some  :lol: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_laugh.png]  !

Ban of some length would be my guess.

 

 

Also, I'm more and more convinced Rich is actually a hobbit. IIRC, he's said he lives in the middle of nowhere (at least as far as other players are concerned), that's just like the Shire was out of the way for normal people  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] .

Hey, at least the "mark threads as read" fuction works in just a couple of seconds compared to the old, which sometimes took minutes.

Likes should now be fully functional. Avatar libraries will grow in time but first we want to make sure the forums are working well for everyone. We apologize to anyone who lost their favorite images, but hope that 1,500+ avatar images are sufficient for the time being.

i like the new forum. just the speed of it alone makes the change worthwhile i reckon. no more sitting waiting for it to load for 2 minutes, or watching it hang in the middle of doing something... it's heaven!

 

i agree with other people that it would be nice to get the most recent news articles posted above the forum again, though. That's the main place where i see them.

The new Quest.Log is not structured well. Before, we could see the quest-view list in the right chronologic order, but now there isnt any order. Now it's a chaos.

Should be improved very soon.
