Well, they said 4th quarter 2011... so maybe. I'm betting on December though.

I bet December and here is my logic. 

 

Still have two adventure packs to come out.  1 in October and 1 in November.  That makes Kaz the December release for LoTR LCG.

I just saw a date of December 31 on a website that I have ordered from in the past. Not sure how accurate that would be, as far as the exact day, but I agree on the month.

December 31st would be a stupid release date.

Sadly, all the evidence so far, seems to be that FFg concentrate all their energies on designing cards (which in itself is good), and leave none for sorting out release and avilability schedules.

Making this available in time for Christmas is SURELY a no-brainer.

 True, if it's not going to be purchasable for Christmas, there's no reason really good reason to release it in December.

We needs it. Wonder how face smashingly difficult the 3rd scenario of KD will be? "Dol Guldur took one of your heroes prisoner...Khazad Dum kills two of them during setup!"

Glaurung: "Boooring! Too easy!"
