So being new to he game I keep seeing all of these adventures that were gencon exclusives. I am unable to attend gencon most years but would still like to be able to get these. Are they ever made available as print on demand or anything like that?

Yes, all GenCon quests are eventually released as Print-on-Demand products. The above picture is an image of the FFG POD LotR:LCG store section. You may also want to browse on-line retailers such as CoolStuffinc, Miniature Market or Amazon as they usually sell the GenCon quests at a better price. It typically takes 3-6 months after GenCon for these quests to be released to the general public.

 

FFG has also hosted a Fellowship Event in October/November the past two years for which they produce a special quest. This Fellowship Quest (Fog on the Barrow Downs in 2014 and Murder at the Prancing Pony in 2015) is also eventually released via POD.

 

Keep in mind that FFG usually provides some extra swag (alt-art cards, play-mats) to the attendees of the GenCon quest and the Fellowship quests. These products can only be obtained at the event itself (or via E-bay, etc) and are not available when the quests go up on POD.

Ok cool. I'm planning to hit gencon this year. How do the events work? Do they have prebuilt decks or do people just show up with decks and hope they don't have cards that other people have in their decks?

The latter.

 

If you plan to go with a group of friends, you can coordinate decks.

If you don't plan to go with a group you can also build decks tailored towards heroes/cards that are less popular so you don't have conflicts with others, or build multiple decks so you have options, or bring additional "side board" cards that you can swap in if someone else is playing a thing you already are.

 

If you do plan to go to Gen-Con, I highly suggest making sure you pre-select the events you want to attend once you are allowed to do this (closer to the actual event) and then when the sales go live be sure you are already logged in and at your computer.  click immediately!  lol.   Seats for basically every event are limited and will go rather quickly.  LotR events are typically smaller so they fill up very fast.  

 

At Gen-Con, when the event starts you just trade your ticket in for the encounter pack and then are free to go play it with whoever is around.
