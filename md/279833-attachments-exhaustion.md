I had been firing questions back to back in last couple of days, testing your patience :). I had so many confusions in general game rules now all of them is cleared except this last one;

Attachments Exhaustion

Online rule reference book says under 'Attachment Card's paragraph;

"An attachment card readies and exhausts independently of the card to which it is attached."

That (an attachment is also gets exhausted) I totally missed when reading the instructions book came with the box. So does this means, every time we play an attachment car (use an action), the attachment card exhausts (independently of the card to which it is attached) until end refreshment phase? If so, it means a card should be ready to be able to "act", "respond", whatever.

Well, this wasn't causing any confusion to me, since was applying actions/responses once per round only anyway, but just asking this in case there is a card would affect exhausted attachments or something.

Attachments only exhaust if there is some reason to exhaust them.  For example, in the core set Unexpected Courage exhausts to ready the attached hero, and Steward of Gondor exhausts to give you two resources.  Exhausting the attachment prevents you from performing that action again.

By contrast, Blade of Gondolin does not exhaust to give its +1 attack when attacking an orc, or to use its response of placing progress when you kill an enemy with it.  You can trigger that response every time.

The Foe-Hammer event allows you to exhaust an attached weapon when a hero kills an enemy in order to draw three cards.  If you played that event and exhausted your Blade of Gondolin, it wouldn't affect the Blade at all -- but it would prevent you from playing a second Foe-Hammer card in response to the kill.

There are no cards that currently allow you to ready an attachment, and there's unlikely to be any that do so.  Attachments only ready in the refresh phase.

Ok, I see that I got this one wrong. Kind of. All clear now.

Thank you very much for all your help in last 3 days, ladies and gentlemen! You had been very helpful and fast to help!

Don’t be shy to ask.  We are all happy to help :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

the mistake would be to NOT ask and get frustrated

I have a follow-up question to this about attachments and heroes during the 'ready' Phase.  In short, can an attachment ready when the hero it is attached to does not?

The reason I would want to is my hero has caught in a web and I exhausted Steward of Gondor to gain 2 resources.  But I want to save those resources for a player card rather than ready the hero.  But during the ready phase can I ready the steward of Gondor by itself while the hero is prevented from doing so by Caught in a Web?

 

Thank You!
