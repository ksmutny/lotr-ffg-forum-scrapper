# [Triggered effects list and sequence of play](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58240-triggered-effects-list-and-sequence-of-play/)

## 1 [zeb on December 31, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58240-triggered-effects-list-and-sequence-of-play/?do=findComment&comment=573022)

If like me you have struggled to play triggered effects at the correct time in the sequence of play, I have compiled a list of these effects I found in the cards in the Core and expansion sets and placed them relatively to sequence chart extracts according to the rules, FAQ and latest clarifications from Nate. I also give an example of a card for each one of these. I only omitted the "during X phase" triggers as they are ususally condition specific (in addition to time specific) and tricky to place in the chart.

I hope this may be useful. Also, please let me know if I missed some or if I made some errors.

Very nice!

Only one thing:

Phase 3 : Quest

    Step 3 : Quest Resolution
    Willpower > Threat
        Forced: After the players quest successfully [The Hunt Begins THFG]
    or Willpower < = Threat
        Forced: After the players have quested unsuccessfully [Dungeon Jailor]


I think that there should be Willpower <  Threat, without "=".

I am not sure. I think that you are considered having quested successfully only if Willpower is strictly higher than Threat. Otherwise it is not successful. I'll check, but I think it is in the FAQ.

Unrelated: I am also planning to add some during and defeated conditions too.

## 9 [LEGA on January 3, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58240-triggered-effects-list-and-sequence-of-play/?do=findComment&comment=574150)

I'm not sure too but:

1. FAQ: As soon as the players determine that the total committed Willpower is greater than the total Threat in the staging area, they are considered to have quested successfully.

2. Rules: If the Willpower is higher, the players have successfully quested, and they make progress on the quest.

If the Threat power is higher, the players have unsuccessfully quested, and they are driven back by the encounter deck.

So in case of tie quest is neither successful nor unsuccessful.

Or you mean that they include it in FAQ to determine the tie case to be unsuccessful?

LEGA said:

Well, I am not sure anymore. Indeed I thought that the FAQ defined the successful case and that all other cases meant unsuccessful, including when Willpower and Threat are equal. Does that mean that if they are equal, then one does not apply either succesful and unsuccessful triggers?

this is news to me too, is this the actual ruling then, so if a card states if players quest unsuccessfully do such and such, and you end up being equal that card effect doesnt happen?

On P14 of the rules it says "If the combined committed willpower score is equal to the combined threat score in the staging area: no progress tokens are placed. and the players do not increase their threat dials"

So Becuase the players have neither quested successfully nor unsuccessfully, any effects triggered by questing successfully or unsuccessfully would not occur. You could see it as the party is stuck, they haven't made progress but they haven't lost ground either.

I'm curious as to how you've been playing in this situation?

ive been playing it as equal threat=unsucessfull questing, but i do see the above points as more valid

This is how I have been playing as well. You are neither were successful nor unsuccessful.

zeb - thanks again for creating this thread. I think it's a great resource.

That said, I don't know if you want to expand it or not, but I was thinking that adding "adventure specific" sections could be quite helpful.

For example, Hunt for Gollum and Dead Marshes (others too, but those two especially come to mind) have some unique aspects added to the questing phase and/or the escape check mechanic. It seems like there are frequent questions and common misunderstandings that pop up around those elements all the time.

Anyway, no pressure to add to what you've got, but it would compliment well what you already have going here.

Many thanks, that is a good idea indeed. I do not have a lot of time now, but will try to continue this chart as much as possible.

Note to oneself: add "After X leaves play" effects, and "Response: After X..." (such as the Dwarrowdelf Axe) that must follow Forced effects, thus increasing the granularity of this turn sequence sheet.

I am now wondering if I should actually do a complete turn sequence sheet, but there are excellent ones around.

Sorry for not maintaining this document too often, I miss some time. Anyway, I add "When X attacks", should solve step 1 of Enemy attacks.

Example:

Dol Guldur Beastmster CORE 91
Should read: "Forced: When Dol Guldur Beastmaster
attacks…"
The additional shadow card is dealt when the Dol
Guldur Beastmaster is chosen during step 1 of enemy
attack resolution.

Oh, then there's another rules inconsistency. A Snow Warg (Redhorn Gate) also has such an effect. ("When Snow Warg attacks, deal1 damage to the defending character, if able.") Since the defender gets declared in step 2 of enemies' attacks, there is no defender at this point, and it will never be possible to deal that damage…

Well spotted. I guess that in that case, the "When X attacks" trigger should apply depending on the context.

"The additional shadow card is dealt when the Dol Guldur Beastmaster is chosen during step 1 of enemy attack resolution"

English is not my native language, so am I misinterpreting? What does "dealt" mean here? Put the card face down and resolve it immediately at the end of step 1, or put the shadow card face down during step 1 and resolve it during step 3?

Obviously for the Snow Warg, the When X attacks effect should be effective after the defender is selected, so at the end of step 2.

thanks for collecting all these together, its pretty handy. i've put them together with the other rules, and combined them into one sheet, if anyone is interested - www.boardgamegeek.com/image/1327354/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-card-game [http://www.boardgamegeek.com/image/1327354/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-card-game]

Hm, I think it would be better to have a strict definition, which doesn't depend on players judging about it… I guess the best solution would be to make an erratum for Snow Warg. But it's not really important, since it's pretty clear to everyone what the designer wanted to do (deal the dmg at the end of step 2 like you said)…

Deal a shadow card = move from top of the encounter deck next to the enemy, but don't flip it around yet. Flipping to face-up happens in step 3, where the shadow effect is resolved.

Thanks.

I have updated my chart wih the Snow Warg effect. I guess the "When X attacks" effect ruling should be that it should be applied as early as possible in the Enemy Attack sequence, as soon as the conditions are fulfilled. The rules say Forced effects are applied "whenever their specified prerequisite occurs." So for the Snow Warg, this should trigger once they attack and once the defender is known. However, I agree with you that the turn sequence and the trigger text lack consistency and a finer granularity.

Added "Before X is dealt damage" from the Patrol Leader in KD. Considering this is may need to be repeated as many times as required (such as using 1 or 2 Dwarrodelf Axes on him), but that is a basic rule to repeat Forced effects for each new triggering instance.

Added:

- "After attached hero attacks and destroys an enemy": first Response I add here. I wanted to avoid responses but this one has a defined timing.

- "When X is attacked": I assume this has to happen at the beginning of the Player attack phase, at the end of step 1, similarly to the fact that a "When X attacks" for enemies, this happens during step1/2 of Enemy attack phase.

Also, some Forced effects become tedious: When X is dealt damage (like the Patrol Leader in KD): I initially put his Forced effect at the end of step 3 of Player Attack sequence. Actually, it could occur during Staging (Step 2 of Quest) with Thalin, who deal 1 damage to each enemy as it is revealed. Thus I repeated this Forced effect in Step 2 of Quest. But this could occur anywhere else where it is possible to deal damage to it.
Maybe I should put this kind of Forced effect outside of this chart, in a "variable timing" category?

Some afterthoughts of what we said: I suppose that one day we could have a card saying "Forced: When X attacks, reduce by 1 the Defense Strength of the defending character". Therefore, the "When X attacks" would apply only at step 4, during the calculation of the combat damage. This lead me to think that this "When X attacks trigger" is applied not at a particular step of the Enemy Attack sequence, but during the sequence as a whole, and that it also depends on which condition follows the "When X attacks" trigger. The fact it is Forced means it cannot be cancelled with a Response or a subsequent Player action then.
