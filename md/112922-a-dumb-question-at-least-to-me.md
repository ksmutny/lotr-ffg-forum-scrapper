# [A Dumb Question (At least to me)](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/112922-a-dumb-question-at-least-to-me/)

I feel like I'm wasting my time on this, but I can't find an explanation on the Internet or otherwise. I hate to bug the forum over a trivial matter, but I figure I'd ask. I'm guessing I know the answer.

 

I'm a father of a very smart 8-year old. He's such a smartie, when he heard about October's Fellowship event, he signed up to show everyone how to play Tactics the right way. I didn't think much of it until I was reading my Over Hill and Under Hill box I use for the counters. In the lower right hand corner, with all the legalese was the following in bold letters: 'This product is not a toy. Not intended for use of persons 13 years of age or younger.'

 

My assumption, which I assume is correct, is that this is there to scare away people who believe they're buying toys. My son loves this game, and is constantly wanting to challenge every scenario we get. I can hardly think FFG would not want him to play if he understands the game so well.

 

Any responses, negative or not, are appreciated. Thank you in advance.

There is no questionable content in the game.  No profanity, nudity, just very abstract violence.

 

That warning is probably there because FFG felt the game was too complex for kids under 13.  Sounds like your kid is a pro, though, and having a blast.  More power to him!

Well, there is some art that might be "violent;" Encounter at Amon Din has an Orc holding a human head that's been removed from its body - and there are heads on stakes in other art pieces, as well...

Just look at some Nightmare cards art... like Crazed Captive - one of the best pieces <3

I found the Dol Guldur Nightmare ones to be close to ... Graphic

 

Spoiler!!!!!
 

 

 

 

 

 

Its basically all torture rooms and things on the art... not very clear on the pictures of course, but still...

 

apart from that..yeah, just the odd orc getting an arrow into it, things like that :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Pennblade,

 

Maybe because i'm a person connected to the legal affairs (on Portugal), but for resting my mind, i would ask directly to FFG, or the place where he signed up, if there isn't a problem for him to play due to his age and the heads up on the products....

 

Otherwise he might get a surprise if he founds a strict person...

 

On the matter i agree with the majority, the heads up is there due to some images may be a bit violent

Thank you for your responses folks! I've already sent a message to FFG on CJMatos suggestion, and will be contacting the group holding the Fellowship event soon. I think it's safe to say that there's really not a problem, but I'll definitely update when I get a response. It'll be interesting to see the response when it arrives. :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

Thanks once again!

There are special laws and requirements for toys made for children under 13. So to avoid that they put that disclaimer on the box. It's more about that then any content in the game.

This has been resolved. From FFG customer support:

 

Michael,

 
That (language) is there only for legal reasons and will not affect your sons ability of participating October Fellowship event!
 
I hope that helps and as always, please contact us directly if you have any further questions or concerns.
