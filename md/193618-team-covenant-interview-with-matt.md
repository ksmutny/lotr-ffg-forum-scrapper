TC interviews Matt about the player cards in Carn Dum here:

In the interview Matt drops a couple of hints about the coming spirit hero.  He mentions that he or she will work well with the new Lindir and also that the "Elf twin deck is real and it's going to get more real."  So once again I am hoping for Arwen and I'm wondering if the ability will be something like "Discard a card to place 1 resource on any hero in play.  Limit 3 times per turn."

Yep, seems very likely it'll be Arwen, and hopefully too. Your idea makes a lot of sense, and with low threat and decent stats could be perfect for the deck. Wish these interviews were a bit more in-depth but very cool video nonetheless- Always great to see or hear the developers.

I dunno.   I'm not sure if it will be Arwen.  Possibly,  but we will see.  Although Liv Tyler brought her to life in the Peter Jackson movies,  Arwen is just not that important in the books.  She's barely even mentioned.  Granted that she's mentioned a lot more than like Berevor, or Amarthuriel, or any of the other FFG created heros, and probably more than some other cards we already have heroes for like Gloin... but still.  

The fact that she's not a hero already almost makes me think that she never will be.  This isn't the first time people have speculated about an Arwen hero and thus far we have all been disappointed.   Spirit hero,  Elf brothers getting more real?   Noldor cycle?  Yeah,  we're getting Spirit Aragorn =p.

That's another interesting possibility. Any deck where I can include Sword that was Broken is a plus in my book. Still, it kinda makes sense for it to be Arwen. I mean, we already have her as an ally and that's already kinda far fetched in that we are acually travelling with her. Now of course I know her ally version could be interpreted as representing her support, telepathy or whatever but we're not really with her physically, much like Galadriel hero. Well, her hero version could be just that, and her art could her looking from a window or something. I mean, you're totally right, it's not like Tolkien gave her a lot of character or made more appearances in the book, but even then I like her character, and a hero kinda similar to Galadriel would be just fine IMO. I also think it's a bit too early for another version of Aragorn to come out.

> "Discard a card to place 1 resource on any hero in play.  Limit 3 times per turn."

That would be nice because it would synergize with Core Aragorn too.

 

I think Arwen is a pretty good bet. She may not show up in the books all that much, but neither does Erestor and we have a hero version of him. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] I think it's only a matter of time until we get an Arwen hero, and this last pack seems like a good time to introduce her.

I would bargain that they are not going to release Spirit Aragorn in the same cycle they've released Tactics Aragorn. 

As for the ability to generate resouces by discarding cards, I might see something like this happening once per turn, but definitely not 3 times per turn as this will surely break the game easily, especially as those resources can be delivered across the board.

I think Arwen is a good bet. But I agree with those who think three times a round would be way too powerful. I think once per round is still very nice, especially if the stats are decent as well (and with Arwen we can expect at least 2 willpower and a lowish threat cost), and more so if it can be placed on any hero (even if only any under your control).

Maybe it is just a wishful thinking but discarding cards for resources is something that could really help the Noldor strategy, and certainly something to combo well with Lindir who then draws you cards when you play him. The fact he is mentioned specifically suggests you might actually be able to discard more than one card. Maybe it will be 2 cards for a resource? Either way, I cannot wait to see it...

Nice interview, it's always fun to hear the designers themselves talk about the cards.

 

Not sure why everybody loses their minds over 'attach to the threat dial'. Get back to me when we get a card 'attach to another player' and I'll share in the amazement. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

 

About Arwen: somehow I always assumed Arwen would be in this cycle. I don't think an ability of converting cards-to-resources would be wise, because combined with lore's resources-to-cards it can break the game easily. Just look at Love of Tales abuse.

But it fits well within Spirit, I feel. But again, it needs to be done with care.
