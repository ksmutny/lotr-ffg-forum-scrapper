What quest are you playing?  And are you saying that it is too easy?

this is the first time ive heard this asked. in this game you generally dont need to increase the difficulty as you have different difficulty levelled quests. so if mirkwood is too easy solo then try dol guldur

Diffrent quests scaled different with payers numbers. I suggest you to play with 4 players :  Dol-Guldor, Flight form Moria, Long Dark, Massing at Osgiliath, BAttle of the five Armies, Heir of Numenor quest and try any quest in new Against the Shadow cycle. Then try Nightmare mode this awesome too.

Stop playing passage through mirkwood.  Try Siege of Cair Andros, Into Ithilien, Lake Town, Battle of the 5 Armies, Nightmare Escape from Dol Guldur.   Oh god I can't wait for Nightmare Into Ithilien.
