Hello … sorry for my bad english. After some games, I have one question about the rules of the game:
When I get more tokens progress of those needed to bypass an active place (for example, I have 3 tokens and the active location needs 2 tokens to bypass), the rest go to the quest card or lost? Thanks

 When placing progress tokens on the active location, excess tokens do indeed go onto the current quest card.

Example: Active location has 0 progress tokens and needs 3 to be fully explored.  After questing you get to place 5 progress tokens; 3 will go onto the active location, exploring it.  The remaining 2 progress tokens go onto the quest card.

Note that if you finish a QUEST card, any excess progress tokens are lost.  There is carryover from active location to quest card, but not from quest card to the next quest card.

Now everything is clear, thank you very much for the reply!
