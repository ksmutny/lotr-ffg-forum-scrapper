And by CT, I don't mean Stratford or Danbury, as I consider those part of NY area. I'm talking North/Central CT near or around Hartford. Of course, if you ARE from the aforementioned pseudo-NY areas, feel free to represent!

I just joined the forums but IÂ am from Hamden, its down near new haven. i am digging the lotr card game, right now my favorite is still the board game though, hopefully the adventure packs will persuade me otherwise...
