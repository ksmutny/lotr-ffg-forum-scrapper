Biting wind reads:

Can i assign all damage that would be assigned by this effect to one character? (Or probably better: What actualy forbids me doing so, as knowing this game i have a hunch i'm not allowed to do hat....)

You cannot overkill a wimpy ally with effects like this. Each damage must actually be assigned so as to have an effect on the game. If it helps mentally, treat damage as assigned point by point; calculating hit points and if anything is destroyed before continuing placement.

The same rule does not apply to enemy attacks, though. If a character is killed by an enemy that has more attack strength than the defender;s combined health and defense, the overspill damage goes wasted. This is good strategy with allies like Snowbourn Scout.

The reference ruling for this goes back to at least 2013: https://boardgamegeek.com/article/13452505#13452505 [https://boardgamegeek.com/article/13452505#13452505]

It is odd that neither the FAQ nor the relatively recent Rules Reference has ever directly addressed this, so far as I can tell.
