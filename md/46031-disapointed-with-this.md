## 1 [ffgfan on April 30, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46031-disapointed-with-this/?do=findComment&comment=461348)

Ok, so I got the game. I've played it a lot and after many sessions, discusions with my friends I must say I'm disapointed with it a little.

I thought it will be great becouse it's set in the universe created by Tolkien with famous characters and adventures.

First of all I thought it will be more challenging to beat all scenarios - I beat all tree in a row after the first play. I just needed to make a two sphere deck.

Second I don't know whats the point of playing with more players when everyone is hidding there cards. This is cooperative game and after all You could just good play with Youre hand revealed.

Third I hope to get more from the core set. There's so few of enemies that after just a couple of plays You know them to well.

Fourth many good characters are Ally and that means that we won't see them as Heroes in the future.

Don't get me wrong. I love the art in this game and the atmosphere by the core set is just to small and I'm disapointed with it.

The game can be amazing but only after a few Adventure pack when we will have more of everything.

This is a common theme with most coop games.  It makes you rely on verbal skills over visual.  Intentions and action can be missunderstood when explained, especially when you are in the heat of a critical moment and everyone is discussing options.  If we all took the time to read everyones cards, not only would the game drag on, but it would lose flavor  (IMO).

This is just my opinion, but I don't see why FFG couldn't release a hero that was already released as an ally (or vise-versa).  You just wouldn't be able to play both versions of the cards at the same time.

Take Faramir for example, he would make a great hero.  I'm sure if FFG made him one, his abilities would be different, and while he's in play, you couldn't play the Faramir ally card.

I could even envision FFG making different versions of both heroes and allies, with different abilities as the game progresses.  Aragorn, King of Gondor vs. Aragorn, Ranger of the North vs. Aragorn, of the Three Hunters.

Thanks,

Don

If that is true (and if you're playing correctly) then it's fairly impressive: no one that I've seen on the forums has yet to beat scenario 3 with a dual-sphere deck due to losing one of your three heroes randomly. Beating it on the first try is even more impressive. What build are you using? Saying that you beat it easily leads me to believe you may have missed a rule or two, but I could be wrong!

As for the rest of the post, naturally there will be some people who don't care for the game, but from the reaction I've seen here and on BGG you are the minority.

I see the core set as an introduction to the game.I am waiting adventure packs to come and then i can say if this game is hard/easy bad or good.This is a coop game and and as all coop games sooner or later you will find a way to beat all scenarios with ease except if ffg finds a way and we can customize the encounter deck.

For now i just enjoy tha game and i see it as a casual ME game were you can use Tolkiens's characters places creuters to spend your time.

ps:ffgfan i also want to see many characters as heros in this game, i want to have Gandalf more time sad.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sad.gif].

No, I play with all normal rules. And beating scenarios was easy. The second - Journey along the Anduin was a little bit hard I must say but the other two were not. Especialy I thought that the last one - Escape from Dol Guldur will be very hard but it was not. Sometimes one of my heroes deid but still a beat the scenario so it still counts.

And about my deck - according to the rulebook You can have a max of 50 card deck, so I made such one. Among the 50 card were 3 copies of Gandalf. And my heroes were Eowin, Gimli and Legolas. The most simple strategy was to exhaust Eowin every time to the Quest, Gimli was perfect for defence and Legolas was the attacking one (so after killing enemies I always got some more progress tokens on the quest). It really is not that hard to beat all scenarios.

PS. the trick to beat Escape from Dol Guldur is simple - always first make the maxiumum progress on a Quest and after it take the objective card in the last moment to go to the next stage. And destrong the Dol Guldur Nazgul is easy when You have some good event cards in Your hand. Oh, nad the captured hero was Gimli.

So really the game is a little disapointment for me and at this point nothing can change that.

1. I think claiming that the last scenario was easy solo almost definitely means you forgot some rules.

2. Saying that "You play with all normal rules" does not mean that you forgot some rules, or, more likely, just overlooked some in the rulebook.

3. It's fairly obvious that taking the objective card at the last moment is important in beating the last scenario, and destroying the Nazgul is far from simple. There are no Tactics or Spirit cards (the two spheres that you were playing) that make it so. The only cards I can think of that make it fairly simple is Forest Snare (Knowledge) and Sneak Attack (Leadership), though on this I guess I could be wrong.

Long story short: I'd re-read the rulebook, just in case.

Seeing as you seem to be doing infinitely better than me or anyone I've heard of it would be nice to see a deck list and a play by play breakdown. E.g. for quest 2.

deck list, Starting heroes, initial draws, encounter deck draws and so on. I still haven't beaten quest 2 yet though I've yet to try a Eowyn, Legolas and Gimli build.

## 10 [Oshio on April 30, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46031-disapointed-with-this/?do=findComment&comment=461395)

Quest 2 is very beatable solo, but it is certainly tricky and requires the right build.

First, Legolas/Gimli/Eowyn will have a really tough time with Scenario 2, unless you are the type to just claim you beat it no problem ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]. But if you actually want to beat it the issue is your threat is going to be far too high, and come turn 2 you'll have to face the Troll, who will rocket up your threat. Now, if you get really lucky Gimli can take the hit first turn and then you can turn around and get rid of him turn 2, but if his shadow card gives him even 1 more axe Gimli's dead and your game is shot.

I've found the easiest way to deal with this scenario (without resorting to blind luck) is to play a mostly spirit deck with very low threat. My current Spirit/Leadership deck starts out at 25, buying me plenty of time before I have to face the Troll, and half the time I'll play a Galadrim's Greeting to buy myself even more time. This can allow me to set up a Sneak/Gandalf combo or something similar and take him out with no problem.

Knowledge can also do it, as they have access to Forest Snares, but you'd have to splash something else (probably Leadership!) to give you some attacking power. Denethor/Berevor/Theodred will give you 26 threat, which buys you a few turns...but you also lack access to Spirit's powerful threat reduction.

## 11 [servant of the secret fire on April 30, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46031-disapointed-with-this/?do=findComment&comment=461400)

Also if you have 2 core sets play with your friends competitive.Play the same scenario solo and then compare your score.Wen you play your turn your friend watches you for a fair play  and then you do tha same in his turn.

I think this will keep your interest for some time and it will force you to make better decks for better scoregui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif].

I mean no offense, but I find this hard to believe unless you are the luckiest or the greatest card player in creation. I too, would like to see a breakdown of how these games went.

## 13 [Acererak on April 30, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46031-disapointed-with-this/?do=findComment&comment=461409)

Claiming to have won the three scenarios in a row with the same deck the first time you try the game sounds like an impressive strike of luck to me or some inportant rule being overlooked, according to my own experience with the game and the reports I am reading from everyonw trying out this game solo. Noffense on my side here, really. Just a bit skeptical.

 

It would be great if you could post a little bit more detail After Action Report of how you beat the third quest. Which event cards you used to beat the Nazgul so fast for example? How to quest so fast at  the begining with just two heroes and a limited resource pool? Maybe we would all learn some tricks we have been overlooking, who knows...

## 14 [Oshio on April 30, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46031-disapointed-with-this/?do=findComment&comment=461410)

Personally, I think the lack of detail reinforces some of the comments here. But who knows, maybe he just got extremely lucky.

## 15 [conykchameleon on April 30, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46031-disapointed-with-this/?do=findComment&comment=461419)

I know it's probably not productive, but I have to put myself in the non-believer column as well here. I have yet to make it past Escape From Dol Goldur 1A in twenty-some odd tries with the exact deck he's referring to (Eowyn, Legolas, Gimli). And this was after fine-tuning both the build and the strategy in order to beat Journey Down the Anduin in twenty-some odd tries. There is just no way, unless I'm an idiot. (Which is still on the table)

## 16 [Ahzrab on April 30, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46031-disapointed-with-this/?do=findComment&comment=461421)

If you have time, I would love to see a game session breakdown from you ffgfan.

I share two core sets with a friend and have spirit/tactics as my own factions and I experienced that they have a horrible synergy.

## 17 [Oshio on April 30, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46031-disapointed-with-this/?do=findComment&comment=461426)

To try to turn this thread into something slightly productive, here's a few 'common mistakes' for ffgfan to make sure he's doing everything correctly.

* Are you adding 1 threat at the end of every turn?

* Are you exhausting characters to defend, then exhausting different characters to attack?

* Are you questing every turn, and if not questing adding the full threat in the staging area to your threat?

* Are you checking monsters threat level to see if they attack you themselves?

Anyone else know of any common mistakes they can add? I personally like the game and if you dislike it because it's too easy, I'd like to help you find the mistake you're making.

## 18 [Mestrahd on April 30, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46031-disapointed-with-this/?do=findComment&comment=461428)

Are you adding shadow cards to each attack? would be another common one I'd imagine.

## 19 [conykchameleon on April 30, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46031-disapointed-with-this/?do=findComment&comment=461434)

Here are another possible three:

 

1) Are you using Resource Match (i.e. Eowyn cannot pay for tactics cards, Gimli cannot pay for Spirit cards?)

 

2) Are you subtracting the Creatures' defenses when you attack them?

 

3) Are you putting undefended damage on only one or you heroes (not allies)?

## 20 [conykchameleon on April 30, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46031-disapointed-with-this/?do=findComment&comment=461435)

Sorry for the double post. Just also wanted to add props to CAlexander for taking the thread in a more productive direction.

## 21 [ffgfan on April 30, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46031-disapointed-with-this/?do=findComment&comment=461439)

I would love to write a game session breakdown but I got the game more then a week ago from now and don't remeber it that good.

After a lot of playing I can say one more thing - comparing it to Invasion. When I got the core set for W:I I had a lot more fun with it. And about LOTR LCG core set - I got bored after a couple of plays. The only thing why I still tried it was wthe fact that my firend wanted to try it.

Oh, there's no more thing I don't like - the massive part of the game is luck. When You are lucky enought for the first two rounds You could draw in the encounter only treachery or location cards and that gives You a lot of advantage.

The way I see it  - The game is good but I like a lot better Invasion from this one. Becouse here the luck play a large part of the game.

But that's only my opinion after more then a week of playtesting it.

I will say it like this - I will put this game on my shelf and the game will wait for better times I hope. And by better time I mean after the first cycle of Adventure pack I will think if I want to play it more.

@Calexander - anwsers: yes, yes, yes, yes. And it's not that I don't like it only becouse I beat it in first play but the main reason is the part that luck play in it. I think that one of the reasons why i beat the game in first play was the fact that I got very lucky. For example - in the second scenarion on Anduin in two first rounds I got in the encounter one treachery and after it one location. So I got time to kill the hill troll. Or in the third when I escaped from Dol Guldur the shadow cards on objective cards were treachery, location and only one enemy. So the main reason why I'm disapointed with this game is the large part of luck in play.

@Mestrahd - that's one of the main rules of the game, You can not miss that. Don't You think?

@Conykchameleon - 1) I know that and that one of the main rule, can't miss that. I use Eowin to play cards like Gandalf or from Spirit sphere. 2) and yes.

So sorry but I'm leaveng the community of this game.

Maybe such a cooperative game like this is not the kind I want to play. This kind of cooperative game is not for me becouse I don't have to much fun playing it. I will stay with such tiltes like W:I in card games, that gives me more pleasure playing it.

So goodbye to all! And have fun with this game,

Best regards

Conyk,

I just noticed that I've been committing one of the mistakes you mentioned. When I leave an attack undefended, I've been assigning all damage to one CHARACTER. But if you say it's supposed to be a hero, that makes things much more difficult.

## 23 [conykchameleon on April 30, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46031-disapointed-with-this/?do=findComment&comment=461445)

Mestrahd: Yeah it is supposed to be a hero. And while I had the rule down from the beginning it took me a while to figure out how straegically poor leaving an attack undefended is. And yeah, it does make it A LOT harder. lol

Apparently we did lol

Anyways, I will say one thing before this thread dies a deserved death: I do agree that, right now, there is a lot of luck in the game. That being said the game is brand spanking new, and companies always have a few growing pains before a game hits its stride. Hell, ffgfan mentioned Warhammer: Invasion, which just has barely hit it's stride after a couple of years of major imbalance problems. I think once we see the first cycle of adventure packs they will start to balance quests better and there will be much more strategy in terms of deckbuilding.

## 25 [guciomir on April 30, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46031-disapointed-with-this/?do=findComment&comment=461454)

Warhammer, MTG etc involve more.luck than LOTR LCG. Both in WH and MTG we do not know what opponent will we face, while in LOTR LCG enemy is fixed, so we are free to prepare

Well said.This game just came out and this is the core set.Is like an introduction to the game so we must wait the future adventure packs and then we can say if this game is good or bad.

Sorry for asking this here and i know that there is a faq thread but can someone tell me what huppens wen a trichery card is revealed in combat fase as a hidden shadow card?You resolve the wen revealed text or you ignore it

Leaving with only the core set released is beyond silly. That is like playing a game or two of MTG with just duel decks and then packing it up. You only get a glimpse, a "taste", of the game. Even playing W:I with just core set got old after a month or so. Same with AGoT, after a while you get used to the decks and the cards in them. With more cards will come a greater variety.

Only the Shadow text resolves. If no shadow text, nothing at all happens.

And before he could enlighten us about his amazing techniques. Honestly, I would have loved to read some more details about how he made it. I still give him the benefit of the doubt, which seems it might stay for ever now that he left us.

 

Definitely not the game for him, I guess.

 

@Servant of the secret fire : When resolving shadow effects ignore everything but the shadow effect. I believe I got that pretty clear watching the introductory videos, if I remember correctly.

I'm disappointed, too. Sorry, but I cannot believe such an outrageous claim without some solid particulars. He says he had a couple of rounds to wait on the troll. But the heroes he mentions have a combined threat of 29. You don't have a couple of rounds before the troll engages. One, at best. You could use The Galadhrin's Greeting to reduce threat, but that's a 3 cost card. With only Eowyn and no resource engine on this deck, that is impossible, Gandalf is even more expensive and can't be played right away because Sneak Attack doesn't fit in the deck. How are you preventing the troll from engaging? Not only that, it is very difficult to muster the attack power to kill the troll, again without a resource battery. Maybe you can use Feints and Gondorian Spearman to hold off and on another round damage the troll. But how many cards can you play in a couple of turns? And quest? And kill the troll quickly?

Personally, it sounds like he skipped something important and won't admit to it from embarrassment. And now, he is leaving the game because it is "too easy". I apologize if I'm being a troll myself, but, honestly, I feel like my intelligence has been insulted.   

## 33 [Oshio on April 30, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46031-disapointed-with-this/?do=findComment&comment=461516)

It happens in every game. A powerful deck comes along and someone says 'I can beat that easily with this and this and this," and as soon as the questions start piling up they clam up. It's not a big deal, I recognize the guy from the Warhammer forums and he's similar over there. Best we just move on and work on strategy amongst ourselves. I myself love this game to death and think there is already a lot of strategy. I'm personally looking forward to FFG dropping a few more scenarios online using the combinations of cards we've already got, in particular some difficult scenarios designed for solo play.

I would love to write a game session breakdown but I got the game more then a week ago from now and don't remeber it that good.

After a lot of playing I can say one more thing - comparing it to Invasion. When I got the core set for W:I I had a lot more fun with it. And about LOTR LCG core set - I got bored after a couple of plays. The only thing why I still tried it was wthe fact that my firend wanted to try it.

Oh, there's no more thing I don't like - the massive part of the game is luck. When You are lucky enought for the first two rounds You could draw in the encounter only treachery or location cards and that gives You a lot of advantage.

The way I see it  - The game is good but I like a lot better Invasion from this one. Becouse here the luck play a large part of the game.

But that's only my opinion after more then a week of playtesting it.

I will say it like this - I will put this game on my shelf and the game will wait for better times I hope. And by better time I mean after the first cycle of Adventure pack I will think if I want to play it more.

@Calexander - anwsers: yes, yes, yes, yes. And it's not that I don't like it only becouse I beat it in first play but the main reason is the part that luck play in it. I think that one of the reasons why i beat the game in first play was the fact that I got very lucky. For example - in the second scenarion on Anduin in two first rounds I got in the encounter one treachery and after it one location. So I got time to kill the hill troll. Or in the third when I escaped from Dol Guldur the shadow cards on objective cards were treachery, location and only one enemy. So the main reason why I'm disapointed with this game is the large part of luck in play.

@Mestrahd - that's one of the main rules of the game, You can not miss that. Don't You think?

@Conykchameleon - 1) I know that and that one of the main rule, can't miss that. I use Eowin to play cards like Gandalf or from Spirit sphere. 2) and yes.

So sorry but I'm leaveng the community of this game.

Maybe such a cooperative game like this is not the kind I want to play. This kind of cooperative game is not for me becouse I don't have to much fun playing it. I will stay with such tiltes like W:I in card games, that gives me more pleasure playing it.

So goodbye to all! And have fun with this game,

Best regards

Hi everyone,

 

I played my first game of LotR:LCG last night with a friend of mine, and was pretty happy with how the game works.

Maybe slightly too easy indeed; believe it or not, but my friend and I defeated scenario 1 and 2 with the starting 30-card decks. I used the Energy sphere deck, he used the "leader" one (the purple one, I have the game in french, so dunno what Commandement has been translated from ^^).

We got lucky with a very good timing of Gandalfs (which made us laugh a bit, "A wizard is never late, nor is he early", blah blah :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] ) who helped us finish each step in the second scenario.

I enjoyed the game a lot and cannot wait for the Adventure Packs!

 You said you used 2 spirit decks, yet Gimli and Legolas are Tactics heroes. You can only pay for card with resource tokens from the same sphere; so spirit cards have to be paid by heroes within the spirit sphere; you can't combine tactics resources and spirit resources to pay for a spirit card. 

## 42 [Entropy42 on May 1, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46031-disapointed-with-this/?do=findComment&comment=461843)

Personally, I'm disappointed with the amount of luck in this game, and I really disagree that luck is a greater factor in W:I.  In this game, getting a string of non-effectual treachery cards can hand you the game.  Getting nothing but locations will usually make you lose if you aren't playing Northern Tracker (conversely the game is very easy if this happens and you are).  Getting Caught in the Web during setup or turn 1 of the 3rd scenario is pretty much game over, etc.

The thing I've always liked about card games (vs dice rolling) is while there is always a random element, at least if you get screwed/lucky with card draw, you know that card won't be coming up again.  In dice randomness, you can just roll low all game and lose regardless of how good/bad your strategy is.  This game is the same way.  If all the hard locations/enemies/treacheries come up as shadow cards, you got the card out of the way and you didn't even have to suffer its effect.  Basically the difficulty is a very wide range just based on what you draw.  Hopefully this will be mitigated somehow with future cards, but it seems to me that its more like a core part of the game. 

The second thing that is disappointing is the way they scaled difficulty for multiplayer.  To me, its baffling.  Why make a card like the 2nd step of the 2nd scenario. "reveal 1 additional card each quest phase"  Why wouldn't that be "reveal 1 additional card PER PLAYER each quest phase"?  That makes the game roughly twice as hard in solo play, buy only 25% harder in a 4 player game.  I played two 4 player games this weekend, both times I was teaching 2 new players and playing with only the stock decks.  We absolutely stomped the 1st scenario in 4 turns in the first game, and beat the 2nd scenario with a combined score of 100.  No one's hero had damage at the end of the game, and we had about 10 allies in play. 

Yes, this is easily fixed.  I can just make house rules that the quest cards all scale linearly based on the # of players.  I just don't understand why this wasn't done to begin with.  The power of the party scales linearly with # of players, and maybe even slightly better than that (I would say 2 players are more than twice as powerful as a single player).

Playing with the smaller 30 card decks makes the game much easier.  Build the 50 card decks you're supposed to play with and try it again.  It's very easy to draw into your power cards with only 30 cards in the deck (and a free mulligan that can be used to maximize your chances to draw power cards).    

 

I've seen many people talking about how easy the game is, but so far several of those people have admitted to using the 30 card decks and the ones who haven't admitted to using the smaller decks have clammed up about what they are playing with.  I'm not attacking you, so don't take this post the wrong way, people just need to be playing by the full rules, and the not the beginner rules, before going on forums and telling everyone how easy the game is.  The game might be a bit too easy ATM, but it's not nearly as easy as some people are making it out to be.  

 

Personally I'm waiting for my friends to all get their own cards so that we can play with four optimized decks instead of four decks made all from my stuff which is stretched a bit thin for that many decks (even with three core sets).  After that I'll have a full grasp on the difficulty of the game.

While I agree with you Koz, it is important to point out that building a team of 4, tournament legal, 50 card decks is very difficult from just the Core Set, and actually will probably be for some time. Since you only have 12 heroes, and there are not enough cards from each sphere to make a 50 card mono, it would be an incredibly tricky process to build 4 viable dual-sphere decks.

Of course, that's the point.  It makes it more difficult.  All that you posted is something I'm well aware of, obviously, since I mentioned that I used three core sets to build four 50 card decks.  That's part of the current challenge of the game.  Future expansions will add new cards that will make deck building easier, to be sure, but they will also add more challenges.  Hopefully the challenges added will keep pace with the new options added to players.  

 

Until that time though, 50 card decks are the rule for a standard game, not an optional self-imposed challenge that you can choose to use or not use.   The beginner decks are just that: decks made for beginners learning the game.  After playing the game a time or two, you are clearly supposed to build full decks.  

 

As I said in my previous post, I'm not trying to attack anyone, I've just been noticing there are some people that are talking about how easy the game is, yet many of those people are using 30 card decks.  It's a little like playing a video game, putting it on easy mode, then talking about how you beat the game without breaking a sweat.  Well, no duh!  

People need to play the game with the full rules before telling other people how easy or not easy it is.  Seems self-evident really.  That being said, like I mentioned in my earlier post, the game might be too easy right now.  I won't know for sure until my friends all have their own stuff and build optimal 50 card decks.

If you have 2 core sets and you are 4 people don't play all together.Make 2 teams create 4 decks choose a scenario and play competitive its a lot more fun.

Me and my friends we do that and we enjoy the game a lot.Trying to create a deck and do a better score than your friends is grate and forces you to think new and better decks for a better score.

As for me i enjoy solo play a lot and i prefer wen i am home to play this game than just chat on internet or play an online game.

ps:As i said before this is  only the core set and i see it more like an introduction to the game.Future adventure packs will show how good/bad easy/hard this game is.

If you play with one color per player, it is a cooperative game that is balanced with 2 players, and far too easy on a 3 or 4 players games. The solo game is real hard but rely to much on (un)lucky draws.

@ffgfan, you might try to play 2 colors per player on a 2 players game, then you've got everything that game has to offer plus you need to manage you ressources and to wisely select your team of heroes. Playing that way, I really enjoyed the game.

I'm sorry, but I think I agree with everyone else... Either you're playing wrong or I am. River Anduin quest, I just essentially lost in three turns. Troll came out with Misty Mountain Goblins at setup. Therefore, I did not send Eowyn on quest in order to eliminate Gobs. During quest, ANOTHER Misty Mountain Goblin came our, so I was attacked by all three monsters first round since I could not send Eowyn (threat increased to 30 prior to Encounter round). Eliminated first Gobs, but then ANOTHER goblin engaged the next round. So, three gobs & Troll vs my team. Gimli took two blows from Troll thanks to armor, and no progress on quest since I had two enemies that needed to be eliminated and then third gobs swarmed. Eowyn killed second round, Gimli will be killed third. Legolas the next round.

I don't see how it is possible to complete River Anduin quest solo unless you get EXTREMELY lucky in your draws and the encounter deck.

But, I still wanted to say, I find that second quest to be impossible thus far. More tinkering to be done I guess.

Absolutely 100% agree.  i cannot tell you how many people i have heard say how easy and how you need only a starter set to play the game and win it.  People are soon going to realise they will need multiple sets to build the correct 50 card decks so they aren't full of junk.

Oh and the OP obviously just watched someone play the game and never played it.  This game played correctly with 50 card decks is tough as **** and i love it that way. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

this might be a bit off-topic, but I was just wondering how easy it is to "forget" rules and play the game wrong especially if you play solo. Player that are eager to play might just read the rules and start playing. Without double checking later on (e.g. because everything goes smoothly) there might some things be forgotten, e.g. resource matching or shadow cards, as in solo-play there is no one to remind you of the rules you forget. Thus, the game might turn out to be fairly easy for some players, resulting in a quick loss of interest. And that would be real shame....since I personally like the game a lot, despite the luck factor and its difficulty.

So even if ffg sells a lot of core sets...I wonder if there is a substantial number of players that put the game in the shelf to be covered in dust. I don't even say that forgeting rules is very bad, on the contraire, I can see how it is fairly obvious to forget about some of the stuff and I think it might be a real threat to the overall success of the game concept.

I found I forget to raise my threat by 1 every refresh phase when playing solo >.<

That said I dont think that people finding the game easy and giving up is a real danger. Firstly I think its worth pointing out that even though the game's solo play is a great selling point the fact that its so easy to get others to join in (just give them a deck and scale up the encounters) and since the quests (especially the 3rd) in the box are designed to work better in multiplayer there will always be a very strong multiplayer following.
On top of that I dont think that easier play experiences are necisarily a bad thing, for instance there was a player on the forums a few days ago who plays with the house rule of the Questing phase being optional. This dramatically reduces the difficulty of the game but hes having a ball with it regardless! I think there will be very few people who will honestly drop the game because they missread a rule, the same could be sad for any game at the end of the day.

"reveal 1 additional card each quest phase"  Why wouldn't that be "reveal 1 additional card PER PLAYER each quest phase"?  That makes the game roughly twice as hard in solo play, buy only 25% harder in a 4 player game.  I played two 4 player games this weekend, both times I was teaching 2 new players and playing with only the stock decks.  We absolutely stomped the 1st scenario in 4 turns in the first game, and beat the 2nd scenario with a combined score of 100.  No one's hero had damage at the end of the game, and we had about 10 allies in play. 

Yes, this is easily fixed.  I can just make house rules that the quest cards all scale linearly based on the # of players.  I just don't understand why this wasn't done to begin with.  The power of the party scales linearly with # of players, and maybe even slightly better than that (I would say 2 players are more than twice as powerful as a single player).



I agree. As things are right now, the game has some serious scalability issues. It makes me wonder how the playtesting was done. Did they only ever try it with two players?

I think they'll have to revise a couple of rules to turn this into a game that works well no matter how many players there are. More careful quest design will help somewhat, but I don't believe it can fix all of the inherent issues (like  the surge mechanism).

We are trying a few differemt things to toughen it up a little:

1. At 3 players we dish out 4 cards on the quest, 4 players we dish out 6 cards.  We found in a couple of games late that we would produce enough Willpower to knock out  heaps of progress markers is we coordinated ourselves so that was the idea to take the edge off those big numbers

2. We all play Dual Sphere decks now.  Still just with the starters at the moment but it means that resource management gets flagged earlier and is more limiting.  For us, when more heroes get released, this is where it will be so we are doing it now.  So far so good

I find this argument really strange.  When I said, "we beat everything easily with the stock decks" I meant that to indicate that we beat the scenarios with relatively weak decks.  You don't think that tuned 50 card decks will be better than the 30 card stock decks?  Yes, if it was legal to build a 30 card deck it would clearly be better than a built 50 card deck.  But I don't exactly get to draw my "power cards" all the time with a 30 card deck, as I have only 1 or 2 of those cards in the deck, since I'm limited to 1 core set.  Each deck has only 1 Gandalf, for example.  If I built a 50 card deck, it would probably have 3 of him.  Making my chance to draw him go up by 80%.  Same with some of the powerful attachments that are single or double copies in the core set.  I'm really just surprised to hear someone say that the stock decks should be considered overpowered.  I have been figuring that it would be *better* to have a legit deck composed of 3 core sets and 1-2 spheres.  The session reports of people doing quest 3 solo seem to bear this out, as no one seems to be able to beat it with a pre-con, but some have had success with constructed 50 card decks.

Regardless, even if my decks were just 3 of every card released so far, the 4 player scenarios would be really easy and still not scale with the number of players.

I like the rule Carnivean mentioned, where they reveal 4 cards when they have 3 players and 6 when they have 4.  That would probably make it a good challenge.

I get the feeling that people that mentioned 30 card decks, meant built up 30 card decks with the extra Gandalfs and extra staple cards, not the stock 30 card starters. I don't think any of the starters stands much of a chance against the 2nd or 3rd quest on it's own.
