i remember the fight alot of us had with HFG, so do you think with it being a big box and near christmas FFG will print more?

I guess, FFG will announce Khazad-dum on Friday for next week, everything else would not make sense if they wanna sell it for x-mas.

I dont think that FFG can change the number of printed copies at this time anymore (for example food industry starts producing their x-mas stuff just after Eastern). It depends what decision they made this summer for Khazad-Dum: print it as often as the core set or print it in similar numbers as the APs... if its the latter case, it will be annoying as the usual AP-hunt I'm afraid
