When text on a card reffers to "Current quest card" it means to take action on the current quest card, even there is an active lcation in play?

If the effect is about placing progress, then it depends on the type of the card: progress placed by a player card is diverted onto the active location, but progress placed by an encounter card goes straight on the quest. If the effect is about anything else, such as removing progress, then it affects the quest card not the active location.

Note a particular special case: if a player card attempts to place progress on the current quest but the active location is "Immune to player card effects" then the progress fails to be placed. No, I don't think it makes sense either.
