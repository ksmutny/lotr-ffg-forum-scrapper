Is it possible to use Song of mocking the same way as Dori response to protect Beorn (Hero) from taking damage.

 

Beorn (THOHaUH5)

Sentinel. Cannot have attachments.
Immune to player card effects.
Beorn does not exhaust to defend

 

Song of mocking (SoM99)

Action: Exhuast Song of Mocking to choose another hero. Until the end of the phase, attached hero takes all damage assigned to the chosen hero.

 

Dori (THOHaUH9)

Response: After a hero is assigned any amount of damage, exhaust Dori to place that damage on Dori instead.

 

FAQ:

Q: Can I use Dori (OHUH 9) to prevent damage from being assigned to Beorn (OHUH 5), even though Beorn is immune to player card effects?
A: Yes. Dori’s Response targets the damage being assigned, not the character it is being assigned to, so Beorn’s immunity does not factor.

No, you can't.... "Exhuast Song of Mocking to choose another hero" , This targets the hero, and he can not be the target of card effects.

 

BUT... you can use Dori and then use Mocking to move the damage form Dori to another hero... ccccccccOMBO!

My doubts are casue Beorn is "immune to player cards effects". So being a target is a card effect too?

This is surely an effect: "Until the end of the phase, attached hero takes all damage assigned to the chosen hero."

 

First sentence inform what is the target (Beorn isn't immune to being tageted)

Second sentence is an effect on witch Beorn is immune but effect applies for damage not for bear.

> Beorn isn't immune to being tageted

Yes, he is. This is part of what the designer want in the "immune" package.

Then again, what we know is that :

you can target his resources, you can target the damages he take, you can declare attack with quick strike against an immune enemy, location that are immune cannot receive token from northen tracker nor legolas.

So the "immune" package is quite different from other cards game.
