## 1 [PsychoRocka on August 11, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/184799-unique-ally-championship-2015/?do=findComment&comment=1730389)

Presenting the Unique Ally Championship 2015!

The heroes championship we usually see each year on the forums is so fun and interesting that I decided to do one for unique allies while we wait for Across the Ettenmoors to arrive.

 

This tournament includes unique allies up to and from Land of Shadow and Escape from Mount Gram. Whilst I probably should have done so, there is no seeding and all starting positions are completely random. I would rather allies of different costs and spheres go up against each other to make the choices harder. I think it will force people to make choices that take in every aspect and potential benefit of each ally rather than just deciding who is the best 4 cost ally, 3 cost etc and having the winners face each other.

 

Vote for your favorite ally as they enter their match-ups in the comments below. Vote on whatever criteria you desire. You are free to discuss anything you wish but all votes will be counted just once and CANNOT be changed once I record them.

 

Voting will close at the end of each week for each bracket. Fifth Round Semi Finals voting has begun and ends on Sunday 13th 11.59PM (GMT +10). If you need to look any allies up to remind yourself of exactly what they do Hall of Beorn is the best place to do so:

As a strong fan of Gildor, i must say it is pretty annoying that you have him battle against that nameless filthy stinky wizard whose name i cannot even speak in middle earth .... I suspect a plot from Sauron here, anyway, i will vote later and make three hundred twenty one fake accounts to clear this matter .... :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Farmer Maggot for the win! Besides him being one of the most extreme characters in the books (telling off a Nazgul, sneaking Frodo to the ferry in the fog, keeping what look like wolves as pets, and casually strolling through the Old Forest to name a few), the flavor of the card is that he is sticking his massive dogs on people.

A vote for Farmer Maggot is a vote for mushrooms!

A - Eomund - Awesome in a Rohan deck, and the only ally besides Gandalf that I ever use with Sneak Attack.

B - Elfhelm - One of the stronger spirit allies, good in a Rohan or Caldara deck.  Eagles still don't seem very playable, despite Gwaihir's tiny crown.

C - Farmer Maggot - I like the idea of Rumil, but he's too expensive to play in a silvan deck.  Farmer Maggot wins for being a hobbit.

D - Brok Ironfist - Only because I actually used his ability once several years ago.  And because I know he's going to lose.

E - Arwen - No contest.  I'm glad we are getting a non-terrible version of Damrod.

F - Guthlaf - Because I like the Rohan/Gondor synergy and I like saying his name.

G - Hama - Great defender potential.  Also, the leadership version of Anborn is far less playable than the lore version.

H - Gleowine - Good, repeatable card draw.

I - Kili - Everyone loves playing the Fili/Kili combo.

J - Treebeard - He has the potential to win it all.  Plus, the Mablung ally pales in comparison to Mablung hero.

K - Gandalf - Very tough matchup because Faramir ally is also very good.  But OHUH Gandalf can be a total beast.

L - Bilbo - So good for fetching Hobbit Pipes, which is one of my favorite decks.  Meanwhile, Quickbeam is OP.

M - Legolas - The best attacking ally in the game.  Erestor is also pretty good.

N - Boromir - With a little healing, you can often get 2 or 3 actions out of him every turn.  Poor Radagast desperately needs a reboot.

O - Anborn - Bring on the trap deck!

P - Emery - So good in mono spirit.  Plus, you can play her on other people.  Skinbark is also good, but Booming Ents will often be attacking for more and cost less.

Q - Bill the Pony - Bombur ally is terrible, and Bill plays for free.  What's not to like?

R - Gandalf - Gildor is good, too, but I never seem to play him anymore because of his cost.  Meanwhile, Gandalf is playable in almost every deck.

Ok, here we go

 

A: Eomund, cause I have used him in Rohan decks while have never played Forlong

B: Gwaihir, tough but I am more of a tactic player and use a lot of eagles

C: Farmer Maggot, he can kick Nazgul in their butt 

D: Ingold, I've always though Brok to be a useless card

E: Arwen, she is very helpfull in quest and defence

F: Guthlaf, cause I play more Rohan than dwarves

G: Hama, have used him and helped me a lot in Helms Deep

H: Gloin, nice Leadership Dwarf ally

I: Kili, cause you get Fili

J: Treebeard, but Mablung Ally is in the first age custom cards I think

K: Faramir offcourse

L: Quickbeam, used him a lot recently and liked him

M: Legolas, he is ranged and draws a card, with his horse he is even better

N: Radagast, cause he can bring more eagles ... ok he is expensive but he is an Istari after all

O: Anborn, I like his ability

P: Skinbark, do not have him yet but I know I will love him

Q: Bill the Pony, does it need an explanation ? 

R: Gildor, who cares about the stinky wizard, Gildor is a mystery of his own

A.  Eomund, since Forlong is only useful in Outlands and they don't need help

B.  Elfhelm, his threat-lowering is useful in all sorts of quests

C.  Rumil, both direct-damage effects can miss, but Rumil's more powerful on the table

D.  Ingold, since Brok Ironfist manages to be both expensive and useless

E.  Arwen, only $2, buffs a defender while questing for 2, insanely useful.

F.  Guthlaf, since his discount is available immediately and Bifur's bonus needs 5 dwarves.

G.  Hama.  Double defense at 5D is worth the discard

H.  Gleowine.  Cheap repeatable card draw that can be used on another player.

I. Bofur (S).  Love being able to keep him in play for 1, when that can be managed

J.  Treebeard.  Awesome stats and ent-readier.

K.  Faramir.  Post-staging massive willpower booster.

L.  Quickbeam.  Fantastic value and lacks the usual ent delay.

M. Legolas.  Ranged, 3 attack, and card draw in tactics.

N.  Boromir.  Radagast is too limited, though if he could be used on Ents it'd be different.

O.  Anborn.  More important to a traps deck than Dwalin is to a dwarf deck.

P.  Skinbark.  Love the ents, and orc-killers are useful in many quests.

Q.  Bill the Pony.  Free with Sam and gives hobbits what they need.

R.  Gandalf.  Always gives you what you need, and awesome with Sneak Attack

There were some pretty intense first round match-ups:
Rumil vs. Farmer Maggot for similar effects. Rumil won for me since he scales better in the part of the game I expect to play him in.
Gandalf (OHaUH) vs. Faramir. Both are questing powerhouses, but Gandalf can shore up multiple weaknesses of a deck on his own, spheres be damned!
Erestor vs. Legolas. Again, both let you see more cards. I went Erestor since I still rather have Hero Legolas much of the time.
Gildor vs. Gandalf (Core). Gildor has solid stats or a great ability to use turn after turn. Gandalf is still solid, but I like my allies to stick around longer if they cost 5 (even considering Sneak Attack).

No worries, PsychoRocka. Just go ahead and award Gamling the Honorable Mention trophy for archetype-building. He is amazing in the latest incarnation of the Rohan "leaves play" deck.

Hah!

Not a bad matchup there, though. I tend to use Fili more, since between using Dain and Leadership's usual resource generation, I find it easier to field the 3 cost for him quickly. But arguably maybe Kili is more valuable *because* he gets you two-for-one in a less resource-rich sphere? Dunno.

You could always lump Fili and Kili together and then have Gamling replace Fili on AD.

A- Eomund - As much as I love Forlong the Fat, I just never can get his ability to work.

B- Gwaihir! - I don't really like Elfhelm... And against the lord of the Eagles??? No brainer.

C- Farmer Maggot - Very tough decision, as Rumil is one of my favorites. But I rarely play either, unfortunately. So Farmer it is!

D- Brok Ironfist - Can't betray our roots. This Ingold.... He's too new. I'm suspicious of him...

E- Arwen - Sorry Damrod, but you got your own hero, and Arwen doesn't yet. And Arwen's just better anyway.

F- Bifur - Very awesome in Dwarf decks. Sorry Guthlaf. We had some good laughs.  ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

G- Anborn (Le) - I do like Hama, but sometimes I find his ability useless.

H- Gloin - I really like Dwarves.

I- Bofur - Sorry Kili and Fili...

J- Treebeard - Ents vs. Rangers. Ents will always win.

K- Faramir - I'm voting against Wizards... Mostly.

L- Quickbeam - Ents always win.

M- Legolas - No contest. I do like Erestor... But not as much as I like being rewarded for slaughtering orcs.

N- Boromir - Tough decision. I had to betray the Eagles on this one.

O- Dwalin - Anborn is already got my vote.

P- Skinbark - Ents always win.

Q- BILL THE PONY - No explanation necessary.

R- Gildor -I'll give him my vote. But I'm rooting for Landroval, so whichever one is fine with me!

 

Good job doing this. This was a fun aspect of last year, I hope we'll get to see another hero one soon.

Kili/Fili are now a team and Gamling has replaced Fili. Edit your votes if need be. Everything will be counted at the end of the week so no harm.

A - Eomund - his special ability is a game saver

 

B - Gwaihir - I don't like both of them, but Elfhelm is a bit more useless

 

C - Rumil - has 2 WP and is tactics

 

D - Ingold - never played with him, but I bet he doesn't suck as much as Brok

 

E - Arwen - no surprise here

 

F - Guthlaf - is in most of my tactics decks, a solid and cheap character who can help with WP and DEF

 

G - Hama - haven't played with Anborn yet

 

H - Gloin - there are enough (an better) ways to increase your card draw, which makes Gleowine less valuable

 

I - Bofur - I like his ability a lot!

 

J - Treebeard - he is so good that I never played the hero version

 

K - Faramir - this guy doesn't raise your threat while being awesome

 

L - Quickbeam - cheap way to get some WP or attack

 

M -Legolas - didn't like him at the beginning, but his ability and attachments are just great

 

N - Radagast - Boromir is great, but a bit too expensive for my taste

 

O - Dwalin - Anborn can be great, but the fact that you have to exhaust him is a downer

 

P - Emery - because there a re aleady better (Booming) Ents out there

 

Q - Bombur Bill the Pony - again: 2 WP and tactics = awesome combo! cause I love Sam?

 

R - Gildor - he is great; Gandalf is Gandalf is Gandalf and shouldn't be in this competition

Love these tournaments. My picks:

 

A - Eomund - Forlong is good for Outlands decks, but I don't play Outlands much and Rohan is on the rise.

B - Gwaihir - Honestly, neither one gets to the table much, but I like how Gwaihir fits into the Eagle deck.

C - Farmer Maggot - Rumil is probably objectively better, but my sentimental vote is for Farmer Maggot.

D - Ingold - Do I need to say why?

E - Arwen - No-brainer.

F - Bifur - Tough one. Guthlaf is a good utility piece while Bifur is amazing, but the Dwarf deck already has an embarrassment of riches. I'll give the nod to pure power.

G - Hama - I'm a sucker for a good defensive piece.

H - Gleowine - Card draw that can fit into any deck wins vs. resource generation for a single trait.

I - Kili/Fili - Bofur can be good, and I don't use Kili/Fili as much these days, but they can lead to a big swing.

J - Treebeard - He's just so good  when he hits the table.

K - Faramir - Tough one as OHaUH Gandalf can win a game by himself, but Faramir is just a pure staple.

L - Quickbeam - One of the best allies in the game in terms of stats for the cost.

M - Legolas - What a huge battle. 4-cost Elves that bring card draw to their spheres. Ultimately, the ranged keyword tips the scales for me.

N - Boromir - No contest.

O - Anborn - Sentimental choice to give trap decks some love and will be much better with Leadership Faramir hero.

P - Emery - Skinbark is great, don't get me wrong, but I've used Emery a ton and a free ally with decent stats is huge.

Q - Bill the Pony - Bill for the win!

R - Gandalf - Tough one, but Gandalf just has so much utility, even if I don't use him as much anymore.

A - Forlong. Troll pick, all hail Forlong the fat!

B - Elfhelm. As awesome as Gwaihir is, Elfhelm just provides a lot of utility with ability and stats. Eagles need some rejuvenation

C - Rumil. Nice ability that fits within the archetype, ranged, a lot to like.

D - Ingold. Doesnt matter I havent even used him yet, he's going against the worst ally in the game.

E - Arwen. She didnt get a bye? Really?

F - Guthlaf. Bifur is better for sure, but i've always liked Guthlaf...if only for saying his name.

G - Hama. This was a tough call, mostly because I dont have much experience with either. Hama's safety net ability wins it here

H - Gloin. Never really like Gleowine.  Not sure why, maybe this is why I dont win more often

I - Kili/Fili.  I like the twin mechanic with them. Bofur is probably better but whatever

J - Treebeard. Whoever doesnt pick Treebeard has clearly never played Treebeard

K - Faramir. Really tough call here, Faramir is one of my fav characters and best allies.  Gandalf so good but threat limits him

L - Quickbeam.  Another tough call since Bilbo is quite useful, but of all the OP ents, Quickbeam is arguably the most OP

M - Legolas. Havent even gotten him out in play yet, but its Legolas so he wins.

N - Boromir.  Havent used him much, but when I have he's been a powerhouse.

O - Anborn. Its a trap.

P - Skinbark.  Played with him a good deal tonight actually.  Dude is an absolute moster.

Q - Bill the Pony.  I'm riding Bill to the finals (pun intended)

R - Gildor. Tough call. My avi vs what could be considered the frontrunner. Going with the underdog

Keen-Eyed Took is worse than Brok, at least Brok has useful stats if he ever does hit the table.

Nice thread!

 

I think sometimes it's hard to call a winner, since some allies are huge in specialised decks, whereas others are more generally useful but not so great. Well, I guess I'll go with personal feelings, mostly.

 

A-Eomund, out of sympathy for poor Rohan vs Outlands.

B-Gwaihir, actually a nice card if not for the fact most eagles are so **** expensive. Still a lot of fun with Eagles of the Misty Mountains.

C-Rumil, nice when you can pull the trick off and hit for 4+ direct damage. :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

D-Brok Iron--- not really, Ingold. :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

E-Arwen, the most powerful unique ally IMO.

F-Guthlaf. Actually Bifur is better but Bifur hero is very good so ally has less chances of seeing play in MP.

G-Hama. Much more efficient, even if Anborn looks very interesting, especially paired with Thalin. 3 cost vs 4 cost is the tiebreaker here.

H-Gleowine. Hard call; Gloin, while still being very good, is not essential to dwarves, whereas Gleowine might help in difficult situations.

I-Bofur. Great ally, helps the most when you need it the most.

J-Treebeard. Awesome ally: huge combat buff for every non-tactics deck and action advantage too.

K-Faramir. Gandalf needs a deck to be built upon him, and I'm not a fan of that concept, whereas Faramir is just so good...

L-Quickbeam. Bilbo is a very good ally, but Quickbeam has fantastic stats, providing a huge buff to every deck that plays Lore.

M-Legolas. Not a fan of Erestor; Lego gives mono Tactics a new option.

N-Boromir. Don't like either, but Radagast just sucks so..

O-Anborn, in hopes that Trap decks will become viable with new Damrod hero (and it really looks like they could).

P-Emery, hands down. Sure, she requires Monospirit, but she's arguably the best in-sphere defender considering her cost.

Q-Bill the Pony. Free ally, hard to argue with that - same above.

R-Gandalf. Poor Gildor; Gandalf is not a staple with the current pool, but he's still one of the best allies available.

S - Galadriel, she has a nice ability and can be very usefull with Sneak Attack

T - Rumil, this was tough as I use Elfhelm quite often, but Rumil is a very good tactics ally and in a Silvan deck with other Ranged characters he has a deadly ability

U - Saruman, he is a very strong character, even for one turn

V - Henamarth, I vote him for two reasong. Firstly most people will go to Arwen (who I also like and use a lot), secondly, I play mostly solo and he can be a winner when on table with his ability

W - Haldir, very strong character

X - Gimli, great ally card, he can quest and fight the same turn as long as an enemy appears

Y - Elrond, especially with the new condition cards he can be very usefull

Z - Orophin, cause I use Elves more than dwarves

AA - Treebeard, no need to comment on that

AB - Faramir, great ability

AC - Legolas, I find him of much more use

AD - Boromir, again I find he has more uses, but I am a tactics player also

AE - Anborn, mainly for his ability and also being a strong Lore attacker

AF - Skinbark, very tough, but I think that 6 resources are too much for Beorn

AG - Bill the Pony, because he is a Pony

AH - Gandalf, cause the stinky wizard won Gildor, thus if he reaches the final it will mean that Gildor was against a tough opponent

S - Eomund: it may be cause of Galadriel is unique and she also can be hero card

T - Rumil: very fun when he kills any annoying enemy. And it is not so hard than seems.

U - Saruman: Ingold still i dont know how he runs, and Saruman can be give players a very curious games and happy moments

V - Arwen: hard choice! I love Henamanth, he has very good power and effects

W - Haldir: hard choice! To me both are bad anyway. ^^

X - Hama: Hama is more playable than Gimli i think, both allies are still too new

H - Elrond: he is more versatile, however, if game is very long, could be better Gleo

I - Bofur. of course, Orophin must be played only inside a very dedicated silvan decks

AA - Treebeard: it is a lot of more versatile than Barliman, Treebeard can be played in all decks, Barliman only in a very few

AB - Faramir!: hard choice, Quickbeam is very very good ally, but Faramir is more ^^

AC - Legolas: grrrrr i voted for Erestor last time, instead Legolas, but Lego is bettr than Denethor ally

AD - Boromir: the times i have played Boromir ally is fun, when you reach to trigger all his effects (i also voted for Radagast last time ^^)

AE - Bofur: i play him very well, i dont know why other players dont like him. I find him very usefull

AF - Beorn: i hate Skinbark, it won Emery.... grrrr!

AG - Dori: when Dori is in game, everybody breath with more calm

S - Eomund - I like the idea of Galadriel, but in practice she has never worked for me.  Meanwhile, Eomund can be a game changer.

T - Elfhelm - Similar to Galadriel, Rumil just never seems to be worth it for me.  Elfhelm isn't flashy, but a solid spirit ally that lacks combat strength.

U - Ingold - Saruman seems pretty much unplayable, but I've never actually used him.  Ingold is unproven but has potential.

V - Arwen - Henamarth is solid, especially for 1 cost.  But, Arwen is probably going to win the whole thing.

W - Bifur - Mostly because Haldir ally gets very little play now that Haldir hero is around.

X - Hama - Gimli is solid while underwhelming.  Hama just gives you that sense of security that few others can match.

Y - Gleowine - Because he doesn't look like Steven Segal.

Z - Orophin - He's solid in any Silvan deck.

AA - Treebeard - Sorry Barliman.

AB - Faramir - Potential contender for the title.

AC - Legolas - Best ally attacker?  I do like Denethor though.

AD - Boromir - Gamling has a lot of potential, but I can't vote for someone I don't have yet.

AE - Anborn - I really want the traps to work and he's crucial.

AF - Beorn - One of the non-Gandalf sneak attack combos.

AG - Bill the Pony - No contest

AH - Gandalf - Although I do have a soft spot in my heart for Landroval.

Indeed you are right, I use her with sneak attack only when I need to quest better and do not have Gandalf on my deck, not for her ability , but I should have made the clarification my self, thanks  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Great idea for an (unique) ally championship! I missed round one, but excited to participate in the others. Here it goes:

 

S: Galadriel - her ability just leaves Eomund in the dust.

T: Rùmil - in the right deck, his ability can just be devastating to enemies. As a bonus, he has two willpower in Tactics. As a predominantly Tactics player, this is a no-brainer in my book.

U: Saruman - putting an encounter card out of play for even just a round is one of the most powerful effects in the game.

V: Arwen - the plus one defense and sentinel granted to any character on the board outshines Henamarth by a long shot.

W: Haldir - I don't use Dwarves unless I'm playing The Hobbit saga boxes.

X: Gimli - this dwarf is the exception to the rule mentioned above.

Y: Elrond - sorry, Gleowine, the Lord of Rivendell is just better.

Z: Orophin - recall my dwarf rule.

AA: Treebeard - allies that can pay for things are simply spectacular.

AB: Faramir - this one was close, but willpower boosting is invaluable.

AC: Legolas - card draw in Tactics. Yes!

AD: Boromir - I vote for him because Gamling hasn't been released yet, and therefore I can't properly rate him.

AE: Bofur - Again, two willpower in Tactics makes him worth it. I might need to modify that dwarf rule . . .

AF: Skinbark - there are no words to describe his utility.

AG: Bill the Pony - Bill for the win!

AH: Gandalf - I feel bad for Landroval . . .

S: Galadriel – I foresee Galadriel not having any problems in her bracket until AQ when she faces Arwen.

T: Rumil – Elf vs. “Elf”. The archer wins

U: Saruman

V: Arwen – Henemarth is cool and all, but this is Magali at her finest!

W: Haldir of Lorien

X: Gimli – who ears the beard better? …Gimli

Y: Gleowine – I’ll always vote for a minstrel instead of Steven Seagal

Z: Bofur (spirit) – I have fond memories of using Bofur’s questing trick

AA: Treebeard – I feel bad for Butterbur in this match-up. At least the two of them chare a fondness for hobbits.

AB: Faramir – It’s a shame Faramir was matched against Bregalad, I wanted this Ent of go far

AC: Legolas – Blowing hair in battle always beats nicely combed while sulking

AD: Gamling – Boromir is cool and all, but in this specific match-up, Gamling has the better beard/shield combination.

AE: Bofur (Tactics) – I’d rather fetch weapons than fetch traps

AF: Beorn – Only because I think Beorn hates orces just a smidge more than Skinbark

AG: Bill the Pony – the tenth member of The Fellowship!

AH: Gandalf

S – Eomund – in part because I haven’t used Galadriel much, but also I’ve just rediscovered how much fun Eomund’s leaving play effect is

T – Rumil – maybe not as consistent as Elfhelm, but it’s a great moment when Rumil fires properly, and his stats are very handy

U – Saruman – my new favourite ally. Totally rocked in my current campaign, and his ability to ignore one staging area card can be very potent

V – Arwen – Henamarth is a total dude in solo play, but Arwen is just that bit more versatile for what she does (and her ability activates on exhausting, which is amazing)

W – Haldir – rounded stats, and useful ranged/sentinel. Awesome.

X – Hama – for his sphere, Hama is so effective as a defender. It’s mostly for the sphere, because Gimli is really good too...

Y – Elrond – good stats, and can remove conditions on entering play. So useful.

Z – Bofur – his stats are useful, and his ability is part of so many good combos etc.

AA – Treebeard – a neutral ally for 4 cost who generates resources to ready himself. Oh yes.

AB – Faramir – his ability is incredible, and his stats are good, and he’s in a resource rich sphere. I’m not gonna be surprised if he wins the overall contest.

AC – Legolas – ability is better than Denethor’s, and he’s the same cost

AD – Boromir – great ability and stats, and perhaps more versatile

AE – Bofur – I think he’s got 2 willpower in tactics, and a handy ability. Anborn is a little too expensive, and then his ability seems a waste of his stats (although with Faramir hero in leadership...)

AF – Beorn – for those moments when you gotta smash, there’s few as good as him. plus he's a bear

AG – Bill – free ally that boost hobbit stats! plus Bill’s cost is lower for a useful ally, and Dori often feels too expensive for what he does (especially with the new damage cancellation ally)

AH – Gandalf – close cost comparison, but Gandalf has great stats and obviously a very useful set of effects. Plus he can be abused horribly with sneak attack

I'll give some comentary on the choices this time.

 

S - Galadriel - even though Eomund has a great ability that you can strategize around, Galadriel relies a bit more on luck to find a cool attachment. I'll go with Galadriel though because she has worked great for me and the 3 willpower should not be dismissed.

 

T - Elfhelm - He has good stats and his ability has come in handy many times.

 

U - Saruman - At first I didn't like him so much but he whas worked great in many of my decks so long as you can swallow the 3 threat.

 

V - Arwen - Henamarth is amazing as other have said but Arwen is just so solid in any deck that runs Spirit.

 

W - Haldir - In solo his ability is almost useless, but he has sentimental value for me, and in the Elrold Gandalf deck he is a good all around solid ally you can play for free.

 

X - Hama - Still haven't played either of them, but I want to play Hama more.

 

Y - Elrond - He has proved extremely versatile in many of my decks, whereas Gleowine has only really shined for me in Leadership decks that don't run Lore and need the card draw.

 

Z - Orophin - I just love the silvan elves, and he is one of my favorite silvan allies.

 

AA - Treebeard - He is just so good.

 

AB - Faramir - Kind of an unfair battle as Dan said, as both allies are incredibly powerful overall. Just going with Faramir because Leadership is my favorite sphere.

 

AC - Legolas - No real reason to explain why. Ingold is what ally Denethor should have been. Cheaper and far more reliable in a mono-Leadership deck.

 

AD - Boromir - I wanna say Gamling here since I feel he's going to be really powerful and his art is amazing, but Boromir has proved himself to be great in battle numerous times.

 

AE - Anborn - These 2 allies are great, but I'll go with Anborn as I really want to build a trap deck right now.

 

AF - Beorn - the quintessential tank ally, plus he doesn't enter play exhausted.

 

AG - Bill the Pony - A free 1/1/0 ally that boosts hobbits and can be used as A Very Good Tale fodder? Yes please. Plus, he's really iconic and has great art.

 

AH - Gandalf - Same reason as before, just an incredible ally, especially in a deck that runs Leadership.

## 86 [Eu8L1ch on August 18, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/184799-unique-ally-championship-2015/?do=findComment&comment=1740696)

This time is a lot more difficult to me, since there are many allies I haven't had the chance to play yet (or that I haven't played enough) that are up against real contenders.

 

 

S Galadriel. This is actually pretty easy, as Galadriel is very good for all Leadership-heavy decks (that usually lack card draw), whereas Eomund is a much more situational card.

T Rumil. Haven't played either I lot, but my nod goes to Rumil as he can find space in some Tactics deck focused on direct damage (he enables Pursuing the Enemy too).
U Ingold. Saruman's very situational, and Doomed 3 is huge. Hard to judge considering I've never played Ingold, but the latter looks like a good choice for the typical leadership Gondor deck, so he's potentially more useful.
V Arwen. No brainer, sorry Hena.
W Bifur. High risk of hero clash for both, but Bifur wins the day as he is very good in the right deck, whereas Haldir ally is really overcosted for a unique, considering current standards; his only saving grace are the keywords, but the price is so high that you'll almost never want to play him in a sphere that is full of drawing effects - so less chances of 4 spare resources.
X Gimli. Gimli has a high cost, but action advantage with good stats (possibly improved by Dain). Hama is cheaper and benefits from Rohan synergy, whereas Gimli is not sure to find room in a dwarf deck; however the latter gives better value when he is out. A hard call but I'll choose the Dwarf, this time.
Y Gleowine. Very hard choice; both have their merits, but I'll choose Gleowine since he can provide fantastic value in Solo or in a 2P game, especially when playing with decks that would otherwise lack some card draw.
Z Bofur (spirit). The Dwarf is a life saver, and that's what usually makes the difference between victory and defeat: having help when you're down. Orophin is good only in a Silvan, and even in there is not a fundamental piece: nice to have but not game changing.
AA Treebeard. Another no-brainer.
AB Quickbeam. Ouch, dilemma. Faramir for 3-4 player games, Quickbeam for Solo/2P. Considering cheap allies with awesome stats are always welcome whereas global WP boost is very powerful but you could do without (plus Faramir is very expensive at 4 cost), I'll give my vote to the Ent.
AC Legolas. Legolas is worth every single resource with his stats and ability, whereas Denethor is just average.
AD Gamling. I haven't played much with either, but I like Gamling better for his deckbuilding potential. Not a fan of either card though.
AE Bofur (tactics). Bofur performs an important function within the Tactics sphere, whereas Anborn's usefulness is more limited (and is more expensive).
AF Skinbark. I choose the Ent for flavor mainly, since I like the design of this card a lot. He is very situational, even though a lot of quests feature Orcs. On the other side, Beorn is the typical cheat-me-into-play ally, and I've actually used him in a few decks, so I quite like him. There's not a clear winner for me.
AG Bill the Pony. Free ally and love the character.
AH Gandalf (core). No brainer.

S.  Galadriel.  One shot, but 3 WP, a possible free attachment, and reordering cards.

T.  Elfhelm.  Like the ongoing power over the one-time power.

U.  Saruman.  Even with doomed, extremely powerful effect.

V.  Arwen.  Love the benefit from exhaustion for a quester.

W.  Bifur.  In a dwarf deck.

X.  Gimli.  Can quest and fight regularly.

Y.  Gleowine.  Love the cheap repeatable card draw.  Hard choice.

Z.  Bofur (spirit).  Cheap emergency quester when you need one.

AA.  Treebeard.  Awesome stats, can pay for ents, and can ready ents (including himself)

AB.  Quickbeam.  Faramir's a living STWB, but Quickbeam's so good for so little cost.

AC.  Legolas.  Tactics repeatable card draw who doesn't require keeping heroes healthy

AD.  Gamling.  Boromir's awesome, but Gamling is what Rohirrim need.

AE.  Bofur (tactics).  2 WP in tactics with a useful ability.

AF.  Beorn.  Awesome with sneak attack

AG.  Bill the Pony.  Free ally (with Sam) that makes hobbits less fragile

AH.  Gandalf (core).  Even more awesome than Beorn with sneak attack

S: Eomund - I really like Galadriel, but Eomund is one of the vital pieces that makes Rohan decks so fun

T: Rumil - Even in my Rohan decks, Elfhelm always seems too expensive.

U: Saruman - As much as I love how Ingold works in Gondor decks, Saruman always makes a splash when he hits the table.

V: Henamarth - Arwen is one of those cards that feels really poorly balanced. I have trouble building any kind of blue deck without her. I always find myself building a "Rohan Deck (plus Arwen)" or "Dunedain Deck (plus Arwen)". Auto-include cards are boring, so my vote goes to Henamarth here.

W: Haldir - It's a narrow one, but Haldir is so niche nowadays that I feel good when I get him to work (usually in a Silvan deck).

X: Hama - I always get happy when I see Hama in my hand in my Rohan decks. Love his ability to defend two enemies and survive.

Y: Elrond - I love Gleowine, but Elrond was a sorely needed Condition-canceler-plus-other-stuff-if-there's-no-conditions-in-this-quest card.

Z: Bofur (spirit) - Somehow Orophin always ends up getting cut from my Silvan decks, but Bofur finds his way into all kinds of decks, even non-dwarf ones. Gotta love cheap willpower.

AA: Treebeard - I have never been able to get Barliman to work for me. :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

AB: Faramir - Both cards are a little overpowered. At least Faramir is expensive, making him an interesting choice to try to get to work. There's no reason not to include Quickbeam in a Lore deck, so that makes me grumpy. See V above.

AC: Legolas - Repeatable card draw for Tactics fills a void.

AD: Gamling - Love what he did for the Rohan archetype.

AE: Bofur (tactics) - He always seems to end up in my Tactics decks because he has 2 willpower.

AF: Beorn - It feels so good to sneak attack Beorn in for the kill.

AG: Bill the Pony - I like Sam, I like free allies, I like Bill the Pony.

AH: Gandalf (Core Set) - Mostly because he brings threat reduction to any deck, which gives me a little more freedom when deckbuilding.

S - Galadriel - Eomund can be good these days, but Galadriel brings a lot of value.

T - Rumil - I don't know, but I never get that much use out of Elfhelm.

U - Saruman - I think Ingold is better most of the time, but Saruman has the bigger impact and can win you a game.

V - Arwen - Tough one as Henamarth is so good in solo play, but Arwen may just be my pick for this whole thing.

W - Haldir - Bifur is great for Dwarf decks, but Haldir is more generally useful.

X - Gimli - So good once he hits the table.

Y - Elrond - Gleowine is good, but Elrond provides a solution to a lot of problems at once.

Z - Orophin - Bofur is more versatile, but Orophin is a monster for Silvan decks.

AA - Treebeard - Poor Barliman never had a chance here. He's a sentimental favorite, but Treebeard is just too good.

AB - Faramir - What a matchup! Quickbeam is one of the best allies in the whole game in terms of stats. But I'll give the nod to Faramir for having such a huge impact and potentially winning a game on his own.

AC - Legolas - That card draw is more useful and rare than Denethor's willpower that can only get worse.

AD - Gamling - I do like Boromir, but Gamling is key for his trait.

AE - Bofur (Tactics) - Bofur is a bit cheaper, has rare willpower for his sphere, and is very useful for weapon decks.

AF - Beorn - Skinbark is strong no doubt, but Beorn is a game-changer with Sneak Attack, Elf-stone, etc.

AG - Dori - I love free allies, but Dori is a valuable damage valve.

AH - Gandalf - Landroval can definitely save your bacon, but Gandalf does it more consistently.

Yes, let those Beorn votes roll in! I've got to hit the campaign stump for Beorn. Vote for the candidate that can transform into a freakin' bear, that can tame a troll with a flick of his wrist, that brushes his teeth with spare bits of Nazgul.

 

Vote Beorn 2015!

S - Galadriel, for the versatility. And the artwork on Keen as Lances.

T - Rumil. Direct damage hasn't had much love recently, but Rumil keeps the torch high.

U - Saruman. Who doesn't love the master of Doom?

V - Arwen. She's a team player.

W - Haldir. Still strong, despite the hero version taking the spotlight and the competition from Quickbeam.

X - Gimli. Because he has an axe.

Y - Elrond. He is the Lord of Rivendell, half-elven, father of Arwen, wielder of Vilya, member of the White Council, and all-around wise-guy badass. Gleowine has a harp. No contest.

Z - Bofur. +2 instant willpower on a stick is still a great deal.

AA - Treebeard. He remembers Tasarinan, Ossiriand, Neldoreth, Dorthonion and countless other lands lost beneath the waves. Barliman can't even remember one letter.

AB - Faramir. A team-player and a game-changer rolled into one. Quickbeam might be a hasty ent, but Faramir turned down the One Ring.

AC - Legolas. Because Gimli can't have all the glory.

AD - Gamling. He single-handedly resurrects the Rohan archetype, and Boromir can't even stand up to his ridiculously OP hero version. (Or the other one, even).

AE - Bofur. 2 willpower in tactics? For 3 resources? And a handy ability as icing on the cake? I'll take all of that you got.

AF - Beorn. He's a bear. And a man. It's complicated. Unless you're an orc. In which case it's very simple... and quick.

AG - Bill. It's a tough toss-up between the understated support characters. Dori deserves a shout-out, definitely, for lugging a bargain-barrel burglar through goblin-infested tunnels. But Bill's just a pony. He has to compete with the likes of Firefoot, Arod, and the might Shadowfax. And yet who do people remember? Bill. The Pony. For Pony.

AH - Gandalf. 'Nough said.

Sorry Arwen... I am a big fan of Saruman's hard work in several solo games. Many of my aggro decks have put him to excellent use tucking away Hill Trolls or high threat locations just long enough to secure a win.

 

It feels a little funny to put Bofur (Spirit) ahead of Elrond, but I love the feeling of getting +2 WP for one resource. Despite Elrond's versatility, I still like his hero more. On top of that, three resources has always felt steep for a one-shot effect in lore.

AI - Galadriel - Not super excited about either.  I would have voted for Eomund here if he advanced.

AJ - Arwen - I never play any of the doomed cards, so I'll go with the presumptive champion here.

AK - Haldir - Similar stats, but Haldir has ranged and his art is far better.

AL - Elrond - Gives more utility, despite the bad art.

AM - Faramir - This is the big matchup of the round.  I'm partially voting against Treebeard because Ents are becoming OP.  I'm also voting for Faramir because he has had to beat Gandalf and Quickbeam while Treebeard had the cakewalk of Mablung and Barliman Butterbur.

AN - Legolas - Best ally attacker.  Gamling has potential, but he's not even released yet.

AO - Beorn - Tough call here.  Bofur's willpower is great in tactics, but how can you vote against a guy that can block an attack of 8 and next turn attack for 8?

AP - Bill the Pony - Another tough call, but I feel obliged to vote for the free Hobbit support.

Rumil - you're kidding me? Instant damages! And willpower in tactics! And ranged! And also returnable to your hand via being Silvan!

 

Saruman - I'm astonished Saruman made is this far, but if he did - maybe all is not lost? Vote Saruman! :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

Gimli - Gimli has an action advantage and luxury of not overlapping with the hero in the same sphere. Gimli also has no useless in solo keywords.

 

Bofur - despite Elrond one being extremely useful, Bofur saved my arse one too many times to give his vote to somebody else.

 

Treebeard - because me liksies myself some ents! :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

 

Legolas - not much to comment here.

 

Bofur (Tactics) - any willpower in Tactics is at the weight of gold. And Bofur has it cheaper.

 

Bill the Pony - just because I can :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

We had some pretty interesting results in round 2 by the way. Three matchups came down to a single vote! 

Tactics Bofur, Gamling and Spirit Bofur (both copies of Bofur!) hung in and stayed in the competition thanks to one persons vote. Will any of them advance past the next round however? Also no one received 0 votes this time, even Denethor and Barliman got one vote each! 

Also for all those who complained about Faramir/Quickbeam. Their match up really wasn't even that close..... many other matchups were much closer and I actually expected Quickbeam to get a lot more votes and even have a chance to win, instead Faramir had more than double the amount of votes Quickbeam had. Not even close so I have to say I strongly disagree with everyone who was upset they were facing each other so early on.

Rúmil: i have used him more usually than Galadriel

Arwen: Saruman is funny, but if i see, i have used him only 1 time in my thousand of games

Gimli: Haldir hero can block the Haldir ally, however, Gimli not so often so.

Faramir: Very powerful ally.

Legolas: who is Gamling?^^

Bofur: is more versatile than Beorn

What madness has fallen upon you! Bill the Pony losing to Gandalf! This is an utter travesty and I beg those of you who voted incorrectly to repent and edit you posts immediately.

Galadriel-strictly better than Gandalf's Search.

Arwen-This is a vote for girl power ;-)

Gimli-Is there another ally version that out classes the hero version more?

Elrond-Am I the only one who sees Steven Segal playing a Native American?

Faramir-The answer to my earlier Gimli question.

Gamling-Legolas is a boss, but Gamling is the Rohan ally I have been longing for since Emyn Muil.

Bofur-Sorry, but how did Beorn even make it this far?

BILL THE PONY-The ally of destiny!

AI - Rumil, he is a tactics ally who quests for two and has a nice ability. Galadriel is good also but discarded at the end of the round

AJ - Arwen, her ability has saved me a lot on the past

AK - Gimli, tough one, but Gimli has an ability that makes him of a bit more use especially in solo games that I usually play

AL - Elrond, though discarded I think he ie more usefull

AM - Faramir, ... can't I vote for both?

AN - Legolas, I think he is very strong with a nice ability

AO - Bofur, again a tactics ally that quests for two

AP - Bill the Pony, tha stinky wizard won Gildor, I will never forget that

AI: Galadriel - she's more versatile than Rùmil and can possibly snag an attachment as a bonus.

AJ: Arwen - again with the versatility here; Arwen's more of a team player than Saruman.

AK: Gimli - the exception to the rule I mention below.

AL: Elrond - Spirit Bofur isn't the best way to go anymore. Besides, Elrond can be a game-saver. And - dare I use it again? - my dwarf rule stands.

AM: Treebeard - this is so unfair. I love Faramir, but would rather have his willpower boosting or Treebeard's hero-like stats and the ability to ready an Ent? That aside, this will be a close contest.

AN: Legolas - I go with tried and true. Sorry, Gamling. Maybe next year you'll have my vote . . .

AO: Bofur (Tactics) - it's not that I don't like Beorn's ally; it's that I'd rather use the hero. One of these days, I'll stick to the Dwarf Rule. I think.

AP: Gandalf - it's almost painful to vote this way. Bill is awesome in so many ways: boosting the Hobbits' hit points, coming into play for free with Sam, donating that last point of attack needed to slay an enemy - but Gandalf overwhelms him. Please, dear voters, choose Bill so I don't have to feel so guilty about choosing a wizard!

AI - Galadriel - She is a staple for attachment heavy decks, and without her they don't function nearly as well. Rumil is great but expensive for tactics and decks don't really miss him when they don't draw him.

AJ - Arwen - Enough has already been said on why she's one of the best allies in the game.

AK - Gimli - Similar stats to Haldir but a readying ability? Gimli all the way.

AL - Bofur - Saved my games more times than I can count.

AM - Faramir - A tie in my opinion, but since I consider Treebeard hero better than Faramir hero, that means Faramir ally can get more play.

AN - Legolas - Provides tactics with dependable card craw.

AO - Beorn

AP - Gandalf

AI -   Galadriel. No contest, Rumil is nice but Galadriel is a game changer for Leadership heavy decks, often able to partially repay herself back, rearrage top and providing a nice wp boost.

AJ -  Arwen. No brainer.
AK -  Gimli. Easy call for me. Gimli costs the same resources but in Leadership, has the same stats but action advantage instead of keywords which might be or might not be useful; furthermore no hero clash issues.
AL -  Bofur (S). See motivatios for the previous round; cheap wp when you need it is huge.
AM - Faramir. That's a very difficult decision, with Treebeard probably being better for Solo whereas Faramir is better in 2,3,4 players games. I'll go with the Gondorian Captain for his usefulness and for providing a crucial ability, whereas for the same hefty cost Treebeard provides 'just' stats, albeit awesome.
AN -  Legolas. Looks better than Gamling to me, but I didn't expect either to make it this far tbh.
AO -  Bofur (T). Same as above.
AP -  Gandalf. This is not really a difficult decision. Bill is an auto-include only for Sam decks, and Gandalf will be in almost all of them as well because of Sneak Attack, plus he has a home in countless more decks. Sorry little Pony, it's hurtful for me to vote against you. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
If Gandalf didn't combo with Sneak Attack, maybe..

AI - Galadriel - She's a pretty effective and relatively cheap one instance ally, and in a sphere full of resources she's a good cost

AJ - Saruman - partially just because it's nice to see other allies go up the ranks, but also because I genuinely think that Saruman's ability is amazing, and in a pinch can totally save you

AK - Gimli - same stats, but I feel like Gimli's ability gives him more utility than Haldir's

AL - Elrond - condition removal and stats!

AM - Faramir - the ultimate utility ally, and can even boost ents' willpower.

AN - Legolas - I do like me some Gamling, but Legolas' card draw is just too good

AO - Beorn - shock troops ftw!

AP - Gandalf - joking aside, Gandalf core is a beast, and again, like Saruman, can be a game saver. I love Bill, but he's only occasionally saved a game for me.

 

Becoming an interesting final few rounds. I think the top half is a little less strong than the bottom.

AI- Rumil: Tough call, but I play tactics more than I play leadership, an in the right ranged or Silvan deck, Rumil is awesome.

AJ- Saruman: Arwen is the better ally, is in way more decks, and has received more play.  She's going to win this match up and probably should, but there is no card in the game like Saruman, who can literally end a game when he comes into play (for good hopefully because you removed that last location or enemy, but he can end it for evil too by threating you out).  He gets the vote here.

AK-Gimli: Love Haldir and I used to use him a lot, but Lore is finally getting some decent allies and the new Gimli is awesome in whatever deck you put him in.

AL-Bofur: Still use this guy to great effect in a lot of my spirit decks.

AM-Treebeard: Most difficult decision of the round.  Going with Treebeard because I wanted to see Quickbeam win last round.

AN-Legolas: Haven't used Gamling yet.  He looks great, but I'll give the nod to Legolas.

AO-Beorn: Sneak attack bear bomb dropped in by eagles.

AP-Bill: He makes it into more of my decks these days than the wizard.  You can't beat a free ally, and Sam is one of my favorite heroes in the game.

AI - Galadriel, because Rumil, being the class-act that he is, respectfully bows out in deference to the Lady of the Golden Wood.

AJ - Saruman. He sold out Eowyn to Grima. This Istari has no respect whatsoever for the women of Middle-earth, and he shows none for Arwen in a series of scathing ad hominem attacks projected in wizard voice from the pinnacle of Orthanc. Honey-on-the-tongue but venom in voice, Saruman's spite drives Arwen into the West.

AK - Gimli. Dwarf v. Elf in an arm-wrestling match sparked by a minor disagreement over a blindfold. Gimli the always-ready, however, pulls a surprise upset. "My axe is restless!" he screams as he slams the marchwarden's hand onto the table.

AL - Bofur. Elrond may be the Master of the House, but Bofur is master of the tag-team. Wisely abandoning the match with Beorn (seriously, who's honestly going to go head-to-head with the guy who single-handedly made it the Battle of FIVE Armies, not four?), tactics Bofur melds with his spirit form into MegaBofur, Master of Hammer-space! (Seriously, where do you think he finds those weapon attachments and where he pops out from on a moment's notice?). Muttering about all this *&%^ anime nonsense, Elrond declares he has better things to do and heads off to do some research (in the discard pile).

AM - Treebeard. The lead ranger may be one of the noblest of the faithful line of Stewards, but Treebeard is a hero masked as an ally. He is neutral only because he perfectly blends the four spheres and the four basic functionalities -- he has strong leadership (rallying the reclusive ents to march to war), he has strong tactics (tearing apart Isengard with his bare hands), he has strong spirit (rising to the occassion despite three ages of accumulated griefs and the fading of his people), and strong lore (his memory is literally the oldest, with the possible exception of Tom Bombadil).

AN - Legolas. Somebody has to keep count with Gimli, and after Haldir's embarassing route in the arm-wrestling fiasco, Legolas steps up to the plate. With an apologetic nod to the aged Gamling, the elf gracefully pirouettes over his white mane and takes the match. 

AO - Beorn. No contest, see AL.

AP - Gandalf. The quarter-finals are no fit place for a pony, and Sam reluctantly sends Bill back home. But it's ok, for despite being abandoned in the wilderness of the bracket, all ends well for Bill back in the Shire: "Bill the pony was with them, and as before he had a good deal of baggage, but he trotted along beside Sam and seemed well content."- Return of the King

AI - Galadriel - I don't usually include either of these allies in my decks, but Galadriel has far more uses than Rumil, who is restricted to 1 deck type (Silvans).

AJ - Arwen - Cheaper, doesn't raise your threat, and all-around solid.

AK - Gimli - The only thing Haldir has that Gimli doesn't is the Ranged keyword.

AL - Bofur - I tend to steer away of one-time use ally cards. Bofur's ability is great, especially with Dain.

AM - Treebeard - This is my pick for the winner. Hopefully it doesn't come down to him and Bill...

AN - Legolas - Tactics card draw and 3 ranged attack power? What's not to love? (Well, I guess the 4 cost, but...)

Round 3 has closed! The image on page 1 should update shortly with the results.

Example of a Round 4 vote:

AQ Arwen

AR Gimli

AS Treebeard

AT Gandalf

 

Notes for Round 3:

Faramir V Treebeard was insanely close at 18 to 16 votes and Treebeard narrowly achieved victory!

Pretty much every other round was fairly one sided.

Gandalf and Arwen in the finals is no surprise. Galadriel and Elrond, both 3 cost allies that only last a round have made it this far. Perhaps these powerful one shot allies are better than some think!

I think Treebeard may win the whole thing to be honest, my money and vote (if I was voting, I have not been voting to keep things fair as the organiser) go to him!

AQ - Arwen - I've never successfully gotten an attachment with Galadriel, so one turn of willpower and reordering cards isn't worth it to me.

AR - Elrond - I feel like neither of these allies belong in the final 8.  I'll take the versatility of Elrond over the mediocrity of Gimli.

AS - Legolas - Really tough call here and I'm ignoring the fact that the Legolas hero is 10x better than the Treebeard hero.  Treebeard is great and all, but he does take a while to get running.  Legolas meanwhile is the only 3+ attack ranged ally (besides Vassal) and is pretty much a guaranteed +1 card draw every turn.  I think these should both advance and we can kick out Gimli/Elrond.

AT - Gandalf - As much as I love Beorn, he rarely makes it into any of my decks.  Meanwhile Gandalf is probably in half my decks.

This round will be easy, for me: two of the strongest contenders are gone, so we're left with just the elite and some average/slightly more than average allies.

 

AQ Arwen - No need to elaborate on this one I think.

AR Elrond - I agree with Teamjimby: neither of these deserves top 8, I'll go with flexibility.

AS Treebeard - Legolas is a nice ally, but there's no contest for me: 4 cost in tactics vs 4 cost neutral; much less chances of hero clash; Treebeard provides a solid combat boost to every deck and provides action advantage too. Both are mainly solo-2P allies, so the Ranged doesn't really make that much of a difference. Card draw is nice, but Legolas is the last thing you'll play in a Tactics deck, so that's going to help you only if the game is going to last for a good while.

AT Gandalf - Gandalf is much stronger with sneak Attack: 4 attack + 4 direct damage means he's actually better than our dear Skinchanger, and he has an awesome flexibility Beorn lacks, and I could go on listing Gandalf's advantages; it's clear for me gameplay-wise there's no contest.

AQ: Arwen. The hero version will have to be ridiculously powerful if she is ever going to see play over the ally.

AR: Gimli. I'll pay four resources for an ally who will act twice a round for the rest of the game over three resources for an ally who has a quest dependent ability then is gone after one turn (though I do like sneak attacking Elrond).

AS: Treebeard. Ents, plus adds pure power to any deck he's in. Tactics card draw is awesome, but I'll take Treebeard for the sheer number of decks you can throw him into. I'm also rooting for him to win the whole thing.

AT: Beorn. I consider core Gandalf to be a deck building crutch I try to avoid using, while Beorn is a blast to cheat into play and lay the smack down.

AQ - Arwen - 'Nuff said.

AR - Elrond - Gimli is super good, but I find Elrond to be a good solution to a lot of problems.

AS - Treebeard - 4 resources from any sphere is far easier to muster than 4 from Tactics. He also has huge stats and readying. 

AT - Beorn - I will carry the banner forward for Beorn. When paired with Merry, he is a monster and is a boss-killer. Beats out Gandalf when an enemy is "immune to player card effects" (often the case for bosses) since big G's direct damage can't be used. Granted, Gandalf is probably the better ally overall, but when Beorn hits the table, all feels right with the world.

Tough choice, but I'm gonna stick with the guy who sticks around again. He has great stats and built-in readying too. Hard to beat that.
AS- Treebeard
Like Gimli, he's got great stats (only better!) and built-in readying, though it won't happen as often as Gimli. Also, being neutral helps him fit into any deck.

AT- Gandalf

Beorn is expensive and can only be bought with Tactics resources which are usually hard to come by. Gandalf has a powerful ability that is also very flexible and it doesn't feel nearly as lame to pop him in with Sneak Attack for only a phase.

People argue about what he will do when he gets into office, about his versatility, but they don't consider that he won't even stick around for his entire term.

What this man is trying to say becomes clear if you substitute the word Gandalf with Beorn.

A Skin-Changer and what kind of change! A grumpy old man, who doesn't really like anybody only trusts maybe the Wizard, Gandalf, who has the trust of every respectable person in ME, changes into a huge Bear sometimes. He is under a spell! What could be worse then a grumpy old bear who wants to kill. And he wants to kill, but only stick around for 1 week into his time in office to then suddenly change and start destroying everything in the office. What is he thinking?!

 

Vote for Gandalf. The Grey Pilgrim, the White Rider! He has depths of wisdom and knowledge hidden underneath his brows. He will always aid the good cause and sacrifices himself for his friends and the sake of all of Middle-Earth. What could be more sacrificial then giving up your own live? He might not be the most reliable source of power, but power he has and he will be there when the beacons are lit, when everything seems to fall apart, when the world seems to be closing in.. Gandalf will be there!

AQ - Arwen. Sticking around helps a lot, and two dependable willpower plus a defense boost to a hero? That's great. Meanwhile, with Galadriel you'd most likely be playing Leadership, and have resources available for those expensive attachments. And even though her three willpower can be great, she leaves play at the end of the round. Additionally, I use Galadriel in hero form very often.

AR - Elrond. My dwarf rule finally prevailed over Gimli son of Gloin! Admittedly, Gimli's readying is a great asset, but Elrond has saved me more than once. Three willpower is great, even for just one round (I know I just made the opposite argument with Galadriel. Bear with me), and he has defended a few times, too. Plus, his three hit points is an archery soak not to be overlooked. But the main thing that wins my vote for Elrond is his ability. He has healed an innumerable amount of damage from my heroes, and removed condition attachments many a time.

AS - Treebeard. The Ent wins this one. I know that the Elves taught Ents to speak, but, personally, I like the Legolas hero better than the ally, as amazing as he is in a Silvan deck. Treebeard's ally stats are one more than his hero stats! I love the hero, but the ally is so useful in readying Ents, and he can easily attack or defend.  

At - Gandalf. Any questions? Sorry, Beorn, but I rarely use you, and although I tend to include Gandalf less than I used to, he is a game-changer whenever he arrives. Not to say Beorn isn't either, but Gandalf's effects, especially dealing four damage to an enemy, have only increased in power over the years. Except card draw. I find I rarely use that one.

AU: Arwen - I give my heart to the evening. Go fetch your axe, Gimli, and see what you can do about it. My Dwarf Rule finally held out! Quite honestly, it was a harder choice than I expected. I go with Arwen though because her ability to grant +1 defense and sentinel is a smidge better than Gimli's readying in my opinion.

AV: Treebeard - Gandalf always has some "urgent" business elsewhere; maybe that's why he rushes off at the end of the round. Again, a tough call, but Treebeard's utility even outside an Ent deck makes him worth it.

Gimli is nice but Arwen is amazing. Meanwhile Gandalf at this point is often not that great without Sneak Attack. Better to invest in a permanent improvement to your board state rather than a single round boost which will leave you with much the same problems once he leaves again. Treebeard on the other hand offers tremendous value for resources, with his amazing statline and his ability to really ramp up the rest of your Ent deck, or save resources for a power turn with lots of Ent-readying.

I think Gimli is a fine ally and he may prove more powerful than Arwen in the long run. They both provide willpower and sentinel defense in one way or another. Arwen is a bit cheaper and always provides her defense, whereas Gimli can't do both unless a new enemy shows up. It's a difficult decision, but for now I give Arwen the advantage.

 

Treebeard sticks around and either readies himself or plays nicely with other ents. Gandalf does make a splash, but his cost is high if you aren't bringing him out with Sneak Attack-type effects. Treebeard sticks around and pays for himself while providing round after round of stats better than most heroes.

AU - Arwen - I keep trying to put Gimli in my decks, but unless I'm going mono-Leadership 4-cost is really hard for me to swallow. I guess he doesn't really fit my style.

AV - Gandalf - I love Treebeard. He's an excellently designed card, and he's so versatile. But since the beginning of this game I have always appreciated how spot-on the mechanics and theme of core Gandalf is. He always seems to swoop in at the last minute and save the day.

AU: Arwen. No match. 4 resources is a steep price to pay, while Arwen, for just 2 cost, is the paradigm of efficiency.

 

AV: Treebeard. This was harder because Sneaky Gandalf is much more powerful than Treebeard. In addition to this Gandalf provides flexibility to every deck. However, for the pirce of 5 resources I'd rather have Treebeard who has amazing stats and in-built readying. So, considering that I don't like the SA+Gandalf combo very much (it feels an exploit for me) and the fact that I love Ents, my vote goes to Treebeard.

Semi Finals Voting has Closed!

 

Gandalf was defeated by Treebeard by a mere two points!!! No version of Gandalf in the finals! Very unexpected!!!

Arwen won by an absolute landslide against Gimli with 34 votes to 4!

 

Arwen V Treebeard Finale!

Get your vote in!

There is also a Bronze Medal match between Gimli and Gandalf which I think we all know who will win but needs voting on as well. Your Final vote should look something like this:

AW: Arwen. Tough choice. While Treebeard is great Solo and can be played in every deck, Arwen is very very good both in MP and Solo. In addition to this, Spirit is almost a must have in most games, so Arwen is almost guaranteed to see play. It really aches me having to vote against Treebeard, but Arwen's so beautiful that I think I'll be able to endure it. :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

AW - Treebeard

3P - Gandalf

 

Treebeard can contribute to any part of the round admirably, sticks around, is Neutral, enables a powerful archetype but merits inclusion even without the other Ents. I have to give him the nod, here. Arwen is strong, of course, and she is a finalist over many other strong allies. I just don't think she carries as many games as Treebeard does, based on my own experience.

 

Gandalf is the epitome of versatility. Competing against a Leadership ally, he is still the better Sneak Attack target. I still think Gimli is quite powerful for being able to quest and contribute to either side of combat against a new enemy, but Gandalf can do similar (usually to greater effect) for any sphere.

So. Very. Tough. (Though I was glad to see Gimli crushed by Arwen. That's what you get for giving your love to the morning, Dwarf!)

AW: Treebeard - the stats alone decided it for me. However, the textbox on Treebeard just seals the deal. He collects resources, can pay for Ents, AND ready any Ent character for two resources? Yes, please. Glad to see Arwen make it to the finals, however.

3P: Dare I say it? Does the Dwarf break my rule at last? What does the son of Gloin have over an Istari, anyway? I'm not going to soliloquize: Gimli has solid stats and can potentially ready after questing. Meanwhile, Gandalf can create a big impact when he enters play and then vanishes at the end of the round. The Wizard is not necessary for winning a tough scenario anymore. So my vote goes to . . . Gimli!

AW Treebeard. Neutral with those stat lines that sticks around, and with in-built readying for allies (including himself)?! So OP, and a win every time. (While Arwen is awesome, spirit just has so many other advantages going for it that I like to see a versatile power card that can be used in non-spirit decks).

 

3P Gandalf. Much as I love Gimli (and would have liked to see him and Legolas make it into the bronze match together!), he's just not as versatile and essential as the classic Grey Wanderer. Whatever you need -- willpower, damage, cards, threat reduction, defense -- Mithrandir has your back. Plus, you can call him almost anything you want: Tharkûn, Stormcrow, Greyhame, The White Rider, Incánus, or the name first given to him in Valinor, Olórin. Fitting for an ally who can fit into any deck and fill almost any role.

She beat Treebeard 21 to 12. 

Gandalf took third place with a whopping 27 votes to 6. 

As many anticipated Arwen took the title of best unique ally without any real effort. She crushed every single competitor (even Saruman!) and as appropriate faced the toughest competitor in the final and Treebeard may not have won but got the most votes of anyone who had to face Arwen. 

I had great fun hosting this and hope you all enjoyed getting involved. May do another in the future once we get a whole heap more unique allies, will need to be a fair few though or it'll be too similar to this years one.
