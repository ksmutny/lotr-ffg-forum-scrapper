There are some cards with this text:

...what happens: each new round, do they change of controller? do they pass to first player's control?

Yes. My memory is fuzzy (I'm only on my first cup of coffee), but I seem to recall us coming across this question playing Fords not too long ago. For one reason or another we deemed that Grima, at least, would bounce around with the first player button.

 

Not a helpful post, but I'll try and remember why.

There is also the Ranger of Ithilien from the Massing at Osgiliath who goes under the control of the first player.  Any time a card says it goes under control of the first player (lets say Bob) it will do that and always be under that player's (Bob) control. I don't think it switches or gets passed around unless the rules specifically say like it does for Frodo and Bilbo in the Saga boxes.

Woah, I have totally overlooked this and with all objective allies that join the first player, I've been swapping their control back and forth each round..... is it definitely the case that they stick to the one person and only bilbo/frodo change control each turn? Would really love to know now!

Arwen objective is meant to follow the first player.

The thing is : "the first player gains control of XXX" is a passive... mostly.

In case of Ranger of Ithilien, it is a when revealed effect, so yes, he sticks to whoever was the first player at this time.

If the objective's text has the wordings of "gains control of", it will pass along the first player marker.  For Grimbeorn the old, since it does not mention "control", it stays with one player.  I think it is clarified by Nate long time ago.

Ah, true. One thing is "gains control of 'objective'" and other very diferent "'objective' joins to". A little confused but ok.

grima should bounce around - b/c you can't pass the quest card unless the first player controls grima (or something like that) which would mean you'd have to wait a few turns for the player controlling grima to be first again (potentially).

 

if it says the first player controls, the objective ally bounces around.
