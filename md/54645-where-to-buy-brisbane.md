Hi all,

I'm really keen to get this game - a solo fantasy collectable card game!? I'm there!

Does anyone know where I can purchase this in Brisbane, Queensland?

Thanks,

Jay

Just wanted to let everyone else know that Battle Station in Ipswich and Good Games in Brisbane can order the core set in if you want them. No luck with Ace or or Comics Etc unfortunately.

I know that Ace at Annerley sells it, they just don't have stock. last time I was there (a couple of weeks ago) they had the expansions inside the glass display beneath the counter :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Thanks for the tip. I'm still hoping either Ace or Comics Etc in the city start carrying it too.

Hi Jay,

 

Having purchsed various elements of this game through various suppliers both locally and internationally (I am a South Australian), I have the following to suggest:

Military Simulations - a victoria based warehouse company - cheap postage and great prices, but you may have to wait a month post American release of expansions. www.milsims.com.au [http://www.milsims.com.au]

Of course there is always Amazon - very hit and miss, I have had them beat friends who purchase from milsims and I have also had them deliver cards a week after my friends have received them from the local supplier.

More recently I have been buying my cards direct from FFG via their online store on this website. Much like Amazon, postage has been hit and miss thus far.

Long story short - I think postage and availability will fluctuate, so I don't think you can lose with either direct from FFG or locally (Mil sims). I wouldn't bother with Amazon, the prices aren't that much of a saving and they tend to mail out a bit later than the local guys and of course they are always mailing out later than FFG direct.

Whilst I have had a peek at local retailers here in SA - I find local retail shops are always charging a good $10 above what I can get things from via postage.

Hope that helps!
