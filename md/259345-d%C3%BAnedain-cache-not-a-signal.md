# [Dúnedain Cache, not a signal?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/259345-d%C3%BAnedain-cache-not-a-signal/)

I guess this question has been put on the table many times, but oh well...

I don't understand why Dúnedain Cache is an item, and not a signal. There can't be any broken combo as of yet (haradrim cycle), Rune-master exhausts and there are no other signal cards that interact with it in a strange way.

I'm sure I realized about it years ago, but building a Dúnedain deck today I stumbled with that again. Just a minor thing, I'm sure, but is strange nonetheless.

Cuz it is a hidden set of equipment (items) and not a warning scrawled on a rock (signal). It was not done for game mechanics, so looking for game mechanic explanation, like broken combos, is a dead end.  It's just card theme pure and simple.  It is inconvenient now that we have cards that interact with the signal trait, but at the time it was released, we had none. So there's your explanation.

And a good one on that regard, Grandspleen. I guess it makes sense. Thank you.

The thing is that a lot of those signals have some "spoils" drawn but aren't item traited, like dúnedain remedy or warning (maybe even quest?), but is better (for me) to be less picky :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png].

This card should have been renamed in "Dunedain Equiment" or "Dunedain Bow", so it makes sense that it is an item and perhaps a weapon :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
It physically makes no sense that a cache is an item.

Thanks for the explaination. I know that :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

In german it's called "Versteck der Dunedain", which is the location where the items are hidden. And this is not the right translation for an item.

Gotcha.  That makes perfect sense.  I speak several languages and can read a few others.  I'd never really considered how a good translator takes liberties with names, but probably has no flexibility with keywords.  I'm sure that causes more than a few disconnects in games.  If it's an 'item' in English, it'll be an 'item' in German also...  but a 'cache' becomes a 'versteck' to more closely match the art...  which is of a hiding place and not the actual items in the hiding place.

Yes, it's more a location than an item. So for me the german version has to be renamed as said into "Ausrüstung der Dunedain". In the end, it's a very untypical card .. it "moves" like the signals but is not one, it grands you ranged but is no weapon. If it was a weapon, than it is the only weapon which can be "moved" between heroes and would interact with cards like "Foe-Hammer". 
I think the developers try to get a signalstyle-card like Dunedain Signal which provides Ranged instead of Sentinel. 
If i could redesign this card i would remove the Signal-move-ability and make this card a weapon like the Ranger Bow, which you have to exhaust in order to get Ranged for the end of the phase. Costs 1 and is not restricted.

If I could redesign the card I'd just make it a signal.
