Picked up the new pack at GC Friday, thumbed through the cards, and celebrated the arrival of Haldir - the answer to a long-time challenge my wife and I have had in our hero distribution choices. It's complicated to explain so I will save that for the thread in the strategy section where my decks are posted.

 

I didn't realize the full power of the card, but my wife did. We had to read the card six or seven times to make sure we weren't missing anything.

 

As long as you don't engage an enemy, you can attack any enemy you are not engaged with. Any enemy. To me, upon initial reading, I made the presumption that I would pull enemies and block with Denethor and then Haldir could attack with Legolas to my side of the table, or perhaps Haldir would kill them before Denethor needed to block.

 

My wife targeted enemies in the staging area. I can't see any indication that she was wrong in doing so. Did we miss something?

Haldir can only attack alone with his ability. No Legolas piggy-back.

Nop you do not miss something, if you don't engage any enemies you have the 2nd hero of the game that can target enemies in the staging area "naked"

Correct. Only Haldir. With a Dagger of westernesse and sylvan blade, he's swinging for a total of 7 on his own, effectively.

 

The reference to Legolas attacking alongside is because they both have ranged.

Yeah I've been using him too. Insanely powerful (especially against quests that feature smaller to medium sized enemies and not just boss sized ones like trolls, guardians etc) in that not only can he eliminate enemies in staging but also enemies engaged with other players/decks and often when doing so he provides a feint effect stopping that enemy attacking that round resulting in less overall attacks needing to be defended. Just crazy good. I also use Legolas as well and man slapping a rivendell blade, dagger of westernesse and dunedain mark on each makes for two very skilled and versatile warriors!

You engaging an enemy and an enemy engaging you have been considered the same thing in this game so does that mean if an enemy engages you you then can't use his ability? You then have to keep your threat low to make him work or have other players engage all the enemies.

Or use some ranger tricks to keep them away.

He definitely seems to fit with the Ithilien Rangers and traps deck.

He's the ranger, after all.
