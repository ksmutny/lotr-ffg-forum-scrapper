# [Hunt for Gollum preview](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/48022-hunt-for-gollum-preview/)

## 1 [Ismar on June 7, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/48022-hunt-for-gollum-preview/?do=findComment&comment=481718)

I'm running the Preview event for my LGS, so I got a chance last night to run through the Hunt for Gollum.

Very interesting scenario, it makes you feel like you really are hunting for clues on Gollum's whereabouts.

We've all seen Bilbo, so no surpirses there.  The other player cards are interesting as well, some more effective than others.  We get out first attachment that can be moved to other characters, and some nice allies.

There are some nasty encounter cards as well

Sorry, I can't give any real details, but I just wanted to let people know they won't be disappointed with the adventure pack (at least I wasn't).  I would definitely try and make an event this weekend.

If you're looking for one, and in the Pittsburgh area, stop by Legions Hobbies and Games on Sunday.

Thanks,

Don

Can you give the difficulty level of the scenario?

Our store still hasn't gotten their copy in yet. I was never worried about being disappointed though ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]
How is your store planning on running the event?

I'm sure after the event posting spoilers will be ok, though I'd label it since maybe some people don't want to know until they can buy their own.

I think that would be OK.

It's difficulty 4.

Also, the quest does use 2 encounter decks from the core set, along with the one that comes with it (gollum).

At one point during questing, there were only 2 enemies and 1 location in the staging area, and the threat level was 22 that turn!  There are some nasty surprises and combos awaiting you.

Thanks a lot for the informations.

I have 2 core sets, so unless someone brings a third, we'll only get 2 games in at a time.

I'm thinking of running it as a pseudo-tournament for the first play through, 2 teams, 1 per core set. The team with the best score will win 1 copy of the adventure pack - they can figure out how to divy it out. After that we'll probably play through more casual. At the end we may raffle off another pack

During the first play through, I won't let the players see the next part of the quest until they finish each stage, to keep the surprise factor high. Should be fun and tense.

I think after Friday posting spoilers would be OK. You'll probably see a lot of info then.

Thanks,

What interests me most: are all encounter cards part of one Hunt for Gollum set, or are there subsets (meaning some of those cards might pop up in later scenarios)?

Not sure what you mean.  All the encounter cards have the same "gollum" symbol.  I would assume these cards would be used in subsequent sets in the series, and maybe even beyond.

Does that answer your question?

We just got it in today! <3

I didn't realize at first you'd need encounter cards from the core set, but that makes sense. We should have 3 sets available without much problem, if 3 need to be run at once :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] I plan on sleeving the cards just so they stay in good shape.
It does say in the insert that you will need two other specific sets of encounter cards from the core set mixed in with the Gollum cards to run it.

I'm not really a fan of the current scoring system, so we probably won't use it though people are welcome to score if they want (unless the majority decide they'd prefer to use it.) I suggested people bring their own decks to play since that's generally more fun, though it may have to involve some compromise if people want to play similar decks or heroes (I think its rather hard to have more than 3 people play what they want with custom built decks- the 4th is always stuck with what heroes are left.) We'll also have the basic core decks available for people who don't yet own the game or don't have a deck to play.

I know FFG has said it before, but I can confirm there's 3 of each of the player deck cards (other than Bilbo, of which there is 1.) The scenario cards vary.

I didn't even look at the scenario cards other than the pictures yet, I want it to be a surprise when we get a chance to try it out and learn it. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Can you tell us about the card distribution?

I'm assuming that the hero is 1x (why would there be more) what's the split of the remaining cards between quest/encounter and player deck? are the player deck cards 3x, or an erratic mixture like the core set?

If you can't give out that info, I understand, but it'd be nice if you could post it after Friday (or whenever the preview events are) as the are NO previews anywhere in the UK, so we'll be waiting another month or more for this one.

MightyJim,

I think we already know that there is 1 hero card, which we get one of, and 9 player cards, and we get three of each of them.  Need to wait for info from the preview on quest and encounter deck.

Which 2 encounter themes from the base set are added to the new Hunt for Gollum set?

I wasn't sure if it should be specified yet, since its part of the pack insert and could be spoilers?

I don't think it'd spoil much. Anyhow, I'm guessing the Wilderness and Orcs. Although Orcs have been everywhere so far, so perhaps Anduin? I hope we get to see the Mirkwood encounter cards yet.

Yeah they all have the same symbol, so they as a whole could show up again in a later encounter but I'm not sure. The whole "signs of gollum" theme seems pretty specific to this part of story but I would think future ones would at least use encounter sets from the core set. I'm speculating they may need to evetually do a bigger more generic box to draw on a different range of base encounter cards in the future.

Well I think it would spoil a bit of the reveal at Pre-Releases. Plus once it is revealed players will know a bit of what is coming down the pipeline. Wouldn't be as much fun if people already had decks geared up for it.

I agree, in this special case, the encounter decks' identities should be witheld until after the event. Although, there won't be much suspense once people buy the regular packs, since they would have to make up the encounter deck in advance, therefore knowing what goes in there.

## 19 [BoundForGlory on June 9, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/48022-hunt-for-gollum-preview/?do=findComment&comment=482956)

 I like to sleeve each scenario separately.  If I get enough copies of the core set, I can pre-mix the encounter decks, them sleeved in different colors, and be ready to go with less set-up time.

I'm wondering if I'm going to have to get a new base set for my Hunt for Gollum encounter deck, or if I can use the unused parts from the other adventures.  If you don't want to spoil it on the boards, that is fine.  If you could PM me, that would be great.

We are not bringing our own pre-built decks to the HfG event anyway, so it won't make a difference as far as that goes.  We are using the decks that the store pre-builds for us.  They are using it as a demo of the game.  Not any kind of tournament.
