 Can you use Thror's Map to make Rhosgobel the active location even if you're on stage 1 of A Journey to Rhosgobel?

Thanks for your help!

Yes, you can.

Players cannot travel to Rhosgobel while Stage 1b is the active quest card. That just prevents you from taking the normal travel action during the travel phase. When you swap locations with Thror's Map, though, you aren't traveling anywhere, so it's perfectly legal.

 Agreed…

 

And don't forget about Northern Tracker along with Asfaloth

 That's what I thought, since it says "make" it the active location, not "travel". 

Thanks
