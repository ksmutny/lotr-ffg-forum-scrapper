Is there any special timing for the elimination of a player by having too much Threat?

 

When does this happen precisely?  Page 22 of the rulebook says this: "A player is eliminated from the game if all of his heroes are killed, if his threat level reaches 50, or if a card effect forces his elimination."

 

Does that happen immediately?  At the end of the current phase?  End of the current round?

 

Right now, I assume immediately, but this is not 100% clear.

Immediately, soon as the threshold is reached it is game over.
