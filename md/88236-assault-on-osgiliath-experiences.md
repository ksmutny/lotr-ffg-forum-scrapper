# [Assault on Osgiliath Experiences](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88236-assault-on-osgiliath-experiences/)

## 1 [Pharmboys2013 on August 11, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88236-assault-on-osgiliath-experiences/?do=findComment&comment=836529)

After what seemed like a fort night of eager anticipation, I received my "assault on osgiliath" adventure pack today in the mail and played the scenario several times both solo and with a local friend.

 

In general speaking about the quest it seems like a relatively fair scenario.  By that i mean, there arent any cards that are going to end the game the second they show up (like a sleeping sentry or the much discussed watcher in the wood).  There are however many powerful and brutal cards.  The Southran Commander is practically a stronger Haradrim Elite and the Uruk Lieutenant can be especially painfully especially if he pulls out a bulky enemy like the orc vanguard.  The treacheries are actually quite mild except for Pinned Down which can be just a killer if there are any other archery enemies in play. The quest does seem to increase in difficulty with the number of players as there is a much greater likelihood revealing more osgliliath locations during staging if you are with 2 or 3 people thus prolonging the game. 

 

This quest is uncommon in that the longer the game goes the tougher it becomes where as most scenarios if you can make it thru the first few turns and set up; you'll generally be just fine.  With assault on osgiliath, you need to be lucky enough to win within the first 2-3 turns or you're going to be in for a long battle.

 

For my 5 solo attempts i used a different deck each time.  Mono-lore, Lore/Tactics, Lore/Spirit, Mono-leadership/outlands and Mono-tactics. (each lore variation used Faramir and the various ranger cards).  My first attempt with mono-lore lasted forever as i kept staging into osgiliath locations, there was a few times i thought i was just about finished, but eventually won.  I conveniently pulled out all 3 ranger spikes quite early which was a nice boost for faramir.  Lore/tactics and outlands lost quickly as i couldnt get enough will power fast enough and quickly became bogged down with enemies and locations before i could get things set up.  On my Lore/spirit and Mono-tactics i was able to achieve quick victories as i lucked out by only revealing 1 additional osgiliath location after the initial set up.

 

I played 3 2-player matches with my friend who was using a glorfindel-elrohir-elladan deck.  I used the outlands, mono-tactics, and spirit/lore.  The outlands attempt went relatively smoothly and we recorded a respectable score.  The Spirit/lore attempt took forever as it seemed the locations would never stop flowing.  On top of that there was an almost endless amount of archery damage being dealt.  At one point we had 3 southran mercenaries and an orc arblaster in the staging area.  Combine those with the pinned down treachery and we had all our characters 1 hp away from death.  Eventually won but it took forever. I used mono-tactics for our final 2 player attempt.  It did not end well.  on like turn 2 we staged into an uruk lieutenant who pulled out the orc vanguard and southran support which pretty much overwhelmed and killed us

 

that was way too much typing but id love to hear you're experiences too as it seems like this is a quest that will mostly turn out differently for each player

Hoping the UK release is fairly swift. I want to get the knights for a solo-tactics deck. Also a Faramir/Dunhere deck is calling.

I already mentioned this in another thread, but this scenario is bets be played with 2 (or moreß) players. Whe you play it solo it can be over after 2-3 turns, so I'd suggest to change the rules so that you have to explore at least X Osgiliath locations, with X being a number of your liking.

 

I also played it two-handed, and that is a lotm of fun. As Pharmboys said, this quest keeps the tension high and doesn't get boring after a few turns. And it can take forever, most of these games took around 13-15 turns. Almost all my losses were due to reaching the threat limit, so threat managment is vital. It's an excellent designed quest for multiplayer, but not as well thought out for solo mode.

After my first two games (second turn wins by choosing The King's Library) I randomly selected the opening location leaving the library out. Drew Ancient Harbor. Turn one win with Boromir. Guess I'll have to flip a coin between West Gate and The Old Bridge.

I can see this adventure could be really hard with multiple players btw.

Another game: flipped a coin and put The Olde Bridge in the staging area and it stayed there until the end of the game. This game went much longer, but it was really never in doubt. Once Boromir gets loaded up with a Gondorian Shield and a Burning Brand he is a freaking wall. And you don't need much questing power on this quest either if you are able to kill off the enemies each turn.

Yes.  And as soon as I can get her out I have Arwen adding another point of defense.

Sounds like for solo game no epic battle. just only for 2 or more players. when you play solo you win quickly or you lose.

Hmmmmm not really good idea.....But always can make it more difficult: for solo win if you control 2 locations or even 3?

I'm thinking along those lines: must control all unique Gondor locations (4). I had 2 uniques and 3 normals at the end of my last game.

You couls also add Old Harbor and Old Bridge at the start of the game. For one you have to exhaust a hero to make one point progress, for the other you have to pay 1 or 2 resources to make one point progress. That should keep you busy for 5-6 turns, and in that time you should have drawn the one or the other additional Osgiliath location and soome nasty enemies. I still prefer to play it two handed.

> burning brand on boromir? with a song right?

Song gives only a resource icon, it does not makes character a "Lore" character, so I would assume you can't put Burning Brand on Boromir at all.

Bullroarer Took

Are you still using Boromir tactics, Glorfindel spirit, Aragorn lore deck that we came up with during HoN Scenarios. I have not touched it since then. If so, i 'd like to see how the deck has evolved since then. Maybe update the original thread if your still using those

Also,

Having the resource icon is what makes a lore character so, songs and burning brand will work. Narvi's belt will also work.

No yoi can. But i like the way how you think and i agree this is more logic.

Boromir is crazy powerful ability break quest mechanic. Same in FFM with tools attach.

often you dont need it. follow it through...

 

song of wisdom is known to make a hero lore...thats why ffg needed to differentiate between 'printed icon' and 'icon' in the new cards. if wisdom didnt make a hero lore then there'd be no need to make this difference

 

edit- if you still need conformation i read on a thread its in the faq somewhere about narivs belt/brand

 

edit 2- part about it being able to stay on a hero

The “Attach to...” rules text on an attachment is only a
play restriction, and is not taken into account after the
card is already attached.
 

edit 3- i read on an old thread that our very own mr.glaurung had seen Nate's clarification on that matter

Like Rich said, if it doesn't specifically say "printed resource icon" each sphere symbol on a card refers to the resource icon of a hero. Sng of Wisdom adds a lore resource icon to the attached hero, so he now belongs to that sphere and can play cards accordingly.

Got it today.

First attempt victory in three rounds solo.

Looking forward to multiplayer.

yea it does really shine in multiplayer.  when playing solo i think you kind of need to consciously decide if you want to try and breeze thru it for an awesome score or if you want to have a legitimate matchup thru picking the first location.  Selecting the old bridge in a solo game is probably the best option to ensure a full length game.  

 

I've played 2 players on it a few more times and it is honestly one of the most fun in that regard so i in no way shape or form see this quest as a disappointment

I remember I said this quest was a kind of suicide in solo mode when I made the spoilers in the other thread but honestly I was taking for granted that Old Bridge or Ancient Harbor would be the selected Location during the set up (and I was intimidated by the action of both at the same time, I didn't remember that a solo player only has to take one location).

 

As I didn't test it in solo mode, I based my feeling in suppositions. I know now that I was wrong and It's easy in solo mode if you take the Library and it seems that even with the Bridge.

 

Maybe victory points requirement would be nice to make this quest perfect.

 

I always play with other player and I have experienced the two sides of this quest, the tough one and the soft one, depending on the luck. Anyway I really like this one because it has good length at least with more players and it is enjoyable.

I really like the quest although for solo it can be quite easy. My lowest score for solo has been 40 with my beloved deck of elves (Elrond, Glorfindel, Mirlonde). I think outlands would be a nice way of challenge because you need like 3 turns to get the outlands rolling and in that time the encounder deck could get nasty. I think this is my favorite of AtS cycle so far, many options for difficulty and  incredible art.

## 23 [Tracker1 on August 13, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88236-assault-on-osgiliath-experiences/?do=findComment&comment=838084)

Choose Ancient Harbor as the location for the second game took 4 rounds and collected 5 locations 3 of which were unique.  Pretty interesting quest, but as others are saying pretty easy solo, but I think it gives you the choice to make it harder if you want, and it seems pretty fun.

 

I had one thought about  the Ancient Harbor Location, which has you for a combat action exhaust a hero to place one progress token on the location.  If i were playing Tactics Boromir, could I clear this location within the first round by exhausting and readying to place five progress?  If no other Osgiliath locations were drawn in the first round i think it would be the fastest way to win.  In fact you don't even need any other heroes.  And you would probably will with a score of +/- 20.

 

Is this Possible?

presumably yes. all you would need to do is not stage into another location.  you wouldnt even need a deck.  so automatic i dont know what the point of bothering would be

Okay, had to try it.

 

Boromir takes Osgiliath by himself with no deck.

Here is the play through.

Ancient harbor and Uruk Soldier are in the staging area to begin for 2 threat.

1st card drawn: Street Fighting - discard cards from the encounter deck until I reach an Osgiliath location.  I have the option to exhaust a hero to acquire it.  I do, and ready Boromir.  Threat at 12.

Lose questing by 2 threat at 14.

Combat action on Ancient harbor activated 5 times.  Final threat 18 

 

Final score 18 with two locations collected.

Boromir is a tank on this quest!

Here I come quest log.

 

Okay, seriously stuff like this should not happen.  Of course who is going to play it this way (besides me), but I'm not sure how designers could miss this.  I took me 3 seconds to figure it out when I looked at the card.  Unless they were aware of this problem and they were not concerned about it,  I hope that's not the case, they should be concerned.

Actually i think your score would be 29. You still have to end the current round which would add 10 threar and the standard 1 threat. Anyway crazy.

That's new to me, I've never done that.  Once I meet the conditions for wining. I thought the game was over, even before the round actually closed.  I'd be curious to know how it's played, without derailing the thread too much.  All my top scores would be 11 points higher.

Not all your quests would be 10 points higher, just this one since the victory condition requires

you to end the round. And even so, I'm still not sure too would need to add the 10 since you never start the next round. Might need an official ruling from FFG. I don't really think its a huge concern. Just to boost your own scores? Who cares

> You couls also add Old Harbor and Old Bridge at the start of the game. For one you have to exhaust a hero to make one point progress, for the other you have to pay 1 or 2 resources to make one point progress. That should keep you busy for 5-6 turns, and in that time you should have drawn the one or the other additional Osgiliath location and soome nasty enemies. I still prefer to play it two handed.

 

Those are the exact two locations I chose for my first two-handed solo play through the quest.  Mostly to start cracking away at them from the get-go instead of having one turn up mid-game and still needing the 5-6 turns to resolve  (plus each one only has a threat of 1 and since the staging area also starts out with two enemies of choice, I was worried about questing successfully on round one.)

Anyways, I had a lot of fun playing this quest for the first time and finally won just in time before my Leadership/Tactics heroes' threat got too high.  One mechanic on the Osgiliath location cards that I found to be particularly nasty was that one location makes you return it to the staging area anytime a character leaves play and for the first time I had to second guess using good-ole Gandalf.  As a whole though, most of the locations only get returned if an attack goes undefended, but I had plenty of help in that department from Boromir and Beregond.  

 

Finally, one last point I'd like to bring up is how awesome the new Knight of Minas Tirith ally is.  With a base attack of 3 that upgrades to 4 when using Leadership Boromir, this guy can really pack a punch, and once I got two in play I was decimating those filthy orcs and haradrim.

Yea I've had some good experiences with the Knight of Minas Tirith as well. If using mono tactics he's nice to pull down any enemy that starts in the staging area like Forest spider or Harbor Thug. Even if used with other spheres, 3 atk on an ally is just a nice hefty amount.

Also tried this quest two more times this morning with outlands. Lost both times; just can't set up quick enough. Maybe this quest is the decks kryptonite

For this scenario the winning condition is at the end of the round. The way i play itis that this happens after the player actions in the refresh phase and these actions happen after the threat increase and the 10 points for round. I might be wrong or missing something but perhaps an official ruling would be better.

Overall, I like this quest so far (only based on 2 play experiences so far, mind you!). It did strike me as a bit odd that there are no minimum requirements as far as how many Osgiliath locations you have to control for victory. I suppose this adds to the unpredictable nature of the quest, but it does facilitate Tactics Boromir/Ancient Harbor madness, as well as some other weirdness. I do have to say that each quest of this cycle has introduced new mechanics and really pushed the boundaries, more so than any previous cycle, and I appreciate that aspect.

My experiences with this Quest playing solo have been far easier than I anticipated at first. Granted, I have played three games starting with the King's Library and a that weak Southron who pumps for each location you control. Needless to say, I have won three games within no more than 3 turns. 

 

I have not played this Quest with multiple people, but I can only imagine how difficult it may be under those circumstances. 

 

All-in-all, I like this Quest a lot.

Starting with 4 unique locations, and 4 enemies.

 

I added enemies that have 'when reveled' effects to soften those cards a little.

 

So first round 4 harad enemies get added by Treachery. As the only test of will available was already swallowed to stop The Master's malice (I did so to not lose Arwen, So count THAT a lesson learned.) 

 

So with other draws ! Uruk and a location 

 

First round threat = 24 

 

I quested with 19 so We pump Eowyn for 4 and take 1 threat dial increase each. Travel to West gate and a Tower. 

 

Defend with some cuts and bruises and kill off a few enemies including the Lieutenant of Mordor.

 

Turn 2

 

No test of will. I cross fingers

 

Uruk Lieutenant adds the dead Uruk back from Discard pile. Orc Arbalesters, Orc War Camp and then calamity Southron support AGAIN

 

I add the Muak an Elite and the last 2 archers to the staging area.

 

I look at the 16 archery and the horde of cards ready to descend and shed a single tear for this play through.

 

I will try again :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Started playing 2 handed on this scenario (which i normally avoid since i find it very cluttered and a hassle to set up) but it has really been an absolute blast.  Really enjoying it each time i play it.  A lot of replayability IMO

Yep, 2 handed is the way to play this one. One of the best scenarios in that mode so far.

Playing 4 handed is the same as any other way

 

You just need a larger play space.   Perhaps I will take a picture of a typical set -up and link to it somehow

Played it for the first time tonight with 2 players, we lost our first attempt and won the second.   Played with a tri-sphere Boromir(tactics/Eleanor/Denethor on one side and Imrahil/Glorfindel(spirit)/Eowyn on the other.

 

For the setup in both games, we added the Lieutenant of Mordor, a Haradrim Elite, Ancient Harbor and The Old Bridge.  We discovered the same thing that others have -- tactics Boromir can claim the harbor all by himself during the combat phase.  

 

First game, we pretty well got overrun by enemies.  There was always an extra location or two in the staging area, and we just couldn't keep up.  I even discarded Boromir to end an attack in progress (against Boromir -- would have killed Boromir anyway) by killing the attacking enemy, as well as one other that we had already allowed to attack.  It was downhill after that.

 

Second game we attempted a first-turn win by using all player resources to claim The Old Bridge during Planning, and planned on using Boromir to claim Ancient Harbor during combat.  Well, staging threw another location out at us, so this wasn't to be.  That continued for three or four rounds, and meanwhile enemies started to pour out.  In the end, we had a surprising save via Power of Mordor.  There were two Osgiliath locations in the staging area, then Power of Mordor came out and replaced them all with enemies.  We ended up winning at the end of that round.  

 

I think any victory that exploits Boromir to claim Ancient Harbor is kind of a cheap victory, so we'll have to try it again more honorably.  End score was 78 with the old system, probably something like 128 or 138 if you count rounds.

Got it, play it! Very strange feeling. Good quest but looks like is not really for solo. My best shot win on the second round.

Asfaloth make amazing job since he can put tokens on active location. For solo is too easy. From 6 games i lost only one.

Sounds like need to play 2-3 plyaer game.

Definitely. 2 handed is more challenging.

Play 3 players and 2 player game. Very cool! Really interesting and fun. Solo experience very different.

I love this quest!

> Yea I've had some good experiences with the Knight of Minas Tirith as well. If using mono tactics he's nice to pull down any enemy that starts in the staging area like Forest spider or Harbor Thug. Even if used with other spheres, 3 atk on an ally is just a nice hefty amount.

I've done mono-Tactics with mono-Leadership, the former including Knight of Minas Tirith, the latter Boromir. It was was one of those very satisfying moments when the Knight pulled and killed an enemy of 1 defence strength and 3 hit points (I actually think the difference between 3 and 4 attack strength is the most important in the game, with so many enemies having 4 as their total of defence and hps).

One of the most rewarding aspects of playing mono-sphere is Master's Malice. It may still sometimes kill an envoy or watchman but in general it has turned from one of the most dreaded to the very most welcomed encounter cards.

Wow, Knights of Mina Tirith just saved my fellwoship! I played two handed (mono tactics and mono lore), got these nasty Orc Vanguard. Next turn I played KoMT, removing the Vanguard from the staging area. Then I played Forest Snare wirh my other hand.

 

Sweet! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

The decks I am using are theoretically Mono sphere.

 

However, the Spirit Rohan Deck uses Theodred and a smattering of cheap Leadership cards to generate resources. 

 

The All leadership deck also has the outlands as its' core mechanic (using Hirluin)

 

And the Elrond/Vilya deck includes Spirit Glorfindel  to get access to stargazer and test of will etc. And also a couple of high cost allies to spit out using Vilya. 

 

The tactics deck is completely Monosphere.

 

 

But unless It is late in the game you're right, Master's Malice won'tr hurt too badly.
