i'm wondering what happens if you play a card like the sword that was broken on a hero; it says the character gets a leadership icon. does the leadership icon replace the current icon, or does it let the hero keep his original resource icon and also gain a a leadership icon

I just adds an additional icon, so Aragorn (Lore) would be able to pay for both Lore and Leadership cards.
