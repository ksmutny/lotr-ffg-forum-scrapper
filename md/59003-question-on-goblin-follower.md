# [Question on Goblin Follower](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59003-question-on-goblin-follower/)

Greetings.  I am seeking clarification on the Goblin Follower from Kazad-dum expansion.

 

#1 Our new foe, the Goblin Follower engagement threat 33, states "When Revealed; Goblin Follower engages the last player".

Normally I would think that just would dictate WHICH player gets engaged during the engagement phase, BUT since it is 'When revealed", does that mean it happens immediately?  Even before the quest phase is resolved?  Even if the player's threat level is below 33?

 

#2 When East-Gate is in the active location, it says. Players cannot optionally engage enemies and no engagement checks are made.

So does the Goblin Follower's "When Revealed" effect still force an engagement while East-Gate is in play?

 

Thanks for your opinions.  This one is a bit tricky!

i would say it immediatly engages the last player (so if solo you) and does so regardless of east gate, as it isnt really an engagement check

Thanks everyone!

As a solo guy, Being First and Last Player is no fun in these quests!!

it is harsh, i agree. i was shocked at some of the rulings in khazad, but it makes it all the more challenging so cant complain
