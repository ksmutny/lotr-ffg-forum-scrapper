edit- the poll results are being added below

edit2- for the play amount and player amount see here [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=694006]

im interested to know what proportion of players are what player type, so here are the options….those who dont know the types they are basically as follows

Bilbo- theme player, loves art and tolkien, not some much bothered about winning

Pippin- loves playing with different combinations and finding new ways to make a deck, even if they dont always work

Boromir - players to win and builds a deck with this in mind

so the options are, with each option being which you favour in descending order, and ill post the results (if i get any)….they dont have to be exact, just your general play style

A - bilbo

      pippin

      boromir

 

B- bilbo

     boromir

     pippin

 

C- pippin

     Bilbo

     Boromir

Rich, the beauty of getting to know you in the forums is that your vote was purely redundant and not necessary because everyone already knows you so well!

 

Mine would be D

Pippin

Boromir

Bilbo

I'm certainly an A or B, I haven't played enough to figure out which definitively.

©

Pippin

Bilbo

Boromir

 

 

"Fool of a Took! Throw yourself in next time and rid us of your stupidity!"

 

… and in reality, Pippin and Bilbo would probably be nearly even for me with this game (or any other LOTR-themed game)…  I do love my lore, but as with most games I love playing around with possibilities that may be a stretch on what would seem "premissable" by canon…  Most games I would probably be "Pippin/Boromir/Bilbo" (for example, the lore of WoW CCG never really mattered to me).  About the only other universe that I would be concerned with game lore would be in the Star Wars games… even then, it can't hold a candle to my love of Tolkien's Tales…

 

## 7 [Zdawg88 on August 5, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/68612-player-type-poll/?do=findComment&comment=669022)

B.  For me.  I generally build decks around a general theme.  Usually around race; dwarf decks, elf decks, etc.  I still like to win though, but I usually don't play around with combos.

## 8 [shoreless on August 5, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/68612-player-type-poll/?do=findComment&comment=669031)

I'm an "F," though I sometimes pick a theme to see if I can make it competitive.

## 10 [Angus Lee on August 5, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/68612-player-type-poll/?do=findComment&comment=669053)

D - Pippin definitely, then Boromir and Bilbo will split the seond place for me, with perhaps Boromir a little bit more, since I would throw a Warden of Healing in a drawf deck for it to work better, for example.

## 11 [booored on August 5, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/68612-player-type-poll/?do=findComment&comment=669064)

Defiantly "D"

A

For the love of the game, and trying new themes. I like to win too of course, but I can appreciate beauty of game mechanics even if they smack the living crap out of me. ;-)

## 17 [Nerdmeister on August 6, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/68612-player-type-poll/?do=findComment&comment=669154)

C for me.

Not many people so far with Boromir in top. There´s room for all but I do like the friendly competition atmosphere this suggest happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]

## 18 [Glaurung on August 6, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/68612-player-type-poll/?do=findComment&comment=669166)

E  is me

Right topic! Also i think good idea to check it out community for solo or coop games.Looks like most players play solo…….maybe?

And also another question can be: how often you play the game? Once in a week or everyday?

## 19 [richsabre on August 6, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/68612-player-type-poll/?do=findComment&comment=669174)

## 21 [Quit2 on August 6, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/68612-player-type-poll/?do=findComment&comment=669297)

I am definately D

I love to try out new things and combining cards. I like to win and build a good deck, but I will definately sacrifice that to try out something new. I don't care much about theme. I think it is nice that the art is pretty, but that is not at all why I play.

## 22 [richsabre on August 6, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/68612-player-type-poll/?do=findComment&comment=669303)

 I'd have to say C (Pippin, Bilbo, Boromir) but it's a pretty even mix of the two hobbits. The ideal is a themey deck that combos well. Although I'm happy to play a little loose with theme to get fun combos going :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

## 31 [Pharmboys2013 on August 6, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/68612-player-type-poll/?do=findComment&comment=669398)

 D - Pippin

       Boromir

       Frodo

 

Make new decks constantly sometimes only using them once or twice before taking them apart for other things.  The lore of the stories is what got me into the card game in the first place so I personally dont find it important to follow the canon when building decks

## 32 [richsabre on August 6, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/68612-player-type-poll/?do=findComment&comment=669406)

## 36 [GrandSpleen on August 6, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/68612-player-type-poll/?do=findComment&comment=669460)

I'd say C.  I like trying out new cards, but it seems like the more I plan, the less I win, so I could never be a Boromir :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I'm gonna say E. I like building winning decks, and that is typically what I go for. I'm not good enough at it yet to be Pippin, I can't find the crazy combos well. And I love the art and story.

If I had to choose the letter, it would likely be B. I come to the game for the theme, I rarely play other than Tolkien games (not counting "regular" cards). And when I play I like to have a theme… but I hate not to have a strongest possible deck. What I really like about the game is that theme seems to go well with a winning strategy - at least for those factions already well developed.

## 46 [Budgernaut on August 7, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/68612-player-type-poll/?do=findComment&comment=669869)

 Really, really tough. If I absolutely have to choose an option, I suppose it's C. But that's like, 34% Pippin, 33% Bilbo, and 32% Boromir. I really have a lot more fun when I win, but my first pass at a deck build is usually centered around a new trick or a theme, then I'll tweak it later to win if I'm having a tough time with a quest.

34+33+32=99, so what's the remaining 1%?  Aragon? Elrond? Gimli? J/K

D

 

I ususally run several decks against each scenario, trying unusual pairings or building hero combos by intuition. I then bult my deck to maximize the use of my heroes. I try to win as often as possible with good results. I recently started to built themed decks, but mainly to have a new challenge, as these decks often are not as good as my other decks.

## 52 [Dain Ironfoot on August 10, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/68612-player-type-poll/?do=findComment&comment=671448)

E.

i'm not a "win at all costs" type…but i definitely build a deck with winning in mind (find it hard to believe anyone doesn't!).

so, even though i'm currently running with a dwarf deck (which could be considered thematic) it's still built to win and does get tweaked somewhat dependning on the scenario.

i've also got an "archer" deck running, which isn't thematic, but it's a fun keyword to build around. it's for multiplayer games, obviously (as ranged does little good solo, typically) but i do enjoy it.

I am constantly updating and creating new decks. It is awesome when they pwn but I love the challenge of playing the game with my favorite card instead of the cards that down right pwn.

I would say I am a D.

Pippin first,as I really like to experiment with different heroes mostly,

and though I really love Tolkien lore I wouldn't let these freekin' orcs kick my ass, ain't that right? gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]

After some time on holidays it's difficult to catch up with so much new posts in the forum, and althought I lurked a little with my smartphone now and then, there is so much left yet.

But, I couldn't let escape this poll. I have been thinking some time, and I suppose I am an A player (bilbo, pippin, boromir), but it's been a tough choice, because I would say that it should be 40% bilbo 31% pippin and 29% boromir. I love to try combinations, new decks and new interactions with cards, and I always play thinking of winning, but above all, theme is my love here. I discovered Tolkien's world so many years ago, and its works are above all in my list.

By the way, it's been a great idea to make this poll rich, so that we know each other better.

So, to sum up, mark me as A.

Greetings.

I only like theme decks.  I prefer that they win as much as possible, without sacrificing theme.

If I have to give up fun combos to achieve the top two goals, so be it.  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
