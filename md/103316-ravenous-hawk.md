The last test... what does it mean? if it is seen by 1B or 2B quest card effect.... it triggers his forced? You must engage anyway?

I thought not, but i have heard other players saying so...

It means that when you resolve the forced effect of the quest, and you see there is one or more ravenous hawk, you would put them in play engaged with you, and you still have to select a card from the remaining one to satisfy the forced effect.
