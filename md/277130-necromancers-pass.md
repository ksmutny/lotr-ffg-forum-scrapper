"Travel: The first player must discard 2 cards from his hand at random to travel here.Â " what does exactly mean random? we get to choose which cards to discard? Or we just shuffle the cards in hand and discard 2?

Shuffle and pick 2, or use whatever other randomisation method you prefer.

Also, if you have less than 2 cards in your hand, you can't travel there.
