As far as i can see (from the pdf rules contents) only saga and deluxe expansions have player cards for to add to decks.

 

Is this correct. Are so few player cards aveliable?

No, there are player cards in every adventure pack - one hero and 3 x 9 other cards.

every single expansion of every kind has player cards and encounter cards.

Just a quick clarification that all Print on Demand 'expansions' (whether they be GenCon or nightmare) only have encounter cards.  There are no player cards included in these.

There's a Lord of The Rings LCG database at the website below if you'd like to see what is offered in each expansion. I bought foundations of stone and the long dark just for the player cards that are included
