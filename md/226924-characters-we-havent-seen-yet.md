How many are left?  Let's make a master list.

## 2 [NathanH on August 6, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/226924-characters-we-havent-seen-yet/?do=findComment&comment=2348886)

There was a thread on this a while ago https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/182931-unique-characters-left-to-see [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/182931-unique-characters-left-to-see]

 

Since some of it is out of date now, I guess the current list from that post is

 

Bergil
Tom Bombadil*
Goldberry*
Iorlas
Targon
Rosie Cotton
Leaflock
Hirgon
Thranduil
Thorin III Stonehelm
The Blue Wizards (less likely)
Duinhir
Derufin
Duilin
Dervorin
Hamfast Gamgee
Húrin the Tall
Meneldor
 
There are a host of other minor Shire Hobbits not on this list; off the top of my head, Hob Hayward, Mrs Cotton, Farmer Cotton, Young Tom, Mrs Maggot, Otho, Lobelia, Lotho, Nibs, Jolly, Proudfoot, Rory Brandybuck, Old Noakes, Sandyman, Ted Sandyman, Daddy Twofoot.
 
From the Appendix there is Dis. Gilraen seems unlikely.
 
From the song at the end of the Battle of Pelennor Fields I also note Horn, Fastred, Herefara, Herubrand, Harding. I guess all Rohan. There is also Widfara who has one line in The Ride of the Rohirrim.
 
From Bree there are Nob, Bob, Harry, Mr Mugwort.
 
In Gondor I can only think of the Herb Master from the houses of healing. I have always been puzzled why the Warden of the houses of healing is not unique as well.
 
Can't think of any more, annoyingly I can't seem to find a page that lists all the characters mentioned in the books without also including the wider mythology.

There was also Angbor and Duinhir, both Gondorian/outlanders.

I feel a bit weird linking to this but I have been working on Dìs, as well as a number of other named dwarves, such as Frár, Náli, Flói, Lóni, etc. here: https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/135002/aules-legacy [https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/135002/aules-legacy]

You missed the thinking fox that noticed the hobbits while they were heading to Buckland.  Thematically, he could fit right in with the last Saga expansion if it includes the Scouring of the Shire...

I wouldn't mind seeing some Shadow of Mordor content being added somehow since much of the material used is speculative and not canon anyway.

That would be god awful.... that game whilst an amazing game completely butchers the lore and creates its own version of Middle Earth. This game sticks to the lore and is as canon as possible and instead tries to fill in the gaps and explore the unexplored parts of Middle Earth. Don't get me wrong I absolutely LOVE Shadow of Mordor but it would make no sense for content from that Game to appear in this one. If we ever got a Talion or Tauriel card for real I would straight up quit the game and never look back. As much as many different types of people play this game I think that the majority are massive Tolkien fans that love the game because of how true it stays to the source material. If that were to change I think many people would both be very dissapointed and lose much of the interest they have in this game.

Yes, but they can easily use certain ideas seen in SoM involving characters, like Celebrimbor and The Black Hand for instance, without breaching rights agreements.

If there's any game this game should take inspiration from, it's Middle Earth CCG.

Celebrimbor is dead in the timeline of the novels. His spirit it at the Halls of Mandos. Him coming back as a wraith (or helping Sauron forge the One Ring, for that matter) goes directly against Tolkien's writings.

I'm familiar with the lore. My statement on speculation is directed at the LCG, not the video game. The LCG plays with ideas not mentioned directly by Tolkien even more than SoM (save perhaps Celebrimbor). For instance, while mentioned in various texts by Tolkien, the lands of the south are no where near expanded to the extent that this LCG will be. It's filling an entire cycle of cards with, while fun, very speculative and conceptual ideas. I'm not saying put the wraith of the Silver-hand in the game but materials such as the Outcasts of Udûn or the like wouldn't hurt the lore anymore than some stuff I've seen.

You joke, but I've just read MERPs The Shire module and they turned the Fox into a minor Maia character!

As I said before, the Fox from "Three is Company" is one of my favorites.

Yeah fair enough. One of the things that I thought was best about Shadow of Mordor was the way they handled the area around the Sea of Nurn. It actually directly explained how Sauron's armies are fed and housed which was fairly interesting. If this game (LCG) were to do something somewhat similar with that part of Mordor (more green and lush than originally thought, source of food and slaves for the armies of Mordor, actually fairly populated by Men albeit either Slaves or Black Numenorians) I definitely wouldn't be upset. It makes sense for Sauron to have a portion of Mordor actually usable for food and whatnot and we have very little concrete info about that part of Mordor. 

I do have to say that I strongly disagree re the LCG playing with ideas not mentioned by Tolkien more than Shadow of Mordor.

Everything the LCG does is either based directly off the books or at least draws inspiration from the books. Even when inventing new places and enemies it uses the same languages, themes and ideas. Alternatively it will use names or concepts that are in the books but just never fleshed out or fully explained (Dwimmerlaik, Nekker Brekkers, Nameless things etc etc etc).

Any content that is completely new is at least made so that it fits the world it is set in and is feasibly possible within Middle Earth. Shadow of Mordor has created its own weird version of what happens to the Elven Fea after death and has twisted how wraiths, the ring of power and Sauron work within that world. Celebrimbor never wore or used the one ring, never raised an army of his own in Mordor and most definitely did not return to Middle Earth after his death. The core parts of Shadow of Mordor and how Celebrimbor and Talion came to be directly conflicts with how wraiths, the afterlife and the spirit world works in Middle Earth.

The LCG may expand Tolkien's work more but does so in a way in which it fits perfectly into the world it is set in and only furthers Tolkien's original vision rather than changing it.

If they haven't quit by now they're not going to (for "true to the lore" reasons).

Why do you say that? What do you think has deviated too far from the source material?

Were you one of the people who was super against sea and ship based quests...?

Lots of things have deviated, from the art (takes more queues from the movies & other franchises than actual text), to the design/function of characters (Glorfindel of all people has the lowest threat), to the mechanics of whole game itself (most successful decks involve overwhelming individually strong enemies with a horde of weak characters... not really LotR is it).

 

And it's not like there isn't already a Tauriel card.

He may have the lowest starting threat but just questing with him raises threat every time. I know LoV gets around this but just on his own as a card he is fairly thematic as he raises threat (gaining the attention and focus of the enemy) just by simply being around and partaking in the quest at hand at all.
My decks focus on several strong characters with multiple attachments and multiple readying effects. I don't run that many weaker allies and those that I do serve very specific functions. Yes many decks focus on ally swarming but there are all sorts of powerful decks including many that do not use a horde of weak characters and instead focus on several key characters becoming absolute beasts or even just one (Boromir and Gandalf).
Even with strong buffed up characters you do need to use multiple attackers to take out stronger foes but that is just sort of the nature of a card game like this one. If our characters were beasts and had similar stats to enemies at the start of a quest there would be no challenge. Once you get an attachment heavy deck going however you can easily use a single hero to defend against or destroy multiple enemies per turn which is extremely satisfying and a bit more thematic.
I do see where you are coming from and somewhat agree in regards to some of the art we get as well as the horde of weak characters argument however it is inevitable that the art is at least somewhat influenced by the movies and you can easily use decks that avoid swarms of allies but are still strong. I think that most of the things that can make gameplay seem unthematic can easily be avoided with the right decks. Where is the Tauriel card?

Maybe he has low starting threat because he died fighting that Balrog, and the Enemy doesn't realize he's back from the Halls of Mandos so quickly (presumably the Witch-King didn't tell Sauron all the details of the Battle of Fornost).

He chases Ringwraiths around the countryside for fun, The Enemy is well aware that he's alive and kicking.

Only because the game is designed as it is. In this system, for balance reasons your average Orc needs to be stronger than your average character, because the player can (if they choose) easily control more characters on the board than the encounter deck can provide.

 

Now everyone knows all but the most exceptional Orcs in the LotR are weak, malnourished fodder for mighty heroes like Aragorn, Boromir and Sam. Even the biggest breeds are "almost man-high", not the muscle-bound creatures of your Skyrim or WoW. The Orcs considered killing Boromir while losing dozens of their number to him alone a big accomplishment.

 

Enemies like Ringwraiths aren't deadly combatants, either. Their power likes in terror and otherworldy such and such. Aragorn and Glorfindel couldn't stand against The Nine all at once, but 4 or 5, sure. 

 

 

A more true to lore system would involve weak enemies and strong heroes as part of its core design. But this is closer than that "hobbits race each other to Mt. Doom" thing they're peddling at least.
