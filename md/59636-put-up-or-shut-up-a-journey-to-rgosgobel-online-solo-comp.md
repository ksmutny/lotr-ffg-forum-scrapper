# [Put up or Shut Up - A JOURNEY TO RGOSGOBEL (online solo comp)](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59636-put-up-or-shut-up-a-journey-to-rgosgobel-online-solo-comp/)

Look there is a lot of talk about this.. and honestly I think a lot of it is bull, how can peopel not think this quest is super hard solo.. Personally I think this quest is VERY hard solo, especially when you have a limited card pool.. Now lets put a end to this...

2 Competitions.

 * 1xRestricted
 * 1xRestricted+SOM

Rules: Restricted

 * You have to play 5 games total and ONLY 5 NO MORE.. 5 GAMES TOTAL!
 * You can use 1 copy of CORE + HFG + CATC + AJTR
 * Post your results for each game... Score / Heroes + Anything else you want to add.

Rules: 1xRestricted+SOM

 * You have to play 5 games total and ONLY 5 NO MORE.. 5 GAMES TOTAL!
 * You can use 1 copy of CORE + All cards from Shadows of Mirkwood ONLY
 * Post your results for each game... Score / Heroes + Anything else you want to add.

Then I will add it all up and use Petes or RGun's averaging system to get a meta score for us all.. Winner and 2 runner ups will be asked to post their decks.

LET'S END THIS NOW!!! - IS A JOURNEY TO RGOSGOBEL REALLY HARD FOR NEW PLAYERS?

If people get into this we will do it again this time with no restrictions on how many copies of core there is..

Time to put your money where your mouth is... stop calling "easy / hard" and lest see it in action.
 

NOTE TO CHEATING - There is no way we can stop you from cheating... but just don't.. come on.. if you embarrassed make a new account and post under that name or something.. you can ONLY play 5 games per round . no more... no less... you can not play the set 10 times and give your best score....The fail rate is a massive part of what we are trying to look at here.

this really isnt going to do much for my standing in the forum lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif], but it wont be joining in, as soon as i see competition i fade out........anyways this seems way too a hostile comp.....in the red corner we have rhosgobel is easy and in the blue corner......

also after all my opinions on this when people said journey i was actually refering to journey down the anduin, which is why i was confused people were saying it was easy for beginners......yes it is late, still never mind, i dont usually check competition threads, but i will never the less watch this one with interest

I think most people would agree that Journey to Rgosgobel is one of the harder quests (it does have a 6 rating), especially solo.  That being said, I don't think a second core set is required to enjoy and play any of the quests solo, including this one.  I have won all playing solo except Escape from Dol Guldor using the restricted rules (i.e. only use cards available at the time the scenario was released) although my win percentage on the harder ones is down around 15-20%. Lord of the Rings is my first experience with deck building games and I definitely do not consider myself an expert deck builder so I expect there is much I could do better to improve my win % significantly.  

Personally, I like a difficult challenge, provided a win is not impossible so I find the difficulty just right for me.  I enjoy learning and seeing the results as my deck building skills increase, as well as discovering more optimal strategies for dealing with each specific quest. I also like the fact that playing as a solo player, the decks and strategies really need to be tailored to each specific quest and I also like to see the impact that the new cards have on quests previously played using the restricted rules.

That being said, if I was going to play competitively then there is no doubt I would want 3 copies of some of the key cards.

Everyone has different tastes so there is no right answer for everyone, but my advice would be if you like a challenge and aren't going to be playing competitive tournaments than no need to get a second core set.  If you don't enjoy losing a significant amount of the time and don't enjoy fiddling with your deck but want to play solo then I would recommend staying away from the quests with a difficulty higher than 5 (or just play those ones with 2 or more players).

Well this isn't a "completion".. it is just a friendly game, to see exactly what people are saying... IMO, a lot of the "difficulty" bitching is not that some players are better, it is that they just do not see loosing as a problem. AjtR is one of my fav quest in the game for solo. I have had more fun trying to build a consistent deck to this quest than nearly any other. Like you say you are on about a 15-20% win ratio on some of the harder quests... that sounds about right to me.. but I do not see that as a problem.. while others do.

This is just to see what other people are doing, especially with a single core restricting them.

Excited you are hosting this booored. I'm looking forward to seeing how the results play out.

Do you have a set time frame for people to get their 5 plays in, or will it be open ended?

Honestly, the idea of an ongoing, open-ended (living, if you will) competition is very intriguing to me.

I want to play around with that idea and make a separate post about it.

In the mean time, I'm curious about your plans for this one here.

Well I give up, I just played about 20 games over course of the entire day and didn't win a single one.. would love to see these decks that supposedly can beat this quest Solo with 1 copy of Core and just the restricted card set.

I tried this around xmas, played two or three times back-to-back and just got angered by Wilyador letting me down by dying, **** him! I might get inspired this weekend to give this a try, though I'm not one for keeping track of exactly what happened during games, so may not be able to fully participate. But I'll be keen to see the responses roll in!

Try using Denethor and Eleanor.  Denethor is particular is key to winning some of the quests solo.  He lets you see the top card of the encounter deck, and move it to the bottom if need me.  If it is an "ok" encounter card than you leave it and you know exactly how many characters you can quest with.  If it's a card with a "killer" effect then you move it to the bottom.  Eleanor lets you cancel bad events.  If you get Unexpected Courage on Denethor than he is really good because he can get you out of trouble twice, or ready again and defend after he deals with the encounter card.  He is very powerful playing solo because just one encounter card is flipped from the deck each time so with him in play you usually know exactly what you will see (except when there is a card with surge).  Obviously, Lore of Imladris is key as well.

yeah well that is all obvious and has been said a billion times before...

The point of this is for people to put up or shut up and post their decks if they can do it. The real question is can you win once in 5 games. Though in retro, it should have been 3. The LoTR forum is full of people going on about "how easy" it is and offering advise, shooting down others for saying it is super hard... but there is still doubt that skill and deck building makes any difference at all, and it is all just really the luck of the encounter deck draw.

Witch is why Juice and co are spending sop much time trying to work out a score system that takes loosing into account.

If you think you have a deck that can run it.. then do it.. Lets see it in action.. instead of just another post of telling us how it should be done.. cause bottom line.. I do not believe it. or if your to chicken to put your money were your mouth is.. just post the deck for others to try... this "blanket advise that is in like every 2nd thread" is useless.

Attempt One: fail.
Lore/Leadership deck, using Glorfindel, Bilbo and Theodred. I'm using cards from the whole Mirkwood cycle (and one core set).

When it was all over, the state of play was thus:
- Finishing Threat 35
- Glorfindel and Theodred both had athelas
- Wilyador still had 7 wounds on him
- Used Lore of Imladris, and attached Self Preservation to Wilyador to heal him of 7 wounds, and also used 5 resources amassed by Radagast to do so. 



(As I go on, I'll edit this post with the results of subsequent games)

Are we supposed to use the same deck for all 5 attempts?

No, you can change your decks and heroes between games (but not between Emyn Muil and Rhosgobel). I plan to use a different combo for my last shot and already made some small corrections in my deck after my first game.

## 15 [plueschi2 on January 28, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59636-put-up-or-shut-up-a-journey-to-rgosgobel-online-solo-comp/?do=findComment&comment=586077)

 Interesting idea.

 

My answer in short: Is JtR really hard for new players? Yes. Is it still hard after you gained some experience? Less so.

 

I think the one Core Set restriction has a big impact on the difficulty of the quest, not like "If you can win it", but "how reliable do you win it". A third copy of Sneak Attack, Steward of Gondor, A Test of Will and other cards will go a long way of making you win more reliable.

 

That being said, I consider myself in the "quest is not too hard" corner (but I honestly don't know how hard it is with one Core Set, I have two). So I would like to put my hat in the ring and play some games with your restrictions. But instead of just posting some scores, maybe someone here is willing to meet up with me while I play those games on LackeyCCG (Tragic should be releasing JtR sometime early February, right?).

 

Just two questions upfront: Winning consistently trumps any score, right? And what is considered a good outcome? 2/5, 3/5 or 4/5?

Thx in advance.

just a second though......this is for the new players right??? to see how they fare against it?  wont all this be a little overwhelming for them? i mean what are we calling new anyways? and wont the new players be a bit imtimidated about just coming to the game, not really knowing their ways about the game, then getting blasted by the nature of this competition

also the majority of 'new' players on here have id say at least 3 months experience, i havnt seen many people join recently, and those who have have made the threads regarding help for JTR, so will have access to decks pre made....

for instance im pretty sure i told someone a deck that i won easily with twice in a row, but hey, im not competiting, so the rules of this thread dont let me talk about it unless im going to enter with itlengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif]

Yes. You need to use the same deck in all games.

There is a no competing, this is just for fun and a way to judge the validity of this as a "solo game". The entire point is for people to step up and show us what you got.. saying you "got a deck that works.. but oh wait I'm to much a a blow hard chicken to play and post because in reality the deck can NOT do it... as there is NO deck that can do it because it is all just about how lucky your encounter draw is and has NOTHING to do with deck building or skill" is the entire point of the thread. Thanks for proving it.

New players find this game hard, they come to the forum and then they post "hey this is hard" then there is a billion posts saying "oh. .you beat it like this".. "this is easy".." do it this way".. and I think most of those posts are full of it.. so basically the fact that you can not be bothered to play a few games over the course of a few days of a game you supposedly love.. makes pretty much every one of your posts the exact butt of the joke that this thread is highlighting.

oh you just love to push dont you booored? not everyone in the world has you attitude towards life....i know about 2 dozen people like you, always trying to prove something, not everyone plays to win, plays to prove a point, i have no point to prove, you think you can judge me half way across the world? man you have some skill, i wish i was like you i seriously do

thanks for your infinite wisdom as per usual, but i think i will be the judge of how much i love something or not

believe it or not you do not need to take part in any form of competition or tournament or player created whatever... to enjoy this game, it has other aspects, aspects which i think many people on this forum either 1. dont care about or 2. are so lost up in what win or loses they have forgotten this game is about possibly the best peice of literature ever created, which you know is fine, but they should remember some people play it for that reason, you know there was a time when this forum actually was a friendly respectful place, where you could have a mature discussion without resorting to trolling for a reaction, but.....i guess times change eh?

also i think your signature says alot about your character....why dont you try for once not to purposely p*ss people off who are genuinly here to enjoy themsleves

this forum has seriously taken a significant leap down the sh*tter over the last few weeks

Me too, so don't worry about it.  Part of the learning curve.

Boooored---hey, you are correct, there is no one deck that can beat this consistently 100% of the time, because too much depends upon both encounter draws and player hands/card draw.  Anything I have said in the forums, was simply meant to help someone out who was having problems winning at all.  It is hard, but there are ways to increase your chances in winning, and perhaps that is how it should have been said!

Atttempt 1: Success

Using 1 x core and shadows of Mirkwood.  A Lore deck with Bilbo, Denethor and Glorfindel, using no Gandalfs or Radagasts

 

Game lasted 13 turns winning on turn 14, used 3 Lorer of Imladris and 3 Athelas

Final threat 43  Score 165

Cant help but think this was very lucky due to getting all 3 Lore of Imladris over 5 turns in the middle of the game.

I'll give this a try. Not because I care about any side (JtR is too easy or JtR is too hard), but simply because it makes for a challenge and an occasion to compare scores and results with other players.

I bought each expansion as it came out and have played with 3 Core sets since before The Hunt for Gollum was released, but I went for a long period without playing. By the time I tried JtR for the first time, I had all the Mirkwood cycle of AP. I used my Lore deck (Beravor, Bilbo, Denethor using Songs to splash) and got destroyed on my first try. That was a generic deck designed to do well against any quest (and it worked up to that point). But ahainst JtR, I was always behind with that eagle. The clock is fast in this quest! My second try was with a friend in 2 players (Gimli-Eowyn-Brand / Bilbo-Beravor-Gloin) and we won easily. The fact that we got 2 Athelas in the first 2 turns was a major point (and I had added Lore of Imladris to my deck, a card I didn't play before this quest came out).

I then only played it a few more times. Once as a 4 player team (won in 3 or 4 turns), once as a 2 player team with the Zigil deck (again, a fast and easy win) and a few times this weekend as part of Zjb12's tournament, which doesn't really count since I won it in 2 turns each time.

So, I'm looking forward to trying this. I must say those challenges of playing with a single Core set make for a change, but I'll probably tire of them soon. Maybe I'm lazy, but I do enjoy having my 3-of for most spells (A Test of Will, Galadhrim's Greetings), especialy Unexpected Courage. Having 3 or only 1 of that attachment completely changes the game (obviously, the game is easier with 3).

I built 2 decks to try. One is Spirit / Lore (Eowyn, Eleanor, Denethor). I already tried 2 games and loss both. I'm always a turn late in getting an Athelas or my Lore of Imladris. I'll post complete results later.

The second deck is built to fight. I use Eleanor, Frodo and Legolas. I splash Lore for Lore of Imladris, but the rest includes more Eagles and ranged allies in order to better fight the enemies.

My assumption in both cases, after reviewing the encounter deck, is that you don't need major questing since most cards have only 1 or 2 threar (there's Necromancer's Pass and Ungoliant's Spawn as the exception). However, what I'm realizing now is that you still want a lot of questing speed to get to the end soon. Every turn is 2 more points of damage and you quickly run out of options. In my two tries, I had to use Lore of Imladris when Wyliador was up to 18 or 19 damage.

I'm beginning to think you need a solid alignment of planets on this quest. As in: getting early Athelas and having the right cards in your hand. This reminds me of Escape from Dol Guldur (at least from the solo perspective) The quest becomes way easier the more players you have, since the clock on Wyliador doesn't scale, but you get to see more cards from the encounter deck and can thus get Athelas sooner (solo, you'll see 9 encounter cards before Wyliador dies; two players will see 18; etc.).

Anyway, I hope to see other people post results and strategy. The fact that you can design a deck just for this quest should make it easier, but it doesn't make much of a difference right now for my tries.

Attempt 2: Fail

Glorfindel died on turn 5 having taken 2 damage from the arrival of Dol Guldor Orcs on turn 4, swarming insects and festering wounds finished him off the next turn leaving the other two heroes to die a slow lingering death over the next 5 turns.  Bilbo died next on turn 7 from an undefendable Black Forest Bat and finally poor old Wilyadir succumbed to his wounds on turn 10, In spite of a Lore of Imladris and Denethor having 2 Athelas.  Basically it was an unlucky run of treacheries wot did me in.

I changed my deck for this before the rules were clarified. So:

Attempt 1a: fail

This time, I used a Lore/Tactics deck, Bilbo, Denethor and Legolas. 
- End threat: 39 (Game ended because Wilyador snuffed it)
- Denethor took 2 wounds from an undefended Dol Guldur Orc attack; Festering Wounds then did him in.
- Swarming Insects wounded everyone (and killed Daughter of the Nimrodel) for one, then...
- Bilbo was caught in a web, a second Swarming Insects killed him off, as well as sweeping up a couple more of my allies.
- As a last-ditch effort, I managed to bring out Eagles of the Misty Mountains for a questing-boost, but before long, it was all over.

I think its likely, although with Bilbo thats 3 Lore of Imladris over 10 cards rather than 5

My Radagasts do that too.  Even though I split them up before shuffling

Denethor killed by Ungoliants spawn and then a hummerhorn shadow effect from a different combat on the same turn

10 Turns (won in Turn 11)

A fast hitched Bilbo ended up with all 4 Athelas

A real nail biter to the end, I got the first 3 Athelas out early but was struggling to get through the quest due to treacheries killing off my allies and a mid game ungoliants spawn.  Got 2 Lore of Imladris, second one with Gleowine in a last bid attempt when Wyliador was on 19 damage.  Only had 12 cards left in my draw deck.  Shadow of the past was critical to recover an Athelas that was discarded as a shadow card.

 

Game 4: Defeat

Lost turn 7 when a combination of Ufthak and Ungoliants spawn finished off my heros already badly wounded from their many festering insect wounds.  Didnt make it past phase 1 due to lack of questing power due to need to defend against the stream of monsters.

Hopefully I will get to game 5 tommorrow

 It's too bad I didn't see this thread earlier. I actually just came online to post that I had beat JtR for the first time earlier today!

I used Denethor, Beravor, and Eowyn

It won on my very first try!

Denethor used his special ability every turn and Beravor used hers on almost every turn. This let me avoid most of the nasty encounter cards and get through my deck quickly (I also got Gleowine out pretty early), which let me get enough of my Lore of Imladris cards to keep Wilydor's damage pretty low.

I had never even beaten JtR in multi-player and this was my second attempt at trying to tailor a deck specifically for this quest.

Gatharion: Care to post a decklist? Also, please indicate the card pool you used (How many Core Sets? Which expansions did you use?).

I'm still struggling with the "restricted" format Boooored came up with; wondering how useful Beravor would be (or Bilbo). For now, I've focused more on "getting the Athelas" (Denethor) and fighting the enemies than on getting my own Lore of Imladris.

Crap. I just tore that deck apart. It had lots of Lore cards. Haldir of course, to help defend against the Mirkwood Flock. Most of the Spirit cards were about avoiding Encounter card effects like Test of Wills and Hasty Stroke. Also the Spirit event that let me shuffle my discard pile back into my deck. I used a Forest Snare when two Mirkwood Flocks were down. A Miner of the Iron Hills got rid of a Caught in a Web. I played a Radagast, but all he did was help quest while Eowyn was Caught in the aforementioned Web; he had three tokens on him at the end, but I didn't need them.

I have a single core set and all of the Mirkwood expansions.

After  being forced to play this adventure again, my advice for new solo players is:

 

1) Don't buy another core because Rhosgobel is too hard for you

 

because

 

2) Rhosgobel isn't hard, it's just annoyingly depending on drawing two certain cards and designed for multiplayer

 

so

 

3) put Rhosgobel to some place you have no easy acess to and forget that it ever existed

 

and

 

4) play lottery instead

 

 

In two games I was lucky and drew the required cards, in three games I wasn't. That's why I won 2 out of 5 games. I didn't even have a proper deck (was too lazy to look for tactics cards, so my deck included only spirit and lore cards).

 

Heroes were Legolas, Glorfindel and Denethor. Results were 93, L, L, 117, L.

I'm sure there's a way to come up with a winning strategy against this quest, even using the restricted card pool. Obviously, it'll always remain luck-dependant (more so than other quests) because of the search for Athelas that his harder in solo, but it doesn't mean it's unbeatable.

II just played my 5 games using the restricted card pool (one Core set, cards up to Journey to Rhosgopel). Here are my results:

Game # 1 - Loss
Game # 2 - Loss
Game # 3 - Win: 28 threat + 0 dead hero + 0 wound - 4 victory points + (4 rounds * 10) = 64
Game # 4 - Win: 25 threat + 0 dead hero + 5 wounds - 4 victory points + (7 rounds * 10) = 96
Game # 5 - Loss

Notes on the games

Game # 1 - I lost due to a lack of Lore resources and meeting more enemies than locations. That proved to be an issue for me in all games. My drawing engine was based on Ancient Mathom, so I needed early locations to activate it. Also, since I always needed one or two Lore of Imladris to win, that meant holding on to Lore resources on Denethor.

Game # 3 - I had a sneaky Gandalf and Escort from Edoras to boost my questing power and I met locations which helped me fill my hand with all three Lore of Imladris. I also got a free Athelas when it was guarded by Driven by Shadows.

Game # 4 - This was the most interesting one. I had one Athelas, 5 resources on Radagast, a second Athelas being guarded by Necromancer's Pass in the staging area, a Lore of Imladris in hand (but no resource on any hero), a Steward of Gondor on Eowyn and 14 wounds on Wyliador. I had to decide whether I traveled or not. I chose not to, not wanting to risk my Lore of Imladris. Instead, Wyliador went to 16 wounds while I played a Northern Tracker of the 4 spirit resources (1 from Eleanor, 3 from Eowyn). Wyliador went up to 18 resources on the next turn when I finished exploring the Pass with Northern Tracker, grabbed the Athelas and healed the eagle for 20.

Game # 5 - The only Athelas I saw was guarded by a Chieftan Ufthak which prooved to strong for my army (Gandalf did his best to help from afar, but being alone, it wasn't enough).

Thoughts and ideas:

- You want to finish this quest early. The worst situation is when you have enough resources to fully heal the eagle, but just can't get to the end of stage 2B. So that means heavy questing power. Cards such as Escort from Edoras becomes stronger than they usualy are.

- There are 4 cards that can heal Wyliador: Lore of Imladris, Radagast, Glorfindel and Athelas. You want all 4 in multiple copies (well, not Glorfindel...). Cards that prevent damage to Wyliador should be seen in the same light: A Test of Will, Hasty Stroke, A Burning Brand (if you can have a ranged Lore hero), Eleanor and, to a lesser degree, Denethor and Unexpected Courage (and Common Cause).

- Because you want to finish early, you won't have a lot of resources. It means each resource must be maximized. I'd remove cards such as The Galadhrim's Greetings and Protector of Lorien. Although "good" in a generic sens, these become less useful when you cannot afford to cast them (the only time I played GG was when I had already clinched my win in game 4, although I had it in all games). Protector could be considered if not playing Eowyn, but you'll see that you don't have enough cards to throw away to make it very effective.

I'll try it with the other deck I spoke of earlier (Eleanor, Frodo, Legolas), but I don't expect any more success.

I'll see if I feel like trying further later based on these findings.

I'd keep Protector. You're right about GG, you also don't need Gandalf for lowering your threat. I used him to draw more cards, which was key to win game 2. You should consider to inlude Strength of Will. No cost for 2 progress.I alwas used Escort to activate it.

Agreed on Gandalf. I used him to either draw or shoot down an enemy I had no other way of dealing with.

I just went for another go with a different deck (same Restricted format; 1 x Core Set and only expansions up to JtR).

The results:

Game # 1 - Loss
Game # 2 - Win: 35 threat + 0 dead hero + 1 wound - 4 victory points + (11 rounds * 10) = 142
Game # 3 - Loss
Game # 4 - Loss
Game # 5 - Win: 36 threat + 0 dead hero + 5 wounds - 4 victory points + (8 rounds * 10) = 117

Decklist:

Hero (3)
Eleanor (Core) x1
Frodo Baggins (CatC) x1
Legolas (Core) x1

Ally (21)
Eomund (CatC) x1
Escort from Edoras (AJtR) x3
Gandalf (Core) x3
Horseback Archer (Core) x1
Landroval (AJtR) x1
Lorien Guide (Core) x2
Miner of the Iron Hills (Core) x1
Northern Tracker (Core) x2
Radagast (AJtR) x3
Wandering Took (Core) x1
Westfold Horse-Breaker (THfG) x2
Winged Guardian (THfG) x1

Attachment (14)
Ancient Mathom (AJtR) x3
Blade of Gondolin (Core) x1
Horn of Gondor (Core) x1
Song of Kings (THFG) x3
Song of Wisdom (CatC) x3
Steward of Gondor (Core) x2
Unexpected Courage (Core) x1

Event (15)
A Test of Will (Core) x2
Dwarven Tomb (Core) x1
Feint (Core) x2
Hasty Stroke (Core) x2
Lore of Imladris (Core) x3
Quick Strike (Core) x1
Sneak Attack (Core) x2
Stand and Fight (Core) x2

Although I didn't have much more success, I felt I had a better chance in each games. It could be that I'm beginnig to get a feel for the quest itself. My games lasted longer; I often ended up using multiple Radagast to heal Wyliador and buy me a few turns. Game # 4 was a sad loss. I only realized afterward that Legolas's ability is a response (thus optional) and I could have killed a few enemies without problem. I was looking for my 3rd Lore of Imladris (used the other two earlier) and drew 6 cards off Ancient Mathoms with maybe 10 cards left in my deck, but still couldn't get one. I also searched a while for Athelas in that one; over half the encounter deck was passed before I found my first. But once I got the location that lets you fetch one, it was guarded by a second Athelas. Anyway, a great game that was.

Question: If you get an Athelas and the guarding card is a Treachery that you cancel with Eleanor, will the replacement card still be guarding Athelas? I assume no, but I'm not certain.

Amongst the other comments I can make, that second deck performed better because I rarely felt I was overwhelmed by the encounter deck. Sure, Chieftan Ufthak is still a beast, but I could fight most enemies with Legolas and was letting undefended attacks go through, confident in Frodo's ability to survive. I also got Steward of Gondor out early in most games; having the 3 Song of Kings was critical. One of the issues I have, however, is the amount of "unused" cards I ended with (extra copies of Songs, Tactics allies I couldn't play). Maybe a Protector of Lorien would have been welcome after all...

Amongst the changes I would make to this deck, there's the removal of Landroval and Horseback Archer. I'd certainly add a second Quick Strike and the third Westfold Horse-Breaker instead. The Blade of Gondolin never showed its use. A third Stand and Fight would be better, I think.

I may give this one a last try, with a Glorfindel / Eleanor / Beravor deck (splashing Leadership for Sneak Attack and Steward of Gondor). After that, enough!

I am having a lot of fun with this myself.. I haven't got time for a full report right now but will when I get home from work.. I just want to say my deck is "almost" exactly like Sicks.. but a little more conservative I think .. also HillariousPete saw my deck yesterday b4 sick posted just in case the thought police are about! I did a lot of play testing and building over the weekend, and I honestly think this "deck" is the only option for constant scores.. and I find it terrible interesting that your deck is nearly exactly the same.

I build my decks pretty much always in the same fashion.

I decide on the heroes (or at least decides on the spheres I want these heroes to be part of), figure out a few items or themes I want to exploit (ex: in this scenario, it would include Healing, Ranged combat and Treachery defense) and then I use the deckbuilder on CardGameDB.com to build. I start by doing a "search" on all existing cards and I go from top to bottom, adding 3 (or whatever number is made possible by the rules) of each card I want to potentialy play.

I find that website very useful because it tells you which expansion each card is a part of, so it's easy to see what is valid or not based on the restriction you want to use.

Once I've gone through the list, I now have "my" pool of cards. I start cutting down to get to 50. I usualy want at least 20 allies, but I don't have any specific ratio in mind for Events or Attachments.

You should try the Deck Builder By Zorbec... [http://eric.minet.free.fr/lotrbuilder/dbdownl_en.htm]

It has everything you want.. Click "Filters" and you can remove APs from the Card Pool. It tells you the amount of cards that core had of each card. You have super advanced filters. Personally I like grouping by TYPE/SPHERE/TITLE, but for special times you can sort by cost, will, defense etc etc etc. In the Filter section you can filter to only show ranged, or Dwarfs .. or w/e...

It is really an amazing tool.. it even has a draw engine so you can test your opening hands and stuff. As well as a advanced "statistics" were you get pie graphs and all sorts of stuff for what is in your deck..

On top of that you can open the encounter deck (use all the same filters) so you can see the encounter cards while you build your deck..

Just THE best tool ever.

Oh, it can also output to text files for posting decks on forums, and even output to LackeyCCG

I played 5 games.

Wins: 5

Every game went 11 rounds with 0 threat and 0 wounds. Victory points: three games with 4, one with 7 and one with 13.

Heroes: Frodo, Beravor and Eleanor.

"same as before" - Your other deck list is not in this thread that I can see... How did you deal with The Bats and the Crows? I can nto see your deck, but I assume your using a leadership splash so you are running the leadership archer? Still 2xSpirit+1xLore.... how did you handle Bats and Crows.. no way you played 5 games and got no Crows and Bats.

Just to check you are using a single copy of core? So only 1 UC (makes Beravor not the draw engine she is usally used for ... why Bilbo is in thiese posted decks... though the +1 Will dose count at the start... and you can only have 2 copies of Test of Will for example.

Thanks for confirming about the decklist.

Was Dunedain Cache that critical to your victories? I don't think the main point of this thread was to score high; the big point was mostly to find a deck with a high win % using the restricted format for the JtR quest. With 100 %, yours sure did better than mine and anyone else's deck reported until now (in this thread).

Kudos!

Next "event", I'll give a shot to this Beravor / Draw all your deck strategy if possible.

I hope until we start the next event we will have found a solution to break this deck. If that's not the case , I hope everybody her is man/dwarf/elf enough not to use a deck that is based on exploiting a major designer error.

Muemaken's result were based on a single Core set. Obviously, using more copies of Unexpected Courage just makes the deck even better. But that's why I want to try his versions. I've played "draw your whole deck" before, but using 3 Core sets. I want to see how effective it is without those extra UC. Also, my version was mono-lore with Bilbo, Beravor and Denethor and depended on peeking at the deck (I played this version at the time of CatC). I want to try the concept with a multi-sphere heroes deck.

Leptokurt: I think the point of this specific challenge was to "prove" it was possible to beat consistently the JtR quest with a "restricted" pool of cards, which Muemaken seems to have done. Booored's restrictions didn't include a "don't use Beravor" clause.

To each challenge its own rules. I don't see why we should prevent ourselves from using winning strategies when playing what amounts to an online tournament.

Right, Game 5 lost in 9 turns. 

Couldnt find any Lore of Imladris or Athalas only streams of unpleasant event cards.

That gives me a 40% win rate over 5 games

Well, I I need to re-think this and start from scratch... I believe I have built a deck that is as good as possible be given the restrictions AND the direction I chose for deck building. I will go though the deck and explain it.. and with a few modifications though the addition of the cards from the entire Mirkwood cycle, witch are banned in this challenge, this deck and the strategy that goes with it reaches, nearly, a perfect win ratio.

Still, ironically the fact that this deck is so "safe" is also its downfall, and strange as it may sound a more risky deck, might have a better chance of seceding with a higher win ratio. I know that sounds off.. but bear with me. You see this deck is designed to cope with the crazy when revealed effects in this quest, the 2 super monsters (Spawn and Chief) as well as the Condition Attachment effect and shadow effects. So this deck fears not all that crazy draw. It is meant to cope with these upsets, and it copes VERY well. Running this deck properly is a bit complex, as you need a honed threat assessment, but you are fairly certain to always get to near the end of 2B. The problem is that by being able to cope with everything, it is also weak in other key areas, areas you can not shore up with out making it susceptible to surprise draws. This was frustrating the hell out of me, and I have come to the conclusion that the way to get around this is to build a deck that IS open to disaster on certain draws. Rather than trying to be able to cope with everything. My hope is that by completely ignoring some threats I will increase the chance of winning when those threats do not show up.. meaning a guaranteed loss if they do, but if they do not .. maybe more chance of a win... As the threats are spread out and rareish... I think there is the possibility of increasing the win ratio by doing this.. by doing what is essentially building a "worse" deck.. pretty interesting I think..

Here is the deck that I have been running, and would greatly like any input you care to give....

Heroes

(T) Legolas

 * This guys is in fact the key quester of this deck, though enemy kills using his ability combo'd with duel Blade of Gondolin. He can bock and attack those common bats and crows, as well as cast key Tactic Sphere defensive tricks, like Feint and Winged Guardian.

(S) Eleanor


 * She is the real hero in this deck, her ability to cancel the treachery cards is key. Nearly every single treachery will end the game in one move. We are only allowed 2 Test of Wills, and 1 Tomb, so using these cards just isn't enough. In my test games drawing 3 treachery in a row was common. I honestly can not see how this quest is even remotely achievable with out her. As well as canceling, she is able to speed up the encounter deck draw, as each cancel draws a new card witch is critical to getting those healing objective cards.

(L) Bilbo Baggins

 * This guy is a card draw machine. I strongly feel that with Elenore as the UC target, for treachery canceling and only one UC able to be used, that Bilbo far exceeds Beravore for card draw. As he can draw an extra card every turn regardless of how you use him, in the long run over the course of the game he will always draw more than Beravore, though it is true that if you play Beravore correctly (as in tapping at end of turn) you can draw your 2 cards then, 1 from refresh and have the ability to draw an extra two strait away when you are digging for a card. This is Bilbos weakness, he speeds up card draw but he is not a digger, and if you get to the end of the quest and haven't the heals, each turn putting 2 wounds, Bilbos effect can not really cut it. Still, with Legolas defending or attacking and Elenore untapped for treachery protection, you want your 3rd hero questing all the time, with makes Beravore tap ability useless. So that is why Bilbo

I'll list the deck at the end.. but first lets talk strategy.

3x Westfold Horse-Breaker


 * Is a gold mine... at cost of 2 you get 1 will. That isn't much.. but remember the encounter deck starts at 1, and reveals 1 at a time, so after you can quest for around 4-6... that is ALL you need to keep on top of the questing. What is great about this character is that you can discard it to untap Elenore to get an extra cancel running, or for a surprise attack by un-tapping Legolas. This card is a life saver, so much utility and I can not count the times it has completely saved the day.

1x Henamarth Riversong


 * As we can only use 1 copy of core (I own 3 btw) I am shocked at how hard this game is with only 1 copy of this complete legend. Being able to see what is coming in the encounter deck is just ... I dunno.. I can not express how great that is. Easily THE best card to get near the start of the game. So integral to the deck, that I have even placed a stand and fight in to bring back Zombie Rivedrsong in the late game.

2x Miner of the Iron Hills


 * There is a condition attachment that stops you form untapping. These guys simply let me get rid of it. You can also sack this guy in a ground attack if you wish to bring him back with Stand and Fight. 2 is possibly too many copies as it is a rareish occurrence, and is an example of what I was saying at the start about this deck being "too" prepared.

2x Forest Snare / 2x Feint


 * There is a Chieftain, a Spawn and 2x Dol Orcs in this set.. The 1st 2 will wreak you, though I have removed them a few times, but the Dol Orcs even though easy to kill get 2 shadow cards, and the shadow cards are deadly. There is the +3 dmg to Wilyador card.. witch effectually decreased your clock in the game by a turn.. and there is the +1 Wound to all exhausted Characters this kills most allies.. and you have to remember that you tap to defend, so often this will kill the defender, leaving the attack undefended.. brutal. Then there is also the +1 dmg to all wounded characters.. again.. this can wipe the entire board. So the Dol Orcs, are in fact more scary to me in some ways.. they are seen more often and the shadow effects are very scary. Still with the snare and feint even unstoppable monsters like the spawn can be dealt with pretty easily.

2x Sneak Attack / 1x Gandalf


 * Threat is not an issue in this quest.. if you get to 50 threat.. it is game over anyway. There simply isn't time for threat gain to be an issue. Still, one of the great problems in this quest is having being ready to win but not having the healing, and sneak attack Gandalf for +3 cards is super cool. You only need to dig in your deck near the end, so we can rely on Bilbo to draw our Gandalf by then we have the sneaks and a instant 6 cards.. right when we need them most. I'm currently adding 2 Radagast, 1 Gandalf, though 2 will increase the draw chance of this combo.. but in all honestly, I have rarely needed Gandalf for anything else. I feel that there is a good chance of him being in hand at the end of the game when you need to dig.

Minstrel, Steward + Songs.


 * Well, Steward of Gondor is, well.. it is Steward.. we want this cards as soon as possible. The 3xMinstrels allow us to get the song of kings out at a decent speed with out filling our deck with songs. They also quest for +2 .. witch is awesome. You want to place Kings on Legolas. There are few tactic cards, so he finds it hard to spend, until Winged Guardian gets out and then he starts spending a resource a turn almost, so his resource gain really slows. There are cards that key of attachments, so it is also important to get an attachment on all heroes. Then get Steward and Song of Lore on Elenore. Getting the song on Elenore allows you to cast the higher cost lore cards faster, and steward helps that as well, but also it allows you to often have spare spirit for test of will and Hasty stroke.

Basic Usage


 * I can not teach you in this post how to play the deck.. just try it out.. You want to NEVER quest with Elenore and use her ability to Cancel and speed up the encounter draw. Questing is mainly achieved though Legolas until mid game when your Minstrels and Rada is out. Save the Escorts for mid game to do super questing +4 for 2 mana.. early game you want Horse Breaker instead to give utility to your heroes. To kill Crows in one turn you need to attack with Legolas AND Wilyador. Wilyador can defend bats most times with no damage. Save Hasty Strokes for +1 dmg shadow cards to taped/wounded. Test of will you will want to cast a lot.. try and resist.. rule is if you can survive the card.. do not use it. When a card comes that will kill you, you want to have ready, like say +2 dmg to one questing character for example... Speaking of that.. play careful.. try to keep 1 resource on Spirit at all times for cancels and on tactics to keep your Guardian alive.

So yeah.. that is the main deck... here is the deck list as well as the scratch pad.

Tactics

3 Winged Guardian
2 Blade of Gondolin
2 Feint

Spirit

3 Escort from Edoras
1 Lorien Guide
3 Westfold Horse-Breaker
3 Ancient Mathom
1 Unexpected Courage
2 A Test of Will
2 Hasty Stroke
1 Stand and Fight

Leadership

2 Steward of Gondor
2 Sneak Attack

Lore

3 Daughter of the Nimrodel
2 Gleowine
1 Henamarth Riversong
2 Miner of the Iron Hills
3 Rivendell Minstrel
2 Forest Snare
2 Protector of Lorien
3 Lore of Imladris

Neutral

1 Gandalf
2 Radagast
1 Song of Kings
1 Song of Wisdom

Scratch Pad


Horseback Archer - To expensive, once winged guardian is out, he builds resources so slowly.
Erebor Hammersmith - The discard attachment shadow card is rare.. only 1 instant in entire deck.. this is over kill.. best to just hope you do not see it :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
Haldir of Lorien - To expensive
Longbeard Map-Maker - Hard choice.. still undecided... While his ability is crazy, I just never seamed to have the resources to exploit it.
Celebrian's Stone - This is very good, but 1 card only allowed.. drawing 1 card in 50 is so random, you want it early and just can not reply on that.. I feel it is best left to make room for something with more utility i can count on.
Dunedain Mark - undecided as well, 1 more attack dose allow Legolas to kill crows in one go alone.. that makes a big difference. This can be placed back in...
Valiant Sacrifice - Card draw is so important in this quest, if you do not get your Heals, you will not win. Still, I found that this deck dealt with everything so well, I nvr really go to use it.
Dwarven Tomb - again, only 1 copy of this card.. seams hard to bank on. Sure it is basically a "wild" card for anything in the yard.. but in my most of my games when running it IF i drew it.. it was nvr used. Still there are good arguments for this card.
Infighting - With the snares this is a great way to deal with Hummer Horns and other stuff. Simply snare Spawn or another high life creature and slowly load her with dmg, then you can instant kill creates coming off the encounter deck. In the long run though I felt that sneak attack and Gandalf was a better choice.
Lorien's Wealth - Card draw .. said it a few times already.. but yeah.. it makes or breaks this quest.. I decided to drop this for the sneak attack Gandalf thing die to that affectingly costing 2 less for the same effect as well as Gandalf having "other" uses.
Strength of Will - I tried hard to get this card to work.. and when it did it was awesome, still in most cases I nvr got to use it and it was a dead draw. The idea is that as Elenore is not tapped during questing, if there is no treachery to cancel you can tap her and cast this for 0 and add 2 tokens... all good in theory.. but the reality of the convergence of not having her tapped and traveling at THAT same time.. and having the card in hand seamed to be hard to pull off.

------ --- -- ----------- --- ------ --- -- ----------- --- ------ --- -- ----------- --- ------ --- -- ----------- --- ------ --- -- ----------- --- ------ --- -- ----------- --- ------ --- -- ----------- --- ------ 

So.. yeah.. this is my deck and the deck ideas... why do I think I need to go to drawing board? Well.. as I said the win ratio is pretty low.. I think I can do better.. one of the biggest problems is Legolas. While he allows me to deal with Bats and Crows (remember Wilyador can not even dmg crows) if there are no enemies getting pulled.. then it is game over, also if you are trying to stall the game to find the healing, then his ability and the blades will make him unable to attack anything, again.

I have been having a great time tying to build this deck and think this is a pretty decent attempt at this challenge. I am going to start again fresh with a completely new deck idea... I'll get back to you.

Pretty much like your deck, Tragic, although I would do some things different. I agree with you about Legolas, he's absolutely shining in this scenario. Eleanor seems like an obvious choice so I'm ok with including her, especially as this gives you access to the spirit resources. In my deck I replaced her with Denethor, who is not only able to deflect those treacheries, but also enemies that you don't like to meet with. But as much as I love Bilbo myself, I think this scenario calls for Glorfindel. He give you WP + attacking strength, he can take some undefended attacks and other damage stuff (DG Orcs) and he is able to heal that damage. Yes, this means a smaller cardpool, but if you'd add more Gandalfs you'd be able to get more cards in your hand (especially if you can play Ancient Mathom).

Playing a dual-sphere deck you could also set aside the leadership sphere, but add some Song of Travel to cover the spirit sphere. Lore should provide you with enough WP in the beginning, so you can wait for a while to grab a song to play those travel cards. Escort from Edoras is gold when it's late game and you want to finish 2B ASAP after you just got dealt the needed amount of Athelas. Haldir could be played in round 2 already, so that the DG Orcs should pose no threat.

Legolas' resources will be saved for neutral cards and, attached with SoT, for spirit cards, so I agree with your apporach  to add a bare minimum of tactics cards. You could even refrain from using Blade of Gondolin.

Hey Tragic, what about Bilbo, do you quest with him?
I ask this because he has only 2HP, and it is a little bit risky to do it with him.

 

I'm a player who likes to take this kind of risk, but want to know if this is a kind of a game-ender (does that term exists?) if he dies soon - aka turns 1-4.

 

Thanks.

I think you have to use Bilbo in the beginning to make at least some progress. Tragic's deck has Eleanor to eliminate most of the vital threats, but that's unfortunatly not a 100 percent guarantee, especially as she is helpless against the DG Orcs' effect which is why I think Glorfindel is better suited than Bilbo in this adventure.

I think way to go is Denethor (critical to this scenario in my opinion), Glorfindel, and Eowyn.  Initially, I used Eleanor instead of Eowyn because her treachery elimination sounds so appealing to this scenario, but in reality I never really had to use her much given I had Denethor and the spirit cards for eliminating treachery.  Eowyn's quest power is useful.  If you can get UC on Denethor he is very powerful in this quest.  I haven't had time to play 5 times, but have won the last 3 in a row with this combo.

Curious, I haven't heard anyone talk about using the 2B quest action to take 3 cards from encounter deck and add 1 to staging area.  There is a penalty of adding an encounter card to the staging area, but also a way to get access to a key Athleas card if you just can't draw one.  If you use Denethor ahead of time to scout out a card then you can know if there is at least 1 "safe" card and then this seems like a viable approach to take.

I use this occasionally. The main problem here is that you have to add one damage to Wilyador if you do so, that's why I use this action only if I have not enough Lore of Imladris and/or enough WP to handle another location. Otherwise this is also a nice way to grab an enemy to trigger Legolas' ability . I don't use Denethor before drawing these cards though, but afterwards.

He is the guy I am trying to work out if I can cut... as I said in the break down, if no monsters appear.. he is basically doing nothing for us.. and if you are trying to stall to dig out Athelas or Imladrishis ability can loose you the game for it will advance the quest when you do not want it to.

I agree, Denethor is defiantly the other option. I am currently looking at him this time around, though I find the protection from Elenore to be a bit safer. As her's is a "response" while Denathor's is "action".

This means that he can scry but only at action speed, so after you commit to a quest it is to late for him to scry again. There is no action window between the card reveals. What this means is that you can not scry and see a Athelas, go sweet, I'll keep that, then quest, reveal it, then untap and scry with Denathor again before you add the guarded card. While Eleneor can protect during this window. There are other examples as well. If you complete the traveled location of "Forest Grove" you have a may event to search the deck for a Athelas and add it to the staging area, this then gets a guarded card, but there is no action phase for you to scry between placing the Athelas and drawing the card. Opening yourself to death from treachery. Another miss use people use Denathor for is scrying shadow cards. You may scry b4 the first card is revealed but with Orcs, you are unable to do so before the 2nd card.. not really related to Elenore, but just thought I would mention it.

Yes, defiantly. Glorfindel is on my list for the new deck. I am not normally a fan of him due to his crazy start threat. You are looking at a 37-30ish start threat when running this guy. Still as you say he has some good tricks on him and in honestly I think that 1 point of heal is relevant during the final push.

leptokurt said:

Card is illegal. This challenge is meant to simulate the game state when aJTR came out. From reading many posts on here and BBG at the time, I think that was when the game lost many casual solo players. The rage of 17th Knight that prompted Boored to do this challenge is a pale reflection of the outrage that rippled across BGG. Still.. we are talking about 1 copy of Core + the APs up to aJTR.

When running Elenore you are free to save the Test of Wills for this alone... .. . Still you only need to quest for 4-6 at a time if you have teh stanging area under control. So by mid game you should not be questing with any heroes.

I do not think this is viable for solo play, the clock is super fast as it is, though this ability really useful in 2+ player games were you can run 6+ Imladris's (as everyone owns 1 core set). When you have 30 healing off Imladris alone in your deck the quest is a LOT easier!!

Surge is another good example of Eleanor's superiority to Denathor, as there is no action window b4 the surge card is revealed, so he can not stop somthing bad coming then, while Eleanor can.

Westfold Horse-Breaker isn't of much use with Eleanor. When a Treachery is revealed, you don't have an action opportunity. You can use Eleanor because her ability is a Response, not an action. However, if she's exhausted, you cannot use the Action from Westfold Horse-Breaker to ready her then use her Response to cancel the Treachery. Thus, unless you sacrifice the Westfold Horse-Breaker preemptively, it doesn't work.

Also, Legolas's ability is a Response, so it is optional. You can still kill enemies around the end of quest 2B. Just choose to NOT use the Response ability if you're not ready to move forward.

You know your right... and in fact Unexpected Courage is in the same boat, that is an action as well... this seams wrong.. have I been playing wrong all this time?

Yeah... respnses are alwasy optional
