Hi all, just a quickie.

 

Aragorn can add progress token if he attacks and destroys an enemy. Now.... Does this apply if I use mutiple attackers?

 

Say I use Aragon and Balin to attack and they destroy an enemy between them, would that trigger Aragorns ability?

 

All the best.

You mean Legolas?  Legolas can add progress to the current quest (or active location).  So can Gondolin Blade, which you could attach to Aragorn.. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

But no, it doesn't matter whether he attacks alone or with other characters-- if he participates in an attack that destroys an enemy, you can trigger that response and get those progress tokens.

Yep, that should have been Legolad. Thanks for the confirm. I had an idea it was right to do it, but it's always better to get a rule clarification if unsure.

All the best.
