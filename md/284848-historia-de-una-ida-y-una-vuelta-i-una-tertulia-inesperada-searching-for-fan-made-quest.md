I've been playing LotR: LCG for a long time and it's my #1 favorite game. Besides playing the official content i also love to play Fan Made Quests made by the community .

I used to have a ton of fan made content on my previous computer before it broke down. Now i'm searching for some old content to play.

I played many english quests already but would like to try some spannish ones in this site: http://susurrosdelbosqueviejo.blogspot.com/p/creaciones-propias_3818.html [http://susurrosdelbosqueviejo.blogspot.com/p/creaciones-propias_3818.html]

After playing the official Hobbit Saga (Over Hill and Under Hill + On the Doorstep) i would really love to try a fan-made version of Bilbo's story, sadly this 7-part saga seems to be broken on the 1st adventure. ( http://susurrosdelbosqueviejo.blogspot.com/2014/11/destellos-de-endor-hiv-i-una-tertulia.html [http://susurrosdelbosqueviejo.blogspot.com/2014/11/destellos-de-endor-hiv-i-una-tertulia.html] ). I managed to get all other adventures (2nd through 7th on the dropbox)

So i came here with a cry for help, has anyone previously played/downloaded this Saga? I'm looking for the 1st quest and the rules ( Reglas Historia de una Ida y una Vuelta ).

The creator of these (and other) quests is known as "Filgonfin" (David), but i don't know how to contact him, i sent a mail to this Sussuros Del Bosque site owner, but got a reply from "Mndela" but he doesn't know how to contact Filgonfin/David. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated. Finally, i'm much more confortable with english than spannish, so if anyone ever translated these adventures that would be a great boon too. 

Is there any hero out there who will lend their hand in assisting me in finding this quest? ?

Thank you very much in advance.

Still no help? ?

 

Me and a friend took a week of vacations and our main plan was to play as much of LotR LCG as we can. We already did many official adventures but want to do a bunch of fan-mades first. If possible quests that would use the Hobbit Saga encounters or would be in the same theme as Bilbo's journeys.

Who here plays fan-made LotR quests?

Heres the list of all Custom content (and respective makers) i found so far, if anyone knows more quests i can get please let me know:
