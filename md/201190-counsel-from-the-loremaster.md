FAQ has been updated. Horn of Gondor and Love of Tales have received errata, among other clarifications. I haven't read it all yet but I thought at least this much should be shared now.

Before digging into the nitty-gritty of the new FAQ (Horn of Gondor, whaaaaat), let's pour out a glass for Seastan's Love of Tales combo decks... All of the videos are great, but this one is a very clean demonstration of the idea:

> That's a seriously big change to Horn of Gondor.

 

Yup...My Rohan deck had Born Aloft and all the discard abilities (with Gamling recycling them) as well as chump blocking to generate quite a bit of resources.  And even though I didn't use Sneak Attack/Gandalf, it was used by other players so often that I could capitalize on it.  I still think I can make the deck work, but Horn of Gondor will just be put back on the shelf.

 

In reply to Sappidus, yes, I understand why they had to errata it as I've seen Seastan's video, but unfortunately there are plenty of decks that relied upon its old wording and will now be unusable.  So basically, it is still disappointing, even if necessary.

 

Edit: Oh I think I misread Sappidus a bit, but Horn of Gondor had to be errataed because of the 700 card deck with Emery spam and Horn of Gondor that Seastan created.  I guess this particular deck could have been dealt with a different way, but inevitably there would have been another card that surely could abuse the "leave play" wording on Horn of Gondor.

I was wondering why they errata'ed Horn of Gondor at all, then I remembered your Emery combo deck. SEASTAAANNNNNN!!! ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] (The sheer chutzpah of that deck design remains my single favorite break-the-game idea.)

Little bit disappointed Horn of Gondor doesn't trigger when an encounter card forces you to discard an ally, but aside from that they seem fine. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

And yes, Master of Lore de-nerf! Although that seems unlikely as they've probably already printed the nerfed card in the last run.

Just two days ago I was playing with a newer player, and he was so excited about his mono lore deck that relies on Master of Lore.  I couldn't bring myself to tell him about the errata, so we played with the original text.  He takes a few turns to set up and he's very fragile, but that Master of Lore was really fun to watch.  It encouraged you to hold back allies then flood the board, so I appreciate the decision-making it adds.  It was such a nice glimpse into what could have been (and may happen again some day).

Interesting about the Lasting Effects rule. I kind of always played it that way anyways. Not for any rules-justifiable reason, I think it seemed more natural. I saw such effects on player cards as one-shots, but on encounter cards as a passive ability.

 

And since I've never abused Love of Tales nor Horn of Gondor, and I have physical pre-errata copies (of course), I'm going to keep playing them the way they're written for me. The only "abuse" I've done with the Horn is my Aragorn/Gondor deck which relies on chump blocking with Squires and then reviving them with Spirit events.

You almost get two different meanings depending on where "until the end of the phase" appears. If it's at the start of the sentence it implies it should be recalculated, at the end it's an effect applied to the current state.

 

"Until the end of the phase, all characters get -1 Willpower" - lasting effect, recalculated when the state changes

"All characters get +1 attack until the end of the phase" - calculated for the current state.

I remember hearing that the philosophy behind player card errata was usually geared toward endless (or limitless anyway) combos, e.g. Will of the West.  I think on The Grey Company once they discussed the idea that there should be limits on certain cards like Horn of Gondor, or maybe I was hearing Dan talk or something.  This is good though, feels much more thematic as well.

 

This makes me want to play these cards more and more intentionally instead of throwing them in any old deck for resource generation.

 

Did anyone see the bit about resolving active location Response effects after completing the main quest and moving to a new main quest card?  I thought that was interesting.  I have always played it that the location was explored, resolved if it had an effect, then continue on with completing the quest and moving on.

Jokes aside, this nerf sucks. Not because I am using any deck with Horn of Gondor in it, but because it highlights the worst tendencies of FFG's card review and errata process. 

 

Horn of Gondor wasn't broken. It wasn't OP in 99% of decks. On average, it was solid-good. In a deck custom built to work with it, that maybe graduates to very strong. But nowhere near OP--I mean, this is a game where we have Steward of Gondor. 

 

Yes, it could be intentionally exploited to lead into OP territory but...why do the designers care? It takes a very specific deck design to accomplish that goal. It's not something a player could just accidentally stumble into in their deck-construction process and somehow not notice that suddenly the game's gotten a whole lot easier than it used to be. 

 

You have to want to exploit the card to OP levels to get those results--and if that's clearly your design philosophy then you are waving all responsibility on FFG's part to balance Quests based on your OP, crazy exploit deck. They simply do not have to care about your choice to break the balance of the game as you clearly know what you're getting into. 

 

That doesn't mean there's anything wrong with making crazy, broken decks--I've done it myself. It can be a stimulating challenge. It's fun! But nobody is expecting FFG to cater to my desire to clearly break the game's balance. 

 

Ultimately, this is a coop game. There is no competitive edge that needs to be balanced to make sure no one faction or combo has a significant advantage. FFG should balance for the average, the center, and let people play around at the margins as they please. The only reason we should be getting errata are literally game-breaking effects (ie: card A and card B literally conflict in the rules of the game or disrupt the structure of play).

everybody are concerned about the resources, horn and tales, but nobody says that finally can play the campaign mode to power changing themed heroes accompanying Frodo, without penalty.

I'm a fan of both erratas. I think you have to protect the integrity of the game, and allowing an effect to exist that can allow the encounter deck to be removed from the game or allow a player to play out their entire deck meets the definition of game-breaking in my opinion.

The errata is mainly for new players and reprints. It is a good idea. The reasoning for avoiding the errata is that this is a coop game so broken cards can be ignored. Well then why not just make all the cards broken? Anyway, by the same exact reasoning you can just ignore the official errata and play all the broken combo decks you want. Nothing is stopping you. You cacan play with fan made cards, etc. The official cards are still important for those who, like me, want to play within the confines of the official rules.

I think they missed on bringing errata to the wrong Gondor attachment. "O" cost attachments that give 2 free resources every successive turn and open any character in the game up to Gondor synergy is OP in every deck, not just ones successfully built to abuse it.

Alrighty, so encounter card 'lasting effects' are re-calculated as the game state changes, while player card effects are not.  This clears up some issues.

 

How about some older cards that say something like "each card currently in the staging area...?"  Should we now just apply that to all cards, regardless of whether or not they were currently in the staging area at the time that the treachery in question was revealed? It would seem that the intent is yes, and I'm fine with that.

Something that slipped in: no "guarding" for Guarded objectives that are "added" to the staging area rather than being "revealed."

 

Q: Does the Guarded keyword trigger when the encounter card it’s on is “added” to the staging area (and not “revealed”)? A: No. In order for the Guarded keyword to trigger, the encounter card it appears on must be “revealed” from the encounter deck.

Opinions are split on wether broken combos should be allowed to exist or be removed eh? No surprise there.

 

Love of Tales errata was needed and doesn't bother that many people I'd think. Horn of Gondor certainly shakes the core of this game! It makes thematic sense if nothing else (please don't errata Valiant Sacrifice as well for this reason and break my deck!).

I would say no, because in that case the "currently" eliminates any ambiguity.

It all depends on what your definition of "broken" is.  Love of Tales and Horn of Gondor are "broken" in a small number of decks, and not broken at all in a much larger number of decks.  The Love of Tales nerf makes Love of Tales about as useful as it ever was in a deck not designed to specifically exploit it.  The Horn of Gondor nerf makes Horn of Gondor *noticeably weaker* in plenty of decks not designed to specifically exploit it.

 

It's a fair argument that staple cards, of which Horn of Gondor arguably was one, make the game weaker by taking up deck space that could be filled by a wide variety of cards.  But I think a nerf that turns a "broken" (in a few decks) card into a coaster is a tragic event in the game.  Master of Lore can't be used to break the game any more, but it's hardly used at all.  Is that an improvement?

 

Eagles decks were just dealt a bitter blow.

Is this really true? Is it still possible to make an amusing Songs-LoT deck, or is the card COMPLETELY pointless now? The death of Seastan's shenanigans, wonderful as they were, might have distracted from the fact that the card pool might actually be at the point that nerfed LoT might actually be just barely playable. I'd work on this myself, but I'm currently still up against Carn Dum, and that doesn't seem like the right setting for jank experiments. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I don’t want to speak for either of you, but I feel like you are coming from a fairly similar place so I’ll reply to you together.

 

First of all, I can completely respect your opinion here. I actually agree, to an extent, that the designers should protect the integrity of the game up-to-and-including errataing previously released cards if they are inherently broken. I think where we disagree is how we define what a broken card is.

 

First, I think we can all agree that any card (player or encounter) that somehow creates a game-ending situation spontaneously or due to rules conflicts is, by definition, broken.

 

Beyond that, though, things get more fuzzy and subjective. Does a card being powerful make it broken? And if so, how powerful does it have to be to meet that criteria—remembering that cards like Glorfindel, Dain, Steward of Gondor, etc. do not meet that standard? And should we judge that card’s power by its intended use? Common use? Or uncommon but possible exploit use?

 

Let’s use Horn of Gondor as an example as the designers have clearly decided that this card, as written, was in some way destructive to the game’s balance or mechanisms and, so, in need of errata. The Horn’s intended use is pretty clear—it was designed to give decks that will lose allies often a way to recoup some of that loss. But is that how it’s commonly used? Well, yes and no.

 

It is definitely used for that reason in a lot of decks. But as the cardpool has expanded there has been more and more benefit to discarding and chumping characters (also some additional downsides including some chump-hate, which I would argue is a better way to balance this kind of thing, but we’ll ignore that for the moment) so in general I think it’s fair to say that the Horn has gotten more powerful over time and has become more commonly used. But is it now overpowered in common use? I would say no.

 

Certainly in a deck designed to take advantage of discarding and chumping characters it can represent a very real, decent economy boost. But that kind of deck needs that boost to be viable and competitive (vs the current difficulty of the Quests). And that deck-type is hardly without other mitigating factors, including a need for steady card draw. And in no common, general use deck is Horn ever the kind of consistent resource generation provided by—the again, not OP—Steward of Gondor.

 

So then we come to uncommon, or what I would prefer to call exploit use. Can a deck be purpose-built to exploit Horn of Gondor for everything it’s worth in order to essentially break the resource curve of the game? Yes, with the addition of certain other purpose-built combos.

 

But, and here is where we get into the fuzzy subjective side, does that make it broken? I think it depends.

 

If someone could conceivably drop this card into any number of decks and achieve that same game-changing resource acceleration then yes it would absolutely be broken. Why? Because that would mean that any number of common deck archetypes would have access to this and so the designers would have to account for that when balancing Quest difficulty. Which, in turn, would force players to play a narrower and more restrictive set of decks. Which would suck.

 

But in this example, and in most of the cards they choose to errata, this isn’t the case. Rather than a card simply being “too good” in common usage (whatever that entails, considering players—at least in part—have to be responsible for the cards they ultimately decide to play) cards are errataed because someone found a way to exploit them outside not only of their intended usage, but outside of their common and general usage as well. A process that almost always requires finely tuning a purpose-built deck to exploit the quirks of multiple cards and the game’s mechanics. And in that case—a case where someone has intentionally tried to break the game…why should we then use that as evidence that a given card, because of it’s potential to be exploited intentionally, is flawed or broken or over-powered?

 

Like I said in my earlier post, there is absolutely nothing wrong with thinking up or designing some crazy exploit deck designed to break the game. I just do not understand why FFG treats the intentional decision to custom-build something like that as something they need to address—either via errata of the constituent components of said exploits or through rebalancing of Quest difficulty. Not unless there is evidence that people are stumbling upon those game-breaking combo decks by accident as part of the organic deck-building process and not understanding why the game suddenly got so much easier.

 

For the record—I want to play inside the rules of the game to, I just don’t want those rules changed because someone else is choosing to break the game for their own enjoyment, with no negative consequences to anyone else. I’m not saying that truly broken cards should just be left alone because, as I stated above, that can have bad consequences. But I think FFG needs to have a much more rigorous standard to what they consider a broken card. Especially in a games that is—yes—coop.

Whaaaat. That's crazy, I've been doing that wrong for years.

 

On the Horn of Gondor thing - balance-wise I think a better solution would've been to give it a "limit once per phase", but I'm somewhat inclined to think that this choice of errata is more motivated by the intent of what the card is supposed to be doing than game balance (though it may have been initially motivated by the existence of a broken combo deck).

So, on the Guarded ruling, does that mean that all keyword effects (like doom and surge) should also be considered "When Revealed" effects? Because that's not the way I've been playing since...ever. 

 

As for the game balance vs intent argument...you may be right. But if so that sucks--especially for Love of Tales.

 

It's like they're trying to limit cards from growing into more than they were originally intended but without any reason. Outside of weird, broken combo decks those cards were better than they were originally but they weren't crazy. They had just finally grown into themselves.

The rulebook defines both Surge and Doomed as when revealed effects.  So those have never triggered when added to the staging area.  Guarded (in the rule book) triggers when it enters the staging area.

>

> > Eagles decks were just dealt a bitter blow.
> 
> How many eagles were you discarding a turn anyway?  I don't think it will be that be an effect.

There's some spread between discarding multiple eagles per turn and having no effect.  Horn of Gondor was cost-effective in an Eagles deck, because the Vassals go away when used (barring battle questing), the Winged Guardians go away if you don't pay, and Eagles of the Misty Mountains likes other Eagles to go away.  Over the course of a game that's likely less than one resource per turn, though it's augmented by other allies leaving play.  Not at all broken, but certainly useful, especially since Eagles are expensive.  If you're running the full Eagles, Landroval, Thorondor's Descendant and Gwaihir have abilities involving something leaving play, and Meneldor's Flight specifically calls an Eagle out of play.

 

Now Eagles are too limited and expensive to use all this discarding to break the game by generating massive amount of resources.  It was just a nice bonus that made an Eagles deck work better, either by providing a few extra resources for expensive Eagles or a non-tactics splash heroes.  Totally non-broken, and fully expected when Eagles were introduced and the Horn of Gondor was one of a limited number of tactics cards in the pool.  But now, Eagles only trigger Horn of Gondor when one is destroyed, and not a single Eagle is designed to be a chump blocker.

 

The funny thing is that Tactics really *shouldn't* be the chump blocker sphere in the first place.  There's only two 1-cost allies, one is Outlands, so chumping goes against its trait strategy, and the other is a one-shot attacker.  Leadership has three one-cost allies, one of which is specifically designed to chump block and another has only an enter-plays ability.  An army of disposable allies is really Leadership's thing, not Tactics.  Eagles were the one tactics synergy with Horn of Gondor, and now that's gone.

I've used the Eagles with the horn and I agree you might be losing a couple of resources over the course of the game, but not more than that. Certainly not a resource per turn.

Anyway, I am now wondering if this change wasn't made because of a coming card.

My disappointment is that the lasting effects clarification reverses an unofficial ruling from Caleb. I was hoping to make thematic non-combat deck for A Shadow of the Past (still needs a bit more support), and Out of Sight ("Enemies engaged with you cannot attack you this phase.") is a key card in that deck because it can be played in the hide test action window, before all the Black Riders engage you. In response to a question I sent, Caleb said: "Any enemy that ends up engaged with you that phase will not attack, regardless of whether or not it was engaged with you at the time you played it." (Then I would return them to the staging area with Spirit Pippin to avoid attacks in the combat phase or, if I had enough willpower, race to finish the quest while avoiding combat with Hobbit-sense; I didn't say it was a good deck.) I'm handicapping myself enough for this quest that I think I might stick with Caleb's unofficial ruling.

The Beravor's Path [https://youtu.be/IOa8guKrqQU] deck is also pretty ridiculous and wasn't impacted by the errata. But, nothing on the level that could be done with Love of Tales or Horn of Gondor.

Quite the contrary. The whole point was to draw your deck for Songs; stack Steward, Gondorian Fire, and Blood of Numenor with Fast Hitches; quest through each phase, tank a hit, and drive his enemies before him.

I love the erratas of the player cards !

 

Horn Of Gondor was too strong in 4 players a was broken with a lot of decks.

The new version is much more thematic, and still pretty strong in a 4 players game.  :wub: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wub.png]

 

 

The problem is that this errata weakens Rohan decks. I loved playing Horn on Eomer for a lot of generation resources with the Rohan Mecanic.

 

I think this errata will lead to new cards and especially to a new Leadership Mount.

For instance, something like that will be awesome :

 

Rohirrim Steed

Leadership

1 cost Attachment:

Mount Rohan

Attach to a Hero. Restricted.

After a Rohan character is discarded by a player card effect, add one resource to attached Hero resource pool. (limit once per phase)

Horn of Gondor:

I wished they make it not restricted but good catch to the theme .. some decks with high character-frequency like rohan, eagle or silvan now needs a new ressource generation.

For rohan spirit Theoden && Gamling ally (does his response trigger by destroyed rohan allies?) do a great job of ally recycling and cost reduction.

For silvans .. there are many benefits for leaving/entering play, OLorien gives cost reduction so there is no need for an extra resource benefit via HOG.

For eagles .. bad .. very bad. Old Radagst is the only help for them.. he must get errated! And some keycards for the eagles are needed.

Hm. I went looking for a ruling on that a while ago and couldn't find one. I had initially assumed it'd be like Doomed and Surge but then as I recall in the Progression Series Mitch and Matthew revealed guards for Athelas brought in via Forest Grove, and since I couldn't find anything to support my version, I assumed they must have it right and played it that way ever since. The fact this didn't go in the FAQ sooner seems like a pretty big oversight.

One of my partners doesn't like the Horn of Gondor change and wants to use the old version. As a compromise I have suggested

 

Response: After a character is destroyed, add 1 resource to attached hero's pool

Response: After a character is discarded without being destroyed, exhaust Horn of Gondor to add 1 resource to attached hero's pool.

 

What do people think about that?

 

Another possibility might be

 

Response: After a character is discarded by an encounter card effect or is destroyed, add 1 resource to attached hero's pool.

 

 

I share her concern that a card that is good without being OP in most cases is being nerfed to deal with OP decks and strategies that we will never use.

I totally get where you're coming from and don't think it's an unreasonable position. The lines are fuzzy when it comes to what is considered "broken", which is why such things become controversial in the first place. I don't think a card that is just really, really powerful should receive errata. This is why I didn't support a Dain errata when there was talk of such things at the height of Dwarf decks, for example. This is because such cards may make the game really, really easy, but they don't "break the game" in the sense of making the actual game a moot point. When you can remove the entire encounter deck using Love of Tales (in combination with other cards), the game ceases to be a game and just becomes an exercise. Same with Horn of Gondor and playing out your entire deck.

 

As to your point that errata should not address cases where exploits are sought out and found, I think that is where our core disagreement lies. I think those are actually the primary cases where errata should be issued. I personally don't like the philosophy of "don't play it if you don't want to exploit it". Just knowing that the game can be exploited lessens its standing as a game in my eyes. That's what I mean by damaging its integrity. A game system that can be undermined in that way loses its credibility as a cohesive set of rules. I also think it's just natural to how these kinds of card games develop. There are too many cards and interactions for designers of any expandable card game to avoid any exploits. This is true of competitive games just as much. And errata allows for fixing this.

 

The issue seems to be that you are concerned that the errata punishes "regular" players because some players go off and find the exploits. Again, I can see the concern. Does the errata make Horn of Gondor less powerful? Undoubtedly. But I think as a couple of others have pointed out in this thread, I like the errata to Horn of Gondor because it not only addresses the exploit, but does so in a way that also enhances the theme of the card and opens up further design space in the future. The Horn, Boromir's Horn, should be keying off of the sacrifice of characters, not just them leaving play. And now there can be a card in the future that does provide resources for characters leaving. I don't see the impact for most players in regards to Love of Tales. Pretty much it was either being used in super exploit decks or not at all. For those who want to explore it as a way to facilitate song decks, I don't think it loses a ton of value in that regard, and allows for more songs to come out in the future without worrying about breaking the game.

 

Again, I don't think my perspective is necessarily the only valid one, and I suspect that this disagreement will always exist because it reflects different ways of approaching the game or thinking about the game. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing.

I hate when they nerf stuff, they can just make it so much worse. Why not give Horn of Gondor response: after a character is destroyed, exhaust Horn of Gondor to add 2 resources to…" That way it is still inferior to Steward but you only need one chump a round to make it worth it.

I think Love of Tales errata is good.

I then wonder to see Faramir in the same article as an example, not an errata. In my opinion such cards need it more, though I see it is not part of loops.

Lol--maybe but Nori was way less powerful (even with Bofur and Sneak Attack) and they errataed him. 

 

I do agree with you, though. It seems like if they haven't made a change to Steward yet, they won't. I guess they want Steward to be powerful while having problems with Horn growing in power? But I guess Steward hasn't grown in power (unless we concede that there are just more good cards to use the resources on) so much as it has always been godly.

But Radagast and the Eagels won't get errataed because we simply do not get positive errata (except maybe Thalin, but that was more of a clarification to how he works). I think in FFG's eyes it would hurt sales of newer, more powerful cards to go back and help old ones be more viable in the current cardpool (pure supposition on my part, of course, but it makes sense...). 

 

And as for the need to errata either Horn or Love of Tales...I just don't see it but we can agree to disagree. I think that you may be undervaluing the need for resource generation in high-discard decks though. Especially Rohan. So people will fall back to using Steward...again (unless a partner deck needs it more). Or they'll just have to scrap the deck-type for use in the harder modern quests until better cards come out. There just isn't another viable option for some decks...

I don't like House Ruling cards personally because I feel like the designers are counting on the errata when they balance the quests.

 

That being said I have disagreed with basically all of the nerfs on the various player cards--pretty much all of them having been made to combat quirky exploit decks I don't run. 

 

I'm kind of getting to the point where I'm considering just ignoring the erratas all together but...that feels like cheating...

 

I don't know.

> The issue seems to be that you are concerned that the errata punishes "regular" players because some players go off and find the exploits. Again, I can see the concern. Does the errata make Horn of Gondor less powerful? Undoubtedly. But I think as a couple of others have pointed out in this thread, I like the errata to Horn of Gondor because it not only addresses the exploit, but does so in a way that also enhances the theme of the card and opens up further design space in the future. The Horn, Boromir's Horn, should be keying off of the sacrifice of characters, not just them leaving play. And now there can be a card in the future that does provide resources for characters leaving.

I'll grant the thematic improvement.  I'm a little dubious on opening the design space -- after nerfing Horn of Gondor for characters leaving play, I can't imagine they'll recreate it elsewhere, even with a limit.  It's true that it opens up the design space for subsets of leaving play (e.g. resources for discarding from play), but that space was already there, outside of Tactics -- and never would've been in tactics in the first place, for thematic reasons.

 

But if Horn of Gondor errata was prompted by the thematic disconnect of rewards for destruction instead of leaving play, it would've been done long, long, before now.  Eagles decks had synergy with Horn of Gondor in the very first cycle, and I can't imagine that offended the designers' sensibilities then.  Why now?  Valiant Sacrifice and Grave Cairn have the same thematic disconnect and didn't get errata.  I think it's clearly not the theme that's driving this, but rather the power.  And the power could have been addressed by a limit without changing the way the card works.

 

Why does this matter?  It's a popular card, it's included in all manner of decks available online, including those promoted for new players or even sample decklists provided by FFG.  And suddenly its inclusion may no longer make sense in those decks -- unless it is multiplayer or employs chump blocking, it probably doesn't.  In a survey of 100 decks at cardgamedb, I found Horn of Gondor in 22 of 50 possible decks (tactics access).  Some of those may no longer make sense.  This wouldn't have happened if a limit was imposed instead of fundamentally changing its function.

 

At least the errata didn't completely coaster it.  The same survey showed Master of Lore in just one of 42 possible decks (Lore access, HoN or later cycles used).  Thror's Map was in just one of 41 possible decks (Lore access, OHUH or later saga used).  In my mind, an underpowered card is a greater tragedy than an overpowered one, and certainly when an errata is deemed necessary I think extra effort should be made to make sure the card is still interesting and usable for its cost.

 

(Love of Tales was in zero of 49 possible decks, showing it's possible for a card to be both abusive *and* still a coaster.)

I don't really care for the LoT errata either because it was already a coaster card for me.  I've constantly wanted to make a few decks that utilize it as a means of lore resource generation, but I just find - without trying to make a solo exploit deck - that it's unlikely to be worth the effort.  Horn is an interesting change, but it is sad to see how much it effects the Rohan trait.  I would have preferred if it was just limited to 3 times per round or once per phase, or even just characters you control to temper it in multiplayer decks.

Totally agree with dalestephenson about the Horn. They make it sound like it was the theme but indeed it is always just the loop. And as for the theme, I really think it should be exhaust to do something, and that something shouldn't be little, because it was such a thing when that happened in the books, but it only happened a few times (you're not gonna be playing the horn for a symphony).

Rohan discard effects such as Ride to Ruin, Helm! Helm!, Háma and even Escort from Edoras are extremely thematic alongside Horn of Gondor, and now they don't work together. So yeah, theme was most definately not the main reason for the errata, IMO.

I never said the Horn change was prompted by theme considerations. I said it was nice that it fits the theme while addressing the loop.

 

The designers as well never said this either. Here's the exact words from the article: 

"As for the other two errata included in this updated FAQ, both Horn of Gondor and Love of Tales were deemed too powerful in their current form because of the potential for abuse."

 

Seems pretty up front to me.

One question:

 

One time Horn of Gondor is faqqed, Master of Lore's faq makes sense?

Remember the old faq to avoid the first famous broken combo: Hammersmith, Born Aloft, Horn of Gondor and Master of Lore. The faq fell on Master of Lore, the combo then was dead.

 

Question now is: if Horn of Gondor changes, could Master of Lore return to original version? Interesting....!

 

PD: i know developers won't do it, but now Maste of Lore faq doesnt make sense, or... you know any other way to broke the game with MoL?

Of course it doesn't I remember thinking then they took the weakest card in the combo (on par with Borne Aloft perhaps) and nerfed it.

Well then why not just make all the cards broken? Anyway, by the same exact reasoning you can just ignore the official errata and play all the broken combo decks you want. Nothing is stopping you. You cacan play with fan made cards, etc. The official cards are still important for those who, like me, want to play within the confines of the official rules.

> I totally get where you're coming from and don't think it's an unreasonable position. The lines are fuzzy when it comes to what is considered "broken", which is why such things become controversial in the first place. I don't think a card that is just really, really powerful should receive errata. This is why I didn't support a Dain errata when there was talk of such things at the height of Dwarf decks, for example. This is because such cards may make the game really, really easy, but they don't "break the game" in the sense of making the actual game a moot point. When you can remove the entire encounter deck using Love of Tales (in combination with other cards), the game ceases to be a game and just becomes an exercise. Same with Horn of Gondor and playing out your entire deck.

> As to your point that errata should not address cases where exploits are sought out and found, I think that is where our core disagreement lies. I think those are actually the primary cases where errata should be issued. I personally don't like the philosophy of "don't play it if you don't want to exploit it". Just knowing that the game can be exploited lessens its standing as a game in my eyes. That's what I mean by damaging its integrity. A game system that can be undermined in that way loses its credibility as a cohesive set of rules. I also think it's just natural to how these kinds of card games develop. There are too many cards and interactions for designers of any expandable card game to avoid any exploits. This is true of competitive games just as much. And errata allows for fixing this.

And now there can be a card in the future that does provide resources for characters leaving. I don't see the impact for most players in regards to Love of Tales. Pretty much it was either being used in super exploit decks or not at all. For those who want to explore it as a way to facilitate song decks, I don't think it loses a ton of value in that regard, and allows for more songs to come out in the future without worrying about breaking the game.

That's fair and I can totally understand that view even if I don't agree with it. I think a lot of us are just going to have to agree to disagree here since there really isn't a "correct" answer. 

 

I do want to say this though since it's something that gets brought up a lot in relation to errata. While I do absolutely prescribe to the "if you don't like it, don't play it" philosophy, conflating that philosophy with the majority of player card erratas seems a little off-base to me. 

 

Something like Dain or Steward or Sneak Attack+Gandalf or Glorfindel fits neatly into that "don't like, don't play" argument (very powerful cards/combos that can be easily used in any number of decks and that many feel are too powerful). But most of the erratas don't follow that pattern. As discussed, they are usually born from the intentional exploitation of the rules by certain players. And while I am fine with people doing either (since I will never have to compete against anyone with an unfair advantage in this game) I see them as clearly different things. 

 

To use a video game analogy for a moment: it's the difference between playing a coop or single player game on Easy vs playing it with a mod to fundamentally change the game's rules or systems (turn off damage or infinite money or whatever). 

 

I do kind of wonder if opinion on this issue is split by gaming tastes and history. I'm primarily a board gamer that plays this game as a coop game--not as a CCG. From that background errata is something you do only when you messed up and there is a conflict or a significant imbalance that needs to be fixed. But for CCG players I know that errata is a much more accepted part of life since in a competitive setting the designers simply have to make frequent changes to address the meta...

 

 

> I hate when they nerf stuff, they can just make it so much worse. Why not give Horn of Gondor response: after a character is destroyed, exhaust Horn of Gondor to add 2 resources to…" That way it is still inferior to Steward but you only need one chump a round to make it worth it.
> 
> I think Love of Tales errata is good.
> 
> I then wonder to see Faramir in the same article as an example, not an errata. In my opinion such cards need it more, though I see it is not part of loops.

 

For better or worse the designers seem less concerned with a card's overall power than they are with it being used for its intended purpose, within its intended limitations and without facilitating any exploit combos.

Agree with most of this.

 

Master of Lore isn't terrible but it takes so long to make back your cost that it just isn't worth it. At least Leaf Brooch pays for itself after the first use. 

 

Thror's Map can still be really good but it's pretty quest specific. And it's Spirit so in a lot of cases it's easier just to snipe the location via other means.

Theme-wise it should be an exhaust ability. Something like: Attach to a Gondor hero. Action: Exhaust Horn of Gondor to do "something awesome". If attached to Boromir, do "something awesomer". 

 

But the card has never really been big on theme. Nor was it errataed because of it's thematic inconsistency. But it does at least evoke the theme a little more now (by coincidence). That's something...I guess.

Oh, how I wish that were true. And I think it would have been, had it been released a little later (cycle 3 onward). The design team has improved with player cards a lot, I think. Some of the core-set choices were (understandably, I guess) very poor.

 

And we can still hope for a new version of Horn of Gondor but I do not think that is very probable. They are still to make two versions of a non-character card, right? One thing they can hardly improve, I feel, would be the art on Horn of Gondor.

Thror's Map is Lore...

 

I feel like the whole theme thing may be coming partly from my comment back on page 3 about the errata being motivated by the original intent of the card, so I think I should clarify it (and remember this is merely my assumption not backed up by anything concrete) - I think the reason Horn of Gondor has been errata'd at all is because of its power level and its presence in some overpowered combos. I think the reason Horn of Gondor has been errata'd this specific way is because of the theme and the original intent of the card.

Could the original version reduce to 0 cost, or was it always minimum 1?  I would love for him to be minimum 1, but applied to all cards of a type instead of just one.

Okay.

 

So, I still hate the errata (really almost all errata) for all the reasons I’ve listed before. Chief among them my concern that it reduces the number of modern-quest viable, non-OP decks.

 

But you know what? I’ve been sold on it. I hate it. But I’ve been sold that the errata (and probably some more besides—looking at you Elrond+Vilya) are necessary from FFG’s perspective. Because I completely forgot about one of the worst, most needless and most underused aspects of this game (all my opinion, obviously)—the tournament format.

 

This game, technically has an official competitive format. Games are scored (on a frankly janky formula that skews towards certain types of decks over others) and players ranked in an official, FFG-sanctioned way that does not take into account deck archetype. And within that system it is completely necessary to treat this game like any other competitive LCG (because it is by that standard) and actively re-balance cards and combos that can be exploited (whether they are exploited by the majority of players or not).

 

And that sucks because people like me who want to play within the rules and framework of the game are having those rules and systems altered to accommodate a system that, frankly, is used by probably less than 10% of players (and I am being generous with that estimate). And the solution really could have been as simple as a Tournament-Scoring specific blacklist (or even Tournament-Scoring specific errata).

 

All of that being said though, as long as FFG continues to say that this is a game that you can and should play competitively rather than just offering it as an unsupported variant I do understand why FFG has to make these changes.

 

Guess now I just have to decide if the realization that FFG sees the game as something fundamentally different than the one I’m playing is enough of a push for me to not feel like I’m cheating by just ignoring all of the errata going forward…

Pretty sure they'd still do errata without the tournament format (is that the scoring stuff in the rulebook or the Against the Shadow one btw?). I've never gotten the impression they promoted that very heavily or really expected everyone to use it. I think I remember someone (either Matt / Caleb or maybe Nate French?) saying that the only reason it's there was to allow players used to competitive games a way of comparing themselves against each other.

 

Anyway, at least Horn of Gondor still triggers if you force Hero Treebeard to commit suicide. So there's that.

Success% should be the ultimate way to measure decks' strength. Honestly the score system promotes unsafe, risky plays just for the sake of scoring low, and that is not indicative of a well-played game imo

Maybe.

 

But honestly the fact that there is that officially supported competitive variant is the only reasonable explanation I've heard for why FFG should care (as they clearly do) about balancing against abusive and exploitable cards and combos that aren't in general use outside of those that intentionally choose to build exploit decks to break the game's core balancing. 

 

In the closed-system of a coop experience (ala any of FFG's coop board games) errata is used primarily to address misprints, oversights and--in extreme circumstances--game breaking and/or severely unbalancing factors that didn't appear during playtesting. But that's not how FFG erratas this game; they errata it for relative balance and to shut down potential exploit decks--just like they errata their other competitive LCGs. And the only conceivable reason to do that in a coop game is because they are assuming people are using the Scoring System they've put in place. 

 

As for why they added the scoring system at all, my understanding was that it was primarily a Sales and Marketing strategy. When they released the game they assumed a very similar audience (and similar audience behavior) to their other core LCGs. But in practice they found that while the game sold well people weren't playing it in large numbers at Cons or FLGSs (probably because pickup games of this are hard). That led them to change the scoring system to the current, official "Tournament Format" scoring to try and encourage more play by those competitive player that FFG saw as their bread and butter (and as a huge potential revenue bump in they could entice them to play, advertise and evangelize the game in local stores).

Agree that the current system is messy. 

 

But I would actually say that if you are trying to compare player vs player the most important variable is Deck Archetype. 

 

Beating a given, hard Quest with Gandalf-Outlands ia a very different accomplishment than beating the same hard Quest with Mono-Tactics Eagles or Rohan.

I think it is quite right and proper that they issue errata to break ridiculous combos that for instance get huge numbers of resources. I just think they should try as much as possible to make these errata hit only these combos. (Edit: Obviously "only" is asking too much, but what I mean is that these errata should not greatly impact normal players very much)

 

Horn of Gondor doesn't even trigger off Tactics Boromir's sacrifice action any more. Sadface.

^ Exactly. Make the errata by any means, but not by making the card nigh useless, which for such an iconic artifact, Horn of Gondor, is a great shame.

I support this only in case of ties. Success% still comes first regardless of deck used

 

Also, saying which deck archetype is better is very subjective, and this is one of the reasons I created the other topic 'Log your quest' because I deeply believe in hard data rather than oppinions (no offense intended btw)

this has been a fascinating read (cards and strategy I am clueless about as well as those video links), but i must ask....

 

what is "nerfing" a card.

nerfing means "fixing" something but making it worse actually than before

thanks!  I play paper and counter wargames, while I did not know the term, I do know about issuing errata for things and making them worse

Sorry if this has been asked elsewhere, what software is Seastan using for playing the game?

 

Thanks!

Is is online or stand alone.  Watching one of his videos, it seems the card database is online as he "downloaded" the decks before he played.

 

I like playing with physical components, but it would be nice to play around while watching TV and the like.

Look here: http://octgngames.com/lotrlcg/installation/ [http://octgngames.com/lotrlcg/installation/]

 

The website he uses in videos is the Rivendell Councilroom: http://ddddirk.github.io/lotrdb/ [http://ddddirk.github.io/lotrdb/]

You don't have to use it, OCTGN has its own deck builder built in, but a lot of people prefer to deckbuild on the Councilroom and then download the decks in OCTGN format once they're done.
