When an encounter card says to reveal the top most enemy in the encounter or encounter discard pile and have it engage a player, does surge trigger? I played that it did because it was revealed. Did I play it correctly? I know that when you add enemies keywords like surge do not, but wasn't sure on this one.

If it uses the word "reveal" then the surge effect triggers. If it puts the enemy into play, but does not use the word reveal, then the surge does not trigger.
