# [Things That Could&#039;ve Been Better](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/307005-things-that-couldve-been-better/)

## 1 [John Constantine on March 19, 2020](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/307005-things-that-couldve-been-better/?do=findComment&comment=3916535)

I don't know why I am doing this, but those thoughts have been floating around my head for quite awhile, and I think it is a good time that I gave them some release. Please note that I am not doing it out of any kind of malign purpose, I have invested a lot of my time, money, and thoughts into this game across the many years, and despite that I've moved on to Arkhame LCG, and despite all the flaws of the LotR LCG, I still love it and wish it best. That being said, I want to list for discussion some things I think were handled badly with this game's design, starting with...

 

1. One Active Location

The concept of only having one active location at a time regardless of the number of players is atrocious and leads to one of the game's biggest gameplay problems - location pollution in the staging area. Like a snowball, it keeps growing and there is little to be done about it, unless players have specifically prepared for it. Yes, there are ways to deal with this (Tracker), but when game forces players into a specific play pattern otherwise they're not gonna win - it's not a good design. Game should give options to play it, not eliminate them. Each player should have their own active location, and each location that has on travel or while active effects should affect only the player who has that location as active one.

 

2. Doomed

This is very similar to the next point, but since it is also printed on player cards, I made it a separate one. Doomed shouldn't threat all the players by default, period. I will go deeper into the problem with this in my next point, but while addressing player doomed effects, I will say that if a card taxes every player in the game with threat, its effect should scale for every player, otherwise the net cost increases with each additional player, while gains from playing it remain static. When every player pays 2 threat for 2 cards because of Deep Knowledge - it makes sense; when each players pays 1 threat for 1 resource discount that Grima gives only to his owner - it doesn't. And there is nothing to be done about it, because Doomed is a badly designed keyword, and only ways to go around it would be to either drop the keyword entirely and increase threat by text/invent a new similar but different keyword, or use very elaborate card effects that prevent other players from paying unnecessary threat. Doom should've been designed to only affect the player who draws the encounter card/plays the player card with it, and in rare cases when Doom should actually affect each player, it could've been resolved by having a text like "Each player triggers Doom 2", or simply having a keyword modifier "Doom All 2".

 

3. Encounter Card Design

Sharing the main sentiment with the previous point, this point is simple: there are just too many encounter cards that affect the entire party and not just the player who drew them. I even checked recent quests, and this problem haven't gone anywhere, it became worse if anything. For example, there is a treachery that makes each player either discard their hand or assign damage equal to the cards in hand among their characters. And thats just one card. It's a huge hit to everyone's health/hand in a multplayer game, and then each other player has to draw a card as well, which might turn out to be similar or the same card, hitting the entire party again. And they wonder why Test of Will so powerful. Because your treacheries are out of hand. Your cards are out of hand. The encounter deck already scales with each additional player by having each player draw an encounter card during the quest phase, you don't need to scale so many blasted inidivual encounter effects as well, making each encounter card draw grow stronger with the number of players. Arkhame Horror LCG took a very good note of this.

 

4. Enemy Design

Most enemies are too bulky and too powerful to be fun to play against. Seriously, why even have such things as defense and health for allies and most heroes, if they all are gonna die from just 1 hit from an average enemy in this game? You need a dedicated defender akin to Beregond to even stand a chance of surviving a single attack, most expensive (more than 1 turn worth of resources) allies can easily die from 1 attack, and when they don't from raw stats - shadow effects are there to make sure they do. Don't get me wrong, shadow effects is an awesome game mechanic, I'm not here to knock on it (I have absolutely nothing bad to say about it), but with enemies already so powerful right off the bat and most player entities being so helpless to survive even a single attack... it's just an overkill. And then there is defense. If you somehow managed to keep enough characters ready to the point when you are able to retaliate, most of the enemies have insanely high defense to the point a single attack dedicated character is not going to scratch them, so you can't even go through the long route of gradually killing an enemy across multiple turns most of the time, you must muster enough attack to take their gargantuan defense+health pools in one swing or you're stuck with them. Did I mention you need to dispatch characters to quest (during which enemies also hinder you via their threat) and defend before you get to this point? 

 

5. Bad Starting Conditions

Oh boy, how many games are technically lost due to bad opening encounter draws. And if opening encounter draws weren't bad enough, you only start out wth 3 resources, with which you can't buy jackshit, but with which you are somehow expected to efficianly quest, attack and defend right off the bat. Players should either have more starting resources, or there shouldn't be so much encounter cards ahead of the first quest phase, unless absolutely necessary. Depending on a mild starting encounter draw to have at least the chance to play the game is not a very good design.

 

6. Insane difficulty on normal

For a game that prints so much bad/mediocre but thematic cards, this game sure does kick you in the balls a lot for trying to play with them. Balancing the quests around the top, most overpowered player cards sure makes it not very fun to play for people who are not trying to minmax. Sure, there are some mildly difficult quests, but they are in minority (at least the ones I am acquainted with, do rememeber that I do not pose as some omnipotent being, this is all my subjective opinion), and you shouldn't be gated out of the larger quest mass just because you're not a min-maxing meta abuser type . And then there is nightmare. It feels like difficulty-wise most of the quest in their current state should've been nightmare.

It's true that having one active location, doomed, and each player treacheries scale against larger number of players.  Meanwhile, fixed starting setups, progress needed on locations and quests, and combat scale against smaller number of players.  Across the entirety of all quests, I'd guess that specialized fellowships are more effective than solo one-deck play, though I'm not sure that'd be true of pickup or non-coordinated multiplayer.  Certainly "fixing" design points that exclusively scale against higher player counts would heavily tilt the difficulty in favor of higher player count.

Enemies have gotten heftier over the course of the game, but defensive options have also multiplyied over the course of the game.  I agree that on most allies points in defense are wasted, even 3/3 defenders need attachments to be reliable defenders.  But compared to the core set where chumping was pretty much required in most decks, there's a lot more tools to use.  Attack is also cheaper to field than it was when the game started (due to its overpriced allies).

Starting with random encounter draws has, I think, decreased over the course of the game:

core+Mirkwood: 5/9 quests

KD/Dwarrowdelf: 7/9 quests

Hobbit saga: 4/6 quests

HoN/AtS: 2/9 quests

VoI/Ringmaker: 1/9 quests

LR/Angmar: 2/9 quests

GH/Dreamchaser: 1/9 quests

SoH/Haradrim: 1/9 quests

LOTR saga: 5/20 (counting PoD quests)

WoR/EM: 1/9 quests

It's become more of a rarity, though IMO the nastiness of the reveals has also become more even as the game progressed.  You could argue giving the chance of an easy reveal in earlier cycles is better than starting you with a known brutal setup.  (Note -- the above are straight reveal quests -- some quests have variable add-to-staging of a particular type which can introduce significant randomness, while others have choose-your-own elements.)

The designers *did* address the difficulty of the normal startup by adding "easy mode".  In easy mode, or even just using the extra resources while leaving all cards in the deck, I think a "large quest mass" is very beatable by an experienced player with a thematic deck.

The *bad* thematic cards are heavily concentrated in the early cycles.  In the current and previous cycle, there've also been a lot of cards which make old bad cards better.

I am inclined to agree about Doomed player cards, though the recent Saruman hero may breathe life into some of them.  

As to the general complaint of some game features scaling up better or worse with the number of players, I  actually enjoy that aspect of the game.  I am quite lucky in that I have two different groups I am currently enjoying the game with, and I also enjoy the game 1-Handed solo.  So I get to play the game 1-Decked, 3-Decked, and 4-Decked, and I find that because of the non-linear way in which some elements scale (or fail to scale) with the number of players, it can make quests feel very different and distinctive depending on the number of players.   For instance, tackling Conflict at the Carrock solo means that there are 4 unique trolls for the player to deal with (versus in 4-Player where there's only one troll for each player), but at the same time in single-handed you may never even reveal a Sacked! card during staging.  When you stage 3 or 4 cards every round, you're very likely to see most of the encounter deck at least once and often twice.  This means that aspects of some quests are easier with fewer players while other aspects might be easier with more players.  


Personally, I tend to view this not-perfect-scaling as a feature rather than a bug because it only adds to the replayability of quests.

Oh it's a feature, alright. But a feaature doesn't necessarily means it's good.

## 5 [dalestephenson on March 20, 2020](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/307005-things-that-couldve-been-better/?do=findComment&comment=3916995)

Good and bad are subjective terms that probably shouldn't be applied to game design.  Some players may value consistency of experience as player count scales, others may value change of experience as player count scales -- LOTR definitely changes with player count, but whether that is "good" or "bad" is purely subjective and player-dependent.

The same is true of Reveal N setups.  It adds variability to setup, but whether that's a good thing or not is purely a matter of preference.

Of the OP points, location is a matter of game design.  The game is designed to have only one location, and that *by design* causes location lock to be more likely as player count increases.  Doomed keyword *by design* affects all players and again scales unevenly with player count.  However, the remaining points are not *game* design, but scenario design.  The game system does not require treacheries to affect all players (many don't), the game system does not require difficult enemies (some aren't), and the game system does not require brutal setup to scenarios (some aren't).  A particular player may desire that quests be more difficult on average, or easier on average, or more consistent difficulty, but there's *nothing* about the game design requires any particular difficulty level -- and the existence of both "easy mode" and nightmare quests shows the designers attempting to provide a wide difficulty range for the same quests.

The critcism of bad thematic cards is not related to game design at all, merely card design.  Nothing in the game design requires thematic cards to be bad.  If anything, narrowing the scope where a card can be played allows it to be more powerful without converting it into a staple.

In terms of game design, I see this as a puzzle game. Certain quests require different strategies with different amounts of players, and in my opinion, that just adds to the fun!

It is most definitely should, otherwise every game on earth would succeed because there is no bad design. There are bad designs. Some of them are subjective to player preference, some of them are more or less objective. Seeing how Arkham Horor LCG moved away from half of the encounter deck affecting each player, I think they understood that mathematical progression of encounter effects is not a healthy design and should be used very sparingly, if at all.

Reveal N setup is OK in vacuum, it's not OK in situations it leaves you within the basic game of LotR LCG. And I wasn't cracking just at random setups, there are plenty of fixed setups that demand immediate answers than you can't give most of the time, and then you get also swamped during questing.

My point was never that it wasn't *by design*, my point was that *this kind of design is bad, and causes bad game situations*. Scenario design is a part of the game design. I probably made it unclear when I was talking about cards that affect all players, but I didn't mean just treacheries. There are plenty of enemies and locations that screw over everyone. 

Once again, card design is a department of game design. Nothing requires, but there many unplayably bad nontheless. There is often a problem that they are worthless outside of their narrow scope, which is fine, but they are not even good within their narrow scope, which is not.

I'm glad it works out for you (not a sarcasm). The way I see it, though, being shoehorned into a particular deck/player number subtracts from fun, not adds to it.

I agree on some aspect of your thinking but disagree on the vast majority of what cause them. Have you been playing in other LCG cooperative games? Other cooperative games? I do have, and try to think about what difference exist and let to the conclusion that our problem are:

1/ No REAL difficulty levels. I mean easy and normal modes aren't that different, nightmare is on a different package that need to be buy, is half release almost only in english. Such games with many way to be played should have many way to change the difficulty of the game. So very different players (such me who find most nightmare way too easy, and you who find most normal too hard) enjoy most part of the game.

2/ The need of  a real clock pressure. Something that push you to go further in the scenario rather than just using your action to get to an ideal situation. It was supposed to be the threat but quite early we realize that we can bring down the threat quite efficiency, at the point that I usually end up a game at a lower threat that I begun...

Time counters, mount doom mechanic, race scenario are some exemples of scenario that make this working way better, but it should be on the core of the game

3/ The game should not be about building a board always better. Allies are just too strong. They stay at every turn, are adaptable about questing or fighting or even sacrificing against enemies attack. Best decks often are the ones who are able to play many allies each turn. Having allies that have a once per game cost and then produce a value each turn is not viable. It will obiously lead to a situation where you need to stand up to the point where you have no difficulty at all to win.
How to solve it? Not being allowed to have more than X allies, have allies that require to be payed each turn (new wilyador, dwarven sellsword), allies that dies from themselves after some turns or use.
Of course for some balance attachment need to be watched too. Especially readying effects, who have to get the same restriction as allies.

With those element fixed we can fix the rest of the game accordingly but they are the key problem to me.

Any game that is loved by a particular set of people is not, objectively speaking, a bad game.  Not all games rise to that threshold.  It's also the case that a game design could fail to achieve what its designer *hoped* it would do.  Candyland is not badly designed if your goal is to let small children have a decision-free, luck-based competition requiring no reading skills.  Candyland *is* badly designed if you are trying to attract adult gamers wanting meaningful decisions.

That doesn't mean that "bad" and "good" should necessarily be avoided, just because it's subjective.  If I say that Escape from Dol Goldur is a bad one-deck quest or that Sleeping Sentry is a bad card, I'm giving my subjective view -- and I suspect it's the view of a majority of players.  But we both know that there's some masochists out there who want to play the Kobayashi Maru and enjoy the challenge of knocking off EfDG solo.  They probably played Passage Through Mirkwood with the Tactics starter deck until they won, too.  *I* don't enjoy that, but that doesn't mean it was a design failure.  I suspect EfDG was specifically designed to encourage two-deck play, and the tactics core cards were explicitly designed not to be an all-around sphere.  You can't say the design failed unless you know what the design goals *were*, and if you don't like the results it doesn't mean the design failed its intended purpose -- it's quite possible you just don't like what it was actually designed to do.

We all agree that the possibility of location lock asymetrically affects the game according to player count, but it's only a design failure if it was never intended to do that!  I'm not convinced that is the case.  The fact that a later LCG (Arkham) has more uniform scaling in player count does not mean that LOTR's approach was a mistake, it only means Arkham is different.  Champions is different than Arkham, this doesn't mean that all the changes between Arkham and Champions were design failures by Arkham.  I don't see new LCGs as an attempt to attract the existing LCG players with something better.  I think they are intended to tempt both the existing audience and the non-LCG players with something *different*.  The itch scratched by the three cooperative LCG is not the same and I know of no designer statements that it was *meant* to be the same.

I don't think it's useful to lump scenario design and card design under game design.  The game design itself is what allows the possibilities, if something is disliked with that it will affect *all* scenarios and *all* cards.  That's not true with scenario design.  I don't like the one-key-card-that-wrecks-everything structure of Road to Rivendell, but Sleeping Sentry affects *only* Road to Rivendell.  It's even less true of player cards.  The End Comes may be a waste of cardstock, but that affects that card only.  And even weak cards can be rehabilitated -- my favorite new cards are cards that make old cards worth playing.

Scenario design, IMO, has steadily improved over the years, as has card design.  The underlying ruleset has remained essentially unchanged over that period of time, and continues to constrain the possibilities of scenario and card design.  I think the core would be "better" if a number of the player cards in it were better, and if Escape From Dol Goldur scaled more evenly with player count, but in the context of the full card/scenario pool I don't think it makes much difference.

I also think that even with location lock, doomed, and "each player" effects, it's not been shown the game actually is more difficult on average for more players.  "Fixing" only the effects that work against more players, while leaving intact the things that favor more players, would not provide evenly scaled difficulty according to number of players.

It's true that some scenarios with fixed setups can leave you with a demanding first round situation.  And some don't.  This has nothing to do with the rule system, it's just variety in quests themselves.  What sort of quest you prefer varies a lot according to player, but I think it's a lot easier practically speaking to make the quest easier with additional resources (or cards; I frankly prefer Seastan's Grace of the Valar variant to easy or semi-easy mode) than it is to make a quest more difficult, which argues for a default bias towards more difficult quests for the widest appeal.

As I've mentioned multiple times, I've been playing a lot of Arkham Horror LCG. In general, I've been playing many different co-operative boardgames over many years.

1. It's not just that I find the game too difficult in vacuum, it's more that I find that game expects me to play only the top tier stuff if I want a shot at winning, which is an aspect I don't enjoy. 

2. Arkham Horror LCG introduced separate quests deck for bad guys and good guys, which is a very good way to handle this.

3. My point is that the game shouldn't be about something in particular. It should let the player approach and beat it with many different combinations of tools it gives them, not giving them many different tools but only letting them win with one or two.

I don't agree. An objectively bad game can be loved. Have you ever heard of a movie called "The Room"? It's an objectively bad movie, yet it is loved by many including yours truly. That being said, I never said LotR LCG is a bad game, I merely said that I think listed design choices are bad and are hurting the game.

I'm not discussing design goals and if they failed or not. I'm discussing results purely, and they are not great and could've been better.

Game design is a very broad term, which includes card design and scenario design. Basically everything that is gameplay related.

I don't think the game should be "fixed" at this point, or if it even can be fixed. The reprocussions are running too deep. One of the reasons I think the game should be given a second edition, like GoT.

Late to the discussion (as usual), but sphere balance has long been a bee in my bonnet.

In terms of "fixing" the game I would agree that it can't be fixed exactly, but I don't believe it needs to be.  Is it perfect?  No.  Do I want to return to a limited format in order to make it better?  Also no.  I vastly prefer the imperfect, deep card pool we have now to that.  Can it be made better?  Probably.  Should it be made better?  Not worth it imo.

I had never heard of "The Room", so I looked it up.  It objectively was unsuccessful on release and objectively has attracted a cult following by this point of time.  Whether it met the design goals of its self-financing creator is (I gather) unknown and unknowable.  Labelling it an "objectively bad movie" requires objective standards, constructed and agreed-upon without this particular movie in mind -- this may be possible among a wide swathe of the viewing public.

But "bad movies" are loved *because* they are bad, and this is independent of whether they were intended to be bad or not.  Plan 9 From Outer Space perhaps never meant to hit that target, Lost Skeleton of Kadaver certainly did.  As the popularity of MST3K showed, it can not only be fun to mock "bad" movies, it can be fun to watch people mock bad movies.  Some of my kids seek out "bad" fan-fiction just to mock it--I draw the line there, my life is too short to waste my time with that.  Even video games can attract cult love from percieved badness -- Somebody Set Us Up The Bomb!

But in all my time on BGG I've never run across a cluster of gamers seeking out games because they consider them objectively bad, and play them for that reason.  I *have* seen BGGers dismiss games for being "objectively bad" that turned out to be smash hits among 12-14 year old boy scouts at scout camp.  But the scouts loved these games not because they were "bad", but because the "objective" flaws seen by BGGers -- for instance, extreme randomness and player elimination -- were positive virtues to the scouts.  The objective standards shared by the labelling BGGers were not shared by fans of the actual game.  There are *very few* "objective standards" in boardgames that can be applied, perhaps none.  Any game that finds an audience has done *something* right.

But as you point out, you're not labelling the game itself bad, just certain things that you find bad.  That's fine, but it's not *objectively* bad without objective standards for it to violate.  Those are lacking here.  That certain game effects scale against player count *is* objective -- that effects scaling against player count is "bad" is subjective.  To my mind, even if you accept that overall difficulty should scale evenly against player count, it does not follow that all *effects* in the game must scale evenly.  If positive and negative scaling effects roughly balance, you have even scaling while introducing asymetric play with player count, which some (myself included) would see as a good thing.  And if some *quests* scale in different directions, some (myself included) could also see that as a good thing.  Further, in a game with positive and negative scaling effects, if you "fix" only one side of the equation you end up *unbalancing* with player count in a uniform fashion, which some (including myself) would see as a bad thing.

I think we can all agree that the game "could be better", but your ideas, and my ideas, and Rouxxor's ideas about what would make it better are not going to be the same, and in some cases the perceived remedy is directly opposed.  And even if we could all agree amongst ourselves that (for example) Sleeping Sentry was a terrible design, that doesn't mean the designers didn't want it to work exactly in the annoying way that it actually operates.  I'm also inclined to cut some slack to things that "could be better" when I consider that the game as a whole is subjectively Fantastic, a lifestyle game I expect to keep me amused for decades to came.

Yes, I agree that new LCGs are made with "old experience" in mind.  But I totally disagree that the "old experience" was that the past design choices "were not very good".  I think it's more the case that the "old experience" that appeals to the old audience already *has* the old game and recreating that game from scratch with a tiny card pool wouldn't be interesting.  So the designers look for something they think will appeal to a *new* audience.

I can't speak to Arkham/Champions differences, but I can speak to LOTR/Champions differences.  I have all the published content for Champions, and I like the game.  Certainly some of the changes (IP aside) address some of the things that have put off potential LOTR players over the years.  You're playing as a single hero, not as a set of heroes.  You always can use the cards in your hands, even if only as fuel.  You don't have to worry about complexities like many action windows, or sentinel/ranged.  Playing Champions is definitely a more streamlined experience than playing LOTR.  It is also (so far) a much easier to win experience.

But most of all, it is a *different* experience, and though it's barely begun its life and no doubt has a huge amount of player cards and scenarios ahead of it, it's clear the streamlined game system will *never* deliver the subtleties of hero and deck interaction that LOTR is capable of.  It may well wind up finding a larger audience than LOTR, but it's also not the same audience, and the design choices made to simplify the game are not rectifying design mistakes, they are simply making the new game system something different than the old game system.  And for me, the old game system is subjectively better.  If they had made the same design decisions when originally designing LOTR, it would be a different game and IMO an inferior one.

"Game design" used in such a broad fashion to describe the entire corpus of a modular game makes the term not useful for discussion.  In the interest of using common terms, I will use "rule system" to describe the structure of the game.  The rule system affects 100% of the game.  A scenario design affects about 1% of the game, since there are about 100 scenarios.  A card design affects far less, since there are many hundreds of player cards (less heroes, so maybe 1% for them).

Cards and scenarios can be "fixed" with errata, though the designers have largely restricted errata to player card nerfs.  More than that, they can also be ignored by releasing *more* scenarios and *more* player cards not having the same issues as the original.  Does Escape from Dol Goldur scale badly against solo one-deck?  Virtually every quest ever release after that one doesn't scale as badly.  Is having one game-ending treachery/shadow in an otherwise unthreatening quest a design failure?  If so, what later scenario ever repeated it?  Are first cycle allies hideously overpriced?  Allies released *since* then usually aren't.

With the exception of locations, which are part of the rule system, every one of your objections about quests could be addressed in a *new* quest simply by not doing the things you object to--if they agreed with your assessment that the quest would be better without those things.  As for bad/mediocre thematic cards, they've published a vast number of good/great thematic cards lately.

So what's to fix?  Short of *positive* errata to go with their stealth nerfs, or new nightmare quests for the ones without those, there's not much that can be done for released content.  But new content can continue to be of ever-higher quality.  At least in card design, I think the current and previous cycles is showing the designers at the top of their game.  The one thing I would expect from new content, should it ever resume after the current cycle, is a change in how new content is packaged, making it more free-standing and in fewer new SKUs.  Logistically keeping the product available is a nightmare that gets continually worse.

An incompatible second edition strikes directly at the game's strongest point, its deep and varied pool of quests and cards.  Reboots might be practical in a competitive game where older content ages out of rotation and the real game is playing against each other.  But in a cooperative game like this I can't see it happening.  This game is at its best as the options explode, attempting to return to ground zero when the existing game is so compelling would be very very poorly received, I think.

Sure. But the system, how you play a card, what a card does, how the opponent react is not bounded in any way to the way to build a deck. So we can compare them. I do prefer the building system of LoTR, and that is why I haven't buy anything from those two other LCG. But I think they have done a better job in making their rules.

As someone who thinks allies are too strong, Rouxxor, I think you would really appreciate the consequential damage nearly all the Champions allies are cursed with.  It also has a per-player ally limit.

But so far, building your board state before getting down to destroying the villain is very much the game-winning strategy.

I would also toss in "improper scaling". You mentioned the locations being a frustrating one, especially if you flip multiple copies of "cannot place progress on locations in staging" effects. I also saw, tonight, how a "x players" card affected an enemy's attack. I thought that was pretty bologna... "so in one player, an ally could take him, in 4 player, not even Beregond could survive?" Things find themselves compounding in linear fashion and there are times I wish it was just a set median number -- "flip 2 into staging" instead of "flip x". Does that objectively make it harder for solo? Sure! But the x appears so often it would be nice to have a median that 4 players can help overcome. 

## 19 [NathanH on March 22, 2020](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/307005-things-that-couldve-been-better/?do=findComment&comment=3917712)

I think in general that the different ways that encounter card/encounter deck mechanics scale in LotR and AH are appropriate to the overall design. In AH, there is less synergy and co-operation between decks, and it's more difficult for player decks to build up board states that oppress the encounter deck, so it is appropriate for most effects and mechanics to scale more or less linearly with the player count. In LotR, however, two decks will tend to be more powerful combined than two apart, even if you haven't put a huge amount of thought into co-operation, and very much more powerful if you have. It is also much easier to create large board states that can easily absorb a single encounter card. Therefore the encounter deck needs some combos and needs some help with scaling to fight back.

Consider locations in a four-player game. Sure, you are likely to end up with an increasing number of locations in the staging area every turn, unless you are clearing them out with location control. However, it's not likely to be more than one or two additional locations a turn if you're clearing out the active location. If you're managing monsters efficiently, then it hardly seems too much to ask for a four-player team to increase their available willpower by 5 every turn.

Interesting, most of this has never bothered me aside from doomed cards being nearly unplayable- An issue which I must say they did an incredible job fixing with Saruman and his staff, a deck which I have absolutely loved playing and has effectively made those once ignored cards viable. 

While I fully agree that some of the quests on normal mode are so difficult that only seasoned players looking for a challenge will enjoy them, I think the balance of easy quests, quests that are fairly easy but can usually beat in an attempt or two but aren't a cake walk, and serious challenges is incredibly impressive. Also they do have an easy mode so this is a bit silly to take serious issue with since its really easy to get your sought after experience out of it.

There is a lot of posts to answer, and even reading them takes a lot of time, and I got a whole day of work ahead of me, so excuse me for being compact in my response. 

 

dalestephenson, I'm not sure what this whole thing about, I never said LotR LCG was objectively bad, I just said I didn't like some segments of it, and while making enemies insanely strong can be argued as a subjective thing, I am willing to stand until my last breath for things like not scaling number of active locations or doomed being an objectively bad design.

They didn't try to replicate LotR LCG, but game elements unavoidably overlap, and when they do, they didn't make the same mistakes again. I think if they made those descicions when designing the LotR LCG originally, the game would be a much more balanced and enjoyable by wider margin. 

Even if they agreed with my opinion, there is nothing they can do at this point in time with the game we have on our hands. If they suddenly turn around and change their entire design philosophy, many things just break down and stop working. And thats why I think 2nd edition would be a good thing thats never gonna happen :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

Khamul, so far you sound like the only jokester in this thread.
 

player3351457, yeah thats funny how they created an inveronment when multiplayer games get flooded with locations in the staging area because they can't efficiently explore them via the in-game means, so players are forced to use stuff like trackers to get out of such pickles, so then designers create cards that counter even those venues of resistance :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

NathanH, I don't agree. I've played a lot of uncoordinated LotR LCG multiplayer back in the day, and when the decks are just solo decks that players have brought to play together - it rarely ended well. Those games were mostly an uphill struggle until the bitter hopeless end. I'm not sure if intentional or not, but it seems like LotR is trying to compensate lack of time pressure (agenda deck in AH LCG), pushing away casual players that try to have a fun and balanced game in the process.

 

programdude, that's just as I said - Doomed in its current state can only work with a so called cruth, Saruman's Staff in this case. As for the difficulty, easy mode, and stuff... for a very long time that I played this game, no such thing as an easy mode existed. Even then when it was introduced, I don't want to rely on going online and looking stuff up every time I want to play a quest, setting up a regular quest is a cumbersome task by itself, it doesn't need any extra steps. As an additional note, such thing as appropriate balance for the content should be a thing. Looking back at core set days, there is one semi-balanced quest, and two nearly ubeatable unless giant encounter draw luck + an extremely finely tuned deck. And problems like these went through a lot of products. It's OK to have quests on a more of a diffuclt side, but not when they are the most of the quests that the game has, with saner ones being very few and far inbetwixt.

 

I am sorry for the scarcityy of my replies, but it took me more than a hour to read through everything and form my thoughts and reply even in this compact manner, and as I mentioned, there is a very busy day ahead of me. Thank you for your replies.

I just really don't think most of the quests are insane in terms of difficulty. I think in an average block of content there will be 2-3 rather challenging quests, with the rest ranging from easy to average. I think they did an excellent job with the range of challenge considering they need to appeal to casual and serious gamers alike.

And yes we agree about doomed cards, but I immensely respect them giving us a way to actually viably play them with Saruman as opposed to just leaving them as dead cards in the binder.

Agreed.  

Its difficult to put into words, but I think the short answer is that Lord of the Rings is a unique deck building game in that unlike almost all deck building games in that you don't build a deck to beat the game or beat your opponent, you instead build a deck to solve the current puzzle (quest).

Now grant it there are ways with sufficient card pool to create niche decks that can become the sort of "ultimate deck" that is powerful enough to beat most quests in the game but those are so very specific and there really are very few of them, most of which leverage min/maxing and poorly designed cards with a few assumptions (like owning 2 core sets for example).

Generally this is a game of solving a puzzle via deck building and most of the problems described by the OP are not "all quests" problems, but very specific quests.  For example most quests do now have Location heavy encounter decks, some do, but most don't.  Most encounter decks don't rely on the Doom mechanic, same goes with enemy design.  

Each quest is unique and requires a unique deck(s) to beat it and the challenge of the game is building that deck for that quest.  For the next quest you will likely again have to alter your deck.  

I think the mindset of "build one deck to beat them all" is a kind of carry over from most deck building games and a attribute/attitude players bring over in this game which ultimately leads to disappointment.   If however you recognize how Lord of the Rings is different and that the challenge is to build decks to beat specific quests, if you embrace that concept, then the game opens up to you and a lot of the design starts to make a lot more sense.

A good example is Conflict at The Carrock.  Most new players really struggle with this quest because up until you hit it, most of the quests leading up to it in that series don't really require anything particularly specific as far as design or strategy goes.  Most halfway decent decks will do.  Conflict At The Carrock is the first time when you must adjust your deck for a very specific challenge and most players that figure out can eventually beat the quest 100% of the time even on nightmare because there is a puzzle to solve here and once solved a quest that seemed impossible to beat becomes fairly easy to defeat consistently.

From Carrock on, this is how the game challenges you.  Now of course there are some quests that really are super tough and you might not be able to find a solution to the puzzle with your current card pool. I dont think that is intentional but it does happen (depending on how you collect).  As an owner of almost the entire collecting I have many quests I have never beaten but I know there is a solution to those puzzles, I just havent found it and I have always intentionally avoided seeking out the answer online.  The game stays fresh and interesting for me knowing that there are still challenges waiting for me in my collection.

I totally agree with the location issue you comment. The whole location mechanics is not very well thought off. Arkham definitely does a better job in that sense.

The other thing I agree with is the difficulty and the bad/mediocre but thematic cards. I don’t think the game is difficult, but I do think that it does not leave too much room for those who, like my wife, likes making decks with thematic cards.

Yes, you never said LOTR was objectively bad, but you're still saying that not scaling number of active locations and doomed being "objectively bad design".  No matter how much you don't like them, neither is "objectively bad".  It is *not* an objective principal of game design that co-op scenarios must have the same difficulty at all player counts -- and more to the point, it's not the case that LOTR has been *shown* to bias difficulty against multplayer.  *Many* quests are easier in multiplayer and this is especially true in the earliest cycles.  Having elements of the game that scale against multiple players is IMO *good* design when there are also elements of the game that scale against fewer players.

New iterations of similar systems may lack things you don't like -- this does *not* prove that it was a design mistake that the designers rectified.  It could just as easily be the case that it's an element the designers recognize that some do not like, and they are trying to design a game more to your taste.  In the case of Marvel Champions, it lacks both threat and any equivalent to locations, so it did NOT fix any alleged problem with scaling, it just removed the element entirely.  "Each player" effects from the encounter deck exist, but are rare -- and the consensus so far is that the game is easier as player count increases.

Except for the design of location which is baked into the rules system, *every one* of your complaints could be addressed by the designers in *every* new quest released, simply by not doing the things you complain about.  Not one of them are required to be done in any quest.  They also *did* do something about quest difficulty by introducing easy mode, and all reprints of older quests pre-easy mode have the gold circles, making it easy to set up (I've also altered my pre-easy prints by coloring in the white circles on the "easy mode" removal cards.  Semi-easy is *extremely* simple and makes a large difference in difficulty level.

I don't know why you think a reboot would fix your complaints.  A 2.0 rules system with a different location system could invalidate all the current content, but it would do *nothing* to prevent the designers from using "each player" encounter effects (including raising threat, which is what Doomed does), tough enemies, tough setups, and tough normal difficulty.  As the current cycle shows, the designers are still making full use of all the things you complain about -- they obviously *don't* think these things are design mistakes, they are Working As Intended.

They both actually are, and my feelings towards them are irrelevant. Even if they were two of my most loved game features, they create unhealthy game situations which you can't argue against. It doesn't make mathematical sense. Quests are easier in multiplayer, especially in early cycles, because of bad game design decisions. Off the top of my head, I think second stage of journey down the anduin has you revelaing 1 additional card each quest phase regardless of the number of players, so if you're solo - your encounter card count doubles, if you're four players - your encounter card count increases by 25%. If that's not an objectively bad game design decision in your book - I don't really know if there can be anything objectively bad for you at all, and just propose to agree to disagree. "Having elements of the game that scale against multiple players is IMO *good* design" - there is already an inbuilt scaling element: number of encounter cards on setup (sometimes) and per turn scales with the number of players. There is no actual need to scale and spread the effects themselves, because if in a 4 player game each player drew a card that affects each player, then players have essentially drawn 16 worth of encounter cards, and this is an objectively bad design outcome.

 

It doesn't to you, it does to me. I see this as an evolution. Bad design elements get shaved off, better and more refined ones get introduced. Don't really see the point of Marvel Champions dropping locations altogether as a supposed fix to only one location problem. I didn't play MC, but I watched some vids, and if I remember correctly, the way questing there works is you just exhaust a character and progress immediately pops up. The concept of locations from LotR simply doesn't work there in any capacity. Also I'm fine with effects that affect each player in general, I'm not fine with the amount and power of them that are used in LotR. AH LCG also has effects that affect all players, but they are much more sophisticated and make sense.

 

I don't see how Doomed situation can be addressed by the designers in any capacity except for crutches like Saruman's staff. 

 

Because reboot would imply they would need to make new content by the new standards. There gonna be no disbalance due to the gap between god tier and thematic trash cards, there would be no 900 basic attack enemies with 1000 health popping on first turns to get you regardless of your threat, etc. Of course the designers do what they do - they're in this too deep. They can't just abandon their design philosophy at this point, or many previous points. Magic the Gathering is one of the worst competitive card games on the market, immensively outdated (I'm not gonna argue on this, I'll just say that a game which you can lose just because you didn't draw mana or drew too much mana is not a good game) and is in severe need of reboot and rules revamp, but it's never gonna happen. Why? Because they are in it too deep. If they do it, they will lose on profits, they will invalidate the collections of all the people who are bringing them money. So they're not gonna do it. Are they correct from the financial standpoint? **** yes they are. Are they correct from the gameplay standpoint? **** no they arent.

To do well in LotR LCG, you need to be really good at building decks. Many of the problems pointed out by John Constantine can be countered, as dalestephenson argued, by building a good deck to get around them. He rightly points out that the full card pool offers many tools that, when put together in the right combinations, can provide an answer to everything from location lock to Doomed to overwhelming dark forces during setup to scaling encounter effects. However, if you don't put together the tools in the right combination, the encounter deck will stomp you mercilessly.

The necessity of strong deck-building can be a source of major frustration for many players. If you don't have a solid deck design going in, there is no degree of expert game playing tactics or strategy that will overcome that deficit. This is not to say that knowing how to play the game well doesn't matter at all. As was pointed out earlier, many top-tier decks require a top-tier player to pilot them -- a novice will still likely lose if they don't understand how to take advantage of the deck's potential. The necessity of expert deck-building skill is mitigated by community resources like RingsDB, where players can find ready-made decks and often very detailed strategy guides to go with them. However, that's a LOT of homework for the average player, especially a new player. And it takes experience to learn how to properly pilot a top-tier deck and to learn how to deploy its tools to counter whatever nasty thing the encounter deck throws at you.

Bottom line, for me, is that the game and quest design places a huge emphasis on deck-building, and less on actually playing the game. Maybe, to hazard a guess, it's like 70/30 in terms of importance. That's great for those who love the in-depth research and skill required to build good decks, but far less so for the players who want to just jump in and enjoy the adventure. This isn't a flaw in the game, per se, but can definitely frustrate players who aren't that great at deck-building, but also don't want to feel like they're 'cheating' or missing a crucial component of the game by copying the decks of others.

And if opening encounter draws weren't bad enough, you only start out wth 3 resources, with which you can't buy jackshit, but with which you are somehow expected to efficianly quest, attack and defend right off the bat. Players should either have more starting resources, or there shouldn't be so much encounter cards ahead of the first quest phase, unless absolutely necessary. Depending on a mild starting encounter draw to have at least the chance to play the game is not a very good design.


What frustrates my group the most is, Setup: Put X number of cards into the staging area where X is the number of players in the game.

These setups can end games before they start because you can reveal 4 enemies with the setup and then the encounter phase reveals 4 more enemies. Sometimes the setup doesn't even have enemies but enough 3+ threat locations that it's insurmountable without Rohan cards to wack the locations off the board.

Agree with Kjeld.  Everything mentioned in OP list is perfect for the game.  This game requires deckbuilding skills with thought out synergies in your deck to maneuver all issues you might come across during a quest.  Some people may not be about the deck design aspect too much, which is almost half of what this game is, as well as very thought out decision making during each phase of a quest while playing.  

The comments about the game being too difficult I definitely do not understand - I hate playing meta, in board games and video games.  As soon as outlands came out and was overpowered I refused to play it.  All this being said, most quests are very doable, many can be won with 95%-99% winrate and need nightmare to even be playable.  Others are perfect on normal mode.  I think it all comes down to how good of a player you are.  If you aren't a very good player, then this game can be difficult to you.

Kjeld, yeah, I know, if you are so inclined, you can "snipe" the quests by building specifically for each one. I've done so myself. I recall building a Hobbit deck that had all the Black Riders in the frist LotR Saga quests engaged with me and attacking each phase, but being absolutely unable to strike through the fast hitching burning branded Bilbo with some +def signals. This deck turned the quest into a joke. The problem is, in my opinion, the game gives you a lot of toys, and when you try to play with them, it slaps you around, forcing you to either come back to the the usual suspect OP stuff, or "sniping" the quests, neither of which I enjoy. I think basic difficulty should be mainly reserved for people building regular/thematic decks, and the hard/nightmare stuff should be subject to sniping/abusing OP stuff. When almost every quest in the game has to be either abused or sniped - it's not that fun anymore. 

 

Thaeggan, yeah, setup X situation also highlight the problem with the multiplicated encounter card effects, creating situation when you may as well start over without even beginning to play, not to mention creating a giant pressure at the beginning without establishing proper tools for players to handle it.

 

I'm sorry Khamul, but any attempt from your end to invalidate me as a player fades behind the fact that you think that everything I've listed is perfect for the game, so I can't really do anything for you here.

That was not my experience at all. I got into this game a couple of years ago and started collecting content whenever I could find some in my area. From basically the start (when we had only 1 Core Set, Khazad-dum + Dwarrowdelf, Heirs of Numeros + Againts the Shadow) me and my wife played together a 4 decks fellowship with 4 mono sphere decks, augmenting the decks when we got new cards (we switched SpEowyn with Arwen when we got The Dread Realm for example or added some Hauberk of Mail and Guarded attachment with Wilds of Rhovanion) but maintaining the same general backbone of synergies between them and we actually won all the quest of the game with those deck (only lone expection Mount Doom). And we are playing Elrond with no Vilya...

There have been quests where we cursed playing as 4 players and others where we were so glad for not having to use a single deck, there have been quest where it took us around 3 games to finally beat it, having to adapt our basic strategies to the current problem but playing as 4 you can have enough flexibility in your decks to bring a generic toolbox able to face almost any problem. For example we found Carn-Dum a relative breeze, thanks to the mono-spirit deck having Shadows Give Way as an event (which is still quite useful in a lot of other questo) that acts as a silver bullet against it. Instead we struggled terribly against The Wastes of Eriador which is generally considered a not-so-difficult one.

That's only to give our perspective and experience, perhaps shedding some light on other approaches.

I don't have any experience playing the game 4 players and officially its a 2 player game which suggests that it was never really tested/designed to be a 4 player game.  I can however imagine with 4 players, the amount of synergy you can create would probably allow for a greater diversity in the decks which might not require you to alter them as much.

My experiences have always been solo or 2 player so I can only speak to that.

Its written on the box. 

I don't think its a stretch to assume a 1-2 player game released as such is not tested for 3-4 players.  Would you assume they tested the game at 8 players?

That's only because the contents of one Core Set (mainly the Threat Trackers, which is kinda of a ludicrous thing I admit) are assumed to be enough only for 2 players, but the rules have always considered the game to be playable with 1 to 4 players (as you can find written in like the first or second page of the Rules booklet).

> They both actually are, and my feelings towards them are irrelevant. Even if they were two of my most loved game features, they create unhealthy game situations which you can't argue against. It doesn't make mathematical sense. Quests are easier in multiplayer, especially in early cycles, because of bad game design decisions. Off the top of my head, I think second stage of journey down the anduin has you revelaing 1 additional card each quest phase regardless of the number of players, so if you're solo - your encounter card count doubles, if you're four players - your encounter card count increases by 25%. If that's not an objectively bad game design decision in your book - I don't really know if there can be anything objectively bad for you at all, and just propose to agree to disagree. "Having elements of the game that scale against multiple players is IMO *good* design" - there is already an inbuilt scaling element: number of encounter cards on setup (sometimes) and per turn scales with the number of players. There is no actual need to scale and spread the effects themselves, because if in a 4 player game each player drew a card that affects each player, then players have essentially drawn 16 worth of encounter cards, and this is an objectively bad design outcome.

I presume your "they both actually are" is a claim that both locations and Doomed are "objectively bad".  *If* you think that that inconsistent difficulty level for number of players is inherently the result of "bad game design decisions", then yes, inconsistent difficulty level are the result of "bad game design decisions".  But that's a preference, not a law of design.  And even if you think consistency of difficulty level is desirable (this is subjective, but common), I can't think of an interesting co-op game I've ever played that's actually achieved it.

More than that, you are here complaining about effects that scale against multiple players *despite one-deck play probably being harder*.  If the problems you complained about were fixed, it would *increase* player imbalance, not reduce it.

Yes, the extra card in the second stage of JDtA is harder for solo players.  So is the fixed amount of progress needed to clear the second stage.  So is the presence of exactly one troll in staging at the very beginning of the quest.  The quest is not balanced.  But changing the second stage to reveal N extra cards *wouldn't* make the balance scale evenly, because the likelihood of location lock is much higher with 8 reveals than 2 reveals!  Goblin Sniper, Brown Lands, and all the treacheries scale against multiplayer -- with N extra reveals it's quite possible the quest would be *easier* solo.  LOTR has a mass of effects that work for *and* against more players, the end balance of a quest depends very much on how those pieces come together, and it's not always symetrical.  I don't even think it's *meant* to be symetrical.  My suspicion is that Escape From Dol Goldur was designed *specifically* to show new players sometimes you need to use more decks.  That makes it too difficult for my taste as a solo player, but I can't say the designers "failed" to make the quest scale evenly when there's no evidence that was ever their goal!

But the fact that quests may scale evenly, or scale against less players, or scale against more players, only tells us that the rules system doesn't dictate player scaling.  That's a matter of scenario design.  And it literally *does not matter* how well or poorly balanced any past quests have been -- each *new* scenario will have player balance according to its own design.  That's why "fixing" the problem with a reboot accomplishes nothing -- it does nothing to change balance for old quests, and it's not needed to achieve balance for new quests.

> 8 hours ago, John Constantine said:
> 
> It doesn't to you, it does to me. I see this as an evolution. Bad design elements get shaved off, better and more refined ones get introduced. Don't really see the point of Marvel Champions dropping locations altogether as a supposed fix to only one location problem. I didn't play MC, but I watched some vids, and if I remember correctly, the way questing there works is you just exhaust a character and progress immediately pops up. The concept of locations from LotR simply doesn't work there in any capacity. Also I'm fine with effects that affect each player in general, I'm not fine with the amount and power of them that are used in LotR. AH LCG also has effects that affect all players, but they are much more sophisticated and make sense.[/q]

This is presumably a response to my claim that changes to new co-op LCGs are not necessarily fixing design mistakes.  *Any* effect that comes from the encounter deck is inherently strongly as player count increases.  You were claiming in the OP this was a design mistake, now you are just complaining about their frequency and power?  Sounds like it's not a *design* problem after all, just that their use of it is not to your taste.

Placing damage on the main villain is somewhat akin to "questing", in that the villain essentially has stages and damage placed is how you advance to the next stage of the villain and ulimately win the game.  But damage can be and often is placed by card effect rather than the basic "attack" action, and the closest equivalent to threat is thwarting, where you *remove* progress the scenario places on the cards that make you lose (again, this can be a basic action).  It's a simpler system than LOTR, and guess what -- in practice, it scales against less players, at least so far.

The closest equivalent to locations are the side schemes, which typically start with a fixed amount of threat that you need to thwart away to make it go poof.  As there's no raise-your-threat-from-unsuccessful-questing element to the game, the role of traveling to a location doesn't make sense here, but the class of side schemes with the "crisis" icons mandate that you thwart them in preference to the main scheme -- filling the same buffer role that the active location does in LOTR.

It's a different game.  It's not a "fixed" LOTR.  If you squint hard you can see it as a streamlined LOTR, but that says nothing about whether the original design was flawed in any particular way.  Designing Catan Jr. doesn't mean that missing elements from the original Catan were objectively badly designed.

I never said the encounter deck consisted of globalized effects dough. It's something you apparently thought I meant, which I didn't. The amount and power of them in this game is unhealthy.

There gonna be no disbalance due to the gap between god tier and thematic trash cards, there would be no 900 basic attack enemies with 1000 health popping on first turns to get you regardless of your threat, etc. Of course the designers do what they do - they're in this too deep. They can't just abandon their design philosophy at this point, or many previous points. Magic the Gathering is one of the worst competitive card games on the market, immensively outdated (I'm not gonna argue on this, I'll just say that a game which you can lose just because you didn't draw mana or drew too much mana is not a good game) and is in severe need of reboot and rules revamp, but it's never gonna happen. Why? Because they are in it too deep. If they do it, they will lose on profits, they will invalidate the collections of all the people who are bringing them money. So they're not gonna do it. Are they correct from the financial standpoint? **** yes they are. Are they correct from the gameplay standpoint? **** no they arent.

Saruman's Staff certainly makes Doomed more palatable for multiplayer, and in that respect might be a "crutch" for cards like Grima that were multiplayer-unfriendly.  But *most* Doomed events among the player cards had "each player" effects to go with the each player threat raise -- which is certainly a well balanced way to address "the doomed situation".  By undoing the doomed effect partially or completely, Saruman's Staff makes cards like Deep Knowledge and Legacy of Numenor much *strongeer* as player count increases.  Do you deplore that as a bad design decision?

For quests, it's easy as pie for designers to "fix" doomed if they think it's a design mistake to raise all player's threat as a result of an encounter card -- don't use it.  Use of the "doomed" keyword in a quest is *not* required, and the use of it varies wildly between quests.  The most recent quest released has a grand total of one encounter card that uses it (Weary Lands, 2 copies [1 in easy mode]) and it's a whoppiing Doomed 1.  The "doomed situation" for this quest is positively trivial.

I don't know why you think a reboot is required to create content according to "new standards" -- or why you think a reboot *would* change the standards the designers use in the first place.  If they thought "new standards" were required, they can just use new standards.  Certainly over the years we've seen changes in the way player cards have been costed, the average strength of enemies, and the variability of strength in the encounter deck.

In fact, the designers have done something much better (IMO) than gratitouslty invalidating a great mass of content in the hopes that their new incompatible card base will be better -- they've introduced new cards that make older, weaker cards better.  Power of the Earth is actually *useful* in a Woodman deck.  Beorning Beekeepr is seeing some use in Beorning decks.  Hero Gwaihir is going to get Born Aloft and Meneldor's Flight played.  Lothriel makes those cruddy discardable Gondorians worth considering.  Tactics Bilbo even accomplished the near impossible task of making Spirit Pippin worth playing.  I don't think designers are infallible (I'm one of the quickest and loudest to complain whenever their latest ill-conceived and unnecessary errata hit), but I think they've done a *remarkable* job of keeping old cards relevant, and I still enjoy playing old quests with new cards too.  You'd prefer they errata the entire game out of existence to "fix" your subjective preferences, even when there's absolutely no guarantee that they would change things you don't like in the direction you prefer?  I'll take a hard pass on that.

Playing one-handed and two-handed, I've never found rebuilding the deck to be a *requirement*.  Generally I might take in/out a few sideboard cards, but the only two quests that have required to me to redo my deck are Escape from Mount Gram and Dungeons Deep and Cavern Dim.  I've never had to swap out heroes to defeat a quest.  (I don't play nightmare, though.)

Conflict of the Carrock to me isn't an example of a quest that wants a specific deck *design*, just one that requires a different strategy.  Its easy start makes it easy to overquest, so a deck that's fully capable of winning the quest *if they use the right strategy* can tear through the first stage and then get stomped by four trolls.  Once you know you need to turtle until you're ready for the trolls, there are a *lot* of decks that can win the quest easily and consistently.

Personally, I don't see this is a flaw, because if it were true the game would have long ago lost most of the dedicated players who have been keeping it alive.

There's always a balance between making a game to hard, so that nobody wants to play anymore, and too easy, so that nobody wants to play anymore. The optimal for game longevity is obviously somewhere in the middle.  But no matter where you set the difficulty, you disappoint some people that want it more in one direction or the other. That's inevitable. Clearly you are someone who wanted it to be easier. But if we step back and ask if it's an actual "flaw" of the game for the difficulty to be set where it is, I would point to its longevity being much longer than expected as evidence that it's not.

I agree and some of the responses to me kind of support that.

For example when dalestephenson [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/256741-dalestephenson/] pointed out that to him adjusting decks for Carrock is not necessary.  It may not be necessary for him, as he see's the games difficulty as lower, then I do.  I for example have never been able to beat any quest on Nightmare mode, to me they are physically impossible to beat.  Clearly that is a matter of skill, it could be a matter of card pool, an amount of games played, or even bringing over just general gamer experiance.

The game has to manage to be fun for me and fun for guys like dalestephenson under the same mechanic and same conditions.

This is why I always say that Arkam Horror is such a big let down for me, to me it does exactly what I don't want a game to be, its balance is meant to be "fun for everyone".  Which is great but what that really means is that the game is stupidly easy even for guys like me, I can't imagine how boring it must be for the more experienced gamers. Me and my friends literally unboxed Arkham Horror (with the Dunwhich Legacy Cycle) read the rules, played our first run through the whole campaign and beat every quest on the first try under normal difficulty.  It was the first and last time we ever played the game, its been collecting dust on my shelf ever since and I mostly regret buying into it so hard.  And here is the thing, no one disliked it, it was fun, there just was no point in ever playing it again, it was kind of like a legacy game.  You play it through once, you beat it and then your done with it.

Lord of the Rings on the other hand me and my friends are still trying to beat certain quests, we still have never successfully completed the Saga campaign.  People come up with new Deck Ideas all the time and it kind of drive the game back to the table . The fact that we struggle with it, that it seems unfair sometimes or even unbeatable, that's what keeps us coming back.

It sounds to you wrong. I'm saying that causal player that devotes his time to building a deck around theme/synergy that he likes instead of the usual OP stuff should stand a chance at beating at least a good portion of the quests. And, by the way, if the game had a better entry point and didn't obliterate newcomers with no chances in 2 out of 3 starting quests, I don't think there would be any need for deadicated players to keep it alive - they would be plenty of players of all kinds. AH LCG has four basic difficulties + Nightmare (Return) mode and it is going strong. Lowest difficulty is literally for people you've described - the ones who devote no time to building or improving their decks and gameplay. Medium difficulty is for regular players that I'm describing here, who like theme and synergies over min-maxing. Hard+ is where the game starts to putting pressure on you to play a certain way, and when it starts resembling LotR in it's default state. 

And I in return would point out that if the tables were turned, it's longevity would be much longer, and people wouldn't have to wait ages for each individual pack to come out, because if the difficulty scaling was done right, the deadicated players would still have their experience with nightmare + bunch of inheritely harder quests, while regular players could still enjoy the game without feeling shoehorned to build particular deck with particular cards or suffer the consequences.

Instead I think that's something quite possible to do in this game, especially with the later expansions which got a lot of new stuff to the table and breathed life in old cards. But let's not talk too generically, gives us a theme/synergy you like, define better "the usual OP stuff" and some quests you find too difficult to beat. We shall make some decks and show you what can be done do againts them.

I stopped collecting and playing during the Dreamchasers era. My last box is Dreamchasers, and I don't think I've purchased any packs from that cycle. The last deck that I remember I've played was Arwen+Cirdan+Grima that the willpower part figure out on the table and specialized in cycling and resource acceleration to get heavy hitters out quickly. I remember Not being able to do much in any of the Dreamchaser quests with said deck.

Ok, so starting from this basic idea if I make, for theme/synergies purposes, a couple of Noldor/Dunedain decks (one more focused on questing/location control, the other for combat duties for example), submit it to you to see if it's not "too OP" and then play them through the Dreamchaser quests and report my games could you take it as an indicator of sort of the actual game difficulty?

I don't recall any particular Dundedain synergy going on, maybe a few powerful cost efficient allies.

Is it a yes or a no for the kind of deck? How about Arwen, Cirdan and LeAragorn as heroes for example? For a pure Noldor one I could go with Arwen Cirdan and Galdor.

Can you give me directly your deck list (if you still have it) so we avoid any further back and forth?

EDIT: btw what is the theme for a Cirdan Arwen Grima deck?

Anyway I was trying to prove that with some good deckbuilding and piloting skill you can pick almost any theme in the game and make a passable deck which will win a good ratio of the quest. Do you want me instead to take your deck (which might have some deckbuilding issues) and prove that I can (or possibly not) win even with it? Cause they are quite two different things and I don't see how the second one pertains to this topic.

I unfortunately don't have it any longer. I remember it having Fair and Perilous and Elven event that draw a card from the discard pile and returns to the hand. I think it also had the lute that returns card to hand after discarding it. Hope that helps. 

Well, the themes you were trying to pick weren't the one my deck was having, so if your point was to pick any theme at all - why would you ask for my deck? And if you wanted to pick my deck's theme, why would you want to play something different? I'm quite confused with what you're trying to achieve here, but tell you what. If you have time and interest, do one with my hero lineup, and one with the dunedain noldor theme you initially wanted.

I am trying to see if some practical test can get you to change your mind. You were lamenting how it's not possibile for someone to pick a theme and make a deck able to win a good portion of the quests. You were told that it could be a matter of good deckbuilding and piloting skill but you insisted that it was more about the game forcing you to play "the usual OP stuff" to succeed. What I am trying to accomplish here is take a theme you might like to see played (that's why I was asking about your deck), make myself a deck around that same deck and play it against some of the quest you deem difficult, to see where the "problem" actually lies.

Then what is the issue in taking my hero lineup? Like, you're free to include anything into the deck itself, including the stuff I physically don't own.

Because choosing a synergic trio of heroes is one of the key aspects of good deckbuilding and Grima is kinda the odd man out in that deck (both thematically and mechanically).

Is he dough? Handing out resource advantage for any color in exchange for threat while paired up with heroes from the sphere that deals most easily with the threat and kinda lacks any good resource acquisition tools is not atleast decent mechanical synergy to you? Combined with Arwen, it's 5 resources per turn with 0 setup, in a deck with no leadership whatsoever.

Sure you can make use of it, but I would still prefer to be able to have a Lore hero which I can target with Arwen's ability and not have to dedicate more deck space to counteract its threat rise. Moreover the Noldor theme has a few "play from the discard pile" effects which Grima cannot help with, also Galdor second ability would probably be of much more use in a Noldor deck which uses cards in hand as fuel than Grima Doomed discount. Still let's go with your choice.

Here is an example deck I made up on the spot, with cards up to the Dreamchaser cicle, would you think it's a good indicator to take and try out against some quests?

I have been out of it for a pretty long time, but I don't really predict success for this deck in those scenarios at the very least. But don't let that stop you.

Before a spend a couple of nights on this task some questions:

1) do you want a detailed run-up of every game or will you trust in my honesty in reporting the wins/losses?

2) If I manage to use this deck successfully will you take it as a sign that perhaps part of the problem might reside in your deck piloting skills?

3) Will the three quest from The Grey Havens box be enough or should I play the whole Dreamchaser cycle also?

Checking ringsdb, I see that lineup was used once already, by Drainu in the second solo league (October 2018).  His version of the deck has only 2 copies of Jubyar that was released after Dreamchaser (though Jubayr is admittedly awesome), and it does use 2 copies of U.C. and 3 copies of Test of Will and Galadhrim's Greetings.

Looking back at the results, the three quests were Voyage Across Beleagar (Deluxe), Flight of the Stormcaller (AP #1) and Temple of the Deceived (AP #3).    Drainu defeated all three quests on the first try -- that was good for sixth place that month, because six different players defeated all three quests on the first try and all used less cards outside a single Core + Dreamchaser cycle than he did.  Three players defeated all three quests on the first try using *only* cards from a single core + Dreamchaser cycle, and that month shows why the solo league has such a long list of tiebreakers!  I'll grant that these aren't the three hardest quests in the cycle (Raid on Grey Havens is probably the toughest for a solo deck), Temple in Deceived in particular should be routinely beatable if you take your time and aren't overly reliant on 1-hp allies.  But both Voyage and Stormcaller certainly have some challenge to them.  Still, in the solo league 6/9 defeated Voyage first try (2 of the other 3 used 1 token), 7/9 defeated Stormcaller first try (the other two used 1 token), and 8/8 defeated Temple of Decieved first try.

Grima/Cirdan/Arwen isn't a very thematic lineup, but my deck that month was A Stereotypical Non-Erestor Noldor deck.  My Stereotypical decks are created by analyzing the most common deck lineup for a particular archtype, and then the most commonly used cards with that lineup -- and having created those decks for a lot of stereotypical decks, I can tell you the most popular lineups are invariably thematic and the resulting deck is certainly not optimal!  It defeated all three quests, first try, and had not played the deck at all prior to the solo league (though I had played several of the heroes and many of the cards previously).

That's solo.  My son and I used my Dori, Side-Quests and LeEomer fellowship against GH/Dreamchaser, it defeated all quests but Raid and Storm over Cobas Haven on the first try, taking two or three tries (can't remember exactly) for those two.  We originally tried my Dori meets Spirit Pippin fellowship -- that didn't go nearly so well and we abandoned the attempt.

Solo league returned to Dreamchaser a couple times since then.

In July 2019 we took on Fate of Numenor, Raid on Grey Havens, and Temple of Deceived (again).  My deck was an ally-light experimental Elfhelm/Grimbeorn/SpMerry deck that was light on allies -- not exactly a top-tier deck.

3/4 players defeated Fate on first try (I was the lone exception and took one token -- Ruins of Ages Past did me in)

1/5 players defeated Raid on first try (the other four took 2-3 tokens)

3/4 players defeated Temple on first try (the exception took one token)

In December 2019 we returned again, playing Voyage again, Flight again, and Storm over Cobas Haven.  This time I used the Erestor version of the stereotypical Noldor deck.

2/4 defeated Voyage first try (the other two took 1 token, one was me)

3/4 defeated Stormcaller first try (I was the exception, and took 1 token)

1/4 defeated Cobas Haven first try (wasn't me).

A token is a card or resource used-pre game, Easy mode's extra resource per hero could be done with 3 tokens, but except for Raid and Cobas Haven virtually no one used more than one in any of the three leagues.

There's some brutal quests out there, but in my experience *most* non-POD quests are not.  I haven't played nightmare.

Some interesting thoughts here. Let me pitch in on the design aspect. I think you got some interesting subjects here. However, what you see as 'bad' design I see as design decisions with far reaching consequences.

1. Locations for multiplayer

This has been a point of discussion since the day of the core box I think. In multiplayer locations work differently then solo because in solo you can (eventually) get rid of all of them, while multiplayer requires questing over them. I'm not sure if this is nessecarily bad. In a way, this is the only way for the encounter deck to 'build up a board state'. But I don't play enough multiplayer to form a good opinion on this subject.

2. Doomed/ Encounter Card Design

Let's discuss the two mechanics eluded here: Heroes that scale with playercount and encounter cards that scale with player cards. I think there is enough room in this game for heroes that work best at certain player counts. Grima is obviously worse the more players you get. Thalin, Argalat, Faramir (lore), Merry (spirit) are examples of heroes that work much worse with less players. I think this is ok even if that means some heroes I will rarely if ever play with. And I think it's a thematic win that Grima can only trick so many people before they kick him out. I wouldn't put any of them in the Core set though (looking at you Thalin).

The other mechanics is encounter card scaling. Wether it's Doomed, Necromancers reach or the infamous Southeron Support there are a lot of cards that put the hurt on high player groups.

- But is it actually bad if quests don't scale well? Imagine a cycle with two quests. The first has a difficulty for solo players of 4/10 and the second 8/10. What if for multiplayer the first quests is 8/10 and the second 4/10. This means both quests don't scale well, but is this actually bad? You get the same difficulty over the entire cycle. Changing the player count may actually make the quests feel 'fresh' as you need to take completely different challenges into account. I would argue bad scaling isn't necessarily bad design.

- Is scaling on cards even necessary? Short answer: yes. The more players, the more sphere's on the table. Players are better able to make up for other player's weaknesses. If a player get's overwhelmed, the others can help him/her catch their breath for a while. Beregond can defend a tough enemy every round instead of just standing there if no enemy is revealed. If all encounter cards effected only 1 player (like most enemies) the players would quickly outpace the encounter deck.

- What about 'bad' scaling, aka Escape from Dol Guldur? Bad is subjective. EfDG is stupidly hard for solo. I don't play this scenario almost ever. And yet, I can't say it's bad by default. There are players out there who revel in the challenge of beating the unbeatable solo quest. There are players who tried specific decks to mitigate the effects. And these players are having fun with this quest existing. And for people with an one-deck-to-rule-them-all will probably like the idea that their deck cannot beat all quests (easily) and therefore could be improved upon with new cards on new releases. I think 'badly' scaled quests like EfDG has a very important place in the game and the game would be a lot poorer for a lot of people if this quest didn't exist. Like Thalin I wouldn't have put in in the Core set, but whatever.

Now I too, will sometimes be frustrated because I *know* that the quest that is beating me over and over again would be much easier with more players (King's quest most recently). It is a very emotional response actually and interesting to research. You probably feel the same when a quest clearly prefers one sphere over others.

4. Enemy Design

The underlying issue you raise here is that combat is to binairy: you block and live or you block and die. This is a consequence of Defense being relatively more important than HP. In the digital game, defense can be at best 1. There it's all about HP. In the physical game Beregond CAN defend for 4 from turn 1, so there have to be enemies that can overcome it or the game is going to be very stale for Beregond players. I feel like the current card pool has enough defense options. A more HP based approach would be interesting. Not sure if it would be better, but fun to think about indeed.

The rest of the points you make here are more about the game being to hard, which don't have much to do with the ebove mechanic so I won't comment on it here.

5. Bad starting conditions

You call it bad starting conditions, but the real mechanical principle here is power growth. In Magic/Hearthstone, both players increase their resource intake over time. This makes their power grow exponentially. Not only do you build your board state, but each turn you can play more (powerful) cards then the turn before. This works as an automatic come-back system for both players. If you have bad 1 cost cards, you can make up for it in turn 4 with a powerful 4 cost card. In LotR there is a linear resources system. You gain 3 resources every turn. This means that if you start losing, your board state will suffer and your disadventage starts snowballing or the other way around. This means: no automatic come back system. In fact, LotR has very few come back systems. The first few turns are absolutely essential.

I'm not sure if this is a case of 'could have done better'. Needless to say, an exponential resource version of this game would have been interesting. It also should have a way for the encounter deck to grow exponentially. I have thought about how this could work many times. It is no easy design change I can tell you! It definately wouldn't be the same game we now all know and love.

6. Insane difficulty on normal

Instead of talking about difficulty, which often ends in unpleasant discussions, I prefer talking about different people want different things from this game. Difficulty is one obvious thing. And I think we can all agree that multiple difficulty levels should have been part of the Core set design. But there is more. But often we, the players, have trouble imagining that things we don't like, actually exist for other players. For example you made a lot of really cool and interesting redesigns of old cards that where too weak to play in the modern cardpool. Your redesigns made all of them playable. Yet, for me, I WANT bad player cards. Or rather: I want cards that make me think "how can I build a deck that uses this card succesfully?". Bad cards are design challenges for me. And if I build a deck that makes such a cards work, I am really proud of it. If that card wasn't as bad initially, I wouldn't be so proud. And going a step further: the game also needs bad cards that don't work for the same reason. I see the design challenge, try it, and fail. But then I know why I failed and with every new card release I'm hoping for cards that can help me make that bad card work. It is a large part of the excitement of new cards for me. Palantir was such a card, I failed at building a deck with it, and every time a card comes out that might make it work, I get excited. Cards that are uninteresting to you, are fundamental to my enjoyment of the game. And the opposite is also true.

Whenever you think a card is badly designed, chances are they are perfectly designed for somebody else.

The above statement also holds true for difficulty. Escape from Mount Gram is NOT designed for me, and yet a lot of people enjoy it. I like bashing my head against Carn Dum over and over again with sub-par decks just to get that 1 in a 20 victory. I also like going through relatively easy quests with those same decks. Quests that require specific builds to get reasonable win rates are not really for me (I build mostly all-purpose decks) but as we see in this topic that is exactly how some other people play. It is a testament to the great design of this game that so many different approaches there are to this game. But that also means accepting that your personal approach isn't going to work every time. Sometimes a playercard or a quest just isn't designed for you.

I do however disagree that thematic cards are often bad. I find many thematic decks can work. I have a all-purpose Dúnedain Tactics-Leadership deck that works quite well even though you could argue that such a deck should NOT be played in solo. At the same time, I had to accept that the Dúnedain trap deck, just doesn't work with sailing quests. But the fun I had with other decks against those quests made up for it.

Fate of Numeror is also done (won at the firs try), even though it was a grueling 12 turns. But we all know that the real hard one is coming (Raid on the Grey Havens).

I'm sorry, you're gonna play each scenario only once? That's hardly has a legit statistical sample. I once beat nightmare anduin solo on my first try because I had the mildest encounter draw possible. Thats not saying much.

I am definitely not doing like back to back play of the same quest when I win to avoid boring myself with the same stuff over and over. I might go over Raid on the Grey Havens a few times before beating it the first time so that's different.

I was thinking to start with how many tries do I need to get to three victories for each quest, would that be a good statistical sample?

One thing that would have been nice for this game is if they designed better ways for the player to come back when things go wrong. As has been pointed out in another thread, an early (unplanned) death of a hero usually heralds a loss. I think many players scoop at that point or soon after, thinking, what's the point? On the other hand, I do think the designers have done a good job (and better over time) of allowing the encounter deck to make a comeback from a dominant player board position. That's one of the best aspects of this game, and what keeps it interesting. But the lack of good ways for players to claw back from the brink of destruction is, in my mind, a bit unfortunate. Contrast, for example, to Journeys in Middle Earth, which has a "last stand" mechanic built-in and always active: if a hero is about to die, the player gets an automatic chance to save the hero (it gets progressively less likely the more deaths of the hero). There is no comparable mechanic in LotR LCG.

I love this game, I understand it has to be difficult to allow for a player to look through the encounter deck and then build his own optimal deck to beat it. Even then generally the quests kick ***. However, I do sometimes think that the designers create a thematic encounter deck and then just increase it's power levels and have everything combo perfectly.

 I'm not the best tactician, strategist or deck builder. I often grab decks from Rings DB. But it generally takes me over a month of regular repeated plays constantly tweaking or changing decks, seeking advice and help to be able to beat a quest on normal mode with no mistakes. Even switching to easy mode usually is no easier as 1 of each card is taken out making the ratios the same and often leaves in some of the really nasty side quests that now have more chance of coming up. 

In my experience watching you tube playthroughs where someone claims they beat such a such quest usually are not perfect games. Mistakes are made, multiple mulligan are made to get the perfect starting hand and scoops and restarts happen and edited out so that the episode you see is the one where it worked (kind of- mistakes happen after all the game is very fiddly in places)

So my point is the original poster has a point... it stops being fun on the 30th play through of a quest... it becomes like a cross word you just cant do... it becomes really irritating. 

I'm currently stuck on the city of Ulfast, and I've tried all sorts of decks and tweaks, 2 handed solo, one handed. Contacts, etc. The number of times I've had to scoop because I've either made a mistake or forgotton a trigger or lost a hero early etc are too numerous to count. 

Even the one deck to rule them all (on rings db) often fails to win quests for me

 

So can someone please create a deck dedicated or thematic and play through City of Ulfast true solo without making a mistake on normal mode paying attention to the FAQ and the rules as written. (For example dealing a shadow card for every attack even additional and immediate attacks - some people don't do that due to earlier versions of the FAQ)

Do that, post a write up turn by turn, and a deck list and I'll be very grateful 😊

This is a bit of a digression, but the idea of how many trials are necessary to characterize the performance of a particular deck against a particular quest (assuming player skill is constant in trials) has long interested me, though I remember enough statistics to think the answer is "way more than is practical to do it routinely".  For practical reasons I thought that play to 3 wins or 3 losses (so 3-5 trials) would be good enough for guesstimating, though I think the 90% confidence interval for the "true" winning percentage would still be extremely large.  (No, I haven't done the actual math, my old college stats book is packed and I was unable to find a handy online calculator that would do all the work for me.)

Any number of trials to three wins would be a different distribution, could be 3-0, could be 3-300 against Escape From Dol Goldur.  But the tendency to play to X wins rather than X number of tries is common, I think (for me, generally X is 1).  The end result is that my winning percentage against LOTR across all my plays is considerably lower than the average of my winning percentages among all quests.  For instance, the first time I played through Against the Shadow cycle, I played Encounter at Amon Din just twice (2-0, once with each deck I was using), and Morgul Vale 27 times (1-26).  My overall winning percentage in the cycle was lower than my winning percentage against 8 of 9 quests.

Anyways, in three trials here's the chance that a deck with a given true percentage would go 3-0:

True 0%, 0%

True 10%, 0.1%

True 20%, 0.8%

True 30%, 2.7%

True 40%, 6.4%

True 50%, 12.5%

True 60%, 21.6%

True 70%, 34.3%

True 80%, 51.2%

True 90%, 72.9%

True 100%, 100%

Using 5% as a "rare event" threshold, three successful trials can't statistically distinguish between a 100% true win rate and a 37% true win rate, and an 80% deck is more likely than not to go 3-0 over three trials.

No real point, I just find that stuff interesting :).

This is one situation where I really like Seastan's Grace of the Valar variant that we use in the solo league.  By continually increasing the help I get as I lose, I don't have to play an unreasonable number of times to beat the quest and I know eventually I will overcome it.  It lets me beat quests with decks that couldn't really beat the quest without an excessive number of tries, even on easy mode.

(Note -- except Escape From Mount Gram, where the tokens do diddly squat when everything you need is captured).

At least from a frequentist perspective, the Wilson score interval [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_proportion_confidence_interval#Wilson_score_interval] is a good way of estimating the true win % for a given set of circumstances given a number of sample trials (say, 3 wins in 5 tries). There is an online calculator here:

https://epitools.ausvet.com.au/ciproportion [https://epitools.ausvet.com.au/ciproportion]

As you mention, one would generally need to play more games than is really practical in order to get the confidence interval down to a "small" range. Of course, one can start bringing in some aspects of human judgement to help assist (perhaps codifiable in a Bayesian framework of some kind). And the assumption of independence of trials is essentially violated if one is counting every trial from, say, playing a quest from a blind start. But in terms of a pure traditional statistics approach, the above calculator is adequate.

After 17 turns that felt like an eternity also the first game against Raid on the Grey Havens ended in victory (for all those interested I kept a turn-by-turn playthrough). The deck could definitely be tweaked to be improved (especially with some of the events that play on other copies in the discard pile), but it's still quite playable. In the next days I will start the trio of quests again

Couple of questions.

How did you handle fight with the deck you've shown? There is not a lot, if any, fight related stuff in it, and raid on the havens is a very fight heavy quest if memory serves me well. I was often overwhelmed on initial turns. Yet you have almost no fight in the deck and somehow win.

Correct me if I wrong, but you don't have a way to play Sword-elf that is in your deck?

Yeah it's definitely light on the combat side, but Narya helps a lot for that. Stand and Fight to play the Veteran, Guardian of Rivendell for defense and possibly attack (with Narya boost they have 4 Defense and 3 Attack), using lots of characters and chump blocking where needed, Glorfindel is always good of course. But yes it took me 9 rounds to get rid of Na'asiyah and Sahir so definitely not an easy job. If you want to read the playthrough I can send it to you. I also kept a couple of Raid Leaders in the staging area for a good part of the quest.

Say aren't you the guy who made a "solemn promise" that if they released a Saruman hero you would buy every pack up to the pack with him in it?

Did I? I was planning buying just the Saruman pack, and maybe Smeagol and Nya'shish ones. Regardless, my financial situation doesn't allow me to make such gargantuan purchases of something I'm not going to play.

I got curious about exactly what distribution this would be, as well as how to calculate a confidence interval around it. It turns out it's described by a negative binomial distribution, and based on this paper [http://faculty.washington.edu/fscholz/Reports/poissonconfbd5.pdf] (pp. 7–9), it looks like you can use a beta distribution to calculate a CI around the parameter corresponding to your win rate.

For example, say you predetermine your desired number of wins to be 3. When you run the "experiment", it takes you 8 tries to get to 3 wins. The naive point estimate of your true win rate is, of course, 3/8=0.375. If I did my math right, then the 90% CI ≈ [.11 [https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Quantile%5BBetaDistribution%5B3%2C6%5D%2C+.05%5D], .66 [https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Quantile%5BBetaDistribution%5B3%2C5%5D%2C+.95%5D]].

(Interestingly, under the above conditions, the minimum variance unbiased estimator value [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2332299] for your win rate is not 3/8, but 2/7≈.286… It goes to show you that how you reach a 3 out of 8 ratio is crucial information—you didn't preset that you would play 8 times and count how many wins you'd get in those plays, you instead said you would play until you hit 3 wins, and the # of games happened to be 8. Note that a Bayesian statistician probably would disagree with this entire discussion, lol.)

Cool, 

I'm going to put your deck together and go up against City Of Ulfast and that nasty turn 1/2 9 attack city 

With 62 cards in the deck I have my reservations for resource gen and card draw in getting key cards out ( even with Grima and Cirdain) 

I'll have some fun trying it and let you know how I get on but I'm thinking this deck won't even scratch city of ulfast on paper. 

I hope I'm wrong. 😀

So, I've built the deck. Actually had a good feeling about this when constructing the deck and seeing each card and it's synergy with the Noldor theme. 

I'll try and get it played tonight but it might be tomorrow now before I can give it a proper whirl.

Well it's a sub-optimal deck I put together just for a proof of concept for John Constantine, not a strong deck (let alone an optimized one). But still between Cirdan and Elven Light it cycles fast (Cirdan decks often go over the usual 50 cards limit) and in my three games with it I often ended up having gone through like 2/3 of it. The resource cost (Gildor and Glorfindel aside) is also quite low and I didn't face too much resource problems (but Grima's Doomed should be used sparingly).

If you want to go against City of Ulfast (one of the hardest quest ever in my opinion) I feel this deck will fall short, unless you try to rework it. For example get rid of Grima and put in Galdor or Erestor and go even more strongly for the discard theme (To The Sea, To The Sea will be a must) and change a little the allies and attachment selection.

I actually had quite a bit of success against City of Ulfast with a Forth The Three Hunters deck with Arwen, Elladan and Elrohir (Elladan with Inner Strenght, Ancestral Armor and Elven Mail can actually withstand some City Guard attacks) if you want to keep the Noldor theme.

Start of game. 

Opening hand:

Sailor of Lune

Light of Valinor

Guardian of Rivendell

Silver Harp 

Veteran Sword-Elf

A Test of Will

 

I decide to keep this hand- no mulligan

Set up- added Crowded Market to the staging area.

Turn1:  drew elwings flight and imladris caregiver. Discarded the flight. 

Played silver Harp on cirdan. Used arwen to discard veteran sword elf and give her a resource. Silver harp puts veteran sword elf back into my hand. Played light of valinor on cirdan, grima discounts it. 

Quest 9 wp. Draws servant of sauron who engages me. Surge... catacombs 4 threat.

9 wp vs 7 threat. 2 progress on quest. 

Combat: cirdan defends shadow (ulchors agent) +1 attack. 1 damage on cirdan. 

Refresh

Threat increases by 1- servant of Mordor makes immediate attack. Grima defends... shadow (extra vigil, does nothing). No damage but grima exhausted.

1 resource on the quest.

End of turn (threat is 32)

 

Turn 2

Draws stand and fight and healing herbs. Discards healing herbs, silver Harp puts it back in my hand. 

Arwen discards veteran sword elf to gain a resource

(Servant of Mordor has shut down grima discount action)

Play sailor of Lune for 2 play guardian of Rivendell for 3, discarding healing herbs first then stand and fight.

Quest 9 wp (Cirdain, arwen, sailor)

Stage: Cat and Mouse side quest (city guard now engagement 30)

9wp vs 8 threat -1 progress on quest (total 3 of 5)

Travel to crowded market. Travel effect 'adds'  messenger from Mordor to the staging area. (Reveal effect doesn't trigger)

City guards engagement is now 50

Combat. guardian of Rivendell defends shadow (servant of mordor) has no effect.

Cirdan attacks- 1 damage on servant of Mordor

Refresh: threat 33 servant makes an immediate attack, guardian of Rivendell defends. Shadow (side street) no effect

1 resource on quest. City guard now engagement 45

 

Turn 3

Draws lembas and the Galadhrims greeting. Discard lembas but silver Harp saves it.

Plays lembas on Cirdain  grima pays for it. He has no resources left now. 

(Saving the greeting till the end of questing in case I need test of will paying for. )

Questing all in for 11 ( except guardian who is already exhausted)

Stages ulchors agent (3 threat and reveal effect to raise my threat by 3 to 36)

Plays a test of will to cancel the threat increase when revealed effect

12 threat vs 11 wp. Threat increases by 1 to 34. Servant of sauron makes an immediate attack. 

Cirdan defends. Shadow (we've been seen) gives +1. Cirdain takes 1 damage.

Discards lembas to fully heal and ready Cirdain.

Arwen discards imladris caregiver to gain a resource (harp already exhausted so no save)

Plays Galadhrims greeting. Threat now 28. Also no cards left in hand)

Combat: Cirdain defends . Shadow (extra vigil) does nothing. No damage. 

Refresh. Threat 29 servant makes an immediate attack.  Guardian of Rivendell defends. Shadow (catacombs) does nothing.

1 resource added to stage 1 (3 now) city guard engagement is 40

Turn 4

Each hero now has 1 resource each.

Draws elronds council and elven jeweler.  Discards jeweler but silver Harp saves. 

Plays elven jeweler. 

[At this point I'm feeling grima is locked out, I'm not drawing enough cards, arwen isn't getting used as the harp is saving the card from cirdain and I need more resources and will power for questing.  ]

Saving the jeweler as chump I quest all in again without guardian for 11wp. (Greeting is on top of discard) and playing council to add 1 wp and reduce threat to 26

Stages guarded archway 2 threat (if engaged with city guard threat cannot be reduced)

12 quest vs 15 threat (game over? Quest will spiral out of control now). 

Threat increases to 29, servant of Mordor makes an immediate attack. Cirdain defends. Shadow (crowded market) no effect

Cant engage either of the two staged enemies as they have attack 3 and 4 so will auto kill a hero. [Unless I risk ulchors agent not to get a +1 shadow and go undefended against cirdan. However, With servant attacking three times a round I can't risk it]

Combat: elven jeweler chumps servant of Mordor. Shadow (patrolling the streets) gives +1 for each resource on main quest- so +3 then. 5 damage to poor jeweler. She's destroyed.

Refresh: threat increases to 30. Servant makes an immediate attack. Guardian of Rivendell defends. Shadow (under guard) has no effect in this instance. 

1 resource on stage 1 (now 4) makes city guard 5 threat and 35 engagement.

Turn 5

Draws sailor of Lune and guardian of Rivendell (which I cant play as have no other cards in my hand) discards guardian but have to save it with Harp to keep an event on top of the discard) plays sailor.

Quest all in for 13 wp.

Stages patrolling the streets (places 1 resource on stage 1 making 5 there now. I choose the restriction on putting progress on the quest as that ain't happening anyway)

13 quest vs 17 threat. Threat goes up 4 and servant makes an immediate attack. cirdain defends. Shadow (messenger from mordor) +1 attack. Cirdain takes 1 damage 

Engagement. 

Messenger from Mordor, ulchors agent and city guard all engage 

 

Scoop.

All heroes exhausted, 1 card in my hand (guardian of Rivendell) only 2 resources left (lore) only 3 progress of 5 made on stage 1 and threat 34. facing 4 undefended attacks (3; 2; 4; 9)

Here I would have discarded the Healing Herbs in the Resource Phase and used the Harp to keep Stand and Fight in the Planning Phase for next turn.

Not surprised (Grima is a really bad fit for this quest), but perhaps you could have risked it a bit more with some undefended attack from the Servant to kill it.

Why not? No active location so you needed to chose the immediate attack option.

Due to some bad luck in the first rounds my second run against Voyage Across Belegaer was much harder and it took me 6 turns to finally get a foothold against the encounter deck and start fighting seriously back. I was still able to squeeze out a win by turn 10.

Once again Guardian of Rivendell, Veteran and Narya (also I engaged only Scouting Ships, so 1 Corsair each, leaving the others I got in the staging area). If you want to read the details I can send you the playthrough of the games.

I would say making assessment like "it's impossible to build a random thematic deck that would be quite successful at beating a good portion of the game" is quite unfair considering the whole cardpool (still extending, not for long, but still), especially if you don't actually own the whole cardpool. But I'm somehow not too surprised here.

Now if the "what could have been better" assessment was "it took too long to be able to build a random thematic deck that would be quite successful at beating a good portion of the game" then I would tend to agree. That's probably why the release model (like Marvel with pre-constructed ready-to-play decks) or building model (Arkham limited to 30 cards roughly with 2 cards per title and only 2 scenarios per deluxe allowing for a quicker growth of the player cardpool) has changed.

Finished the 2nd and 3rd runs of The Fate of Numenor, both wins even though the 3rd one was a 16 turns slugfest where I ended up emptying my deck in the last couple of rounds (which I guess got in hand against most of the "discard the bottom card" effects).

Now onward to another couple of ***-whopping from Raid on the Grey Havens

The number one thing that could make this game better is having Angus McBride art. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

I don't really see any problems with the OP's issues.  An adventuring party moving to single locations as a group works thematically and avoids the additional abstraction of engaging enemies from the same pool while being at different locations. Doom... the whole of middle earth feels the encroaching shadow regardless of whether the three hunters, the dwarves of Erebor, or the ring-bearers held the first player token during the War of the Ring. The rest of the issues never struck me as bad design on the encounter/enemy side, but more of a resource issue on the side of the players.

Granted, I only originally played through the first two cycles, but I never liked how it sometimes felt that the next pack would really help solve the current pack's difficulties. I was mostly a solo player.  Still, my biggest problems were always resource and deck related. 50 cards felt like too large a deck at the time, and the resource match rules seemed too draconian.  Maybe it's easier to deal with now, or maybe I was always trash at the game.  (No one can tell me single player mono faction Tactics decks are viable, at least not in the early days)

I think the game would be well served by a 2nd edition, drawing upon some of the strengths of AHLCG in terms of product release, deckbuilding, and resource management.. and the RPG elements.  And fix the Icon Songs. No way should it cost a resource to get an additional icon while using deck slots and getting punched in the face by encounters.

White the 2nd run against Raid on the Grey Havens was a quite defeat (also due to a couple of strategic mistakes on my part) the 3rd run gave me of the most exciting and tight wins of my career with this game. An intense and breath-taking 19 turns which left my deck basically empty and my spirit elated for such an hard won victory (with definitely some luck on my part)

I will leave the playthrough below for those interested (and let's hope I have not made some mistakes):
