Hi everyone

 

I've been playing Road Darkens again, and a rules question came up - what happens when a burden (e.g. grievous wound) gets attached to a character, then gets discarded by, say, Miner of the Iron Hills (because it now counts as a condition attachment.

 

Does the burden go back into 1. the staging area (unlikely, becasue then it isn't being discarded!), 2. the discard pile, or 3. leaves the game?

 

If 2, what happens if the burden gets revealed?  Does it basically go back into the staging area?

Discard pile, and if you reveal it again you simply add it to the staging area as you would any other cad.  Then if the trigger goes off (like getting damaged), you'll reattach it to a hero.
