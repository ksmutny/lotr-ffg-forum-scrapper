So I always do the LotR GenCon event every year, but this year looks to be quite different. Normally Ill build a deck for me and my buddy to tackle the scenario, however this year it is up to 12 players in one scenario!! That just sounds incredible. So, I just wanna see if anyone else in the forums is doing it and how you are building your deck. Do you build a couple to cover the group? Like a tank build, or a heavy quester build, or a straight killer deck, or try to be as well balanced as you can?

The siege of Annu sounds really exciting.

well, I'll be there.   My plan is I think to bring a few decks, with a variety of uses.   One heavy combat, one heavy questing, and one that is about equal parts.  I'm trying to stay away from characters who I expect will be showing up all over the place, but I'm hoping that between three decks I will have one with no conflict with other players,  since I am unfortunately down a partner and am going to have to join somebody else's team.

You know? Every year I think, "I'll avoid decks with popular characters so I can fit in anywhere."  Guess what?  No one showed up with the characters I was avoiding, and I got stuck playing a boring crappy deck.

 

This year I'm bringing decks that are fun to play.

You can totally make fun decks without the most popular characters!

Just run the rings of power deck and include Steward and Horn so you can snag everything before your opponents, i mean teammates, can get them played.

See, the trick is to bring a Spirit Pippen, Lore Bilbo, and Fatty Bolger deck.

Watch as everyone brings obscure heroes and nobody brings Eowyn or Aragorn.

90% sure that Tactics Eowyn is going to show up at every table.

(if Flame of the West is indeed a GenCon release)
