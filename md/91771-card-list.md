# [Card list](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/91771-card-list/)

## 1 [Phrog on October 9, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/91771-card-list/?do=findComment&comment=884789)

Does anyone know where I could fina a completelist of all the cards and quantity of every set out. I'm also looking for the set icons to make a list of what cards go to which deck.

I've looked everywhere on forums, BBG I'm needing a full card list.

Can anyone help me?

Thanks in advance
