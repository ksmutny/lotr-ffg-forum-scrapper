If a player plays message from elrond and passes over a card, what happens that round if the player who passed the card gets eliminated? Is the card removed from the game? If so, that is a pretty sad result. Allies and attachments cannot remain in play with this card effect then and thus you cannot make a "before I'm eliminated" pass.

I got a ruling from Caleb once about the Forced effect on a Curious Brandybuck that triggered after its owner had been eliminated, but was under another player's control. The answer was, the Brandybuck is removed from the game. Message from Elrond has similar enough wording that it should be the same with its card.

Man. That is so disappointing. The only card that makes sense to pass is an event or a leaves play card anyway (Gandalf, elrond, etc)

Defender of the West is an amusing option (needs more than 2 players to be relevant in this situation, admittedly).

Seastan did wonders with Stand and Fight and Message from Elrond combining up to create the ultimate Outlands army in a 4 player game and last 99 rounds or so against The Black Gate Opens.

Even for events it would be handy to get around the 3x limitation on event cards.  Extra copies of Gwaihir's Debt would be pretty useful, for example.  Being able to play Evening Star or Skyward Volley with three copies in your discard already would also be pretty cool.
