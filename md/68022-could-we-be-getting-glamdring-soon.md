 I was mentally building my deck for Shadow and Flame last night and realized that it was Glamdring that Gandalf used to put the beatdown on the Balrog.  We know that Orcrist is coming in The Hobbit saga, but could we be getting Glamdring in the next expansion pack?  It was pointed out on BGG that we didn't see any new Tactics cards in the third teaser.  If so, what would its ability be?

Now, I believe we aren't really suppose to beat the Balrog in this expansion, but rather escape it during the last quest stage while it attacks us from the staging area.  So that kind of flies in the face of us getting Beater in the first place.

glamdring….mmm….im not sure….along with sting it glowed blue when enemies are near so it should have something to do with that, sort of allowing you to peek at the encounter deck and if its an enemy put it to the bottom

In the next Adventure pack no, but FFG made it sound pretty obvious that we will be getting it in the Hobbit box.

The one article talking about the Hobbit box said  "The Hobbit also introduces five unique cards specifically designed for the expansion’s scenarios. These include Bilbo Baggins (The Hobbit: Over Hill and Under Hill, 1), an event with the Baggins sphere of influence, and the new treasure cards."

So the 5 unique cards will be:

1. Bilbo

2. Burglar Baggins event card

3. Orcrist

4. Another Treasure

5. Another Treasure

I can think of two very special and specific treasure items that were found right alongside Orcrist: Glamdring and Sting. ^_^ [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_happy.png]

 

So that'd be my guess. In the Hobbit box.

so does that mean we wont be able to use it outside of the hobbit box, it being a treasure card?

That I'm not so sure on. Personally I'm hoping that the treasure cards and rules are something that can be added to every quest, not just the Hobbit ones, as they sound like they will add good continuity and reason to playing multiple quests in a row. Would be a shame if that was then limited to only the 3 Hobbit box quests. But we'll have to wait and see.

i agree- i like the idea of treasure cards, im not sure how it would work mind you….but if it could be included somehow into standard quests then that would be great

 Wasn't there an image of a card floating around that was spoiled some months ago of a guy with his back to the wall in a cave with a glowing sword?  I think it came from some international advertisement and I don't believe we've seen the card.

I think so.  Not a Glamdring card I don't believe, but the sword was glowing.  I can't find it though.

 Hmmm…. I remembered something else, but maybe that's it.  Obviously that's in The Hobbit expansion.

Sting was spoiled a while ago has another one of the three treasure in another thread from a french article (with the new Gandalf, remember ??)  meaning it will surely be glamdring which will be the third treasure.
