each player must exhaust a character and discard the top card of his deck, if able.  if the printed cost of the discarded card is equal to or higher than the remaining hit points of the exhausted chatacter, discard the exhausted character.                               If my deck is depleted, I just exhaust a character and nothing happens, correct?

yeah.  "if able."  If you aren't able, you get a freebie!
