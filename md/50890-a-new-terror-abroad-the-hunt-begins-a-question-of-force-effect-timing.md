The Hunt Begins - When the Forced effect of this card is triggered, are the Characters that quested still considered "commited" to the Quest?

I would say yes, since I believe we are still in the Quest Phase of the game... we have certainly not started the Travel Phase, and unless there is some "blind spot" in between these Phases we have to still be in the Quest Phase. And if I read the Rules correctly the question Characters are considered Commited until the end of the Quest Phase.

Correct?

A New Terror Abroad - Does this Forced Effect take place before any characters can "commit" to the Quest?

I think it does, but at the same time the Questing Phase starts with Characters committing... so there is a small chance the timing can be chosen as per the FAQ (1.02) Simultaneous Effect Timing.

Any ideas?

 I consider characters committed to the quest until the travel phase begins.

I also have the forced effect take place before committing to questing on A New Terror.  I go with the argument that committing to a quest doesn't trigger the start of the questing phase, it's just the first thing you do unless there is some kind of response that happens at the beginning of the questing phase.

So we have the same take on this. Good. Then my assumptions can't be too far out. :-)

Does the effect of "A New Terror Abroad" take place every turn or only once when I reach that quest phase?
