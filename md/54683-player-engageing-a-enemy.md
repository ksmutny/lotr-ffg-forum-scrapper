Hey I was playing a game/reading learning the rules and I was wondering if I engage a monster does it attack me first then I attack or do Ijust jump to resolveing my attack(s).

 Not exactly.  Each player chooses whether to engage one enemy.  Then enemies will engage players.  Then all engaged enemies will attack.  Then all players will attack.
