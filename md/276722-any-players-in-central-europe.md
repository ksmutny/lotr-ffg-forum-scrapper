Mrs. Beorn and I will be in Central Europe (Hungary, Czech Republic, Austria) this fall, ending up in Munich for Oktoberfest. Any players out there interested in joining us for a beer, coffee, or game? Message me if youâ€™d like to meet up somewhere along our travels.

Best to ask this in the German Facebook group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/888603221191804/

Thanks for the suggestion, @Nerdmeetsyou [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/247702-nerdmeetsyou/]. I don't use Facebook, so unfortunately I won't be able to post in that group.
