Does 'Elf-Stone' require one of your Hero's to match the sphere of the Ally that you are putting into play? 

 

The text says:

"Attach to the active location. Attached location gets +1 quest point. 

Response: After attached location leaves play as an explored location, the first player puts 1 ally into play from his hand." 

 

I'm assuming that is doesn't require a match and for example; Damrod could be put into play from a Mono Lore deck.

No match needed!  Since you aren't paying for it, there's no resource match check.
