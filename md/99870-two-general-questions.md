1. Do enemies exhaust to attack? I ask this because in the Road to Rivendell scenario, some enemies with ambush attack you immediately when they engage with ambush. Does that mean they attack AGAIN during the normal combat phase? or does the first ambush attack mean they can't attack again on the same turn?

 

2. In a 2 player game, if one player dies, and the other remains alive and continues playing, how many cards are revealed from the encounter deck during the questing phase? is it still 2 cards - one per player who started the game, or just 1 card - not counting the player that died anymore?

 

Thanks for the help!

1. No.. they will attack again

 

2. Technically 2 are still revealed but many people reduce the reveals. I would just fold and start again if my partner died

This is incorrect. Page 22 of the rulebook:

"Note that after a player is eliminated, one less card is 

revealed from the encounter deck during the staging 
step of the quest phase, as there is now one less player 
involved in the game."
 
As a result, player elimination is by no means fatal - I've notched a few wins 2P where one has been eliminated.
 
However, if the player is eliminated during staging, you don't reduce the number of cards to be revealed in THAT round - FAQ:
"The base number of cards to be revealed is 
determined at the beginning of the staging step, and 
does not change if a player is eliminated during 
staging."
