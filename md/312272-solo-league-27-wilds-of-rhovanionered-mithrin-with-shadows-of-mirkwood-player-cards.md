## 1 [Alonewolf87 on November 1, 2020](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/312272-solo-league-27-wilds-of-rhovanionered-mithrin-with-shadows-of-mirkwood-player-cards/?do=findComment&comment=4009074)

Welcome to the LOTR Solo League. This month we'll be playing three quests from The Wilds of Rhovanion box and the Ered Mithrin cycle. The quests are:

1) Journey Up the Anduin
2) Fire in the Night
3) The Fate of Wilderland

Here are the rules:

1) Each player will construct a 50+ card deck, then use that exact deck against all three quests. You may use that deck freely against any quests (include the three quests in the league) prior to the run for testing purposes, but you may not use any trial runs for your official results.

2) At least one of the heroes must be from a box with those quests. This means that you must have at least one of Brand Son Bain, Bard Son of Brand, Thranduil, Radagast.

3) Your score against each quest will be how much help you need to defeat it, based on the Grace of the Valar variant invented by Seastan. It works like this:

For each token you have, you can choose to draw a card or give a hero a resource. This happens one at a time, so if I use my first token to draw a card, I see the card before I decide whether to use my second token for a card or a resource. This can be done *anytime* during setup.

The original variant starts at zero tokens and gains two tokens if you lose quickly (first five turns) and one if you do not -- however, for the purposes of this league I will allow you to start a quest at any number of tokens, and adjust by as many as you want. The only rules for adding/reducing tokens are these:

Rule 1) If you lose a quest with X tokens, you cannot play that quest again with X or less tokens.
Rule 2) If you defeat a quest with Y tokens, you cannot play that quest again with Y or more tokens.

So for example, if I start with six tokens against Into the Pit and defeat it, I can play it again with 0-5 tokens. If I then try with three tokens and lose, I can play it again with 4 or 5 tokens. If I try with four and lose, I can play it again with 5 tokens. If I win, my final score for that quest is 5, and if I lose my final score for the quest is 6. (Alternatively, I could've decided that 6 was a good enough score the first time I played it, and just have my final score be 6 without playing again.)

Remember that tokens do not carry over between quests. When playing Foundations of Stone it does not matter how many tokens I needed to defeat Road to Rivendell.

4) You are not required to publish your deck, but providing a ringsdb link is encouraged (otherwise I may need to ask you for your decklist at the end of the month if required for a tiebreaker). You are required to reveal which Heroes you used, and how many cards in your deck came from outside The Lost Realm/Angmar Awakened, SoH/Haradrim and a single core. Do not include outside heroes in this count, only cards in the deck itself.

Note: Contracts (from the most recent cycle) are not part of the deck and should not be counted. A Loot Deck (from the Burglar's turn contract) is also not part of the deck and should not be counted. The One Ring or the Messenger of the King ally/hero should also not be counted *unless* your deck uses those cards to reach 50 -- the Master card fetched by the One Ring should be counted. You may follow contract/One Ring setup instructions at the same as hero setup, ignoring Caleb's ruling.

5) Tiebreakers have frequently mattered in this league. Here are the tiebreakers, in order:
---
1st) The number of outside cards (i.e. not from The Wilds of Rhovanion/Ered Mithrin, Shadows of Mirkwood or a single core) used in the deck. Do not count outside heroes in this count, only cards in the deck. Less cards is better.

2nd) The number of heroes specifically from The Wilds of Rhovanion/Ered Mithrin and Shadows of Mirkwood. More is better.

3rd) The number of heroes used from this list: Brand Son Bain, Bard Son of Brand, Thranduil, Radagast. More is better.

4th) The number of cards in the deck outside The Wilds of Rhovanion/Ered Mithrin and Shadows of Mirkwood. Less is better, and core cards are considered "outside" for this tiebreaker.

5th) The number of cards outside Journey Up the Anduin, Fire in the Night, and The Fate of Wilderland. Less is better, and core cards are considered "outside" for this tiebreaker.

6th) Performance in October's Solo League (if you didn't play or finish September's League, a median performance will be assumed). Whoever did worst wins this tiebreaker.
---

6) 1st place gets to choose the cycle for January's league, 2nd place gets to choose a quest from that cycle, and 3rd place gets to choose a quest *not* to be used from that cycle. In an effort to expand the diversity of decks used, the last place player will choose an additional cycle that may be used for deckbuilding in January's league.

7) Weekly deadlines will at 11:59pm Eastern on the 14th, 21st, and 28th. Only the final deadline really matters for scoring and cannot be extended -- the first two deadlines are only to be included in intermediate standings.

Journey Up the Anduin: November 14th
Fire in the Night: November 21st
The Fate of Wilderland: November 28th

8 ) I've created a google spreadsheet for results here:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iZeehdX7jYtDpUmzpsY1TWAY_SGhR8XN6wugqogInx0/edit#gid=0 [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iZeehdX7jYtDpUmzpsY1TWAY_SGhR8XN6wugqogInx0/edit#gid=0]

To join the league, merely add your name and information about your deck to the spreadsheet, then enter your results as you have them. Please give a link to your deck if you built or published it on ringsdb, but it is not required.

If you wish you may run additional decks against the quests and record your results, but only the first entry will be considered for the competition itself.

Thanks for posting this up! Only thing is I think you need to change the first paragraph in the post as it’s referring to last month. I’m looking forward to flying my Eagles against the dragons here.

I will go with a Dale deck, making the Guardian of Esgaroth the center piece of the deck (though this might make Fire in the Night a bit hard since I will start without a strong defender). I could have gone for the Spirit Beregond route, but I wanted to have all Dale heroes.

Going to jump in this one with an Eagles deck! We'll see how it goes!

As Eagles are one of my favorite builds I had one readily available to run and with only 6 cards out of the cycles allotted. Here is the link:

Journey up the Anduin

I drew the location that made me count my number of characters and had to work around that initially. But thankfully I had Radagast’s Staff in my starting hand along with a shape changer and a giant bear and so I was able to get a strong force out fairly quickly. Threat finished at 42 and it went pretty smoothly with pumped up Eagles of the Misty Mountains being able to defend against and then devour both Trolls I encountered.

The Radagast Eagles decks I have been playing have used either TEowyn or Hirgon, and thus had some decent questing. But since I only used in-cycle cards... well, let's just say that when I was building this deck I kind of forgot that the quest phase exists... Journey Up the Anduin finally came out in a victory at 12 tokens. On to face the Dragon! Y'all can thank me for guaranteeing none of you will be last place!

Also, @General_Grievous [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/183728-general_grievous/] I believe you have 7 out of cycle cards. 1 Legolas, 3 Emissary, 3 Wilyador. Not that it matters much. 😉

Thanks Bobby appreciate the second check! I wasn’t sure how to record him I was just going off of rule 4 and so didn’t mention him as one of the cards:

”The One Ring or the Messenger of the King ally/hero should also not be counted *unless* your deck uses those cards to reach 50”

My intention in creating that rule was to exclude MotK-heroes as being part of the deck, unless they were used to reduce the effective deck size below 50.  This followed from my opinon that the setup contract ruling is obviously contrary to their design, and a MotK-hero should be chosen and placed before the deck is ever shuffled.

This is the way hahaha. But that’s what I went for, added in the extra card to keep it legit for the rings DB but I started with him as the hero. 
 

Also my first attempt at Fire in the Night was not successful. Lasted a decent while but in the end I just couldn’t generate the questing power to clear side quests and there was too much dragon fire. Time to take a token.

Fire in the Night redux went better, but not by much. Such a long bloody close game, thankfully a super-powered Eagles of the Misty Mountains was able to hold off any and all attacks (except when allies couldn’t defend or characters didn’t count defense!! Such a hard quest!) but I managed to hold off and pass questing by having all three Eagles of the Misty Mountains, all three eagles of the north and Meneldor helping push trough the side quests. Combat wasn’t the problem, it was willpower. In the end I managed to defend Hrogar’s Hill with a total of 2 hit points remaining. Epic quest and super hard. 
 

total tokens used 1 (to help pay for a round one Eagles of the Misty Mountains and Radagast’s staff)

## 15 [General_Grievous on November 13, 2020](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/312272-solo-league-27-wilds-of-rhovanionered-mithrin-with-shadows-of-mirkwood-player-cards/?do=findComment&comment=4013662)

Fate of the Wilderland was a rough go too. First attempt I drew the strongest orc enemy in the deck and this trend continued as I just couldn’t get enough defenders into play to keep up. And not drawing Radagast’s staff also hurt me. With my general lack of defenders at the mid game it meant I was taken out and my heroes were wiped out by undefended attacks.
 

Next attempt with 1 token went much smoother as I also started with Radagast’s staff in play. I was able to get some solid Eagle flocks into play and win as soon as I got to the third phase. 
 

Total tokens 1

 

Total tokens for all three quests: 2

Fire in the night finally ended in a win at 12 tokens. On to a scenario I should know a thing or two about, seeing as I wrote the article for it on VotP, and also the first LOTR thing my girlfriend got for me: The Fate of Wilderland!

## 17 [Bobbymcbobface on November 15, 2020](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/312272-solo-league-27-wilds-of-rhovanionered-mithrin-with-shadows-of-mirkwood-player-cards/?do=findComment&comment=4014434)

Fate of Wilderland was a lot simpler with a three token win. What I learned from this month, is that it’s a really bad idea to not play test before starting the solo league. Every month before now I’ve playtested my deck multiple times against all scenarios before beginning. This time I just threw the deck together and figured it would work, because my eagle decks have done great lately. But what I forgot was, since I have made a commitment to only use in cycle cards I did not have a very good questing hero at all. That was my biggest downfall and the reason I took so many tokens. Great job everyone, and I look forward to choosing the supplementary cycle for next time!

My Silvans are doing a great job, so far. The Journey was smooth. Fire in the Night took a while, and I am glad I decided to leave the first side quest (the one that does damage to the city every round according to enemies in staging), which gave me more time to build up (I needed to get rid of the two nastiest side quests quickly, the one that removes defense and the one where the city burns), and only remove the third side quest, when I was ready (I had a bunch of the other side quests already with 6-8 progress by then, with Galadriel+Nenya and Henamarth there was a good amount of control over the quest phase, so they would easily fall one by one, once the real battle begun). I had three Silvan Trackers before finding any defense buff (other than Inner Strength) for Thranduil, but at least that was enough to defend his one attack at the end of the planning phase. Once he was properly equipped, though, there was little the dragon and minions could do, anymore. Fate might be more difficult, though, especially the early phase. We'll see. 🙂

The Fate of Wilderland has been decided. 1 token was needed (as expected, since the scenario is very random in solo), as the first attempt was stopped abruptly after I lost all my resources to that treachery (otherwise, a Sneak Attack Gandalf and an extra Silvan could have helped out) and got two new enemies (the one with surge and one from location exploration, which happened to be the big goblin troop). The second attempt was better, though, and I managed to get to Urdug early in the third stage (naturally, once there, he didn't really stand a chance).

So in January we will play against A Shadow in the East/ Vengeance of Mordor with the addition of cards from LOTR Saga.

Thanee has selected The River Running and RNG has selected The City of Ulfast and Under the Ash Mountains, so prepare yourselves for some great hardships.

The mandatory heroes list is Leadership Frodo, Smeagol, Lothiriel and Gildor Inglorion
