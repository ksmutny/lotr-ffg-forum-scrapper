# [Bellach´s Folly](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/131004-bellach%C2%B4s-folly/)

Seems to me that one would be able to kill Bellach right after finishing Quest 1B.

After you do so, that quest becomes inactive and the new active quest is Quest 2A which reads that Bellach makes an immediate attack; though at no point on Quest 2A does it say that Bellach is immune to player cards, so a combination of Spear of the Citadel, Gondorian Spearman and/or Swift Strike (maybe others) should be able to bring him down at this point, seeing as neither Quest 1B nor 2B (which contain the text making Bellach immune) are active at the moment he is making his attack.

Would this not be valid?

 

Apologies if this has been discussed earlier.

Text of the cards ?

With what you said, it seems doable.

Quest 1B:

Time 3. Forced: After the last time counter is removed from this stage, trigger eachScour effect currently in play. Place 3 time counters on this stage.
Bellach is immune to player card effects and cannot be engaged.
The players cannot advance unless Celebrimbor’s Mould is attached to a hero. 

 

Quest 2A (the active card for Bellach´s attack):

When Revealed: Trigger each Scour effect currently in play. Bellach makes an attack against the player who controls Celebrimbor’s Mould. Then, attach Celebrimbor’s Mould to Bellach.

 

Quest 2B:

Time 3. Forced: After the last time counter is removed from this stage, trigger eachScour effect currently in play. Place 3 time counters on this stage.
Unless there is at least 12 progress on this stage, Bellach is immune to player card effects and cannot be engaged.
The players cannot defeat this stage unless Celebrimbor’s Mould is attached to a hero. If the players defeat this stage, they win the game.

But, would that be the intention?

If you are correct, I should sent Caleb an email, so he can come with an errata.

Probably not the intention; which is why I raise the question in the first place

So, if it's not the intention, then you could also ignore it and don't try to kill Bellach yet.  ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

Which is what we did in our game (rather than risk cheating).

But just because we chose to ignore it at that instance does not mean the larger question should be forgotten, wether it is possible or not.

Will sent a request to Caleb.

Well, technically, seing the text. the rules allow it.

It's not an official answer we need, but an errata.

I hope he don't come up with some other mechanics out of the hat that allow him not to make an errata and will confuse us more with the timing flow of the game.

Been 2 days now without a response on my inquiry. Maybe I caught them off guard or Caleb is having an extended vacation? :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

I have one pending from last year!

Got the response today.

 

The question:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Seems to me that one would be able to kill Bellach right after finishing Quest 1B.
 After you do so, that quest becomes inactive and the new active quest is Quest 2A which reads that Bellach makes an immediate attack; though at no point on Quest 2A does it say that Bellach is immune to player cards, so a combination of Spear of the Citadel, Gondorian Spearman and/or Swift Strike (maybe others) should be able to bring him down at this point, seeing as neither Quest 1B nor 2B (which contain the text making Bellach immune) are active at the moment he is making his attack.
 Would this be valid?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

The Answer:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

What you are describing is an oversight on our part as a design team. It should not be possible for players to damage Bellach before advancing to stage 2B. It may be necessary to errata stage 2A to add “Bellach cannot take damage during this attack.”
Hope you’re enjoying Celebrimbor’s Secret!
Cheers,
Caleb

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

So there we have it. One of the suspected answers and I think this is the first time I sent a rules query, that seems to make it to the errata.

Yay me! :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

Oh noes, for more erratas to remember!

Would be nice with a pack (will gladly pay the $$$ for it) containing all the errataed cards for those of us who got the game from day one and have much to remember
