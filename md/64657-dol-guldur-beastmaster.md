if he kills the defending character the additional shadow card still counts as a defended challenge when you reveal it?

Or does it mean that that shadow card isn't revealed until next round so he will have 2 shadow cards every time he attacks except for the first attack?

You reveal BOTH of his Shadow cards during step 3 (Resolve shadow effect) when the DGB attacks.

 why does it say "after he attacks" then? "when he attacks" sounds a lot more clear

 You're absolutely right.  The FAQ clarifies this.  This is an example of cards made toward the beginning of the game not being as precise as they could be.  Check the link in my signature for the FAQ - it clears up a few of these issues.

 thanks for clarifying that. I had read roughly the faq before but I completely missed the paragraph that talks specifically of this card :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]
