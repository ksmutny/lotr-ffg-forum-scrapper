I wish I could find a way to visually track progress through scenarios.  Right now I have a spreadsheet which lists all the scenarios, the dates I played them, and whether I won or lost.  It's functional, but not very fun to look at.

 

Is there a more entertaining way to keep track of your progress through scenarios?

 

For example, what if there were a map showing the routes of each scenario, so that when you start a quest, you could put a token on the start of the route for that scenario, and then when you beat the scenario, you'd get to move the token to the end?  Something like that, especially a computerized version, would be awesome.  And relatively simple to implement, since it doesn't need to know anything about the rules of the game.

 

Some additional features would be:

- separate icons for each deck (or "fellowship") that you create

- color-coded trails representing your decks' progress through the "grand campaign" (set of scenarios)

- ability to click on a deck to edit it or load it into OCTGN (if possible)

- anything else we can think of?

For starters, is there a map which shows the scenario routes?

The LOTR LCg online quest companion has a quest loging system, and ringsdb should have one soon. FFG have their own quest loging sysytem on their web site.

But your map is a cool idea!

The atlas is very cool, but I was hoping for something with a scale between the 2 levels I saw on there (expansion level vs location card level).

 

Instead of seeing individual locations, I would want to see the routes (or areas) covered by each quest.  There would be a start point and an end point, and we'd get to move our token from the start to the end only after conquering that quest.  I wouldn't want to bother with updating the icon for each location card visited, although if we had a thoroughly computerised version of LotR LCG that would be awesome to see as well.

 

The goal of a map representation is to give a visual sense of progress as we start and conquer each quest.  So, when we beat a quest, we'd get to move our icon as a "reward".  Make sense?
