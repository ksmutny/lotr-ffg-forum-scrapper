In your opinion what is the card that has the best thematic according to the character, weapon, location it represents?

 

For me it would be boromir tactics; since he is just so thematic IMHO. His action of readying himself just feels like it is just following the characters lore, and his other action also feels ok for his action of sacrifice.

Gandalf (CORE) is very thematic. It stays only one round, like the history, his help is powerful but he not always is with the fellowship, only sometimes.

Combination of Name, Art and Stats/Text. Perfect.

Palantir is just a thematic win but a terrible card s gameplay perspective

Black Arrow.  Thematic home run and an awesome card to use.

Wut. In a 3 player game it's the best card money can buy.

There are lots of cards that are very thematic. I quite like Rivendell Minstrel's ability to deliver you a song.

I know he is way OP, but I really like Elrond thematically.

I think the fact that he can ready so many times kinda ruins the realistic-ness and therefore also the level or thematic-ness.

Personally I really love the thematic-ness of Galadriel.

Oh, this is interesting. I totally agree about how well the theme is represented by the card, and also about how difficult it is to make the card work for your deck. I have had some sort of success in the past but it was a great labour to achieve, I basically had to dedicate the entire deck-building to this one mechanic, which in the end does not win you anything. So I abandoned it a long time ago, hoping that one day the card will spring back to action.

 

For me it is obvious. Tactics Boromir is a great thematic card. Core Gandalf too, even the Hobbit version with the raising of the threat when he lingers. Then, hero Denethor, now Galadriel too. I really like Miruvor and the idea beyond Rivendell Minstrel. I wish Master of the Forge had better stats but would only bring weapons and/or items -- I feel that was a big thematic miss.

too difficult !! :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] ...for me I think it is either..hmmm...fatty, because I just love that part of the book, and the art represents it perfectly for me, or ..yes tactics boromir, certainly a real thematic sacrifice

 

having said that I could sit here for days listing them :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

Beorn ally or Samwise. Sorry for short answer. I'll elaborate if anyone needs me to :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

There are so many ... I would choose light of valinor or Galadriel ... Gandalf from the core set too, Black arrow ... I mean, i cannot decide

Oh yeah, Dragon-Spell is a great thematic card, almost forgot about that one.

Thicket of Spears, it runs amazing in quests like Massing of Osgiliath, Cair Andros... Like the big combats.

i wonder what people would think the least thematic card would be? i don't want to derail this thread though ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

 

i think another one of my favourites has to be mountain goblin - the guy from redhorn gate...you know when i read the hobbit for the first time i imagined that guy, all other artist's goblins don't come close

I've wondered the same thing.

Horn-of-Gondor.png [http://hallofbeorn.com/Images/Cards/Core-Set/Horn-of-Gondor.png]

It takes a bit more explanation than the card I find most thematic.

The horn of Gondor is symbolic in the books. It represents all that is Good in Boromir and ultimately helps him to triumph over his base self.

Obviously with it's iconic use in his death the card was always likely to involve characters dying (leaving play) - I just think that gaining resources off of it is totally wrong for what the card should have been. It makes no thematic sense.

The card itself is perfectly valid I just think it should have been called something different - Grave Cairn would have been a better name for this card than it was for it's own effect.

 

I hope we get an alternative  horn of Gondor in the future. Still in tactics - personally I think it should have been if attached character leaves play, ready all characters in play. The blowing of the horn warned all of the fellowship of the danger and allowed them to react, but it meant the death of the hornblower.

## 22 [ana4 on May 14, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/106033-most-thematic-card/?do=findComment&comment=1083975)

The early cards were often hit or miss. Horn of Gondor is a great example. It is one card that absolutely should have gone to Boromir, no matter what. I could live with "attach to a Gondor Noble Hero" but of course they could not have made such a card for the core set. They should have waited just as they did with Asfaloth, for instance. Horn of Gondor appears on about every art of Boromir, it is very, very iconic and symbolic to him. Now, we have only seen multiple versions of characters but I do hope very much we shall see a second version of the Horn of Gondor (which attaches to Boromir only).

I really like Asfaloth, especially paired with Glorfindel.

Having tried Galadriel, I must say she is very thematic as well. She is a powerful presence, but does not charge into battle herself. I think we'll have many thematic cards in the new cycle.

Most of the cards are a nice blending of theme and mechanics.I think the design team has done a really nice job with the game actually.  Most card games feel like the mechanics all came first, then the theme came later but I feel like this one is different. 

I haven't tried all the LCG's but Game of the Thrones, Call of Cthulhu and Warhammer all feel like they're mechanics first, and then fluff. It's probably a subjective thing though.

I totally agree with the above. I used to play Magic, and though it was not a bad game, the theme was not there for me. It was all over the place -- but I understand it all comes from a very different source. For me, Tolkien means a lot, and the game seems to represent the spirit very well (with some exceptions which are to be expected in the scope).

I agree, Ana, I've played MtG and Lotr, and Lotr blows it away imo, and it's the theme problem that does it.  I can't visualize anything but random fantasy craziness when playing MtG.  There's no central story, setting, or anything with it to compare with Middle Earth.

Horn of gondor - I think the new version should do something like draw allies from a deck or something...or perhaps make enemies willingness to engage less...so reduce engagement cost or something
