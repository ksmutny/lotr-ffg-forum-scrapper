so my question is fairly basic, does the core set come with playsets of all the cards for 1 player?   I hope FFG has learned from W:I, AGoT, and cthulu that i would like full playsets of the cards without having to buy multiple quest packs.

Only adventure packs and expansion boxes come with the 3 of each copy. All the games core sets do not come with 3 of each to allow for increased card variety in the amount of cards available. Not that you need a play set for any of the LCG's.

btw, I just tought of that...

So, the minimum card ammount in a player deck is 50 I guess... and when you run out of cards, you lose.. right??

Sooooo.... isn't it better to make a palyer deck with like 100 cards, that way, you have lower chances to run out of cards... or is there a limit??

(I don't play card games in a LOOOOOONG time, I don't remember what I did in those times)

No you dont lose if you run out of cards, you continue the game with what you have in play (heroes, allys etc).So there is no need to make a deck with 100 cards cause you will never have the cards you want or need fast and you will lose almost every game.

A couple of notes.


When you no longer have cards to draw, you get no new cards each turn. Not getting cards is bad, but you do not automatically lose.


Second, you only need to pad your deck if you are likely to go through all of it. In a deck that doesn't draw additional cards, you would have to play 40+ turns to exhaust a 50 card card deck. I feel confident saying that most games won't go on anywhere near that long. Remember, at that time you would also have around 70 threat, even if you never gained threat from anything but your turn ending. It is possible (though, I think, unlikely) that a deck with a ton of card drawing might want to run with more than 50 cards, but we won't know that until we see the game. Even in such a scenario, you would probably be better off incorporating the Will card that allows you to reshuffle your discards into your deck, rather than playing with an oversized monstrosity of deck.


In general, you want to make a deck with as close to the minimum number of cards as possible, because that gives you the best chance of drawing your strongest cards. By keeping to fifty cards, you decrease the effects of random draws, and let you focus your deck on whatever it happens to be good at.

 Which sphere is the card that lets you reshuffle your discards into your deck? I know it is too soon to seriously plan decks, but I already am. And I think I need that card.

It's spirit, though I can not remember the name of the card.

It is Spirit and the card's called "Will of the West" It's in the "Playing Part 1" Video.

Thanks, Narsil.

Between Will of the West and Fortune and Fate, it seems like bringing things back from your discard pile falls solidly under the domain of spirit.

Making your deck bigger than the minimum makes it harder to get the card you want/need. I rarely if ever go over minimum deck size.

As for running out of cards I have played AGoT and Warhammer Invasion LCGs, a lot. And never in any of my games run out of cards so I wouldn't see it as being an issue. Maybe if you are trying to play through all the scenarios in one straight through nightmare scenario, although in that case I would be more worried about wounds/threat than running out of cards.

I have many times in Warhammer and only one in aGoT.  It is a viable strategy in Warhammer though since you lose the game if you don't draw.  In LoTR (and aGoT) you just don't have any cards anymore!

I've run out of cards several times in AGoT using the smaller core-set only deck, but never with a full deck using expansions - I hope the smaller sized core-set only decks in this game don't have the same problem.

If you account for the card drawing effects we know of, a 30 card Lore deck will have to worry about cards, especially in solo play.  If you play 3 Lorien's wealth (even 2 could cause problems) and a gandalf, you would run out of cards in 12 turns.  The same deck using Bilbo as a hero would run out of cards in only 6 turns.  And all of that assumes that those are the only available cards that grant additional draws. 

 

edit: Of course, actually focusing exclusively on card-draw in single player is a poor strategy and would probably cost you the game.  I just wanted to illustrate that, even with the cards we have now, a 30 card limit will effect the way a Lore deck plays.

I guess it would be too much to hope that most Player cards will come with two copies in the core set. If they did, then I could buy two core sets. I'd have most of a full play set of player cards plus a copy for a binder (because the artwork is just so nice). Please don't let me down, FFG.
