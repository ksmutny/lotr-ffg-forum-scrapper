i was thinking of using it against durins bane (the balrog and its high armour class)

 

now 2 stackable rivendell blades  on the same character,  knocking 4 off  durin banes armour, would make this card worth putting in a deck

 

however if its not stackable makes it still ok but not great

 

what is it please great or ok?

yes they are. unless a card specifies otherwise their effects are generally stackable…so 2 blade = -4 defense, 2 blades of gondolin = +2 attack when attack an orc and 2 progress

remember that some weapons and so on are restricted though, so you couldnt have 3 blades for -6 defense

as for the card itself i think it is one of the best weapons available in the game….most enemies will have around 2 defense, so if you have one of these on a 3 attack character with perhaps a dunedain +1 attack buff….good times :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]   its especially good on a readying character such as elladan or a character with unexpected courage…..you can wipe out a whole battalion of orcs in one turn

In a deck I've been playing with recently I use these with Legolas for lots-o-fun.  Combines well with Straight Shot too!  And if I have extras I can plug 'em on a Rivendell Minstrel or Imladris Stargazer, usually useless for combat, but suddenly becomes a debuffing master!
