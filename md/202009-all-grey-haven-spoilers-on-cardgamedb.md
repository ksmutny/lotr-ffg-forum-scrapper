Looks like at least one of the quests uses SIX encounter sets. I think that's a record.

Lots of the encounter cards might not have strong stats but have deadly effects.

Time to start deckbuilding in order to be ready :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Why? You're not allowed to purchase your own merchandise? What's wrong with just taking the box and paying it's cost on the spot?

 

 

What's "Lune" by the way?

Do you refer to the sailer of Lune?

 

The area of the sea where the Grey heavens are located is called the Gulf of Lune, because the river Lune enters the sea at that point.

How do you like this new "drown" theme, where enemies and some other effects put your allies on the bottom of your deck, and in some cases your objective ally can "pull" them out of the water into your hand (or you can try tideously force shuffle your deck in the hope to rescue (draw) them)? :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I'm glad the allies still count as "destroyed", so specific effects trigger (Horn of Gondor)

 

Theme wise it fits perfectly I think, as you said, it builds the Feeling your ally was thrown into the water and flushed away, but with the help of some Cards (objective ally etc.) you can rescue him or maybe you sail across him again through pure luck (Shuffle).

 

Obviously decks that like to manipulate the discard pile (Noldor comes to mind) might have to change Play a little bit.

 

But again: Thematic homerun

Thematically I think it's fine.  We'll see how it really plays.  In some decks where you are constantly searching and shuffling it will matter not.  In others...

When I called my FLGS, they told me that Asmodee is trying to sync up the release dates of all of FFG's games now, so even though they had it in they couldn't sell it yet. The guy behind the counter didn't know what the release date was, but I assume it will be the same day the news announcement goes out about it.

I find it strange that he can't simply arrange a deal with his boss behind the curtain. Maybe the level of trust between them is so low, but here where I live a thing like that would be a no-brainer.

They seem to be pushing "street-dates" so that things get out all at the same time.  It isn't really a matter of trust between employer and employee but of that between FFG and the store.  If FFG found out the store owner had released the product early - even just to employees - it could jeopardize their relationship with FFG.  theoretically.

Well, that is if they find out. But they won't, as that would be the point of the deal "behind the curtain between the boss and an employee".

Somehow, encouraging this sort of backroom dealing on FFG's official forums just seems like poor form.

Encouraging it is fine. Pretending you definitely haven't got a copy early is even better. Enjoy it jjohnson111! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

It doesn't to me. No harm done to either of parties. We already got full spoilers for the entire set. What can go wrong if some fan gets the set ahead of release and no one ultimately finds out about it whatsoever? Nothing.
