I see that many people add 10 points to their score every additional round they play.  But I can't find this in the rule-book.  Anyway, that penalizes you for turtling, which I don't like.  Is this a thing people just do, or can someone give me a quote from the booklet?

Thanks in advance.

They introduced this rule at a later date and its the new scoring system. You can easily just use the old scoring system if you prefer it and use turtling strategies. I use the old scoring :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Can't think of exactly where and when they changed it but it might be part of a news article from a while back or something?

I believe the updated scoring system is explained in the FFG official FAQ for the game. Don't have time to double check right now.

It's from the FAQ:

Scoring
This section introduces an additional element to the scoring system presented on page 22 of the core rulebook. This revised scoring will be implemented at all FFG sanctioned organized play events, and should be used on the LOTR LCG Quest Log available at FantasyFlightGames.com.
In addition to all elements currently used to score a game, players also add an additional 10 points to their “final group score” for each round of play that is taken to defeat a scenario. Players tally each round for their score at the end of the refresh phase.
A modified scoring sheet has been provided as the final page of this document. The tally of rounds can be tracked on the notes section of these sheets.

that sucks, cause I've been logging without knowing this, and there are quite a number of quest I really don't want to have to go back and do. a well, back to square one!

I use the official scoring system but put have begun putting the number of rounds spend on a game in the notes section when I log.

The old scoring system is just silly...with treath reduction you can easily have very low treath at The end of The game...and this would lead to an absolute dominance of treath reduction decks and obsolete alla other decks in a scoring environment

Well, loop deck and even broken non-loop deck can manage to win nearly anything with less than 10 points... it's not the scoring system that is broken.

Yeah you are right but the game isn't competitive and people could say if they're using a deck with an overload of threat reduction. If you are punished for extra rounds any slower decks or turtling strategies suffer and would have horrible scores compared to everyone else. I play the game to beat it and have fun not beat it as fast as possible and find the new scoring system just as silly as the old.

Both have pros and cons in my opinion.

It's a decent indicator of performance, so it help me evaluate the effectiveness of different decks. In the end, it doesn't make much difference, but it's a nice statistic for us math geeks.

I think that actual scoring privilege aggressive deck compared with control deck.

 

So this kind of scoring wasn't for me a good indicator of performance.

A good indicator of performance is a ratio of victory/fail on a set of revelant scenario.

I use the new scoring system, adding the 10 points per turn, but as mentioned above, I do not care about it and most of the time build decks that are not fast  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

One thing I've always wondered is say you beat a quest but one player is out from 50 threat. Does that player add 50 threat to score, is the player considered to have 3 destroyed heroes, or is that player not included in the score as well

If a player is eliminated via threat, I have never added the eliminated player's hero values to the final score, unless they were actually killed during the game.   However, I just looked more closely at the manual, and it looks like I should be doing this after all:

 

When a player is eliminated, his threat is considered to be 50, and all of his heroes are considered dead. Note that an eliminated player’s threat does not, however,  increase beyond his threat elimination level (50,  unless otherwise specified by the quest rules or by a card effect).
