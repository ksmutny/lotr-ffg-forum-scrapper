1. Go to the exit directly and  if its a trap, you loose(>50%)

2. Use the old tool to dig out the exit

Run through Balrog is really risky so better get the tools and brake the wall. This quest actually is quite easy for solo but going to be really hard with 3 otr 4 players. If you play solo dont move to the next quest stage every turn until you ready for that. Otherwise in can be really risky.

2. Is this a trick Question?

With all the readying good decks pack you should be able to bust through in 2 turns (or one - Dain, Cram, Lure of Moria, Erebor Record Keeper was my last go)
