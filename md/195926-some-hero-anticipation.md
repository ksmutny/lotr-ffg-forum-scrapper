So, now that the Flame of the West announcement seems inevitable, unless the announcement team has already gone on holiday, what do you think the heroes will be? I think we are going to see at least one in the announcement, though it was not so last time if I remember correctly.

 

Additionally, what are your guesses about the second hero in the Grey Havens? I feel the safe bet is Noldor: Khazad, Heirs, Voice, Realm, they all had two heroes of the same trait, belonging to the area. But how about the sphere? Well, it is not going to be Spirit and it will most likely not be Leadership because it was already announced we are getting a Leadership hero in the first pack, and also Leadership doesn't feel right for Noldor, though they do have Elrohir hero and Galadriel ally, together with the Scout of Imladris, I believe. My personal guess is then Tactics rather than Lore because we have recently got Erestor, and it would be great to see another Tactics Elf. After all, Elven Spear falls into the category, and there is a picture of Revealed in Wrath which is clearly a Noldor (Glorfindel) theme card.

Flame of the west is Return of the King part 1, right?

 

I don't know for that, but I bet my money that in the last Saga box we will have Tactics Eowyn.

Tactics Imrahil 

## 5 [13edl@m on December 15, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/195926-some-hero-anticipation/?do=findComment&comment=1936700)

The tradition throughout deluxe expansions since Khazad-dum has been to include a tactics hero.  Aside from Glorfindel I don't know that there are many named Noldor characters in middle earth at this period that would naturally fall into a tactic role. I don't believe it will be Glorfindel because an allied version of him has already been spoiled for the cycle.  Though all this is only precedent and may not mean anything.  

 

Personally I believe that Ecthelion of the fountain would be about as great as a suggestion as possible.  Tolkien fans know elves after death exist in limbo at Mandos until the end of times.  Unless said elf soloed a Balrog.  In what Tolkien finished this refers to Glorfindel and Ecthelion.  There is some debate on the subject of Glorfindel of Gondolin being the same as Glorfindel of Imladris.  I believe the general consensus is that they are the same.  Gandalf himself and his transition from Grey to White provides some precedence for this. As he hints at his experiences of returning from the dead after soloing a Balrog.  

 

Well, I don't know whether the creators have the licensing and feel licensed to follow this precedent and create an Ecthelion Hero. A proven warrior sent back to middle-earth to oppose Sauron.  I think players would be excited though as a personage in somewhat equal stature with the likes of Glorfindel and Gandalf and perhaps moreso as Gothmog was captain of the seven and known to be responsible for all sorts of horrible acts in his time.  The timing seems propitious as the developers seem set on exploring the liminal aspects of middle-earth and traveling Westward, the direction of the blessed realm.  But who can say?

Looking trough the chapters of Rotk Part 1 some events are prety eyecatching:
1. The Grey Company moves through the paths of the dead.

2. The Siege of Minas Tirith

3. The Ride of the Rohirim and the battle on the fields of the Pelenor

4. The "Aftermath" of the Battle (Houses of Healing, Denethor's death etc.)

5. The march to the Black Gate and ist opening.

 

Frodo and Sam only appear in the second part, so I think it's safe to say there wont be anything about their side of the story.

 

So far all Saga-heroes had a part to Play in the story of the Expansion (Hobbits in Black Riders, Gandalf in road darkens etc.). It doesn't seem to matter all that much if a character already has a hero incarnation (Théoden), ally incarnation (Treebeard, Gandalf) or didn't appear before (Sam, Pippin etc.), so I wouldn't try to guess based on existing characters (maybe except for Aragorn; there is only the Spirit and ally Version left and I am not sure there will ever be every possible Aragorn Version).

 

So which characters are iconic/important for the above mentioned Events?

-the hunter trio: Aragorn, Gimli, Legolas

-the Grey Company members: Halbarad, Elrond's sons

- Gandalf and Pippin

- Eowyn and Merry

-Théoden and Eomer

-Beregond and Bergil

-Denethor and Faramir

(These are all I can remember and would give the important "Keyword" :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png])

 

So who can we kick out of this? (=VERY unlikely imo)

Halbarad -> Just became a hero in lost realm

Elrond's sons -> they don't have that big of a role and I don't think there is a way to make them thematic heroes in a diffrent way than the one they already exist

Gandalf -> I wouldn't like a "sphere Gandalf" and an other neutral hero Gandalf is very unlikely.

Merry -> A tactics Version of him would be great for this Expansion. Oh wait...

Théoden -> We have him as a fighter (tatics) and as the leader of the rohirim (Spirit). What else could you do with this character?

Bergil -> Just a kid

 

The rest of the pack could be possible in my opinion, even though some more than others. My guess:

Aragorn: He will be a hero in this box. But he will be the Fellowship hero :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] (as he is more important than Legolas/Gimli and is the only left main character who goes through the paths of the dead)

Legolas/Gimli: These two have more or less the same chances. They could be a possibility or get split one in this the other in the next, but there are better guesses as I only see a Leadership version of them.

Pippin: Had his Spirit form way before Merry, but he could show us how good of a tactics hero he would proof in the siege of the White City. He would be one of my final guesses if not for two or three other characters. I also believe we will stay with one tactics hobbir hero forever.

Beregond: Woudn't be to surprised if we get him, but what other role than a super Defender could he fill?

Eowyn : Here we go . I will bet on her tactics inarnation. There is just no better moment to introduce this than this battle. The death of the witch-king deserves a hero to replay it again and again. Extra Points: This is the only part of the books where Eowyn fights (she is wounded and can't participate in the battle at the black gate)

Eomer: An other of my favorite guesses. his would be his Leadership Version, but this might be even better for the last Expansion, after Théoden is dead, I don't know and Théoden dies "during" this box. Overall I think Eowyn is the safer bet and two Rohan heroes in Gondor's greatest battle? Would be strange, but on the other Hand Rohan pretty much saves the City at the last moment.

Faramir: He could become a tactics hero, but is wounded for most of the remaining storyline, but still possible.

Denethor: I would put him above Eomer. We only have his lore hero and a pretty old Leadership ally. So a Spirit or Leadership hero does seem to fit the Expansion quite well. I would imagine a "drawback hero" like Grima or Spiritfindel. Maybe he could boost our allies, just to become mad and make them flee (=Shuffle into deck/discard them)? Or he could have very strong stats which unstopable go down every round until he kills himself (showing how the once strong leader gets mad and suicides)? I think you could do cool Things with him.

 

To the conclusion:

1. Aragorn (Fellowship)

2. Eowyn (Tactics)

3. Denethor (Spirit/Leadership)

 

This Trio has one of the great heroes of the story (Aragorn) who can participate in every quest of the box as he takes part in every Event in the first part of the book. Eowyn kills the witch-king and is an iconic character, there won't be a better moment to publish a tactics verson of her (now or never). Finally Denethor (I prefer a Spirit Version, but Leadership is an Option)  doesn't do all that much in the books (or movie :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]), but I would put him on the same Level of relevenz as treebeard (and he became a hero too). This way we have "1 of everything": Aragorn from the first book/the Fellowship, Eowyn second book/Rohan and Denethor third book/Gondor. This would represent the "teameffort" it took to hold Minas Tirith.

Yes, FotW is saga no. 5.

 

As much as it makes sense to include her, there are some indications that make me think otherwise: the fact she is in the core set, and the designers might prefer to give those who only follow saga a new hero, and also (to a much lesser degree) Herugrim that helps Rohan heroes gain attack strength through willpower.

Wow, thanks for the input. I am inclined to believe the designers look more for theme than mechanics when they choose their saga characters. So although I agree it might be hard to create a new Beregond, I think his role in the book is substantial enough to grant a saga character. I am guessing an ally, but I would not be surprised by a hero version (after all, his part is much greater than Damrod's).

Éomer is a given hero bet.

Imrahil surely a character: probably a hero too.

Éowyn and Denethor, based on the above "logic" of mine, I think allies.

And I am hoping for ally versions of Merry and Pippin. I keep repeating this but perhaps they could gain the Rohan and Gondor traits, respectively.

 

And spheres are always intriguing, and harder to guess than names.

There's one version of a hero missing : spirit Aragorn.

## 12 [Finduin on December 15, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/195926-some-hero-anticipation/?do=findComment&comment=1936977)

Do not forget that the Saga Expansions give us 4 uniques allies (one from each sphere), so is possible to see Beregond, or Imrahil as allies.

## 13 [wehehe on December 15, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/195926-some-hero-anticipation/?do=findComment&comment=1937053)

This is an interesting topic.

 

I bet that Aragorn will get it's spirit version in the last saga box. An spirit Aragorn representing the king of Gondor. (Maybe with the traits Dúnedain, King, Gondor?)

 

For the next box, I'm totally agree with Calvadur, I believe that Eowyn and Denethor are great choices for this part of the story. Just an issue... I believe that Denethor should be Leadership (totally agree with the idea of giving him a drawback to represent it's madness).

## 14 [Kjeld on December 15, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/195926-some-hero-anticipation/?do=findComment&comment=1937127)

What about Ioreth? A hero to give company to the Wardens of Healing would be pretty cool.

## 15 [Gizlivadi on December 15, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/195926-some-hero-anticipation/?do=findComment&comment=1937183)

While Ioreth is cool, I really doubt she is most-climactic-saga-expansion hero material. She'll definately appear during one of the cycles. As for the heroes, I already said Tactics Eoawyn should be inevitable, and as for the other, it's most likely gonna be Leadership, but I don't really know. I think we'll get Merry and Pippin as allies, probably Merry in Tactics or Spirit and Pippin in Leadership, each with their respective Gondor and Rohan traits. Leadership Denethor who gets a drawback for his madness already exists, and he's pretty terrible. I doubt he'll appear in the Flame of the West.

We can already do that. In campaign mode, you can choose to revive Gandalf with the Beyond All Hope boon. Yes, that means I don't think we'll ever see a "Gandalf the White" hero. Designers already stated current Gandalf is supposed to be the most powerful hero, so no, I don't think we'll ever see another one.

 

Imrahil, Halbarad, Beregond, those are all good choices for allies. I doubt we'll se hero versions of them.

It was not so much for killing a Balrog solo. It might look that way but it is said in Unfinished Tales that Elves could grow themselves another body again. Their spirits host that body. No Elf would return to ME however, except Glorfindel.

Also, Ecthelion of the Fountains would not fit the licensing, but also not the scene at all. Like I said, only Glorfindel ever returned. (Notes Tolkien made before he died, say that he wanted to make the two Glorfindels the same person, but he died too soon to implement this.)

Ecthelion is someone who, in my opinion, does not fit the time at all. This would be different then an FFG-made hero. That would be taking someone out of 'time and thought' and dropping him thousands of years later in some story. FFG-made heroes are heroes fit in the story and timeline.

You are aware that we are going to get Fellowship Aragorn right?

Is it certain that Saga box 5 is limited/purely about the first book in Return of the King?

Or could they also just select one storyline and make it about that? So, for example, Aragorn, resulting in Army of the Death, Siege of Minas Tirith & Battle of the Pelennor Fields and lastly the Battle of the Black Gate to tie box 6 into the story?

Mister Outlands, Hirluin might be an ally. Imrahil, ally maybe?

I would think Denethor a good hero, but he is in the Core Set.

Eomer does not, might make a good hero. Leadership version to represent him taking lead over the Rohirrim as their (soon-to-be) new king.

Aragorn will most likely be a Fellowship hero and I think he will get a Spirit version or ally version in box 6.

Gandalf the White would be awesome, but I think Gandalf remains Gandalf. In the timeframe of our game, the years between the start of the Hunt for Gollum and the start of the War, if I remember correctly, Gandalf is Grey and that does only change outside the timeframe. For Saga purposes they included the Boon.

Another Imrahil hero would be excellent, as would Tactics Eowyn. As Halbarad dies here (and we just got him), I don't think he is too likely. Versions of Merry and Pipping with the Rohan/Gondor traits would also be a very welcome addition, though they now have two hero cards each and I don't know how much play ally versions would receive.

 

An Ioreth ally, obviously focusing on healing, would be excellent. Maybe spirit Aragorn would also focus on healing? Could have the same quote on both cards. Previous Aragorn hero cards (Lore, Leadership) have had powerful abilities bleeding in from other spheres. There are, I think, a couple of named outlands lords as well.

## 25 [NathanH on December 15, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/195926-some-hero-anticipation/?do=findComment&comment=1937381)

I would not expect them to include a Hero that appears as a Core Set hero or an earlier Saga Hero. I wouldn't expect Tactics Eowyn as a Hero. Perhaps as an Ally, or (unlikely, but would be fun) a Dernhelm attachment that goes on her. There are quite a lot of possible characters for the Ally slots. For Hero my guess would be Eomer and Imrahil, they satisfy my conditions and are probably the two most important characters who do.

In solo, just having them with the Rohan and Gondor traits and a decent ability will almost guarantee they see play.

There would be no point in creating another Fellowship hero specifically for the portions of the book without Frodo, and mentioning he "can't be used as a hero when playing any scenario from a product other than The Lord of the Rings Saga Expansions" if they were not going to give us another one in Flame of the West.

For Flame of the West, I think Imrahil and Eomer are probably the most likely heroes, but I could maybe see Leadership Beregond being a thing? Legolas, Gimli, Denethor and Eowyn would all be great candidates but I think people are probably right that they won't duplicate heroes who were in the Core Set or earlier in the Saga so people running only Core + Saga will have more options. Ally versions of Denethor, Eowyn and Beregond (assuming he isn't a hero in the box, which I don't think is that likely) seem pretty likely though. Ally versions of Halbarad and Elrond's sons are also possibilities. Ally hobbits I think are more likely to turn up in the 6th box.

## 30 [RebelX on December 15, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/195926-some-hero-anticipation/?do=findComment&comment=1937604)

Very interesting discussion. What always should be remembered is that Saga expansions are also designed with the players in mind who only own the core set.  For that reason we got no new Legolas/Gimli heroes and I assume for that reason we will not get another Eowyn or Denethor.

 

Personally I like this approach as I think that the CS+Saga crows should have a decent pool of heroes to choose from. I would have loved it if they had continued with the 4 heroes each expansion approach. In that case we would have had the room for another Gimli/Legolas or Tactics Eowyn. As it is I support the approach that we get no hero duplicates inside this “cycle”. Those of us who post here for the most part pick up each expansion or AP, so we will eventually get our Lore Legolas or Tactics Eowyn.

 

So let’s get on with the speculation. So far we have had 1 neutral, 3 lore, 2 spirit, 2 leadership and 1 tactics hero in the saga expansions. That should leave us with one spirit, one leadership and two tactics heroes to come (and a decent pool of 6 heroes each sphere to choose from).

 

To be honest a lot of time has passed since I have read the books, so this are rather guesses for the most part. What I remember is that a lot of new characters were introduced in book three but nobody in the Frodo/Sam part. Therefore I assume we will have another spill over to box number 6 (like we had with box 3 and 4).

 

I think an Eomer hero is a pretty safe bet at this point, probably leadership. I guess thematically it would make sense to put him into the last box then, but then again he is probably one the most important “supporting characters” so to speak, so I do not think that they will hold him back that long.

 

My second guess would be Tactics Imrahil. I think the original Tactics Beregond would have been perfect here, but I cannot imagine them doing heroes twice in the same sphere. We should definitely get a Tactics heroes and with Eowyn out of the picture he makes the most sense to me.

 

With Hallbarad, Elladan, Elrohir, Merry, Pippin, Bergil, Eowyn, Beregond we have quite a strong line-up for potential line-up. I think they will try to strike a balance between characters not yet represented and those we already have as heroes.  

Denethor isn’t really a hero in the book, so I guess we might get him as an objective ally like Golem. We already have a strong ally and hero version of Faramir. So I cannot see another one.

 

I would love to have the twins, but I cannot see them making the cut – especially since we get their ally version in the new cycle.

 

So my most likely candidates for allies are Hallbarad, Beregond, Eowyn and Bergil.

 

Box 6 should also be a head scratcher. Maybe a spirit Golem (already thought that we might get him in box 3), but can/should they really pull it off. I guess we might see Merry and Pippin allies (spill-over) but apart from that I have no clue.

Putting Beyond All Hope on Gandalf after sacrificing him to kill the Balrog literally is Gandalf the White.

It's not completely out of the question they could make another Gandalf hero to represent him as Gandalf the White, but I think it's very unlikely.

I wouldn't mind seeing a new Gandalf ally to represent Gandalf The White.

Yeah I know, but beyond all hope is not especif for gandalf, its a global hero card especif for a mission in a sequence of missions. A true gandalf the white hero would be amazing, or even a ally. For me the game wont be complete if we dont get a true Gandalf the white card, since he is one of the best characters in the history.

...he's the same character as Gandalf the Grey, just with shinier robes.

Even in the unlikely circumstance that we get a Gandalf specifically intended to represent Gandalf the White, he won't be called Gandalf the White because of how the uniqueness rules work.

Yes, that's precisely what I also think of the prospect for a Gandalf the White card. However, it could still be called Gandalf and represent him as the White in the art, in the ability, maybe higher stats, etc.

What about a Title specifically for Gandalf? I guess you could also attach it to Saruman outside of Saga mode.

In the rulebook for Land of Shadow: "The adventure continues in The Lord of the Rings: The Flame of the West Expansion with scenarios that bring to life the events from the first half of The Return of the King."

That would be really amazing, yes. I created a custom card of this which could be attached to any istari hero (I also made the other wizards).

The confirmation that we'll be getting Fellowship Aragorn in Flame of the West is that Palantír of Orthanc (which you can only get after The Road to Isengard) says "Attach to Fellowship Aragorn."

 

I assume that they'll even out the number of heroes per sphere across the saga, so Flame of the West would have one Tactics hero and one Leadership/Spirit hero, and the sixth box will have one Tactics hero and one Spirit/Leadership hero. I also assume that they won't repeat Core or Saga heroes, though they might break that rule since Flame of the West includes Éowyn's key moment. My guess is that we'll get Tactics Imrahil (the best representative of Gondor on the field of Pelennor) and Spirit Éomer, and in the sixth box we'll get Fellowship Sam, Leadership Frodo, and Tactics Gwaihir. For allies, Merry, Pippin, Halbarad, and either Éowyn (if we don't get a hero version or "Dernhelm"-type attachment) or Beregond seem likely possibilities.

 

In The Grey Havens, we might get a Gondor hero, perhaps FFG-created. The Voice of Isengard had both Rohan and Isengard themes in its player cards. Two of the spoiled ship objectives have the Gondor trait, and the announcement article said:

I'm hoping we get The Flame of the West announcement or another Grey Havens article before Christmas, to find out more.

These are, I think, excellent guesses. With one omission perhaps, why not Denethor? This is his part of the book, or in other words, this is the only part where he actually features, with a chapter named after him. I believe we should see him at least as an ally? But it could also be an objective… or I mean boon and/or burden.

I've been thinking a bit about the structure of box six. I don't think it'd be too farfetched to imagine having two Fellowship heroes: Sam for the first scenario, escaping from Cirith Ungol, with Frodo as an ally objective, then Frodo for the second two. I'd guess that the second and third scenarios would probably be the journey across Mordor (Frodo and Sam, maybe some sort of quest that encouraged Secrecy), and then Mount Doom and the Black Gate, with two separate staging areas. While it'd be nice to have the Scouring of the Shire as the last scenario, I just don't know that it's likely to follow Mount Doom/the Black Gate.

Surely Tactics Éowyn HAS to appear in box five. I'd expect a Leadership Éomer more than a Spirit Éomer, though.

## 49 [NathanH on December 16, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/195926-some-hero-anticipation/?do=findComment&comment=1938732)

The one thing that makes me uncertain about Fellowship Sam in box 6 is that, while Box 3 and presumably Box 5 require that I do not play Frodo Baggins, they do not require that I do not play Samwise Gamgee.

I am inclined to agree. I understand how much the final success depended on Samwise (just as it did on Gollum, and others) but I do not think that will result in a Fellowship Sam.

Very interesting discussion. I'm pretty sure we will have another Ring-bearer hero.

Page 2 of the Blacks Riders manual reads :

 

Future Saga Expansions may include different heroes with the Ring-bearer trait, but for now the players must use Frodo Baggins when playing the scenarios in The Lord of the Rings Saga Expansions.

 

https://images-cdn.fantasyflightgames.com/filer_public/fb/c0/fbc07811-e172-4b29-91a7-0b5cd4cf8150/the-black-riders-rulesheet.pdf [https://images-cdn.fantasyflightgames.com/filer_public/fb/c0/fbc07811-e172-4b29-91a7-0b5cd4cf8150/the-black-riders-rulesheet.pdf]

 

I will be very surprised if no other Hero have the Ring-bearer trait. And Sam Gamgee with ring bearer will be so amazing in term of deck building, and so thematic ! It will make box 1,2,4 and 6 playable with another Ring-Bearer hero. It will give Fordo Hero playable in the Saga!

 

I find Estel Edain guess very interesting too!

 

My guess :

The Flame of The West :

 

Heroes

Aragorn Fellowship

Eomer Spirit

Imrahil tactics

 

Unique allies

Beregond Tactics

Halbarad Leadership

Eowyn Spirit

Denethor Lore

 

Box 6 :

Heroes

Sam Gamgee Fellowship

Fordo Leadership

Gwaihir Tactics

 

Unique allies

 

Meneldor Tactics

Aragorn Leadership

Merry Spirit

Pippin Lore

I think that will be an extra, POD/Fellowship, quest. But the official saga will likely end with the Black Gate/Mount Doom encounter.

This is clever. It might be better to postpone Merry and Pippin for the final box, just like they postponed some characters from box III to IV. Box V seems to be the most packed.
