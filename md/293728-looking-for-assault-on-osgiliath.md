Howdy, friends!

This is unlikely, but I was wondering if anyone had any leads on the Assault on Osgiliath pack? It’s the last one I need to finish that particular cycle. Thanks in advance!

It's a great pack! There are some very nice cards on there for a ranger deck. I love the scenario too! It's one of my favorites! Unfortunately, I have no leads on getting one, however, if my memory serves, it's been I while since that cycle was reprinted; so hopefully soon! I certainly hope so because I need the first two packs to finish the cycle and they've both got some cards that I'd love to have.

It is odd that just Morgul Vale is in the "awaiting reprint" section of FGG,. I really hope that's just an error and that it's supposed to be the entire AP set.

theres a comic book store where i live that sold me this pack for $7 about a month or two ago. They had two but I only bought one, judging from their eagerness to get rid of it I'd say its still there (nobody has even heard of this game where i live). Keep in mind that the ones they are selling are ORIGINAL prints, meaning that they do not have the gold ring borders to distinguish between easy and hard mode (at least the one I got didn't) and they come in a paper box instead of the plastic like the new cycles do.

I don't know it the one I got was an original print, but it had the cardboard box and gold rings.

It isn't a cardboard box, its paper with cardboard inside to protect the cards. I'm 100% sure the outer case is supposed to be paper (thick paper but paper none the less).

Sorry for any confusion, t that consistency (Armada, Legion, Runewars, etc), I use the terms interchangeably
