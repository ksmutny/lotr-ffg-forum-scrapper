I was just curious if there were any promotional cards for this game. I know Fantasy Flight has done some promos for their other games. Thanks!

It's only an art swap though. There are no promo cards that have different rules.

There's a whoooole promo quest if you count the Fog on the Barrow-downs quest that the aforementioned alternate art Aragorn came with!

I assume so, but so far as I know it hasn't been confirmed.

Yes, it was:

FFG: 'Note: The Fog on the Barrow-downs scenario will be made available for purchase at a later date. Playmats and alternate art cards are exclusive to the Fellowship Event and will not be available after the event.'
