Hi Everyone

 

I know this probably has been asked a billion of times already, but I did not find a search function in the forum here and google didn't turn anything up either.

 

Is it possible to have a player action after a card (Treachery) with a "When Revealed:" effect is revealed from the encounter deck?

 

Concrete example: In the Adventure Road to Rivendell I just turned up 'Bitter Wind'. Can I react with Gildor Inglorion to this and search my librabry for a potential "A Test of Will" to cancel the effect?

 

Thank you for your help!

 

By the way: Where is the search function for these forums?

actions can only take place after the effect has taken place. if you want to interrupt a "when revealed" effect then you have to use a response

 

the search bar is right at the the top, by the FFG logo

Ah, thanks, that is what I thought / was afraid of...

 

Thank you, I've found the search bar now. It's a bit embarassing really...I guess I was looking frantically for a button somewhere around the forum section :unsure: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_unsure.png]
