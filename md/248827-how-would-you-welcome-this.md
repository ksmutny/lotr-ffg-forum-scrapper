I feel that if FFG is able to put out a campaign expansionfor a PvP game they should be able to do the same for a coop game. C'mon FFG give us our generic campaign mode!

That would be awesome! They wouldn't necessarly have to put a new quest or even player cards into it, just a ton of boons and a few burdens :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png], so we can play a complete campaign with all quests ^_^ [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_happy.png]

Yeah, this would be absolutely fantastic. Players have wanted this for a long time, and I think it's the next logical step for this game.

It would be a cool way to explore a setting like Rhun without dedicating an entire cycle to it.
