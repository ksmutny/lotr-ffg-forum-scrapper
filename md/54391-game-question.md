I'm a new player. During the Encounter Phase, does exercising the option in step 1 of player engagement to "engage one enemy in the staging area" exhaust a character? I've searched, but couldn't find an answer.

Thanks.

No, you do not exhaust to make the enemy engage you. (but you exhaust to defend or attack)

 Also keep in mind that enemies do not engage characters, they engage players.

Also keep in mind that even if you engage the enemy, any effects that refer to the enemy engaging you (such as Hummerhorns) still applies.

When you engage the enemy the enemy also engages you, and vice versa.

Also remember, even if you optionally engage one enemy, you will still have to do the engagement checks for the remaining enemies in the staging area.
