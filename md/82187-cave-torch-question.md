hi, in the into the pit scenario-can you use the cave torch to put progress on locations in the staging area?  because it doesnt specify on the card. just says to put 3 on a dark location.  if not this scenario seems to be alot higher than dl-5.   and if you can, do you discard them when they meet the progress requirements to do so? thanks

Yeah, cave torch can target locations in the staging area. 

When any location has progress tokens placed on it matching or exceeding its printed number, that location is considered explored and is discarded -- whether or not it is the active location.

Be aware that it can only target Dark locations…
