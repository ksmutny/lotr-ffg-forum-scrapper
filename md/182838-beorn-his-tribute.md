A prominent person in our community has lost one of his heroes.

I am creating this thread out of respect for Dan and his family and my purpose for this being to create a thread full of loving words and thoughts that may strengthen him in this time. His dad brought Dan to us in the start, so I am thankfull for that.

 

I wish my children will write such a beautiful tribute for me one day.

No need to repeat as said below. Just so everybody can pay their respects if they wish.

Thank you for making me aware of this, it has given me the chance to add a comment to the tribute thread. No need to repeat it here, but thank you for the opportunity.
