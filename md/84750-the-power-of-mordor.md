when playing the siege of cair andros, you start with the 3 battleground locations in the staging area.  the power of mordor says count the number of encounter cards in the staging area and shuffle them into the encouter deck.   i assume these battlegrounds qualify as encouter cards?

coincidentally…if i do in fact shuffle the battlegrounds back into the deck, then lets say for example i clear the first quest and proceed to 2a.  during staging the banks is revealed.  later while still on 2b, i manage to clear the banks, do i immediately skip to 3a?

Yes they do.  It's one of the worst things that can happen early in the scenario.
