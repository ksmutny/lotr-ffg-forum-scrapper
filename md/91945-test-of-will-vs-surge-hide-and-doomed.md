Are surge, hide, and doomed considered "when revealed" effects that I can cancel with Test of Will?

No, only text designated with the line that reads "When Revealed" can be canceled with A Test of Will. Â Surge, Hide, Doomed and other keywords only trigger when the card is revealed, but that doesn't make them "When Revealed" text.
