I post this because it is LCG related, not because I think it has any bearing on our beloved game. With Saga Expansions and Deluxe Expansions planned into the future, there is every reason to believe that The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game will continue for many more years. Still, a sad day for fans of the CoC LCG.

As a CoC player I can confirm... I am sad :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

At this point I'd be baffled to hear people still saying the game is dying, but I guess you can never be too sure.

Gutted.

I just hope the online presence of CoC Lcg can be kept alive rather than it fading away as newer games capture peoples time.

At least they are going to reprint the asylum packs

FFG got the rights to the Legend of the 5 Rings card game so maybe they want to shift their focus on their newly acquired IP? I mean they publish so many competitive LCGs, they can only support so many and there has to be some internal competition when it comes to sales (which obviously doesn't affect their only coop LCG).

I really wish I had picked that game up at the beginning instead of catching on to LCGs at the end if its life.

I'd love to see them reboot Call of Cthulhu as a cooperative LCG. FFG has the best Lovecraft-themed games, and the source material really lends itself to cooperative play.

I'd play the heck out of that.

I so agree. The Horrors have too many fiddly bits for me. Make a coop (soloable) and I would buy everything plus the chewing gum.

I can see a Lovecraftian-themed cooperative LCG.  One thing LotR excels at that most co-op games don't, including strong ones like Arkham/Eldritch Horror, is in solitaire play.  I love co-ops, and while I do like to play the bigger games with groups, whenever I just feel the need to play a game in my spare time, its much easier to setup an encounter deck than break out a board, tokens, etc. and shuffle a bunch of different decks up.

R.I.P. :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

 

The fact that it indeed end and not gets a second edition is a sign of it's low popularity :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

Yes yes yes. I would buy everything. I'd buy EVERYTHING. I want a Lovecraftian-themed Co-Op LCG so bad!

That looks REALLY cool, but I think this should be differentiated from the LotR LCG a little more. Both in visual design and basic mechanics. Though I guess the creator/s will do that as this fan-made game is developed. Is there a BGG thread, or a forum thread here, where this is maintained and updated?

Well, I would say it's pretty different. You can't take away that one is based on the other, but however. The BGG thread I have linked seems to be the place where it is currently maintained/updated.
