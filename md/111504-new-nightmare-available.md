I like the shift to selling nightmare packs as groups of 3 (Khazad, and now this). Khazad was cheaper than buying 3 individual packs :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

For Over hill and under hill I do feel that it didn't really need this :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] (Although I will be interested to see if some of the mechanics that some people found annoying like riddle are tweaked a bit).

I can tell you that the riddle mechanic was not touched at all, other than making it more difficult/punishing.

Yeah these nightmare packs seems to be the worst of any released to date to be completely honest.
Riddle mechanic isn't fixed, it's just made even more random and difficult (but not in a good way) and that card in the troll quest that instantly puts you on stage 2 is just insane, that's pretty much a "you lose" card if you get it in the first round or two.

Over Misty Mountains Grim looks pretty good but nothing too special.

 

Nightmare Khazad-Dum is amazing and Dwarrowdelf should be as well, really don't think that Saga nightmare packs work very well......
First off most Saga quests are already pretty hard to begin with, (second hobbit box has some very difficult scenarios and the trolls can be pretty nasty too...) secondly they are already more complex with the extra baggins hero, his resources and interactions with the encounter deck (not to mention they are normally alot more complex simply because they need to be very thematic and similar to the events in the book).

I personally don't think they should do Saga Nightmare....... we have so many quests as it is, I'd MUCH rather nightmare versions of the cycles and expansions instead or at least first not to mention (probably with the exception of Khazad Dum cause its just that good) that I always prefer new quests over just new versions of already existing quests.

To summarize, love nightmare decks but think that there could be a little less focus on them, definitely don't think there should be nightmare versions of Saga and look forward to more nightmare decks that are in an actual cycle and are as good as Seventh level and Into the Pit.

Difficult? It's not difficult. It's random. And nightmare just made odds even less in your favor. The only description that could fit this kind of "difficulty" is artificial difficulty.

It is just a random effect. The forced deck design is stability. There are a few quests like this. Your deck design shouldn't care if it wins on turn 3 or 53. It needs to be able to just sit around at no risk. Easy to build a deck for.

yeah the riddle mechanic really is the worst one so far, completely based on luck.

If it's random and the odds are against you then that is a difficulty, If you random badly it can become impossible to win. 

I don't see why you would consider this not a difficulty? It's just not one that you can mitigate. You can however still build a deck that is more likely to overcome the randomness (a deck that can last a long time, dealing with all the optional riddles as non-riddles for instance, a deck that's mono-colour and mono-cost ect.).

It's pretty similar to the difficulty of any quests in the game really. The same things you need to do in your skill of playing and deck building.

I don't think the nightmare decks take away from design of new quests though, so I don't think it's a problem that we're getting these. I just think that some quests are 'already' hard even for the card pool and it would be better to focus nightmare expansions on the older quests that can't compete with players.

Does it add boons like in the new saga?

You should feel honored, I've read your full post.

 

Now, if you would read my full post yourself, you'll find that the thing you describe is an "artifical" difficulty, which is always, ALWAYS, a bad thing.

 

And comparing this to the regular quest is just nuts. You can find tons of solutions for most of regular quest. Many different types and kinds of combinations. That's a natural difficulty. In riddle-****, you need to build for it exclusively or have a really lucky run, which is an artificial difficulty. 

 

No, it obviously doesn't.

Artificial difficulty is still difficulty. Making the odds less in your favor is by definition making it more difficult.

I'm all for difficult quests, but these look to be pretty extreme, especially for the solo player one hand. I enjoy many of the nightmare scenarios, but for a few of them the difficulty is increased beyond what a solo deck can handle at this point. From reading the description of this set, that seems very likely. I ordered them anyway (completist gene), and I'll see how it goes, but I am a little terrified even to try.

but is that a bad thing? I would rather the nightmares be impossible than beatable 3/5 times. The card pool si going to grow and our decks are going to get more and more powerful. They should be hard and MUCH harder than some of the packs have been. They need to speak to the future, the future player pool.

This is probably a whole other topic, but I know that many people hate the riddle mechanic and I'm not exactly fond of it myself. My question has always been: what would have been better? That's not a rhetorical question either. I'm genuinely interested in trying to figure out what a better mechanic would have been to represent the riddles, which is a really difficult part of the story to model in this game. Any ideas?

Some good articles about difficulty :

http://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/articles/a-look-at-luck-in-game-design--gamedev-14195 [http://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/articles/a-look-at-luck-in-game-design--gamedev-14195]

Both are good overview of skill vs luck, this is the main point of the riddle, they are purely luck and no skill

http://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/articles/hard-mode-good-difficulty-versus-bad-difficulty--gamedev-3596 [http://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/articles/hard-mode-good-difficulty-versus-bad-difficulty--gamedev-3596] => "artificial" and "designed" are not taken with the same definition as the one trololo used. In this article, the randomness is a "designed" difficulty because it is a choice of the designer to have that as a difficulty, whereas is it "artificial" difficulty for trololo as it is random-based and not scaled with skill.

 

How to make riddle better ?

 

Remove the "or gollum make an immediate attack against bilbo" cards, those are nuts in multiplayer game. Thanks for ruining the game Nightmare mode...

 

Better scale the difficulty of cards. You have to draw 2 per player, so cards are either bad or insanly strong to force you to answer the riddle.

One way could have been to have all card with riddle, very strong and keep the 1 card per player.

 

Reduce the luck factor by softening the lose part : remove a counter if you lose or take 1 damage on a hero / exhaust a hero  to draw another cards. Don't amplify it with "name a card title"... Thanks for ruining the game Nightmare mode...

Thanks for the article links!

 

Interesting ideas, alogos. Perhaps there could have been a kind of time mechanic with time removed when you can't "solve" a riddle. This would have fit with the story as well, with Bilbo only having a certain amount of time to solve each riddle.

 

Sparked by some of the newer quest mechanics we've seen, they also could have gotten rid of the existing riddle mechanic entirely and gone with a set of objective or quest cards to represent the riddles from the book. Then each objective or quest could have had some condition to fill and a certain forced effect while it was the current riddle. I'm not sure exactly what that would look like, but potentially more satisfying.

## 20 [booored on July 24, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/111504-new-nightmare-available/?do=findComment&comment=1168747)

I do not get the riddle hate. All you need is a best designed to deal with it and your good. The riddle mechanism is basically just a stall. All you need is a deck that can win on any amount of turns a VERY stable one. This isn't a hard goal to design a deck for.

As for difficulty, look at it this way.

Rolling a dice is not "hard"... but rolling a 1 is a 1/6 chance. There is nothing you can do to make that chance smaller, the "difficulty" can not be altered by skill and it is NOT difficult to roll a die.. rolling a die is easy. That is the difference between difficulty and randomness. Rolling a 4 with a 4d6 is a harder roll, but not harder to do, as rolling a dice is still just dropping them.

So... is rolling the 4 dice difficult, or is it just a difficult roll. It is a difficult roll. It is not difficult.

I don't think people complain about the riddles because they're hard, but more so because they pretty much require a specific deck type. You can build a deck type to beat the riddles fairly reliably, but usually players don't respond too well to quests that force them into one specific mold of building decks.

## 23 [booored on July 25, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/111504-new-nightmare-available/?do=findComment&comment=1168959)

Yeah, but that makes little sense to me. Building decks is probably one of the things I like best about the game. I make so many decks often for a single scenario, once I get a high win ratio I'll play it for fun vs others, but the main thing is deck building. I think quests with unique things are really good for the game.

I'm building decks anyway, what difference does it make if I build a deck for that quest?

## 24 [Tracker1 on July 25, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/111504-new-nightmare-available/?do=findComment&comment=1169014)

I once beat the riddle quest with a deck that had all 1 cost cards, since I was so annoyed with guessing wrong it was an easy solution. Not a hard quest with a deck like that.

We're on firmer footing now, but back in the early days that kind of meta-gaming was necessary sometimes. I'm cool with it once every few years.

For the record, I disagree with the sentiment that saga expansions shouldn't get Nightmare Mode. I can't wait for Black Riders NM... Even if I get my @$$ kicked.

## 26 [MyNeighbourTrololo on July 25, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/111504-new-nightmare-available/?do=findComment&comment=1169296)

When I play most of regular quests, I build in a large box of choices, strategies and stuff. 

 

If I want to play and win riddle quest or something like this, I'm forced to build in a little-little box with almost no choices to it, compared to regular.

 

That's the difference. I like to build my decks for myself rather than quest building them for me.

 

P.S.: What makes it even worse, the riddle quest is a part of campaign. Being forced to completely rebuild your deck from scratch in the middle of a campaign is a bit of ball-kicker.

In France, we mostly play in group, our community is quite large, and we usually end up playing 3 or 4 players.

When you draw 6 or 8 cards, you are bound to fail riddle, and when we played Nightmare, we had 3 lost on the first turn, before ending the staging because of that. Mono sphere deck didn't help, and having only one card type or one cost type is not possible in all sphere and not recommended if you want to win after the riddle... so yes, our table was the most unlucky one, and we resign redoing it after 3 trial. Other tables (see http://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/99517-national-event-parisfrance-june-1st-2014/ [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/99517-national-event-parisfrance-june-1st-2014/]) had serious luck and even succeed in the "name a title" riddle. Then they fail one easy riddle, using all ressources, followed by "discard 2 ressource or gollum make an attack", THE END. That's all, glorious luck, then no luck. No strategy, no deckbuilding nothing could have prevent this (unless 4 player with insane draw and 3 test of will with 3 dwarven tomb and 3 book of Eldacar... maybe ).

Better play snake and ladder, it is waaaaay better and cheaper if I want to roll difficult dice. Collectible Card Game should not be about rolling difficult dice.

I think is a bit lame to build up specific decks against specific quest. Most of the time you will win for sure and there is no surprises as well. For me deck building is like normal or nightmare. But idea if my decks to play against ant quest in right category

I don't really care if the riddle quest is difficult or easy or what. What I do care about is that it is FUN. I know that is subjective, but this quest is not fun for my group. Yes you can just build a specific deck with like all 1 cost red cards or something stupid and win most riddles (well, maybe not now with some of these nightmare mode cards) but it's a pain. And it's a deck that can't even be used practically for any other quests.

 

My group usually has 2 or 3 or sometimes 4 players and we all bring our decks and play a quest and then move to a new one and then another, etc. But then when we get to this quest it would throw everything off if we all delay to just build new decks for this one quest. So what ends up happening is that we just usually skip the whole Hobbit saga quests altogether because who wants to only do PART of the Hobbit saga? Which is a shame.

 

Just a really poorly designed quest in my opinion because of this.

You can build a deck type to beat the riddles fairly reliably, but usually players don't respond too well to quests that force them into one specific mold of building decks.

I agree, but would then add that it is not only the fact that it forces a specific deck build, but also that it really still isn't a fun mechanic once the decks are built (and i have a hard time saying that because I do enjoy that quest every once in a while). Journey to Rhosgobel is a quest that sorta forces a unique build as well but it is a fun quest and has fun elements to it that go beyond randomness. I think the Riddle quest just falls too far into a random guessing game and not a strategic card game, even though you can reduce the randomness it still is just guessing. 

 

As an aside, however, I have no idea how the designers could have gone about the riddle part of the story differently, so I can't complain too much. Does anybody else have an idea about how the riddles could have been made more fun?

While not a good example, unique location of The Watcher in the Water comes to mind. I don't remember it making my hade ache as riddles did.

It's not even that the Riddle mechanic idea itself is super horrible. It's the penalties you get for failing these random tests.

 

Reduce the penalties for such a random thing and it wouldn't be so bad or unfun. Like if it was just taking progress off or delaying you in some way or still plinking poor Bilbo but for only like 1 damage and he has a couple more health, etc.

 

Instead the penalties for failure are so bad that you probably lose the game for failing 2 riddles and there are so many riddles in the encounter deck that this loss usually happens by turn 2.
