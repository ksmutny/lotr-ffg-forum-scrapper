# [Question about Adventure Pack Cycle&#039;s](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126298-question-about-adventure-pack-cycles/)

Every Cycle include several Adventure pack's .

 

My Question's are now:

 

For example when i have not in the "Shadows of Mirkwood " Cycle the "Hunt for Gollum" Adventure pack can i play the other Packs in this cycle without any Problem?

 

What did i miss when i have not the first pack " The hunt for Gollum" ?

 

 

Problem is that it seems so that this pack is not possible to buy in Germany at the moment neither the german nor the english Version. Till now i was thinking that every Adventure pack adds a new stage to the scenario of the cycle.

 

Thanks

All you missed is a hero, a bunch of player cards and a quest. They're not directly connected to anything, so you won't have any problem.

Each adventure pack only requires the core set and the deluxe box released just before the adventure pack cycle. In the case of the Shadows of Mirkwood cycle, it's just the core set that you need. No adventure packs are dependent on any other adventure packs, even though the packs are designed to provide one large story.

Like everyone else has said, all you really lose is a hero card, some player cards, and of course the quest. You might lose out on the story being out of line or weirdly paced because you're missing a part of the story, but it's not that big of a loss, especially in the older adventure packs.

 

The Hunt for Gollum is getting reprinted at least in english, so hopefully in other languages as well. It's been hard to find on my end for awhile now.

Starting with Against the Shadow, the designers have tried to link the scenarios more thematically (with a continuous story), but even then the packs are still playable out of order.

To be honest I dont really like idea when we cannot use some heroes un certain scenarios like Blood of Gondor or Morgul Vale and Fight at Isen. Some decks just suffer. Hope ffg dont do it anymore.

I see some players play Grima hero and Objective Grima ally also was there but no one wonna change the Hero since deck is build up around him. That quite stupid situation but designers bring players that way to make that rules for adventures packs. Hope they will not do it anymore
