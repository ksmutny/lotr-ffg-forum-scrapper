I'm stoked for this! A great playmat!

Forget the playmat. It's alt-art Galadriel!

Woo! I think I'm going to prefer the original Galadriel artwork (it's hard to beat Magali) but that playmat is fantastic.

Say what you will about their lack of communication and super sparse news updates/articles, but hot **** do they deliver on their art choices for playmats.   Yes it's hard to beat Magali, but from what I can see of this card, it's pretty spectacular as well.  but I too am most excited for that playmat!

When it says only available in 2017 at *etc* does it mean it will be widely available other places in 2018..... or ....... that it is only available in 2017 and only at those places? ?

Best news today! The playmat is gorgeous and Galadriel full art will see so much play in my table <3 

The best part of it? My partner looked at the playmat and said "I want that!" So I'll have the chance to play more with her :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

The alt art card and playmat are exclusive to the Fellowship event, but the quest will be available as a Print on Demand quest later I'm sure. That's what they have done for every quest up til now, no reason to change it this year. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I did think that, but found it curious with the wording :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] Past couple of times I think they had specifically mentioned "available later on" type statements (I think)

Are the playmats good quality or at least comparable to what's sold by FFG at retail?

Comparable.

Don't worry. I'm sure they'll be widely available on eBay at very reasonable prices...

Yea, it just lets us know it isn't going on retail sale before 2018.  And yea, the mats have been of varying degrees of quality - in terms of thickness - but the print themselves has always been really good for the ones I've seen.

Nope... those alternate art cards don't do it for me : the text is too small, icons are all over the place, and you play one alt. art hero with regular art heroes, it looks like a card from another game. It's a matter of taste...

And the playmat?

Now, that playmat (or Playmap :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]) is amazing!!!!

One of this problem can be corrected by having all the hero in alternate art :p.

I stole from you the word playmap ^^

Now THAT'S the only way I'll refer to this accessory from now on :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

How much money does the fellowship stuff usually go for? Never been to one of these events before and all that stuff looks great!

Talk to your FLGS about ordering one (or more) today and they can price it out for you.

As far as I remember it was around 25 euro in my area. It could give you an idea ;).

Reached out to them now, thanks for the info and advice y'all:)

## 24 [Hawkman2000 on September 22, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/258655-assault-on-dol-guldur-fellowship-event-kits/?do=findComment&comment=2993427)

Reached out to a local store, but they haven't run LOTR LCG in the past and don't seem interested. I might try one other store but if that's a no-go, I might have to stalk eBay for a reasonable price. 

Hopefully with three mats per kit, the price won't be too bad. Weren't previous kits only one mat per?

Before 2016, kits were 4 per I believe.

As far I remember before 2015 there was only one playmat, so we need to determine who win it at event. Not a cooperative thing. Since there is the same number of scenario and playmat in every kit I see.
