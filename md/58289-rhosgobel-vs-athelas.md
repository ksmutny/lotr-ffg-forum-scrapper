A question that came up during Juicebox's tournament:

 

Is it possible to heal Wilyador with Athelas in stage 3B when Rhosgobel is still in the staging area? My guess is that Rhosgobel's card text prevails, so that no healing is possible, even if quest card 3B says so.

i would say this is correct, otherwise it would be easy to abuse this rule and win quickly

from the card text....

"While Rhosgobel is in the staging area, Wilyador cannot be healed."

What I thought (but then sometimes what I think is somehow not according to ther rules).

 

Thanks to both of you!

 Rhosgobel must be out of the staging area, and unless some other card kicks it out of the current location area, will end up being explored in order to put the 12 quest tokens on stage 2b.  In other words, pretty much eveerybody should always have 4 victory points at least at the end of this scenario.
