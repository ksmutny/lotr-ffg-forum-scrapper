A quick question has come up.  Can you pay for Winged Guardian's forced trait by using Elrond's resource trait?

 

Winged Guardian: After an attack which Winged Guardian defends resolves, Pay 1 [Tactics] resource or discard Winged Guardian.

 

 

Elrond: You may spend resources from Elrond's resource pool to pay for [spirit], [Leadership], and [Tactics] allies.

 

 

^ my issue is that the wording on Elrond is a bit vague.

Elrond's text states:

"You may spend resources from Elrond's resource pool to pay for [spirit], [Leadership], and [Tactics] allies."

 

It does not state that his resources are spirit, tactics, or leadership resources, just that his lore resources can be used to pay for allies of any sphere. 

 

With this in mind, Elrond cannot be used to pay for Winged Guardian's ability. Any card effect that that requires a certain type of non-Lore resource cannot be the target of Elrond's ability.

That explains it.  It's sometimes hard for me NOT to read into things that aren't there.

 

Thanks, much.
