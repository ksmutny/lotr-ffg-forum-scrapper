Hi all, I'm in the process of editing one of my two decks and have tentatively put x3 copies of For Gondor in my leadership/tactics deck as the +1 attack for all characters is pretty epic plus almost all allies in the deck have the gondor trait so the defensive buff is quite nice also.

Two questions though:

1) I play two handed and want to know if For Gondor gives +1 attack to all characters on the other team as well as the deck that plays it, I'm assuming that it does...

2) If I have Steward of Gondor on someone giving them the Gondor trait will they get the defense boost as well? Or are they not a gondor "character" simply a character with the gondor trait?

Sorry if these are stupid questions, I'm pretty positive both questions are a yes but just want to make 100% sure... cause if not I won't be including it. Thanks in advance! =)

Yep, For Gondor! boosts attack all allies and heroes for every player.  And defense for every Gondor character on the table.  Steward of Gondor will indeed enable a hero to benefit from that defense boost as well.  And throw down Mutual Accord to give that benefit to every Rohan character as well!

Awesome!!! My new deck build seems pretty awesome then, lets hope it actually is when I start using it later!

Thanks Grandspleen!
