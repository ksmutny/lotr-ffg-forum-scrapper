I am going to finish this 'great' (really, it is my best fanmade, i think) work. Only i need know if the english words and grammar (i'm spanish) are correct.

 

Could you see and say if there is any error in the english text? Thanks...

How long have you been doing this :o [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_ohmy.png]

It is awesome! But IMO this is too easy. 1 quest with 7 quest points :/

I love those cards with weak stats, sneaky effects and surge. I also really like locations adding enemies. Every card has awesome idea.

Great work!

If only FFG used this art instead of rejected videogame concept art! Didn't pay attention to the abilities but these cards look so pretty! Especially the locations.

It seems easy, but not is certainly easy. Very dificult to kill each hero 2 orcs. And no allies. In fact, the most dificult is really place 7 progress tokens on the quest card.

I would say that the dificult level is: 6 (between 1-7)

Dude that is some sweet art.  Love the Orc Camps and the DG Explorers.  That's a lot of different cards. 35 of them.  No way all them have x3 copies in the Encounter Deck am I right?  Do you have a deck list for the encounter deck?  That would be nice to see if you have already made one.  

 

Thanks

I am creating a sheet file, but before i want to know if all the english text is correct. In the sheet will be displayed how many copies of each card are included in the encounter deck, and in the Orcs of Dark Forest deck.

1. On Marauder Hills, if the enemy is a group of orcs then it can say "If marauder hills damage a character..." but if it is just a single guy you are fighting which is what it seems like to me due to just 1 orc on the picture, then it must say "If Marauder hills damages a character....."

 

2.

0we6.jpg [http://imageshack.us/a/img31/7581/0we6.jpg]

 

It should read instead "If a shadow card with a shadow effect hasn't been dealt to an attacking Orc enemy during combat, deal to that enemy an additional shadow card until dealing him a shadow card with an effect.

 

got to go but will do more if I have time later.

This is awesome!!

I admit I didn't check everything, since I have to work. I check the cards in the first post. Here are a couple of hints:

 

Archaic Find

When revealed: Attach this card to the hero...

Response: ...remove all progress tokens from the attached hero...

 

Dol Guldur Explorer's

The shadow text is introduced with "Sombra" instead of "Shadow:"

 

Hunter

You have to replace some Spanish here, too. "y" instead of "and" and "Sombra" instead of "Shadow"

 

Maybe someone else can check the rest, good luck finishing this outstanding work :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

## 17 [Khamul The Easterling on December 5, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/94572-orc-hunting-fanmade/?do=findComment&comment=923720)

The words underlined         are the ones that need to be added.

 

Beorning Stream 

 

7gl7.jpg [http://imageshack.us/a/img14/1335/7gl7.jpg]

 

After Traveling to Beorning stream, the first player may choose 1 Dark Forest location from the staging area.  X is the number the first player decides.

 

5c8u.jpg [http://imageshack.us/a/img35/8903/5c8u.jpg]

 

After traveling to Carrock Road, the first player choose 1 location from the staging area..... 

I see quite a few cards with the same mistake as the one above.  So put "the" before "first player" and "staging area" on any other cards that have that mistake.

 

 

In abrupt undergrouth it says  "x is the double amount of players in the game." Take out the first "the" so it reads "x is double the amount.......

 

 

tgxs.jpg [http://imageshack.us/a/img855/4460/tgxs.jpg]

 OK, so there needs to be a comma after "Combat Phase"  

And put a "the" before the attack symbol and I think the last 14 words should be rephrased.  I would say "....higher than the total (Willpower) of all ready characters in play, the discarded card engages the first player.

 

Will do more later.

About Archaic Find i corrected the first error. However, the second i think this is not an error: therer are several cards that talk about "attached hero" and not "the attached hero": Self Preservation [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/core/self-preservation-core], Great Yew Bow [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/the-hobbit/on-the-doorstep/great-yew-bow-otd]...

Abrupt Underground last version:

 

41ew.jpg [http://img21.imageshack.us/img21/4153/41ew.jpg]

 

I added the 'the' in all locations (After traveling to X, THE first player...; choose a X location from THE staging area), and last phrase: X is double of the number of players in the game.

 

And 'THE first players decides' of Beorning Stream is also corrected:

I don't understand this card.  Do other people understand this?

 

 

hyy2.jpg [http://imageshack.us/a/img855/6862/hyy2.jpg]

you misspelled other by saying ohter.

 

 

6i3h.jpg [http://imageshack.us/a/img96/8215/6i3h.jpg]

I would say in the last sentence "...other Orc enemy in play that is not another copy of Orc Patrol"

 

7phm.jpg [http://imageshack.us/a/img14/1200/7phm.jpg]

add an "s" to the word damage.  So it reads "damages".   

 

That's all I could find.  Great job on the quest.  Who knows how the quest works but the cards look great.

Rising Storm's meaning:

It forces to you to remove progress tokens from quest card.

The first idea: you have to remove 2 progress tokens.

...but sometimes: you have more progress tokens on the quest card than it is required. For example, this quest card: you only need 7 progress tokens, but sometimes, you can place more than 7prog. So this treacherie wouldn't be bad. The treachery forces to you, first: remove progress tokens that you have more than 7. And after: remove 2 more. So the quest card would have: 5 progress tokens.

The initial quest card flvour text is a little awkward to read and could do with some refining.

 

http://imageshack.us/a/img822/5554/9w52.jpg [http://imageshack.us/a/img822/5554/9w52.jpg]

 

The Proof of the Dark Forest - This implies that they are looking for proof that the dark forest exists!  I would change this to something like "The Trial of the Dark Forest"

 

The flavour text:

 

A valiant hero, before fighting and proving worthy to lead his army, must first venture into the depths of the Dark Forest.

 

the next bit confuses me and I don't quite get what you are trying to say

 

and resist cleaning the forest without orc undergrowth during a given period of time.

 

do you mean something like:

 

There he must risk clearing the forest of orc undergrowth within a set period of time.

How about this?  You could make this treachery nastier in the following way:

 

When Revealed: Remove two progress tokens from the current quest.  Then, if there are seven or more progress tokens remaining, remove all progress tokens from the current quest.

 

 

That would remove 2 progress tokens no matter what, and if you have built up more progress than is necessary, it will wipe out all of your progress.  7 progress is not such a huge number, so it isn't devastating to lose them (especially if you are still hunting, anyway), but could create for an interesting 'balancing act' when questing if you're trying to anticipate this card.

And it makes more sense.  To me at least.

## 28 [Mndela on December 7, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/94572-orc-hunting-fanmade/?do=findComment&comment=925109)

Good idea, but this card would change all the original idea of the Orc Hunting. The principal idea is 'hunting' orcs, engage a lot of orcs and fighting them. With this card, you must take a lot of care about the questing face.

 

Maybe, the treachery could force to each player to remove 2 progress tokens from characters he control (and not from the quest card). I want to think (my idea is maybe very easy, but the idea of GranSpleen is too hard)...

 

Well then, anyway, can anyone correct the original text?:

When revealed: Remove all excess progress tokens of the actual quest card. Then, remove 2 progress tokens of the actual quest card.

## 29 [GrandSpleen on December 7, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/94572-orc-hunting-fanmade/?do=findComment&comment=925300)

For that effect, I would write:

 

When Revealed: If there are more than 7 progress tokens on the current quest, remove progress tokens until there are 5 remaining.

 

 

(5 because the card has 7 progress, and 7 minus 2 more = 5).

## 30 [Mndela on December 7, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/94572-orc-hunting-fanmade/?do=findComment&comment=925320)

Ok, thanks

But i also want to remove progress if player(s) has not 7 progress or more . So 2nd phrase is necesary. Could the final text be so?:

When Revealed: Remove 2 progress tokens on the current quest, if able. Then, if there are more than 5 progress tokens on the current quest, remove progress tokens until there are 5 remaining.

## 31 [GrandSpleen on December 8, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/94572-orc-hunting-fanmade/?do=findComment&comment=925460)

Yeah, that should work.  I would change the first part to "Remove 2 progress tokens from the current quest, if able."  That's all.
