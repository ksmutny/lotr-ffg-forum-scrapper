The Massing at Osgiliath and The Battle of Lake-Town…which i wont buy.


"The Watcher in the Water" is the only small expansion deck i v bought because of this card:

I hope FFG could make more cards of this kind, its so pretty :-)

those two are not proper packs and have no player cards…there is however:

dunedain watcher

west road traveller

pelargir emmissary  (in HoN)

imladris stargazer

and i have a feeling the new gondor cycle will bring more female characters to us

i said this last time you brought it up, but i guess my point remains- tolkiens world doesnt have many women, and ffg is creating his world, and only adding in their own things piece by piece…i suppose that doesnt stop them from making unnamed characters women, but in a world where women were not warriors (with obvious exceptions) i think it would not follow lore to have too many female fighters…..again this doesnt stop them having female characters in other roles so i guess you do have a point

be patient and i think you shall get your wish gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]

I think that Rosy Cotton has bigger "balls" than many male fighters ;-)    And Lobelia… Och boy… I would not like to be hers enemy!

But yeah, there are not so many strong female characters in LOTR, but I can still remember guite many that we may see in future expansions!

haha - yeah, you dont want to anger lobelia- im very much looking forward to her

on that note i think that when we see hobbits, which is hopefully soon, then i think we shall get more female cards….im not sure why i think that, i just feel that it will be about time to see some proper female characters, and not just the female version of a male ally (what i mean by this is dunedain watcher- she could have been male without any changing of her character)….i want to see some stand out girls in the game….,which contradicts my first post about lore etc….but the point stands…..there are some great female characters in middle earth- its just a matter of waiting gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]

 Yeah,couldn't wait for Galadriel,the most powerful ally,and whatever effects this card has,it should add 'when Galadriel is in play,Gimli gets +2 willpower'gran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif]
