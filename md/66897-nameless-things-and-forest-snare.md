Nameless Thing attaches player cards to itself.

Forest Snare has the text "Attached enemy cannot attack."

I can't see any reason why a Forest Snare that is attached to Nameless Thing by the effect on NT wouldn't thus ensnare the Nameless Thing and prevent it from attacking. Seems a bit crazy though.

When you attach player cards to Elder Thing, attach them upside-down thus only their costs are visible. This way you'll see all information you need without questions like this coming up. 

## 3 [jjeagle on July 2, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/66897-nameless-things-and-forest-snare/?do=findComment&comment=652810)

But my point is that there is no basis in the rules to do what you have suggested, or any basis in the rules (I think) to believe that the cards attached to NT are out of play in any other respect beyond their cost.

## 4 [MyNeighbourTrololo on July 2, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/66897-nameless-things-and-forest-snare/?do=findComment&comment=652817)

That makes no sense. Cards are attached to Elder Things only because of their cost, to create a randomness of their parameters.

Any other interaction with attached cards would be invalid, because cards are attached not as attachments. 

## 5 [jjeagle on July 2, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/66897-nameless-things-and-forest-snare/?do=findComment&comment=652827)

It makes perfect sense in rules terms - there is no basis to distinguish between the state of being attached to Nameless Thing as a result of NT's text, and the state of being attached to Nameless Thing as a result of being played as an attachment in the Planning phase.

I am certain this is not the designers' intent, and I certainly think it is a silly situation, but that is a different point.

Wow, that's a good catch. I agree, rulewise the enemy should not be able to attack. Also it makes sense thematically as it's a trap. Yes, a forest trap in the undergound, I hear you,  but hey - I don't mind!

## 7 [MyNeighbourTrololo on July 2, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/66897-nameless-things-and-forest-snare/?do=findComment&comment=652911)

It makes no sense in terms of game rules.

Attachment card types are attached during the planning phase by the player.

Player cards from player deck are attached to Elder Things when they engage, and by sharing the same word "attach" - it's a completely diffrent mechanic, attaching all - events, attachments, allies. And in this mechanic card text doesn't matters, the only thing that matters is cost.

Only the player is restricted to the planning phase when playing attachments. The encounter deck isn't.

 

Example: "Caught in a Web". Counts as an attachment, is attached during the quest phase.

 

The  card text of Forest Snare gives no limitation either. It just says "Attach to an enemy engaged with a player. Attached enemy cannot attack." All these requirements are fullfilled when a Nameless Thing's forced action triggers. I still have no clue if this was intended or not. After all Imladris Stargazer gives the player a good chance to actually trap one of these monsters with Forest Snare.

These are all valid points and shows another example of bad use of wording by the designers.  I will be e-mailing for an answer as they replied last time very quickly, but I would be very surprised if the obvious answer wasn't correct.  Cards placed on these 'Nameless Things' - better word than 'attached' - only count their 'cost' value.  Any cards attached as normal 'Attachments' don't add their 'cost', only their effect.  That sounds reasonable, but it will be up to the players to remember which are which.  Attaching top/bottom looks the best.  Cheers!

I speak - they don't listen.

Cards from the deck are attached not as the attachment card type. It's a diffirent mechanic and it has nothing to do with card text. It's something like facedown players cards considered as 1 atk 1 def 1 hp orcs in escape from the Dol Guldur.

Not really. FAQ (1.23) Attachments: "Any card that attaches to another card is treated as an Attachment in addition to its other card types."

So to use a word like "place" or to add a sentence like "attached cards are considered out of play" would have been beter. But it's pretty obvious that the text box of player cards should be blanked or inactive or something else.

As Pete already pointed out, an attached card is always an attachment. That's fool proof logic btw. Hell, the Nameless Things' card text explicitely states that these cards are attached to it, so why on earth shouldn't they be attachments? And once they're "attached", the "when attached…" bit of Forest Snare triggers as long as nothing else explictely prevents that from happening. Like "cards text are blank" or "Chuck Norris once escaped a Forest Snare" or something like that.

 This discussion is not about making your life easier.

Neither is it about the possible intention of the game designer.

It is just about rules as written. That's all.

Citadel Plate reads: "… Attached hero gets +4 Hit Points."

So it is not applicable to the Nameless Thing.  But it is another case in Forest Snare, so I think we need an official ruling/errata here.

Official ruling would be obvious. This thread is just a silly attempt to justify disabling the Nameless things when it got Forest Snare from the deck accidently.

I started the thread, and I don't think this is a fair comment. I acknowledged that I thought (a) the situation was silly, and (b) the designer's intent was (probably) obvious. It is legitimate, not "silly", to highlight rules loopholes and problems with card design/templating.

Thats why you guys keep defending the method of disabling the Nameless One by feeding Forest Snare into him?

Yes - we are going by what the rules say and what the cards say.

You are going by what you think the rules should be, and how you think the designers intended these cards to interact.

You are probably right in your assessment of the designers' intent, but designer intent cannot be the basis for rules judgements - the designers need to issue an errata (something on the lines of: "cards attached to Nameless Thing are considered to have their text boxes blanked"), and all will be well.

this.

As it currently stands Forest Snare works on those Nameless things. Just because everybody (including you, me or jjeagle) thinks that it is meant to be different, doesn't actually change the facts at all.

## 21 [leptokurt on July 4, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/66897-nameless-things-and-forest-snare/?do=findComment&comment=653783)

Yeah, it's probably silly, at least that's what I thought initially. But the more I think of it, the more I like the idea of a Nameless Thing snaring itself by feeding of the fellowship's fear. Like if the fear would be mirrored back to the thing.

Would be a reason to use Forest Snare again after such a long time.

Sorry everyone but I have been away.  No reply from FFG this time about my enquiry.  I have just tried again.  Anyone else tried?

Although I see all the arguments are valid, I am still going with the obvious until I officially hear differently.  Cards added to Nameless - this is the word they should of used - only county cost and not text.  Attachments played on Nameless only count text and not cost.  This should stop any ambiguities arising from other cards and not just Forest Snare.  If I get a reply from FFG I will post.  Cheers!

I got my reply from FFG this morning and it surprised me.  I believe it will cause a lot more questions, but this is what Caleb stated:-

The word 'attached' was deliberate as many other rules relate to Attachments.  If Forest Snare is played as an Attachment on a Nameless creature it will add its 'cost' to the enemy as well.

He didn't specify the reverse, but it looks like ANY card attached to a Nameless creature either as an Attachment or through its or other cards effects, will add its cost and apply its ability if appropriate.  Obviously cards that affect Heroes, Dwarves, Allies etc., wont affect an enemy but others may.  Let us hope this doesn't lead to more problems.  I think jjeagle has had clarification about a Hero being attached to a Nameless thing.  I shall now have to start playing this method and see what effects it has.  Cheers!

I must admit, I'm somewhat surprised. The ruling makes sense given a strict reading of all the relevant cards and rules text, but I would have predicted some kind of errata/clarification in order to prevent players from getting a "free" Forest Snare. I kind of like the FFG response--it reinforces consistent terminology and sets up a thematic "sprung trap" scenario--but it's certainly unexpected.

This ruling also surprises me. I am trying to think of other implications.

For example: a Dwarf ally that became attached to Nameless Thing would still be an ally (therefore character) by the FAQ ("Any card that attaches to another card is treated as an Attachment in addition to its other card types.") Therefore, it would still give a boost to Erebor Battle Master, for instance.

Another more absurd point that springs to mind: if Gleowine (say) becomes attached to a Nameless Thing, what will stop me from exhausting him to draw a card? Gleowine is in play, I still control him, and I don't think any explicit rules principle states that I can no longer use the action printed on him in this situation. Someone please tell me this is wrong!

PS I did receive official responses to a few other FOS questions which I have posted in a separate thread.

I somehow expected that to come, and I'm not too worried about Forest Snare actually working that way. But jjeagle made a good point how this ruling might lead to rather absurd situations. However, if my intrepretation was correct allies would turn into attachments when attached to Nameless Thing, so Gléowine would deifinitely loose his action, but a dwarf might stll boost Erebor Battle Master. That's why I'd prefer to blank the text of an attached card and be done with it without further complications.

Thanks for asking, Rashley and jjeagle!

Well, both are predicated upon control of the cards attached to a Nameless Thing; the Battle Master is boosted by each Dwarf you control, while effects like that on Gleowine may be triggered by the card's controller (p.23 of the rulebook). 

According to p.25 of the rules, a player maintains control of the cards he or she owns unless another player or the encounter deck "takes control of the card through a game effect." One might argue that the Nameless Things have a de facto "control" over the cards attached to them, but this seems like a shaky line of reasoning considering other examples of changing control (e.g., Wandering Took, Rider of the Mark) explicitly mention the transition in question. Since the Nameless Things don't explicitly "take control" of the cards attached to them, and since players maintain an antecedent right of control, the assumption must be that players indeed control all player cards--allies, attachments, and events--attached to said enemies. 

As you pointed out, this conclusion might have some significant ramifications. We don't have to worry about events--those must be played from a player's hand, which is obviously impossible when they are attached to a Nameless Thing--and most attachments apart from Forest Snare won't have any practical effect. But allies represent a gigantic can of worms. Apart from their abilities, what's stopping you from using those allies to quest, defend, or attack? Per the FAQ, they are attachments in addition to being characters; being attached does not strip them of their ally designation. They are in play, and, as I have suggested above, there's little reason to suppose that you wouldn't control them. This could lead to the ultimate absurdity: using an ally attached to a Nameless Thing to defend against that Nameless Thing, destroying the ally--and, consequently, the Nameless Thing's attack/health.

Now, I am as great a proponent of strict textual interpretation as any person on this forum. But having jumped headlong into the theoretical rabbit hole, it strains credulity to believe FFG intended players to use attached allies in this manner. I expect we'll see a ruling that the Nameless Things gain control of the cards attached to them. Forest Snare would still work, and that would avoid all of the messy situations we continue to conceive.

Hmmh, the answer to jjeagles first question states that an attached hero is not counted as a hero, because he wasn't brought back as a hero. Perhaps the same applies to allies?

 This game… or maybe just most games,seem to have a bad combination of the game designers thinking "we don't need to nitpick, they will get it" and players going "haha! I can interpret the rules to make this work to my advantage **** the intent" FF seems to not really be on to how card games work in an official format and seem to come from a board game "let the players sort it out" stand point. Now maybe I have high standards being a long time CCG player and playing mainly the only game that could keep a set of cards balanced and almost errata free for 14 years (The only banned cards were for how annoying/ time consuming they were for tourny play) and not all card games can be made by the master after he learned from his mistakes (that mistake was M:TG). Can't we as players move beyond that. Do we need tiny text on every card or a massive rule book to stop obvious abuse? Can't we untie the hands of the developers to let them make a cool card without having to dig into every interaction to see if they need to rephrase something or add an addenda to the rules? I've played every type of game-from the play it like a tourny-strict V:tES that does have every interaction mapped out to the most free form rules ever made-Amber. The game that got me started with FFG was the aGoT CCG; I remember playing a B-rath rush deck from the base set. Then I took a break and my deck was obsolete there were rules I never heard of card types that were foreign. That game had bad power creep. After that FFG was off my radar for a while Then I found the best board game ever made-Arkham Horror-every time I played that game I was sure we were going to lose and scrambled around making sacrifices and barely pulling through, every time. Every game was nail biting intense almost lose but out of 50 games I think the total losses were about 4, Then I found the LotR board game- you think anything in this is hard or has a steep learning curve-play that. That wasn't "going to lose we are going to lose, we won!" like Arkham it was just "we are going to lose, we lost".  The ideas behind a co-op game board and card are new and don't fit into the heroic ideal we expect. FFG picked 2 great places to use this (Lovecraft and Tolkein). Both worlds depict comparatively helpless people fighting against overwhelming odds. It's safe to assume that if there are 2 ways to look at how a card works the one you don't like is the right one.  The Lord of the Rings book is a Eucatastrophe. The idea of the card game is that you fulfill the role of Frodo, the game makes the rules, the encounter deck is there to hurt you, the game is designed to make you lose. Do you have what it takes to win? Everything is stacked against you, accept that your fate is a cruel one and overcome.

Now maybe I have high standards being a long time CCG player and playing mainly the only game that could keep a set of cards balanced and almost errata free for 14 years (The only banned cards were for how annoying/ time consuming they were for tourny play) and not all card games can be made by the master after he learned from his mistakes (that mistake was M:TG). Can't we as players move beyond that. Do we need tiny text on every card or a massive rule book to stop obvious abuse? Can't we untie the hands of the developers to let them make a cool card without having to dig into every interaction to see if they need to rephrase something or add an addenda to the rules?



The Magic: the Gathering rules are 195 pages long.  Every bit of card text is subject to change in the Oracle database, and many, many cards' "official text" varies from the printed text.

Or are you referring to Netrunner? A game which hasn't seen official support since 1999?

I really don't understand what point you're trying to make.

I think most high-level players would actually quite like to see a ruleset for this game that is as well-templated and specific as Magic's.

It makes no sense in terms of game rules.

Attachment card types are attached during the planning phase by the player.

Player cards from player deck are attached to Elder Things when they engage, and by sharing the same word "attach" - it's a completely diffrent mechanic, attaching all - events, attachments, allies. And in this mechanic card text doesn't matters, the only thing that matters is cost.  



I love that Caleb officially ruled that the Forest Snare works!
