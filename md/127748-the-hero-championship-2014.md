Introducing the Hero Championship 2014 edition!

 

I had a ton of fun last year during Samwise Gamgee's Hero Championship
http://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/89803-the-hero-championship/?hl=bracket#entry857850 [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/89803-the-hero-championship/?hl=bracket#entry857850]

Samwise indicated that he is a little busy right now to host this tournament again, so I'm opting to host it myself... with a little guidance from him :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

This year's tournament includes heroes added from The Road Darkens, Voice of Isengard, and the first 5 heroes of the Ring Maker cycle. I really wanted to wait for the last hero to be revealed, but it looks like they showed up late to the party.

 

Seeding is based on last year's results with the new heroes being semi-arbitrarily added throughout the list. 

 

Vote for your favorite hero as they enter their match-ups in the responses below. Vote on whatever criteria you desire. Feel free to campaign for you hero, criticize the seeding and give your vote rationale. I like the option of voting on the forums to encourage friendly banter and conversation.

 

Voting closes on Friday at noon CST for the next four weeks.

Yes!  Thanks for getting this going again!

 

A: Theoden - Nori is probably better, but Theoden is king

B: Bard - A fitting matchup.  I never play either but Bard wins on art alone

C: Eowyn - Easy pick

D: Elrohir - The twins with Legolas is one of my favorite decks

E: Frodo - Key to many of my secrecy decks

F: Thalin - Like Nori, Ori can be really strong but I have a soft spot for Thalin and direct damage

G: Caldara - I've never played her or Boromir, but I like the potential of her deck

H: Eleanor - What a babe

I: Imrahil - Fun to pair with Eomer.  Glorfindel (L) hasn't aged well.

J: Denethor - I actually got some good use out of Fatty playing Black Riders, but he's pretty bad

K: Bifur - Good for secrecy

L: Pippin - One of my most used heroes.  Clutch for anything secrecy or Hobbit.

M: Merry - tough pick, but Dunhere is a one trick pony

N: Bombur - I don't like the Gandalf hero.  Too strong.

O: Haldir - So good.  Sorry Beravor.

P: Galadriel - As much as I love [Leadership Hero], something about him just rubs me the wrong way

Q: Elladan - tough to pick against Beorn, but I love the twins

R: Mablung - I like Theodred, but I can't wait to pair Mablung with the new Aragorn.

S: Celeborn - Critical for Silvan decks

T: Gimli - Never used the Bilbo hero, but I love the Bilbo ally.

U: Hama - I need to use him more.  I think he'll be the third hero to pair with Aragorn and Mablung.

V: Pippin(S) - That's right.  I know he sucks, but I like Hobbits and Dain is OP.

W: Mirlonde - Very tough call.  I love Eomer, but I use Mirlonde a lot.  Good for secrecy and Silvan.

Tough choices were:

Boromir vs. Caladra. Ive played with both a lot and li,e the, both. I went with Caldara though because she brought a whole new way to play the game that actually works and is pretty strong. Boromir is great, but every deck i play him in relies on Aragorn lore to save his a@@, so she get's my vote.

Idreaan vs pippin Lo. I like both these heroes, i went with Idrean because i built my firs ally free deck with her and had a blast. She brings something to spirit sphere that was lacking. Pippin is probably the more versatile hero, but I really only play him in hobbit deck. His 6 threat is great, but the 2 hp always make me nervous.

Dunehere vs. merry. Same story as above. I only really use merry in hobbit deck. Dunhere on the other hand is always fun to play in the right deck. Funny enough he is often paired with merry for merry's low threat and ability to play the spears, but dunhere is the star of those types of decks, merry is there for utilitarian purposes. Although merry is a beast in hobbit deck and loved playing him during Black Riders.

Some tough choices. Looking forward to seeing how this goes.

Thanks for putting it together agian.

Yeah, this was a lot of fun last time around. Thanks for bringing it back!

 

A: Nori - I want to pick Theoden for theme reasons, but Nori is so good in a Dwarf deck. Potentially one of the best threat reducers around.

B: Brand - Bard has epic art and is useful. Brand can be stupidly powerful with the right combinations.

C: Eowyn - No contest here.

D: Elrohir - This is a really tough one. Thorin is great and very powerful for Dwarves. Elrohir can be game changing though.

E: Frodo - Hirluin and Outlands is obviously very powerful, but Frodo is an amazing defensive solution for all kinds of scenarios.

F: Ori - Thalin was key for me back in the day, but that Dwarven card draw is strong.

G: Tactics Boromir - Caldara is good but Boromir is great.

H: Balin - Eleanor can definitely come in handy, but I find Balin to be an overall better package.

I: Imrahil - I'm not as down on Lore Glorfindel as many are, but Imrahil is better all around due to the readying.

J: Denethor - Big D is simply more useful more of the time.

K: Bifur - Low threat and key resource smoothing wins the day. Gloin is really fun though.

L - Lore Pippin - Idraen is a really good hero, but I've used Pippin a lot more and he can fit into a bunch of decks.

M - Merry - Again, Dunhere is good, but I'm partial to the Hobbits.

N - Gandalf - Sorry, Bombur, but Gandalf wins the day.

O - Beravor - I probably would've picked Haldir until recently, when I've rediscovered the utility of Beravor.

P - Galadriel - That [Leadership hero] is good for nothing and still owes me 20 bucks!

Q - Beorn - Elladan is definitely solid, and I love a twins deck, but Beorn is a force when used correctly.

R - Mablung - More useful as an actual participant in questing or combat.

S - Celeborn - Great hero that really put Silvan on a solid footing from the beginning of the cycle.

T - Gimli - I like Bilbo, but the whole idea of becoming stronger with damage still intrigues me.

U - Grima - Grima's so different than the other heroes in terms of theme and ability.

V - Dain - Spirit Pippin is crushed under the (iron)foot of the mighty Dain.

W - Eomer - Although I do use Mirlonde quite a bit, Eomer is just a killing machine and fun to use.

## 11 [gandalfDK on November 24, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/127748-the-hero-championship-2014/?do=findComment&comment=1345416)

A - Nori. I'm one of those guys who wants another version of him, a better one!

B - Brand son of Bain. His ability I find far more usefull!

C - Eowyn. Of course she's better, but I do like Dwalin. But forced to choose, no doubt.

D - Elrohir. Elrohir can fit in more kinds of decks, Thorin is only Dwarfdeck playable. And Elrohirs ability is great!

E - Frodo. Come on, everybody hates Outlands.  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

F - Thalin. His ability is still quite good. In the newer cycle his power fades a bit, but Ori is as with Thorin, only Dwarfdeck.

G - Tactics Boromir. Caldara needs a special deck. Boromir just some threatred, money and go for it.

H - Balin. Shadow effects keep getting nastier and nastier.

I - Imrahil. Overall better playable. Really though choice. He just to be my favorite hero back in the day!

J - Denethor. Not a real choice. Fatty's just Fatty and Denethor can do something more and his ability is more usefull.

K - Bifur. Like his ability just a little bit more, but I use them together most of the time. Too bad they are pitched together. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

L - Lore Pippin. Idraen is great, but really specific for locationcontrol decks. Pippin is a splasher more and like his low threat!

M - Merry. More versatile then Dunhere. Dunhere needs a special designed deck and Merry is secrecy and splashtactics.

N - Gandalf. Fat Dwarves are not really usefull... Not a real choice/contest here.

O - Haldir. Great ability! Wingfoot works great with Beravor, but still find Haldir more powerfull overall and less work to work.

P - Galadriel. Easy win!  :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Q - Beorn. Elladan is the lesser of the twins IMO. Beorn is a powerfull creature (!) on his own.

R - Mablung. He makes resource collection a lot more fun and has better stats, Theodred is only there for the money.

S - Celeborn. "Or rather Dain as he should be." Oin has a cool ability but Celeborn put Silvan in the picture.

T - Gimli. Gimli has been one of our great saviors since the Core Set and Bilbo has a too high threshold.

U - Grima. Like the idea of alternate history. His ability is not really my cup of tea but he's just cool!

V - Dain. Dain, the might lord of the Dwarves. Man, he's strong! Like him a lot, although he maybe should be nerfed.

W - Eomer. Mirlonde is great for mono Lore, but apart from that Eomer is just great all times! Rohan Warlord!

 

Some choices were hard and others were really easy. Cool idea and it's fun!

A - Theoden - I really think Nori is better, but I like Theoden's overall appearance and ability more, because he is awesome.

B - Bard - Sorry Brand. Maybe someday you'll get the pity vote.

C - Dwalin - Killing orcs + reducing threat for the win!

D - Elrohir - The twins are amazing. Thorin has threat that I'm not willing to go for very often.

E - Hirluin the Fair - Frodo is already a main character. Let Hirluin get some attention.

F - Ori - Two cards is too good to pass up. Thalin's ability is a little situational.

G - Boromir - Generally, I like to keep my heroes alive instead of sacrificing them for worse allies. 

H - Eleanor - Cancellation is much more appreciated and rare than resource generation. 

I - Imrahil - This is my pick for the overall champion! Imrahil is one of my absolute favorites. Lorfindel doesn't stand a chance.

J - Denethor - Hobbits will not take the win again. I'm rooting for Gondor!

K - Gloin - Awesome axe art. 

L - Idraen - If Gondor doesn't make it, then it's Dunedain for me! Go scouts!

M - Dunhere - Never use him, but I really like his ability!

N - Gandalf - Duh.

O - Haldir - Technically, I would classify Beravor as more useful, but this is again a matter of coolness.

P - Galadriel - Though everybody so far has definitely voted for [Leadership Hero], I like to stand out. 

Q - Beorn - Hard choice. But I think brute force is better than an obligatory Elrohir in order to make it work.

R - Mablung - Gotta vote for those awesome Gondor rangers.

S - Oin - Again, Celeborn is better. But I have always liked Oin, from the first moment I saw the card. Don't know why.

T- Gimli - Hands down. Rooting for my favorite damage soaker.

U - Grima - Don't like either of them, but Grima's a little more interesting.

V- Dain - I don't think I've ever used Spirit Pippin... at all. Sad, but not surprising.

W - Eomer - Another hard choice. Mirlonde is amazing, but I like Eomer's fighting prowess more than threat reduction.

A - Theoden - one of my fav heroes

B - Brand - crap vs crapper, I went for crap (I'm a solo player)

C - Eowyn - ...duh!

D - Thorin - no doubt about this one

E - Frodo - not a friend of Outlands

F - Thalin - htough cjoice, but he's so good against Goblins, and he's tactics

G - Boromir - his way of dying is way cooler

H - Eleanor - she's getting better and better with all these Gondor synergies

I - Imrahil - tough choice, I don#t play both of them often; the Gondor trait makes the difference here

J - Denethor - no question here

K - Bifur - love his low threat and he offers you flexibility for your deck building

L - Idraen - one of my fav new heroes!

M - Merry - low threat and 6 WP make him a welcome guest in every tactics deck

N - Bombur - I'm not a friend of Gandalf as a hero

O - Haldir - never had much love for Beravor, and Haldirs 3 ATT make him somewhat special

P - Galadriel - great hero!

Q - Beorn - he's fun to play!

R - Theodred - still one of the most powerful heroes

S - Celeborn - I'm a big fan of Silvan decks

T - Bilbo Baggins - very powerful ability and with some attachments he turns into a defending machine

U - Grima - don't love the character, but Grima's ability is interesting and soemthing special

V - Dain - easy choice, right?

W - Mirlonde - these are two of my fav heroes; Mirlonde gets my vote because her ability is simple, but extremely helpful

The first day's voting totals have been added to the bracket.

 

There are a lot of runaways, but don't fear! If your favorite hero is falling desperately behind, there are still three days left to vote.

 

Thank you everyone for your commentary, they are a blast to read.

I loved Leptokurt's response to the Boromir vs. Caldara match "Boromir - his way of dying is way cooler"

 

 

There is one match that is shaping up to be quite a fight:

 

HAMA (10) vs GRIMA (12)

When asked about the match-up, Hama only had pleasant things to say about his opponent. "Grima? Oh yeah, a really nice guy. Theoden just appointed him as an adviser and he seems to be working out really well."

 

Meanwhile in the Shire, Pippin and Fatty Bolger are celebrating each having one vote.

A - Nori    I don't use either much, but Nori has some fun possible schennanigans.

B - Brand     Brand is quite versatile, and that single threat lower tends to help a surprising amount.

C - Eowyn    I'm not a fan of building a unique deck for each scenario, so Balin has almost never been used.

D - Elrohir     Never been much fan of the dwarven cards, and Elrohir/Elladan have tons of gameplay decisions to make.

E - Frodo      Frodo is just an awesome hero.

F - Thalin      I've never quite gotten a Thalin deck that I am fully satisfied with... but I still love trying.

G - Boromir (T)     Lots of meaningful gameplay decisions.

H - Eleanor    I have always loved Elearnor - low threat, occasionally life-saving ability, good defender with the shield

I - Imrahil       Now even better with his good buddy Eomer.

J - Denethor  Consistent use since the core set

K - Gloin        I love trying to set up the gloin resource engine

L - Idraen       I like both of these heroes, but Idraen opens up a somewhat new deck type

M - Dunhere   Merry does open up a lot of decks, being a tactics hero with low threat... but Dunhere is just so fun!

N - Bombur     I don't have the road darkens, but I feel there shouldn't be a Gandalf hero.

O - Beravor     Difficult choice, but I went for versatility. Both are excellent heroes.

P - Galadriel    Not only is she awesome, but why would anyone vote for an unknown hero? I'm hoping its Thranduil or Cirdan.

Q - Elladan      Beorn is cool, but Elladan opens up tons of in-game choices.

R - Mablung     Versatile + resource generation in tactics? Awesome.

S - Celeborn    Celeborn is just cool! Plus he has a unique distribution of stats, and 3 will in leadership is quite welcome.

T - Gimli           Gimli is always fun, and Bilbo simply has too high of threat for what he offers

U - Hama         Doomed cards are much more difficult to play in multiplayer

V - Dain            I have actually never used spirit pippin. And Dain is, well, Dain.

W - Mirlonde    Another very difficult choice. Mirlonde simply makes so many decks work. Eomer is tons of fun though.

 

Most choices were fairly easy, with a couple of exceptions - notably Idraen/Pippin, Dunhere/Merry, and Mirlonde/Eomer.

I suppose that I had better vote:

A - Theoden:

B - Brand: He was so bad for so long, then we realized how good he can be. But, he still suffers from his old reputation

C - Eowyn: Shield maiden all the way!

D - Elrohir: love the twins

E - Frodo: Better art and more often used

F - Thalin:
G - Boromir: So, maybe it's not a Magali piece like Caldara, but wow does he carry a lot of decks
H - Eleanor: I just can't get on board with Balin. What is he doing behind that rock anyway?
I - Imrahil:
J - Fatty: I used him and I like him *ducks for cover*
K - Bifur: 
L - Idraen: made location control exciting 
M - Merry: 
N - Gandalf:

O - Haldir: so much fun!

P - Galadriel: I'm assuming that no matter who the new her is, Galadriel will be better :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Q - Elladan: love the twins

R - Mablung: 

S - Celeborn:

T - Bilbo Baggins: He's such a charming way to spread card draw around the table

U - Hama - much better hair than Grima
V - Dain - sorry pippin

W - Eomer: so much fun!

It's funny. I was wondering why faramir wasn't in the list, then saw he's seeded! Haldir coming along has just made me forget Faramir these days - he was quite popular last time, but can't see it holding this time. Which is sad, but it'll be no surprise if Haldir is seeded in future. Fan favorite!

A: Nori--Despite Theoden probably having my favorite art in the game, the beer loving dwarf gets my vote for his utility 

 

B: Bard--I've never gotten in the habit of using either (legolas is the my prefered tactics ranged character of choice) but Bard's art is a million times better so theres the vote

 

C: Eowyn--The quintessential quester vs. limited and outdated dwarf. wasnt tough matchup

D: Elrohir-- I really like Thorin but the elf twins are where its at

E: Frodo-- Frodo still remains a spectacular champ after all this time.  Hirluin himself is kind of boring like the archetype he represents

 

F: Ori--The card draw prevails against Thalin the crow killer

G: Boromir--tactics boromir is as good as ever with the emphasis on the "aggro" archetype the ringmaker cycle has made necessary.  He gets the nod

 

H: Balin-- Both are good utility heroes in their own right but Balin gets my vote here since i think he's more unique for the sphere he represents

 

I: Prince Imrahil--Always been a fan of the prince and against lore glorfindel, obviously not a contest

 

J: Denethor--Havent used him in a good bit but was always a fan of his low threat, good defense, and an incredibly useful scrying effect.  Not a fatty fan

 

K: Bifur-- Just too much to like about Bifur, some very underrated art, good effect, low threat. just great

 

L: Idraen-- Going with the underdog in this fight.  I dig her

M: Merry-- Never been a huge fan of Dunhere, i feel like he exists mostly for Morgal Vale anymore

 

N:Gandalf--I mean come on. The grey wizard is going to win this thing isnt he? Popular, powerful, not broken like spirfindel...got everything going for it

 

O: Haldir--Couldnt have been happier with the hero version of one of my favorite characters. stats, threat, traits, and ability all just make for a fantastic card

 

P: Galadriel

Q: Elladan--I already picked Elrohir above so that means i need to pick Elladan. Its all or nothing

 

R: Theodred-- I like that these two were matched together as they both provide some unconventional means of resource production.  Maybe its just cause i havent put the time in with Mablung yet but Theodred gets my vote for his years of usefulness

 

S: Celeborn-- Celeborn could win this contest on art alone but the fact he's the cornerstone of the funnest new archetype makes him an easy pick for the obscure dwarf

 

T: Gimli-- Two champs I dont really play much anymore but Gimli gets my vote since i've always been bitter about Bilbo's insane threat penalty

 

U: Grima--He's interesting I guess.

V: Dain--I dont think the king of dwarves is going to have a tough matchup against the worst hero in the game

 

W: Eomer--A one man wrecking crew that feels unique among a crowded field of attacking oriented tactics characters.  Tough choice because i do dig Mirlonde a lot, sorry gurl.

Most people are picking Gandalf....I hate him as a hero. Not his stats, I just hate that he is a now a permenent character in the company when playing. Its just wrong. I just like when Gandalf pops in for some help and then goes off to attend the other important business he has going on in Middle Earth.

He is up against Bombur, though.  He is one of those heroes that many people just do not like.  I for one love the fat dwarf and have used him quite a bit, but... Bombur vs. Gandalf.  It is a foregone conclusion.  It'll be more interesting to see how Gandalf fares against more popular characters.

I'm going to put a list mostly according to quality (in my opinion, of course)

 

A. Theoden. I like balanced heroes who can serve several purposes, and the defunct king of Rohan is a good quester, and even if not amazingly, he can combat decently too. Nori is a good hero too, but not so versatile and depends too much on dwarf synergy to be awesome. And Théoden gets the Villeneuve point ^^.

 

B. Brand. Apparently I am one of the very few who likes these two heroes since I don't like playing solo (it's not Brand's fault to have that face). It was a tough call, even more against Villeneuve point but once again, with his special ability Brand proves to be more versatile (even with that huh? face of his). Not like it matters since Éowyn will obliterate him in the next round but, GO BRAND! 

 

C. Éowyn. Dwalin, you never were a particularly good hero (even if yours is one of the dwarf designs I like better), and your ally version is much more useful... you never stood a chance.

 

D. Thorin. I like the twins, but the fact that you need both for them to be good still hurts. Thorin is a nice quester, and has decent attack power and he is a dwarf (even if I don't like dwarves I have to acknowledge their power). Once again, sorry, Villeneuve point (even more against the holy bearded mother)

 

E. Frodo. I actually like Hirluin, since he's one of the very few ranged heroes out of tactics and I love his name in Spanish - Hirluin el Hermoso, but Frodo's ability to sponge damage has saved me lots of times.

 

F. Thalin. Ori needs more preparation to be really good and with the increase of damage to staging area cards I think Thalin became a more solid choice (particularly combined with Haldir and the ranger bows) and in combat is more or less okay.

 

G. Boromir (T). I like Caldara, a lot. But the problem is that even if she has an interesting ability and the Villeneuve point... she is pretty weak as a hero per se. Not a great quester and a pitiful fighter. And I like the alternative art of Boromir.

 

H. Eleanor. I think both are amazingly good, providing permanent cancel ability but, truth to be told, end-breaking cards are usually treachery cards. I can't recall how many times has she already saved my group's ass. Maybe with peril rules and the late development of cannot be cancelled cards she might be becoming weaker but still pretty solid. And last nail to Balin's coffin, Villeneuve point.

 

I. Glorfindel. Yes, I know, I deserve dead for not choosing Imrahil but I think lore Glorfindel is actually a pretty underrated hero (he's only real downside is the existence of spirit Godfidel). He is a good quester, good attacker and, paired with Elrond, healing when you really need it, from the very beginning. Pity the art is kind of meh. It was a hard choice, though.

 

J. Fatty. I don't think in multiplayer Denethor is such a good hero even if he can be a decent defender. I like the hobbit since it's a good way to make use of a really low threat (it's not really that useful to 20 less than the rest of the party) and sometimes can be really helpful. Not great but not bad.

 

K. Bifur. Low threat, and good ability; very good to stabilize multisphere decks.

 

L. Idraen. The macho-girl versatility is what makes her so good. With well-rounded attributes and auto-ready ability I think she is pretty good. I think Peregrin is a good hero but that fragility of his makes me a little bit nervous in certain scenarios.

 

M. Merry. Dunhere is good hero but when it comes to versatility, Merry is better, as a quester and even as a fighter (particularly for his readying ability). Low threat is also a good think. The only thing that almost made me choose Dunhere is the same reason why I discarded Pippin, those 2 hp...

 

N. Gandalf. Hands down, a beast of a hero. Both amazing and well-rounded attributes and a great ability (also comes with a lot of accessories, like a Barbie). I don't like him that much because I think the ally is very helpful and versatile but the fact that he is a beast cannot be denied. Poor Bombur, bat match-up.

 

O. Beravor. Only because of her (his?) versatility. Not amazing at anything but can quest, fight or provide cards. Tough call, though, since I think Haldir is a powerhouse but I always prefer versatility if I can choose. And I don't like heroes with an ally version.

 

P. Galadriel. I think she will be a dark horse of this tournament. The more I use her the more I think she is awesome. With easy-to-flee allies such as Gandalf, Elrond, Refugees, Saruman, she multiplies their usefulness allowing them to use their awesome questing power and then fight or chumpblock. Also free threat lowering and drawing effect? Yes, please.

 

Q. Beorn. I like bears and in this case, Beorn is a "beast" fighting with base 5 atk power and non-exhausting defense. Once again, I like the twins but their mutual dependence makes them a harder pick.

 

R. Mablung. Probably one of the tightest fights. Resource acceleration is always a good thing. However, tactics really needed resource acceleration while in leadership are several other options. And Mablung is a more well-rounded character. 

 

S. Celeborn. Stronger hero, stronger ability, Magali Villeneuve. 

 

T. Gimli. Awesome versatility and the dwarf trait. It could have been a harder fight if Bilbo had a realistic initial threat like 6 or 7 (I don't think his ability deserves making his threat so high with such crappy attributes).

 

U. Háma. I like them both but the recycling ability of Háma can be really good and Wormtongue is not really that popular in multiplayer since he can crash your party strategy.

 

V. Dain. I think Spirit Pippin is not that bad, but Lore one is much better and Dain is the cornerstone of the over 9000 dwarves.

 

W. Mirlonde. Once again a tough call. Even if both of them are pretty specific at what they do (Éomer is there to kill and Mirlonde to quest) the fact that Mirlonde is one of the very few choices besides Godfindel to try secrecy makes her a little bit better and being a Silvan can sponge a little bit of damage.

Guys, if Bilbo's properly used he is one of the best heroes. All you need is Protector of Lorien and fast Hitch.

To summarize:

 

Best quester.

A – Theoden : Doesn't matter if the hero card isn't perfect... it's Theoden!

B – Bard the Bowman : Benefits from a weak first round opponent (Brand)who has such ugly artwork.

C – Eowyn : She finds her way into so many decks... and he card boosting willpower ability is great.

D – Elrohir: Elrohir works so well with Elladan, and the Dwarf heroes just aren’t very interesting right now.

E – Frodo Baggins: Frodo is a very useful hero… and I am not voting for Outlands anything.

F – Thalin: While Ori is basically going to be in dwarf only decks, Thalin is versatile and can be used in many decks.

G – Boromir (T): Bad ass.  And Caldara is just weird.

H – Eleanor: Gorgeous artwork, handles the Palantir nicely, what’s not to like?

I – Prince Imrahil: Very versatile.

J – Denethor: Under-rated in the game.  Are you really going to pick Fatty over Denethor?

K – Bifur: Another dwarf, like Thalin, that is very useful in a variety of combinations and not just dwarf decks.

L – Pippin (Lo): This one is close, but I just really like Pippin.  And this one is so much better than the other Pippin.

M – Dunhere:  Dunhere has gotten really fun to play as the card pool has grown.

N – Gandalf:  Gandalf or a fat dwarf???  Gandalf, enough said. 

O – Haldir of Lorien: This one is close, but I love Haldir’s ability.

P – Galadriel: I heart Galadriel.

Q – Beorn: I like Elladan, but Beorn is just so different, and so useful .

R – Theodred: Theodred is under rated and still useful in a variety of decks and particularly in 2,3 or 4 player games.

S – Celeborn: Great card, great hero… pulls the whole Silvan thing together.

T – Gimli: Gimli is here just because he helped me finally beat Heirs of Numenor back in the day.

U – Grima: Totally cool thematically.  Love the artwork and his ability.

V – Dain Ironfoot:  Dain only gets my vote because Pippin (S) is crap.

W – Mirlonde: While I really like Eomer.  I just love Mirlonde in my Lore decks.

I'm sorry, but trashing your entire hand every round to keep from losing a hero that shouldn't be defending without more help doesn't sound like a great game plan. Granted, he provides the extra cards you need for trashing, but I prefer to USE my cards, not discard them. He would need 1 more "permanent" defense and at least one more hit point for me to trust him.

A: Théoden- I am on fan of Theoden, but he is better than Nori. And I believe that Theodens day will once come and he will become stronger.

B: Bard- He is less bad
C: Eowyn- Eowyn is here since the core set, and she has always been one of the most used heroes. It is just a useful quester.
D: Elrohir- As I said I am not fan of dwarves. And twins decks are very interesting.
E: Frodo- Easy decision.
F: Ori- The few games I played Ori, he was fun to play. Shame he is dependent on dwarves so much.
G: Boromir (T)- Caldara just does not work for me. 
H: Balin- His ability is getting more and more useful with each expansion. His biggest advantage is, that he is the only hero that can skip shadow effects.
I: Prince Imrahil- Always useful readying ability.
J: Denethor- I used him a lot in core set. Very good for solo games.
K: Bifur- good ability, low threat. It is like he gives lore resource icon to one another hero, but better. :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

L: Pippin (L)- this guy is amazing. Not only in hobbit decks, but also outside of it for his low threat and ability.
M: Dunhere- Hard decision, but I just love direct damaging and staging area attacks.
N: Gandalf- Bombur has useless ability, for my playstyle.
O: Haldir of Lorien- of course Haldir! One of my absolutely favourite heroes. He is amazing, well balanced stats and ability.
P: [Leadership hero]-amazing ability
Q: Beorn- very unique hero. Sometimes you dont care about combos and tactics and you just run Beorn and kill everything.
R: Mablung- I dont like Theodred
S: Celeborn- I love Silvan decks
T: Gimli- the whole idea of his ability is amazing. And it is also useful.
U: Hama- You can make amazing interesting decks with Hama. Not that Grimas ability is not unique, but Hama is better.
V: Dain Ironfoot- I know that everyone will vote for Pippin, cos noone uses Dain, but for me Dain is quite OK hero, he is not that bad.
W: Eomer- Amazing hero

Second day totals have been updated.

 

While there is still a lot of opportunity for every match-up, four in particular have become quite exciting.

 

Thorin (20) vs. Elrohir (22)

Balin (19) vs Eleanor (23)

Pippin (22) vs. Idraen (20)

Hama (24) vs. Grima (18)

 

I'm loving everyone's commentary and really looking forward to the next round. Our top 10 from last year each had a bye and things are sure to get heated.

Uhm, I played with him and it worked out brilliantly. Arwen gives him that point, or you play the Boots of Erebor on him.

 

And regardng the waste management part, IMO it's better to use all your cards instead of having some of them left in your hand. Bilbo's like the Darwin of this game - he let's the fittest cards survive and cares for those who are not so fit.

You said all you need is Protector of Lorien and Fast Hitch. I assumed that you actually meant that that was all you needed. In many cases, that will be true, but if you use PoL too much, you'll run out of cards so you'll want some more permanent boosts. If you can get Arwen and the Boots out, then I would consider him much more usable. I still prefer a defender that can do a decent job right out of the gate (3+ defense and hit points base), but if you were able to set up quickly enough, then I wouldn't mind using him. The issue is that Denethor has a lower starting threat and starts off with these base stats so is much more useful. Not to mention he can get a permanent +2 defense with Shield of Gondor. Bilbo has the advantage that a lot of the cards that he can use to become a decent defender reside in his own sphere or are neutral (aside from Arwen), but even Denethor could use Protector of Lorien.

I just don't see the point of gimping yourself with a weak defender to start if you can get a notably stronger one with less threat. The card draw is a strong consideration, but it's not too hard to get the card draw you need from Lore without him. His Hobbit trait is useful in certain decks, but under usual circumstances I'd take someone else instead.

 

I don't want to be stomping all over your opinion or anything, but your argument is that Bilbo is a great defender. With your logic, almost any hero can be a good defender if you devote enough deck space to making them so, which is actually true. So really, Bilbo's only real strength is the one everyone already knows about: card draw.

Bilbo is a great defender mainly because of his ability to attach Fast Hitch which enables him to defend multiple times. And hey, of course you should have A Burning Brand, too. Bilbo's sphere also gives him access to instant healing power. With these attachments and his lore sphere only Beregond is comparable to him when it's about defending.

 

Alas, it would be a real shame if Bilbo wouldn't even make it to round 2. He truly deserves it!

I have used Bilbo as defender like this, but it was ages ago when attacks used to be 2 or 3. In the more recent scenarios 3 -5 attack strength is becoming the norm, so I'm not sure how he would hold up nowadays, since he could get hit hard early on and he need s a bit of set up with the cards you mentioned.

Look at Three trials for instance. Bilbo would not stand a chance, where there a re a number of other defenders that can hold there own. I'd say second best defender is pushing it. He's decent, but i think the best defenders now are from gondor and have easy access to Gondorian shield. If not from Gondor then they get SoG to provide the trait.

Elrohir is a far far better defender than Bilbo.... But then again in my opinion so are Beregond and Denethor as well!

Yeah totally agree. Three base defense, 4 hitpoints, the right sphere to receive burning brand and the right trait to receive Cloak of Lorien. And yeah like you said he can boost healing on himself OH and can also receive Elven Mail as well. 

But yeah Bilbo is definitely not the second best defensive hero, potentially not even top five either as Beorn, . 

Also as good as Fast hitch is on Bilbo, Elrohir's response ability is far better as you can block as many attacks as you have resources on him. Hmmmmm actually I guess that because Fast Hitch isn't restricted or even limit one per character you could put 2 or 3 on Bilbo which would be pretty decent allowing him to defend up to four times, his low defense and health still poses a problem however and I would not trust him in Nightmare quests or pretty much any quest where there are enemies with 5 or more attack (most quests lol) as he will almost definitely require constant healing or constant discarding of your hand (to protector of lorien) to boost his defense.

Yeah burning brand on Elrond with a healer handy is often enough (till boss types show up). Just Lembas early on can be enough - defend, heal, ready defend again - so long as you kill the enemies or have drawn multiple copies :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

I like the idea of elven mail (haven't used yet), on Elrond... creating a wound taking sponge but highly heal-able unlike a certain awesome bear.

I dont think that Dain should have been like Celeborn. Celeborn is more balanced but his ability also fits well with the faction's theme. I just think that Dain should have had something to make it harder for him to keep the boost or make it only increase one stat.

I did not mean for Dain to have the exact same ability as Celeborn, but meant that Celeborns ability is perfect (given his trait). Not broken and very usefull. Dain should have had, as you say, something different and more cohesion with Dwarfs, although not the five Dwarves thing, but something else. (and he should have had the noble trait...)

In the meantime:

Doom will fall upon the Hamavoters!

While you control less than 5 dwarf characters and dain is ready, each dwarf character you control gains +1 attack and +1 willpower.

I think this would balance dain a little. He would give you the start boost, and when you have 5 dwarfs, you dont need it so much anymore, as dwarfs gain those OP effects "while you control at least 5 dwarfs..."

The best suggestion I've seen for Dain is to limit his ability to allies instead of characters.

Today's update comes a little later than usual. I had this this big family thing today that got in the way,

 

In the final 12 hours of voting, 2 exciting matches have risen to the top:

 

Th%C3%A9oden.jpg [https://s3.amazonaws.com/hallofbeorn-resources/Images/Cards/The-Morgul-Vale/Th%C3%A9oden.jpg]     vs     Nori.png [https://s3.amazonaws.com/hallofbeorn-resources/Images/Cards/The-Hobbit-Over-Hill-and-Under-Hill/Nori.png]

It appears that Theoden has rallied his steed and road Snowmane to within five votes of his beer guzzling dwarven opponent.

 

 

Also, Pippn (Lo) and Idraen are within one vote!!!

I know Hama can be boring if you abuse it's ability, specially with feint. But if you avoid that kind of "cheating", it's a great hero which gives you a lot of versatility. I really like using it to recycle foe-hammer.

A-Nori (Easy choice because Theoden's ability is just ****)

B-Bard the Bowman (Hard choice because I like both, Bard gets the edge because of his heroic role in the Hobbit)

C-Eowyn (Like the hero card and also prefer ladies over dwarfs :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] )

D-Thorin (Wonder why Elrohir has not beeing seeded against his brother but in this matchup he has no chance)

E-Frodo (Tired of Outlands...)

F-Thalin (Direct damage all the way! Screw you 1 hitpoint enemies!)

G-Boromir (Who dares to pick Caldara?!)

H-Eleanor (This lady still has some charm and a beautiful name too. See, I'm not biased in this voting process :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] )

I-Imrahil (Clear choice, ability is so much better and Lore-Glorfi is covered under some dust in my cardbox)

J-Denethor (Don't like either of these characters so it's all about the ability and there Denethor has the edge)

K-Bifur (Hard choice, gut says Bifur but if you ask me tomorrow it could have been Gloin)

L-Pippin (Let's stay with true LOTR characters please)

M-Dunhere (Charge of the Rohirrim brought new life to this hero at least for me)

N-Gandalf (I'm scared to pick Bombur here ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] )

O-Haldir (Tough choice again but I would give a slight edge to Haldir maybe because he's newer and I play him more)

P-Galadriel (Who is this guy that wants to compete with the lady of the forest?! No match for her!)

Q-Beorn (Put theses two guys in a ring 1 on 1 and you will see who is the better hero ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] )

R-Mablung (I like this hero sooooo much because he is a bomb in my eagle deck!)

S-Celeborn (Thats how Dain and Theoden should have been designed)

T-Gimli (Easy choice, still so much fun to play this hero)

U-Grima (Neither?! But I want to keep my head so I have to choice Grima, right gandalfDK? :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] )

Eacht time someone votes Hama, his karma will come back at him. Or in game perspective: he gains doomed X+1, X is the number of votes for Hama.

The King’s Councillor


grima.png [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/ffg_content/lotr-lcg/the-voice-of-isengard/grima.png] [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/ffg_content/lotr-lcg/the-voice-of-isengard/grima.png]I know some fans will question the decision to make Gríma a hero, but I hope that after reading this preview they will appreciate the thought that went into it and the exciting gameplay options that come as a result. As with all of our card designs for The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game, we try to combine the spirit of the source material with a fitting game mechanic. Accordingly, the first part of our rational for making Gríma a hero is thematic.


Gríma was chief advisor to the King of Rohan, which made him a very influential person in Middle-earth. It’s safe to assume he did not attain that position by giving bad advice. Gríma’s wisdom and cunning must have benefitted Rohan initially in order for Théoden to promote him to his lofty position, and in the timeline of the card game Gríma’s treachery, like Saruman’s, was not yet fully developed. It is possible that Gríma could have chosen the hero path at this time.


Mechanically, Gríma has a unique place in The Voice of Isengard that only he can fill. As the only character in the game with both the Rohan andIsengard traits, Grima bridges the two factions present on the player cards in the box. Furthermore, his ability allows players to take full advantage of the Doomed mechanic: “Action: Lower the cost of the next card you play from your hand this round by 1. That card gains Doomed 1. (Limit once per round.)” As a Lore hero, Gríma belongs to a sphere that excels at drawing cards but struggles to find the resources to pay for them, so he will be a welcome addition to many decks. Having trouble finding matching resources to pay for cards in your dual-sphere deck? Make it easier to play them by lowering their cost! Want to play a four cost ally on your first turn? Now you can! These are just a couple of the ways you can benefit from heeding Gríma’s counsel.

By the way, reading this article now it's funny how there is emphasis on Grima "bridging two factions together - Rohan and Isengard", when cycle has ZERO Isengard support at all.

> Well it does say "Grima bridges the two factions present on the player cards IN THE BOX." It doesn't even pretend Isengard will show up in the cycle.

The point is, there is no actual bridging. Yes, he has two faction traits. What good that does to him that it does not for any other rohan hero? Zero. Even IN THE BOX there is technically zero direct isengard support. What's the point in the "bridging" statement? Just to provide an example, a hero that would have both Rohan and Gondor printed traits would actually brige two factions and it would actually matter gameplay-wise.

X. Legolas No contest

Y. Eowyn No contest

Z. Elrohir Just can't get Boromir to work for me but that has more to do with gondor. Elrohir is one of the best defenders in game

Aa. Frodo Close call, but frodo's ability has alowed me to defeat smaug and other big baddies.

Ab. Elrond i like direct damage decks, but Elrond is the better hero by far.

Ac. Boromir T Eleanor has made a come back in my decks, but Boromir has been consistent all the while.

Ad. Beregond best defender hands down, although i have always liked imrahil and he saw more play with eomer around.

Ae. Bifur never really liked scrying decks although denethor is very good, bifur can be the real glue of a deck

Af. Sam both are good, but same is better

Ag. Gandalf opens up whole new way to deck build.

Ah. Haldir No contest. What faramir could have been.

Ai. Galadriel i'll use Galadriel in my decks more than beorn, she's pretty awesome.

Aj. Glorfindel S. Still a crutch at times.

Ak. Celeborn great hero, did not play him much until recently, but fits perfect into the silvan theme.

Al. Aragorn Lo No contest. His ability allows for many differnt types of deck builds.

Am. Eomer Lots of fun to play while dain is boring, but still useful for a really tough challenge.

X - Legolas for being awesome and having one of those abilities that breaks with sphere themes

Y - Bard - not for sheer power or even the amount of table time he sees, but for being one of those niche heroes that is just really fun to play in the right deck

Z - Elrohir , but kind of a tough call.  Been enjoying this Boromir a bit more recently.

AA - Frodo, although if this had been Frodo vs. Strider I would have made a different call

AB - Elrond for power.

AC - Boromir again for power, he's almost a broken card

AD - Bereond for making me feel safe and warm

AE - Denethor to the finals!!   The original wall, and a super awesome ability.

AF - Sam for that so nice 3 willpower with a low threat cost

AG - Merry.  Gandalf obviously wins for power, but Merry opens up gameplay that is more my style-- fun with Eomer, Firefoot, and Mighty Prowess!

AH - Haldir for a very cool ability

AI - Beorn because BEAR

AJ - Mablung for some long needed tactics resource love, and because we should all shelf Glorry for a year just as an exercise in deckbuilding.

AK - Gimli.  People say he is outdated but I still find him a top-notch tactics hero with well-rounded stats and very high damage potential.

> The point is, there is no actual bridging. Yes, he has two faction traits. What good that does to him that it does not for any other rohan hero? Zero. Even IN THE BOX there is technically zero direct isengard support. What's the point in the "bridging" statement? Just to provide an example, a hero that would have both Rohan and Gondor printed traits would actually brige two factions and it would actually matter gameplay-wise.

Grima's effect powers the Isengard cards and having the Rohan trait allows him to benefit from effects that power Rohan and his ability helps pay for the expensive Rohan cards (mostly the attachments and events; the allies are pretty affordable). He seems like a decent bridge to me. The only downside is the tiny amount of Isengard cards.

This way, any doomed card can be called a card that bridges Isengard and all other traits, which is would not be a valid point.

X - Legolas - No contest

Y - Eowyn - A one trick pony, but she's essential for Rohan decks and still the best at questing

Z - Elrohir - The better of the twins, and I've never been able to use Boromi's ability well.  Imrahil is always better.

AA - Frodo - Aragorn can be a beast with the Sword, but Frodo is one of my favorite heroes.  If only you could use him in the saga boxes.

AB - Elrond - I like Thalin, but he doesn't scale to the new quests well.  Elrond is a stud, although I find Vilya decks to be very boring.

AC - Eleanor - I know Boromir can be a beast, but I just don't like that kind of deck and Eleanor's art is 100x better.

AD - Beregond - Toughest pick so far.  I love Imrahil, but there is nothing quite like Beregond.

AE - Denethor - The original defender.  I like his synergy with burning brand and shield.  I also like the potential of heir of Mardil (and optional Palantir for the theme win)

AF - Pippin - I love Sam too and he can be a powerhouse, but Pippin is my go-to lore hero and in almost every secrecy deck I run.

AG - Merry - I love the Hobbits, but this is more a protest vote against Gandalf.

AH - Faramir - I have an irrational love for Faramir and I fully understand that Haldir is better in virtually every way.  I just want to make sure Faramir doesn't get shut out.

AI - Galadriel - Tough call because I like Beorn.  However, I almost never play him and Galadriel is new and shiny and opens up more secrecy options.

AJ - Mablung - Another tough call because I use Glorfindel a lot for secrecy.  I hope Galadriel can reduce my reliance on him and I am really excited about the potential of Mablung/Dunedain deck.

AK - Celeborn - Silvan decks are so much fun and he is the anchor.  I like Gimli, but rarely use him anymore.

AL - Hama - Aragorn is better, but for some reason his threat reset feels like a gimmick to me, especially when you use it on multiple people.  I love the Rohan/mount synergy that is developing. 

AM - Eomer - This is an actual vote for Eomer instead of just a protest vote against Dain.  Just needs one attachment to be attacking for 7 with splash.

X - Legolas. my favorite tactics hero along with Gimli back from the Core Set

 

Y - Eowyn. No contest here..

 

Z - Elrohir. Great defender and his ability is really nice. Gondor trait isn't just there yet IMO.

 

AA - Frodo. Just like Frodo a little better. Didn't use the Theodred-Aragorn combo that much.
 

AB - Elrond. Great healing ability, stats and ability for smoothing. Also Vilya is great! I have put him together with Gala and Gandalf and they are awesome!

 

AC - Boromir Tactics. Just for Brandon. I love how he talks about him, it's so funny.

 

AD - Prince Imrahil. He got new live in this cycle and he his cool with Rohan. (nice thematic thouch)

 

AE - Bifur. Really hard one, because I used Denethor a lot, especially defender. Scrying not so much, because only 1 UC is wasted then imo and I didn't really understand the full power of scrying back then.

 

AF - Pippin Lore. Also hard choice, but the drawing is great and the +1 saved the day often for me.

 

AG - Gandalf. Good old Gandalf! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] He is just so cool and fun to play and powerfull.

 

AH - Haldir of Lorien. Another hard one, but Haldirs ability is just really awesome and Faramir doens't really synergize with his trait.... Something that always blurred me....

 

AI - Beorn. My wrath for Grima will be great, but Dan's wrath if we don't vote Beorn... At least I'm save. But I do love Gala.. :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

AJ - Spirit Glorfindel. He is just so powerfull. Although I do like Mablung a lot and the vets will hate me for getting Splorfindel again..
 

AK - Gimli. Great attacker! Slayed the Balrog and the Watcher multiple times with him.

 

AL - Aragorn Lore. Great ability, stats and cool personage; Strider!

 

AM - Wanted to go with Dain, because he is just cool, but Eomer has the noble trait at least..

X. Legolas. He's always been pretty good but since now silvans can sponge damage to a certain degree without bothering that much and get attack over 9000, he's sooo much better. And Villeneuve point.

 

Y. Eowyn. Since both of them are one-trick ponies and designers have decided that being one of the best archers of human history is not good enough to allow you to use an elven bow (cause everybody knows only elves can shoot), Bard became one of the worst choices if you are looking for a ranged hero.

 

Z. Boromir. Mass boosting is always a good thing to have (even more in multiplayer) and Villeneuve point. Moreover, Elrohir alone... bad choice.

 

AA. Frodo. The peace of mind his damage-swallow ability brings is priceless. I think Leadagorn is good but most likely the worst out of his 3 actual versions.

 

AB. Elrond. Really good quester and defender, and being elf and lore allows more cards to boost these aspects. And multisphere smoothing plus healing boost. One of the epitomes of versatility. And Villeneuve point. Can I ask for more?

 

AC. Eleanor. Yes, Boromir is a one-man shield (because there are no real good attack boosters for Gondor characters and no way to make him an elf) but that's pretty much it. Eleanor's treachery cancel can save a game and in worst case can be

improvised as a defender with a shield.. 

 

AD. Imrahil. Imrahil is pretty versatile and has autoreading ability which is good and being a Gondor allows to boost questing and defense. Beregond is a one-trick pony.

 

AE. Bifur. I never thought Denethor deserved to pass last round so why should I vote for him in this one when Bifur is actually a really good hero.

 

AF. Sam. When it comes to attributes, Sam wins. He can be autoreadied. No **** 2 hp and free pony. Better quester. And let's be fair, usually Pippin owner end up depending on other players to save their sorry asses in order to draw more ^^.

 

AG. Gandalf. One of the best heroes there are (best attributes, awesome ability and lots of good attachments). I don't like using him that much but the fact that he is awesome is undeniable. And I think the sneak+Gandalf combo could take a rest.

 

AH. Haldir. A better ranged hero choice, even more being an elf plus the possibility of the preventive strike. And the Faramir ally is so much better.

 

AI. Galadriel. I have already said that I think she is the dark horse of the tournament so making her drop here would be contradicting myself ^^. It was a tough call, however.

 

AJ. Mablung. Leaving aside my disdain for Godfindel being in almost all decks... I think Mablung is awesome. More resources in tactics + Gondor (blood of gondor and gondorian fire) is always a good thing to have. He can also be boosted by the Visionary Leadership and Théoden as well as get a shield which gives him more versatility in my opinion. 

 

AK. Celeborn. I think as a hero per se Gimli is better than Celeborn but Celeborn has a mass boosting ability which in the end makes him the best choice. And put him together with a Galadriel...

 

AL. Loragorn. I like Háma a lot but he is less versatile than Loragorn and there are very good uses for threat resetting. If have had ranged or an easy way to get I could change my mind but since there is only one card (and it's not even his own sphere).

 

AM. Dain. Mass boost always wins. The more the players the more mass boost wins. And Éomer is a one-trick pony. I like him better but truth to be told... Dain IS better.

X- Legolas: I like Nori, but this is an easy win
Y- Eowyn: tough match-up for Bard, but Eowyn is just too good to vote out now
Z-Elrohir: he's the best defender in the game once he's all set up
AA- Aragorn: lots of fond memories from the core set days, and he's great in the saga expansions (until we can't use him)
AB- Elrond: don't really have anything to say.  He's great
AC- Boromir (Tactics): one of my favorite heroes, there's just so many epic moments you can pull off with him
AD: Imrahil: getting new life with his buddy Eomer
AE: Denethor: tough call because both are good, so I'm going with my favorite chracter
AF: Sam: hard choice because I usually use them in tandem and both are valuable even when separated, but Sam is my favorite character from the books
AG: Gandalf: he's awesome and opens up a lot of fun new decks to play.  I feel like I've barely scratched the surface of his potential, and the really high threat decks I'm making with him are a blast to play
AH: Haldir: what Faramir should have been
AI: Galadriel: do you want a hero who comes with her own attachments, or one who can't even have them?..............I thought so.
AJ: Glorfindel: haven't even tried Mablung yet and Glorfindel brought me through too many scenarios for me to turn my back on him now
AK: Gimli: I like Celeborn and the Silvan, but my Gimli-Firefoot attachment deck gave him new life for me
AL: Aragorn: still bitter that Hama beat Grima
AM: Eomer: I play Eomer because he makes the game more enjoyable.  I don't play Dain because he makes the game less enjoyable.  Easy choice.

X: Legolas - Nori is restricted to dwarf decks and doesn't offer anything that you can't elsewhere in the spirit sphere. Legolas, though is an amazing attacker and offers an amazing benefit for doing his job. He also fits into a much larger range of decks.

 

Y: Eowyn - Bard only works in multiplayer and has wasted stats. Eowyn really doesn't have any wasted stats and can excel in both solo and multiplayer.

 

Z: Elrohir - This is a tough choice, but leadership Boromir is only useful in Gondor decks, and even then he often doesn't deliver as much as you expect. Elrohir requires his brother, and some resource acceleration. A deck that has Elrohir requires a lot of specialization, but not as much as leadership Boromir. Also, I prefer readying to stat boosting.

 

AA: Frodo Baggins - Another tough choice. I tend to favor readying, so leadership Aragorn gets an edge there, but Frodo has saved so many lives it isn't even funny. Also, the ability to defend without the risk of death while you're exhausted is close enough to readying in my book. Aragorn's readying is also expensive and restricted to certain timing, so you need some sort of resource acceleration and you're not necessarily sure if you need to ready so you can ready him when you won't need him. Elrohir's readying is just enough less restrictive to make it seem way better than Aragorn's. Finally, Aragorn's starting threat can be a big negative factor.

 

AB: Elrond - I just finish saying that Aragorn's starting threat can be a negative factor, but I'm taking the 2nd highest threat hero with this pick. This is because he is able to make up for it. Even if you only use him for Vilya, you can probably justify him because that is so powerful. He is also able to cpntribute to just about any phase of the game. Thalin, on the other hand, has limited applicability. His main role is obviously to quest, but the lone willpower just feels like a waste. Also, the single point of damage can be negligible in many cases, though it can also make an enormous impact in other quests. Overall, I think Elrond is able to make more impact a higher percentage of the time.

 

AC: Boromir (T) - Another tough choice, but I ultimately go with readying again. If Boromir's readying was limited to once or twice per round, Eleanor would probably win. Also, if Eleanor's ability didn't require you to replace the cancelled treachery, it'd fight much harder here. Tactics Boromir is just way too powerful to not win this though.

 

AD: Prince Imrahil - Another tough choice decided by readying. Beregond offers a super solid defender right out of the gate and allows a user to buff him with free/cheaper armor or weapons. Prince Imrahil, though, has decent stats in each category and has readying, so he's far more versatile and with a single attachment (Gondorian Shield) performs quite well as a defender too.

 

AE: Denethor - Bifur is a great hero because resource smoothing is important, but he has no standout stats, so he feels lackluster. Denethor, though, can defend well right away or can be a key component in an encounter manipulation deck. Both of them have very useful traits.

 

AF: Sam Gamgee - Another super close one. Pippin opens up a lot of possibilities for secrecy decks, and since I semi-recently was on secrecy kick, I've played him much more. Sam is super good for his threat, though and offers a great low threat leadership hero with built in readying and stat boosting. Those are quite limited, but even if he can't ready, his 3 willpower is amazing. Pippin is a big key to secrecy, though...

 

AG: Gandalf - Gandalf has amazing stats and a lot of wonderful toys, not to mention his ability to completely change the way you play by being neutral and being able to see the top card of your deck. Merry can work well if you need low threat and want to splash in tactics, or if you want to build a hobbit deck, or if you're trying to make Theoden worth playing, but other than that he doesn't bring much to the table.

 

AH: Haldir of Lorien - Faramir is a walking contradiction and is too difficult to build around. Haldir, on the other hand, is exactly what you want in rangers and his ability allows him to kill things safely. No contest.

 

AI: Galadriel - Galadriel is just so powerful. Locking your threat level (barring any "doom") and drawing an extra card each turn is extremely useful and opens up a lot of great deck types. Beorn is extremely powerful too, but he has much tougher drawbacks: no attachments, immune to player card effects. His built-in "readying" is great, though, and 5 base attack is insane, but I just can't take him over Galadriel, especially with such high starting threat.

 

AJ: Glorfindel (S) - Mablung looks to be potentially very powerful. Glorfindel just won't be beat, though. Mablung tends to need more cards built around him, whereas Glorfindel really just needs Light of Valinor. Also, the fact that Glorfindel is in so many decks just speaks for itself.

 

AK: Celeborn - This one is sorta tough. Celeborn is not very versatile in the types of decks he can show up in, but he is the top dog in a massively fun new faction archetype. Gimli fights quite valiantly for this spot, though, so it was tough to decide.

 

AL: Aragorn (Lo) - The threat reset is insane. It would work a lot better on a low-threat hero, but I'll take what I can get from Aragorn. Hama's recycling can be a bore some times and he's very one-dimensional. Aragorn is more versatile.

 

AM: Eomer - Dain is nothing by himself. He requires the rest of the dwarves to make a difference. Eomer isn't super versatile, but with just 1 attachment, he becomes a beast. I like beasts.

X: Legolas. Nori is good but Legolas is just one of the best heroes.

 

Y: Eowyn: Hard to decide... I like Bard a lot. But Eowyn is still now the best questing hero...

 

Z: Elrohir: Give him an Steward of Gondor, a Gondorian shield and you have provably the best defender of the game.

AB: Elrond: Nothing to say... probably it will be the more unbalanced match .

 

AC: Boromir: If Eleanor would'nt reveal another card she would win. But as they are... I think Boromir is better.

 

AD: Prince Imrahil: 0 WP sucks.

 

AE: Denethor: Until we don't get another hero with a scrying ability... he is so good at what he does.

 

AF: Sam Gamgee: Very very hard choice... I first wrote Pippin... but really, having a deep analysis Sam is just to good for it's 8 threat.

 

AG: Gandalf: Gandalf and all his toys are just... too good. And this is a signal, look at the round code... (ag, on the reverse side is (GA from Gandalf...)

 

AH: Haldir of Lorien (I forgot to vote, so I edited the post): I also like Faramir... but what you want in a ranger deck is a way to end enemies on the staging area, not a boost for having them...

 

AI: Galadriel: Sad to look this paired, as they both are amongst my favourite heroes... but I have to choose one...

 

AJ: Glorfindel: Better stats. Half threat, Asfaloth... that's too much for Mablung

 

AK: Celeborn: I'm not a great fan of Gimli, and Celeborn is the cornerstone of one of the most fun decks at the moment...

 

AL: Aragorn: Best threat control ability on the game. I'm a fan of Hama, but you had a hard match dude, sorry.

 

AM: Eomer: Looking at the numbers, stats and effectiveness, Dain is provably better. But Eomer is great, original and has good sinergies without beeing overpowered as dwarves are. My choice and one of my favourites to be in the finals.
