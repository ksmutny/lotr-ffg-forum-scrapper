When you can play more than 1 responses, can you do all immediately? or first one and second the other...? If it is the second ask... can you activate both when the response is about a same event?

2 examples:

Expert Treasure-Hunter [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/the-hobbit/on-the-doorstep/expert-treasure-hunter-otd]: your hero has got several Expert Treasure-Hunter and he has quested and won the quest. Can you activate the response of each attachment? If it can..., must you "say" one card type for all attachments or you can "say" a different card type for each attachment your hero has?

Foe Hammer [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/the-hobbit/over-hill-and-under-hill/foe-hammer-ohauh]: your hero has 2 weapons, and kills one enemy... You have got in hand one foe-hammer and exhaust one weapon to draw 3 cards. One of the new 3 is other Foe-Hammer, can you exhaust the second weapon to use the new Foe-Hammer (the response of 2nd Foe-Hammer would be after the first, but about the same event?)?

 

 

PD: sorry for my english, i'm spanish and i only speak english a little bit.

Expert Treasure Hunter: Each card is exhausted and activated individually in the order of your choosing.

 

Foe Hammer: Yes, you can use the new foe-hammer if you still have unexhausted weapon attachments. The game has not yet moved on from the triggering event.

 

Responses are always done one at a time in an order chosen by the first player (assuming they share the same triggering event)
