Can someone clarify what this setup thing actually do? 

 

Setup: each player removes the top 20 cards of his deck and places them aside, as an out-of play deck. The first player takes Mugash plus 1 Mugash`s Guard for each other player in the game and randomly shuffles one facedown into each player`s out-of play deck. Place any remaining copies of Mugash`s Guard aside, out of play.

as i see it:

shuffle your deck then take the top 20 cards and put them as a 2nd deck.

then if you are solo play, you shuffle Muagash into this new deck.

if you are multiplay, the 1st player does the above line, then each other player does the same only with a guard

I though that the first player only shufle mugash with the other bodyguard and each player took one randomly, so that we don't know wich player has Mugash.

Agree with alogos: the instructions say to shuffle Mugash with guards before adding one card to each out of play deck.  For on one person game this means you know where Mugash is hiding, but with more than one player the challenge becomes one of "draining" all the decks.

Yea. grab Mugash + 1x Mugash Guard x (num of players - 1)... then randomly distribute those 1-4 cards amongst the players' set aside decks.

So if i play single player, do i have to take only Mugash to my out-of play deck?

 

And if i play 2-player game then i shuffle Mugash and 1 guard, then each player chooses 1 card to their out-of play deck rigth?

Yes to both.
