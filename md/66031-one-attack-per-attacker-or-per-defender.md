# [One attack per attacker or per defender?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/66031-one-attack-per-attacker-or-per-defender/)

I need help with a few clarifications:

1. I know characters like boromir who can ready for multiple attacks cannot attack the same enemy multiple times… they can only ready and attack multiple enemies once. My question is, is this because:

A. Each enemy can only be attacked once a phase total?

or

B. Each character may only attack each enemy once per phase?

I'm a bit confused… and this came into play last night when I had multiple mirkwood runners. I was not sure if each of them could attack the same enemy, alone. Or, if I could only attack the same enemy once, and had to chose whether I wanted to combind the attack and not ignore defense, or only attack with one of my elves but ignore defense.

Likewise, i had a situation where glorfidel with a rivendell blade attacked, but did not defeat an enemy. I changed my mind after the attack resolved, that I actually wanted to remove the enemy from the game. I had sneak attack, but did not know if I could play it and then attack with another character to finish the enemy off, or, if I was only permitted to attack that enemy once, and the sneak attack would have been a combined attack with glorfindel.

 

Thanks

Each *player* may declare a single attack on an enemy.  So if you want multiple characters to attack the same enemy, they need to attack at the same time, or have ranged and join your co-player's attack.

Sneak Attack specifically circumvents this restriction, however.  But you are limited to a single character with this attack (no one can join in).  This is clarified in the FAQ.

I think you mean Quick Strike?

 Crap, yes, that's what I mean.  Ignore my comments about Sneak Attack. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
