Hello, I've been trying lot of quest solo with this deck and so far i manage to beat them all fairly consistently. Mirkwood, Anduin, Emyn muil, Gollum, Dol Guldur and Carrock (with a score of 117, did not track other score as i just saw the errata on number of turn for scoring recently). Still have Rosgobel to try.

Sneak attack and Gandalf seem to be the key in solo. My other deck (mix of Lore with Boromir) do not perform so well in solo play. I came to the conclusion Purple and blue are the two best sphere in solo.

Anyone had good result with different combinaison in solo?

Cheer!

Aragorn 12
Eowyn 9
Dunhere 8

Northern tracker 3
Faramir 2
Escort from edoras 2
snowborn scout 3
Eomund 3

Hi broche, welcome to the forums!

Lots of good conversation to be had here.

If you're interested in some solo deck success, I've been hosting various tournaments (including a 3rd Solo Player tournament that is still active this week) on the forums here, and you'd be most welcome to take a look and at least see what heroes people are using. Sometimes people post the full decks they used (like you did here) or other specific details too. If you click on the link to the Hall of Fame thread in my signature, you can find links to the other threads that highlight the different tournaments. Sounds like the solo ones may interest you the most. You're welcome to join in the fun too... everyone is welcome!

Interesting

I check the thread solo player tournament it look quite interesting. however, most of the deck seem to use the same combinaison of cards.

1. Eowyn: Almost a must in solo, since she worth in average 2 shadow cards in the SA by herself

2. Sneak attack/Gandalf: Gandalf is the most powerful character, and playing in multiple time proved so far to be the only way to beat high difficulty quest, and to accomplish a high score.

3. Northen tracker: Almost essential to beat heavy location deck like Anduin, Emyn muil or Gollum. And he got great stat.

I found tactic to be extremly rough to play solo. No quest questing power, no draw save for eagle cards, and no threat control...

 Yup, you nailed it.

Tactics is, obviously, all about combat. In a solo game, combat is something to be avoided, as all it does it remove characters from other important duties.

Power to the N. Tracker!

Well just used a three-color deck vs. CatC

Aragorn
Beravor
Eleanor.

With:

Events:
Lorien's Wealth (so-so)
A test of will
Galahdrim Greeting
Sneak Attack

Unexpected courage (put on beravor to draw up-to 4 extra cards or as mighty defender)
Steward of Gondor (on aragorn)
Celebrian Stone (on aragorn)
Song of wisdom (yep, you guess it)
Dunedain warning (on beravor)
Burning Brand (on beravor as well)
Protector of lorien (also on beravor - making her mighty defender with UC, easily blocks trolls)
The Favor of the lady (can be dropped, depending on quest type)

Allies:
Silverlode archer 
Sons of Arnor
Guard of the citadel
Northren Tracker
Eomund (was nice, but not a must)
Erebor hammersmith
Miner of Iron hills (great vs. sacked)
Henamarth Riversong (Allows to control the game - you know what's coming and with burning brand, no surprises)
Wandering Took
Gleowine (extra draw, but a bit week)
Longbeard mapmaker
Daughter of Nimrodel (a bit of healing)
Gandalf

Overall ~50 cards, can be tuned, but once you get the combo going, it's working great. (will probably go to more "theme" decks soon...)
