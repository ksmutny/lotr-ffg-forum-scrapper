"Attach to a hero. Response: After a character is destroyed, add 1 resource to attached hero's pool." - 1 resources is added also if a character is discarded? Like Gandalf?

It used to work like that, when it said "after a character leaves play," but it was errata'd to "after a character is destroyed." So now a character has to leave play thanks to damage (as opposed to including discard effects).
