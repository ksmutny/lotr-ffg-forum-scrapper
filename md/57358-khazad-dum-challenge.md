As soon as I saw Dain as the newest hero, it made me even more excited for Khazad-Dum. I also realized that he is our 4th Dwarf hero with 2 more on the way. I then reread the KD box and saw that thematically it is about Dwarves going to investigate what happened to Balin. With this in mind, I am issuing the:

Khazad-Dum Challenge

Objective: In a 2 player game, to go through the 3 Khazad-Dum quests and succeed. (Either normally or Nightmare mode)

Rules:

1. All heroes must be a Dwarf.

2. Between the 2 decks, there must be at least 1 copy of each Dwarf and Dwarf-related card.

3. Have fun.

I have issued this challenge to the Cardboard of the Rings podcast and they readily accepted. (Awesome podcast which you can check out here: cardboardoftherings.wordpress.com/ [http://cardboardoftherings.wordpress.com/]). I hope you all enjoy and discuss your triumphs (or tragedies) during this challenge.
