So just for curiosity, what is your favourite sphere of this game? Leadership, tactics, lore or my favourite spirit, and why?

I myself like spirit because Eowyn and Glorfindel, pretty varied cards like threat management, location handling, questing cards and many others like card drawing, condition removing and readying cards. I also use Frodo Baggins and Nori a lot (i just love to use spirit Bofur with him).


## 2 [blinky on September 2, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/120991-favourite-sphere/?do=findComment&comment=1243941)

Baggins.

 

It's just the best.

Lore, it is pretty myscelaneous

I have long been a fan of Tactics for its no-nonsense dedication to what it does.  But Lore probably has my love at the moment for its scry and encounter manipulation effects.  Lore has the highest number of cards on my list of "cards I want to play, but never do" (Out of the Wild, Risk Some Light, Needful to Know)...

## 5 [Djenni on September 2, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/120991-favourite-sphere/?do=findComment&comment=1243997)

Neutral.

 

I absolutely love neutral cards, i know it's technically not a sphere but after the announcement of the Gandalf Hero it's starting to shape up.

Lore, 

But all the cards GrandSpleen never uses, I use all the time!!!

Favourite cards: Gildor's counsil - Risk Some Light - Ravens of the Mountains- Needful to Know - Gleowine - Ithilien Tracker - Mithrandir's advice - .....

Man, that's a tough one.

 

If I have to pick just one, I'd say Leadership, because that's where the bulk of the free ally effects are. (Though, of course, the best allies to use these effects on are generally in Lore/Spirit.)

I actually made deck some time ago with all those cards ^_^ [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_happy.png] (except Mithrandir´s advice because i don´t have it...)

I think it was somekind of dwarf secrecy deck, can´t remember the quest tough what we were playing.

Tactics is probably my favorite.  I think it's partly because I enjoy combat more than questing and partly because it focuses more on attachments and events than allies.  Lore would be my second favorite because of the healing, traps, and variety in heroes.  I pretty much only use spirit for secrecy decks because I try to avoid Eowyn/Glorfindel (overpowered) and I find most of the other spirit heroes to be bland.  Leadership is definitely my least favorite sphere, largely because I try to avoid overpowered cards Steward of Gondor, Dain, Outlands, and Sneak Attack/Gandalf.  If you take out those cards Leadership doesn't bring much to the table.

At least, I wouldn't want to choose.. But my first deck was Leadership Lore and that worked back then. Never stopped working. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

My favorite sphere is probably Leadership, but Lore comes close. In fact Lore used to be my favorite but I really appreciate the theme of Leadershit, as Trololo calls it, and how it can do a bit of everything. I dislike though that it relies maybe a bit too much on Steward of Gondor, but then again it is a very good sphere at questing and fighting and putting lots of allies into play. I would definately like though if we got more powerful leadership attachments for a hero focused Leadership deck as opposed to lots of allies.

 

I developed some sort of "sphere theory", in which my thesis is that Leadership and Lore fill the gaps of Spirit and Tactics by doing the opposite things. So we all know Spirit is good at questing by having lots of willpower and Tactics is good at combat for obvious reasons. Leadership fills the gaps by strength in numbers i.e. having lots of weenies which add up to high willpower and high attack, while on the other hand Lore fills the gaps by "neutralizing" encounter cards. So lore fills the combat gap with traps and avoiding enemies, and fills the questing gap with events and allies that negate enemy and location threat. This is of course in general, since both spheres are also very good at specific things, like resource acceleration and card draw, respectively.

Tactics.  Nothing is quite as satisfying as crushing some skulls.

I understand your opinion but I think that no sphere is as powerful in questing than leadership. They just lack the ability of Northern Trackers.

Leadership: 

-Broken Sword

-Faramir

-Visionary Leadership

With these options no sphere has that much willpower as Leadership. So I'd prefer to say that (away from the fact they both quest very well) Leadership is the stronger quester, but spirit has the advantage of exploring, and the power quest boosts (lay of nimrodel/astonishing speed). Next to that cancellation is a very strong tool of spirit offcourse.

But back to the subject:

Lore - and a tie between Leadership/Tactics/Spirit.

I like low threat, something that doesn't work that great in leadership/tactics.

Last time a thread like this pop'd up i said leadership, i just like their diversity and how they can be good at a variety of different things, they also boast some of the more popular heroes as well.  I'm starting to lean towards tactics now. The game designers are always giving us new and fun ways to crush orcs and this cycle in particular has made it important for a lot of the tactics attachments such as the mounts for Rohan and the pre-existing elven weapons for all our new silvan friends

## 18 [monkeyrama on September 3, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/120991-favourite-sphere/?do=findComment&comment=1244785)

Very big fan of lore, not least because of the manipulation of the encounter deck. It's just so cool to mess with that deck, plus lore decks have lots other fun tricks.

 

That said, tactic, as Pharmboys said, is getting more and more interesting as the game goes on. And Legolas has always been a favorite hero since the game's very earliest days.

Hm, difficult to decide. I can easily pick the one that does not touch so much which is Leadership (I use it often though). I like all the other three main spheres. I will go for Tactics because I find it more challenging to build a solo mono deck to win quests than with Lore or Spirit. I could also vote for Lore but I do not use it so much because I can never decide which cards to leave outside (I end up to have to remove some 10 cards everytime) and thus to keep me out of the question I prefer not to use it that often

It is interesting that Leadership can be better at questing than Spirit with those global buffs which makes sense and is super powerful and also Dain with his buffs..

 

Anyways, Lore is still my favorite and Tactics second. A Lore/Tactics deck using card draw and Doomed cards is super powerful and can be a great support deck since you can bring so much help to the table: card draw, weapon attachments, healing and the doomed cards are also very helpful and obviously free :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Spirit and Lore. I love card effects like threat management, condition removal, effect cancellation, questing power etc. Imladris Stargazer is one of my favourite cards. Lore is great for healing and manipulating decks. I'd like to see more cards that affect the encounter deck, though.

Denethor - Gildor's counsil - Risk Some Light - Ithilien Lookout - Ravens of the Mountains - (one of the previous + Expecting mischief) - Out of the Wild - .....

And he even wants more ^^

I do! Denethor's ability is decent, but if you need him to block you won't get to use it much. You should also have Henamarth in play to make it more effective, and it makes little difference in 3-4-player games. I don't think Gildor's Counsel is worth the cost. Leaf Brooch makes it more playable, but it's still 2 resources on a gamble. Risk Some Light is probably the best card there - I'd like more like that.

## 29 [Jban on September 4, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/120991-favourite-sphere/?do=findComment&comment=1248197)

Well To be honest, I nearly ever play Denethor because I find him too expensive. My main manipulative deck start within secrecy, and I find Denethor too expensive for a 3-hero secrecy deck. 

But I think Gildor's counsil is worth it for sure! You buy off your facing encounter card, while you can still help the group with your heroes. I think it's worth to spend 3 resources you get in a round to reduce the encounter card's to a game with 1 player less. Because I play in secrecy I sometimes get to some resourcefuls which make me initially richer over a single round. But next to that I don't pay those 3 resources that often. Most of the time I'm able to combine them with some Good Meals and at that moment I think I can have a very good gameplay since your partners get a quite easy game.....

But I maby better just write an article about my most fun deck to play.

Mirlonde + Bifur + Pippin for the Win!!!

Lore, because of rangers/traps and encounter deck/staging area (radagast's cunning) manipulation. Spirit and Leadership have dropped somewhat due to the fact that i the gap between the staples and the not really playable cards is larger than in lore and tactics

## 31 [FetaCheese on September 10, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/120991-favourite-sphere/?do=findComment&comment=1257135)

A monosphere spirit two-handed solo player dressed in blue was about to play a Lotr LCG game with his fellow gamers with Glorfindel in his deck, a known overpowered card

 

”Before the game begins, you must get on your knees and worship Glorfindel and accept that he is the most useful hero the world has ever known, even greater than Dain Ironfoot!”

 

At this moment, a brave, patriotic, pro-multisphere Navy SEAL champion who had played over 1500 Gencon games and understood the necessity of 1-copy cards in the starter set and fully supported all corporate decisions made by FFG stood up and held up a card.

 

”How much willpower does Theondred have, pinhead?”

 

The arrogant spirit player smirked quite elvishly and smugly replied “a mere 1 point, you Leadershit nerd”

 

”Wrong. It’s a 5 willpower hero with Celembrian' Stone, Faramir and Sword that was Broken. If Glorfindel is the best hero in the game as you say… then it should be in the leadership sphere"

 

The spirit player was visibly shaken, and dropped his tokens and copy of Silmarilion. He stormed out of the room crying those spirit crocodile tears. The same tears elven lovers cry for the “weak cards" (who today are favored by the metagame so much, most decks are over 100+ cards strong) when they jealously try to claw justly earned tools from the other deserving spheres. There is no doubt that at this point our player, nicknamed Drizzt Do Urden, wished he had pulled himself up by his bootstraps and went back to CCGs and booster packs. He wished so much that he had a leadership deck to play with himself, but he had used all purple cards as proxies for Ethir Swordsmen!

 

The other players applauded the SEAL and all played siege and battle quests that day and accepted Dain Ironfoot as their lord and savior. An eagle named “Gwaihir" flew into the room and perched atop the American Flag and shed a tear on the quest card. The Hobbit was read several times, and Caleb himself showed up and converted all existing heroes to their Leadership versions.

 

The spirit nerd lost his deck and sold his cards the next day. He died in poverty without Steward of Gondor and was tossed into the lake of fire for all eternity.

So long as what you love doesn't have to relate to what you play the most... then I love Tactics most :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] ...but its like a super rich desert or really old distilled beverage stored in barrels... its totally awesome but only needs to be splashed to be enjoyed! (unless stomping around in Heirs of Numenor, where I got to use more tactics cards and Heroes in any given game than my entire Lotr LCG experience to date!).

Not sure if I understood what FetaCheese meant with that post. Is he saying that Glorfindel is not that good? Theodred can be 5 willpower with Celebrian's Stone, Faramir and STWB... big deal, that is a lot of setting up and used card slots while Glorfindel with a mere LoV is 3 WP and doesn't exhaust to quest, and with the same previous setup he can be 7 willpower. It's weird that I say this because Leadership is my favorite sphere and Spirit my least favorite, but trying to say that Glorfindel is not such a good hero that way is dumb. While in certain scenarios and/or decks there are better choices than Glorfindel, I'm pretty sure it's safe to assume that in general, Glorfindel is objectively the best hero in the game, at leat from an economic, numerical standpoint.

You are reading too much into it. It's mostly impartial satire.

Glori is strong. Dain beats Glorfindel however, numerically speaking. He doubles attack and questing values for dwarves and remains a good defender.

And to keep this post in the spirit of the thread, I like all spheres, but I like tactics the least. I am more interested in traits and gameplay mechanics (like elrond/vilya, caldara recursion etc, silvan bouncing etc).
