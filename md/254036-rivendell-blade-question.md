Hi,

I see that there are a lot of questions / answers associated to it but my question is simple:

Can the characterÂ attack in a group or does the character need to attack alone in order to apply the rivendell blade's effect?

Regards,

Since it does not specify attacking alone, the character can also attack in a group.
