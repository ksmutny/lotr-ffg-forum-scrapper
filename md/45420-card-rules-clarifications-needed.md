Hi got a question about 2 cards as i'm not sure if i'm playing them the right way:

 

1) Steward of Gondor -> as far as i understand i do not exhasut the hero but just the attachment to gain resources ?

 

2) United -> if i'm allowed to defend with more than one hero against same monsters i understand that i'm allowed to deal damage to my heroes as i see fit thus possibly neglecting all the dameg by combined hero defense ?

Yes to both of your questions.

1) only the attachment exhausts (sure on that)

2) You add the defense value of the defending characters and put the remaining damage on them, as you see fit (seems logical, but I'm not 100% sure if it's explained in the rules)

Don;t have the english cards so it will be a translation from polish:

 

Action -> choose player, during that phase/round (not sure wich one will be in english) that player can choose any number of his characters to defend against any enemies

 

 Basically it allows the player to defend with multipile characters against a each enemy that attacks him.

Here's the English version:

Stand Together
Type: Event Sphere: Tactics
Cost: 0

 

Action: Choose a player. That player may declare any number of his eligible characters as defenders against each enemy attacking him this phase.

I'm thinking that this means you can pick a set of characters and use their combined defense multiple times against each and every enemy that attacks this phase.

Probably not. It just seems to allow multiple characters to block one enemy. I'd say the key word here is eligible. Defending requires exhausting so after each group of characters blocks they'd all exhaust and no longer be eligible to defend against further attacks.

Yup exactly exhausted character is not eligible thus cannot defend a second time unless you can "untap" him with different effect but the question already solved i think about the card was if defence stat of characters used to defend against a single monster cumulate.

Ok, I see. They still exhaust. So if you had four unexhausted characters in play, you could use two to defend against one engaged enemy and two to defend against another. That's a great card!

Especially since you can play it without cost.
