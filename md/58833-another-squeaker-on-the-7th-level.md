 Woah!  Pulled one off on the second scenario.  There were tons of enemies.  Last combat phase took out two of my Heros and left me with just Dain iron foot and a Longbeard map-maker.  Three engaged enemies and two came out in staging, but since Dain's ability kicked my Longbeard up one and Dain had narvi's belt and steward of gondor, I enough tokens to quest out!  (otherwise 5 enemies would have killed me that round!)

Some have said this harder than scenario one.  Not sure if I agree.  But a key to this was that I had two heroes and one ally all with 3 defense.
