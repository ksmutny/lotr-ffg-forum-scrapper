I am intrigued by the phrase “After xxx enters play….”

It does not say “When”, so does the use of “after” mean that I can apply this ability multiple times/rounds as the second round of combat is still “After”.

If not when exactly is “After”?

Thanks

Phil

Responses that use the word "After" can be triggered immediately after the specified condition is met. For example, immediately after Gandalf enters play, you can trigger his response. The FAQ covers this in section 1.08 Responses Per Trigger:
 

(1.08) Responses per Trigger
If a response or forced response is triggered, the effect 
can only occur once per trigger. 
Example: Theodred (CORE 2) reads, “Response: After 
Theodred commits to a quest....” This effect can only be 
triggered once each time Theodred commits to a quest.
