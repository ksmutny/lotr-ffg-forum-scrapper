Great list, thanks for compiling this! Are there plans to add links to these quests?

I think you're missing Tales from the Cards' First Age fan expansions.

Great list. Any chance to get the link to those scenarios quest and encouter cards?

## 5 [TwiceBorn on October 23, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284967-lotr-fan-made-custom-quests/?do=findComment&comment=3511922)

Wow... I didn't realize there were so many!

## 6 [Strilar on October 24, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284967-lotr-fan-made-custom-quests/?do=findComment&comment=3513836)

I've added the links to the respective quests, just click on their names. ?

Also added a few more quests i found to the list including the part 2, 3 and 4 of the First Age - Doom Mastered Cycle.

Eventually i'll add more info to each one as well (expansions needed, difficulty rating, etc).

This list is over 2 years old, so i probably missed any recent fan-made quests if any new one was made in the meanwhile. (Hence the 1st age ones missing)

There's an old list on BGG but terribly outdated, so let me know if you find any more custom content like these so we can add them to this list.

Do any of you guys/gals take fan-made quests seriously. What I mean is do you print them out on paperboard or the like? I'm thinking of doing just that.

What kind of paper do you print on? Any tips?

I once did a small undead quest, I think it was mainly to challenge myself on doing a quest almost completely consisting off MtG art. Needless to say it's pretty lore-hostile, despite me trying to use stuff that was actually in the lore (at least mentioned). I think we tried it once with the Seastan and it proven to be too hard and punishing.

Here's the cards if anybody cares to look: https://imgur.com/a/51HvklA [https://imgur.com/a/51HvklA]

I personally have no interest in printing the quests, even though for stuff like the first age expansion you can easily get the pdfs.

These type of quests really lent themselfs to OCTGN as it is much easier to download than to print, cut and maybe even glue and sleeve the cards (not even mentioning the colours can be completely off/different from what you expect)

If the quest "just" throws together different encounter cards (what can make for awesome quests as the pool is even larger than for player cards) I might do that, but even in this case the hassle to pick sometimes only 1 or 2 from an expansion is far greater than just to play it on OCTGN.

I do print some of the quest, but only on paper. Then I playtest some of them, and they usually are closer to cycle one difficulty rate than Print On Demand. So it wasn't interesting enough to me.

John -> Did you know how to make a OCTGN files from you quest? If you say it is difficult I'm willing to try it :). If you don't know how to do this could you send me the files so I can see if I can work on it? Thanks.

As Calvadur say it is way more easy to play on OCTGN with scenario you will play only once in a while :).

I had it made as an OCTGN quest originally, that's how we with Seastan tested it in the first place: https://www.dropbox.com/s/nfjps1806syxg4p/Undead Quest.rar?dl=0 [https://www.dropbox.com/s/nfjps1806syxg4p/Undead%20Quest.rar?dl=0]
