I'm currently playing The Hunt for Gollum and I have a question. the 1B quest card reads:

Forced: After the players quest successfully, the first player looks at the top 3 cards of the encounter deck. Reveal and add 1 of those cards to the staging area, and discard the other 2 cards.

My question is this, if the willpower of the committed characters is equal to the threat of the cards in the staging area, is this considered a successful quest?

No, you need WP > threat to be successful. Also note that IIRC, it was ruled that the Forced goes off even if you would complete the stage (it triggers between check for success and place progress tokens).

Thanks :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] what does IIRC mean?

I know... it's silly... I hate them too.

I don't hate them, I just didn't understand, thanks for the clarification :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Not sure about that last bit, can you remember where or when that ruling was discussed?

Rulebook p14 under "Quest Resolution"

"If the [Willpower Symbol] is higher, the players have successfully quested, and they make progress on the quest."

I read "higher" as meaning ... well.... higher. i.e. NOT Higher than or Equal to..

Cool... we have to change our ways a bit I noticed. Makes sense though.
We've been wondering about that part as well.
