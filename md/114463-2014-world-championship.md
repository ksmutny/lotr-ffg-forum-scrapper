World Championship [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=5011]

 

I put my glasses on but I don't see Lord of the Rings LCG.

Then why even create this thread?

LOTR doesn't have organized tournaments like World Championship. Never had one.

 

They are in a separated category with Descent 2n Edition.

 

What they DO have is a Fellowship Event, in October 10th-12th. This is a new event (from this year).

Then why do even reply to this thread?

 

The intention was to make a point so FFG see that LotR community is not a secondary LCG. But if all players agree to stay at low profile I won't make any more complains.

 

Sorry I this thread had offended anyone.

The point was made numerous times before. Also, they do not read the forums.

Caleb has stated many times that he does read the forums. It's how he meta games the quests in order to challenge popular strategies.

That said I don't believe that this game works in a tournament format and I think FFG agrees.

I wonder what Caleb has to do with anything related to tournaments.

I'm sure there will be a side event, wait for the side events posts that they mentioned will come soon.

 

If not many of us will bring our cards and make a side event of our own join in :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

If you check a rule book there is info about Tournaments deck. From begin designers plan to make tournament but with a time they understood it will be to difficult. Now they come with idea of this specula event. Wny not? But i participate  one tournament in Paris 6 months ago and i believe there is system to make kind of special organise play for this game. Will see how FFG will make this even in Oktober.
