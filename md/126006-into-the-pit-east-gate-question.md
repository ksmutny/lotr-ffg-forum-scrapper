Good morning,

 

I am currently questing on Into the Pit from Khazad-dum expansion.

 

The East gate location prevent you from engaging enemies.

 

However, I drew the attachment (on an enemy) Ithilien Pit, which allows any character to attack that enemy (I believe in play and in the staging area, please correct me if I am wrong)

 

My LOTR card game instincts tell me the Ithilien pit card will take precedense and characters are indeed allowed to attack.

 

Could a kind soul confirm this for me, please.

 

Many thanks in advance.

You don't have to engage an enemy in order to attack it, if you do so via card effects.  If you have Ithilien Pit attached to an enemy in the staging area, you can attack it.  Hands Upon the Bow, Dunhere, or Forth Eolingas! are other cards that you could use to do this.

Many thanks. I'm glad my assumption was correct.
