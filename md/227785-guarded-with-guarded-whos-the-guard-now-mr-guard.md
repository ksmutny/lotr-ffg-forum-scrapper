# [Guarded with guarded (who&#039;s the guard now, mr. guard?)](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/227785-guarded-with-guarded-whos-the-guard-now-mr-guard/)

Ok, during our journey to Rhosgobel last night, I revealed Athelas from the encounter deck (which has Guarded keyword), and as its guard, I revealed another Athelas.

 

Obviously, my question is - is the first Athelas now unguarded and free to claim and the second Athelas has drawn another encounter card as its guard, or do I have to draw another guards for each Athelas separately?

 

I resolved it the easy way, because we were losing anyways (thanks UNGOLIANT'S SPAWN!), but I'd like to know if there is any official standpoint as I was too dumb to find it myself.

 

Thanks and happy questing,

 

Gorkil the goblin king

I do not know any official rulings, but in that case I'd reveal two more cards. So each guarded card has its own guard.

This is covered on page 24 of the core rulebook: "If another objective card comes up while attaching a card for the guarded keyword, place the 2nd objective in the staging area, and use the next card of the encounter deck to fulfull the original keyword effect." That's not crystal clear, but what it means is that the first Athelas won't be unguarded. Instead, you'll draw and place cards as follows:

 

1) First Athelas. Place in staging area. Draw for its Guarded, and get...

2) Second Athelas. Place in staging area. It also has Guarded, which we'll get to later after we've finished resolving the Guarded effect from #1. Draw for Guarded #1, and get...

3) Some enemy. Place it guarding Athelas #1. Now we resolve Athelas #2's Guarded keyword. Draw for Guarded #2, and get...

4) Some location. Place it guarding Ahtelas #2. We're done.

 

Note that if either card #3 or #4 had been a treachery, you would have resolved the treachery and then the corresponding Athelas card would have been unguarded and free to claim.

I was confused by the rulebook a bit, figured I'd play it the easy way (which led to our inevitable doom by Exhaustion and Ungoliant's Spawn) Thanks, I was browsing this forum for at least an hour prior to creating my topic and did not find the topic you linked... Thank you tons for the clarification mate!
