Â 

Â 

For anyone that hasn't seen it yet. This looks great, not only do we get the answer of when the first pack was being released but we get news of the second at the same time. For those that already have the first do you know if it's compatible with the Mirkwood build your own scenerios that came out before?Â 

It seems like they are going to be making these packs for all of their cycles, something I am totally down with and would love to see some reimagined cards from the realms each cycle created (also mostly Dream-Chaser so FFG you guys can skip ahead if you want a bit haha).

Anyhow it's not the final two packs but it is something and gives me hope for more content as we await Spirit Aragorn and news of what comes next at the end of the year.Â

I believe the encounter sets would be compatible with the Mirkwood sets. Â 

Not the quest cards though. Â 

Edit: Â just me guessing I donâ€™t have the Gencon packÂ

The encounter set numbers I see are 1,12,15,18 -- all of which were used in King's Quest/Woodland Realm.Â  So that's a practical impediment to mixing, while the thematic difference between forest/underground may also pose a problem.Â  But mechanically it looks very much the same, so mixing the four packs should be possible.

Is there an alternate hero art with this one?

The Mirkwood encounter cards have a green ring and the Moria ones an orange one, so you could still distinguish them. This means, technically you can mix them, though it does not make much sense thematically.

Just say you are in the forest next to Moria, and there are caves everywhere... that also have trees... don't take this from me! Hahaha

Negative, none of the sold packs have them. Only ones released at fellowship or gencon eventsÂ

I hope they continue this trend for the other cycles, though I don't expect it. I would love to see an Osgiliath version of this!

As someone who is still a rather new player, can anyone give me a quick synopsis of how these work?Â  I haven't looked too much into the past Print on Demand scenario packs beyond Massing, Lake-Town, and Stone of Erech, but I take it these and the Woodland Realm / Wizard's Quest are a bit different in that they allow for customizing a quest by assembling different collections of encounter decks each time?Â  Is it purely at the play group's discretion, or does FFG provide some recommended options for mixing or is it meant to be totally random when you get the Quest ready?

Also, are these packs likely to be the quests used in the Spring 2020 Fellowship Events, or will that be something different?

Thanks much for helping out an overwhelmed newbie.

1) FFG provides some recommendations for constructing a quest and also some rules (no more than 3x of the same card, IIRC).Â  Besides grouping the encounter cards into little mini-sets, each individual card has a point value, so you can construct quests just by grouping together sets, or by picking out individual cards of the appropriate point values -- the instructions spell this out in detail.

2) Mines of Moria was used at GenCon last year, and Escape From Khazad-Dum is supposed to be used at the mysterious 2020 Fellowship Event.Â  In the 2018 Fellowship Event another player and I just played together cooperatively rather than do the competitive thing, so if the fellowship event ever materializes you don't necessarily need to play it competitively.

It is weird to me that they are offering up the fellowship event pack before they have even announced the fellowship event itself.

Or you could tell me that they completely forgot that they didn't run one last year and I wouldn't be surprised at this point.

Having Mines of Moria they seem to be separated, The Wizard's Quest + The Woodland Realms go together (as a sort of remake of Shadows of Mirkwood) and the same is true for The Mines of Moria + Escape from Khazad-Dum (as a sort of remake of Khazad-Dum + Dwarrowdelf)

At least this confirms there will indeed be a 2020 fellowship event! ðŸ™„

Does this mean we'll get the last two AP's in VoM at the same time? How cool would that be.ðŸ˜Ž

This is exactly what struck me about this announcement.Â  To me, sadly enough, it suggests that there isn't going to be a fellowship event.Â
