New article up discussing campaign mode for the upcoming black riders expansion.  i like the idea of the extra set up cards but wish we could have seen the back of it since the "resolution" kept being referenced but not actually seen.  Some pretty cool art on the card too.  The campaign log seems nice too, it would really clutch if they made it online like the quest log although they didnt seem to mention they had plans for it

 

also a nice idea of replacing heroes and making permanent choices, the more this game relies on choice and consequences the better, really gives weight to the decisions.  I cant wait to send theodred to his untimely death once we get to the rohan areas! (whats wrong with me?)

 

thoughts?

very nice indeed. i like the fell rider art-makes a nice change.

i would rather see the log like it is on paper rather than online, or both, but certainly not just online

..for some reason logging things online just annoys me....or least did because of the old forum. i think its put me off for life haha

 

this seems like it will be the best expansion to date!

As i say before really cool! This campaigne mode will replace stuoid and annoying and boring idea of nightmare mode in core set rulebook. Looks like they designers try to fix all the problem........ Very cool! BR should be as awesome as was briliant HON and NIghtmare quests of the core set.

i didnt mean to sound like i wanted it soley online, just it would have been another nice option.  i generally dislike paper ha.  looks to be a really great expansion, will be happy to see more player cards too

 

someone also noted on BBG that the campaign log has 18 spot in it...so if each box is 3 quests each, thats 6 total saga expansion (as was pretty much speculated)

Hopefully one 5-6 difficulty level scenario and 2 hard ones.  I hate when you get your brand new quest and are all exited and then BOOM! you beat it right away no problem.  I like the quests were you have to keep working and you never know if you will win or not.  I'm hoping this is the case with BR.

I'm a bit sad we didn't get to see anymore player cards, but I guess that's mostly good. If they spoil too many then it would ruin the suspense I suppose.

Love, love, love the campaign mode. I think it further deepens the niche they are working towards with this Rings LCG. I hope to see more 'RPG-ish' stuff like this as the game progresses.

## 9 [danpoage on July 10, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86123-a-hard-road-preview/?do=findComment&comment=811668)

I absolutely agree. The thematic and storytelling aspects, along with deep strategy, are what make this game great. It is very encouraging to see the designers embrace the game's strengths and actively work to play to those strengths.

Holy crap! The rules insert's gonna be huge!

i love getting extras in the box, the more the better....feels like you get more than usual haha

Well in 1 word: Fantastic. I really like the idea of the Fallen heroes, it goes really well with Tolkien lore. The Fell Rider seems really nasty and that's only 1 of the 9. It would be very exciting and thematic to have all 9 black riders on the board (of course that would mean an inmediate and painfull death). Really eager to get this expansion.

I wish we got at least a couple player cads though...lately we've been getting really few of those...last 5 articles only 1 spoiled player cards...

agreed. im really looking forward to seeing some favourites in this pack

I agree! It's like buying a completely different game, or a real expansion (something that's more than just a bunch of new player and encounter cards.

This looks awesome. I really like the idea of being able to switch out heros if needed . . . but facing consequences for that decision. Sweet!

Good lord. This is all very exciting, but now I'm worried about keeping up with all the gaming! Having trouble enough playing Druadan Forest (still waiting) and building the decks I have in mind. Now a campaign! And one that sounds so well thought out. This game is becoming a life-style choice!

The Clash were "the only band that matters", LOTR LCG is "the only game that matters"  ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

This is my way. Mostly i play only one game. Like ME ccg before Lotr tcg and now Lotr lcg. So i have all product which is release for today and will buy all new product as well. I really serious about this game is my favorite.

And good critics to designers only make it better.

But i must to say they make a good job for now.  I love idea of Compaigh and easy normal Nighmare mode but......what i dont like : we get easy and normal straight away and need to wait for nightmare for years after!
