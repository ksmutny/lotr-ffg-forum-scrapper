 Are there going to be tournaments for LOTR:LCG in which official scores can be maintained and recorded?  Other than comparing to my prior games, I don't have a sense of whether or not scores for games I'm playing are average, good, or ridiculous.

BTW, there wouldn't be an app for Android or something to help track game progress and catch infractions, would there?  My friend and I are getting better at catching ourselves before breaking game rules, but sometimes we do silly things, like forgetting Elanor can't cancel "When Revealed" effects on Enemy cards.  I sometimes forget to get my resource point for Theodred when he is committed to a quest.  Stuff like that... would be nice to have an app help manage such details.  I know... it would be better to just remember the rules.  They are not that hard.  ;?)

I may be in the minority, but I find the current scoring system to be utterly and complete useless. The current system favors a certain deck archetype (recursive threat reduction), and encourages a boring and repetitive game style.  Such a deck, when it wins, routinely posts negative score totals.  The scoring system doesn't assess how well you did, so I wouldn't worry to much about how your rank.  The game doesn't have a viable metric for allowing competitive comparison of results, and until we get one no tournament style play is really possible.

Very true what you say. Sometimes i really wonder how FFG run the process. Almost any aspect have some problems.....

Lets hope they will fix it properly.

I agree, the scoring system encourages people to play spirit with Galadrims/Dwarven Tomb/Gandalf/Stand and Fight/Sneak Attack and draw the game out as long as possible to recuce threat, get victory points, etc. 

On that note, I just completed HfG using Eowyn/Legolas/Theodred and scored 11...pretty happy about that as I tried a new deck using Radagast and eagles, so I wasn't expecting a great score.

 I wonder if I am playing the game correctly.  When I am playing (all 2 player games so far), I have never gotten to where I am reducing threat.  I'll take a look at the kinds of deck you mentioned for the kind that reduces threat so well.  We are talking 50 card decks, right?  I've not yet played a scenario where I get through more than a fifth of my playing card deck.

Am I missing something basic about the game dynamics?

Let me rephrase that... I have reduced threat playing Gandalf or Galadrim's Greeting, but not to the point of taking it lower than I start the scenario with.

BTW, I think any scoring system should some how account for remaining resource tokens.  Coming out at the end fat with resource tokens and other good end-of-game qualities should count for something.

Oh it's not hard, just a little Lore for a better card draw and at least 2x Will of the West and off you go ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] (Although it becomes harder with the Stand and Fight Errata)

I hope they do some great organized events at stores.  As far as top scores nationwide...I think they should keep high scores to store locations because I think there will be drama over cheating.  I guess that possibility could be avoided if judges were extremely tested on rules with online tests.  Some gaming companies have a multiple choice test that has to be done in less than an hour, then the person must get a certain percentage on the test to get certified.  There's usually a big enough question pool that if it's taken again you'll get different questions and usually there's a certain amount of time that must pass before it can be taken again.  Of course I've seen people who have pasted tests like this and still don't know basic rules.  It's one of the shortcomings of having the test being able to be taken at home with the internet available for the answers to be searched online.

Don't forget Galadrim's Greeting/Dwarven Tomb combos (along with Will of the West, of course).
