i would love to see a third dwarf tactics hero….i really want to make a mono sphere tactics dwarf killing deck to pair with a questing deck to play two handed. but right now this is impossible.

other races i could understand, but given the power and fighting synergy of the dwarves right now, its frustrating that were 1 hero off being able to do it

right now im pair gimli and thalin with bifur as a low threat hero who can be given narvis belt and burning brand as defense….its ok i guess, but nowhere near as powerful as other tactics decks ive played.

what do we think…any chance of getting one soon? i have a feeling after hobbit II we wont see dwaves for a long time

As much as I would now rather see any other but Dwarf hero, I think we are bound to get at least two more in this second Hobbit. And since there was Beorn as Tactics and the only non-Dwarf hero in the first pack (of course not counting the saga-only Bilbo Baggins), I have a hunch there will be a Dwarf Tactics hero in the second pack. Although it is hard not to imagine Bard as a Tactics hero, and surely we will get him I hope.

well we are yet to see balin and i think that he at least deserves hero status amongst thorins co.

as much as we have seen so many dwarf cards, i think i shall rather miss them. still roll on gondor……..happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]

How about Thorins brother Frerin for a tactics hero? Could be a 2,2,2,4 hero but gets an extra attack point if Thorin is in play. Just a thought.

I'd like to see a tactics hero with a threat of 8 or lower -- currently 9 is the lowest in tactics.  Makes it harder to "fly under the radar," which is a useful strategy for the first several turns in some quests.  And to make rich happy, let's make it a dwarf!

To sidetrack a bit, if there is a Dwarf Tactics hero, what would Bard be, Leadership? Why not, being a king and all, but the Black Arrow has been spoilt as Tactics event, hmm…

 Then what would Thranduil be? If we see him as a hero of course. Or Gwaihir, for that matter (though I pray to the gods we don't see him as a hero).

Why not?
