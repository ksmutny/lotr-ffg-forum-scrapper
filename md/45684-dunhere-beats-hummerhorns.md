Howdy. There's a hummehorns in play, and I've got dunhere. Gonna one shot it with Dunhere and take no damage, or does dunhere's 'attack' count as Hummerhorns 'engaging' me, which would result in 5 damage to a hero?

 

Thanks!

Well, basically yes.

Just keep in mind that before Dunhere can shoot, there is the encounter phase where you have to check whether or not the hummerhorns engage. Should the check fail and you didn't optionally engage them, Dunhere is free to shoot gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]

That's exactly how we deal with Hummerhorns.  And goblin snipers and wargs!happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]

 Ghetto blast those stupid bees. Dunhere rides up and proper murders them.  My teammate did that tonight. 

Dunhere can attack enemies in the staging area without them becoming engaged. Why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free?
