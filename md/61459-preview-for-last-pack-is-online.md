 That is so exciting! I wish it were being released this week. This adventure pack just pushed me off the fence of whether to get the Dwarrodelf cycle or not. I was considering just waiting to see what the next cycle was about, but this sounds too epic to pass up!

 And one of the Elven rings! I kind of hope it's just an Objective Card, rather than every Fellowship from now on going out equipped with one.

sounds like it wil be a player card- i sort of see what theyre doing- it would be a far stretch to let us kill a balrog so theyre giving us narya to make it more 'realistic'- at least i assume its gandalfs, and not elronds or galadriels- though i suppose elrond could have let us 'borrow' it for a while lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif]

dont know what to think about that- anyways pumped to whoop that balrog (or not...whats the difficulty gonna be 11?)

NOTE THE SUBTLE HINT- the ring of power will increase threat!!!! by alot im guessing

About the Treachery (Whip Lash), I'm going to go with a quote in Eric Cartman voice:

"Hella weak!"

 Who knows, maybe we cannot kill the balrog.......maybe we have to finish

the quest while he is engaged with us ( killing those poor Snowbourne Scouts)

and we have to flee like fools.....

Whip lash makes me think they they have read my mind and are stealing my custom scenario I am working on!!! I wanted to surprise people, but after seeing whiplash I wanted to just tell yo uguys in case it IS what i am trying and I didn;t want my scenario to look derivative..

Anyway it is a quest series that end in a final awesome battle with a ubr powerful foe.. but unlike most quest the quest card is in fact a monster, and the encounter deck is the monster abilities.. so instead of drawing a goblin card you draw a type of attack with a auto engage effect, locations are dodging and positioning to give bonuses to attack various part of the monster...

Either way... this new card looks awesome.. I can not wait for Darowdelf,, I am just hanging to play this... Khaz was kind of liek a holding pattern for me.. like it was cool.. but the entire thing felt like i as just getting "ready" for the real quests.. Darowdelf is going to be great I can feel it!

Couple of months before some share the info about all the packs of this s cycle but ffg very quick deleted all info from the forum. So i already knew before we will meet Balrog in the last pack. Actually i love this cycle is much better than first one and the first pack  is diffcult 6 is mean they make it more challenge and the last should be 9 same as Osgiliath. Cool!!!! love it!!!! And hope will will not get some really boring and easy quests like DM or HOEM.....

this is my prediction for how we deal with the balrog-

we have to find narya ring and equip it- then the balrog can only be damaged by use of the ring, however when we use it we 'draw saurons gaze' as ffg state and get something like a +10 threat on our counters.......this then brings in our new secrecy keyword to keep threat low and still be able to deal with other problems by buying normal player cards........single hero deck anyone???

I think we cannot kill Balrog. Just maybe we can make some damage to him( and ring should help with it, Ring will be objective card i suppose) and after we have chance to run from Moria or some..........

yes, or perhaps we have to deal damage to the bridge of khazad dum?? though how it gets repaired before the fellowship comes through i dont know

or something like it, i cant really think of another way to escape a balrog........

and hey-ho, it appears ambiguous as to whether the balrog has wings.  Hats off, FFG, hats off.

 I'm pretty sure we'll have to escape the Balrog or die. Being able to fight him and plainly hurt him seems a bit overpowered to me... Also, putting one of the Three into play seems dangerous for the respect of the theme... I hope they came up with a fine mechanism for that.

 

Like, for example : Narya - Attachement - Attach to Gandalf only. +1 to def (+4 to def if attacking enemy is a Balrog) While attached to Gandalf, this ally is not discarded at the end of the turn, but cannot be commited to a quest, nor attack. He can only defend. gran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif]

you may be right with gandalf part

'will it finally be time for the Ring’s owner to draw openly upon its power? Can you risk drawing the Eye of Sauron?'

Maybe (and most probably) owner refer to the player.

I'd hope it's something that can only be attached to a character like Gandalf (I personally think, if we do see Elrond, he'll have an ability that forces his discard at the end of the round) or only allows you to use it in this scenario (though as it's a player card and not an objective, I doubt this will be possible). Definitely don't want to see it being overly powerful and so on.
