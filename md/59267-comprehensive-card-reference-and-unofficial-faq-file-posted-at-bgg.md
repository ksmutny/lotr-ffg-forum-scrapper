# [Comprehensive Card Reference and Unofficial FAQ file posted at BGG](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59267-comprehensive-card-reference-and-unofficial-faq-file-posted-at-bgg/)

On BGG there is a file called "Lord Of the Rings Comprehensive Card Reference and Unofficial FAQ" posted. For those of you who have not seen it, here is the link:

FAQ [http://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/66894/comprehensive-card-reference-unofficial-faq]

The file attempts to answer FAQ's and interpretation issues on a card by card basis.

The idea of this file is something that can help any new player. Taking each card, one by one, and addressing any issues with the card (errata) or FAQs that have come up on it (including those posted on FFG) is amazing. I use this file each time I play. When i have a question on a specific card, I look it up using this document.

I have been told to beware files like these as sometimes they are incorrect in their handling of the rules. This file in particular has been said to have many issues with regards to its handling of the rules. You can see those comments on the link I posted. The owner of the file is handling the updates as he gets those comments.

Most will dismiss it because of the "unofficial" label. However, the document has been helpful to me and as long as updates are being made to fix errors as they are found, I will continue to use it.

a few weeks ago i thought about creating an entirely interactive faq website that looked nice and you could quickly find and sort all errata and combo issues....but i knew i wouldnt keep up with updating it so looks like someone beat me to it

I have been told it is not entirely correct. Perhaps you could go thru it and correct any mistakes.

well while there are some grey areas its certainly a useful tool when used alongside this forum and the official faq....if something hasnt been officially confirmed my philosophy is use as many sources as possible before deciding on a ruling.

I agree 100%. Which is why i typically have this document open as well as the official FAQ, Rule book, and the FFG LOTR:LCG Forum. Many a question has been answered mid-game!

Here is an example of the best FAQ I have ever seen.

 

http://nf.s3rvant.com/?mode=fullpics [http://nf.s3rvant.com/?mode=fullpics]

 

It's for an awesome game called Nightfall and I believe it's maintained and updated by the game's designer David Gregg. I would love to have a Living FAQ just like this for LotR.

While I don't expect FFG to put something like this together, I don't see why some super-fan can't create a Geeklist like this for this game. It's a fantastic example of what can be done. There is even a portable version that looks great on my iPhone.

 I'm the creator and maintainer of the referenced document.  It is certainly not perfect and a bit of work but I do find it necessary to play the game myself.  I do monitor the forum here and on BGG to address FAQs, changes, etc.  If there are any errors in the document all I need is a convincing argument to change it (usually a forum discussion I might have missed).  What you don't see in the PDF is that I started tracking the source of all of my "rulings".  Almost all of the document is officially confirmed last I checked, but there are some entries that are still my educated guesses at this point.  I will occasionally send in lists of unconfirmed questions to FFG and they do seem to turn up in future FAQs although I never hear from them directly.

Right now I'm a little behind on adding the newest expansions, but I'll get there.  

I'm glad everybody likes it and please help me correct any errors you might find in there.
