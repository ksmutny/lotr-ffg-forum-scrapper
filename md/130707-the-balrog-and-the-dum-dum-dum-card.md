Hi everybody,

I'm playing the second quest of the expansion 'The road darkens' (great...)

and I have a doubt:

how many time does the Balrog attack?

at the moment that the dum dum dum card have no damage the balrog is in game and at the end of the research phase it attacks the player.

then there is the voyage.

and what happens in the encounter phase?

a second attack?

if  it is  so... is undefendeble....!! 

help please... :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

He will attack!!

I asked this question myself and got an official response, see the thread here [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/124771-does-the-balrog-attack-right-after-coming-into-play-journey-in-the-dark/?hl=%2Bdoom+%2Bdoom+%2Bdoom].  The answer was that you have to resolve the encounter card from top to bottom, in that order, so you will have to resolve the second effect (the attack) after the Balrog has entered play.

 

It's a hard quest!
