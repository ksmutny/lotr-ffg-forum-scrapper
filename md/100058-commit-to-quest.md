When you "commit a character to quest" dose this happen individually? Or at the moment you exhaust them? Or do you exhaust them all and then at once they all commit?Â Longbread Elder peaks at the top of the encounter deck is this a way to sneak a look before you have fully committed all your people?

First player choose wich characters quest, then they are all considered commited to quest, he can then proceed to do response in any order.

Then it's the next player's turn.
