In The Haunt for Gollum on stage 2 at the beginning of the quest phase I look at the 2 top cards of the encounter deck, I reveal and add 1 of those ,  Signs Of Gollum  , an objective, discarding the other, then resolving the keyword Guarded in the text I reveal another  Signs of Gollum . Next I reveal one card to guard the first objective with the keyword surge ( I hate Eastern Crows !) so I reveal another card, putting it in the staging area. At the end I reveal a card to guard the second objective. 5 cards in a row!

Have i play in the right way?

Yes you are right. Now you can go to the quest... and reveal a card for the classic reinforcement ^^.
