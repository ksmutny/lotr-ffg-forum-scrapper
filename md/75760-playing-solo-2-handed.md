# [Playing solo, 2 handed](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/75760-playing-solo-2-handed/)

1)Get your mind out of the gutter

2) Since I have tried to teach the game to someone else I thought it would be fun to play 2 handed and use all those "Wandering Took" type cards that only work when playing wth others.  So I set myself a challenge: to play "story mode" using only cards provided for the story.  Core set was pretty easy, Mirkwood is always straight forward and incredibly easy with 2 decks and 6 heroes.  Anduin actuall gave me the most trouble mainly due to an unlucky draw (2 hill trolls and the mash adder).  Dol Guldur was surprisingly easy with 2 decks.

So then I said off to the Mirkwood cycle.  HFG was a little tougher than my solo play, mainly b/c Mordor Hunters kept poping up, but after some adjustments to my deck it turned out ok.  But I am stuck on Carrock! 
Deck 1 is Legolas/Bard/Denethor with mainly eagles cards and Radagast and of course Miners of the Iron Hills for sack cards.  My other deck is Theodred/Eowyn/Frodo built around the Rohan cards.  My plan is to play each scenario find what works, what doesnt and try and make a deck that will run through all 6 quests with no adjustments.  I know I need certain cards like Shadow of the Past for the 6th quest so I need to save room for those guys.

So I guess my questions for the community are:

1) Who plays solo 2 handed?

2) Has anyone played through the Mirkwood cycle in this "story mode" style

and

3) How the heck did you do it?

 

Any help would be appreciated.

I dunno what you mean by story mode, but I have played through the Mirkwood cycle two handed with decks using cards from the core & first 3-4 packs from Mirkwood. I have 2 cores too. I cannot remember what I did exactly as it was about a year ago.

The heroes were Legolas, Beravor & Denethor / Eowyn, Theoden & Dunhere plus using bits & bobs of allies mostly from the core set & 6 Gandalfs (ie no eagles & no Rohan theme). I did consciously use the best cards available (IMO) & I was carrying 3 Lore of Imladris just for the Rhosgobel scenario. 

The only difficult scenarios were Dol Guldur & Return to Mirkwood which I would lose more than win while the others I could lose occasionally with bad draws (2 clues & 3 Hunters from Mordor etc).

I guess this is not very useful to you other than to know that it is possible - I will try to find the deck lists.

What I mean by "story mode" is not intrerupting the game to change your deck.  So the deck you build must be able to play all 6 scenarios. And one day just running through all 6 scenarios straight and the only card changing/shuffeling is the encounter deck.

Good luck doing more than a couple of scenarios without resetting your deck! Well without using a lot of healing & Will of the West.

i think the main problem is not carrock in the mirkwood cycle but rhosgobel- one of the worst 'build for' quests out of them all. i dont think its currently possible

I think Conflict at the Carrock is actually one of the few scenarios which is easier with one deck.  If you try to engage the trolls with tactics heroes and axes swining, you are going to get mauled.  I was frustrated with this scenario until I saw a guy on youtube do it.  It occurred to me that a stealth team will have a much better chance.  The trick is to keep your threat ultra low and engage the trolls one at a time with overwhelming force.  Spirit works best, but leadership is needed to hire that one ally.  I also think that forest snare in the Lore deck is good for catching the trolls.  I visualize the scenario as a bunch of dim witted trolls wandering around their camp until (thump!)  one disappears,…. another goes to investigate (Whump!)  that one disappears into the shadows.  So on and so forth until all 4 have been neutralized.

One scenario I would try with an all hobbit deck when pippen comes out.

I believe that flightmaster means is not changing cards from your deck and not leave the table as it is…

true, I remove damage and reset threat and reshuffle the player deck.  I just mean that I want to use the same player deck for the entire journey.

Hello,

I've started yesterday playing this game, lost the first time in the first quest but the second time as I understood more, it was pretty straightforward (shame I didn't count the points though!)

anyway I read this and thought about it while I was playing, to do the same thing, organise two decks and play by meself, but how do you organise your cards on the table efficiently without getting confused?

***Update***

In case anyone cares I finally got through the Carrock two handed.  It seemed much simpler with a single deck.  I got throught 1B in one turn and had a low threat and didnt draw a bunch of enemies so I was able to get allies out and squash trolls one at a time with the help of Legolas, Support of the Eagles, and well… eagles.  I also drew Gandalf and sneak attack along with a couple forest snares.  So all in all it took a near perfect draw on player cards and encounter cards.  I even managed to get through a Hill Troll thanks to forest snares on the Louis and Morris.

I did make it to JTR which I  ***almost*** won on the first run.  I has 11 tokens on 2B and 12 damage on Wilyador when my draw (I kid you not) was:  Athelas, Athelas, Exhaustion, Athelas, Festering Wounds, Hummerhorns.  Killed Eowyn, Brand son of Bain and Denethor.  Game freaking over enfadado [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_scripts/ckeditor/plugins/smiley/images/enfadado.gif]

I think I need some treachery cancellaiton for JTR which by my estimation means that expert mode (as its called in the rules) is not even possible in the chapter pack series.

And my appologies, but I have been calling "expert mode" "story mode".  So sorry for the confusion.

I would not have known what that was either I was just being a  bit dim. But it is possible to do the first 9 quests that way as I have done. A second core sure helps if you do not have a lot of other cards but bloodymindedness would too as I did it fairly easily so there is some margin.

 

I too find the Carrock is easiest if you hit the trolls with a lowish threat & take them one at a time. You do not want to rush though as you want a decent number of guys to stil quest & block while killing them fast. You also can do it by taking the whole thing very slowly & having a vast legion when you get to the Carrock, with Grimbeorn at its head (I have not got him out in SP but he's sometimes there MP).

 

 

Another tip for playing 2 handed is to sleeve your player decks in different sleeves so that its immediately obvious what pile of cards is what. Other than that left hand vs right hand with the bad guys in the middle works fine.

Once I realized the game was primarily being designed for 2-players I decided to play double-fisted exclusively. I found too many of the AP's were very random when played truly solo; a victory or loss was too dependant on luck of the draw.

I also really like the synergy betwen two decks and cards like "ranged" and "sentinel" that make character like Haldir more meaningful.

## 16 [Autobot Tran on December 20, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/75760-playing-solo-2-handed/?do=findComment&comment=736955)

ive been playing for a few months now and always play 1 handed solo. I tried playing 2 handed once when i first started but it was way too much to keep track of. At the begining i was always forgetting to increase my threat at the end of the turn then halfway through the turn i would forget if i put resources on my heroes and all sorts of things.

There is a lot to keep track of if your playing solo in this game, but now that ive been playing for awhile i want to try 2 handed solo. None of the quests right now are particularly hard… ive had a lot of luck with HoN, if i played it more itll probably start to beat my up but i got a few lucky turns. anyway I think itll make the game easier, which isnt necessairly what im looking for but its also not necessairily bad. Playing two handed will give access to 6 heroes instead of just 3 (i hate being limited to 3 heroes! i wanna try them all) and access to sentinel and ranged cards or "give to another player" cards that are useless right now. Itll change the complextion of the game which is good every once in awhile.

***Update***

With the same deck I have now made it through CAC, JRT and HEM.  I did make it throught HFG but I had to make changes to my deck for CAC so I am going to go back for HFG.  I think there is so much luck that goes into CAC that "expert mode" is out of the question almost right away.

But off to Dead Marshes and RTM!  I'll keep you posted on how it goes, and if I can in fact get through all of Mirkwood using "expert mode" rules.

***Update***

Dead Marshes went without much of a fight.  The only issue was having to do an escape check with enough power left over to fight off a marsh adder.  RTM got me though.  Pretty exciting game; I even thought I was going to win.  One deck had a 48 and the other had 49 threat on the last turn.  Quested almost everyone, but pulled hill troll.  Got 15 will to 3 threat but didn't have enough power to beat the troll in the combat phase so the turn ended an I lost due to high threat. avergonzado_triste [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_scripts/ckeditor/plugins/smiley/images/avergonzado_triste.gif]

i havnt time now to post decklists but my general idea when approaching two handed is split each deck into the 2 obvious needs- questing/healing and fighting/defense with card draw and resource draw split between the two

one deck is usually single tactic with hama/legolas and other….beregond at the moment. i have thicket of spears so this with hamas recycle cant really keep enemies back. then the heros get through them easily enough

feint is in there for when i dont want to use all 3 resources.  usual weapons….rivendell an gondolin blades and bow for legolas. citadel spear  and plate for beragond. hama i usually leave as is.

the other deck changes but i was using my flight to the ford deck- frodo/glorfindel spriit/ strider lore

sometimes i switched frodo for elrond to give more ally options.

the deck is pretty much noldor with all the dwarrowdelf power cards in.

 

after that it really comes down to using ranged and sentinel effectively so that the questing deck need rarely be ready. once allies are out the killing power can get quite high

 

im currently working on two decks that are gondor and rohan to be able to use all the new cards along with the event with the banners on. it should be a nice theme deck

RTM has been defeated!  It seems like if you don't make it in 6 turns forget it.  I have to repeat HFG since I changed the decks radically to beat CAC.  I don't foresee any problems, but I will post a list after I make sure I can do HFG.

Hope any of this helps.  Also any ideas for improvements are welcome.  Also please keep me posted if you try to duplicate my results.  My games were (wins/total/score) HFG 1/1/119, CAC 1/12/165, JTR 1/2/150, HEM 1/2/184, DM 1/2/163, RTM 1/4/128.  Pretty good scores but my win rario is terrible in CAC.

The final verdict I think is that "expert mode" as defined in the rules is not possible.  I think it is just too unreasonable not to reset your threat after each chapter.  So I propose a "story mode" since it is not used yet.  Follow all expert mode rules except clear damage and reset your threat after each quest.  The catch is you cant change your heroes or deck from adventure to adventure.

I dont know if anyone will particularly care, but if enough people are interested I will give the same type of update to the Kazad-Dum and Dwarrowdelf cycles.  Also more stuff as it comes out.  I can also go back and redo the core set if anyone is clammoring for it.

## 25 [flightmaster101 on December 27, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/75760-playing-solo-2-handed/?do=findComment&comment=739599)

Dont know if anyone is still reading but I'll post this anyways.

I have finished Kazad Dum actually very easily.  Single handed it was always close and you could get overwhelmed very easily.  With a deck for questing and defense and another for fighting and healing I actually breezed through it two handed.  I will admit on "Flight From Moria"  I was extremely lucky and found the abandon tools on the initial staging and got "Escape from Darkness" as my third quest card, which enabled be to beat the quest in 5 turns.  The hardest quest was actually into the pit for me due to bad draws in the initial staging.  So my record for going through Kazad Dum (using only 1x Core + all 6 Mirkwood chapter packst + 1x KD expansion) is:

Quest (Win/Total Games/Score)

Into the Pit (1/3/153), The Seventh Level (1/1/151) and Flight From Moria (1/1/122).

For the Deck I wanted to make a Dwarf themed deck so I totally started over.  In hindsight the Rohan runner deck I have listed previously would have worked better because of Eowyn's willpower, but storywise you cant explore mines with horses so I changed it up.  So for my decks I have a Leadership/Spirit and a Tactics/Lore, the idea being Quest and defense in one and fighting and healing in the other.  The decklist is:

Deck 1:                                                                                                                 Deck 2:

Heroes:                                                                                                                 Heroes:

Dain Ironfoot/Dwalin/Gloin                                                                                    Bifur/Gimli/Thalin

Allies (Leadership then Spirit then Neutral):                                                          Allies (Tactis then Lore):

Snowbourn Scout x3                                                                                            Horseback Archer x2

The first thing that jumped out at me was how few dwarves there are up to this point.  So to get to 50 I did have to add some men and elves and of course never travel without the grey wizard.  It is not the best dwarf deck thematically, but oh well.  I have alwaysed used Eowyn as a crutch because of her high will and basically been good to quest with her, but Dain Ironfoot is fantastic to help others quest.  Also Dwalin kicks @$$, his threat reduction is so amazing I used him mainly to attack orcs.  I think these excersises in minimalism, using only what is released up to the point of the quest publication has helped me discover much about this game and how different cards work.  Playing two handed has also expanded the card pool and helped me see value in teamwork cards like "wandering Took" and "Gildor's Council".

I hope this helps anyone who plays solo and encourages them to play two handed.  I was afraid it would be to complex at first, but now I dont think I will go back to single deck playing.  It has also helped me beat "Return to Mirkwood" and "Escape From Dol Guldur" for the first time and made it a truly enjoyable experience.

I am still here & enjoying this. I went through the same journey at the beginning of the year although I started out with the two handed version. I have now tried single player & can't imagine going back ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] TBH I have a buddy to play 2 player with now & Octgn is tricky 2 handed …

Good to know!  I'll hopefully have an update on Dwarrodelf soon.  Right now I'm stuck on Road to Rivendell.  I keep questing with Arwen then getting a shadow card that says: " Discard exhausted allies."  And when Arwen leaves you loose, so that sucks.  Anyways thanks for the feedback and I'll try to post again soon.

Tip - don't quest with Arwen.  Early game or in emergencies you may have to but once you have some ally questing power she is better off at home along with as many heroes as possible.  I do not like the design of those two killer cards Sleeping Sentry & Orc Ambush but you can play around the first & the Ambush is very random (helpful if it pulls down a sniper).   I got huge satisfaction from beating this with my spiritless deck twice in a row now.

That is exactly what happened, early killer card.   In the first two turns I used her to quest for 2 reasons: 1. Will until I had Allies out and 2. Resource generation for Spirfindel.  So you can imagine my frustration shuffling three decks, prepping the play area only to lose in the combat phase of turn two.

I have only played this game solo 2-Handed, but I have found it to be a bit easier but tons more fun if you use slighty modified rules as follows:

Lord of the Rings, Living Card Game House Rules

Version 2.01 

 

 1. In the original game a player only gained resource tokens equal to the number of Heroes, one per Hero. This severely hinders playing with less than 3 Heroes and significantly penalizes a player who loses a Hero. Instead, make it so that each player ALWAYS gets 3 Resource Tokens each turn and they can allocate these 3 resource tokens to the Hero or Heroes of their choice. This way, playing with less than 3 Heroes, is more playable, AND players can now shift which spheres of Influence gain resources each turn, depending on what cards they hope to cast.
 2. Scoring Changes. Victory points were way too few, Change the scoring system as follows:
    * Victory points are gained at 2 times the number printed on a card. Victory points are also gained for killing enemies in combat and for exploring locations.
    * For enemy cards killed in combat: divide the Hit Points by 2 and round UP to get the victory points gained (in addition to the 2* victory points printed on the card as above).
    * For locations Explored: divide the Quest Points by 2 and round UP to get Victory points gained (in addition to 2* victory points printed on the card – this way those that are really important count more).
    * Also, instead of adding 10 times the number of rounds played, now add 5 times the total of the number of rounds played minus the Difficulty Level, i.e. 5*(# of rounds – difficulty level).

To facilitate this scoring system use decimal dice to record the number of rounds played, and another set of decimal dice to keep a record of victory points gained.

 1. Exhausted Heroes and Gandalf can try to attack engaged enemies, but if they succeed they do so with attack strength of 1 or 2. To attempt to attack, each exhausted Hero rolls 1D6 and they can attack if the roll is less than or equal to (2 + their Attack Strength). If (2 + Attack Strength) is less than 6, and they succeeded in the 1D6 roll, then they attack with an Attack Strength of 1. If (2+Attack Strength) is greater than or equal to 6 then they can automatically attack with an Attack Strength of 2. They can combine with other Heroes or allies of the same player. This way, besides defending and/or questing, exhausted Heroes (and Gandalf) have a chance to make some contribution to the attack phase too, depending on how good they are at combat.
 2. Do allow Heroes armor (shield) Defense Strength number to absorb damage from an undefended attack. However, every undefended attack will still result in at least 1 damage to the Hero. Also, an Undefended attack will only kill a Hero if they had only 1 hit point left, i.e. if the Hero had 2 or more hit points at the beginning of the undefended attack, then they will take at least 1 point of damage up to a maximum of (#Hit Points they have – 1). That way it takes at least 2 undefended attacks to kill a Hero. This makes Heroes a bit tougher and gives the players a chance to heal their Heroes before they get into critical condition.


 

 

Questions with answers

 1. Do encounter cards with victory points get shuffled back in the deck or held aside? YES, they do get shuffled back in after the victory points are recorded (in this version).
 2. Do engaged enemies stay engaged after refresh? YES
 3. Do cards attached to other cards exhaust independently? YES
 4. Does a player “control” enemy encounter cards attached to one of their characters? YES, see page 25 of rulebook.

Well it will certainly be a lot easier with those changes. I don't  track score so I don't care about that one, except it completely messes up some quests notably Hills of Emyn Muil. You need to double the VP needed for that one.

Really it's a solo game so you can play it however you want to. Making it really easy will be a bit pointless for steamrollering the scenarios with the strongest decks but will widen the pool of viable cards & decks so if that's what you want have at it! 

## 33 [flightmaster101 on January 9, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/75760-playing-solo-2-handed/?do=findComment&comment=745289)

I tired the house rules posted and I just think its too easy.

1) There is no stress on resouces, especially during Dol Guldur and Jouney down the Anduin.  In Anduin you have low enough threat to avoid the troll, get a forest snare, and a weak ally and sacrifice your ally, snare the troll and enough resources to "Gandalf" him in like 2 turns.

2) Using exhausted characters to attack makes the planning phase almost irrelivant.  I can defend with Gandalf use his 4 def + 4 hp and turn around and attack with him also.  The dice method means Gandalf will always get an attack and Aragorn or Gimli or any hero really with attachments can be guarenteed an attack also, with a greater attack than heroes who have a chance at failure.

Since I didnt play a vp specific game I have no comment about the vp rules.

It just seems to me these rules have eliminated much of the "cost" of questing and defending, and therefore you will dominate every game with very rudamentary planning.  There is also a puzzle factor to this game thay goes arwy when you eliminate these things.  For instance for Journey with only the core set your best friend is "forest snare", but with the ability to go in with the low threat of one hero and literally buy your way out of trouble makes the scenario moot.

I dont like games that I just dominate by showing up, I like the failures of Dwarrowdelf (for instance) they make success feel all the better.  And knowing how easy it is to fail makes the excitement of putting that last progress tokien on the last quest card very rewarding.

I usuallly always play 2P and have never tried single played 2-handed.  I can completely understand why some people would do this, especially if you have no-one else to play with and you want to make use of all the cards you payed for, but does it not make the game too easy?  The rules state that players 'cannot name or read out loud directly from cards in their hand, or from cards that they have seen but the rest of the players have not', presumably so that it's not too easy to set up combos etc.  Obviously this element is removed in a 2-handed game.

No disresepect to people who play like this - like I said, I understand why you would want to - but do you not feel like you're *whispers* cheating the game a little bit?

## 35 [bollywongaloid on January 10, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/75760-playing-solo-2-handed/?do=findComment&comment=745624)

Further to my last post also, it seems that a lot of people who play '2-handed' are under the belief that the game is easier in 2 player.  Over the last 18 months or so of playing, I have simply found this not to be true.  I play almost exclusively 2P, but when I do play solo I almost always find things a lot easier and my win rate goes up.  I dunno… maybe my partner is just a bit rubbish sonreir [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_scripts/ckeditor/plugins/smiley/images/sonreir.gif]

## 36 [Pickles on January 10, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/75760-playing-solo-2-handed/?do=findComment&comment=745655)

2 player is easier with a lot of scenarios such as those in the core set & return to Mirkwood. I expect it is not easier in eg Into Ithilien where you burn through the deck faster  & have much more chance of hitting a Warg Apocalypse.

Another thing I suspect is that 2 player will work with slightly less good decks a reasonable part of the time so it's a chance to try out weaker stuff & still win sometimes.  & one more thing is probably 2 decks not synergising as well as one deck does.

Playing solo also eliminates some good mechanics (like FOS) and makes a few scenarios unwinnable, which is why i started going to a 2 deck game.

I played pure solo for a long time before moving to 2-handed play, and I haven't looked back since. To me, it's not about making the game easier, it's just a lot more fun to actually be able to use "ranged" and "sentinel" and to build two decks that work together. As far as whether or not this is "cheating", I guess that is in the eye of the beholder. Personally, I always thought the "table talk" rule was pointless and misguided. The game is supposed to be cooperative, and players should be able to freely discuss whatever they want with each other. I don't think the "table talk" rule adds anything to the game, and it doesn't fundamentally make the game easier to ignore it.

Hmmm i play mostly solo and i win against every scenarios which is here for current day.

2 player game si more fun bu much most of scenarios is too easy for 2 player game special if they are good players and both have good synergy decks.

But HON change it! So now 2 or more player game is much more interesting and hard then before.

Yes sure. With Elrond/Hama/Glorifindel(spirit) deck. There is a eagles as well, feint ( to stop the Balrog) and Vilya mechanic. Actually this deck can beat any quests Up to SAF date.

I have another deck which one can beat any quest Up to date now! If you go to Strategy and deck buliding part of this forum you will see topic Thorin complany dwarves deck. Check it out! IS most powerfull solo deck in my opinion now. Can win all quests and HON as well.

There's just too many mechanics that only profit from 'dual-wielding' two decks, so I'd rather play 2.

***Update***

I dont know how many have been waiting around, but I made it 5/6th of the way through Dwarrowdelf and continue to get creamed on Shadow and Flame.  I did some analysis on my decks and realized that I have only 18 characters in my Lead/Tactics deck.  So I took out a few attachments and added some low cost characters as sacraficial lambs to Durin's Bane.  Unfortunatly this means I will have to play all 6 again to make sure these decks work for the entire cycle.  I also will change from a core x1 to a core x3 since Amazon had that sale, and I may as well use all my cards.  This will give me feint x3, I think that will be benificial over the whole cycle.

So true bro too many mechanics in palyer and enqounter cards go off in 1 deck play ,its like u r playing the game in a wrong way ! all the way !!!

## 47 [flightmaster101 on February 1, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/75760-playing-solo-2-handed/?do=findComment&comment=757146)

*** Update ***

 

I have changed my deck significantly to pass SAF.  Mainly taking our events and attachments and adding 1 and 2 cost allies to be sacraficial lambs to Durin's Bane.  I will be playing through the rest of the cycle to see if these decks can make it through the entire cycle and are not just specialized to SAF.

 

The basics of what I am using is a Spirit/Lore and Lead/Tactics with Aragorn, Elrond, Spirfindel and Elrohir, Elledan, and Legolas.  The idea is to make "Elf" decks, and I think it works with the theme of Dwarrodelf since you are first going from Lorien to Rivendell then Elrond asks you to go to Moria.  The second reason is because there are a lot of killer Dwarf decks out there and I havent seen a relly good Elf Deck yet, so why not make one myself.

For the spriit/lore deck the MOST improtant thing is getting "Light of Valinor" (FOS) on Glorfindel so he can quest "for free".  2nd is getting Vilya out on Elrond and the other is having the L/T deck get Celeborn's Stone out for Aragorn.  Vilya and Celeborn's stone are not as important as getting the Light on Glorfindel.

For the L/T deck I dont really have a "must have" starting hand except maybe getting Rivendell Blade on Legolas might be nice, and getting "Stewart of Gondor" or "Resourceful" on Elrohir would be nice, but not necessary.  This deck is made to get "support of the eagles" on Legolas (for attack) or Elrohir (for defense) and use "Eagles of the Misty Mountains" stacked with "Vassal of the Windlord" and "Winged Guardian" to make them have super attack or defense.

## 48 [flightmaster101 on February 20, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/75760-playing-solo-2-handed/?do=findComment&comment=765346)

***Update***

So this deck was a little worse for entire cycle, but better for SAF.  I initially had some trouble out of the gate with Redhorn Gate, I almost changed my deck again becuase I thought it was going to be impossible.  The basic strategy behind my deck is the entry above.  Basically get the Light of Valinor on Glorfindel and get 2 copies of Feint in the other hand for Hama to disable enemies with.

The biggest reason I had to change decks was becasue my Lead/Tac deck was 50% events 30% char and 20% att.  And while it worked well on 5 of the 6 chapters it failed miserably in SAF.  First Legolas went bye bye and Hama was added for his ability to get Feint back into my hand.  So that deck changed to include more low cost characters and slim down the events and attachments, I even reduced so many card I put some resource generation in.  My Spirit/Lore deck suffered because going strictly on theme gave me too many high cost allies, which again worked well for 5 of the 6 chapters but when you cant get a low cost ally out to sacrafice to Durin's Bane it really hurts saying goodbye to a hero.

So once again my "theme" of Elves got spit up and I ended up with some men and dwarves in to help the elves out.  I'm just disspointed mainly because there are so many great "dwarf decks" out there that really stick to a dwarves only theme.  So for both Mirkwood and Dwarrowdelf I had to blow up my theme to get something that worked for the entire cycle.

So my scores went (score, wins/losses): TRG 198 1/4, RTR 119 1/2, TWITW 116 1/1, TLD 134 1/2, FOS 202 1/2, SAF 169 1/1.

Sorry for the delay for all those who like to check up on this.  This is a tough cycle, and I have only had time to play about 3x a week lately and when you fail as much as I was it takes a while to get stuff done.  Let me know if people out there are still interested, I should be moving on to my HoN box next and I am still thinking of a theme for that deck.  I am thinking a Gondor/Rohan mix, but let me know what has worked out there for you guys.

Also for the community: am I too strict with my theme?  When you guys theme a deck for say "Gondor" do you include dwarves, elves and rohan types to help?
