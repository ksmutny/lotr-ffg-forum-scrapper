I bought Ruins of Belegost off someone on ebay back when it originally came out as a gencon quest....

I only ever played it a handful of times till I beat it and haven't again... I should really go back to it in the near future as it is an absolutely amazing quest albeit quite **** difficult.

Could not more highly recommend you guys buying a copy if you don't already have it!!!!

Now that everyone will soon have it and will have various decks and strategies to beat it I should do like a little review or write up for those who don't want to go into it blind. Would anyone be interested in reading something like this where I talk about how I beat it, certain encounter cards of effects to look out for etc? I'm no Glaurung or Seastan but it might help someone in the end? *shrug*

 

Murder at prancing pony I do not have.... honestly though not sure if I will buy this even though I have every other product released to date (except the most recent nightmare sets and grey havens which are not out in Australia yet) to date as I definitely think it is the least thematic quest to date and is more of a sherlock homes who did it scenario within Middle Earth..

Going to wait and see what peoples responses are when more people get their hands on it and what purists/fans of lore and theme have to say about this quest... 

Either way I am extremely happy we finally have these POD quests and am excited to hear others tales of their experiences with Ruins of Belegost

PsychoRocka,

 

As I am not a particularly good deck builder (or player), I'd love to hear some strategies and ideas about beating Belegost.  It looks really cool!  

 

As for Murder...I very much enjoy the lore and theme of the Tolkien world, but am far from a purist.  I would say that it isn't particularly lore un-friendly (it doesn't introduce steam powered dino-bots or anything and certainly the potential for crime exists within ME), but probably doesn't adhere particularly closely to the themes that seem to be emphasized in the the source material.  That said, it is a really fun quest.

Played Murder at the Prancing Pony at the Fellowship Event. It's a very enjoyable quest with good replay value. It's no less thematic a quest than Ruins of Belegost, which I've also played (and also enjoyed quite a bit). Both quests are worth purchasing by any serious LOTR:LCG fan imho.

Yeah, the theme on that one is more about living in Middle-Earth than it is about living in the War of the Ring.

I've won Murder at the Prancing Pony at the Beorn contest (thanks again, Beorn :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]), and had it for some time now. It's a heck fun of the quest, and pretty challenging (for me) too. The replay value is tremendous. Just a little tip: avoid bringing Grima on this one. It's rarely ends well :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Belegost seems like a must for a first age, dwarven fan who is in need of a Silmarillion card game (even through it won´t be coming).

Aw man Dinobots might've actually sold me on it!! :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

Jokes aside though you guys are right in that it is not overly unthematic but at the same time there is just something about the quest, even just the look of certain encounter cards (mainly that johnny goblin fingers guy...), that just don't seem right :unsure: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_unsure.png]

I'm sure I will eventually get it in the end and probably even love it ha

I guess your consciousness just refuses to acknowledge that a hobbit may be malign :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Murder at the Prancing Pony is such an awesome scenario. I got it at the Fellowship event last year, and continue to play it regularly. My whole playgroup loves it.

Have you seen the unofficial First Age expansion that someone made awhile back?

 

 

And I second everyone's opinion that Murder is a great quest. To me, it makes the world seem more real, since there would definitely be crimes and murder and the mechanics of this scenario do a good job of portraying going around investigating things.

I enjoyed Murder a lot more than Ruins. Man, Ruins of Belegost is insanely hard, despite whatever Matt said about it being more about fun than challenge. Not a huge fan, although thematically it is a total win.

Murder at the Prancing Pony is great quest with high repleability, but some times game lasts to long. Investigation mechanics is interesting feature in game.

I made video (in slovak lang.) from my solo play with Frodo Baggins, Glorfindel (spirit) and Aragorn (lore).

I´ve seen it, and like it a lot. It is so many good ideas there, but it´s not the same as official ones. That doesn´t stop me from loving that first age expansion (an the cycle).

I love the table ^^

Do these come with the Alternate Hero Cards that were available at Gen Con as well? Either way, pretty excited to check these out!

## 22 [Rob_Oz on February 23, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/203008-new-adventures-in-middle-earth/?do=findComment&comment=2067157)

Unless FFG has made a change these will only contain the scenario and quest cards. No alternate art hero cards. So far, FFG has only offered the alternate hero art hero cards to event attendees.

So my FLGS finally got these and I spent the wekend investigating a murder in Bree.  Surprisingly tough and has excellent replayability.  That said I don't know that they could keep going back to the same well again and again if they developed a sort of Sherlock Holmes LCG.  There are other things gthey could do too of course.

 

On to Belegost!
