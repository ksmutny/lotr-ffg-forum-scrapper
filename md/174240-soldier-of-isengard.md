Hello!

Please tell me if I am right:

1)If Soldier of Isengard attacks and destroys a character and I have an active location the progress token is placed on it,not on the quest.

2)If Wild Hillman [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/lord-of-the-rings-saga-expansions/the-treason-of-saruman/wild-hillman-r1396] or Warrior of Dunland [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/lord-of-the-rings-saga-expansions/the-treason-of-saruman/warrior-of-dunland-r1397] triggers their forced effect while there is no active location I shouldn't place any progress tokens.

Thank you!

#2 is surely right.  #1, about the Soldier of Isengard: the obvious parallel is Legolas or Gondolin Blade.  These guys have to place progress tokens on the active location first, even though they say the progress is placed on the quest.  Based on that, I guess that the Soldier follows the same rule.  But this is a new mechanic-- the encounter deck does not usually try to place progress tokens, so there is not a lot of precedent.  I don't own this expansion yet, so I don't have the rules insert.  I would check that and see if this is explicitly discussed, and if not, I guess the progress tokens should go on the active location first.

The last paragraph in the explanation of defense basically says that unless a card says that it bypasses any current active location, the active location still acts as a buffer, just like it would for Legolas/Blade of Gondolin. Any progress made by the encounter deck or an encounter card effect (like Soldier of Isengard's) would be placed on the active location first.
