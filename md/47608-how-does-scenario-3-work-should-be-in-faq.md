# [How does scenario 3 work?  (Should be in FAQ)](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47608-how-does-scenario-3-work-should-be-in-faq/)

So what do the attached cards on the objectives do?  No cards reference them, the rules don' say anything, and the quest card doesn't say anything.  As far as I can tell they're stuck on there forever and you can't actually beat 1A.

Are you serious? Read the rulebook again.

I agree that something is unclear to me:

What does it mean when he says players as a group can play only one ally per round?He mean every player's group of heroes?

When you hold the torch, yuo have to raise your threat of 2 or 1+2 at the end of the round?

Guarded means you stick one card from the encounter deck to the objective, and until it is in the staging area (or defeated) you can't claim it.Can you claim it in every phase or subphase as an action? Can you engage the guarding enemy as normal?

Do you deal shadow cards to the orcs of the last stage (1/1 with one HP)?

If I attach forest snare to the Nazgul, What happen with his shadow card?It doesn't attack, so the shadow card isn't revealed, right?

I'd like to know kind of the same hings, but a few answers are there I can give.

 

- You can't trap the Nazgul (-> FAQ)

- Torch: I'd say (based on the wording of the german version of the game): 1+1, the total amount you have to raise your threat is now 2 instead of the normal 1

- All players are the group, so if you're playing a 4player-game you still can just bring one ally in each round.

 

As for the other questions, I'd like to know some answers to those too. It seems strange that an orc guarding an objective yould just attack you ans thus leaving it's post. Or the strange orc-guard cards: Yes, do they get a shedow card? I dealt them one as I treated them like normal enemys, but: what happens to the card from my deck that represents the orc? Don't look at it and put it back on top (that's how I played it because I assumed the card is just an reminder for the orc)

All this is IMO, but it seems mostly to be common sense:

 

1) The players, as a group -> Only one ally per round. can be played (overall).

2) Torch -> Raise your threat by 1+2. Nowhere does it imply that it replaces the normal. Therefore it is a separate effect.

3) Guarded -> Why wouldn't you be able to engage a guarding enemy? It says it takes an action to claim it. So you can claim it any time you can take an action.

4) Shadow Cards -> Why wouldn't you deal it one? It is an enemy engaged with a player.

5) Nazgul -> This was covered in the FAQ.

 

Hope that helped.

Again IMO,

It's a card that was in play that came from your deck. When it leaves play it should be discarded.

1. Only one ally can be played, TOTAL, per turn by all players combined.

2. The torch says to increase by 2, and it is an entirely separate effect from the normal increase at turn end, so that would be 3 total.

3. The attatched cards are treated as they normally would be. Enemies engage, attack and can be attacked, locations can be traveled to and explored, treachery cards affect play as usual. When an objective is free from cards it can be claimed as stated on the card itself (presently, all available objectives are claimed as actions).

4. The orc guards are "treated as enemies" and so get shadow cards like any other enemy.

5. As mentioned, the Nazgûl can´t be trapped, but any other enemy which can is still dealt a shadow card, but is never resolved since the enemy never attacks. As mentioned on p.20 in the rules, all shadow cards are then discarded at the end of combat.

Ok you confirmed what i did till now.

I discarded my orc cards and gave them shadow cards!

But I still have a doubt:what happened after i discard an objective I control?It goes in the encounter discard pile?

Just a side question on Guarded. When is the objective considered free for claiming? When you engage the enemy or travel to the location, thus removing it from staging, or when you defeat the enemy/explore the location?

## 11 [Titan on May 31, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47608-how-does-scenario-3-work-should-be-in-faq/?do=findComment&comment=477868)

I believe an objective should be considered free once there is no card attached to it, i. e. the enemy is dead/the location is explored.

All of them say at the bottom: If detached, return to the staging area.

Well, once the card leaves the staging area, it's no longer "attached" to the objective. I think what you're implying is no longer "associated" with the objective. That's where my confusion came from. Are they referring to physical attachment, or mental association?

Here's the section on guarded from the rule book...

"Guarded
The guarded keyword is a reminder on some objective
cards to reveal and attach the next card of the encounter
deck to the objective when it enters the staging area
from the encounter deck, and place them both in the
staging area. The objective cannot be claimed as long
as any encounter card is attached.Once that encounter
is dealt with, the objective remains in the staging area
until it is claimed.

........

An encounter card attached to a guarded objective is dealt with in the
following method, depending on its card type:


Enemy: The enemy leaves play, either by being
defeated or as the result of a card effect.


Location: The location leaves play, either by being
fully explored or as the result of a card effect.


Treachery: The treachery’s effects resolve, or are
canceled. (Treachery cards are immediately triggered
when they are revealed.)


Once all encounter cards attached to a guarded
objective are dealt with, the players can claim the
objective in the manner specified by its card text."

The emphasis is mine, but nowhere does it say the objective stays in the staging area all the time. You could move the objective card with the encounter card to which it is attached (to the active location area or a players engagement zone as appropriate) and once that encounter is dealt with, place the objective  in the staging area where it remains until claimed.

Thats how I do it to avoid losing the association between objective and encounter card guarding it.

But when new encounter cards come out in the Quest phase, they get attached to the unclaimed Objective, right? Or did I misinterpret that.

Nope, don't think so. The objective card stays in the staging area but unclaimed, until you claim it but it doesn't get covered with another encounter card in the next questing phase - the risk eith leaving it there is that the dungeon jailer comes along and nicks it though.
