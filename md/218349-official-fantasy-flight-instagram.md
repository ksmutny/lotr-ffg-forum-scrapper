Spoiled art for an unnamed card.

I bet it will be a quest or campaign card

Hopefully the announcement is coming soon… was I saying that about two months ago? Maybe...

Looks like the siege of Minas Tirith.

Might be the box cover for the next saga.

We already have HoN, so is this for saga expansion?

Probably. I'm guessing it's the box art.

If they finish the sage boxes by giving us a Spirit Aragorn hero, my life will be complete.

Your life will still be incomplete...you will have to await Neutral Aragorn and, dare I say it, Baggins Aragorn inconspicuously disguised as a Hobbit.

Doubt it. All saga cover art so far has been done by Chris Rahn, and this one isn't.

It's definitely the Siege of Minas Tirith, so this has gotta be from the 5th Saga box. I'm thinking Quest card, from the aspect ratio. It's too long to be an encounter card.

Boom.
