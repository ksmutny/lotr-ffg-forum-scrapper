my store says rehorn 15th jan, however i find that hard to believe seeing as it will probably get khazad hopefully within a week or so making that around 6th...

Is that maelstrom? I must admit, I wasn't really expecting the Dwarrowdelf Cycle to kick off until around March/April, seeing as how pretty much everything so far has been delayed to some extent. I hope not though!

Redhorn Gate is not even on the boat yet.  Once we get confirmation that it is on the boat, we have to wait 5 to 8 weeks before we can see it in stores.

So, even if we hear on Tuesday that it is on the boat, we will have to wait until February 7 to 28 to get it in stores.  But it might not even get on the boat for another week or two, so we might not see it until March.  :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

Bryon,

Don't give up. The status information that you refer to, has been unreliable in the past. If I remember correctly, some expansions from Mirkwood cycle had worldwide release without having any status updates.

 words of wisdom, indeed. ffg, take your time... after all, there HAS to be a quality jump now, as we are approaching the second cycle... though I LOVED the last quest... it's soooo hard :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

i would hope the rules/quests are more problem /errata free, but they shouldnt all be RTM level hard...otherwise solo players will have wasted their money (unless of course FFG finally get the scaling issues sorted out) i would be happy with a level 3/ level 6/ level 7-8, then everyones happy

Honestly in my group frustration is already spreading. Unless you play with 3+ players and prepare decks especially for each scenario your odds are long. Soloplay is getting more and more for masochists anyway (needing 10+ tries before they make it with perfect play and luck on the draw).

I agree with Vyron on the quest difficulty. We got three DL7 and zero DL2 or DL 3 so far.

Legolas, please don't take any offence, but you are probably not experienced with this game yet. With good deckbuilding skills and with good play, you should be able to win solo most of the scenarios easily. And you will not need a perfect draw from your deck and/or encounter deck. Just play more and study the game. Of course, some scenarios will be still very hard, for example Dol Guldur or Return To Mirkwood are rated as very hard for solo players. But quests like Anduin, Carrock, Hunt, Marshes, Emyn Muil are beatable easily with one, same deck.

Bottom line: FFG needs to create both easy and hard quests. Right now they are doing good job judging from my solo experience. There are 5 easy quests and 4 hard quests. And the best one by far is Return To Mirkwood. I just love it solo.

agreed...just made similar point in another post, the scaling is fine, all but RTM, which is the only pack that is rather too hard for solo..but still do able, just.

RtM is easier than Dol Guldur solo. At least based on my ~25 plays against each quest.
