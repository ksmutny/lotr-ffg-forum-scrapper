My friendly local game store said they'd have it in stock Thursday or Friday.

Says pre-order only to me. Maybe FFG is planning on making their formal announcement later today then making it avaliable for purchase afterwards

Ah, that would explain it. ATM, it's currently being sold by a 3rd party seller, Funagain Games. Interesting that Amazon even stocked the item so early. From my experience, when it came to LCG, Amazon was the worst. They would be 2 weeks or even a month late. Perhaps Amazon finally got their act together, or maybe I've been really slow this whole time lol? Now all they need to do is stock a little bit more.

Thats because its sold by funagaingames and fullfiled by amazon.  That is also the reason it is not elligible for prime.  Either buy it local or wait until it says "sold by amazon, fulfilled by amazon"  cause these hobby shops that go through amazon are a bunch of greedy *u*ks dont ever encourage them buy purchasing their crap deals.  And email amazon also, let them know that these bastards are using the marketplace to gouge people so amazon wil start selling it directly.

The final preview is out http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=3960 [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=3960]

 

Am I the only one that is disappointed by the fact that the new Bifur ally is lore and is dependent on the controlling 5 dwarfs. I thought he was going to be a leadership dwarf when I first saw the decks.

Also the treasures are pretty cool.

i think it's safe to assume, especially now, that the dwarf allies of bifur, dwalin, and gloin will retain the same sphere of influence as their hero counterparts. It is a little disappointing to see tactics get shunned again dwarf wise

(spoilers below)

 

I just opened up my copy and can say there is one reprinted card, at least the name, "Smaug The Magnificient."  I haven't checked yet to ensure if it's the same in stats, effects, etc.

Some pretty interesting cards, overall.  Ravens of the Mountain is a Lore Event that caught my eye.  Many of the player cards were previewed.  Oin is a Spirit hero.  I'm looking forward to trying out the quests.

He's another one for Dwarf decks (the 5 of clause) and teams with Tactics.  Not bad.  8 starting threat.

Ok, here's a few: (spoilers)

Ravens of the Mountain, Lore, Event, Cost 1

Action: Exhaust a hero you control to shuffle the encounter deck and reveal its top card.  Place progress tokens on the current quest equatl to the revealed card's TP.  Then, put that card back on top of the encounter deck.

Oin, Spirit Hero, Dwarf, 8 Starting Threat, 2 WP, 1 A, 1 D, 4 HP,

While you control at least 5 Dwarf characters, Oin gets +1 A and gains the Tactics resource icon.

Straight Shot, Tactics, Event, Cost 0

Action: Exhaust a Weapon attachment to choose a non-unique enemy with 0 D.  Discard the chosen enemy.

Expert Treasure-Hunter, Lore Attachment, Skill, Cost 0

Attach to a hero.

Response: After attached hero quests successfully, name a card type and discard the top card of your deck.  If the discarded card is the named type, take it into your hand.

There is a complete card by card write up at the BGG site:  http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/934486/live-text-unboxing [http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/934486/live-text-unboxing]

It seems the OP made a mistake on the Oin Hero, he wrote:

Oin (Spirit, 8 cost)
2/1/1/4
Dwarf.
While you control at least 5 Dwarf characters, Oin gets +1(ATK) and gains the (LEADERSHIP) resource icon

On page 4 of the thread another poster states that Oin gets the Tactics Icon instead of  leadership.

Ooh, ravens of the mountain is a pretty cool card. Like a Denethor or Hennamarth action that adds progress. Not a staple but a cool card that could see some use.

Go figure just as I knock FFG for the lack of tactics dwarves they give Oin a very cool and unique ability that satisfies this need. This is the first hero that can naturally be dual sphere as well. Will be interesting to see if this ability will make him the dwarf spirit of choice over Nori who could technically meet the same specs with a song of battle.

Which is sort of funny statement seeing as how there are some REALLY good Tactics Dwarf cards. But I totally get what you're saying, it's a little odd we haven't gotten a Tactics Dwarf hero since the core set.

How cool would it be to play a four person game with each player playing a mono-sphere all-dwarf deck? This was the perfect opportunity to make that a possibility. It'll probably be awhile now until we see another card with the word "dwarf" written anywhere on it. :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

good article over on bbg, i think its kind of cool if not unorginial that dwalin, gloin, and bifur all have single use effects dependent on having 5 dwarfs…makes the Bombur hero that much more important too since it'd be somewhat of a waste to play them if you didnt already enough dwarves in play.

kinda wish dwalin being spirit and all would have lowered the players threat when he entered instead of having a lower cost but no big deal; still cool and his 2 DEF would be quite helpful

Attachment:

Thror's Key (Unique, Spirit, 1 cost)
Artifact. Item.

Attach to a hero.

Response: After a location is added to the staging area, attach Thror's Key to that location. While attached to a location, Thror's Key gains: "Treat attached location's printed text box as blank, except for traits."

I love what this will do to Caradhras.  Some people over at BGG were saying this would make it easy to collect the Doors of Durin too (Water in the Water), but attaching this to the Doors would not do anything, right?  You would have to move the Doors into the staging area (Thror's Map, West Road Traveler) to attach it, and then all it would do is remove the ability to collect them at all.

So now that we have just a boatload of dwarf heroes, who does everyone anticipate they'll be making their decks with? I play a lot of solo and can see good potential with a Thorin, Oin, and Bombur. Gives you access to every sphere and the potential to quickly activate the powers of Thorin and Oin. (Trying to exclude Dain for thematic and originality purposes). 

If I was making two player decks i can see the use of Thorin, Balin, and Ori for deck 1 and Thalin, Oin, and Nori for deck two

Including Dain in the mix probably improves the strength of the decks at the cost of theme since Thorin would probably be the odd leadership hero out but arguably the most important if one is trying to recreate the adventures from the book.

What do you guys think?

## 26 [jc1138 on February 25, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/79582-on-the-doorstep-is-available/?do=findComment&comment=766927)

Yeah, that's the real trick, with Dain being kinda the elephant in the room (imo) when talking about dwarf decks.  Is he necessary?  No.  Does he make your dwarves much better?  Yes.  I like Thorin alright, but it's not as if Leadership didn't have other access to resources, and when you need them most is BEFORE getting to that 5 dwarf threshold, although having additional resources can be good any time.

All very true; but that's also why my Thorin, Oin, Bombur deck idea is growing on me.  Pull one of the three erebor record keepers that should be in your deck turn 1 and you start getting the xtra resource turn 2. That's huge. Throw in a Navri's belt that you could play turn 2 and paying for things of any color will be a breeze regardless of if you pull steward of gondor. Plus even tho Bombur lacks the card draw perks of Ori as a lore hero, you can easily make up for it with legacy of durin and the new king under the mountain card

made the deck last night after my box came in; works pretty great but i needed some extra questing power in the second quest to get past smaug so i substituted Dain in for Thorin.  Its also pretty satisfying make Bombur a defensive wall.  Throwing in some cheap dunedain signals and giving him a burning brand turn him into an absolute wall.  His high hp is really nice too especially for the flies and spiders quest because he can soak up a lot of poison before going "unconscious".  Another nice little combo i've found with the deck is using Stargazer (despite her lack of theme…or hey maybe she can help them read the moon writing on the map!) with king under the mountain to consistantly draw a good card and discard an unnecessary (or superflous) one.  Having Oin in the deck i was able to run Will of the West too incase i ran through my deck too quickly (whcih i did especially on the first scenario that makes you discard a lot of cards from your deck a la foundations of stone and the nameless things)

i'm planning on posting a new topic later with my observations on all the players cards and quests later today

I might try out a deck along those lines myself. I like how you can get all four spheres represented in a single Dwarf deck. 

However, I can't try any solo runs through On the Doorstep until my wife and beat them all together. :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

We're trying to play at least mostly thematic and utilize all 13 dwarves. Her deck is Bombur, Ori, & Nori while mine is Thorin, Balin, and Oin.

So far the only time we've beaten Flies and Spiders, it was via accidentally cheating (we didn't discard all of the Baggins resources on beginning Stage three).

I'd like to make the decks stronger, but I'm not sure how without sacrificing some theme. (Thorin or Balin might need to bow-out in favor of Dain.)

I've only played Flies and Spiders and it's pretty tough. The bulk of the encounter cards are Spiders with effects that are likely to start doing poison to your characters. Poison occurs when you take damage from an attack. When a character has poison equal to their printed Hit Points then they are unconscious  (unable to collect resources or basically do anything). It wouldn't be so bad, but there's a bunch that will poison you even if they don't make successful attacks and then there start being bonuses and automatic damage against poisoned character. The real kicker though, is when the party gets separated (kinda like the Foundations of Stone quest). The first player has to quest and deal with spiders with only Bilbo, until they're slowly able to get some of their characters back. The other players can't move on from where they are until the first player rejoins them and get an extra spider every turn (two extra spiders if there are four players. This is pretty tough in two player.

While the quest is challenging, I'm sure that I could tailor decks that could handle it pretty well. Using ways to kill the spiders in the staging area for instance would make it a lot easier.

I sow the first quests of the Box i think Thorin Company migh have a problem with this one.

Will see will see. Still Only when Dain get errata i will be happy. this deck is unfair.

There is was i not so bad idea about Dain errata: Something like: Planing action: Exhaust Dain to make All dwarfs character +1 attack or +1 will power until the end of the round. Choose one and limit once per round.

Glaurung: your Thorin deck will own these quests.  My deck (Thorin, Ori &Nori) does ok, but doesn't get the questing power boost from Dain on all the allies in play.  You won't have any trouble.

I sow the first quests of the Box i think Thorin Company migh have a problem with this one.

ive agreed previously that the deck is really good and I've had lots of fun playing with iterations of it myself, but I just can't understand the insistence that it needs to be merged. You claim it is unfair…unfair to who? Who are the victims? The encounter deck? It's an object I don't think it minds, the game makers? They already got your money they prob don't care if its unfair. to the players? We chose to use the deck knowing it is likely you'll be able to beat most scenarios, no one is forcing anyone.

they only way that I see Dain as a potential problem for the game is in the new competitive format (which isn't even released yet) hopefully in the near future other traits will gain power like the dwarves (who are u likely to see any specific cards anytime soon) so that there are multiple competitive deck styles to make.  It would be a shame if it is errata'd then a few months down the line after the AtS cycle is complete Gondor is now the new super power and no one cares to use dwarf decks becuse they've been nerfed to the point of being obsolete (like most errata'd cards)

whew, that's my two cents anyway

There is a couple ^unfair things^

First is unfair for the game balance. In my opinion is not right when some combinaion of cards is too powerful in the game. Is meat bad job of designers.

Is unfair for tournaments system

And is unfair to Tolkien world. I like to fear the encounter cards not laugh about them. I can win in 5 rounds again Balrog. I dont scare him and feel boring.

In Middle-earh ccg or Lotr Tcg all Mordor cards was scary. You really have a problem and scre them. Is good fit Tolkien them. here is just a matter who make it more quicly. Is only 1 powerful enemy in the gmae now is Smaug.

I hope that FFG do care about our opinions regarding the over powerful dwarf deck. I fully expect them to learn from that and not to make Gondor (or any other trait) too powerful. Im sure in hindsight they could have adjusted Dains special ability to boost HEROES ONLY.
