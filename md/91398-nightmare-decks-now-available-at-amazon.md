i've just noticed that amazon have finally started selling the first batch of nightmare decks, if anyone hasn't got them yet (uk). i've been waiting ages for these -- they've been out for ages!

 

still waiting for them to get the new black riders box though... i wonder why it's taking them so long

I just ordered Black Riders from Amazon on Friday as they say it is now in stock. You can also get Nightmare packs from OG Games in UK. Can't wait for BR to arrive :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
