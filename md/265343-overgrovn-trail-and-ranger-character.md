Hi.

If I commit ranger character to the quest may I place 3 progress tokens on Overgrown Trail?

No. It's an action to exhaust a Ranger to place the progress, not a response to a Ranger being exhausted for a separate reason.

In another word overgrown trail use a "cost" TO "effect", so you must pay the cost to have the effect. So you must exhaust in order to perform the action. Not for anything else.
