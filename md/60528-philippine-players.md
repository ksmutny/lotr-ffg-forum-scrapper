I have been playing solo adventures since getting the core set last year. I currently have all the expansions, but I have yet to meet a local play group here in Metro Manila. Anyone from the Philippines out there interested to get together to play a 3 to 4 player game? happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif] 

I have to admit that response to this thread will determine if I should continue collecting this LCG or not. I have grown to love this game, but I swear Eowyn has been bitching at me recently as to why she keeps on getting sent on every freaking adventure. I need some variety people!!!

first there is a player meet up thread on here, it should be no more than a page back

 

also stick with it solo, with your card pool, you shouldnt need eowyn, there are many questing options opened up since core, map maker is one, and also protector of lorien with bilbo and other card draw techniques

Hey Red Viper,

 

You seem to be a AGOT player as well. Cool!  Me and my wife live in Taiwan currently, but if you want to do some playing in Phils we go there at least once or even twice a year. I know that isn't enough, but its a start

Hi  Bonus Card,

I used to be an AGOT player from the CCG days, but for the mean time I'm into Arkham Horror, LOTR and other boardgames. Send me a message when you come over to Manila. happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]

I was there for Xmas, brought my LoTR with me (but didn't get to play).  I usually come home on December.  I live in Las Vegas but will relocate there in Manila, if not this year then maybe next year.  I use to have Arkham Horror but sold it . I like board games too.
