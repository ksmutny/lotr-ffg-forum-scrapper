Hi guys!

Â 

That question popped up as I was playing RtM:

Can I convert damage from an undefendet attack into threat with Frodo's ability when I'm currently guarding Gollum?

I played it that way, but after re-reading Gollums text I think I was wrong.

You have to take the undefended damage to Gollum, so you would sadly not be able to use Frodo's ability.

Thanks. Then I got it right in the end... but I have to replay those RtM games...
