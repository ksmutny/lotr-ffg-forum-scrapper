I'd like to know from people if their copy of the dungland crap has arrived?

Here in Holland there still is not a single shop I'm aware of that has it in stock.

The rumor is that there is a customs problem, but that's quessing at best.

So i'd like to hear from people in Denmark, Belgium, Germany, Norway, Sweden, etc.

Or anywhere else except the US & Canada really, If there are any problems with shipping as well?

As the APs usually arrive some 2 weeks after it's release date here; and that's long overdue.

Could someone shed some light on this? As I want ma Dungland crap!

Sweden here - I got mine from Gamesquest, via Ebay.co.uk. They seem to ship worldwide. It really was the only seller I could find that shipped to Scandinavia. The Book Depository also ships worldwide, but I haven't seen TDT in their stock yet. Hope you can acquire it!
