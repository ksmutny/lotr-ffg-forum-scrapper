The game still hasn't reached game stores in Sweden. Is anyone else going crazy waiting for their copy, or am I the only one?

Youre definately not alone. Stores in Europe have been snubbed.

A UK Royal Mail van drove into my street at 7.30 this morning, the driver got out, walked up the path to my front door and rang the bell...

So I'm now the owner of a core set. First impressions: excellent quality. Just how it is packed, the thought that has gone into it, extremely well done.

Have sleeved all the cards, popped the tokens, assembled the threat counters...now all I need is some peace and quiet to start my ambitious 'Full Matrix' project: 4 quests * 4 starter decks = 16 games.

After that, it's deckbuilding time!

 The game is available in Stockholm and have been for at least a week! Maybe you just need to move... ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

You got it in Norrtalje yet?  I lived in Sweden around the Stockholm area for a couple of years... a LONG time ago.  Nice country, good people... hella expensive.

Sf bokhandel i Stockholm has had it, but it's sold out already.

I preordered it from Amazon.ca back in March, and I'm still waiting for it to ship.  Amazon's shipping estimate is May 31... what the hell happened??

Rule of Thumb: Never order board games from Amazon!

Amazon may be great for ordering books and music but they totally suck when it comes to board games.

I never did get a ship date and ended up cancelling it. Still don't have the game yet :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

 Does 'waiting for it to arrive' count when you have a copy but cannot open it? It's a present for about a month out :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]
