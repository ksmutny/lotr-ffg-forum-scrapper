Greetings,

 

I am contemplating attending Gen Con this year, but probably just on the last day or two.  I know the events calendar is probably not going to be posted until May, but how do the LOTR events usually work at Gen Con?  Is there just one event on one day, and if so, which day is it usually on, or is there an event everyday?  I want to make sure I don't miss out on the Gen Con quest!  Thanks.

Last year there was at least one every day, but they filled up pretty quickly during event registration. If I recall correctly, two of the four days had sold out by the time it got to my place in line.

Last year they had events for every day except Sunday, but then added Sunday when the other events sold out right away.  My friend and I couldn't even get in to an event fast enough even though it was our #1 priority, thankfully got in on the Sunday event.

I really hope they increase the number of events, if this is the case.

In the past it's been one every day (last year they added an event to Sunday I believe.)  If you're going to Gencon just for the weekend, I would suggest to definitely do Saturday and not just Sunday.  The vendor hall is huge, it's fun to explore but it closes early on the last day (Sunday) and the events start tapering off throughout the day.  Saturday is generally the busiest day (for better or worse), it would have tons of events, and its also the costume contest/parade day so it's also the most amusing to people watch.

yea, the LotR events were rather small so they filled very quickly.  I hadn't set my priorities correctly when ordering tickets and they sold out.  Luckily they opened a Sunday event but didn't make any announcement about it so it didn't fill up that quick and my friend and I were able to get in.  The event itself is super casual. You show up and exchange your ticket for the quest, then you are basically free to just leave or to sit down and play the quest out.  While we were playing the FFG guys would walk around and check out how everyone was fairing against the quest and how we were handling any of the new things.  

 

In case you haven't gone to GenCon before - before event registration opens officially you can log into the Gen Con site, pick the events you want and set priorities for them.  Such as you really want to get into LotR but care less if you get into GoT, or whatever.  So get your tickets all picked out ahead of time. Then be at the computer and logged in before registration goes live.  As soon as it does, CLICK!   I waited about 1 second before pushing the "process" button last year and was something like 2,000 in line.    Things will go quickly for the smaller events with limited seats and/or for the hot items - like Netrunner.

I can second sloths experience. I registered seconds into when the events went live and barely made it into lotr. They also offer up seats when players don't show up to an event they registered for (happens all the time). If you have the patience to wait while everyone sits down, they will likely give you a spot when less than 100% of registered players show up. You'll need generic tickets equal to the cost of the event (which is 20ish, I believe.)
