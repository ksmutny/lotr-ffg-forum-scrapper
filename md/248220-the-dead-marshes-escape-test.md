If I fail the final escape test (Stage 2B), do I need to take the forced escape test by Gollum or go straight to the travel phase? 

If I have to take the forced escape test by Gollum, do I have a window of action before I start?

(Action window between "Final Escape Test / Escape Test By Gollum")

I responded also on BGG, but I'll also do it here -- on page 30, there's a green action window between "Resolve questing" (where 2b's final escape test would be) and the end of the quest phase.  This shows you do need to take the forced escape test by Gollum (since it happens at the end of the phase, while the 2b test is in step three [resolve questing), but you also have an action window to prepare for that test.
