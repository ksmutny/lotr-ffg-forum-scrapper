"Forced: After Chieftain Ufthak attacks, place 1 resource token on him." - that means we should place 1 token on him when it engages the defender or after he does attack (and has increased attack value for the next attack) ?

After he completes the attack.  That first attack will be for 3 attack strength.  If he attacks again next round, the attack will be for 5.

Hi. This one is in the FAQ -

Q. When do "after this enemy attacks" Forced effects like those on Chieftain Ufthak or Wargs resolve?

A. These effects resolve immediately after step 4 of enemy attack resolution.

So, yes, at the completion of the current attack, ready for the next attack.
