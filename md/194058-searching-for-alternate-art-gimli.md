Since FFG made the poor decision of not including the alternate art version of Gimli in de PoD of this years GenCon-Quest and since I am not able to attend GenCon because traveling from europe to GenCon is way to expensive for me, I am looking for someone who is willing to trade his copy of the alternate art Gimli card. Pls contact me via this thread or per PM that would be really awsome!

Yeah, as mentioned in another thread I am also on the lookout for a Gimli. As a LOTR LCG completist I am willing to pay a pretty good price  :-)

 

And hopefully, in the future, FFG will stop issuing special cards to such a limited audience. With the Nightmare and Fellowship events you at least have a chance as a non-US resident...

I could pay, too or trade it for an alternate art Legolas card from this years fellowship event.

Uping this post again still hoping that someone has a copy left for sell or trade against alternate art Legolas! Would be soooo nice to have an all alternate art eagles deck with Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli.

Well, that got ridiculous in a hurry.

Too bad

I found a copy for US$90 some months back. This is the predictable outcome when FFG decides to issue a special card in small numbers for an event that is impossible to attend for most of the game's fans.

If they want to build a secondary "rares" market with crazy prices, then this is what they are getting with this policy. I do not see their upside in this and I do not believe it is the idea / spirit of the LCGs.

The idea is they pretty much have to give out exclusives at these events and alternate art cards are the way to go, since they're not altering the game or adding to the card pool, just making your heroes look fancy.

This is the best possible outcome. Imagine if those cards had some actual gameplay alteration.

 

There was (or still is, I dunno) a game called Anima Tactics. A miniature wargame of sorts. And there was a regular version of a character, and a promo version of a character attained exclusively through various events and stuff. And what do you think? The promo was simply stronger. The same character, but stronger. I don't remember the details, but I think the promo version could carry an extra item or something.

 

Would you tolerate a promo Aragorn that has 1 more willpower at the same threat cost just because he is a promo, or anything like this? It's good that promos are simply rare collectibles with no game effect, it's the best possible outcome in this circumstances.

If you sleeve your cards .. get a scan of the altcard and put it into the sleeve of your hero .. done.

Dang. Maybe I should put my Gimli up for auction. Baby could use fifteen more adventure packs. :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

The Firefly board game has this with the heroes from the show getting stronger if you got the "big **** hero" pack.  Each of those characters got a bonus and it wasn't all that reliable to spread around among players. It was actually more likely a single player would get more than one, each providing further advantage.  Ultimately I had to remove them from the card pool for balancing.

Well, the Gen Con attendants do get to play the released POD expansion six months earlier than anybody else. I do not see why FFG needs to provide a special card on top of this. And if they do, why not make it part of the expansion as everyone thought it was in the first place.

I simply cannot see how FFG benefits from creating a collectors secondary market. It will earn them nothing and only frustrate a percentage of their customers.

They don't benefit, but they don't suffer for it either so it's win-win for them.
