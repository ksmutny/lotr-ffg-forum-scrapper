As the title explains, quick question about the forced keyword.

Does it happen everytime the requirment of the forced ability is met or only the first time?

Was curious since Marsh Adders had a forced which says 'Each time Marsh Adder attacks, raise

your threat by 1'. Does that mean all other forced abilities only happen 1 time?

no the forced effect is explained by the text after it so......each time or after damage is dealt. or after x attacks and so on, it is always possible to tell if and when a forced action happens as it always follows an event, if COULD happens once, say if a card says FORCED- after quest card 2b is revealed, but that doesnt mean all forced follow this example- it all depends on the card

hunt for gollum quest card forced happens every time you quest successfully for example

It will say in the Forced ability when it triggers.  "When X engages a player", that usually only happens once, barring Son of Arnor shenanigans.  "When X is defeated" usually happens once.  It's usually clear from the text.

If this is of any help, I compiled a list of effects and their timings in the turn sequence: http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=595428 [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=595428]
