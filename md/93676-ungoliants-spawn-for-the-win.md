 I was playing the first scenario in the core pack and the final quest was to kill Ungoliants Spawn. We knew it was in the discard pile. Do we reshuffle, or, do we keep playing and wait until we reshuffle the discard pile and find it that way? Also, what if the Spawn comes up as a shadow effect and is discarded? Sounds like we are missing something. Thanks 
Tim.

The quest tells you to search (in encounter deck and discard pile) for one spider per player to add to the staging area. I suggest that one of these be Ungoliant's spawn, otherwise (as noted) you will have a possibly long time to wait

Wow, talk about embarrassing. And the discard deck. Lol, well at least we would have beaten it, we were loaded for bear. Can't believe I didn't get that, oh well, we had fun until we ran into that. Thanks a lot for the help.
