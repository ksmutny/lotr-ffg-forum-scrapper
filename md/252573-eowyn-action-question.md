Hi

Regarding to the action below, could I discard more than 1 card in order to increase the willpower?

Action: Discard 1 card from your hand to give Eowyn +1 Willpower until the end of the phase. 

Thanks

If that was what Eowyn said then you would be free to trigger it multiple times, effectively discarding as many cards as you like for +1 each.

But, what the card actually says is: " Action: Discard 1 card from your hand to give Eowyn +1 Willpower until the end of the phase. This effect may be triggered by each player once each round. "

Note the underlined bit. That means you can only use it once per round, but in a multi-player game, other players can also use it, though also only once per round each. (This makes her noticeably stronger in larger games than in solo.)

Thanks for the clarification.
