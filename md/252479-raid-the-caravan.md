Now that you say it :blink: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_blink.png]

We will see how much progress is needed, but it seems that most bad effects can be countered by removing progress, somethings that was present in the very first quest of the cycle if i am not mistaken. In my memory that was something to consider durig the first one or two rounds and after changing stages, but appart from that it was more of a benefit than a punishment. I played solo and in a 4 man game things surely change, but I dare to say that true solo and duo/two-handed are the most common modes...

I am excited to see how they implement the "attacker feeling", because they pointed it out so much during the article. Will be extremely disappointed if we can't choose the order of the quest deck or have any other influence on the start or flow of the game...

And who is ready for the "zero-defense-mono-tactics-Hama-kill-it-before-it-lays-eggs-deck" with oath of eorl? :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Already try in Hama. If the deck is mono tactic thicket of spear is still better since you can do even if the ennemy don't die or at a friend house. It is only useful when you get 3 resource tactics but not on 3 different heroes. For exemple if you don't play mono tactic. Or if you use Mablung and get to engage multiple ennemy (one on wait no longer and one later).

Here is my actual Hama decklist with one oath of Eorl: http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/5223/hma-deck-for-multiplayer-use-1.0 [http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/5223/hma-deck-for-multiplayer-use-1.0]

1 card, 2 trait, 3 resources for an one time event?

Custom made for Denethor, Mablung and Hama?

Also Tactics Beregond, so you can also add Thicket of Spears for maximum protection.

The 1 card cost applies to virtually every card (all but the self-replacers).  The 2-trait requirement restricts the decks it can go in, but for decks that start with those two traits, it is a trivial requirement.

So is the effect event to small for 3 resources?  It's an extremely powerful event in the situation where you can take out multiple enemies if relieved of the requirement to defend, but that's rather situational.  I think the thing I like best about it is that since it messes with the game structure instead of targeting enemies, it can be used to take down bosses.  I also like that you're not constrained to attacking only your own enemies.

Unless the hero and the other 3 as of yet unrevealed player cards of this pack are ridiculously amazing, this is going to be one of the weakest AP's player card wise in a while.

## 14 [Rouxxor on June 21, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/252479-raid-the-caravan/?do=findComment&comment=2845851)

Still better than have a power creep. This pack contain over-specialized cards and I'm perfect with that. But yeah I will use less cards from this pack than from others. You are right about that.

## 15 [dalestephenson on June 21, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/252479-raid-the-caravan/?do=findComment&comment=2845938)

Are there more cards than Fearless Scout, Oath of Eorl, Burst Into Song and Old Toby revealed?  If it has the normal amount of player cards, that would leave five cards and a hero.

## 16 [Calvadur on June 21, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/252479-raid-the-caravan/?do=findComment&comment=2845985)

In the Announcement article "rally the west", a spirit sidequest (1 cost, 6 progress) that adds 1 willpower to all Heroes, was spoiled.

## 17 [Bullroarer Took on June 21, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/252479-raid-the-caravan/?do=findComment&comment=2846379)

A few years ago Caleb & Matt talked about trying to build the game out instead of up and I think they've done a pretty good job of that.  The straightforward power cards are still to be found in the first two cycles for the most part.  More recently the power comes from card interaction.

I don't think this is really a necessary clarification. Pretty much anyone who's played this game for a few years has noticed the fact that the game is supposed to be built horizontally rather than vertically. If you've played through Angmar Awakened and Dream-chaser you'll see how most cards are supposed to work in combination with others to great effect, but not so great on their own. The difference is that cards like, say, To the Sea! To the Sea! or Guardian of Arnor is that they're fantastic, while these are just boring. Now, ovbviously i haven't seen the rest of the cycle so I don't know if there's these amazing glue cards that will bring a Song or Pipe strategy to new heights, but I don't expect it to be so. If you look at these "poweful capstone" cards like Old Toby or Burst Into Song, they don't feel nearly as good as something like the ones I mentioned or stuff like Lords of the Eldar. Now, there's nothing really wrong with "fun" and "quirky" archetypes like Pipes or Songs, but you have to admit that even within this horizontal paradigm of combos and synergies, these cards feel very underpowered. Your comment strikes me as an apology for cards that direly need it because, you know, they're pretty bad. 

## 19 [Teamjimby on June 21, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/252479-raid-the-caravan/?do=findComment&comment=2847230)

I have to agree with Gizlivadi that this cycle of player cards has been quite disappointing.  I like that they are printing cards that only work in specific types of decks.  Unfotunately, the cards aren't even good enough to fit into the decks they were specifically designed for.  I have a pipe deck that I love, but I can't even justify slotting Old Toby into that because it is overcosted by at least 1.  Realistically, it is at best a "Draw 2 cards (and maybe heal 2 damage) for 2 resources".  I'd rather play Lorien's Wealth.  Fireside Song is another great example.  You have the huge restriction of needing both Songs and Hobbits, but most likely it will only be as good as a Celebrian's Stone.  If it cost 1 or did something else, that would be totally playable in the right deck, like it's supposed to be.

The dual-trait events are another problem.  Other than Unlikely Friendship, almost all of the dual-trait events feel like equal or worse versions of existing cards.  Those cards are more universally playable because it's not hard to get 2 traits, so it's more understandable.  But I wish they were just a little better.

Here's the cards from the cycle I think are exceptional bargains:

Greenwood Archer -- 2 attack for 2 resources in leadership, ranged and readying is just gravy.

Unlikely Friendship (needs Elf/Dwarf) -- self-replacing free resource

Wait no Longer -- skipping the quest reveal in solo is amazing

Steed of North -- ready on engage is dead useful

Dunedain Pathfinder -- like Dunedain Hunter, free allies for a one-time cost that the ally itself will help you pay.  Especially great with surging locations or locations with "when revealed" effect.

Steward of Orthanc -- 2 wp for 3 neutral resources isn't bad, but optionally tacking a doom-1 card draw to any event is amazing for solo non-Lore decks.

Red Arrow -- if you have a questing Gondorian, no reason to not have a copy of this in the deck.  +1 wp for 1 cost until you discard it for a free ally picked from your top five cards, at precisely the moment when a new ally would be most useful for combat.

This pretty much summarizes it for me. I too have a surprisingly good Pipe deck that works amazing in solo. I woud not include Old Toby in it. There's just not enough space, the card is not good enough for it.

## 23 [Edheliad on June 21, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/252479-raid-the-caravan/?do=findComment&comment=2847398)

Greenwood Archer's readying sounds really good until you realise it only works during planning when you're least likely to find it useful (combo shenanigans excepted).

2 attack ranged is nice in the sphere though for sure.

Yeah,  I usually buy packs depending on if I am interested in the player cards in the pack.    Since I started playing I have only missed a small handful of them.

I have not bought a single pack this cycle.   So that should pretty much tell you how I feel about the current crop of player cards.  I'm all for trying to curb power creep but,   that cat is already out of the bag on a ship that has sailed past the last domino that fell over.  The recent cards aren't interesting and they aren't good.

I've had success with Fireside Song, especially playing Shelob's Lair in campaign mode with a thematic Frodo/Sam/Galadriel deck: the only allies it contains are Core Gandalf and Elrond, and I avoid having them attack or do damage. Not having allies was not a problem once Sam was questing for 6+; he finished one playthrough with 6 songs on him (I was proxying Song of Hope, and Sam had four resource icons from different songs; Resourceful meant he could pay for anything I drew). Permanent willpower boosts in a non-swarm deck (where Sword that was Broken and Faramir are less useful) are rare in the game: Celebrían's Stone is unique, Strider (which I was playing, not counting Frodo towards the 2 hero limit) has significant restrictions, and other options don't boost a character's willpower by more than 1.

There aren't many great songs that can attach to Hobbit heroes, but when the neutral song attachments provide +1 willpower on top of access to additional spheres and resource smoothing, they're quite good. With Mirror of Galadriel and Silver Harp to tutor, I included two copies of Song of Battle to provide access to a useful card like Dagger of Westernesse (my only Tactics card, with 2 copies). I certainly don't think Fireside Song is overpowered, but it is the key card that provided enough willpower to recreate Frodo and Sam's tiny fellowship and still beat a challenging quest (Sting and Phial of Galdriel also helped). I haven't tested it fully, but it should also help for beating Shadow of the Past without killing any Nazgûl (using Frodo/Sam/Spirit Pippin, with Out of Sight and Hobbit Sense).

I did have Greenwood Archer appear during a combat phase A Very Good Tale-ing last night, which was a very nice way to add 5 attack to my Silvan deck's field when the Ringwraiths were starting to mount up.

If we are talking about powerful cards from the cycle, how has no one mentioned Hunting Party yet? Only 1 resource to discard most Trolls or Mumaks? Yes, please! Having trouble with that darn Wraith on Wings during The Battle of the Pelennor Fields? Now you can send him straight to the victory display. Debating how you are going to deal with that Corsair Warship? Once again,  BOOM! Straight to the Victory Display.

Of course you also have to reveal an additional encounter card, but there are many quests with non unique enemies that are significantly more awful than the average encounter card. And you can wait to use it - you don't need to save up a resource to play it as the enemy is revealed. You can keep that big dumb high engagement enemy sitting in the staging area for a while, and when you are worried about having to engage it, swap it out for another encounter card that is likely much nicer. Hunting Party rules.

Fair enough, Hunting Party can be good for certain quests.  Although it discards the enemies (instead of defeating), so they don't go to the victory display.

Hmmm yeah, I think you might be right. Otherwise Saruman ally would remove victory point cards from the game permanently. I'm kind of surprised it hasn't gone in the FAQ yet since the blurb in the rulebook seems pretty ambiguous to me.

That's got me wondering how many non-unique, non-immune enemies have victory points.  Here's the list:

Core: Hummerhorns (1), Hill Troll (2), Marsh Adder (1), Chieftain Ufthak (1), Dungeon Jailor (2)

Khazad-Dum/Dwarrowdelf: Cave-Troll (2), Great High-Troll (2), Elder Nameless Thing (3), Nameless Thing (5)

HofN/ATS: Lt of Mordor (1), Black Numenorean (1)

Isengard/Ringmaker: Mugash's Guard (3*)

Lost Realm/Angmar: none

Havens/Dreamchasher: none

Harad/Haradrim: none yet

saga before Flame of West: none

Flame of West: War Mumak (2), Wraith on Wings (4*)

Errata in a cooperative game with no OP support is meaningless. The only person affected by that is the person (or persons) who chooses to employ it into his games.

For a solo player this is certainly true, however there's two cases where errata is not meaningless:

1) When playing with others the others may not ignore errata.  This may affect the deck you wish to play.

2) When sharing decklists with other players online -- if a pre-errata card is important to it, the decklist will not be useful to the vast majority of players that don't ignore errata.

Of course, this also means that already published decks are affected by new errata.  In the case of Love of Tales this affected few decks, in the case of Master of Lore the card received errata quickly enough that it also affected few decks.  The Horn of Gondor errata affected many, many decks that were already published, including probably every Eagle deck that had been made to that point.

## 40 [NathanH on July 2, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/252479-raid-the-caravan/?do=findComment&comment=2863425)

Although I normally agree that ignoring errata is a sensible choice, it does mean that you have to constantly evaluate whether new cards, designed under the assumption of the errata, break when using the old rules. Probably the major challenge for the old Horn of Gondor rules is Tactics Imrahil. We play Horn of Gondor by the old rules, and Tactics Imrahil is a bit silly with it.

## 41 [Yepesnopes on July 2, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/252479-raid-the-caravan/?do=findComment&comment=2863476)

Response: When an enemy is added to the staging area, exhaust Horn of Gondor to add a resource to the hero resource pool.

 

That is how Horn of Gondor should have been errated from the very begining.

This is a non sequitor. Even in solo play it's not meaningless. It's only meaningless to the subset of players that only play solo and choose to never employ any errata. That's a much weaker statement.

And I'd suggest to anyone in that camp to take a look at the errata anyway. Like many others I think certian rulings could have been better, but in some cases, such as the Zigil Miner, it takes an outright broken card and turns it into a card that is not only balanced, but really fun.

## 44 [Gizlivadi on July 3, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/252479-raid-the-caravan/?do=findComment&comment=2863695)

If errata in a co-op game is meaningless, so is any other rule in that game. Errata are just new rulings added to the game, you can choose not to follow them but they basically prescript the most balanced and non-broken way the game should be played, just like the rule that says you draw 1 encounter card per player during the quest phase.

Frankly, as a player that came in after those errata, I don't even think that those errata were done poorly.

In my opinion, neither card is unplayable now, they just aren't top-tier powerhouses. I find both of them useful in the right circumstances.

Horn of Gondor isn't unplayable now, but it's *not* nearly as useful in hundreds of published decks (including a second breakfast by the game's designer) .  Introducing a new card that doesn't exhaust and rewards for chump blocking I wouldn't have an issue with.  Changing the existing card so it exhausts I could understand, even though it would makes the card marginally less useful.  Changing the existing card so it works *differently* is a problem; it also specifically works much less well with the two tribal traits that are most developed in the first cycle of the game (Eagles, Rohan).  The only saving grace is that as a 1x card in the core set, it was not common enough to be essential for new players anyway.

I don't find Master of Lore useful in the right circumstances; I've put in a mono-lore deck, but not because I have any illusions that it's worth it.  Master of Lore takes a minimum of three turns to pay for itself, for a fragile ally with no other special abilities -- that's not good value even if you have a steady stream of 2+ cost itself.  The *original* master of Lore wasn't a "top-tier powerhouse" because it only reduces to a minimum cost of one, it could be worth it in the right deck but was only "broken" when combined with an actual resource generator that *didn't* exhaust, the aforementioned pre-errata Horn of Gondor.  If the designers had done the right errata for Horn of Gondor then, or even the wrong errata that they would later do when a different broken deck was invented, there would've been no need for the Master of Lore nerf.

Not saying that the way things ended up couldn't have been handled better from a historical perspective. But as I said, my perspective is post errata. I didn't have the experience of having hundreds of decks invalidated. If I had, maybe I'd think the errata was wrong too. But I didn't.  And as I said, I don't see a problem with it.

As far as master of lore goes, Warden of arnor has used the card productively in his progression series. Or pair it with Grima, where it pays for itself the turn after you've played it.

Cost reduction doesn't work like that. When you spend Grima's reduction on a MoL, you are giving up a reduction you could have used on another card.

Fair enough. That's a good point. I'll own my mistake there.

Ancillary to my overall point - which was meant to be (I may have gotten sidetracked) that I don't have a problem with the errata of MoL. Doesn't even mean that I couldn't think of ways they could have done it better - just that I don't have an issue with it as it currently stands. YMMV

Are you freaking shipping me?

Isn't that what I just said?
