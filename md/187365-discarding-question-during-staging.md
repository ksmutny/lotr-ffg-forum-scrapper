Maybe this question seems rather irrelevant, but it came up during construction for a deck of mine.

 

During staging if you draw a treachery encounter card with surge, you resolve the when revealed effect then you resolve surge. no problem there.

then if you draw a second card which is countered and doesn´t come to effect (with the help of Minas Tirith Lampwright) which one is discarded first to the discard pile?

As of the reading of the lampwright i would mean the first card would be discarded first, as it states to discard the second card after it is revealed.

Or more simple, am i right to say that cards with surge are always discarded before any new cards are drawn from the encounter deck due to the surge effect?

 

I know this seems confusing and irrelevant but for me it is not^^
