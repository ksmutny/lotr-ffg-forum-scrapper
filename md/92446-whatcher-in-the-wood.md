How much threat must you raise? The total added of all players? Or each player reach only his own?

Yep, one of those game-ending cards in games with big players, but in a solo game you cross your fingers and hope to get this card because it is very benign compared to some of the other nastiness in those decks...

You could avoid it questing not so much, but by the other hand, there is then other bad treachery, lol:
