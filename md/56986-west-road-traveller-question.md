 I have a question about West Road Traveller

 

Response:  After you play West Road Traveller from your hand, switch the active location with any other location in the staging area.

 

When you use her ability - do you still have to follow any travel effects from the location card (if they have a TRAVEL effect)?

OR, does this card get around travel effects (meaning, that it isn't considered traveling their as you are just replacing the card with another)?

Since the keyword is that you are switching locations, not traveling to a location, then the travel effect should not apply.

 The best scenario for West Road Traveller would be to switch out an active location that has a positive travel affect with a location that has a negative one. This way you could gain the benefits twice. Forest Gate would be a good example, which allows the first player to draw two cards when you travel there.

I do not have the card yet but I hope the answer is there is no travel effect - they might have mentioned it to make sure though.

Also, it is interesting that is says "after you play it from your hand", which means it does not take effect when you use Stand and Fight or Sneak Attack, right?

Sneak Attack says specifically to " put 1 ally card into play from your hand", so you should still be able trigger this effect. You are correct that Stand and Fight would not work though because it comes into play from he discard pile.

 There is a difference between "play" and "put into play".  "Play" means you play it from your hand after paying its cost.  "Put into play" is an instruction that gets a card into play but will not trigger "play" effects.

Yes, the FAQ is explicit about this:

"Put into play" effects
are not considered to be playing the card, and will not
trigger any effects that refer to a card being played.
"Put into play" will, however, trigger any effects that
occur when a card "enters play".

Very subtle difference.

 Interesting. Is Gandalf the only character that has an "enters play" effect?

Nope. Snowbourn Scout, Miner of the Iron Hills, Longbeard Orc Slayer, Son of Arnor, Keen-Eyed Took and Descendant of Thorondor all have "enters play" effects. 

Erebor Hammersmith and Rivendell Minstrel have "after you play" and "after you play from your hand" effects, which are far more restrictive.
