"Ever my heart rises" is a spirit attachment

 

Condition. [/Cards/Search?Trait=Condition.]

Attach to a Dwarf [/Cards/Search?Trait=Dwarf] character.
 

Response: After you travel to a Mountain [/Cards/Search?Trait=Mountain.] or Underground [/Cards/Search?Trait=Underground.] location, ready attached character and reduce your threat by 1.
 
My question is: If my character is not exhausted when I travel to the mountain or underground location, does that mean that i cannot reduce my threat by 1 (since I can't ready him and therefore meet the first part of the condition)?

> yes you can.

Agreed: if it said "THEN reduce your threat", then you would need the character to be exhausted and then ready to get the threat reduction..
