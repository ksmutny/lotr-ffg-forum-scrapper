Torture Chamber: If Torture Chamber has 4 or more resource tokens on it, all "prisoners" were killed, and the players have lost the game.

Forced: At the end of each round, place 1 resource token on each Dol Guldur location in play.

 

 

Does the text regarding the prisoners being killed still happen if they were rescued?  We were playing that it doesn't, since it doesn't make much thematic sense (unless that shadow effect that imprisons another character goes off, then we treat Torture Chamber as dangerous again).

If they are rescued already they are not a prisoners anymore right? So you can ignore that location effect in this case
