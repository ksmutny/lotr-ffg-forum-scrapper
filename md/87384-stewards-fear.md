In the Steward's Fear adventure, clearing the Cave of Mindolluin gives "+2 Quest points" to all other locations.  I can't seem to find anywhere what the heck "quest points" are.  Does anyone have any idea what this means?

Quest points are how much progress tokens need to be placed on that location to explore it.  Kinda wierd i know.  I almost forgot what ques points mean just a day or 2 ago :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]
