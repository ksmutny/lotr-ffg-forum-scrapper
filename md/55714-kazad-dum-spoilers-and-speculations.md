Hey gang,

Thanks to our friends at cardboardoftherings (on Facebook) we have spied a new article on Khazad-dum from Game Trade Magazine

http://www.gametrademagazine.com/public/default.asp?t=1&m=1&c=58&s=591&ai=114117&ssd [http://www.gametrademagazine.com/public/default.asp?t=1&m=1&c=58&s=591&ai=114117&ssd]

It reveals Dwalin as one of the two Dwarf heroes!

Also, in a rush of nerdiness, I figured out what other dwarves could be a possible hero for the set.

Still alive at the time of the quest:

Bombur

Bofur

Bifur

Nori

Dori

also Dain II Ironfoot

So my guess is one of these chaps will be the other hero. I removed any of the twelve dwarves who died or any of them who went into Khazad-dum with Balin (I just figured it wouldn't make sense to be one of the dwarves you're looking for...)

I think it will be Dain

 There's an MEQ Dwarf that hasn't turned up yet (Nain?), so my money's on him.

Thalin is MEQ Dwarf, at least talking about Heroes (Dain II is a character in MEQ). Eometh (Rohan) and Argalad (Woodland Realm) have yet to show up from MEQ as anything in LotR yet.

Also, great ability on Dwalin... "Response: After Dwalin attacks and destroys an Orc enemy, reduce your threat by 2." Great fit for Spirit!

The Cave-troll has a similar ability to the Hill Troll, however, instead of raising your Threat, every excess point of damage must be used to damage other characters you control. Weak blockers won't work against this one, even with a Threat reduction deck.

It's a convenient way to get some damage tokens on Gimli or Gloin at least.

 

Dwalin looks okay. If he had one more attack, I'd really love him.

 

I really hope the other Dwarf is a Lore hero.

My best guess is that it will be so they can have a dwarf in every sphere. If that's so, I would also deduce that the next hero (for Return to Mirkwood) will be a leadership hero. My hope is for Thranduil.

No, they're from the board game Middle-Earth Quest as well as 3 characters you're playing with since the release of the card game (beravor, thalin, eleanor). So: they're not from the book but we will definitely see them ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

 Gwaihir as a Hero would be friggin' awesome. It would guarantee my purchase of the pack. (Not that I've been all that selective :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png])

It would be nice to have Bombur as a Hero. He can use the event card Belly Roll to knock out the enemy :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

But the idea of Gwaihir is not bad at all! The only problem is; we are in the mines of Moria. FFG will not place the King of Eagles in some dusty mines. If Gwaihir would become a Hero, I think FFG will use it in a later adventure pack.

I vote for Bombur...... and maybe Saruman (before he became bad and corrupt ) as a neutral ally

I was referring to the Hero for the Return to Mirkwood pack (OT, I know). Gwaihir must be in there somehow, it would be silly not to have the Lord of the Eagles finishing off this theme, and he would fit a Leadership role (maybe with some Tactics synergy).

Just out of curiosity, has anyone at FFG commented on how committed they are to keeping quests within the timeline stated in the Core set? (I can't imagine that their licensing would actually restrict them to this one slice of time, though I suppose it's possible.)

@ ClydeCloggie: But wouldn't it be silly to have all eagle-related cards in the tactics-sphere, and the eagle hero in leadership? If there's an eagle hero, it will be tactics. And since we already have two tactics-heroes in this cycle, there won't be an eagle hero for now. That's my reasoning.

What if Gwaihir is a Leadership Hero, but with the special ability that he can spend his resources on Eagle cards?

That's my thought too.

Maybe FFG will put it in the Dwarrowdelf cycle

I know, that is a bit of a problem. However, there is a precednee with Rhoan allies in Leadership and Tactics, when all other Rohan cards are Spirit. It might also be a Leadership Hero that has synergy with the Tactics sphere; that woud fit the Leadership 'spread the wealth around' theme.

Most likely, though, we'll get Gwaihir as a Tactics ally and someone else as Leadership Hero.

I bet we get Gwaihir in Mirkwood, as a Tactics ally. And I am looking forward to that.

I hope we get Thranduil as a Leadership hero, but that is not a guess, and is very likely a hopeless wish. It would make sense (to me at least) as all the "fathers" have been different spheres to Tactics "sons" as heroes - Denethor to Boromir, Gloin to Gimli. Thranduil to Legolas would seem fit. But then one day we shall have Theoden and he may well be Spirit or Tactics to Theodred being Leadership. I shall stop ranting now.

How about contents of the expansion box? It is so called "deluxe" expansion so it would be nice to see something else than only cards in there, especially since its such a big box ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] I dont know, some new tokens, counters, anything? What you guys think? How about other FFG games "deluxe" expansions contents?

CoC LCG and W:I both have deluxe expansions that I own, neither came with anything other than cards IIRC (plus rules insert).

No thanks. 'Luxury' content doesn't come for free and I'd rather not pay for something that isn't required for gameplay. I'd much rather they added more cards.
