Do i have to use Galadriel's passive ability even though i wouldn't want to? As an example Arwen (ally) who needs to exhaust in order to give the defense boost. 

My guess is that i have to always keep my characters ready even if i wouldn't want to but i just to make shure.

Yes, you cannot ignore Galadriel's passive.
