I know there are a fair number of players who focus primarily on gameplay and couldn't care less about lore, but for anyone else interested in Middle Earth, I would recommend checking out the Tolkien Professor if you haven't already.  He is a very knowledgeable Tolkien scholar whose discussions are both fun and informative.  His podcasts include talks of The Hobbit [http://tolkienprofessor.com/lectures/the-hobbit/] and other Tolkien works [http://tolkienprofessor.com/lectures/courses/] (including the legendary Silmarillion Seminar!).

One of his current projects is Exploring the Lord of the Rings [https://mythgard.org/activities/mythgard-on-lotro/exploring-lotr/], which is a weekly course going very closely through the Lord of the Rings (we've been at it about a year, and we've just now reached the point of Tom Bombadil rescuing the hobbits from the barrow).  Through Twitch and Discord, not only is this a rather informative class, but people can also ask questions of the Professor and offer their own insights.  Each class also includes a "field trip" within Lord of the Rings Online to examine their adaptation of Tolkien's world.

Does anyone else have any favorite sources of lore?  And speaking of being off-topic, just when are we going to get a Scouring of the Shire adventure pack so we can actually finish up the story?

I'm pretty ignorant about the LOTR lore but thanks for your information. When I need any lore information I go to a french encyclopedia ( http://www.tolkiendil.com/bienvenue [http://www.tolkiendil.com/bienvenue]) or ask to friends of mine who know perfectly the books ^^.

We will have a Scouring of the Shire POD someday, but it will probably be fan-made since there is no sign of FFG.

I would add the source books for The One Ring RPG by Cubicle 7. These books do an awesome job of detailing out what we know about specific parts of Middle-earth and they're not afraid to pencil in the details. They're also beautifully illustrated, which is a big plus.
