# [Newbie question for deck customization... 50 cards?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/51443-newbie-question-for-deck-customization-50-cards/)

## 1 [OjoDelPensador on August 12, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/51443-newbie-question-for-deck-customization-50-cards/?do=findComment&comment=513624)

 First, I'd like to say I wish there were a search utility for strictly the LOTR:TCG forum.  I'm sure this question is dealt with in the forum already, but I can't find it easily.  When I did a search, the search options forced me to include the full scope of "Living Card Games", and there was no way to filter that down to just LOTR:TCG.  Is there some hidden mechanism for doing a better search?

My question is about custom deck creation.  The rules manual says a correctly built tournament deck will have a minimum of 50 cards.  I was trying to build a deck from Lore and Spirit using the decks that came with the starter set.  50 cards uses all but a small handful of them; not much customization to do with just 2 spheres of influence.  Am I missing something?

Regards,

Bruce

No you aren't missing anything.  As time goes on you will accumulate more and more cards from the monthly adventure packs and expansions that will provide you much more flexibility.  I might also suggest that if you are going to really get into deck building that you may want to invest in a second core set to increase your options.

No, you're not missing anything. Right now the card pool is small. Will probably take this entire Mirkwood set of Adventure Packs to come out before each sphere has enough variety, at least.

If you can get your hands on the two Adventure Packs released so far, they come with Song cards that add a specific sphere to hero cards when attached. Using those you can go 3 and even 4 sphere in your decks. It's ugly and can rely more on the luck of the draw that way but it can work.

For now don't be afraid to go less than 50. It can actually help you draw the stuff that'll work instead of having all of that situational filler.

Or you could burn through that disposable income and buy multiple Core Sets to have 3 of each card. Some of us can't bring ourselves to do that right now. Gas ain't cheap.

Hi Bruce,

no, thats normal. E.g. I just counted only 40 Tactics cards (plus 3 heroes) with 1 core set and the 2 released adventure packs. But the card pool will increase with additional adventure packs being released.

Strange that you can't search only in the LotR LCG forum. Did you click on the "Search the Forums" button somwehre on the upper right, and select "The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game" in "Search in Forum" list? Don't forget the "The", this happened to me the first time I tried to search

Yeah, I tried it as well earlier and had no luck. It comes back with zero results when you search for something. Might be a typo in the code somewhere that causes a discrepancy between how the game is listed in the drop down game listing and how it's spelled in the code. It's always the little things.

 Thanks, all, that all makes sense... and now that I *look* for "The" LOTR:TCG in the menu, I'm able to narrow my search.  Silly me!  :-P

A friend and I just played the Passage Through Anduin scenario.  Thought we were going to get smacked, but it proved much easier in the end than we expected.  I expect our final score was not very noteworthy (80) as we both had a serious level of threat by the end.  I had only worked through about 15 cards in my deck.  Is that typical?  Sure makes the 50 card deck minimum really lower percentages of getting useful cards.

Bruce

Good Luck!

As for now, each sphere has 19 cards available, plus 3 neutral ones. I hope in time we will have gone past 100 per sphere plus some 10 to 20 neutral ones. I hope.

Hey bene malos,I made it through with only 22 points of course I only had about 28 cards plus three heroes but still for solo that's pretty good, right?

Another thing if your threat level is lower than 30 you can avoid the hill troll in the passage through anduin scenario and you can get more cards from your deck :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] ;I
