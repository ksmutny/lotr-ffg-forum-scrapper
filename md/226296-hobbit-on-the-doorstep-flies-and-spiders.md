Hi all,

I believe this is my first post here. I play and collect the game fr quite several years already, but never had actually time to play really every quest I have. I just recently started to play Hobbit saga and I found few questions that I have an issue to answer regarding the scenario Flies and Spiders.

Please not that I play true solo - only one deck.

 

1) Quest 2B including the errata. If I understand correctly, when I am the only player playing the game, it will look like this:

I finish 1B, open 2B, 3A+B stage will be started for my fellowship (everyone except Bilbo unconcious, every resource gone). In same time 4B will be started, moving whole staging area with it, Spiders Glade added. Since there is noone on stage 4. 2B is discarded away.

So far I think it is clear. Now.

When I play through with my Bilbo on 3B and noone is on 4B, does the Spiders Glade Forced effect trigger? I played in a way that yes, but I have to say, that it is quite cruel in that way and I am suspicious that I played it wrong, as there is maybe no quest phase to start, when there is no player. (same will apply if all the heroes/players on stage 4 dies).

 

2) What will happen with venom if I do not have draw deck? I have quite fast drawing deck playing Ents, so I was gone with cards on 3B already. Does it mean, that I can not get poison afterwards?

 

Thank you anyone for input.

question 2- If there are no cards left in your deck, you can't be poisoned anymore.  The Venom keyword won't do anything.

 

question 1- Advance to stage 3 with your deck.  Make a separate staging area.  Since there are no other plays in the game, you'll discard the original staging area.  Nobody advances to stage 4 because there are no other players in the game. Spider's Glade does not enter play at this point.

 

Once you get through stage 3, you'll advance to stage 4 and then Spider's Glade will come into play.

Ah thank you very much for answers.

Ok, than I played it wrong as I put Spiders Glade into play immediately and draw 1 spider every turn to stage 4. Still beat it anyway :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

What happens if you play the game multiplayer and you beat stage 4B before you beat stage 3B? Do you win the game?

 

Thank you,

You have to clear The Spider’s Glade location before you can defeat stage 4. The stage 4 quest card prevents you from placing progress tokens on it until you’ve cleared that location.

  To do that, you have to exhaust Bilbo.  If Bilbo is at stage 3, you can’t use him to pay the travel cost of The Spider’s Glade — cards at one staging area cannot affect cards in the other staging area.  So you’ll have to beat stage 3, bring Bilbo to stage 4, then travel to The Spider’s Glade before you can begin to place progress on stage 4.

Ok great thank you, I did not catch that anywhere. That makes a lot more sense!

One other question, that was not addressed by the rule book. What does a player do if they are playing two hands and when they split the staging areas the player in the 4B staging area gets eliminated. Does the staging area gain back all of the engaged spiders and then remain as is until Bilbo and the first player beat the 3B questing card?

This just happened and I am kind of stuck. 

I think you should be able to start stage 4B over again when they complete stage 3B, but that seems a bit easier than LOTR LCG tends to be.

 

Thank you,

If the last player on stage 4B die, no more cards will be revealed in this stage and everything that is still in the staging area will wait the Bilbo player for the moment he came out.
