"Players do not raise their threat at the end of the refresh phase."

But, we don't normally raise our threat at the end of the refresh phase do we? The core rulebook says that raising our threat occurs during the refresh phase, and shows a player action window between raising our threat and the end of the phase. So according to the rules, the first line on Barad-dur doesn't actually do anything. We should all still be raising our threat by 1 each turn on top of the +X threat from the Forced effect.

If we had Facebook reactions to posts, I would have had a "sad" react instead of a "like."

Another instance of a card whose intent is clear, but which doesn't really jive with the rules as written. :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

Isn't the end of the round and the end of the refresh phase the same moment? In that case, the only effect of the first line is to cause the forced effect to do nothing...

End of refresh phase triggers must happen before end of round triggers, I believe. This is why you literally cannot grief someone by Desperate Alliance'ing them Erestor in the refresh phase, even if they wanted to be griefed.
