 Is it correct that if one has abandoned tools and exhausts a character, that the progress token still goes on the quest card even if there is an active location?  I am assuming yes since it is a different type of action and occurs during a different phase of the round.

 I would say yes, mostly because it refers to the quest card explicitly by name.

 I thought that too.
