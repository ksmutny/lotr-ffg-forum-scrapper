Hello,

 

I'm new to the LoTR card game and my son and I have a couple of questions I was hoping you could help with.

 

1.) When playing with Dunhere (Hero) his ability states he can attack into the staging area. Can you provide input what this means. Does this mean he can attack any creature he wants without engaging it? (The creature would not get to hit back?

 

2.) If you have a character you are questing with, and you have an ability to read it can you quest with it again doubling it's "WILL"?

 

3.) If a character card has an "ACTION" that states to excaust it for something to trigger, can you send them on a quest and exauset at the same time and will that character quest and be able to trigger the effect?

 

Thank you,

1. It means exactly what is written: he attacks an enemy which is in a staging area, not engaged with you or any other player.

 

2. No, yo can only commit a character once and his Will counts only once.

 

3. When you commit a character to a quest you (usually) exhaust him/her. That character must be ready again to perform an Action that demands exhausting.

 

Hope this helps :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

To add on question 3. A Response could be triggered like with the Arwen Ally [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/dwarrowdelf/the-watcher-in-the-water/arwen-undomiel-twitw] (you do not yet posses I guess).

You could think of 'commiting to a quest' being an action, thus you can't trigger any other actions too that also require exhaustion.

Thank you very much for your help.

I have one more thing to ask about question 1. So I'm clear he can attack into the staging area, but does that mean he can deal damage to the creature in the staging area without worrying about the creature hitting back?

So it's like free damage?

Yes.

If you can keep that enemy in the staging area (threat lower than him or woth help of some cards) you can do it.

During the combat phase:

1) all ENGAGED enemies make an attack against player(s)

2) than you can declare attackers agains engaged ememies. And during this step you can declare and exhaust Dunhere to attack enemy in the staging (and yes, it did not attack you because it was not engaged), but he HAS TO ATTACK ALONE and deffense of the enemy stil counts (like in normal attack).

 

Just one thing I ould like to add:

Can dunhere attack outside of the attack phase?

## 7 [GrandSpleen on March 20, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/174647-questions-for-new-player/?do=findComment&comment=2113948)

No, Dunhere has to make his attacks during the combat phase, when you have your regular chance to declare attacks.

Can quick strike be used outside of combat phase?

## 10 [CJMatos on March 20, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/174647-questions-for-new-player/?do=findComment&comment=2114020)

Yes. Quick Strike can be used outside of combat phase.

 

After playing it, the character you exhaust attacks and then game progress from the point where it was when you played Quick Strike

Just in case there is a combat error carried over from magic the gathering. When you attack an enemy you deal damage, but the enemy does not. When an enemy attacks you it deals damage, but you do not. Characters and enemies only deal damage when attacking, not when blocking or defending an attack.
