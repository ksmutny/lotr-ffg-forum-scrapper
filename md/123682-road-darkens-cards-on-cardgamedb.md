My copy&paste is broken... but there is a Wizard pipe now and the Phial of Galadriel. Seems like they are in the middle of adding all cards. Keep refreshing! =)

Even with Hobbit Gandalf, this is an interesting form of pseudo card draw that allows you to swap a card that you can't/won't play this round with a new card in the hopes that you can find something more useful.

Also, another interesting aspect: it isn't unique, so you could get one out on Radagast and Sarumon, though it's less useful on Sarumon. Smoke Rings could then potentially lower your threat by 6... though you'll rarely pull that off.

The pipe is really useful, nothing to complain there. It's a shame we didn't get Narya, which will make Gandalf an even more viable hero, but hopefully we'll get it in this cycle.

Don't dig the art. Looks like a 3-d render to me, at least from that low-res perspective. And 3-d render posed as an art is worst type of art in my opinion.

I agree with MyNeighbourTrololo that the art isn't really great..

But an Istari form of deck is starting to being put together. I also would really like Narya for Gandalf! Would be cool to run a Elven Ring of Power deck, with Galadriel keeping your threat at the same level and then just lower it with some reduction like Elronds Counsel so it can be a viable deck.

Wow. That's an awesome combo. I don't know if I ever would have thought of that. Of course, it's a 3 card combo, so it's not super efficient, but why not try it? Potentially a 4-card combo if you're not using Hero Gandalf.

"The Road Darkens contains 165 cards that introduce three new scenarios to the game, along with two heroes, twenty-seven player cards (three copies each of nine different player cards)"

 

So there IS still a card missing it seems...

If Gandalf counts as a player card then they are all accounted for.

Heroes do not count as player cards, at least in FFG's articles.

It specifically says 27 player cards (3 copies of each) and if Gandalf is one of them, I don't think we'll get 3 copies of him.

Yeah, that was my thought also, three copies of each, so Gandalf probably won't be counted as one of them. Cool. 

Hope remains   for Narya

Yea... I don't see where the 9th player card would go... I don't see it coming after the Boons. Due to the wording of "27 player cards (3 copies of each)", there's no way they mean to include Gandalf. And thus far, heroes haven't been included with those counts in articles. So, did they scratch a card after that announcement?

## 24 [Gizlivadi on October 1, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/123682-road-darkens-cards-on-cardgamedb/?do=findComment&comment=1284164)

It could be that they scraped the card or that the article had a mistake, but I think and hope they'll keep the card for the release article. Anyway, some people are getting it today, so all our doubts will be cleared by them.

## 25 [joezim007 on October 1, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/123682-road-darkens-cards-on-cardgamedb/?do=findComment&comment=1284205)

Even if that 9th player card does materialize, this is the first saga expansion that has a single-digit number of "normal-sphere" non-hero player cards. Currently we have 7 player cards that we know of plus one true hero. This is worse than an adventure pack, even with the Fellowship cards included!

I've got to make a disclaimer, though: I kinda like fewer player cards. Why?

1) I'll have a chance to try a greater number of them.

2) It apparently allowed them to focus more and create better cards; I would consider Flame of Anor to be the weakest of the bunch, but with the Gandalf hero and/or the Wizard Pipe even this card can be very good.

## 26 [MyNeighbourTrololo on October 1, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/123682-road-darkens-cards-on-cardgamedb/?do=findComment&comment=1284246)

I, on the other hand, don't like it, and I'll tell you for why:

1) Having a chance to try greater number of cards virtually depends on their amount (the lesser them - the more chance to try), but all it really depends is viability and versatility, and that's exactly where the more - the better;

2) Out of 7 non-hero player cards, we got only 4 independent ones. Flame of Anor, Gandalf's Staff and Wizard Pipe all were (obviously) created to support new Gandalf hero and just happen to be able to support some other existing player cards, and not with that spectacular effect as they would support the Gandalf hero. Reminds of anything? (Spirfindel and Light of Valinor)

 

I applaud the designers for making 2 of them playable on other Istaries instead of just slapping an "attach to Gandalf" on all of them. Not that it makes a lot of difference at the moment, but I sincerely hope for some other Istari hero somewhere in the future, maybe they'll promote Radagast, maybe they'll get some courage to implement a Blue Wizard, or maybe my dream will come true and Saruman himself will ascend as a hero to help us on our journeys. But for now it's just a foundation, which is good, but not that great as it could be.

As much as the cards were there to support the new Gandalf hero, I'm actually quite excited by their ability to improve Hobbit Gandalf. As long as a deck can handle the threat gains from Hobbit Gandalf, he's suddenly way more powerful and brings a lot to the game. He was already really strong because he could commit 4 willpower to questing while also commiting 4 defense or attack every single turn. No hero can claim that without at least 3 attachments. Now we can give Gandalf some attachments to make him even more effective and they can aid your heroes.

 

I'd definitely love to see something that can really make Radagast better specifically, though. Even if it can work on the Gandalfs, I think it should be more targeted toward Radagast.

The Gandalf ally will always be inferior to the Gandalf hero regarding those attachments because of one single reason: with Gandalf hero you've already got your base material in play, all you need is to draw your Gandalf-enhancements and play them, while building all that stuff around Gandalf ally could easily fail with a bad draw. BUT, even if you draw Gandalf first turn, unless you have some cunning way of putting him into play forever(all of which are also luck-based to my knowledge, think a very good tale or timely aid) - you need to pay 5 resources for him, and that's 166% worth of one turns resources, and then you'll need to draw and pay for every stuff you wanted to give him, so you'll need a complete focus and that's gonna be hard. A lot harder than just having Gandalf around from the turn 0, all ready to go.

Also, ally Gandalf is a lot more vulnerable to encounter effects (Knife in the Back, to name only one).

To me the Wizard's Pipe seems too much like Gandalf's Light of Valinor (i.e. Spirit Glorfindel). It takes the one weakness Gandalf had (minus the threat) and nullifies it. I think they made a mistake with Spirit Glorfindel and LoV and I think this is a mistake as well. I may be wrong though, only time will tell.

You're forgetting Elf-Stone. In any case, I'm talking about taking a deck that already uses Gandalf and making it better. I've played some decks that used Hobbit Gandalf to some amazing effect, and I have no problem paying for him on turn 2 or 3 if I have to; he's worth the resources and the wait. It honestly doesn't matter if his attachments don't show up. They're just making a great thing better because, like I said, Gandalf is better than a 4th hero, so he doesn't need the attachments.

Elf-Stone is even worse - you need a location, you need to travel there, and you need to explore it. And on the top of it, if it's multiplayer, you need to be the first player while it all happening, not to mention having both Gandalf AND Elf-Stone in your opening hand.

I don't understand why everyone is so obsessed with this. Why do you think there's a card missing? The hero counts as a player card. If you don't count Frodo there's 9 cards.

Incorrect, as debated before, they said 9 * 3 yimes the new player cards, so they didn't count Gandalf as one of them. Also they didn't count heroes as player cards before in announcements.

Wizard Pipe completely eliminates the one challenge that I faced when splashing a sphere that did not belong to one of the heroes in a deck.  This problem actually made Gandalf interesting to build around because there was the potential of getting dead cards stuck in hand, so I was relying on Gildor ally for 5 resources.  Now the pipe makes it easy to move these cards back to the top of the deck, so now I can pretty much put any off sphere card into a deck and have a chance to play it.  If it was not for gandalf's high threat I'd say he's pretty broken.  

 

I'm still quite intrigued to build some decks with him, but when testing him out I started to find that Gandalf's style of play became pretty boring. with too much player deck manipulation for my taste.  It was similar to Elrond Vilya, which I also find boring and broken.  Makes many scenarios easy.  It's the same story with Gandalf. 

 

I understand why the developers designed wizard pipe.  It eliminates Gandalf's one handicap, but now the only thing going against him is high threat, which can be worked around easy enough.

Yes, I had been hot-linking to those qr/MEC images but the webmaster of CardGameDB warned me about a month ago that they would be going away.

> Wizard Pipe completely eliminates the one challenge that I faced when splashing a sphere that did not belong to one of the heroes in a deck.  This problem actually made Gandalf interesting to build around because there was the potential of getting dead cards stuck in hand, so I was relying on Gildor ally for 5 resources.  Now the pipe makes it easy to move these cards back to the top of the deck, so now I can pretty much put any off sphere card into a deck and have a chance to play it.  If it was not for gandalf's high threat I'd say he's pretty broken.

I agree completely. I compered it to the LoV with Spirit Glorfindel. I suppose there is another downside (i.e. no one else can use Gandalf), but the card pool I think is big enough now that that is not that big of an issue.

Left cards at the office, wasn't crazy about watcher art, just some tentacles, it was decent I suppose. High stats, indestructible, immune to player effects. He takes Frodo and you have to do 6 damage before he lets Frodo go and then you can quest through Doors of Durin. Seems like a very cool quest

The art on the Uruk Hai looks awesome! So does Storm of Howls and Great Cave Troll. Really like that version of a troll, very different from anything else we've seen before. It does however share the exact same name as an existing encounter card which is a little strange:

ffg_great-cave-troll-kd.jpg [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/ffg_great-cave-troll-kd.jpg]

I guess its just a different type of great cave-troll, there would be a handful of different ones I'm sure just as there were differing types of Orcs as well. Really like the art on Orc-Chieftain as well even though its very different and his shield is just 3 wooden planks stuck together :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

Ok thanks. Is quite interesting. So if you deal him 1 damage he will not suffer at all. So with toughness 1 you must to deal him at least 2 damage to make him suffer 1 damage. Actually is work almost same as defense. Hmmm… ok anyway something new

it's not like defense for direct damage though - any amount of damage - either direct or through combat - is reduced by Toughness X.

I hoped they would get around to this eventually.  "Toughness" is a nice solution to the silly power creep that has half-naked Dunlendings with 3 defense.  It messes with direct damage decks, it makes enemies challenging and it doesn't put insane numbers on the card that break with theme.  I suggested the same effect for a blog contest last year, but called it "Warded."

I find myself strangely ambivalent about this box.  I don't know if it's because of all the delays or if, more likely, that I won't be able to put the entire fellowship in my deck as allies.  One of the reasons I love The Black Riders so much was that it seemed like I could play it as close to the story as I wanted even as a solo player.  (Of course I didn't get an Aragorn ally.)  I know the boxes have card limits but...

## 80 [Gizlivadi on October 3, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/123682-road-darkens-cards-on-cardgamedb/?do=findComment&comment=1286462)

What I find most disappointing of the box is the low number of player cards. 8? only 8? Really? It's worse than an AP, and even the AP that would introduce Gandalf would have Narya in it. I stand by my opinion that they should increase the number of player cards we get in each product, or else it feels like the encounter cards are awesome and have a lot of depth while we only get a couple player cards and it really doesn't do justice to the book IMO.

## 81 [Teamjimby on October 3, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/123682-road-darkens-cards-on-cardgamedb/?do=findComment&comment=1286470)

Agreed.  I was SUPER excited about this box for a long time, but the player cards are pretty disappointing.  Only 1 new hero and he breaks the game so I'll probably only play him once and be done.  They wasted too many player card slots on Gandalf attachments and boons.  The only player card from the whole box that I expect I'll use often is Bilbo.  We'll see how useful the one-and-done allies are.  Boromir ally could be good in a secrecy deck, but that's only if nobody else is running a Boromir hero.

 

However, I'm still really excited about the encounters and continuing campaign mode.  They look to be very challenging and very well done.

I guess it would have been hard to include ally versions of each of the fellowship members.  So there is that, and I am glad that we got Gandalf.  I may not use him outside of this environment, but I hope it will be fun to play him.

 

Just picked up my box and now I have to build a deck.

Here's something I missed:  We can use Frodo from The Black Riders as our Ringbearer instead of the Frodo from this box if we wish.  I probably won't, but I think it's cool that we can.

 

On the other hand, I dimly remember that changing hero's would incur a penalty, but that didn't matter to me during the first box and now it does...

Yes, I have thought about that as well.  You can't really do a thematic playthrough without changing your heroes here and there, and that's going to hurt with threat raises.  But maybe after the breaking of the fellowship we'll have some special rules that accommodate for this?

Expert Treasure-Hunter + Hidden Cache + Wizard Pipe could be a killer combo - a sort of Steward of Gondor for Gandalf, so that he always has resources to spare - and can play the next card in the deck every phase! I want to pair him with Elrond so Vilya can pull its weight as well, but putting the two highest-threat heroes in the game in the same deck feels like a bad idea.

You could make a Three Elven Rings of Power deck. (only Gandalf doesn't have his precious yet..) Galadriel can keep your threat at 0 raise, but you would have to include a lot of threatreduc, (starting threat of 36!) mulligan for elrond's counsil etc.

At least I'm going to try that. Sure it's going to be powerfull.

I want try made deck Gandalf / Glorfindel (Spirit), Aragorn (Leadership).

 

At the beginning of the quest "The Ring Goes South" in Campaign Mode I can chooses one Boon card: Sting, Mithril Shirt (for Frodo), Glamdring (Gandalf) or Andruil (Aragorn) and adds it to my hand. Remains unchosen Boon cards I shuffle into my deck.

 

In deck I want put:

 

Bilbo Baggins - to get Wizard Pipe.

Galadriel + Sneak Attack - to get unchosen Boon cards, Gandalf's Staff, Light Of Valinor, Steward Of Gondor, Celebrians Stone, Unexpected Courage, Sword That Was Broken.

Arwen, Flame Of Arnor, Elronds Counsel,The Galadhrims Greeting.

Hall of Beorn now has ALL text AND visual spoilers for the entire road darkens boxset!!

(sorry to steal your thunder Beorn but I'm too excited!)

Have just looked over them all for a solid half hour or so and am very impressed and excited to receive my copy.

All three quests have absolutely fantastic art on both the quest and encounter cards and all three look to be both challenging and thematic. I might have to go back and replay black riders and get as few burdens as possible and choose/place boons a bit better so that these quests are a little easier/doable!

I'm sure there will be lots of discussion about each quest in particular and the various encounter cards so I won't rave on about anything in particular just yet but thank you so much Beorn for the spoilers and everyone else if you have not seen them yet do so now!!

As usual, fans of the game are doing a better job at updating galleries and card searches than the actual official websites. The art on this expansion looks great, I'd say even better than usual, especially the Argonath, I'd been waiting for so long to finally see it represented in this game. My only problem is, why do the Doors of Durin look vastly different to how they were represented in the book?

Since on my one hand campaign I am about to enter Moria, I have a question regarding Balrogs ability

 

He is immune to player cards (so no feint etc), but his shadow cards are also immune. Does this mean that even if I have Burning Brand, it des not work on Balrogs shadow cards? I guess so but want to be sure

That's right, he's unstoppable!

I'm discouraged from getting this saga box, considering my tight budget.  Only 1 hero and only 7 player cards, as compared to getting 2 APs for the same price ( 2 heroes and 18+ player cards) or compared to other previous saga boxes with 4 heroes or newer once, with 2 heroes.  The quests may be great, but from player card point of view, I don't know if I'll get a good value.

Honestly, I'm not really a huge fan of this box. Some people love the Gandalf hero, but I find him both too fiddly and too powerful (he kind of takes over the deck design, he has a lot of toys).

The quests are okay -- it's fun to try to escape the Balrog -- but honestly your intuition is probably right if player cards are your thing.

But the next Saga box is fantastic from a player card perspective -- it suddenly opens up a myriad of options for Rohan decks. If skipping this box is going to make you want to skip out on the next one, it might be worth it to bite the bullet, because Campaign Mode is one of the most fun ways to play this game.

I'm not a fan either of this box as I don't (and won't probably ever) play Gandalf hero and his toys. The unique allies are good but expendable (except maybe for Galadriel which I find amazing to play).

 

I'd say though that the quests are absolutely amazing in capturing that part of the books (well, actually, all LOTR Sagas are up to that point) and as said above, Campaign Mode is one of the best ways to play this game.

Right there with you in regards to Gandalf. He totally takes over your deck design, has way too many toys (and will unfortunately get another with Narya!) and is both overpowered and too fiddly. I think I played two games with him and decided he was definitely not for me. 

The quests in both boxes are epic but the player cards in Treason of Saruman are definitely a lot more varied and useful. If you aren't planning on using the Gandalf hero many of the player cards in Road Darkens are useless. Galadriel, Elrond and Boromir ally are all pretty nice however, especially Galadriel who has become a staple in my decks.

On the other hand I like to use him with Hobbits. I agree he seems overpowered but in order for this to happen you need Wizard Pipe and his stuff, till you get them there are occations that you will not be able to use his abilities. Also In decks other than with Hobbit heroes the starting threat could be very high.

I enjoyed the heck out the box, but not until we got the Gimli and Legolas allies. When I finally beat Moria with all of the fellowship on the table and then took out the Balrog it was really satisfying.

I have a question regarding this location

 

 

Many-pillared-Hall.jpg [https://s3.amazonaws.com/hallofbeorn-resources/Images/Cards/The-Road-Darkens/Many-pillared-Hall.jpg]

 

 

If I understand correct, if it is alonw in the staging area it's threat is 2 , am I right ? (1 for the card threat + 1 for it is the only copy of Many Pillard Hall). If there are two, each of them has a threat of 3 (1 for the card +2 because there are two such locations)

 

Is this so?

Yes.

> As usual, fans of the game are doing a better job at updating galleries and card searches than the actual official websites. The art on this expansion looks great, I'd say even better than usual, especially the Argonath, I'd been waiting for so long to finally see it represented in this game. My only problem is, why do the Doors of Durin look vastly different to how they were represented in the book?

I think many people aren't aware that cardgamedb is now owned by ffg and it's how they release the card sets to the public.

I am aware of that, that's why I said it. Hallofbeorn had the spoilers before Cardgamedb.
