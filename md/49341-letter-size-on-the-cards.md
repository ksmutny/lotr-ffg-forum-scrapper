I find the letter size on the cards to be smaller than either Warhammer or Game of Thrones.  Are there plans to increase the letter size in future expansions?

To make sure that the game continues to present a challenge to the players, as expansions are released, the text will actually become smaller and smaller, becoming ever more difficult to read in order for the players to win the game. lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif]

In all seriousness though, to the best of my knowledge, FFG has never made any comments about the font size of the cards, so I doubt it will change.

 Yup.

 

I knew my eyes SUDDENLY got worse this year (I'm 45) but this is the first game that I have actually not been able to read.  Very frustrating from a gaming and personal stand point :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

I'm somewhat relieved to hear I'm not the only one having trouble reading the card text. The greatest challenge are the names of the artists - what font size is this? 0.5?
