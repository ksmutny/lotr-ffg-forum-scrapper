What does the word "spend" really mean. If i discard or move a resource from a hero, can i still use this card in order to get one resource?

I think moving or discarding doesn't count as spending. Â When you pay for a card from hand, that's obviously spending, and also if you use a card effect that specifically says "spend" (e.g. LeAragorn spends a resource to ready after committing to the quest).
