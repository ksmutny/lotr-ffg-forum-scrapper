 So, just recently I have been playing more of the new scenarios and realized there is something I don't know.  Let's say I just won a quest phase by enough to switch the Quest Card to the next stage; Do I immediately flip the second card to "side B?" (this is how I have been playing it).  To add to the question further; Let's say I immediately flip the new Quest Card to "side B" and the Quest Card then has a "when revealed" caption.  Do I immediately resolve that Quest Card's "When Revealed" action?  Hopefully this doesn't seem like too silly of a QUESTion (sorry, I couldn't resist the pun). :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 You do reveal if you flip a card.

Technically, you are supposed to process any text on side A before immediately proceeding to side B (although no Stage 2, 3, or 4 cards have anything other than flavor text on their respective A sides). When you flip the new quest card to side B, any "when revealed" effects resolve immediately. The only exceptions to this rule are the quest cards in Flight From Moria, which are not flipped over until the staging step during the NEXT round.

All of this takes place during the quest phase, so a character like Thalin will still damage any enemies revealed via quest card effects.

 So do Dol Guldur Orcs deal their damage if they are revealed during the movement from (X)B quest card to (X+1)B quest card?

 Ehm, from (X)B to (X+1)A, obviously

 I don´t understand the question exactly I am afraid. 

If the Orcs are revealed somewhere in the quest phase they deal damage. Characters are considered "questing" from the point where they commit to the quest until the end of the quest phase.

 Well, usually the act of changing stage (from 2B to 3A, for example) happens during quest phase, after resolving the quest, deciding how many progress tokens you have to put on quest card and completing it. Sometimes this change happens during combat phase (for instance if you are using Legolas, Blade or Gondolin or if you remove an enemy blocking the way - like the Troll in the Journey down the Anduin quest).

If the stage change happens at the end of quest phase, while you are putting progress tokens, are you still considering questing? Are your characters still committed to a quest? What about some enemy like Dol Guldur Orcs [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/core/dol-guldur-orcs-core] reveal as a consequence of the new quest card? Do their "When revealed" effect apply?

 If you haven't started the Travel phase yet, your questing characters are still committed to the quest.

 So if you change quests cards during say, combat (ie Legolas effect), Dol Guldur Orcs revealed as a result will do no damage as no one is committed to the quest any more.

So Thalin does hit everything the next quest card may bring if he was committed that phase. cool :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Correct.
