i know that some things say 'printed ranged/resource icon' or something like that, but what about 'good meal'?

if you have a song card on does that count towards the sphere match?

im sure this has been addressed by cant find the clarification

thanks

Hmm good question.  Here's my take… 

pg. 8, manual, the text describing Aragorn's Leadership icon: "9. Resource Icons: Found only on hero cards, these icons indicate the sphere(s) of influence to which resource tokens in this hero’s resource pool belong. They also indicate to which sphere(s) the hero card itself belongs."

and pg. 4, "spheres of influence": "There are four different spheres of influence in The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game, and each has its own distinct flavor and identity. Most player cards fall under one of these spheres, represented by a unique icon, as well as by a unique color on its card border. Each hero has an emphasis in one of these four spheres. A hero’s sphere dictates the types of cards that hero allows a player to use."

My take - the "sphere resource icon" and the "sphere to which a hero belongs" are different things (via my emphasis in the above passage).  A Song only gives a resource icon, so Good Meal wouldn't work if the icon is granted via a Song.  The Song's text explicitly states that the hero only gains a resource icon -- not that the hero now belongs to sphere X.

i sent a rules request and it turns out its the opposite

Hi Richard,
That's a good question. Since the resource icon indicates which sphere a hero belongs to, if a hero gains an additional resource icon from a card effect, then the hero will belong to that sphere as well. That will allow you to combo cards like Good Meal with the song cards.
Cheers,
Caleb
