My staging area has a total threat of 9pts (ALL LOCATIONS!).

My 3 hero's equal a willpower of 5. The only characters that count toward my willpower total are the ones I commit to a quest.

Here is where the circle turns...I have to add Encounter cards to the staging area for each hero I commit to the quest. As you can see, this only adds to the Threat Level. Not sure how to move forward. Adding more Ally's just means more encounter cards.

Sounds like you're playing a tactics deck. To avoid situations like these, travel to locations once they're revealed. Try to use Spirit and Leadership heroes. Bungo already mentioned two of their awesome allies (Lórien Guide isn't too bad either), but these spheres have also attachments that can raise the WP of your heroes. Leadership also has Faramir (quest monster ) and Sneak attack, which you can use to play Gandalf to use his 4 WP during the quest phase for only one resource. Last but not least, Leadership has Steward of Gondor, which provides you with enough resources to play more than one ally each round.

Or you try Lore which has Protector of Lorien, the most powerful card for questing.

Oh, and not every encounter card adds points to the total threat. In your situation you must hope for some harmless treacheries.

You only add 1 encounter card PER PLAYER during the Quest Phase. There are effects that make you add more but the main rule is 1 encounter card per player. Not per hero or per character committed to the quest.
