# [Nightmare Decks Decklist Please?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/91716-nightmare-decks-decklist-please/)

Hi there,

 

I've just aquired my Nightmare Decks, all 3 quests, but the order came opened so I want to make sure I am not missing any cards from each quest.

 

Does someone have a decklist for each quest so I can confirm all cards are there? If not, can someone be so kind to type it?

 

I know it's a pain but I would be extremely thankful.

 

Javier

There should  be 20 cards for each quest. If you have 20 for each quest you ok.
