I'm posting this here for the people that aren't on BoardGameGeek.  One of the former regulars on these boards, Tracker1, started a duplicate tournament format where the player and encounter decks are arranged in a fixed order.  Everyone plays the same quest and sees the same cards, yet the results can be wildly different.

 

If this interests you, there is currently a tournament running for the Seventh Level that uses Legolas, Glorfindel, and Elrond.  The decks are listed in order (in spoilers, just click to reveal the cards) on the second page of the thread.  Check it out: https://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/1481329/lotr-lcg-duplicate-tournament-5-seventh-level [https://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/1481329/lotr-lcg-duplicate-tournament-5-seventh-level]
