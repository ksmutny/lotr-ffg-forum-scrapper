Yes.

Glorfindel's effect is indeed a "card effect," so he will be removed from the game if he heals Wilyador during Stage 2B. Probably best to avoid doing so unless you're in really dire straits. 

For scoring purposes, he would be considered "dead" at the end of the game (i.e. you would add his 12 threat to your total).

NO you wrong. If you remove Glorifindel from the game his threat level will be not count for final score cose he is not in discard pile. Only heroes in discard pile counts.

 Nate has ruled in the past that a hero that was used, but is no longer in the game, should be counted as "dead" for scoring purposes.

Also thought I shoud point out, that dead Heroes do in fact go to their owner's dicard pile. If this wasn't so, Fortune or Fate for example wouldn't work.

I see that if Glorfindel is used to heal Wilyador, he is discarded -- but what about using resource tokens from Radagast for healing the wounded Eagle? -- would Radagast also be discarded if used in this way?

just to be clear, it's removed from the game entirely, not just discarded.

also, yes, but i'm curious why you are asking the question. what about Radagast makes you think that it could be treated differently?

Thanks for the reply, dr00 -- I was unsure about Radagast since he came in the card pool for this quest and seemed like he was designed to be used to heal WIlyador.  Maybe the only way to do this effeciently would be to get Radagast in play very early and let him build up a large pool of resource tokens - then use them all at once for healing Wilydor before removing Radagast entirely?

That won't work, he will be discarded after the first heal.

What is possible is to get read of the location before the second quest.

Yeah, but the first heal could be for 5. Radagast isn't pay 1 to heal 1, he's pay X to heal X.

 

So yes, that can work if you manage to pull it off. If the game somehow drags on long enough you could even play a second copy of Radagast and do it again.

I stand corrected... never thought it was an X.

This quest definitely benefits from adding in some one-off healing. I recommend The Long Defeat, as one of the more generally playable cards that also works well here.

I don't think The Long Defeat works here, unless you are also clearing Rhosgobel with progress placement like Asfaloth or something before you complete the first stage.  Since you have to complete Stage 1 in order to travel to Rhosgobel, Rhosgobel would prevent you from healing.  You can still draw cards, of course.

 

Then, when you advance from stage 2 to stage 3, the effect on stage 3 will resolve (causing you to win or lose) before The Long Defeat's effect can trigger.

 

I am assuming that cards like The Long Defeat resolve similarly to cards like Ancient Mathom even though one triggers after the location is explored and one triggers after a quest is completed.

All very reasonable points cmabr002. Indeed I agree Long defeat is useless to place on this particular quest stage, though it was handy when I played this adventure. I believe we did in fact clear Rhsogobel direct, with Asfaloth.

However, putting that aside, in my group we almost always play Long Defeat onto side quests, which remains valid even during stage two here.

However, I concede your point. Even if it worked well for me and is generally decent, it is likely not the best recommendation for this adventure.
