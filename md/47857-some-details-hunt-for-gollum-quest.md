Hey Fellows. If you look first tutorial video you can see the First stage card of the Hunt for Gollum quest.




on 1.26. minute.

So name of the first stage is Hunt Begin have 8 progress token icon.

Forced: every time when players quest unsuccessefully, The first player look at the 3 top cards of encounter deck.Reveal and add 1 of those card to the staging area and discard other 2 cards.

Looks like is same difficult as a River quest from Core set and i like it.

Good spot. Its actually if the players quest succesfully.  Interesting that the other cards are discarded.  You could use it to get rid of some nasty cards.

Yes maybe my eyes is not so good. This word is worst part of the pictures to understand.

If you sure ok. But is weird than!!!  You succesfully questing + you can discard a nasty card.Good bonus!!! But anyway you have additional card almost every turn and get it before engagement. But sounds promising anyway.

When we will get this pack in our hand???In the end of June i hope?

Well the point is that we can search for the Clues that Gollum is leaving around. I'm liking that mechanic, and the picture on the card is great! (Aragorn I think, hunting for Gollum). Looking forward to the preview on Friday!
