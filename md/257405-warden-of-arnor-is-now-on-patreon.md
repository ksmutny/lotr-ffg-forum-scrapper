Warden of Arnor is looking for Patreon support! While I write the blog for my love of the game, the more I put into it the more it starts feeling like a (highly enjoyable) part-time job; and man cannot live (or afford better video editing software) by cards alone! As such, any contributions from members of the community who enjoy what I do would be greatly appreciated. I'm also still trying to think of more patron rewards I could offer, so I'd welcome any suggestions on that front!

If I weren't in between jobs at the moment...

Totally fair. Make sure you have enough money for yourself before giving any to me.
