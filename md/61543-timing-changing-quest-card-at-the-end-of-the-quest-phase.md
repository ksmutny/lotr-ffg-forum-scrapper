# [Timing - Changing Quest card at the end of the Quest phase](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61543-timing-changing-quest-card-at-the-end-of-the-quest-phase/)

## 1 [The_Fallen_Arises on March 7, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61543-timing-changing-quest-card-at-the-end-of-the-quest-phase/?do=findComment&comment=603250)

 Rather simple question, so forgive me for asking...

 

Suppose I have just quested with Eowyn and Thalin on Quest X. I resolve the staging step, tally up my willpower, and quest successfully. I then put progress tokens on the quest, sufficiently to complete this stage of the quest. In accordance with the rules, I immediately ignore the excess progress and resolve any effects on the new Quest card.

 

Here's the question :

 

If the new quest card forces me to draw new encounter cards, are my characters still considered committed to the quest ? Or did they stop being comitted to the quest as soon as the progress tokens were placed during quest resolution ?

 

For example, if the new Quest card reveals Enemies from the Encounter deck, does Thalin's ability apply (1 dmg to enemies revealed from the encounter deck while he's committed to the quest) ? Would a Treachery card's effect affecting characters ''commited to the quest'' apply ?

 

Thanks in advance for the answer !

 Your characters remain committed to the quest until the end of the Quest Phase.

 I will take it as a yes, the effects would apply and they are still committed (unless I read you wrong).

 

Thanks Radiskull !

 

P.S. Joe Sparks's stuff was awesome ! ;-)

Lol! Me too, even though I know it's probably not true. I sure don't look like my avatar! 

Anyway, I agree that it's still part of the quest phase because there was no window of time in which the phase could have changed. Everything you described was in response to questing successfully, so until those responses are through, it seems you can't declare that the questing phase is over. Another interpretation is that the quest phase doesn't end until the travel phase begins, and since you haven't had an opportunity to travel in the time when cards are being revealed, it's still part of the quest phase.

 Thanks to everyone. I was always bugged by that little thing and now I will quest with a clean conscience.

 

I kinda wish Joe Sparks would have finished this whole story about Devildoll's angel girlfriend going to Hell. Sure, today the animation seems dated, but I just loved the songs (and Radiskull).

 

Kinda reminds me of Homestar Runner...place hasn't been updated in forever...sad.

 

But alas ! I am off-topic. Thanks again for the answers ! See you on the boards :-)

No, Thailns ability only effects card that are revealed while questing.

"While Thalin is committed to a quest, deal 1 damage to each enemy as it is revealed by the encounter deck.

 

What this means is that as soon as you calculate the threat and place tokens, anything else reveals, like say form a quest card effect, or anything in any other phase.. will not get a dmg point.

So to trigger a quest card effect you need to place the tokens on it.. then cads get revealed.. but this is AFTER the card uncommitted.. As they uncommitted during the calculation and placement of the token.

So short answer is .. unless the card is revealed during teh questing (1 per player) or though a surge effect during that time Thanlins ability dose not count.

Once committed, Thalin is questing through the entire quest phase. Second, the key for Thalin is revealed. Just as long as it is the quest phase and a card is revealed (and from the Encounter deck), it falls under Thalin's ability. Add it to the staging area doesn't trigger.

"Characters committed to a quest are considered
committed to that quest through the end of the quest
phase, unless removed from the quest by a card effect." (p. 14)

Where are you getting the uncommitted stuff from? Until you get to the Travel phase, questers are questing.

questing and questing phase are different game states.... as soon as you place the token the quest is over.. Thalin only effects card revealed during questing, not at any other time.

Ok, I may have to disagree with you on this.

The rules state : 'Characters committed to a quest are considered committed to that quest through the end of the quest phase, unless removed from the quest by a card effect.' (Core Set rules, p14)

Also, 'Quest Advancement', p22 : 'Players immediately advance to the next stage of a
quest as soon as they place a number of progress tokens
equal to or greater than the number of quest points
the current quest card has. (...)
Players follow any instructions on the newly revealed
quest card as it is revealed.'

and '(...) the round
sequence is not interrupted.'

So, if we follow the rules by the letter, I'll play like this :

=> Quest Phase, beginning

(...)

=> Quest Phase, stage 3 (Resolution), beginning

 * Putting enough progress tokens
 * Game immediate standby caused by Quest Card advancement (we're still in the Resolution stage, Quest phase)
 * Revealing new ennemies and treachery as next Quest Card instructions (still in Resolution stage, Quest phase)
 * End of new Quest Card instructions, resuming play sequence

=> Quest Phase, stage 3, end

=> Quest phase, end

 

Note that Thalin's effect states 'While Thalin is committed to a quest', and that during the Quest Card resolution, we're still in the quest phase. So the enemies revealed by the Quest Card instructions are dealt one damage token. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Care you find a rule quote for "placing tokens ends quest"?

Whole point of Thalin is:

"While Thalin is committed to a quest..."

not questing, but committed, which, once committed, he is until the end of the quest phase (unless removed from quest by card effect). He isn't committed to one stage of the quest card, if you complete say 1B and flip to 2B, he is still committed because we're still in the quest phase.

Now, quickly going over the quest cards so far, I think HFG's 1B is the only one I could think of where it matters. Quest successfully and you trigger the Forced:

"Forced: After the players quest successfully, the first player looks at the top 3 cards of the encounter deck. Reveal and add 1 of those cards to the staging area, and discard the other 2 cards."

Since HFG (IIRC) has Eastern Crows in the Encounter deck, Thalin could reveal and add them, then kill them right away. A really lucky draw would be to reveal a Clue, then reveal EC as guardian for it, zapping them with Thalin. Also last stage in Journey Down the Anduin the quest card reveals from the Encounter deck.

Rulewise booored might be wrong, but it bugs me that he (Thalin, not booored) s still committed to a quest when the quest he was committed to is already DUN. At the point when the next stage is revealed he should already have his second breakfast which he stole from Bilbo instead of stil being on the watch for enemies.

while it may seem off - think of it  that all other characters follow the same rule- everyone commited is considerd to be commited, no matter what type of character they are

 Well...I understand leptokurt's point...It's the proper way to play it in accordance with the rules, but I always felt like cheating when I used his effect this way. :-p

 Bear in mind that if your characters ceased to be committed to the quest when the new quest flipped, then a treachery card that targets characters committed to the ques would have no effect. Considering the fact that the encounter deck tends to be brutal, I would guess that the desingers intend for those treachery cards to still work. When I step back and consider how many times this situation might come up without Thalin present in a game, then I don't feel bad letting Thalin's ability work on cards revealed by the new quest card. Besides, as has been mentioned before, there are relatively few scenarios that reveal new cards when you advance to a new stage.

 My conscience thanks you, good sir. I no longer feel guilty for applying this rule ;-)
