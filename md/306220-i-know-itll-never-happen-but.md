Imagine for the end of this iteration of the game, they release an art album of a sampling of some of the gorgeous artwork from the game. It would have to be limited edition, but I could easily justify paying $80 - $100 for a collection of the gorgeous artwork that has come out for this game. Off of the top of my head I love Shrouded Hills from The Lost Realm and Heed the Dream from Flight of the Stormcaller. Would anyone else be interested in this? What are some of your favorite pieces of art in the game?

At the risk of sounding like the sellout that I am I do have to say that the limited collector's edition starter set was packed with extended art cards. The heroes, the allies, events, attachments, even the encounter cards. They stand out and there is something gorgeous about them.

If they re-issued more packs/expansions for the game with the cards made like that I would have a hard time not buying them.

It is really hard to choose favorite art in this game, there are so many cards I absolutely love and I have gushed over the art of multiple cards multiple times. For the sake of not writing a book or listing almost every card I'll limit my picks to my current deck and the most recent deluxe expansion.

A Shadow in the East - Ally Pippin, Khamul the Easterling, The One Ring.

In my deck - Ally Quickbeam, Saruman's Staff. Saruman, Leaflock. Actually almost all the Ent art for that matter. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] 

Suffice to say the art has steadfast been one of my absolute favorite things about this great game.

I think this would be a great idea! A nice giant 600+ page art book featuring full page artwork.

My favorite has always been Secret Paths from the core set. I love a lot the art from the locations as well, my favorite there being the combined artwork from the unique "Road" location cards from The Blood of Gondor.

...it took me until now to realise this.

You can purchase a number of Lotr Lcg prints from Magali Villeneuve and frame it.  She has a website.  I purchased a few from her and shipping and everything was great.

I have a framed Mithlond Sea-watcher and a framed Gaining Strength. They look wonderful on my wall. I would personally love an artbook of the game, as I have used several pieces of art for banners and thumbnails for articles for my blog.

As a whole, I'm not overly impressed by Magali's work, but I'll take a look.

I have long felt like FFG was leaving money on the table by not working with a printing company to release large coffee table books of their artwork, distributed at book sellers and box stores.  But I suspect either they've run the numbers on this and coffee table books just don't sell like they used to OR their rights to the images may not allow for such distribution.

But between Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, and Game of Thrones FFG has commissioned and compiled some truly impressive art archives of some mega popular and beloved franchises.



As for my own favorite art in this game, there are so many pieces to love.  Anything by Magali Villeneuve I find to be pretty stunning, but I also really appreciate the art from "Will of West" by Erfian Asafat, as it captures the feeling of such an excellent moment of hard-fought Gondorian victory on the battlefield.

I would also jump on that. I wanted to pick up the collectors edition just for the extra art but shipping to Canada is insane so I'll wait to see if there's still any left next time I'm at the FFG Game Center.

But I love anything by Magali as well, maybe why my favourite heroes in the game are Legolas and Eleanor (and why I like running those two with a Spirit Glorfindel!)
