# [Compilation of Resources (Available Now!)](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52157-compilation-of-resources-available-now/)

Update: It's still a work in progress, but I put up the page here: tabletopgeeks.com/living-card-game-resources/ [http://tabletopgeeks.com/living-card-game-resources/]


When I get into a game I have this habit of wanting to find every single resource I can for that game. Since I started my website, Tabletop Geeks [http://tabletopgeeks.com], I have been putting everything I find onto a page so that I not only have it saved but so that other people can benefit from my collection as well (example: Malifaux Downloads [http://tabletopgeeks.com/malifaux-downloads/] page). Now that I'm really getting into these Living Card Games I'd like to put up a page like this for LCGs as well.


So, I ask that you guys post any resources that you know of for LotR LCG here so that I can compile them all into one location. I am looking for any documents/pdfs/web resources/whatever that you find useful. Once I get a good list of stuff I'll put up a page with all the links in one location.

There is a rule summary on www.headlesshollow.com/downloads/games/LordoftheRingsLCG_v1.pdf [http://www.headlesshollow.com/downloads/games/LordoftheRingsLCG_v1.pdf] with a printable turn sequence overview.

I made a Strange Eons plugin with which you can create your own encounter cards, on www.4shared.com/file/_VH6sOk6/LotR.html [http://www.4shared.com/file/_VH6sOk6/LotR.html] The Strange Eons program is required for it. It's been originally developed to create custom cards for Arkham Horror, and is downloadable here: cgjennings.ca/eons/download/update.html [http://cgjennings.ca/eons/download/update.html]

Finally, there is a sheet with card separators for your collection box, but I think only in German: www.boardgamegeek.com/file/download/7ysfiqxybf/Kartentrenner_V2.2.pdf [http://www.boardgamegeek.com/file/download/7ysfiqxybf/Kartentrenner_V2.2.pdf]

Greetings,

Hilarious Pete

Thanks! This is the stuff I'm looking for. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Would you mind if I were to host your Strange Eons plugin on my site so people don't have to go through 4shared?

## 4 [HilariousPete on August 26, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52157-compilation-of-resources-available-now/?do=findComment&comment=520279)

Yes, that would be great, thanks!

Okay, I've put up the start of this on the site now. Check it out and let me know what you think so far.

tabletopgeeks.com/living-card-game-resources/ [http://tabletopgeeks.com/living-card-game-resources/]

Also, definitely still looking for more stuff to put up.

Still looking for more resources! Anyone else know of anything?

## 8 [Svenn on August 29, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52157-compilation-of-resources-available-now/?do=findComment&comment=521572)

Added some new stuff and also put Warhammer: Invasion in there. This is coming along nicely I think. Anyone have any thoughts? More links/downloads?

I just discovered OCTGN and found the Warhammer Invasion files for this. Does anyone know if there are files for the Lord of the Rings Card Game? I have a friend that I play with who lives far away, and this seems like a great way for us to play when we can't actually get together.

Found em! Links are up on the resources page now. You can use OCTGN to play over the internet! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I just wanted to bump this because I've been slowly adding more to this over the past few weeks. I'm always looking or more though, so if you have anything that might be useful to other players let me know!

## 12 [Svenn on November 2, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52157-compilation-of-resources-available-now/?do=findComment&comment=550819)

I put up links to the new FAQ and updated score sheet. I decided to add a "New Releases" section as well since, from personal experience, keeping up with what's released in multiple LCGs can be... disorienting. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] I'll try and keep it updated with the latest release as soon as they are available.

Also, always looking for more resources!

how about this one:

www.thefellowshipofthecards.com

It's a great podcast that delves into the history/mythology behind the cards. I thinks its awesome :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
