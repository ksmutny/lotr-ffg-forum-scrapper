When Ranger Spikes is attached to an enemy, do you still have to do Archery, Prowl, etc.?  My take is that the enemy is spiked or trapped and wouldn't be able to do anything of those things.  My son says we still have to follow those even though the enemy is trapped.  Any help of this would be greatly appreciated.

You still have to resolve any keywords like Surge, Archery, etc.  Maybe a point where you have to separate rules from theme.. yeah they're stuck in spikes, but they're stlil gonna fire some arrows and steal your money.

Really impressed by how quickly and clearly you always help newcomers Grandspleen, pretty sure you helped me a couple of times when I first joined the forums and had questions =)
