Can someone confirm that the adventure pack only comes with two quest cards.

 

Just want to make sure I'm not missing anything

 

Thanks

I know it's just a typo, but as a guy who invested too much time in reading Star Wars novels, I couldn't stop myself chuckling over the idea of a bunch of trolls roaming through one of these [http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Carrack_cruiser]...

Hahaha. You DO read too many Star Wars novels. I thought I was bad and I didn't catch that at all :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

that brings me back to a starwars PC game i had over a decade ago.....carracks were the  worst ships you could build- they just got annihilated :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]....they couldnt even take on those little cruisers of the rebel alliance (sorry, im not a star wars fan anymore so haven no idea what theyre called)

A Carrack is a age of Sail ship used to explore the New World if I recall.

 

This is the Car_rock_

 

Big Rock in Sindarin or some such most likely, Tolkiens names of places actually mean something. 

 

He really shows up most later fantasy writers as derivative hacks IMHO

Tolkien was a Linguistics professor wasn't he? It shows.

i believe car means rock....so it is basically rock-rock ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

there are several carrocks around northern england where i live (its a very mountainous area so makes sense)

Star Wars Rebellion [http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Star_Wars:_Rebellion_%28video_game%29]? One of the best games ever xD
