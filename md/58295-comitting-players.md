hi all, when committing to a quest:; do you commit all or just one character, and is it a good idea to have gandalf as a starter hero? im playing solo and am wondering do i have to have all heroes of same sphere or can i mix, what should my deck consist of; all the core set or just the sphere of influence of my heroes?  thanks in advance for any clarification.

hi

-you can commit as many as you like, however remember that if you commit none, the quest phase still happens and you count your willpower as 0

-gandalf is an ally, not a hero, and must be bought using resources

-beginners deck are usually 1 sphere, all cards from the core set in that sphere, 1 copy of gandalf, and 3 heros that belong to that chosen sphere, after you get better youll want to start mixing and creating multi sphere decks that have to have at least 50 cards, 3 heros, and no more than 3 copies of each card
