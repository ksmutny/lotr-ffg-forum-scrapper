I'm thinking why each trait has a particular way to play and if it is made by an specific sense, for example:

 

Dwarfs: its trait is to increase power exclusive between therselves, when they are a lot --> sense: they are a closed folk, when they are together, they are strong.

 

Silvans: its trait is to increase power when they enter and leave play --> sense: they jump between trees, killing orcs with their weapons (arrows, etc)

 

Hobbits: its trait is to hide from enemy keeping secrecy and low threat --> sense: they are little, they are .... hobbits.

 

Rohan: its trait is to mount horses, and rush very powerful when they are claimed --> sense: they are made for riding, very strong in puntual moments.

 

Gondor: its trait is to increase power when they are a lot --> sense: they are a big city

 

Noldor: its trait is to increase power when they use discard pile --> sense: they like the glorious elven past

 

Dunedain: its trait is to increase power when they are engaged with enemies --> sense: their life is used to clean the earth of the enemies, specially from the north

 

Ranger: its trait is to spy and ambush enemies in staging --> sense: they are in the forest ready to ambush the enemy

 

 

Is it true? Or it is me? ^^ Specially about Dunedain trait, what do you think? Any different idea in some trait?

Have you confused Gondor with Outlands?

I'd say Gondor tries to leverage wealth (Blood of Numenor, Gondorian Fire, Leadership Boromir, Visionary Leadership).

Gondor has the highest number of high quality defensive bonuses, because they were the wall against Mordor.

Rohan has tons of abilities that trigger off discard, because they were so desperate in their selfless fight against Isengard.

Dwarves discard cards off the top of the deck to represent their skill at mining.

 

Ents come into play exhausted because they are slow to action.

 

Noldor discard cards to represent the elves heading into the West during the third age, though some of them (Glorfindel) come back.

 

 

 

It's interesting that the discard pile is used to represent a few different things thematically. Zigil Miner isn't killing the cards discarded by his ability...

> Have you confused Gondor with Outlands?

 

Both traits do this, which I suppose is a nice thing for a thematic pairing.

 

Gondor has a bunch of global boosts, with Faramir (Gondor ally but the boost is not Gondor-restricted), Visionary Leadership, and the Leadership Boromir hero.  I was playing Helm's Deep with Teamjimby the other day and he was questing for 60 with an Erestor-Imrahil-Boromir deck.

Lately Gondor also benefit from having an high threat, which make sense since Mordor is so close.

Nope. One tactics ally and one leadship ally do not warrant for this kind of statement.

 

Quite the opposite, we have some stuff that relies on you having threat lower than your enemie's engagement cost. That's all just parts of other themes that got something to do with Gondor as a side effect, those have nothing to do with the Gondor itself.

That's why I said "lately"...incidentally the only allies with a valour power (honour guard) has a Gondor trait. Plus the other valour events that works with Beregond and others big defender as Defender of Rammas

Mind pointing me what exact Valour event works with the Defender of Rammas? :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Hold Your Ground

My bad, I thought that hour of wrath worked also for ally. That leaves only rallying cry, but I admit is a bit weak

No, hold your ground requires sentinel.

Oh. Well.

Well, rallying cry is all-rounder, it has no relation to any trait or anything. If anything, it helps guys with lesser defense, not with the higher one. 

 

Anyways, anybody remembers if there is any valour stuff spoiled from the dreamchaser cycle? I wonder if valour is going to be dumped off just like the Doomed was.

According to FFG, Silvan popped in and out because, as a race, they rarely helped out, and when they did, they'd show up, do some awesome stuff and then leave. I believe that's how it was.

I would expect to see a marriage of the Gondor trait and the valour ability going forward. I think the allies honour guard and veteran of Osgiliath have begun this trend. Some of the valour events have Gondorian themed artwork too. Only time will tell, but it makes sense.
