Got in a disagreement with my gf while we playing the carrock last night. I said that after Grimbeorn has 8 tokens on him, he changes control every round, going under the control of the first player. My gf seemed to think that after he was paid off, he goes to the first player, and then stays with that player for the remainder of the game.

 

My logic is that the trigger is read at all times... so if a grimbeorn loses his tokens, he would go back to the staging area, and if the first player changes, his controller changes.

 

Heres is that the trigger happens once, and thats that. I don't quite get the rules well enough to know which is right.

This is a real stupid rule.. and should be in teh FAQ as the card text dose not descibe teh effect at all.

What happens is that you put on the tokens and he joins the 1st player as a ally. That is it. There was a discussion about this when carrock came out and Nate responded. He DOSE NOT swap along with the 1st player token. There was a rule request to nate on this and he responded saying this was how it is.

I completely agree that the wording is so that he should travel with the 1st player token.

Well, first rule is of course gf/wife is always right (even/especially when actually wrong) gran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif] .

Second, she was actually right in this case. Grimbeorn goes to the first player when his 8th token is placed and that player controls him from there on (barring an elimination of that player). Unlike Wilyador is Rhosgobel who bounces around each turn, Grimmy is more stable.

 Huh, I always thought he was suppose to move with the first player token as well.  That's interesting.  So he stays with the player who is first player at the time he is paid off.  That means you really need to think about when to lay that 8th token.

Yes there is a different between : Join the first player and First players gain control. Grimbeorn is join so he stay  but Eagle  game text is: Gain control so he move after the first player token.
