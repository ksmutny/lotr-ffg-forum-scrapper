I just got my Roam across Rhovanion, there's only 2 copies of Glamdring, is it particular of common？

If particular, then it was the first time part missing in LCG product.

Missing a card in an AP is very uncommon. I've had situations where cards are stuck together. Do a quick double-check to see if your third copy is bonded to the back of another card. If so, a little flexing should cause it to fall off.

If that's not the case, FFG customer support on this stuff is really good. Just contact them and explain the situation and the y should send you  a copy.
