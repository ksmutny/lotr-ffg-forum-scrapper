Can you play multiple copies of Fast Hitch on the same card? For instance, could Frodo have 3 fast hitches on him at the same time? Fast Hitch isn't restricted, but it does have the "skill" keyword, so I wasn't sure if there was a ruling that said every character could only have one skill or something. Thanks!

 As far as I know, there are nothing that says that you can't put 3 Fast Hitch on any hobbit caracter, neither the card text, nor rules.

 

It can be put on heros and ally's that are hobbit.

The word Skill is in italic, it is a trait, not a keyword, which would be in bold type.  Traits do not have rules while keywords do.  So yes, a hobbit character can have multiple fast hitches attached.
