I'm new to this very interesting game.

Q: when an eneny card is engaged with a player, that enemy still counts its threat value during the quest phase? Active locations doesn't, but i can't find anything about engaged enemies...

Someone could help, please?

Only the threat in the staging area is considered.
Once an enemy is engaged with you it does not contribute its threat anymore.

 

Also we have got sub forums since yesterday. There is one for rules. Just look a little higher on the forum page. You´ll find tips and links there. New scoring system and so on.....

 

cheers
