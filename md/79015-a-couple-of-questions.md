# [A couple of questions](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/79015-a-couple-of-questions/)

## 1 [ghostdragon on February 9, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/79015-a-couple-of-questions/?do=findComment&comment=760751)

1. When a card says "Put into play" or something similar do you have to pay the resource cost (I'm guessing yes but I had a discussion with another player about this so I guessed I should ask).

 

2. What happens if a Objective (like Troll Purse) which says attach to an enemy plays but there is no-one suitable to attach it to.

 

Any help would be welcome.

1) Cards like Vilya or A Very Good Tale put allies into play with no resource cost.  If a card, we'll say Card X, states "put into play card Y," the cost will be explicitly written out.  Usually this is "exhaust 2 characters" or something like that.  You'll ignore the printed cost of card Y unless otherwise directed.

2) There is a thread here that answers your troll purse [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=713686&efpag=0] question, including an official response.  Just discard it.
