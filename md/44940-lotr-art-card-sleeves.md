Ok Gandalf for my deck and Eye of Sauron for encounter deck is a sure thinggran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif].

I think that even if i quit this game those cards and sleeves will have a place in my Middle-Earth colection librery.

 I am not feeling the Gimli sleeves....  Wandering Took on some sleeves... who knows?  The nazgul ones are pretty rad.

I got pretty excited when I saw the anouncement...but I am not so sure I like all of them. I actually I am not so convinced by the eye of sauron, one ring and gimli sleeves. I wonder if they look a lot better in real (I wouldn't be surprised).

How does this works?? You use a sleeve with an art for 1 deck? that is like 50 sleeves right? or you mix them all??

I'm a noob with card games and these type of boardgames =(

You can use them as you want. You can even put your beverages on them lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif]

But to answer your question, you put your cards in them.  What cards you put in what sleeves isn't really relevant, although I wouldn't put them in the 'opposite' sleeves than the natural backings gran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif]

Now I totally want to bring my (future) deck to a tournament (if/when they happen) using the opposite sleeves.

I plan on using Eye of Sauron for the encounter deck cards and then use the others for a different deck, maybe Gimli for a tactics deck, Gandalf for a leadership deck, etc. Nazgul I will use for this game and an AGoT decks just cause they are awesome.

 Eye of Sauron, One Ring, Nazgul. Excellent aesthetic on all of those. Gandalf and Golden Wood Singer are quite nice as well, but I tend to favor darker or more stylized/iconic images for my card sleeves, rather than character depictions.

Regardless, definitely going to pick some up whenever I finally decide to get around to buying some FFG art sleeves.

I'm guessing these never sold particularly well and, although I own two sets, part of me does wonder if the choices for the sleeves contributed to this - running your hero deck with a Nazgul or eye of Sauron would be bizarre, the one ring adds nothing over sleeving with standard clear sleeves and Gimli (as others noted here) is not the best picture for enlarging, lacking a little detail. That leaves Golden Wood Singer (Daughter of the Nimrodel), which I can see being popular with those that run Silvan decks, and Gandalf, which is a 'safe' choice.

 

All of that said, I'd still love to see more of these introduced for sleeving different thematic decks now that we can build them - Rohan, Gondor, Dunedain, Noldor, Hobbit, etc.

I have a few of the One Ring sleeves, and they certainly feel thicker and more solid than the clear sleeves they sell. I dunno if they sold well, but they definitely sold out quickly everywhere I know.

 

Also, this thread is 5 years old ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

Yeah, sorry, I realised that and wasn't sure what the etiquette was here of reviving an old thread versus starting a new one.

 

I do know of one store in the UK that still has stock of all of them but yes, for the most part prices are high now, which suggests scarcity. The fact that there's still stock at all after five years though?

I'm sure they've done reprints. Because I'm pretty sure my local store has run out of the Ring sleeves and then gotten more.

 

I tend to build/change decks often, so I've actually given up trying to sleeve thematically (healers/lore have the elf, tactics/combat has gimli, crazy decks use Gandalf and quest/spirit/leadership use the Ring.  All my decks are now sleeved in the Ring sleeves and then I have about 200 or so other player cards sleeved that are among the most commonly used cards for each given sphere.  This allows me to make changes to a deck, or build a completely new one without having to de/re-sleeve anything.

Fair enough. I like to keep my active decks sleeved in the art sleeves so that they're quickly distinguishable from my other cards, which I keep in clear sleeves. Swapping things in and out can be a faff but I don't do it so often that it really bothers me.

You're clearly not serious enough about sleeves ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

why are there not cards already in those sleeves?  lol

Because it's such a frickin' huge task that I'm nowhere near the end ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

I only have about 20ish ring sleeves that don't have cards in them atm, but as soon as Flame in the West or the next pack come out, those will likely get filled up and I'll have to buy another pack.   But the majority of my player cards - and all the encounter cards are not sleeved, except the Quest cards.

I always love hearing how different people approach this. I sleeve all my encounter cards when I get them but never sleeve the quest cards. My reasoning is that the encounter cards get more use (sometimes in different quests) and get shuffled. Wear and tear on the quest cards should be minimal.

True, but it only takes one sloppy eedjit spilling drink on it to ruin it ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

 

I sleeve everything in play.

## 23 [Slothgodfather on July 27, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/44940-lotr-art-card-sleeves/?do=findComment&comment=2329250)

I sleeve the quest cards, not for protection really, but so that they stand out in the box I have them in.   That way I can find the quest and their cards quickly since the sleeved quest cards act as dividers.

I ony play solo, so if that happens the sloppy eejit is me.

Fair enough - mine stand out for not being sleeved! Your strategy is cheaper than mine though.
