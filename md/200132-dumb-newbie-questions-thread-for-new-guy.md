Hello!

 

Just started playing.  I figure I'll just start a thread for my dumb newbie question(s)...........

 

So here is the first one:

 

During combat if the Shadow Effect states "defending character must exhaust a character"....... 

 

Can the player exhaust the blocker in this combat?  (I doubt it)

 

If you can exhaust the blocker, is the attack then undefended?

 

Thanks!

 

Peace

Remember the order of the steps for blocking

 

Beginning of Combat Phase - deal 1 shadow card face down to each enemy.

 

1. Choose an enemy.
2. Declare defender.

3. Resolve shadow effect.

4. Determine combat damage.

 

You have to exhaust the character in order to declare them as a defender.  You cannot exhaust an exhausted character (or ready a ready character).  So when it says "The defending player must exhaust a character" it must be a character who is currently ready.

Thanks!

 

OK question number two:

 

If Aragorn is committed to the quest, can he use his ability to ready himself before resolution of the "revealed" section of the encounter card?

 

Thanks!

Yes, Aragorn's response can be used after he commits to the quest.

 

It can only be used at that point, to be precise

Aragorn ready ability must be used when he commits to the quest. It can't be used later in the quest phase. After encounter cards have been revealed for example. Am I correct in that as well?

Correct.

wow interesting timing..... he commits to quest but readies himself as the quest starts. 

 

To me (a newbie) as powerful ability.

 

Peace

It is indeed a powerful ability.  Anything that can give you extra uses of a hero is strong.  When you get to deck building on your own I'd suggest trying out Aragorn, Theodred and Eowyn.  Gives you very strong questing power, Aragorn is a decent attacker/defender when needed and Theodred (hero) and Steward of Gondor (attachment) help with resource generation and Celebrain's Stone on Aragorn helps with resource matching.

 

Note that both Aragorn and Theodred's abilities work as a response to them commiting to the quest.  So you commit all three heroes to the quest, then use Theodred to put a resource on Aragorn, then spend that resource to ready him with Aragorn's response.

Hello!

 

OK next newbie question:

 

In Don't Leave the Path side 3B.......

 

When revealed, Each player must search the encounter deck and discard pile for a SPIDER of his choice and add it to the staging area.

 

The Players must find and defeat  Ungoliant's Spawn to wind the game........

 

In a solo game......

 

1.  Do I search the deck/pile for a spider *and* Ungoliant's Spawn and add them to staging area

2.  Do I search the deck/pile for a spider and then keep playing until Ungoliant's Spawn crops up in the course of the game

3.  Can I search the decks for Ungoliant's Spawn and use that as the "Spider"

4.  Something else all together

 

Thanks!

 

Peace

Ungoliant's Spawn is a Spider. It has the Spider trait. So yes, most likely you find Ungoliant's Spawn in the encounter deck and take it out so you can kill it (though you don't have to, you can choose to take out a different Spider enemy and just wait for Ungoliant's Spawn to randomly turn up in staging, but it's hard to think of a reason why you'd want to).

Well as I posted in another thread, I won my first quest.  Now I am starting Passage Through Mirkwood with the other decks.  I need to learn the pros and cons for each deck.

 

Question:  When can you do an Action?  Can you do them at the start and end of each phase?  For instance the "Exhaust to heal" actions........  can they be done to heal a character before the end of combat phase (saying an otherwise doomed character)?

 

Thanks!

 

Peace

You can take actions during any action window. If you look in the back of the rulebook at the turn summary, any part of it that's green you can take actions freely during it. The red bits you have to wait until they're done before taking any actions. In the case of combat there's additional detail in that there are action windows after each step of resolving an attack.

So in your example, yes you can exhaust a Daughter of the Nimrodel to heal a hero during the combat phase, and this can save their life if you do it in the middle of them defending an attack which would otherwise kill them, because you have multiple action windows before you reach the point of actually placing damage. One exception however is that if the hero would be killed by the shadow effect (as in a direct damage like the Hummerhorns shadow), the shadow effect resolves immediately when you flip over the shadow card, so in that circumstance the hero is dead before you get to the action window (and because your defender is gone you now have an undefended attack for even more hero-killing fun). Direct damage shadow effects aren't too common though, thankfully.

Is there an order that I have to deal with attackers (lowest threat first, etc), or can I deal with them in any order I wish?

 

Or is it all simultaneous?

 

Thanks!

Any order.

Hi!

 

OK dumb question that would seem to have come up before now :rolleyes: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_rolleyes.gif]

 

If a card deals damage to an enemy (for instance Gandaf's ability to deal 4 damage to an enemy, or Swift Strike dealing 2), does armor reduce this damage

 

Thanks!

An enemy or character's Defence Strength (I guess this is what you mean by armour---the value next to the shield) does not protect them from such damage. The Defence score only reduces damage taken during Attacks.

 

In a couple of sets there is an enemy keyword called Toughness which does reduce this sort of damage.

thanks Nathan.  You are correct, I was talking defense strength.
