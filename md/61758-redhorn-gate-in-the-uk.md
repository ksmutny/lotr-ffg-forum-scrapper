 Has anyone got it yet?

 

Mine's coming off the internet, but someone else ordered it for me, so I don't get the dispatch email -wondered if my copy had got lost somewhere, or this was just the normal US/UK time-lag?

I'm expecting mine tomorrow. Ordered it from 13th floor, who usually send the dispatched emails out around 3pm (not that I'm obsessed, or anything). It's due for release today, so I'm hoping in five hours or so, I'll get the email...
