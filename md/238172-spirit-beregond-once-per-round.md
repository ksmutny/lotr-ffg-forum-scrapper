The ability of Spirit Beregond can only be triggered once per round. Is it once per round per player? Or once per round, period?

For example, Lore Aragorn is once per game per player.

FAQ 1.8: (1.51) Limitations on card effects

When a card with a triggered effect has a limit on the number of times that effect can be triggered (i.e. “Once per round,” “Limit 3 times per phase,” etc.), the limit is specific to that card. However, if a card has a limit of “once per game,” that limitation is specific to the player who triggered it.
 
 
So Beregond is "once per round, period".
