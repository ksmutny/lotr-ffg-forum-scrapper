For those of you who enjoyed Ian's custom First Age set, the first expansion, Trial Upon the Marches, was released on Friday!  The first ranged hero has come to First Age: Beleg Strongbow.  He's a blast to play!

 

You can find the release article here [https://talesfromthecards.wordpress.com/2015/03/20/trial-upon-the-marches-is-here/] and the downloadable content here [https://talesfromthecards.wordpress.com/doom-mastered-cycle/].

 

Wonderful job, Ian, and keep up the good work!

As far as I can tell, it's great! This scenario has gone a long way and the end result is really cool. You get to fight against a lot of Orcs and other creatures and you're also tasked to destroy a machine of Morgoth. Epic!

 

I really admire the amount of time and love Ian puts into his First Age sets, it's really cool!
