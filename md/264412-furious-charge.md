Hi All

My question is around the flip part. If you just reveal the card, should you flip Thaurdir at the end of the quest phase? Despite it never was the active quest.

 

Forced: When at least 1 progress is placed on Furious Charge, each character gets –2 [Defense] until the end of the round. If Thaurdir is Captain side face-up, flip him.
Response: After Furious Charge is defeated, add 10 progress to the main quest.

I think that Forced trigger will only happen if you place progress.  Obviously the 1st part of the trigger only happens in that case.  I'm not 100% sure about that 2nd sentence, because the effect doesn't use the word "Then."  But if it came up in my own came, I would only resolve it if I placed progress.
