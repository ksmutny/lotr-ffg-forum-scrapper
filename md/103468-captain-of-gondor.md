Excellent card in my opinion. Should go straight into any deck that uses tactics Boromir, since he will be able to make use of both bonuses thanks to his readying action. Not a huge fan of the art though, for a game that boasts about not being influenced by the movies (not true at all), that helmet has clear similarities to the Jackson gondorian helmets with the pointy top, which is not mentioned in the books. Then again this is just a nitpick.

 

Also, I was still expecting more of a true preview, but still this was a pretty insightful second breakfast and not just a decklist.

Wow, it's not restrcted or has to be attached to a tactics hero., every warrior hero that has 3 attack just went to 4. Of course it is unique, but this card has got a lot of deck building potential. I have not read the rest of the article yet, which seems to address theme, but this card will probably be a staple in any solo deck i do that has access to tactics and a warrior hero Boromir or not. Looks like a pretty powerful card.

Wow indeed... I thought that it was a player made card initially. I Like that it makes use of the warrior trait and restricting it to heroes, warriors and making it unique is probably enough to stop it becoming over powered as such.

 

I agree that this card could have plenty of use with or without Boromir.

## 5 [Tracker1 on April 9, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/103468-captain-of-gondor/?do=findComment&comment=1042540)

After reading the rest of the article, i think the developers are absolutely taking the right approach by respecting all players choices of how they want to play the game. I think they did a great job with this card, and I am excited to see the other titles, i'm very happy to have cards that are flexible, and can be used in a number of different decks. By providing more cards that play off of the seldom used traits of the different heroes, these cool cards should be able to be used in a variety of decks of theme players and optimal deck players (not sure what to call it). Very happy with the direction their going. Definitely enough to get me excited.

What card number does that appear to be?  To me it looks like #140.  If so we probably won't see it until the last AP.

That was a really great article overall.  Always cool to hear Caleb's insight and i think i speak for most of us that this game has a really exciting future in his hands.  This may seem overly cliche but he just "gets it".  We want theme, we want good player cards, we want trait support but we also want the spheres to retain their importance.  It seems he's accomplishing all of this splendidly

## 10 [Gizlivadi on April 9, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/103468-captain-of-gondor/?do=findComment&comment=1042622)

I think they did a mistake in making the Steward of gondor card with such an ability. If they wanted to make a card that makes 2 resources each turn and that's gonna be used in every deck with leadership, gondor or not, it should have been something neutral flavor wise, like Resourceful. To avoid thematic inconsistencies. Steward of Gondor as a title attachment should have been something like Captain of Gondor, a less powerful card that makes more sense thematically, not one of the most powerful cards in the game that every deck is going to use.

Awesome card! It also combo's with Valiant Warrior from Black Riders allowing you to put it on whomever you put Valiant Warrior on for the rest of the campaign! My plan (when road darkens and this card comes out) is to put Valiant Warrior on Elrohir so for the rest of the campaign I can play Steward of Gondor and Captain of Gondor on him (plus Arwens boost, gondorian shield etc) giving him yet another defensive boost and also allowing him to strike back with 4 instead of 2 after all his blocking as long as he has a resource token left.

I'll add it to my super solo deck. With it + Gondorian Shiled + Arwen, my Boromir becomes 6 defense bulwark that you just can't pierce through.

Wow its more Gondor support but not gondor exclusive:) Poor faramir thou not a warrior but he is still captian of gondor... or not..

All that said nice with a small preview to tickel us not overwhelm us with cards. good jobb from the ffg-lotr team. I wonder what the ranger titel will be like???

## 22 [MyNeighbourTrololo on April 9, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/103468-captain-of-gondor/?do=findComment&comment=1042968)

I wouldn't call it a "Gondor" support, it has nothing to do with Gondor in terms of gameplay.

## 23 [PsychoRocka on April 9, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/103468-captain-of-gondor/?do=findComment&comment=1042972)

Would be awesome if the ranger attachment gave you a benefit or reward for making ranged attacks. I know ranger isn't necessarily tied to the ranged mechanic and alot of ranger hero's don't even have ranged but I still think this would be cool and I love making devastating one hit ranged attacks =) (Wouldn't do anything for solo either so probably not...) Alternatively maybe something that makes traps cheaper/easier to play? 1 cost ranger spikes would be epic.

As for noble no idea but the obvious guess would be some sort of resource gain, hopefully they do something different though.

## 24 [MyNeighbourTrololo on April 9, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/103468-captain-of-gondor/?do=findComment&comment=1042984)

Ranger: +2 Attack against enemies with a trap attached.

I'm just happy to see Caleb & Co filling in some of the gaps left before them: hero traits, secrecy, elves. All the traits getting support In this cycle feels like a real attempt at them shoring them things up.

 

The article itself, and Captain of Gondor, were great too. Our game is in good hands!

## 27 [Scroll Lock on April 9, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/103468-captain-of-gondor/?do=findComment&comment=1043157)

Awesome card! Shame, it is unique.

I am happy he said, we will get something for rangers, my favourite deck type(because Silvans are not official yet).

I am very curious what will they give to scouts. Scrying would make sense, but I hope it will be more resourceful.

## 28 [MyNeighbourTrololo on April 9, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/103468-captain-of-gondor/?do=findComment&comment=1043162)

Silvan is a faction affiliation, while ranger is an occupation, if you will.

I'll reiterate my support for Caleb & Co.  The game is very complex and must walk a fine line due to its mechanics, theme and community - as the article spells out well.  Brilliant job so far, guys!

Man, Captain + Gondorian Shield + Beregond = Impenetrable! This is especially true in my 2-hero tactics secrecy deck (Legolas and Beregond) where I'm practically always doing optional engagements.

 

Then again, it might come in more handy with Legolas because 6 def is pretty much all you need anyway and more damage = more deaths = more progress. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I really wonder if the obviously lore attachment that will help rangers will be directed towards rangers as a whole as in Dúnedain, the rangers of the north or to the rangers of Ithilien specifically.

I dont think they'll be able to make it overly specific.  The Ithilien archers (thankfully) dont have their own keyword other than just "ranger" and out of the 6 different Dunedain characters, only two of them do not also carry the "ranger" trait as well. (Son of Arnor and Dunedain Watcher).

So if there is a more-or-less similar "scout" attachment coming up we could expect some (Dunedain & Silvan?) heroes in the RM cycle with the scout trait I guess. As there's no heroes with the scout trait now to my knowledge.

I was talking more about the theme of the card as in the illustration, the ability, whether it would be about damaging enemies in the staging area or maybe putting progress on the quest or whatever.

My idea for a scout attachment that doesn't involve scrying:

 

Lookout (Lore) (Unique) cost: 2

 

Title.

 

Attach to a scout character.  

 

Quest Action:  Exhaust Lookout and attached character.  Until the end of the phase, place 1 progress token on each location revealed by the encounter deck.

... and a Noble attachment:

 

Grand Marshal (Leadership) (Unique) cost: 2

 

Title.

 

Attach to a noble hero.

 

Resources from the attached hero's resource pool may be spent to pay for allies that share a trait with the attached hero.

## 42 [Distractionbeast on April 11, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/103468-captain-of-gondor/?do=findComment&comment=1046221)

Dunedain Chieftain (Spirit) (Unique) Cost: 2

 

Title.

 

Attach to a dunedain character.

 

Response:  When a dunedain character participates in an attack that kills an enemy, that character's controller may reduce his threat by 1.

I remember many disliked them, and I was not particularly fond of the Emyn Muil quest either, but I now miss the location heavy quests. I hope they appear again. It has been too much battle and too little travel lately. And most of the locations are nuisance you cannot do anything about, so Northern Tracker or even such a staple card like Asfaloth have lost a bit of their mark, recently. I really feel quests with heavy logistic issues should come back.

## 45 [Style75 on April 15, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/103468-captain-of-gondor/?do=findComment&comment=1050269)

I have to agree with Ana, I would love to see a new take on the location heavy quest, but done properly this time around (not just random wandering gathering up victory points).

 

Back to the original topic..... I love this card but I'm not too fond of the art as it is way too similar to the armor used in the movies. I think FFG does it best when they present their own take on Tolkien's world and not mimicking Peter Jackson. Seriously, check out the comparison's below. FFG should be careful of Jackson's lawyers might take notice!

I'm going to have to be a dissenter here.  I am really fond of the Lord of the Rings movies (they're what got me to be such a huge fan of everything Tolkien) and I actually really like the artwork on the Captain of Gondor card because the Gondorian armor in the movies is amazing.  Maybe I'm also getting a bit overly happy at the idea of putting the Captain of Gondor and Horn of Gondor attachments on Boromir and sending him out to slay Orcs in the ruins of Osgiliath...

I love the movies as well, but for that I have Lotr tcg. When I play Lotr lcg I want to have a totally different perspective. That's why I don't particularly like the art on Captain of Gondor, as well as in Follow Me! Wingfoot, on the other hand, is one of the best pieces of artwork to be in this game in my humble opinion. The new Creature enemies in the Nin-in-Eilph also have amazing art.

I've never minded the FFG artists having a more liberally adapted style to that of Jackson's movie. I certainly understand the unique rights each party has, but this is still the same universe and creations we are all enjoying and I personally don't get bent out of shape over these artistic decesions.

I prefer artwork here diferent than film. At starting i was hoping the same relationship, lol. I was disapointed when i bought the core and i saw legolas and aragorn diferents than the film. Now, i dont know why but i prefer very much so, i prefer artwork totally diferent than the film.

 

PD: waiting for Richsabre... when he returns he will be Richsabre the white :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Rich is going through some personal issues, he will indeed return all the more powerful.

Well it looks like this card will be seen in The Antlered Crown.  Boromir will be so happy.

Yeah, during Celebrimbor unboxing they said this cycle (Ring-maker) is also focused om the title/trait attachment. Wingfoot Ranger, Heir of Mandir (or whatever name) is Noble, this one will be the Warrior one. Cool
