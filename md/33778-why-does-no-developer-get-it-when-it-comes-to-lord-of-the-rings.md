One of the most popular card games there was, was the original Star Wars CCG.  Why?  You could play as dark or light side.

So here a developer has the chance to make a new lord of the rings in which they could FINALLY make a LOTR game that could give you Light against Dark and instead they choose to do ANOTHER **** cooperative LOTR???  Why do people constantly keep doing this with LOTR?  Even decipher's was just a race to the end and it wasn't like you actually had a full dark deck against a light deck.  No, instead the bad guys were again just an after thought and just played for a phase or 2. 

People WANT to be able to play as a nazgul with orcs, trolls, etc at their command, people want to be orcs, people want to have a 'balrog' deck.  Such a complete shame and waste again of another LOTR license.

Please wake up.

I played this at GenCon by the way, and why the mechanics are fine, the coopertive play again leads to sheer boredom.  We left extremely let down.

You could play as Nazgul in MEccg and you played as bad guys and good guys in Deciphers game. So there is two card games that both have exactly what you are asking for.

Try War of the Ring or Lord of the Rings: The Confrontation. Those games let you play on the bad guy side.

So you replied without even reading the post... like most trolls.  Had you bothered to read, you'd see I specifically stated that having bad guys as just a 'part' of the deck and as after thoughts was not even remotely close to what people are looking for.  Also, again, had you bothered to read, you'd see I specifically stated that decipher's star wars ccg where you could have a light DECK and a dark DECK was the goal.  And then I even went on to describe having a nazgul deck commanding orcs, trolls, etc.  Love having to repeat the whole post since you can't be bothered to read it in the first place but want to respond because you feel the need to jump into a conversation you apparently don't belong in.

Sorry ellindar but Toqtamish is right. In MEccg with the Lidless Eye expansion you could play as oneof the Nazgul. And there were also the fallen wizard expansion (with it you could play as a  fallen wizard- like Saruman after being corrupted) and with th Balrog expansion you could play as the balrog or Sauron himself

The troll in this case is you. You came here specifically to rant about something that is not true. With ME CCG you played as the Nazgul with the lidless eye expansion and you could play as corrupted evil versions of the wizards with another expansion. There was an expansion, the last one, that was entirely fixed and let you play as the Balrog of Moria. With Deciphers you could build decks built more around the shadow side than the fellowship.

 

 If you want to complain or get involved in the other games they still have very active communities.

lol, I'm not talking about a ccg that is 20 years old... what a joke... I played ME ccg a million years ago and while it was an 'ok' game, its not a new developement with new art, etc.  And as for decipher, you refuse to read my posts again.  Either read it and reply intelligently or stop trolling my thread.  You can not play as a full good deck or full bad deck and your statement you could play as more of a shadow than fellowship is false since your cards had to be exactly split between the two.  I am here 'ranting' about something that is very valid in my opinion.  Two LOTR card games in a row that again don't give you the choices you should have.   And that is lame in my opinion.

 I am quite thankful that we are not playing as the Shadow.

The reason this worked in Star Wars was because through the movies, we saw both sides of the story.  A significant amount of the time we watched the Empire plan and maneuver without the Rebels around. 

 

In Lord of the Rings, we do not see the shadow side of the story.  Tolkien did not write material through the eyes of shadow.  I personally do not WANT to play those characters.  I have no attachment to them because I only ever encountered them through the eyes of the Fellowship and that has bred contempt for their brand of evil.  The Empire was sexy: awesome outfits, mechanical precision, military perfection.  The Shadow is dirty, dark and disturbing.

Well said Chevee.

 

As for OP if its so lame, don't play it I guess. There are lots of options that let you play the bad guys as you want but none of those appeal to you either it seems.

 

And now I go back to the real world instead of talking to the proverbial wall, you are right and everyone else is wrong, blah blah blah.

That 15 year old CCG, had the ability to play the evil side.  After the core game and it's 1st two expansions they made a new core game called Lidless Eye.  You could play the evil side as a Nazgul and control shadow agents instead.

I am fairly certain that no matter how good this new game is, it will not be better than MECCG.  Middle-Earth CCG has a very high learning curve, but once you get it...this new CCG will look rather childish in comparison.  Also, they had access to everything back then LOTR, Hobbit, Silmarillion, Lost Tales, everything.  Nowdays you can pretty much only get rights to the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings and nothing else. This same thing has happened to the developers of the new Lord of the Rings RPG "One Ring".

In short, you are  wrong.  You could play a the evil side with MECCG.

Edit: I see this has already been discussed.

It will be hard pressed for this game to beat the depth of ME ccg, but it will I am sure beat it in ease of play. ME ccg is by far probably the most complicated CCG I have encountered, well that or Heresy.

Would that be the same Decipher Star Wars CCG  that had more magic bullets than a Kennedy assassination?  Just checking. 

I can understand your gripe, but let's be real for a second. Is the market REALLY there for sustainable shadow faction game play? I can't say it is. Also, all the best shadow monsters ridiculously strong. It'd make for a design nightmare. We can't  beef up the hobbits to wreck shop like Conan in order to keep up, and the nazgul, dragons, balrogs, etc cannot be nerfed. It'd ruin the spirit of both.

When one hero such as aragorn can equal 100 orcs, then yes, one nazgul can equal 100 gondor warriors.  As always, stop thinking in terms of movies, books, etc. and start thinking in terms of a card game.  Its exactly the same.  And unfortunately, this living card game will be 'ok', but will not be what it could have been, just like so many others.

And as for the star wars card game and the 'magic bullets' all I have to say is LOL... after the years and years it ran and the sheer number of cards and expansions, that's going to happen to a CCG.  Haha, omg... unless maybe you were joking, in which case I'll laugh along with you instead of at you.

In the end, you can appeal to one small crowd, or you can appeal to everyone, let the game be about the PLAYER and what the PLAYER would like to do.  If its to be successful, you need to broaden the horizons.

The tricky thing about thinking you speak for all "people" — you discover that the clever little primates want different things.

So don't pretend to speak for me. I couldn't be more thrilled that FFG made three great decisions here: 1. Solo possibilities; 2. Co-op structure; 3. LCG format. I am 100 percent onboard with the early direction of this game. I'm not in the slightest bit disappointed. And I'm also a "people," so I'll just go ahead and speak for myself.

You're right about the troll, though. You'll see him when you look in the mirror.

 ... said the troll.

It sounds like you're looking for a different game. Not to mention a clue, but that's a separate subject.

You've stated your case, weak as it might be. It's no one's fault that you're not getting the reaction you're looking for. So feel free to go troll some other games now.

Oh, BTW, the LotR co-op boardgame allows for this "dark side player" thing that seems to make you so tumescent. It's called the Sauron expansion. I'll even provide a link: http://tinyurl.com/y8ufsnp [http://tinyurl.com/y8ufsnp]

Ok little boy... I'll spell it all out for you since you still can't read... (do they teach you kids anything in school today?)

1. Not looking for a board game... referenced CARD games specifically.  Such a waste of your time.

2. Correct, this game is not for me and I will not be purchasing it, and I came in to find out why people who license the CCG seem to like to do LOTR as an adventure path, or co-op or whatever, and not finally a one against one.  And also the option of light or dark.

3. I have got the reaction I was looking for, you again haven't bothered to read.  LOL

4. I was actually at GenCon and played the game, and shared my opinion with many others who also got up from the game with the same opinion. 

5. I never said you or any other fan boy had to dislike the game.  Nor did I say you're an idiot if you do like the game.  This game will appeal to a small sector and I hope those folks enjoy it immensely.  But after decipher's game, they should have tried to appeal to a different mass.

Finally, and I hope you were actually able to read this time so I don't have to repeat any of this in later posts like always... but you are trolling my thread.  If you don't like the opinion here, feel free to shut the hell up.  Oh, and I guess now we know who has the clue, and it isn't you.

Its not your thread, you don't own it simply because you opened this particular can of worms.

YOU want a game that allows you to play as the bad guys in LotR, we have all let you know of games that allow you to do exactly what you want from them. Yes they are no longer supported product wise, but ME ccg still is supported with an active community world wide and continues to be one of the highest priced "dead" ccg's going.

YOU have also resorted to calling everyone who disagrees with you a troll, yet fail to see that you are the troll who came here simply to start an argument.

YOU also decided to then curse at someone for having a different opinion. Great way to fail at making a valid argument or winning any support.

Didn't say I owned it, but it is my thread, I started it, and can state my opinion (and that of a lot of others which if you would READ you would know, its not just ME.  GOD read **** before you post.  Second, no, you haven't let me know anything, ONE old card game 15 years old does, which I already know about and is in fact a dead game.  There are no others. 

I called one person a troll because of an attack post, not an opinion or response.  I didn't call 'everyone' a troll lol.  Nice generalization tho.  If I am starting an argument because you disagree, simply disagree and don't argue.  I have zero probelms with someone who disagrees and have admitted there will be some folks who like the game, even tho the majority of the folks at gencon that we talked too also disliked it.  Which i've already stated if you would f'ing READ.  Also, the second replier actually replied with simple things... two games he thought I'd like, did you see us argue?  Nope, in fact we had two nice replies.  But the 'fan boys' who attack and haven't even played the game will get their dues, sorry to disappoint.

I did not curse at someone for an opinion, i cursed at someone who posted a simple attack.  ********* [ADMIN: Edited for foul language]

True, but there were limitations. More on those in a bit.

Perhaps your definition of cooperative game differs from mine...but neither ICE's METW or Decipher's LOTR were true cooperative games. While it is true that, no matter which player won the game, good always triumphed over evil; however both of the aforementioned games were very much player vs. player as opposed to players vs. game.

> Why do people constantly keep doing this with LOTR? 

While I don't have an answer for you I do have a couple of guesses, one of which focuses on the theme of the license. In the books good won out over evil; and it may well be the wish of the Tolkien Estate puts some sort of restriction on the license to ensure that games reflect that outcome.

More likely, Fantasy Flight Games saw an unfulfilled niche in the market and decided that LotR would be a good fit.

If this is truly your goal then perhaps you should email customer service and ask them to forward your question to the game's designers; as they are the only ones who can give you a definitive answer to this question.

propbably not worth commenting as the dude has already been tossed out of the airlock but i thought i'd defend deciphers choice in game mechanics.

When the game came out they explained via a web article the reasons why they didn't follow star wars on the light deck dark deck path and when i read the article i have to agree with them. they explained that due to the movie footage and story the villans were too few and and were mainly masses of orcs. this fact does show in the shadow minions that we currently have in the game. they also added that most people would want to play the fellowship heros and that the people who would want to play the bad guys were out there but they were a minority group and they were in buisness to sell a card game that people wanted. The game won some sort of an award for it's innovative game mechanics.

of course thats not to say that they didn't overdo it and it eventually destroyed itself from its own success lol

Lord of the rings in essence is about fellowship and teamwork and that's why most games use that theme in co-operative play.

That was an incredible experience.

At first, I was irritated by the OP's tone. But then as I continued to read, he became a hilarious parody of himself (or herself). And then he got booted, which my restored my faith in reason and civil discourse. This has been a great thread.

Unfortunately, I never got a chance to deliver this zinger:

"Of course you want to play as the forces of Sauron. You're already a troll."

ZING!

Then I would have probably followed it up with something about turning to stone in the sunlight. I can't quite remember how it works.

G'day folks! I was enjoying an all-about-LOTR-search on the internet during my hour of free time when I stumbled upon this website . Curious to learn more about this card game, I searched through the forum threads.

I've just spent the last twenty minutes reading through all of this topic, and since I have some more free time before my lovely piano calls me back to practice, I've decided to make a response with my own analysis!!

At first, I was going to take a degree of pitty on Mr. Ellindar... I needed only reread the posts a bit to get a better view of his position in all this. His first post is filled question mingled with ranting disappointment; a bad combination. If he had left out the "emotion-response instigating" remarks in his post, he would not be labeled as a troll. Unfortunately, many of his posts were filled with remarks and "sasses" that instigated such, and part of the definition of a troll is to make posts that provoke users into an emotional response. This was rather mild though, as Ellindar was indeed staying on-topic, and as is known, trolls make posts to get threads off-topic. The statement that Ellindar was a troll at the start is very debatable at this point.

Following the two posts after Ellindar's first post, Ellindar then proceeds to immediately accuse Toqtamish of being "like most trolls" with his post. This is a blind accusation, seeing that the post had no intent of going off-topic or instigating rageful replies. Toqtamish may have not understood exactly what Ellindar was saying (making posts not totally relevant to Ellindar's view of the topic, by unintentional means. Though it is still debatable whether Toqtamish was on topic but rather that Ellindar took his comment incoherently?), but the post is in no way "trollish". Here Ellindar ruins all respect he could have had by being the first to insult another user, a trollish behavior. Though, Ellindar still remains on-topic, but now assuming that no one understood his first "questions", he responds agressively.

Toqtamish quickly accused Ellindar of being a troll after Ellindar accused him of such, out of retaliation(assuming). Through the following posts, the topic is corrupted from being on-topic by both sides of the ensuing arguement as the world "troll" is thrown about wildly. Ellindar is enraged by assuming no one understands him and by being accused of being a troll, when he believes he is not.

The problem is, Ellindar's goal in this thread is hazy to understand. He discusses very well in his posts WHAT he is talking about(with rage and argument filled in the mix with everyone elses') but the goal of WHY he is stating it in this thread, in the manner of which he presents it, is very questionable. It is best and easiest to assume he wished, or assumed himself, that people in this forums would enter a debate with him and he assumed at least a sum of the users would be in agreement with him. Since no one was on his side of the issue, he first assumed no one understood him, but after the topic turned into an "accusation fest", he realized otherwise and ensued to defend himself with harsh means of words and such. When Ellindar used curse words in his growing aggravation, he broke a wall and the topic that was partly on-topic became little more than a "spam thread." ( you could easily assume my post as a spam also, seeing that I joined this forum with the first and foremost reason of simply posting a reply not relevant to the card-game product in this thread.)

All in all, Ellindar failed in whatever he meant to achieve by use of harsh language, a big no-no if one wishes to be understood as "civil" over the internet. Though I disagree that it was "right" for everyone to be tossing the "troll" word all about, Ellindar did indeed, and inevitably  became a troll on this thread.

((I mainly had the fascination to practice my humanistic and psychological analysis capabilities via this argument that broke-out upon this thread.))

I have long thought a "Dark vs Light" tcg would be great for LOTR.  Classic epic battle of good vs. evil.  If you want that, you aren't going to get it here.  And that isn't a bad thing since a 1v1 game and a co-op game are very, very different styles of games.

 

That being said, I played the LCG demo at GenCon at the FFG booth.  Myself and another guy played the game from beginning to end, even as our demo guide wandered off to help other people get started.  I walked away mightily impressed with the game, thinking it was great cooperative game - not just a good one, but a great one.

 

I loved it.  I though the art was great.  I thought the card design was well done and organized.  The flow of play was engaging, but not overly complex.  I was really quite impressed.

 

Now I also realize that this was a demo version, not the full version.  Things may have been stacked/slanted in one direction over another.  But it still played as a strong co-op game nonetheless.  It is right up there with some of the best co-op games on market, like Battlestar Galactica and Shadows Over Camelot.

 

I am looking forward to this game in a BIG way.  I plan to buy two copies of the base set.  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I'd say at this point lets let the analysis of Ellindar lie, he's gone, its over and best left in the past as a bad/funny memory. 

 

Crow, able to provide any card spoilers or stuff from having played the demo ?

As this thread seems to have descended back into sensible discussion, and I've just had a bit of a brainwave on the subject I'll chip in.

 

Free people vs. Dark Lord, I could see how some people would have preferred this to what we got with the Decipher game. Obviously you have the ability in MECCG to play as the bad guys, but that isn't really a direct duelling game in so much as both deck have a set of threats to play on you opponent.

So we don't have a light vs. dark play style like Star Wars.

I don't think Star Wars is the right game to be thinking of, as that is pretty much the same cards on each side, with different pictures. Or rather both sides play the same and are trying to do the same thing. This just isn't catching the flavour of the conflict in the books.

So I was think at better fit would be Netrunner CCG, or at least in as much as the game play is asymmetric. So both sides word with a different rules set and different card types. Even more so is I recall discussion around the time WotC dropped the game (the fools, best CCG ever!) Where a lot of people thought the game would have sold better as a fantasy theme of parties of heroes breaking into dungeons and defeating an Evil Overlord TM schemes.

I think that as a starting place could lead to a dark vs. light LotR which also captures the feel. and overcomes the big differences between the two sides in the story.

Thoughts?

In MECCG you could play with a minions party, with a Ringwraith instead of a Wizard (or even with Sauron), and a minion party at the same location that a hero party could engage them in combat, count the frags as victory points, etc.

Of course your minion party could avoid the hero company, and get the VP in any other way. 

 

So if you want a light vs darkness kind of game, you already can.

 

Why develop the same idea again?

lol, I'm not talking about a ccg that is 20 years old... what a joke... I played ME ccg a million years ago and while it was an 'ok' game, its not a new developement with new art, etc.  

 

Is that like a long long time ago?

One of the most popular card games there was, was the original Star Wars CCG.  Why?  You could play as dark or light side.

 

 

I realize this is somewhat off-topic, but I was bothered just enough by this statement's omission of the fact that in fact both Star Wars collectable card games had this gameplay quirk to point it out.

On that topic, I fervently wish either of those games would get the LCG treatment.

Finally, on this topic, I think the reason for this is that the Lord of the Rings saga is not at its core a mere good vs. evil struggle. It's got that element to it, certainly, but it's not as much about Man vs. Orc, Free Peoples vs. Mordor as it is about a group of heroes venturing bravely through the wilderness, knowing not what they'll find there.

By contrast, Star Wars has always been firmly focused around the perennial conflict between the light and dark sides of the Force, as well as those caught in the struggle. Certainly an LCG set in Middle-earth could be built in this fashion, but it would be inappropriate to call it Lord of the Rings.

It might be that they add after some time some evil heroes and missions for them. As a start point is ok and it's good to have something different that time. I think is fresh blood in all kind of games to work together instead fight vs each other. Let's see how it would work but for family I see potentially this game as an interesting position.

 Seems to me that this game will have the potential in later expansions for exactly that. A team game of shadow players with quests to beat the good guys. I see no reason at all why this shouldn't be the case.

While I'm never in favor of Necromancing threads, since someone's done it already here (for no reason), I'd just like to point out how stupid the OP sounds now that the game has actually been released...aplauso.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/aplauso.gif]
