I read here and there in topics about nightmare mode, but i haven't yet understand everything:

What happens to heroes resource's pools

what happens to allies in play?

What happens to heroes attachment, even the condition ones?

What happens to my play hand?

This is a OT:if I play Will of the West do I Shuffle even it into my deck or it remains in the discard pile?

## 2 [Bohemond2 on June 1, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47687-nightmare-faq/?do=findComment&comment=478182)

Resources go away, allies go away, attachments go away, cards in hand are discarded.

When you play a card, you resolve its effects and then discard it.  So, WIll of the West does not reshuffle itself.

The rule book.  The only changes that you make to the normal rulers are as follows.

"For a “nightmare” level challenge, do not reset threat, hit points, or player decks at the beginning of each scenario."

So, you don't get to start with anything in play.  You get a normal six card hand.  If the rules don't say you do something differently in nightmare, you play like a standard game.

RULEBOOK:
"For a 'nightmare' level challenge, do not reset threat, hit points, or player decks at the beginning of each scenario."

I don't see the link between 'do not reset... player decks' meaning Will of the West and other cards don't work as normal.
After *the beginning of each scenario*, the game is as it always was.



My interpretation of the nightmare rules:

 

- Threat levels remain as is. (not reset)
- Hit points (on characters) remain as is. (not reset)
- The new Encounter deck is shuffled and all cards in play from the old encounter deck are removed from play. (reset)
- Players don't draw a new hand, as that is related to the player deck. (not reset)
- Players don't remove any characters or attachments from play, as that is part of the player deck. (not reset)

Resources are not mentioned... (so why make any changes?)

## 7 [Bohemond2 on June 1, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47687-nightmare-faq/?do=findComment&comment=478664)

Will of the West never reshuffles itself, nightmare has nothing to do with it.

The rules are quite clear on the order of operations for events.

"An event card is played from a player’s hand, its text effects are resolved, and the card is then placed in its owner’s discard pile." 

The description of the nightmare rules tell you, explictly, what steps you take that are different from simply starting a new scenario. They tell you, specifically, what factors carry over.  Anything they don't mention doesn't carry over. 

Your interpretation is completly inconsistent with the game elements they do mention.  You suggest that their is an implicit instructions  that any elements not mentioned carry over.  That's exactly the opposite of what they have written.  If your reading were correct, their would be no need to mention "do not reset... hitpoints" because they would carry over, as you have suggested resources d.

The notion that cards in play and cards in hand are "part of the deck" is compeltly unsupported.  Imagine the follwing situation.  A shadow effect tells you "Place 5 cards from your deck in the discard pile."  Would you take cards in your hand and discard them?  Or allies and attachments?  Cards in play are cards in play, cards in your hand are cards in your hand, and cards in the deck are in the deck. 

## 8 [gone questing on June 2, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47687-nightmare-faq/?do=findComment&comment=478778)

Essentially, you have a nine card quest deck.
(ie. moving from scenario 1: 3B - scenario 2: 1A is similar to moving from scenario 1: 1B - 2A.)

This poster seemed to think the same way;
http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=492091 [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=492091]



If Nightmare mode means starting scenario 2 & 3 basically as you would normally, but with slightly higher than normal threat and wounds... then why bother?
It's not new.

Playing an extended 'gauntlet' scenario of 9 quest cards from a single starting hand of 6 cards, used wisely across three quests, seems far more interesting to me. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

## 9 [Ileopsoas on June 2, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47687-nightmare-faq/?do=findComment&comment=478847)

I thinq the rules doesn't really answer to our doubts...but after all, if you keep your allies and attachments, resources and your hands I would call it noob mode, not nightmare...the game is already easier if you keep your threat.

But I think you should reshuffle them in your deck, not to put them in the discard pile, since they wern't defeated!

## 10 [Bohemond2 on June 2, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47687-nightmare-faq/?do=findComment&comment=478918)

First of all, as a cooperative card games, you should play however you want.  The whole goal is to have fun.  If you want to run a 9 card quest deck, have at it!  However, that's not what nightmare mode is, according to the rules.

As Ileopsoas says, there is some ambiguity about what happens to cards on hand and in play, but the ambiguity centers around whether they are shuffled back into the deck or put into the discard pile.  But they don't continue in play.

## 11 [slaartibartfast on June 3, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47687-nightmare-faq/?do=findComment&comment=479546)

The way we've been running it is as follows:

Do not discard attachments, allies, encounter cards in play. Gives a feeling of campaign

Discard resources, discard hand buy 6 cards. Gives a feeling of passing from one quest to another.

Limit two allies per hero.

Add one more type of card to the encounter deck (as I bought 2 boxes) The deck is more dangerous that way (3 hill trolls, 2 spawns).

For 3 players 4 encounter cardsduring staging phase and 4 players 6 encounter cards.

It's very challenging but also very fun as well.

Not really.  Its a solo game.  Run nightmare however you think it will be run.  This isn't a question of rules interpretations.  The way most people seem to play nightmare has nothing to do with what is written in the rules.  It's simply the way they want to play.  I am uncertain why that requires an official statement.

## 14 [Emrad on June 4, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47687-nightmare-faq/?do=findComment&comment=479959)

Be the archetypal stubborn guy if you wish, but it is definitely an unclear matter. Nobody's right or wrong until now, and that's the problem.

I can imagine you'll go "I told you so" if you happen to be correct after all, but without rule clarification possible now, that would have just been an educated guess.

## 15 [Bohemond2 on June 4, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47687-nightmare-faq/?do=findComment&comment=480022)

Read this thread, or many of the other threads on nightmare.  The problem isn't confusion, the problem is that people want the rules to work differently.  These is absolutely zero ambiguity abou whether resources should carry over. Yet, people still suggest that they do.  There is zero ambiguity   about wehter or not allies an attachment's carry over.

"For an expert level challenge, players can attempt to defeat all 3 scenarios using the same combination of players, decks, and heroes. The score from each scenario can then be added together to get a single score measuring overall success on the entire campaign. For a “nightmare” level challenge, do not reset threat, hit points, or player decks at the beginning of each scenario. When playing such a campaign, the players should start with the “Passage through Mirkwood” scenario, follow with the “Journey Down the Anduin” scenario, and finish with the “Escape from Dol Guldur” scenario."

There are the nightmare rules in their enterity.  Show me where in the text these ideas are supported.  They just aren't there.  The rules are very specific about the limited things which carry over.  However, people don't like the rules so they pretend they are vague and make up their own rules.

All of which is fine, since the nightmare rules don't work praticularly well and can end up making the game easier.  But let's just admit that we are coming up with our own variations because we enjoy them more, not because of a lack of specificity in the rules.

So then basically what you are saying, is that you empty the heroes' resource pool at the beginning of the 2nd and 3rd scenario on Nightmare Mode and also discard any attachments and allies from play before starting a new scenario on Nightmare Mode? And people beat Nightmare Mode in this fashion whether it's solo or co-op?

Whilst I agree with you partly, and I play the Nightmare as you described it, you cannot be serious as to claiming that the rules are clear. They simply are not. To me or to many others. And I am not an idiot or even below par intelligent and I guess others are neither.

As I stated earlier in this thread, yes, there are a couple of ambiguities concerning whether you place cards in your deck or in your discard pile at the end of each scenario.  However, most of the "uncertainty" around Nightmare mode doesn't come from the text being unclear, it comes from people wanting the rules to change.  No one in this thread has shown interest in talking about the the actual text of the rules, instead people are talking about how they want house rules for  a campaign mode to work.  Which is fine, but that doesn't require some official FAQ.

By and large, the rules for Nightmare are clear.

I have beat Nightmare mode solo with those rules. Not only that, but using those rules actually makes it easier, in some cases, than just playing the scenario straight through.  I can't beast 'Escape from Dol Goldur' solo in normal mode, but I can beat it in 'Nightmare', which seems hideously backwards to me.

If wounds carry over, what happens to the prisoner in scenario 3?

Does he

1 - Have one and only one wound token

2 - Add a wound if he doesn't have any

or

3 - Add another wound which could in fact kill him?

I don't understand how that would make it easier to win that way than playing normal mode. You'd start out with wounds and a higher threat, but less cards in your deck to draw from. Unless of course you have a deck that lowers your threat by so much that it's lower when getting to Dol Goldur than if you started from scratch in normal mode. If that's the case though, wouldn't that be limiting the deck you can build as you would have to include threat reducing sphere/cards in your deck? Why bother having other spheres if you would just can plug in Spirit and win all the time? I'm not saying that's the case, but am just wondering if that's the trick for most people to beat the scenarios in Nightmare mode. "shrug"

## 22 [Bohemond2 on June 5, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47687-nightmare-faq/?do=findComment&comment=480492)

Cider, I would think it would have to be 3. I can't see anything in the rules that would indicate 1 or 2.

In my nightmare run I used a spirit/lore deck.  And, yes, I do think those spheres are best oriented to overcoming the challenges of nightmare.  I would agree that I don't think nightmare mode works that well right now.

## 24 [lleimmoen on June 5, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47687-nightmare-faq/?do=findComment&comment=480609)

It makes it easier when you finish the first quest with lower threats than you started. We play coop and normally start with 31 & 28. That makes the quest down the Anduin tough in the beginning. But we would mostly finish Mirkwood with lower threat - around 26+ using Gandalf and/or Galadhrim. That makes a great difference to the Anduin quest because you've got more time to prepare for the troll and draw Forest Snare for instance. We beat Nightmare pretty much every time now (not reseting threat and decks - discarding hands and drawing new sets, keeping damage, discarding attachments and allies) and both Anduin and Dol Guldur are easier than single game.

## 25 [lleimmoen on June 5, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47687-nightmare-faq/?do=findComment&comment=480611)

ps: and we don't even stall but always trying to finish the campaign in least possible number of turns...still you have a very decent chance to draw the required cards, especially with a mulligan

## 26 [Klaen on June 18, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47687-nightmare-faq/?do=findComment&comment=487166)

Interesting debate.

I'm not sure I can agree with Bohemond's interpretation of the rules regarding the 'your deck doesn't reset' part of the rules.

You could argue that one interpretation of this is that you carry over the mentioned variables (Threat and Damage Tokens) and that you initiaite the Setup steps detailed on page 10 of the rule book omitting the things detailed on page 27. So the decks get shuffled, you get 6 cards etc.. meaning you start with no allies/attachments, but you do start with a shuffled deck and 6 cards, carry over threat from the previous scenario and Damage Tokens.

My rationale here is that the 'Expert' game refers to you keeping the same 'players, decks and heroes' as the only real variable to playing the game from any other way. In the Expert game, my interpretation is that you don't modify your decks, players or heroes for all 3 scenarios so you can't gear-up your decks to better manage specific aspects of each scenario (no changing cards around), they have to built in a fashion that makes them a jack of all trades for each scenario and therein lies the deck building challenge.

In 'Nightmare' the above interpretation of the Expert challenge would remain the same (you would set-up as per the rule book page 7 for each scenario you play) thus meaning the ONLY difference from playing Expert would be a carry over of Damage Tokens and Threat, you still shuffle (the WHOLE deck), and grab six new cards, the only cards on the table would be the Heroes your deck starts with.

So you can see that the interpretation of the statement 'do not reset threat, hit points, or player decks' is incredibly ambiguous and open to WIDE interpretation. The rules for Nightmare don't cover what happens in the event of a hero dying in a previous scenario (arguably they remain dead as hit poits aren't reset...but again this is MY interpretation and nothing official), and they don't SPELL OUT what it means to not reset your deck.

A purist approach would say this simply means you can't re-configure your deck with any other cards than those used to defeat the previous scenario, but you still shuffle the whole deck and draw 6 cards as at the beginning of playing any scenario.

Having said all that, I do really like the idea of runinng all quests back to back, resetting nothing but the encounter decks each time, as stated perviously this would certainly give you a greater feel for a ongoing campaign between all 3 scenario's, however the counter argument that the right decks can make this a potential walk in the park and actually easier than the above rules interpretation in difficulty.

An official ruling on this, or at least some greater clarification with some 'between scenario' setup examples from Dr Nate wold be most helpful.

Thanks for reading this rather long winded post.

I don't know, but I can't really see that interpretation of "your deck doesn't reset". To me it's pretty clear that you start the next round with your deck in the same state as the previous one. If that means 22 cards are in the discard pile, so be it. To put the discards back into the deck and reshuffle would indeed be "resetting" it by almost any definition.

## 28 [Paul Grogan on June 18, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47687-nightmare-faq/?do=findComment&comment=487408)

Yep a totally valid interpretation of the rules, however no where does it define 'do not reset ...player decks', again I would argue that if Nightmare was designed to be a gruelling 3 scenario campaign you would simply move through each scenario in the order outlined in this section as if the Quest deck was a 9-10 card deck. You would not reset resource tokens or allies/attachments because you could argue that this would be an element of 'resetting' your deck. You would also not discard your hand at the end of each scenario and draw another 6 cards - because you are no longer adhering to the Setup rules on page 10 (beyond setup for the first scenario) so your hand remains the same as it was at the end of the previous scenario.

Yes I can clearly see all of the arguments as to why this would potentially make Nightmare easier than expert in some ways, as the right decks could easily gain a good foot hold and have a hoarde of allies leading into the 2nd and 3rd scenario's, significantly reducing the diffculty of these scenario's, hence why I put forward my interpretation above regarding shuffling (technically not a deck reset, as you are not changing cards around) - drawing on the description of the Expert game in the same section describing NIghtmare.

I will certainly be keen to see what the official word ends up being regarding Nightmare.

As wirtten in FAQ 1.2 the discard pile does not reset when setting up a new scenario.

Does it mean:

a) that you have to remove all cards in the discard pile from the game when setting up new and create an new (empty) discard pile?

or

b) stay there all cards in the discard pile, so you can use them during next scenario with "Dwarven Tomb" or "Stand and Fight"?
