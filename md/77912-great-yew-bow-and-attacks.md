I believe I already know the answer to this question having read the rulebook, but I just wanted to clarify. If you had two ranged characters with two "Great Yew Bows" attatched, you would could not attack an enemy with one character, and then the second, correct? You have to declare all attackers on a certain enemy all at once, which is restricted by the card text. Just wondering. Thanks.
