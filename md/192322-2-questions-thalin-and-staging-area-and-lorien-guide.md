# [2 Questions, Thalin and staging area and Lorien Guide](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/192322-2-questions-thalin-and-staging-area-and-lorien-guide/)

Does Thalin hero ability which is deal 1 damage to each enemy etc. is applicable to all monsters, including those in the staging area?

 

Althought, if during the quest phase, I commited by exemple 4 characteres including Lorien Guide, if I got a treachery card that I can't cancel and I received X damage and Lorien Guide is killed, does I need to remove my progress on the active location and my 1 spirit contribution to the total during the quest phase? Same question for Northern Tracker about the progress token in the staging area.

 

thanks

Thalin only hit enemies as they get revealed, so anything in the staging area is safe.

If the Lorien Guide is killed, I'm fairly certain you keep the progress token it placed on the active location (as it is a Response to going on the quest) but lose it's Willpower for the final resolution of the questing phase.

ok so during the quest phase, I commit my characteres, including Thalin. I got from the encounter deck the Dol Guldur Orc (when Reveled) and Eastern Crows. Does it mean that only the Dol Guldur Orc will received 1 damage before he stand in the staging area or both cards? So if its both cards, the Eastern Crows will die before they Surge effect, and the Orc will have 2 hit point instead of 3, right?

All enemies revealed during questing get damaged, so yes they both get 1 damage.  The crows die before they surge,

make sense ?

''If the Lorien Guide is killed, I'm fairly certain you keep the progress token it placed on the active location (as it is a Response to going on the quest) but lose it's Willpower for the final resolution of the questing phase''
