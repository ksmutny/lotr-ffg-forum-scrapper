# [Differing Opinions?!](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228077-differing-opinions/)

## 1 [zazoo on August 19, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228077-differing-opinions/?do=findComment&comment=2374254)

I have been reading articles and listening to pod casts and I am amazed how different some peoples opinions on heroes are.

 

For instance TBoromir seems to be a top choice for most players yet I have used him once and am not very impressed.

My top Tactics combat hero is Aragorn.

 

So below is my list of best and worst Heroes per sphere. I would like to know what others opinions are and why.

Just to clarify my best are heroes I will often include in my games (predominately multiplayer) and the worst are those that I always ignore.

 

TACTICS

BEST 3

Aragorn

Mablung

Beregond

 

WORST 1

Dori

 

SPIRIT

BEST 3

Glorfindel

Arwen Undomiel 

Eowyn

 

WORST 2

Pippin

Fatty Bolger

 

LEADERSHIP

BEST 3

Theodred

Denethor

Sam Gamgee

 

WORST 1

Balin

 

LORE

BEST 3

Elrond

Haldir of Lorien

Treebeard

 

WORST 1

Cant give worsts as I havent tried them all. But for bests:

 

Tactics I have to say I really struggle to get away from Gimli in tactics, I really rely on his huge attack. Gimli, hurt, with a weapon (Dwarrowdelf Axe) and citadel plate often seems my main way of dealing with the big health monsters.

As a result, I have hardly played any other tactics hero as my poor deck building just cant support them.

Id love to try others away from Gimli.

 

Spirit its always Eowyn, shes just too good a questor for the money. I heavily rely on her too.

 

Lore: Dont often play lore but when I have, Denethor and his scrying has been the reason.

 

Leadership: This is a tough one as Ive played a few Leadership heros. Dain is good for his dwarf buffing and then if he goes last he has some good stats too. Theodred is great for his cheap cost and his resource, Gloin I have enjoyed when partnered with a healer as his defending/resource in that mode works great, core Aragorn is good for stats and readying.... Hmmm.... I think for cost-to-gain I probably play Theodred most from those :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

Good thread, am interested in what will come into it.

I'd actually agree on a a good number of your choices. TBoromir really shines in solo play, which is why you've been underwhelmed. He allows you to send everyone questing. I've found solo play and multiplayer to require totally different approaches. In multiplayer, I would actually replace Boromir with TAragorn as well. When I play with my wife, I run a Tactigorn, Mablung, Arwen deck. When I play solo, Boromir is my go-to choice for winning.

## 4 [CommanderDave on August 19, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228077-differing-opinions/?do=findComment&comment=2374273)

Oh, for Lore, I've for Haldir and Treebeard to be a bit finicky. Both can be awesome in the right deck, but need some specific pieces. Loragorn and Erestor are fantastic though.

That makes more sense. 

I have a multiplayer deck with Tactigorn, Mablung and Hama with almost every 2 willpower red ally and good events and it is so much fun to play.

 

After seeing the love people have for Boromir, I will have to see what decks I can come up with.

 

With Haldir in multiplayer, his ability to snipe something before it gets to attack is what makes him so good.

And Treebeard is so good for questing, sure he needs healing in the deck to support it but being able to decide after you know what the threat is to increase his willpower is great.

 

 

The weird thing is I have never played Loragorn. I struggled to find that expansion so by the time I got it I have Tactigorn and never got to use him. Go figure

Erestor has such a great ability but I struggle to find the right combo with him.

Besides the Outlands one that I found on RingsDB and that deck I cant play multiplayer because it dominates so much that it is no fun for the other players.

I've found that Erestor pairs really well with any sort of resource acceleration. Denethor is the strongest, Arwen is a natural fit. Grima is an interesting choice as well. I love getting a whole bunch of cards on the board before the first quest phase.

It definitely is a matter of player perspective and game modes that you use, as well as what types of decks you are making and what your friends often bring as well.   If everyone is playing Dwarves, Dain is then arguably the best hero in the game - at that moment.  But if no one brings Dwarves, he is arguably the worst choice - at that moment.  Because all the cards are tied to various situations, traits, themes, spheres, etc, it is very hard to judge a card by itself and say that it is the best since it could be the wrong choice for a given scenario/setup.  

 

That being said, I do find there are some heroes that tend to rise above these various constraints and are just really good regardless.   So if we are going by that measure, they could be considered the best heroes of that sphere, since they are not tied to other restrictions.  Btw, to see the power of TBoromir, just look up any deck that Seastan posted with him.   If you play 2 player, he even has a version for that.   He is really really good, and because of his limitless standing ability, makes him a strong top contender for best hero in the game.  However, to make use of his standing, he takes a TON of cards to back him up.   Resource acceleration, and the Gondorian Fire and Blood of Numenor attachments are key.

 

Using your standard of best - meaning which I will use the most of, combined with some thought as to how restrictively best a hero is, here are my choices:

 

TACTICS:

Mablung - Resources for engaging, something tactics will do consistantly

Beregond - best defender in the game and includes a built in cost reduction for beefing him up

Legolas - Not actually the best attacker in the game (Bard is, Eomer is second), the 2 progress can be crucial and his trait giving access to superior weapons makes him better.

 

WORST

Beorn - I think he is worthless for general deck building since I play encounters blind and don't see the enemies first.  If they consistently have 3-4+ attack, his days will be short lived.

 

NOTE: I think Dori is amazing in a 3+ player game since he has the ability to add his defense to someone else when needed, essentially a Gondorian Shield on a stick.   It has saved many lives in my games.   Note that he does not replace Beregond.  He is always on the board.  I'll add Dori to my ent deck because it isn't important that I run Beregond.  It's only important that SOMEONE is.  

 

 

SPIRIT:

Arwen - resource acceleration in Spirit?!  Yes please!  Combo's with a card draw card in Spirit?!  Yes please!

Eowyn - Best quester in the game and can get 100% better in a 4 player game.  Also feeds Elven Light drawing.

Galadirel - Card draw and threat reduction and/or quest for 4.  Duel sphere.   Allies don't kneel first round.    

 

WORST:

Fatty and Pippin - easily the most garbage heroes of any sphere.

 

NOTE: Glorfindel is not on my list simply because I often found he was ready for nothing.  His other amazing 3 Attack stat would just site there as I often never engaged enemies and left them to the tactics players.

 

 

LEADERSHIP:

Balin - built in shadow cancellation with zero requirements.  Grants access to dwarf trait cards.

Theodred - best/most reliable resource acceleration in the game and can be used to give resources to other players.

Aragorn - built in readying effect and access to OP artifact attachments.

 

WORST: 

This is actually the hardest due to Leadership having really good heroes, even though they are often trait based or only excellent in very specific conditions.  That said:

Halbarad - granted I tend to value readying effects a LOT, but his stats are pretty trash for what he offers, his second passive is too sporadic useful and there are better Dunedain/Rangers to chose from.

 

NOTE: Balin is your worst?!   Even in none dwarf themed decks he is a great support hero. Low threat, 2 WP, moderate hp and an ability to save the game from deadly shadow effects!

 

 

LORE:

Beravor - Wingfoot on her gets you 2 WP each turn and someone gets to draw 2 additional cards each turn.  And card draw is king.

Treebeard - Great for every phase of the game.  Self-preservation and Ent Draugh make this beast into a machine.  Lembas is also fantastic if you can swing it.

Elrond - great stats paired with resource matching and increased healing as well as access to Vilya.

 

WORST:

Bombur, Faramir and Glorfindel - Of these three, I have only tried to use Faramir, but his high starting threat works directly against his desire to leave enemies in the staging area.

 

NOTE: My personal favorite Lore heroes are Damrod and Haldir, but Damrod requires enemies that can be trapped and Haldir requires tactics weapons to be of any worth.

I've almost never used Treebeard hero in pure solo, but maybe I should give him a try (and forget about his ally version.... huh... what??).

I agree that Legolas is a great Hero and he would be my #4 in my list but I find Tactigorn just so good and Ally Legolas is also great so I dont use him as much as I used to.

 

I really want to like the Beorn card and want to make a deck that makes him viable but alas there is always a better option. So I can understand why you place him last.

 

I agree it is hard to choose a Worst Leadership Hero there is no real clear cut crappy hero. Halbarad is actually decent when you pair him up with Damrod just snare an enemy and you have +2 Willpower every turn and the ability to optionally engage twice is good as well. 

 

I am going to have to try out TBoromir, Galadriel, Balin and Beravor you have provided compelling reasons for them being good. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

 

> I've almost never used Treebeard hero in pure solo, but maybe I should give him a try (and forget about his ally version.... huh... what??).

 

A Friend I play LOTR with also loves ally Treebeard and resisted playing the hero version but once he played a few games with him he swears by him now. So try him out a few times.

## 12 [Slothgodfather on August 22, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228077-differing-opinions/?do=findComment&comment=2378797)

My ent deck was for group play, but I liked Beregond, Mablung and Treebeard.  Get Mablung the Song ASAP.  Also, you can generally spend all your resources each turn as you'll gain one during the Engagement phase in order to play Boomed and Trumpeted.   That card is BEAST.   And if I understand the timing right you can use Treebeard's ability after you declare him as an attacker - then play the event - so for that attack he is extra pissed off and is also Ready for another attack.

 

@Zazoo - I currently am running a Berevor, Theodred, Galadriel support deck for a 4 player group.   I run Victory Display Manipulation, Side quests, a few cancels with Test of Will, Quick Ears and the Door is Closed, topped off with about 15 attachments that I plan to put on everyone else.   Being an enabler is a lot of fun and it helps make the others get more out of their cards as well.

 

Yea, I agree that Legolas doesn't get included in our decks as often due to his Ally version offering card draw, but he is still a better hero than his other Ranged competitors.  Mainly due to his trait and weapon selection.  Sure Elf-friend solves that, but Tactics already requires 2 cards (Foe Hammer + Weapon) to get card draw.  If you now add + Elf-Friend to that, it is a slow slog if you don't get those pieces early.

 

@Rajam - I can see giving up Mablung for Hama.  The resource acceleration is great, but Foe-Hama and Thicket of Spears-Hama have won us more games than I can count.

> Dori

i really don't get all the hate on Dori. i think people get too hung up on his ability and ignore the fact that he's a 2/5 sentinel dwarf for 10 threat

his ability is a bonus. it has niche uses (i could go on forever about how niche uses shouldn't be a metric for overall usefulness given the nature of this game), but it's especially nice in multiplayer games and/or games with one big baddie (Laketown, anyone?) instead of an army of them

that said, i would say that Brand, Son of Bain is the only other Tactics hero in the running for 'worst' since they're all so **** good, so i won't argue too strongly against someone who ultimately decides that Dori is the worst

as for Treebeard, i have a monosphere Lore deck with Rossiel, victory display manipulation stuff (Keen as Lances ftw) and whole mess of Ent allies, and Treebeard really helps with the early game aggression so the deck can start steamrolling once it gets going

I was wondering how long before you noticed.  Who do you think are the best/worst Tactics heroes?

## 16 [chrsjxn on August 23, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228077-differing-opinions/?do=findComment&comment=2379655)

The way I see it, every hero that gives you cards or resources is top tier. They end up fitting in slightly different places depending on exactly how they generate these things, but they're all amazing. (Eg, Grima is not a great resource accelerator for multiplayer, generally, but he is incredibly flexible.)

 

And there are a few heroes with incredibly powerful effects that belong in the same rank. Boromir because trivial readying allows him to double/triple/more dip on stat boosts. Elrond and Gandalf with huge resource flexibility + more. Caldara for super ally mustering. Dain for the global stat boost.

## 17 [DurinVoronwe on August 23, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228077-differing-opinions/?do=findComment&comment=2380010)

I think Beorn is a good hero. I use him in a ent deck (Bifur, Beorn, Cirdan), and he is awesome for early game, when the ents is weak. If he dies fast, then that is sad, but not terrible. He was vital for many newer quests, even Helms Deep! Maybe Boromir could have filled the same role, but Boromir needs to be built around. I included zero cards to support Beorn, and even alone he slaughtered many Urúk-Hai.

## 18 [Slothgodfather on August 23, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228077-differing-opinions/?do=findComment&comment=2380514)

@Durin - so who would you put at worst in the tactics category?

## 19 [dalestephenson on August 23, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228077-differing-opinions/?do=findComment&comment=2380601)

Worst tactics heroes:

 

Thalin against the Uruk-Hai

Brand and Bard in a solo deck.

TaTheoden as tactics splash.

Dori in a solo deck with Beregond.

Elladan without Elrohir at the table.

Hama without tactics events.

Eomer without disappearing allies or chump blockers

Mablung or Merry or Aragorn, with Damrod and Haldir

Gimli with Cold from Angmar in play

Legolas in Helm's Deep.

Beregond or Beorn, third stage of Redhorn Gate

Eowyn, in a Caldara deck

Boromir with Local Trouble attached.

 

Tactics may be the sphere where solo vs multiplayer has an effect on the largest number of heroes.  Bard and Brand might as well have blank boxes in solo play, and the other ranged/sentinel heroes are more at home there.  Boromir's power shines best in solo, as does Eowyn and Theoden's power IMO.  Elladan constricts hero choice the most by requiring his brother.  Eomer is probably the most restrictive in what kind of deck you're constructing.  Boromir probably wants the most deck space for his personal benefit.

 

Of all the tactics hero, Thalin is the one whose text is directly opposed to his stats, and TaTheoden and Dori are the only two whose utility is not immediately obvious, IMO.

> Dori is the worst tactics hero period

 

I disagree with this statement.  I'd put Thalin on the worst list over Dori, easily.

## 22 [fbnaulin on August 23, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228077-differing-opinions/?do=findComment&comment=2381091)

I think Thalin is very good in multiplayer, specially 3-4 players. You can make him even stronger with Fresh Tracks, Expecting Mischief and Anborn, and off course along with the brand new hero Argalad.

However, if the enemies health points keep growing in each cycle, he will be almost useless at some point.

 

By the way, I like Dori, really, he is a very good defender and pretty nice Sentinel for dwarves.

Galadriel is amazing even without all those toys. +1 vote for her being the best spirit hero

## 25 [Slothgodfather on August 23, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228077-differing-opinions/?do=findComment&comment=2381226)

@fbnaulin - I like Thalin a lot as well, but if I have to toss someone under the bus, it would be him before Dori.  His ability is conflicting with his marginal stats.     

 

I know with most heroes, a case can be made where they are the best hero/choice for a specific deck or scenario.  But Thalin's usefulness is mostly declining as enemies get stronger.   Which is the same negative to Beorn.   I can at least use other cards to enhance the effects of Thalin.  I really can't with Beorn - which is why he's my first choice for worst.   

 

I'd put Arwen as the best spirit hero since she doesn't actually require any tools to improve upon.   Sure, once Galadriel has gotten setup, she is better, but that setup makes her slightly weaker (imo) than Arwen.

I must be doing something wrong because I find that Galadriel is not great and makes the first few turns very difficult because she cannot contribute to questing, defending or attacking.

One you get past that she is great though.

 

As much as I dont want to, I would say that Glorfindel is the most used Spirit hero. My favourite Spirit hero would have to be Arwen.

## 27 [Crabble on August 24, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228077-differing-opinions/?do=findComment&comment=2382215)

I would disagree and still see Galadriel as the better. She is great at the start to get you some cards and needed thread reduction and don't forget: Every ally you get into play will quest for free! So even if you play some chump like Envoy of Pelargir that ally will quest and get you a defense. So she is quite good for the early game to fend of early enemy attacks and let you establish your board presence AND she scales waaay better into the late game then Arwen does. It's a close call but I would give Galadriel the slight edge over Arwen.

 

So back to topic, for me the choices by sphere would be:

 

Leadership:

Best: 1st: Denethor 2nd: Armathiul 3rd: tie between Imrahil and Sam

First two are simply the most used heroes in Leadership for me right now because you get soo much out of them. Denethor get's you resources very fast and spreads them just where you need them + he can defend if you manage to get him a shield. Armathiul + Armored Destrier + Captain of Gondor is a combat powerhouse beside the fact you get a "free" second sphere icon +  some resource acceleration on him! 3rd is tied because I think Sam is better but I use Imrahil more (yes I admit I like to chumpblock from time to time ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] )

Worst: Theodred

Theodred would be tied with Balin for me but since Denethor is out there is no use for Theodred anymore (at least for me).

 

Tactics:

Best: 1st: Legolas 2nd: Beregond 3rd: Eomer

Legolas is just the best. He is great even if he's your only tactics hero in the deck and his single hero progress making is unmatched! In the end you only win by making progress and Legolas shines in that matter + he kills of your enemies! Beregond is 2nd in there because he is just the greatest defender in this game. Get him a shield and he is set to defend. Third one is most likely a personal choice but I just like the Eomer playstyle. Chump with some cheap weekling and strike back hard with Eomer on Firefoot.:) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Worst: Dori

Two hero actions just to get a defense with +2?! Sorry not a deal for me...

 

Spirit:

Best: 1st: Galadriel 2nd: Arwen 3rd: tiw between Caldara and Glorfindel

Galadriel is just so powerful because you get a free action out of every ally you play in his first turn and she can keep your thread low and gets you card + access to lore "for free". That combination puts her (at least for me) above Arwen witch is really great too. Core for the Noldor stuff and generates resources in spirit without the Stargaizer+Zigi combo. Third is a tie because Caldara deck just got real with the latest stuff and my version of the Galadriel/Arwen/Caldara deck is my favorite deck to play right now. But as much as I'm sick of Glorfindel, his spirit hero version is just mind-blowing for 5! thread + his toys (Light/Asfaloth). Perfect match for Legolas too because he can use the same kind of weapons and you get questing + attack so only some defense out of your third hero is needed. But also very splas hable because he just has 5 thread (+ Light of Valinor is access able) witch allows you to use two "big" heroes in conjunction with him.

Worst: Fatty and Piipin

Both heroes are just really really really bad and have rightfully taken top spots in the worst hero contest in this forum!

 

Lore:

Best: 1st: Elrond 2nd: Rossiel 3rd: tie between Haldir and Pippin

Elrond has just such good stats and can get you anything you want with Vilya so clear choice for Nr. 1. Since I don't play much lore I go on with heroes I simply play the most and there comes Rossiel in at second place. I love my Rossiel secrecy deck and think that if you play her correctly a secrecy deck including her stuff + Hobbit-Gandalf really shines in multiplayer. Third choice is again a tie because Haldir pairs really well as a single hero in any deck that has access to some tactics weapons and Pippin is very splash able too. He get's you cards, low thread and two willpower for questing witch is a good all around package. But as I said Lore is my least favorite sphere so I don't play a lot of lore heroes.

Worst: probably Grima

I played him in a solo grief deck, didn't like it because there was no punsh in it and since then Grima is unused. Just not a good hero in multiplayer (which I play the most) and statwise he is weak for 9 thread.

## 28 [DurinVoronwe on August 24, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228077-differing-opinions/?do=findComment&comment=2382290)

My worst tactics hero is in solo Dori and in multiplayer... maybe Beorn or Eowyn or Thalin. None of them is bad though, and I love them all.

## 29 [dalestephenson on August 24, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228077-differing-opinions/?do=findComment&comment=2382864)

The OP used a best/worst criteria that amounted to like-to-play, though he clearly likes to play more powerful heroes.  Like to play is very subjective, but we can easily count the number of pages for a published deck with a given hero (yes, this includes multiple versions of the same deck).  At a minimum, this can give a clue for what heroes we like to publish decks for.  Instead of being listed by number of pages, I list in order of release.

 

Let's start with Tactics heroes:

 

7 Legolas

4 Gimli

4 Thalin

1 Brand

4 Boromir

3 Elladan

4 Hama

3 Beorn

5 Beregond

2 Bard

1 Theoden

3 Eomer

5 Merry

4 Mablung

4 Aragorn

1 Dori

2 Eowyn

 

Most unpopular are Brand, Theoden, and Dori, whose decks all fit on one page.  Bard and Eowyn are on two pages, though given Eowyn's recent release two pages isn't bad at all.  At three pages we have Eomer, Beorn, and Elladan.  Meanwhile, on the popular side Legolas is the favorite from the core set, with Beregond and Merry as the favorite from the expansions.

## 30 [dalestephenson on August 24, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228077-differing-opinions/?do=findComment&comment=2382883)

Repeating the same exercise for Leadership heroes:

 

7 Theodred

6 Aragorn

2 Gloin

3 Prince Imrahil

5 Dain

3 Elrohir

2 Thorin Oakenshield

3 Boromir

2 Balin

3 Hirluin the Fair

2 Celeborn

6 Sam Gamgee

2 Erkenbrand

3 Halbarad

4 Amarthiul

3 Faramir

6 Denethor

2 Elfhelm

 

Denethor is *very* popular despite his recent release, matching Sam's six page count for the expansion high.  Theodred leads among the core.  No one-page heroes here, even the very recent Elfhelm has made it to the second page, but he's joined there by Erkenbrand, Celeborn, Balin, Thorin, and Gloin.  Least popular has to go to Gloin, since he has the potential to be in the most decks.  And obviously it doesn't pay to be a dwarf.

Here's the counts for lore heroes:

 

7 Beravor

3 Denethor

1 Glorfindel

2 Bilbo Baggins

5 Bifur

6 Aragorn

8 Elrond

3 Ori

1 Bombur

3 Mirlonde

2 Faramir

3 Grima

4 Haldir of Lorien

7 Pippin

3 Treebeard

2 Rossiel

4 Erestor

4 Damrod

2 Galdor of the Havens

 

Elrond tops all, but Beravor and Pippin both reach 7 pages.  Meanwhile, Bombur and Glorfindel reach just one page, with Bilbo, Faramir, Rossiel, and the relatively recent Galdor on two pages.  Poor overshadowed Glorfindel has to take the nod as least popular.

## 32 [dalestephenson on August 24, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228077-differing-opinions/?do=findComment&comment=2382927)

And finally spirit heroes:

 

10 Eowyn

3 Dunhere

3 Eleanor

4 Frodo Baggins

1 Dwalin

11 Glorfindel

2 Nori

2 Oin

1 Pippin

2 Caldara

2 Idraen

1 Fatty Bolger

7 Galadriel

3 Theoden

4 Merry

11 Arwen

4 Cirdan

1 Lanwyn

1 Beregond

 

Spirit is clearly the most boom and bust for heroes.  Glorfindel and Arwen top the expansions at 11 pages, core Eowyn is just behind at 10 pages, and Galadriel has a healthy 7 pages.  At the other end, there's five heroes with only one page and another four with just two pages.  In the case of Beregond I think the lack of decks is temporary, though he certainly hasn't been embraced with the speed of TaEowyn, let alone LeDenethor.

 

Since he doesn't fall into any of the spheres, I'll note that hero Gandalf has 5 pages of decks.  (His OHUH ally has six pages, and his core ally has 42 pages.)

## 33 [Seastan on August 24, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228077-differing-opinions/?do=findComment&comment=2383233)

My personal taste. Since it's hard to compare heroes that are supposed to do different things, I broke it down into 3 categories:

 

1. Power. The hero that is the main driving force behind a top tier power deck.

2. Splashability. The hero that is the best choice to splash in a deck to get access to that hero's sphere. Because of this, they end up in a lot of decks.

3. Resources. I value resource generation so highly that if a hero contributes to it, they get a spot in my top 3.

 

Tactics

Top 3:

Boromir (power)

Eowyn (splashability)

Mablung (resources)

Honorable mention: Hama (broken)

 

Bottom 1:

Theoden (forces an archetype that has not been supported until recently)

 

Dori didn't make the bottom 1 because he can be marginally useful in combination with Beregond against boss quests.

 

Spirit

Top 3:

Caldara (power)

Glorfindel (splashability)

Arwen (resources)

Honorable mention: Galadriel (mainly the Mirror)

 

Bottom 1:

Pippin (he'd probably be less hated with a blank text box, so that should tell you something)

Honorable mention: Dwalin (too quest-specific)

 

Leadership

Top 3:

Dain (power)

Sam (splashability)

Denethor (resources)

Honorable mention: Theodred (resources)

 

Bottom 1:

Imrahil (same ability as a 2-cost attachment, and actually requires you to sacrifice your board state to use it)

 

Lore

Top 3:

Elrond (power)

Bifur (splashability)

Grima (resources)

Honorable mention: Beravor/Erestor (card draw)

 

Bottom 1:

Faramir (his high threat works against his own ability)

Honorable mention: Rossiel (in my opinion, a victory display deck works best without her, making her counter to her own purpose)

Hm interesting, why would you say that Rossiel doesn't work in a victory display deck? She can pay for these cards, has low starting thread and with a Light of Valinor she can be used in questing and defending where she benefits the most (+4 stats in total) out of locations and enemies in the discard pile that in most quests share common traits with other locations and enemies.

## 35 [zazoo on August 25, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228077-differing-opinions/?do=findComment&comment=2383845)

As I said initially it is great to see what others think and where the differences are.

So far there are a lot of similar opinions but not one of us has the same selections.

 

Just to clarify my selections are the first Heroes I reach for when designing a deck, and considering I almost always play multiplayer that will influence my selection.

 

Seastan had a very good point regarding resource generation, every hero that has some sort of resource generation is a top tier hero.

## 36 [dalestephenson on August 25, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228077-differing-opinions/?do=findComment&comment=2383992)

Rossiel benefits from victory display cards, but victory card displays do not benefit from Rossiel.

 

As an example, I played (two-player) with a Rossiel deck in Dwarrowdelf, with a starting threat of 19 for a first-turn Out of the Wild.  When we played it, you had to make a choice between taking out the most obnoxious card and the card that most benefitted Rossiel.  Without Rossiel, there'd be no thought of putting an otherwise unremarkable goblin or underground/dark location in the victory display, but with Rossiel that's usually what we did.

## 37 [Crabble on August 25, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228077-differing-opinions/?do=findComment&comment=2383999)

Then you play her wrong ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] Don't get me wrong I mean no offense but with Out of the Wild you normally hope for some nasty treachery to get rid of. Leave No Trace and Non Return are there to get you enemies and locations into the victory display.

## 38 [dalestephenson on August 25, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228077-differing-opinions/?do=findComment&comment=2384048)

I was always hoping that Hidden Pitfall would show up for my Out of the Wild play, but it never did.  I hate that card.

 

I'm not convinced I played her wrong, being able to defend or quest for 4 from the beginning for most of the quest was extremely powerful.  My point is simply that what benefits *Rossiel* isn't necessarily the same as what makes the deck weaker.  That's also true when you're using Leave No Trace or None Return, though in that case there's seldom a choice to be made.

Which is precisely why I don't like her. She doesn't help you quest through locations until you've already quested through some, and she doesn't help you defend against enemies until you've already defended and killed some.

## 40 [monkeyrama on August 25, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228077-differing-opinions/?do=findComment&comment=2384168)

I've had a lot of success with Rossiel in a saga campaign (she replaced Haldir after he died to kill the Balrog). One reason she has been so handy is that so many saga quests put locations into the victory display, often with corresponding traits to ones in the deck. I have found in other situations that without the right cards out she can be slightly dead. But she's mostly there because she's the right threat level (although I sometimes wonder if Mirlonde wouldn't work just as well).

## 41 [Authraw on August 25, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228077-differing-opinions/?do=findComment&comment=2384210)

The trouble I've had with Rossiel has always been actually getting good use out of her stats, specifically her defense.

 

The problem usually goes something like this: If I'm going full-on victory display deck, I want to be able to recur the events, which suggests Scroll of Isildur. Scroll of Isildur suggests mono-Lore. Out of the Wild suggests secrecy, but Lore doesn't have much in the way of threat reduction, so I've got to start low, probably Pippin and Mirlonde.

 

But now I don't have any combat stats. I have to defend and kill something to turn Rossiel into my defender, but I can't do that with the stats I have, so I'm stuck. Even after that, I don't have the combat power to kill enemies after I pull them down. If I include some better attackers (like Haldir, I guess?) I'm mostly giving up on Out of the Wild (3 cost is pretty steep). My better bet is probably to give up on mono-Lore--maybe swap in Spirit Glorfindel for Mirlonde, and give up on Scroll of Isildur. And now I get Light of Valinor for Rossiel, which lets her use both her Willpower and her Defense! Except that I probably want LoV for Glorfindel instead, and those events are pretty expensive for not actually advancing your board state, so maybe I need to splash Leadership too for some resource acceleration, and man I wish I could put Elven Mail on Rossiel but that would require Tactics...

 

And then I replace Rossiel with Denethor and just build a full-on support deck.

## 42 [dalestephenson on August 25, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228077-differing-opinions/?do=findComment&comment=2384255)

I played Rossiel mono-lore in fellowship with a tri-sphere deck, so getting access to Light of Valinor for Rossiel wasn't too hard.  Killing things with the Rossiel deck was more problematic if the Ents were slow to arrive, since I didn't have good ranged attack in the other deck.  For Rossiel mono-lore solo, Out of the Wild is expensive if you don't start Mirlonde/Pippin/Rossiel, but Pippin at least gives you access to A Good Meal to reduce it and any other events.  Rossiel/Pippin/SpMerry also starts in secrecy, can stay in secrecy, and Rossiel can get LoV without competition, but again you are reliant on allies for attack.

## 43 [dalestephenson on August 25, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228077-differing-opinions/?do=findComment&comment=2384260)

And as I noted above, I used Out of the Wild to buff Rossiel *before* killing or exploring.  That's when Out of the Wild is cheap, and turning Rossiel into an excellent defender or quester was worth more to me than making the encounter deck easier (unless there is a card I really, really hate in the five.)  I mulliganed for Out of the Wild.

## 44 [Slothgodfather on August 25, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228077-differing-opinions/?do=findComment&comment=2384330)

>  I want to be able to recur the events, which suggests Scroll of Isildur. Scroll of Isildur suggests mono-Lore.

 

Just a note, the 2 core Victory display manipulation cards (Leave no Trace and None Return) both go to the Victory display themselves after being played, so there is no way to repeat them.   You could repeat out of the Wild, but I tend to leave that out of my Victory Display Manipulation decks due to cost and lack of secrecy.  

 

I had used Rossiel for awhile and she can be really good to easy keep 4 WP questing in each turn in a support deck, but it is very encounter deck dependent.  The locations need to share a trait a LOT of the time.   I had used her for awhile in the a fellowship group, but another players Legolas wouldn't let us keep an active location!  

 

Something I'd like to see to help make Victory Display manipulation better - which it is already really good in a support deck - would be to get some attachment that gained a benefit for the number of non-victory cards in the victory display.   It would have to come with a limit to avoid abuse.

 

 

Also, I really like how many times someone puts a hero on their list, and the next person puts them in the exact opposite category.

this is how my mono lore victory display deck works. no Out of the Wild at all. no Scroll of Isildur either.

just 3x Leave No Trace, 3x None Return, 1x Scout Ahead, 2x The Door is Closed!, and of course 3x Keen as Lances

well it is the differing opinions thread after all lol

also as an aside, i had typed out this really long list of who i thought were my favourites and least favourites and the forums just ate it lol

here's my list without explanation cos i don't want to type it all out again

Leadership:

Amarthiul

Denethor

Theodred

least:

Boromir

Tactics

Mablung

Beregond

Hama

(one of them will likely be replaced by Imrahil and/or Eowyn)

least:

Gimli (yeah, i said it)

Spirit

Eowyn

Theoden

Arwen

Beregond has a shot on here

least:

Pippin (i actually even like Fatty for a mono blue Hobbitses deck since he can defend a bit)

Lore

Erestor

Galdor

Damrod

least:

don't really play Lore that much, but i don't like Bilbo and Grima for being much worse for multiplayer (where i think the game really shines), so i pretty much never use them

## 46 [Slothgodfather on August 25, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228077-differing-opinions/?do=findComment&comment=2384984)

I dislike Gimli as well.  I wouldn't say he is the worst, but I can't fault you that opinion.  I never use him either.  

## 47 [dalestephenson on August 25, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228077-differing-opinions/?do=findComment&comment=2385067)

I've played almost all the quests with a Eowyn/Gimli/Thalin deck (descended from the second deck in Beorn's Path), and I think of it as "the Gimli deck".  He's easy to ramp up and doesn't require much in the way of card support, and it's just fun to kill stuff.  However, he's more of a "miscellaneous attacking hero" than part of any particular tribal or combo deck, and most of the other attacking heroes do have some synergy with particular kinds of decks.  His get-banged-up-then-attack makes him most similar to Beorn as a hero, I think.

> I dislike Gimli as well.  I wouldn't say he is the worst, but I can't fault you that opinion.  I never use him either.

i think it's also important to note that Tactics has the most consistently-useful heroes of any sphere imo

if i were to pick say a bottom 3 list, i'd much more easily pick it for Leadership, Spirit, and Lore and would have trouble with Tactics

even the worst Tactics hero is better than many other heroes of the other spheres

## 49 [Slothgodfather on August 26, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228077-differing-opinions/?do=findComment&comment=2386305)

Well know I'm curious what would be everyone's 3 worst for each sphere.  Here is my list:

 

Leadership: 

Halbarad - While the 2/2/2 stat-line can be versatile, I find his traits keep him from being "good" lacking synergy with Gondor or Noldor/Silvan attachments/events. He has a built in action advantage, however you likely have to use it defending against the enemy you keep engaged with you (baring Forest Snare), so you really aren't gaining anything.  Without an enemy engaged, he quests for 2.  With an enemy engaged, he quests for 2 and then likely has to defend against said enemy.  Net gain of a risky shadow card.  Not worth it.  His other ability is too situational and often useless.

Faramir - I'm normally a big fan of abilities that give ready characters, but his threat/keyword for lack luster stats is off putting.  Again, his traits hamper his effectiveness due to no good/reliable weapons.  As a ranged character, his other stats are not really relevant, making them a waste vs his threat cost.  High threat hampers the use of Dagger of Westernesse, the only weapon he can use to get +2 attack without Elf-Friend.

Elfhelm - He's only on her because he seems like he would be terrible for solo play and takes a fair amount of coordination for group play.  Granted, some mounts - such as Rohan Warhorse - are used often in Fellowships, but I'm not sure that alone is worth taking up an entire Hero slot for no other gains.  

 

Spirit:

Fatty - well all know it.

Pippin - this is a given as well.

Dwalin - simply because I had to put a third on here.  He works for thematic decks and against the right scenario but is the most situational.  Oin is close behind but isn't encounter specific.  

 

Lore:

Bombur - sure you can make use of him in thematic decks, but he's still one of the worst Lore has to offer

Faramir - talk about a conflict of interests!   High threat, mid-ling stats, ranged and a buff that is counter to high-threat...  He is also in the way of Ally Faramir.

Glorfindel - Sure, easy access to Asfolof, but that is not worth that starting threat or garbage ability.  

 

Tactics: 

Beorn - I feel like with his 1 shield and immunity, against today's high damage monsters or nightmare quests, he isn't as useful as I'd want in a hero.   I will admit I need to use him more to better judge, but I have played with the other tactics heroes a lot and find them reliable, so he makes the cut.

Brand son of Bain - Sure, he's got a built in standing ability, but it is only useful if that other player has multiple enemies engaged and his single trait is restrictive to good attachments.

Thalin - He is fun to use to clip every enemy that comes out, but often that 1 damage doesn't amount to much.  Without Dain, his 1 WP isn't much either.  He is good for killing ravens, but that's about it.

I think the value of Brand's ability is directly proportional to the exhaust abilities on the deck he's helping.  I paired Brand in a fellowship opposite a Three Rings deck, so even if there was only one enemy to destroy, he could ready Galadriel for her ability or Elrond for Vilya or Gandalf for Word of Command.  Allies like Gleowine are also excellent.

It's like dr00 said, each tactics hero really does have his place.  I still feel those three are the worst of them.   I agree Brand's ability gets a lot more useful with what he is paired with - who would you put lower on the list for tactics heroes?

I don't think there are any actually bad tactics heroes, but I think these are my least favorites:

 

Elladan -- he has to be paired with his brother for his readying ability to be worth anything, and when he's with his brother I think his brother is far more valuable.  If you have repeatable solid defense, repeatable offense isn't so important -- tactics can muster killing power easily and unlike defending you don't have to do it alone.

Thalin -- his ability forces him to quest, but his questing isn't very good.  I don't like when abilities work against their stats.

Brand -- it's no shame for a hero to better multiplayer than solo, and lots of tactics heroes fit that description -- but I don't like having a main ability that is *absolutely worthless* to one-deck solo players.  At least Bard's *almost* useless ability can still shine in solo with a Great Yew Bow.  Brand in solo is a 2/3/2/3 tactics hero with blank text and the worthless Dale keyword.

## 53 [dr00 on August 27, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228077-differing-opinions/?do=findComment&comment=2387122)

for tactics, i'd say:

Thalin - stats work against ability, but the main thing that bugs me is the developers realised fairly early on how powerful his ability was and started adding weird effects to counteract him, like Toughness, making him almost necessary for some quests like Return to Mirkwood and completely useless in later quests

Brand - compared to Bard, i like Bard better, but i feel that there's fairly similar in that they're hard to utilise to their full potential.  Bard gets the nod for being absolutely amazing with Tactics Merry though

Gimli - i didn't type out my rationale before, but basically, he needs a lot of support to get going, otherwise (or even with support) he's a high risk scenario with not necessarily a high reward, when you could just play some allies or attachments to help with attacking power.  plus, he's still a liability, even when there isn't much to attack.  Gloin is a dwarf with a similar ability who can actually be healed, unlike Gimli, who loses his boosts if he gets healed.

 

 

for the others:

 

Leadership:

Boromir: i always find that when i want to make a Gondor-themed deck, i end up just making things like Guard of the Citadel not terrible for their cost, but only if i can get all of my support pieces.  and some Gondorian allies work against the trait and are better within their sphere, like Pelargir Shipwright.  i also find that, in the end, Outlands just does it a lot better and can build itself with all the pieces you find.

Halbarad:  i actually really like his ability to quest while engaged, but optionally engaging two enemies is useless, and Amarthiul just does this so much better if you want to stay engaged with enemies

Faramir:  i like ally Faramir much more than any other Faramir, so all of them will be inferior imo.  i also find that not many allies worth playing are worth readying when you would typically engage an enemy.  combined with Aragorn, Mablung, or something, could be something there, but again, not many allies are worth the readying effect.  that said, i've included him in an Outlands deck, and it's not terrible (he's likely getting completely replaced with Imrahil when City of Corsairs comes out though)

 

 

Tactics: (above)

 

 

Spirit:

 

Pippin - there's just nothing redeemable at all whatsoever except that you can do a mono-spirit Hobbit deck while still using fellowship Frodo for the saga quests.

Fatty Bolger - i actually like Fatty a lot and how he can work with Spirit Merry (and Hobbit ponies can get them to quest if they aren't needed), but until you get a Hobbit Pony, it's useless, and even then, only really helpful in multiplayer, not that helpful, etc. etc.

Dwalin - Nori exists.  also only works on certain quests/enemies, and lowering your threat is often a way to avoid conflict, but his ability only works if you're actively engaging/killing things, so i'm not sure how useful the threat reduction really is, unless you're able to keep yourself below secrecy.  again, only works on Orc enemies though

 

 

Lore:

 

Grima:  i know he's in the top for a lot of lists, but i find him a huge liability for multiplayer (where i think the game truly shines).  he's also one of only two Rohan-themed Lore cards, which annoys me to no end, even if it does make sense that he wouldn't exactly be helpful in a Rohan-themed deck

Bilbo:  great for solo-deck single player.  less and less useful after that, and his threat is super high for his super low stats.  he doesn't synergise well with hobbit-themed decks either, especially since ally Bilbo is so good in that regard

Glorfindel:  i just...  meh.

My strongest 3 picks in no particular order and not including fun factor.

Tactics:

Legolas

Boromir

Beregond

Worst: Dori. Almost useless. He needs a attachment. Bad.

Leadership:

Erkenbrand

Denethor

Dain

Worst: None are really bad. But if I had to pick....Halbarad I guess.

Spirit:

Arwen

Glorfindel

Cirdan

Worst: pippin. He just sux so much donkey butts it is mesmerizing.

Lore:

Elrond

Aragorn

Erestor

Worst:

Faramir. Not unplayable, but what were they thinking designing him???

He could have so good in a trap deck with the right stat line & threat. Shame.

To me:

 

The best tactics: Legola

The worst tactics: Brand

 

The best leadership: Sam

The worst leadership: Halbarad

 

The best lore: Pippin

The worst lore: Grima

 

The best spirit: Frodo

The worst spirit: Dwalin

 

3 hobbits are the best options between the 4 spheres: the best trait --> HOBBiTS ^^

Grima worst Lore? You play multi-player only?

## 57 [Mndela on August 27, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228077-differing-opinions/?do=findComment&comment=2388041)

Yes, 98% is multiplayer (80% of them 3 players at least)

## 58 [zazoo on August 29, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228077-differing-opinions/?do=findComment&comment=2389526)

My Take on the worst in each sphere.

 

Leadership: 

Halbarad - I have played a deck with him and he did ok, but he is niche and again there are better options.

Faramir - I think he is counter intuitive, ranged but wants to engage?!

Prince Imrahil - He's on here because leadership does not have a lot of bad heroes and there are too many other options that are better. I have never used him in a deck and doubt I ever will.

 

After all the comments here I am seeing the use for Balin so he no longer on my bad list.  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

Spirit:

Fatty - I dont think I will every use him

Pippin - Same

Dwalin - simply because I had to put a third on here.

 

Lore:

Bilbo Baggins - For 1 threat more you get Beravor and she is just so much better.

Faramir - He is again counter intuitive

Glorfindel - He has a great stat line but there are always better healing options that what he provides so never finds a place.

 

Tactics: 

Dori - Sure he has a place but it is far to niche and still not a great ability.

Brand son of Bain - I cant believe he is on this list but there are too many other options that are better so he is never used.

Beorn - I really like the idea but I always end up taking another hero instead.

Best spirit hero is Eleanor.

Treachery kills all your 1hp allies? Eleanor.

Treachery screws over your whole game? Eleanor.

No treachery? Eleanor with Blood of Numenor / Gondorian Shield defends, with Sword of Numenor / Gondorian Fire she can poke things and get resources (to pay for Blood or trigger Heir of Mardil, to poke more things).

Might as well put her on something like Arod so she can destroy locations too.

And thats for only 7 threat...

i find i don't user her often enough but feel that she is one of the most underrated heroes in the game, even for myself

 

now with Spirit Beregond, i may try to find a Tactics / Spirit deck that makes liberal use of Gondorian Shield

maybe Mablung as my third for resource acceleration (who can also benefit from the Shield)
