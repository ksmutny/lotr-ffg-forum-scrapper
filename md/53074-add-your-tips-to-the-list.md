see if we can get a big list of tips to help new comers (or constant losers like me!) here's mine

 

- 'even the smallest person can change the course of the game' powefull heros arent everything- attatchment cards can make even the weakest of heros formidable. Stick celebrians stone and favour of the lady on someone and they already ahve +3 willpower.

 

- bilbos extra card draw matched with eowyns ability to +1 willpower after discarding a card is very useful. with that extra card you can discard 1 per turn and still have a decent pool of cards
