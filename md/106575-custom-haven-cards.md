Hey guys, I've been having a lot of time in my hands lately and wanted to have fun in Photoshop creating this Haven cards according to my other thread. I like how they turned out, tempted to actually try them!

 

What do you think? Are they OP? Any suggestions or sites you'd like for me to make? There are still lots of sites I wanna make but I don't know how! Green number is the maximum number of allies you can play on that haven.

So far I've made trait-based Havens and while they're cool, I want to make more that are based on sphere in terms of requirements. So for example, Helm's Deep will require 2 tactics heroes, and so on, so they can be more splashable and not restricted to traits. Also, any ideas for Rivendell?

These actually look really cool. I wasn't feeling the idea 100% when you first mentioned it but I like the effects of Edoras especially.

I like the ideas here. I can see the value of making it so that you can still see the allies (face up not face down as I suggested before).

I still think the allies need to be completely out of play to balance these though. I also think they need a threat cost.

However the basic idea is really good - if I wanted to add a new player card type to the game a good locations card like these is where I would look first,and I think this idea has serious potential after refinement for exactly how it works and play testing.

Cool ideas! For the third haven, I'd add "(to a minimum of 1)" for the second bit of text.

## 5 [Gizlivadi on May 19, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/106575-custom-haven-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1089551)

Thanks all for the suggestions. So far the cards are just in experimental phase, but I think they're fairly balanced.

 

MOAR havens!

Wow, Orthanc Guard is actually playable in Orthanc... pretty cool

 

minastirith.png [http://s27.postimg.org/ctzo78oab/minastirith.png]

 

Minas Tirith in all of her splendor. Gondor deck is now a much more viable archetype.

Also, I decided to change the text on Edoras to the following since I thought the first one was a bit overpowered, but now I'm not so sure about it....

 

edoras.png [http://s23.postimg.org/h387j6kjv/edoras.png]

 

 

Now, about the threat cost... I agree that maybe there should be an additional cost to use these cards, but threat cost seems too harsh for some decks I believe. I'd like a more universal cost, or maybe a specific drawback for each Haven, as opposed to a general one.

 

I don't know if allies should be completely out of play... that would make these cards a bit too useless. I think one of the main reasons we play an ally is to either attack or chump block, and forbidding them to do that seems a good enough restriction. Not to say they are also forbidden to quest. I'd still like these allies to only be able to use their special abilities.

Beautiful cards and an idea that could work with a little playtesting for balance!

## 7 [Gizlivadi on May 19, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/106575-custom-haven-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1089606)

New ideas for future Havens: Lothlórien, Rivendell, Hobbiton, Bree, Pelargir, Dol Amroth, Esgaroth, Dale, Helm's Deep. Is there another one I'm missing?  

 

Also, changed the text on Erebor to: "While you control at least 5 dwarf characters (not including allies played in this Haven)...".

You could do Thranduil's Hall for Silvan Elves.

## 9 [Gizlivadi on May 19, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/106575-custom-haven-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1089680)

Yes, I forgot about that! I would like it to combo well with the new Silvan strategy of entering/leaving play. Any ideas? 

## 10 [legolas18 on May 19, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/106575-custom-haven-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1089702)

It could be something as simple as "Pay 1 resource to return an ally you control at Thranduil's Hall to you hand." That way, they get Celeborn's and Galadriel's benefits when they come back into play.

## 11 [Gizlivadi on May 19, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/106575-custom-haven-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1089708)

Thanks! I like it because it also triggers leaving play effects for other cards. Allies played on Havens are Immune to non-Haven card effects (except for their own), but they are still considered to be "in play". 

## 12 [Gizlivadi on May 19, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/106575-custom-haven-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1089713)

How about this? Does it look too powerful?

I can see a Silmarillion or Children of Húrin reader here. Nargothrond is quite fitting for Woodland Realm.

## 15 [Gizlivadi on May 20, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/106575-custom-haven-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1090786)

Now that I think of it, I'm not sure if I like the abilities being usable. But I think I'm just too in love with the idea of being able to use Zigil Miner in Erebor... though maybe for balance it would be a little overpowered. The thing is, I want that ally specifically to be in the Haven, which makes it very thematic... Like Erestor in Rivendell, for instance. Maybe the ally should just become a number to fill in the card, but the idea feels boring.

 

But keeping on with these rules, any ideas for Rivendell? That's the one that is absolutely impossible for me to make, lol

Rivendell tends to be a place of escape, rest, and/or counsel. So I would make some sort of readying and/or willpower boosting and/or threat reducing effect. It would match well with Elrond's Counsel too, which seems fitting for Rivendell.

bree.png [http://s29.postimg.org/bmcuwfss7/bree.png]

 

In the village of Bree, the Rangers stand watch...

 

This would be the first one of the six "dual" sphere Havens I will make. You need a hero from each of the Haven's spheres in order to control them, and you can only play allies from those spheres in the Haven. I thought Bree would be a nice choice for Spirit-Leadership since that's (as of now) the sphere pair that represents the Rangers of the North. I tried to also make the ability related to both spheres, and Leadership and Spirit overlap in shadow cancelation.

 

Dol Amroth comes next, for Leadership and Tactics I'm thinking, maybe with some defense boosting effect. Still no ideas for Rivendell. I want that one to be the "catch all" Haven, and some ability that supports having multiple sphere allies and heroes.

 

Also, a minor (?) edit to all Haven cards: they now have the Unique symbol, which I had forgotten to put.

Perhaps yes for the ability, but only with a drawback? Like every time a character triggers his ability in a haven, something negative happens? I see it makes total sense for the Gazer, Erestor, Minstrels, Miners, to be in their havens, and since many of these have such abilities, it might be boring to just take them away.

## 19 [Gizlivadi on May 20, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/106575-custom-haven-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1091730)

The balance comes mainly (I hope) from the fact that you're basically losing a body on the table for questing and combat. There are very few allies I think that are obvious "Haven" allies (stargazer comes to mind but even she can chump block in a pinch), since most of them will have at least one stat that can be used, so there are many strategic choices to be made. Do I send Erestor with the heroes and have a good quested and decent defender or do I keep him safely in the Haven so he can draw cards? Now of course there are many decks that simply do not have allies with actions that you can take advantage of if played in the Haven, and that's why I decided to put special abilities on the Havens themselves so there's more of an advantage to playing allies there.

 

I like your idea of a negative effect for every time you trigger an ally's ability in a Haven. Maybe a threat increase? 

 

Now that I think of it, I'm not sure I can make five more dual-sphere Havens PLUS four mono-sphere havens. There are just not enough good locations in Middle Earth! Edhellond is a possibility, looking back at MECCG, but I'm not sure it was actually inhabited by the third age... Any suggestions, people?

The havens idea is nice in that I always thought it was weird to have these craftsmen or loremasters or healers tagging along in a big battle. All those poor masters of lore who have been stomped into the ground by trolls while they're trying to peer through their tomes!

## 21 [Gizlivadi on May 20, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/106575-custom-haven-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1091883)

Havens galore!

esgaroth.png [http://s18.postimg.org/spxnks8mx/esgaroth.png]

 

 

Okay, so here's what I'm thinking: you can use the abilities of only one ally in your Haven and only once per round, so you basically have to choose which one to use each turn. Does that sound better?

 

As for the rest of the havens, here are my ideas so far:

 

Lore-tactics: Rhosgobel

Lore-spirit: Lothlorien (I may also put an added bonus for elves played there)

 

Mono spirit: Pelargir

Mono tactics: Helm's Deep

Mono leadership: Dale

Mono lore: Rivendell (it seems I have no other option)

 

Also, Hobbiton will be for the hobbit deck.

 

As for the mono sphere Havens, I could make the requirement of 3 heroes of that sphere, or just 2. What do you think?

If you only want them for monosphere use 3 heroes, but only 2 is much more versatile. It depends on what you make their effects and how variable you want the heroes to be.

## 23 [Gizlivadi on May 21, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/106575-custom-haven-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1092295)

I want them to be more splashable, that's why I prefer 2 heroes.

I just playtested a bunch of these Havens against a scenario and was very surprised. Erebor was the only one that worked perfectly, a perferct balance between cost and benefit. The other Havens, though, were actually not really good at all. Their effects were not totally worth it, especially in the beggining, playing an ally in the Haven can actually be very crippling, even my Mono-leadership gondor deck struggled if I played an ally in Minas Tirith early on, and when its text became active, it was not useful at all since Gondor allies are all so wimpy anyway... it was just that their ffect was so minimal that it was just not worth it to play a cheap chumpblocker in the Haven to get it.. So I came with new abilities for some of them (Dunharrow, Minas Tirith, Edoras, Dol Amroth) and made the effects more interesting.

 

New versions:

 

Minas Tirith

limit of 4, A player must control at least 2 gondor heroes to control this haven. Restricted to Gondor allies. While each of your heroes has at least 1 resource in its resource pool, Minas Tirith gains "Action: exhaust 2 allies played here to choose a player. Each Gondor character controlled by that player gets +1 attack until the end of the phase (limit twice per round)"

 

Edoras

Limit 4, A player must control at least 2 Rohan heroes to control this Haven. Restricted to Rohan allies. Response: after a character leaves play, you may exhaust 3 allies played here to look at the rop 4 chards of your deck. Add 2 of theose ards to your hand and discard the others.

 

Dol Amroth

 

Limit 3, A player must control a Leadership and a Tactics hero to control this Haven. Leadership and Tactics heroes you control get +1 defense for each ally played here with a printed cost higher than 1 (to a limit of +2).

 

Dunharrow

 

Limit 3. A player must control a Spirit and a Tactics hero to control this Haven. Restricted to Spirit and Tactics allies. Response: After the players quest successfully, you may exhaust 2 allies played here to deal 2 damage to an enemy in the staging area.

 

 

Okay, so you can see that basically there Havens got a pretty big buff. They did. The ability of Dunharrow, for example, was a joke. It required an active location that had to be cleared, and an enemy in the staging area, which, if you already were high enough in threat, could be only one that had been just revealed from the encounter deck. And all the while I had spent a few valuable resources on allie that were ust going to be waiting there to be exhausted and it just never happened. Now it actually works, and without being overpowered. Same for Edoras. The effect was just never triggered and if it did, it was pretty insignificant. Now I have made the cost higher, but the potential benefit is higher as well. What do you think of the changes?

 

Also playtested Bree, and that one works just perfectly.

I think the idea of these is absolutely brilliant!

 

Are you thinking of continuing with the idea and tweaking what you have? I'm not sure whether you've quite got it right yet and balanced?.

 

I'm all for having these and sites like Beorn's House, Hobbiton etc (I'm a big MECCG fan!) in this brilliant game.

 

The artwork is stunning - where did you find them?

Hey my supposedly Welsh friend. No, I haven't continued this idea much further. I think I corrected some of the havens to be more playable, but really that's it. However, I think I could revisit this idea if there's people wanting to improve it and give suggestions. Maybe I could tweak the rules a bit, though I think they're fine as of now. But now that the traits have gotten some more development (especially silvan), I think a new batch of these could be good. If you're willing to help me make some more Havens with the places you're mentioning, that'd be awesome. I'm going out right now but later I can give you the Haven template I created. If you want to create your own Havens, you'll need photoshop.

## 30 [dragoncymru on December 29, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/106575-custom-haven-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1384711)

Hi there

 

Haven't got photoshop I'm afraid - so I'm an ideas man only - rather than graphic design.

 

Would it be possible to post the latest designs of all the ones you've done so that I'm up to speed?

 

From what I gather, this is the premise:

1. You have 1 Haven at the start of the game.

2. What Haven you have is independent of the quest but rather thematic of what heroes you have? Kind of 'where you come from'?

3. Havens give a bonus to play in some way. So if you play one, for balance, there must be a cost? A small threat cost would be obvious (say 1-3?) balance? Havens could reduce costs of Allies played there? Butterbur at Bree for example? Beorn and beornings  could play cheaper if Beorn's House is your Haven? Radagast at Rhosgobel?

4. You can play allies at Havens. If an Ally is at a Haven what does this mean? They cannot be attacked or defend? Can they Quest? Questing kind of makes sense as it can be Erestor's advice for example. But an Ally at a Haven is no affected by Treachery cards revealed I the Quest phase? Can Allies leave Havens to join you on the Quest (perhaps you have to pay 1 Resource to move them from haven to your party??) Allies at havens can still use abilities though?

 

is this about it?.

## 31 [Gizlivadi on December 30, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/106575-custom-haven-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1386359)

1: Yes

2: Yeah, kinda. It goes with your deck while not being part of it, like heroes, and represents where you come from. But it doesn't need to be thematic. If you're playing with Elladan and Elrohir but your deck works best if using Dol Amroth as a haven, then use it.

3: I think that losing the bodies on the table is enough of a drawback. The thing with havens is that you have to be very careful of when to play allies with your company or in the haven. You have to measure the cost and benefit of having the bonus later on if you can afford it or trying to reach it early if you need it. They are kinda like planeswalkers, in a way.

4: Allies in a haven cannot quest, attack or defend. They can, however, use their special abilities. Since the encounter cards and decks do not consider havens and characters played at them, they are considered non-existent, or out of play, by treachery cards, archery effects and the like, so that the rest of the game stays pretty much intact.  

 

I haven't thought of the possibility of allies leaving the haven to join you on the quest. That is interesting, and I could make a rule out of it, though I'd prefer if it was a neutral event that let you do that.

 

Another thing I haven't decided yet is whether allies played at havens are immune to play card effects or not. They can of course affect the game with their abilities, but I don't know if it is balanced or thematic if a ranger at Henneth Annun can shoot arrows at the staging area in Rohan, or throw rocks at enemies and such.

 

 

 

Also, suggestions for Helm's Deep? I'm making it now.

These are excellent!

 

I particularly like how you have captured Rivendell and the quote.

 

Can you squeeze a quote in for helm's Deep and Pelargir?

 

Can you repost the earlier ones like Bree etc - they still need their unique symbol and have you changed Edoras??

 

I can just see Lothlorien, Rhosgobel and Beorn's House to go??

 

Still think we need to nail what an Ally can or can't do at a Haven.

 

I also think that it should be a rule rather than a card that allows Allies to leave a haven and join you (or vice versa....??)

I'm going to make a file or gallery something like that to put up on the web so I don't post multiple versions of the same cards. I'll be making revised versions of the older havens as well as the new ones, since some of those were oriented towards decks that are heavy or even mono of that sphere, so I'll change the requirements to 2 heroes. Can anybody help me with creating an online gallery?

## 35 [dragoncymru on January 1, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/106575-custom-haven-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1388502)

A Gallery sounds like a good idea - not sure how to go about it though.

 

I think a few Havens can be heavy as long as they are thematic.

 

Would you consider multiple Havens (ie duplication- 2 different Rivendells for instance)) with different  abilities on each to give some player choice? I don't think many would do this but Rivendell is a contender perhaps?

## 36 [Gizlivadi on January 1, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/106575-custom-haven-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1388827)

Nah, I don't want to do multiple versions of one haven. I've already covered most sphere combinations as well as deck archetypes, so I don't feel it's necessary.
