I'm afraid not.

 

In almost all cases, if a card effect doesn't specify that its target can be somewhere other than "currently in play", then the target must be currently in play.

 

The only exception I can think of offhand is if a quest card says, for instance, "Caradhras becomes the active location" this applies no matter what zone Caradhras is currently in. Why this is an exception puzzles me, but I think the simplest reason is "they sometimes run out of space on quest cards".

I suspect it is because it is possible to get rid of that location while it is in staging area and it is quite probable that the location was "supposed" to be active at a certain point and the designers hadn´t taken into consideration that it might leave play.

Since then they have learned and simply put the phrase "immune to player card effects" on cards instead.

Just my 2 cents.
