Anyone knows why I can't read some letters in the topic titles or why my avatar is blank ? (I tried to get a new one but those on the list are blank as well :/)

this seems to be one of several issues.

i cannot see !!!! for instance. it was the same with the old forum...it comes out as gibberish

everyone's avatars were blanked as far as i can tell. i reset mine however several people have said that their avatars are not available

 

in addition id like to add several other problems incase a moderator is looking at this thread and has not seen my post on them elsewhere.

 

-the like button doesnt work ...it says 'limit reached' even though i havnt used it

-the profile feed button doesnt work. you type and press update and nothing happens

Thanks for all the feedback. We will continue to address bugs and refine the forum behavior over the coming weeks. Ideally, forum feedback should be sent directly to migration.support@fantasyflightgames.com.

Regardless, we greatly appreciate the time you've all taken to make us aware of your experiences, both positive and negative.

Only a small selection of Avatar images were uploaded (over 1,300 to be exact), and we will continue to add more after we address the more pressing issues at hand. We appreciate your patience and hope you can find an acceptable image in the meantime!

Best,

FFG Webmaster

PS – Also, let the Liking of posts commence.

Thank you FFG Webmaster! The Like button is fully functional now. I might just go around and like everybody's posts just because I can! Haha   In regards to your problem DevastazioneH88, it did the same thing with me with the profile avatars. They're blank at first, but if you keep trying to get them up, such as by closing and reopening the "Change my Avatar" box, the pictures should eventually appear.

> what is the point of a like button if there isn't a unlike or down vote or somthing? This "funcaiton" is compleatly usless. ...if enough people dislike it then the post gets hidden and people have to expand it if they wish to read... you kow.. like a REAL like system.

I never understood the principle of "like" buttons. But "unlike"? Clicking a small button to make others feel uneasy doesn't seem to be a good way to run any forum to me. After all there is a always a human behind an alt.

the point of a "down vote" is that if the community can self regulate. People do not need to get into arguments and yell at each other cause that have diffrent ways of lookign at things or perciv e unoffenive chatting as some kind of personal atatck or w/e witch happens all the time. All they need to do is click the down button and if enough get clicked the post is hidden and a user needs to click the expand button to CHOOSE to read it.

i've never understood the principle of them either...or any social thing on the internet....however i was particularly looking forward to being able to show my appreciation for when people post spoilers. good ideas and so on, hence me liking the idea

hey web guy... look at teh formatting of the threads. there is some kind of pixle shift caused by the avatars or somthing making the first bunch of lines indented. This only seams to happen when you have more than one pharagraph in a post... check richies post #2 on this thread to see what I mean. My OCD will nto stand for such messyness!

So if I'm not logged in I can see who posted last in a thread, but if I'm logged in I can't. :huh: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_huh.png]

I was wondering about that myself...
