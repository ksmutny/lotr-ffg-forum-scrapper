Hey guys,

For all of you still itching to own your own Khazad-Dum set, my sympathies go out to you.  For all of you who do now own it and have played it some, have you noticed some pretty brutal shadow strategies in this set?  I love it!  I pulled a Swordsman and was forced to take his attack undefended his shadow card was Dark and Dreadful which gave him a heafty +2 to his attack for a total of 7! My goodness, that was one really dead hero! The challenge is on in this set.
