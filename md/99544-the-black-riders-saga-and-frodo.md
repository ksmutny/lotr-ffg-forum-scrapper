I'm coming back to LoTR LCG after a few years out and decided to buy the Saga expansions rather than each AP.

 

One question I can't seem to find the answer about is that in the rules sheet for The Black Riders there is a decklist you can use if you want, which has Sam, Merry and Pippin as the heroes.  But in the rules it says you must use Frodo.  Is Frodo a fourth hero you must use in the saga adventures?

 

Thanks

Yes.  This is mentioned on page 2 of the Black Riders rulebook.

Should also mention he has a threat value of 0 and does not count against the limit of 3 heroes.  So you play with 4.

Thanks for the info.
