Okay I hope this hasn't been answered already,
I was just curious why you need 2 core sets to play a multi-player game?

There are enough heroes in the core set for 4 people why the need for a 2nd core set?

Thanks!!

you can play a 1-2 player game with 1 core set.

3-4 you need a core set because you only get 2 threat trackers (and enough tokens i would say) for 2 players

not just this, but  dekc building options are pretty limited with the cards in the core set for 3-4 players

it is of course completely possible, you just need to make a threat tracker

Plus you would probably run out of recorce tokens and sometimes damage tokens with 3-4 people.  I even get pretty close to running out once and a while with with one core set and i'm a solo player but thats only when I'm getting tons of recorces coming in….  Glaurung(another guy on these forums) uses dice to keep track of his recorces, damage and progress tokens.  He swiches the dice to the number that equels his recorces in the game.  I think thats nice because it keeps you from always moving pieces all over the place.  Instead you just use a dice to keep track of it.  But yeah you can play with just one core set with 1-2 players but you will need another core set when you get 3-4 people playing.  And If you have 3-4 people playing, you will only have enough cards to play with just the starter decks which are 30 cards each.  That is fine but those decks can only beat the first senario and once in a while the second senario in the core set.  A legal size/tournament deck requires 50 cards per player and those decks can beat senarios much better.  These can be built by combing multiple spheres into one deck.  If you want to play with 3-4 people and be able to make bigger decks that are more effective you will need to buy some expansions.  Right now there are 18 expansions to choose from and each come with a new senario and more player cards to build better decks.   Yikes! looks like I really dragged this on!  Sorry if I'm telling you too much or you already know all of this.

I've been playing 3-4 player games since the game debuted with naught but a single Core Set and it has never been a problem.

I just use dice for extra Threat Trackers and have run out of tokens at MOST just once or twice.

With *just* the core set, you'll be limited to the 30 card "starter decks", but it doesn't take long before you can start making full 50 card decks for all the players.
