I really like Elrohir.  Are we to assume Elladan is an an ally coming in the Redhorn Gate AP?  Is there any info on Elladan.

Elladan will be a hero in an upcoming AP.  He is Elrohir's brother; if one of them is a hero the other will be as well.

Thanks for the info Bohemond.  I was really hoping to get them out together in the next AP, I guess I'll have to be patient.

This is AMAZING! Me and my friend called this one though, but that makes it no less unstopably cool.

that makes sense, its just the 'while in play' part that points to maybe an ally, though i still think a hero is a better choice

unless ive missed some official word on this, and if so ignore me

I am totally speculating.  But making one an ally and the other a hero seems very wrong.  'While in play' means that you need to play both to get full value out of them, and if one of them falls in battle you could be serious trouble.

It may take some patience on our part to be able to use them, but I can't wait to field them both in a deck.

edit: edited to clarify my antecedent.

i see, im still going for the hero on both, it would make sense in every way, and they seem the two cards i am most exited about for this cycle so far!!

So now, the big question.

What sphere will Elladan be?

oooh good question, as it basically throws the whole usefullness of them into a pairing sphere deck, i.e. you have to always run the 2 spheres together to get the full effect of them both

 Maybe Elladan will be 10-2/1/2, while Elrohir is in play he gets +2 attack.

 And he could even be leadership too, we have seen back to back releases of the same sphere in the past. ( Boromir and Brand )

 

## 13 [Bohemond2 on February 20, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60726-new-article-is-up-the-new-hero-is/?do=findComment&comment=596661)

I think you may be right on about his stats (the power could let him ay to untap after an attack).  But such a hero would be a tactics hero, rather than leadership.

Keep in mind, Boromir and Faramir are brothers, yet only one is a hero. Sure, one was in the fellowship and the other not, but both played equally important roles, I think.

## 15 [Bohemond2 on February 20, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60726-new-article-is-up-the-new-hero-is/?do=findComment&comment=596687)

But these two brothers are narratively linked.  they do things together.  Foromir and Boromir run off in different directions

But remember, the two Tactics ones back to back were only after they had released a "full cycle" of one new hero for each sphere, so it was like they were starting the second cycle. In this case I don't think they'll do that as all spheres are even again so that would put Leadership up two.

My guess is Elladan will either be a Leadership ally in this same Adventure pack or he'll be the Hero in the next one but will be a different sphere.

It might not make the most "story sense" but this is just a game so it doesn't really have to. For example, look at how many people feel Glorfindel doesn't really fit Lore sphere or his given stats.

Or maybe he WILL be a Leadership Hero but then will be like four or more Adventure packs away.

Someone on BGG noticed the "Reponse" spelling error. Hope they fix that or we'll have to have this hero "Born Aloft."

We won´t have to wait long as it seems he is on the cover of the next AP.

 This is the first hero after Bilbo to have their threat value higher than just the sum of all the stat numbers...interesting.

not a big fan of these conditional heroes. Conditional cards by definition suck more than normal cards already. .btu here we have conditional heroes... we already have the Dwarf God for farking sake. All this card dose is assure that EVERYONE is running nearly the same bloody deck. As if you run Dwalfs you HAVE to run ironfoot and if you run this new guy you HAVE to run Elladan... well sure you do not have to but 99% of times it would be the right choice.

This cuts down deck building opportunities and creative play... I could let the Dwarf God pass as a one off.. but to have more and more of these conditional heroes is a bad bad bad move.

Huh, didn't notice that. On the other hand, with Elladan in play, Elrohir is the only hero other than Bifur to have a threat value lower than the sum of his or her stats. I think it's a great, thematic card design, and I'm interested to see how Elladan completes the partnership.

Also, that artwork is fantastic. Maybe the best on any hero card so far.

 Discussing this with a friend, it's likely because of the conditional +2. Without it, the threat is higher than the printed stats, with it, it's lower. Therefore it seems a split to acknowledge such (though Bilbo's still doesn't make sense to us).

Not particularly.

Keeping in mind that Faramir was a man and that the time that this was placed he was have been much younger than we see him in the movies, where he is still overshadowed by big brother Boromir. Elladan and Elrohir are Elves, they would not have aged significantly in the same period (not that they were depicted in the movies) and, as was already state, they were more bound together than Denethor's boys. In fact, there was probably justification for Faramir to not appear at all, or more of a "Bilbo" type card (support role)

As an aside, Faramir is hands down my favourite LOTR character and I want little more than a hero version of him- so much so I made one and posted it on the geek. That said, I think there is a lot more reason to have Faramir an ally with Boromir a hero than there is for one of Elrond's sons to be a hero and the other an ally (similarly, I would understand if they were both allies too...)

That seems to be the design philosophy in Elrohir's case, yeah. As for Bilbo, the extra three threat was the price of an unconditional extra card every round. I happen to think he's worth it, but many people are inclined to agree with your assessment.

Bilbo would be crazy OP in single player... We house rule him differently, his starting threat is 9 minus the number of players, seems to work well. Still has a place in 4 player games...

On a side note, Denethor is different since he has to exhaust for his ability to work. Given his "tanky" nature I think he is equally useful in larger games even though he may never use his ability.

As i sow already many times designers take many idea from previous Lotr card game from Decipher. For example Gimly boost attack from his damage is the same as in old decipher game. So those 2 twins brothers will help each other as in decipher game and they both should be a heroes.........

Actually is quite funny to see this kind of analogy from Decipher game to FFG game.

@ Glaurung:

I don't think you need the inspiration from Decipher's game (or Iron Crown Enterprises', for that matter) to give Elladan and Elrohir bonuses if they're in play together. It's probably the first idea that comes to mind when thinking about character cards for these two. Most of the time they are mentioned in the books, it's not as separate persons but as "the sons of Elrond". The new idea would have been to make one card for the both of them.

And as for Gimli: If I recall correctly, there are over a dozen versions of Gimli in the LotR-CCG, so it isn't surprising the FFG version matches one of them.

I had made up a "composite" card over on the geek, but it did kinda get shut down (understandably) because they weren't awesome enough...

I mean, how do you get both sons of Elrond into one card. The furthest I got was they had a built in Unexpected Courage, ranged and sentinel. Coming in at a hefty 14 initial threat (3-2-2-6)

Doesn't have the Silvan keyword.. witch i think many people are looking for in a "elf" deck.

Sure, for a proper elf deck with the given cards we have at this moment, you are probably right.

But, for pure theme, the Noldor (Elrohir, Glorfindel) and Silvan (Legolas) can unite!

Elrohir and Elladan are the sons of Elrond (so, the brothers of Arwen) - I think they appear with the Grey Company in Return of the King - they were generally found hanging around with the Northern Rangers.

I like the synergy- I'm assuming it'll be a later AP as hero, rather than an ally -  although I feel like some kind of anti-orc feature would have been better  - whilst Elrohir is in play, Elladan does not exhaust to attack Orcs. Whilst Elladan is in play, Elrohir does not exhaust to defend against Orcs.

In play also means, that if you play a multiplayer game, one of the other players could also have him in play and the effect would work.

Like the character!

 

 Unless i missed someone saying it-

 

 Im sure it was stated that characters may appear as both allies and heroes in different forms! It could be that the brother comes out as an ally now and then a hero in a further AP!
