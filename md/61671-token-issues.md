Anyone one else have problems with keeping track of your own tokens during 3 or 4 player games? This isn't much of an issue with damage or progress tokens but we always run out of Resource tokens when we just try to use one person's set in a 3+ player game.

I'm really anal about missing pieces or cards so when I play with a group I try to avoid using my own tokens. I have even thought about marking them but I hate writing on my stuff. It would be nice if FFG sold addition tokens then we could use just one players set of tokens.

I know I could buy another core set to get more but I don't want to drop another $30.

Buy yourself some glass stone tokens.. you can get them from any game store... all sorts of colours and shapes... The cool thing is that the tokens can be used in all your games, they are not cheap fraying cardboard, feel good and look great. plus they will not mix with other peoples sets.. You can normally buy a bag of 100 for like 3 or 4 bucks ...

You could also try using a dice to keep track of how many resource tokens or damage you have on a certain character. I run into the problem sometimes while running Leadership of using all the resource tokens up, and the dice have worked out really well. Cheap too, and they come in a variety of colors for resource, damage, or progress.

This is how I do it.. 2x12 sided die per card is awesome, and covers more tokens than you need.
