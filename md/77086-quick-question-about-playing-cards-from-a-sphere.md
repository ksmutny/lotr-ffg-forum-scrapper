Hello everyone! A quick question here: is it allowed to play/pay for a card with a sphere that doesn't match one of your heroes sphere icons? For example: can I play a Leadership card while I dont have any leadership hero, but using songs/other resource icon giving cards? Thanks all for your help :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Yes. That is the songs purpose, so that you can attach it to a hero and then that hero is able to pay for two colors. Â So, for example, if you put a Song of Travel on Legolas, he could now pay for the tactics sphere cards and spirit sphere cards.

Thanks for your answer! Reason I am asking, is that for some reason I always have thought you are only allowed to play cards from spheres corresponding to your heroes, and that the resource icon cards such as songs only could be used to give for example a leadership hero a spirit resource icon, while controllong a spirit hero. You would have 2 pools instead of 1 to pay from. But I seriously thought you could only play/pay cards from any of your heroes spheres, and no others, even with songs. Thanks again for the answer :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
