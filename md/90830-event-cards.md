When do you use these, in the planning phase do you buy them with resources and then save them in play till needed like allies as such.Or do you buy them when needed during play.ive been getting them in plan phase and then keeping them alongside heroes till I need them unless card is a immediate effect or something.

Any advice much appreciated.

They can be used/bought anytime there is a player window. Unless specified otherwise on the card. To get a clear overview of when there's player windows I think you can refers to the rule book or the FAQ. Or you can try this link here

You pay for them and play them only when you want to use them. You don't need to prepare them during planning phase.
