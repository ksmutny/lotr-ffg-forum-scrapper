That page is not accessible. Or is it just me?

website has been dead for a while.. with the "account suspended" page showing... while I hope not... it would not suprise me if the site never comes backonline. At least not in it previous state.

<shrug> Most LotR activity is here, and RingsDB is a superior deckbuilder. Looking up encounter cards on Hall of Beorn is a minor annoyance, but I won't miss cgdb for LotR.

It's actually a lot more active in other games like Game of Thrones. I just used it on Friday or so, so it hasn't been down that long.  As for ringsdb being superior, I see the value in it, but I already have so many decks saved to Cardgamedb that I've been resistant to the change.

It was up on Saturday too.  It was sporadic Sunday morning then crashed with "Account Suspended".  Not what I would call "a while", but to each their own.  It's been a pretty good resource for thrones and Arkham for me.

I would not be surprised if they are rebooting it to only build decks/squads for Star Wars games.
