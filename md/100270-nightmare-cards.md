Are the nightmare cards the same look, smell, material as the POD scenario's?  Or are they normal like the rest of the cards?

Thanks

They're not normal. I do not posses any non-nightmare pod to compare. But they definetely not like cards from cores and APs.

Yeah cause the POD cards are totally different.

You guys think they will make a nightmare scenario for every released pack? They are the so much fun

I sorta think they're a little different from other POD cards, a little nicer quality. They're still noticeably different than regular cards though. Always kinda sucks when you can look at the encounter deck and know the next card is going to be one of the nightmare inclusions, but I suppose you could solve that by dealing from the bottom of the deck or something. I second that they should make them for all the scenarios, they really do make you want to replay them! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

You can solve it by not looking at the encounter deck until you need to deal cards from it. Or just sleeve them all.

We have sleeved all our cards but with clear sleeves. We put them behind a screen and pull them absolutely blind to what might come (including the shadow cards)
