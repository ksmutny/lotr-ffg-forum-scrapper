Is there a way to buy this thing in Europe? If I'd buy it from FFG it is $55 for normal shipping and $71 for faster delivery...Â  Maybe some of you people in Europe find it in your local stores?

As long at it is a limited edition I don't think they never will be available outside FFG store.

Hmm... now I have to think if it really worth almost $200 :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

It's not, you will get all the new player cards in regular relases and the videogame will be f2p.

I believe you can order up to 3 copies in one order so if you have some friends who want it you can place one big order to split the shipping costs.

Yep, Group order is the way to go. I did order the collectors edition to the europe. And the posting was slow as snail and Also expensive. But I like the physical parts of that order, but if you only want to have the digital game it is much better to invest directly in the steam...

But the full bleed cards looks nice and the playmat is ok, even some people dislike the faded colours. For my eyes it looks as it should after going though adventures in Harsh weather ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]
