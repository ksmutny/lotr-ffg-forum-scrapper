Bifur's ability reads:

 

While you control at least 5 Dwarf characters, Bifur gains: "Response: After you play Bifur from your hand, draw 2 cards." 

 

If I have 4 dwarfs in play, and then play Bifur, does he count as the 5th dwarf for his own ability? Would I be able to draw 2 cards?

no. The 5 dwarfs need to be in play at the time of playing the card form your hand. By the time he hits the table to make the total 5, the response window has closed and has effect fizzled.

 

You need 5 on the table BEFORE you play him.

Because it's say "AFTER you play", it does. Gloin is the same, but for Dwalin, reducing is cost, it is obviously before.

Yes, true. If it is a response, so it is 'after' the action: then yes. You control in that moment 5 dwarfs and the response is triggered.

that is the most retarded ruling I have seen in a long time. No way am I playing that. Terrible work there from the main dudes. I simply can not believe it. It makes sense rule wise.. but it is just a terrible designed card.

1. Don't say things are retarded, it's not acceptable.

2. How is that one of the worst rulings you've ever seen? Just seems like more dwarven synergy to me.
