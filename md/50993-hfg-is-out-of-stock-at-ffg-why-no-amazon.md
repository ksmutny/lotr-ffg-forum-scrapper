Does this mean the first print run is sold out already? Some regions in the world are still waiting to receive their copies, arent they?

Does anybody know FFGs reprint policy concerning LCG adventure packs?

Another thing that puzzles me is neither amazon.com, amazon.co.uk, amazon.de nor amazon.fr is selling LotR Adventure packs (they are only offered by independent sellers via marketplace).

Is that a new policy of FFG? That makes hunting down adventure packs via ebay, local stores, fantasy online stores and amazon marketplace quite tedious (and you pay higher prices + shipping as well btw). Combined with the rather "sloppy" announcement policy this isnt the customer friendliest experience with FFG (??).

 FFG told me that the HfG is sold out, and a new print run will be made.

Amazon did sell the adventure pack, but they are out of stock so only marketplace vendors have any remaining.

ok, then I seem to have misjudged the whole issue bc of the situation in Germany, where amazon.de neither had HfG nor CatC in stock (only via marketplace) and dont even have listed the remaining 4 adventure packs in their catalogue. Thats odd bc they sell the core set (but I guess the German publisher is to blame and not FFG).
