Not going to happen.

Steward doesn't need an errata, you just don't play it! :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

Has FFS abandoned development of this game - it seems to have dropped it's other LOTR franchise titles...and development has slowed, I really hope they finish the LOTR saga title.

Good ol' FFG, debunking those game death rumors by not giving us a word on said game for over a month, not to mention shipping delays.

What other LOTR franchise titles have been dropped? And how do you now development for LOTR has slowed down? Are you testing the game so that you know?

And most importantly: who is FFS? :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

As long as they pay for the license and their games are selling, there's no real intelligent reason to shut down a line

Maybe the game just doesn't,t need anymore errata, which I'm fine with!

Do we know that's true though?  I agree the game appears to still be selling well, but I have also been very puzzled by some of Asmodee's decisions.

Unfortunately, no idea of this, sorry. And yeah, there are some Asmodee decisions that are curious, I agree

Love internerd facetiousness, but that aside - Middle Earth Quest - has been dropped by FFG (got it right that time teach), War of the Ring another.

I'm glad development is still ongoing although as an outsider it looks like it has slowed right down.

Asmodee = cancer.

This is the only FFG product line I pursue these days, mainly because I am a complete Tolkien fan-boy and the quality of this game in context of thematic strategy card gaming is second to none.

Should this be dropped I will be bidding farewell to the retiring kings of thematic hobby games.

Well I don't think Seastan has found any other broken combos lately, so what is there to errata?

The only new potentially busted thing I know of is that Vanish from Sight, Wandering Took, Song of Eärendil combo where you can reduce every other player's threat to 0 and then Loreagorn yourself back to starting threat.

You could already do that without the use of Vanish from Sight.  VfS actually adds to the complication of the scenario by requiring you to have 2 heroes and a threat of over 20.

I think Vanish from Sight adds a new level of craziness to it though since you can absorb any amount of threat from other players without getting eliminated at 50. Maybe not worth an errata, but definitely a new card they added in the last year that has some interesting implications.

I don't think we have to worry that they won't finish the Saga expansion, or the current cycle, but after that it will about time to launch Legend of the Five Rings.   The one good thing about that is that Legend of the Five Rings does not really compete on the same platform as Lord of the Rings.  It would be more likely the Star Wars LCG or Game of Thrones LCG since those are both competitive (vs.) games.  Still, LoTr has aged at this point, it has considerable content as it is, any fan getting into it now has plenty to collect.  Once they finish the cycle and the Saga expansion, if they wanted to end the game at that point, it would be still be considered a very successful game with a robust and long run.  

Of course it would be great to see more out of LoTr, but if this is the end, its already a great success, one FFG should be proud of.

Well said!

Kinda gotta disagree.  We finally have a deep rich card pool that supports multiple play styles.  IMO the game has only been this good for a couple of cycles.

I agree with Took. The game is just starting.

I really hope that the next cycle is on the way, but if thats not the case and they are willing to keep the license for a bit longer, I wouldnt mind if they decide to go to the deluxe expansion route CoC took before ending it completelly.

A problem I will live with.
