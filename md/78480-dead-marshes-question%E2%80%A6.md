If gollum had shuffled back to encounter deck and it is not in the staging area , what happens when trachery card revealed with escape test?

1. Does player have to do escape test and failed?

or

2. Can player ignore the escape test because gollum is not in the staging area?

You still have to take the escape test; if failed, follow the effects of the card text (e.g. raise your threat level)
