Here are some spoilers for the new nightmare packs and the deck boxes (all 4 are the same):

Spiders quest look ok for me. I really like to play it. Deck box also cool! NEEDED!

deck boxes are actually quite large and probably hold more than 200 cards each. Sadly they are all the same (tactics) so I think the next 3-4 game night kits will have the other spheres included. 

 

Have not yet played the quest. 5 armies with the timer mechanic should be interesting.

That's really lame for the boxes, they should have been the 4 different spheres... oh well, I feel like I haven't missed out on anything too amazing ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]
