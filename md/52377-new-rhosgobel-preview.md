sweet cards, infighting looks really useful

 Now every sphere but tactics has extra-draw cards.  Infighting also looks pretty cool.  I'm also interested to see how many Mirkwood Flock cards are in the encounter deck.

 I've never heard of a "mathom" in my life, but that card looks like it'll probably be a "3-of" in my Lore/Spirit support deck.

"Infighting" seems like another tool to deal with things like Hummerhorns and Nazgul.  I'm definately gonna use that.

Hehe, I had the same reaction but then I remembered what it was. The Hobbits had a place in the Shire that was called the Mathom House I think and it was like a museum where they put various items that were found or no longer wanted. I might be misremembering. Basically a big community public storage. So the mechanics of that card are fitting, with the card draw and not knowing what you'll end up with.

Need to get our hands on this next adventure pack, definitely has some goodies in it.

Yeah, can't wait for Imrahil, some new player cards and a scenario with a new twist!  Really enjoying how the storyline is playing out through the scenarios and the challenges with each one.  I hope they create campaign rules to tie playing them together in the story arc with game impacts.

Does anyone else find this funny? Of all the spheres you'd think tactics would get the most card draw, or even card search :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Oh gosh, if I actually click on the card and read the flavor text, "The Mathom-house it was called; for anything that Hobbits had no immediate use for, but were unwilling to throw away, they called a mathom.  Their dwellings were apt to become rather crowded with mathoms..." Sounds like your memory was right.

I understand why lore is the primary card draw sphere.  They focus on knowledge, and gaining more cards could be seen as "knowing more."  I do find it funny that for a sphere called Tactics, you really don't get many options.  They have some powerful cards, but they are a niche sphere more so than the other spheres.  I'd like to see the next few Adventure Packs add Tactics cards that can turn the sphere into a viable solo option.
