juicy news…mmmm well done those who predicted it…bit underwhelming dont you think? or maybe not? i cant make up my mind on this one…i was expecting something rather more exiting and fresh….especially as it means fielding (intake of breath) glorfindel if you want to get the most out of it…and not a new one at that…(or will we still get one?) still it quite obviously has its uses especially given that you can progress 2 per turn….not to be sniffed at… and the themes all correct so i cant complain…also it does start justifying glorfindels price tag.ill give this one a 7/10 on the mouth watering scale

## 2 [Glaurung on May 29, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65242-asfaloth/?do=findComment&comment=637418)

Wow!!! I love Asfaloth!!! Glorifindel get really nice ability to deal with any Location regarding active or not. Will be very useful in my Glor/Frodo/Bilbo deck.

## 3 [richsabre on May 29, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65242-asfaloth/?do=findComment&comment=637421)

you know as soon as i wrote that post i predicted you'd like it……lets see what the forum thinks…..

## 4 [Captain Poe on May 29, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65242-asfaloth/?do=findComment&comment=637423)

I really like this card. I think that as the game goes on, tailoring specific cards like this will do loads to help characters become more playable. I personally never bother using glorfindel, as he seems overpriced for what he does. I just don't think his special ability justified his 12 threat. You throw in a card like this though… and he becomes much more appealing for his high threat. Can't wait to see what else this set has.

## 5 [Bullroarer Took on May 29, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65242-asfaloth/?do=findComment&comment=637435)

 I guess we were making the Mount too complicated for our own good.  Nice card though.  Basically the same as the cost of Dunedain Quest, but doubly good for Glorfindel.

## 6 [Mattr0polis on May 29, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65242-asfaloth/?do=findComment&comment=637437)

Wow, I really like Asfaloth.

They spoke up Mounts to sound like they'd be something more, but I think just having them as normal attachments works fine. We don't really need new card types just yet.

But yeah, Asfaloth is very cool! Our group gets good usage out of Glorfindel already, as he can do so much as a character. He's expensive but with Unexpected Courage he's a great quester and fighter plus can heal when it's crucial. But still, Asfaloth does make him a lot better.

Also between Asfaloth, Ravenhill Scout and maybe even Short Cut, Lore decks can quest great and deal with location-heavy quests almost as easily as Spirit decks with Northern Trackers, etc. Very cool.

## 7 [lleimmoen on May 29, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65242-asfaloth/?do=findComment&comment=637449)

I think he is superb. There are so many locations with no more than 2 progress tokens and not many with more than 3, and it is not that hard to place one. I have always found the Riddermark's Finest  very useful for similar reasons; now Asfaloth is much more potent I feel.

Now I would not play Asfaloth without Glorfindel (as I have never played the Stone without Aragorn). I still think we are up for a new copy of Glorfindel, if he is Spirit, he is to say combining Lore and Spirit is a bad idea?

## 8 [richsabre on May 29, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65242-asfaloth/?do=findComment&comment=637460)

i would love a spirit glorfindel…really open up the options of my lore/spirit deck….also you could have a themed 'flight to the ford' deck with frodo, lore aragorn and glorfindel (which i guess you can already have….i still dislike glorfindel…though less so now)

## 9 [Mattr0polis on May 29, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65242-asfaloth/?do=findComment&comment=637461)

I really don't want to see a new version of Glorfindel, at least for a while. Let's get some more of the many characters that exist in Middle Earth that have zero cards first before we start doubling some up.

Plus we already just got a re-done hero this cycle in Aragorn. That would kind of suck if two of the new cycle's six heroes were re-do's.

## 10 [jjeagle on May 29, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65242-asfaloth/?do=findComment&comment=637464)

So what other named mounts can we look forward to? Off the top of my head there are:

Bill the Pony

Shadowfax

Snowmane (Theoden's horse)

Roheryn is Aragorn's horse that the Dunedain bring down from the north for him, but he also rides Hasufel which Eomer lends to him

That's all I can think of. There are probably more named horses that belong to minor Rohirrim.

FATTY LUMPKIN!

@matt -oh yes dont get me wrong …. ive always held the opinion that ffg have plenty on their hands with tolkiens creations with doubling up/creating their own…im not keen for him now….just at some point

## 12 [lleimmoen on May 29, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65242-asfaloth/?do=findComment&comment=637480)

Hasufel, Erod… not sure though.

 The Mount idea will probably be somewhat useful as time goes on but they really handicapped it right off the bat. I'm guessing there is going to be a new Glorinfindel hero coming down the pipeline at some point as well.

## 17 [Beano on May 29, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65242-asfaloth/?do=findComment&comment=637547)

Asfaloth == awesome. I'd spend time figuring out how to get Glorfindel in my decks, but if they follow the Aragorn/Sword that is now broken model we'll get a new better version anyway (crosses fingers).

## 18 [Budgernaut on May 30, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65242-asfaloth/?do=findComment&comment=637613)

 I like Asfaloth, but I don't understand why he's not an ally when Riddermark's finest is. He could have had the same ability and even done 2 progress tokens instead of 1 if Glorfindel was in play. Then you have the added bonus of sacrificing if necessary. I will admit that making him an attachment is more thematic, but I just find it odd that one of the legendary creatures of Middle Earth is just an attachment.

## 19 [Dam the Man on May 30, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65242-asfaloth/?do=findComment&comment=637647)

Heh, seems like someone ( cool.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/cool.gif] ) called Asfaloth as a Lore card in a recent threat. Tough though, I currently have Glorfindel in my Lore/Leadership, but was/am planning on replacing him with Loragorn. Now it seems one of them will not make it llorando.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/llorando.gif] . Well, unless I take out Beravor from Spirit/Lore and throw in Glorfindel there, that deck does have UC so could work…

## 20 [starhawk77 on May 30, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65242-asfaloth/?do=findComment&comment=637649)

I would like to run this in a game with Glorfindel, but play it on Arwen. You know, just to troll people like rich lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif]

The card itself is pretty good. Repeatable location removal is great (see: Northern Tracker), so I think it'll see plenty of play alongside Glorfindel. 

## 21 [guciomir on May 30, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65242-asfaloth/?do=findComment&comment=637682)

This is way better than Northern Tracker (assuming u have Glorfindel). You can easily get rid of a nasty location BEFORE quest resolution, so it gives you a lot of speed.

I wonder how new Glorfindel will look like.

Asfaloth can get rid of a newly encountered location. Tracker can't.

## 28 [muemakan on May 30, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65242-asfaloth/?do=findComment&comment=637731)

 Probably not, or only with some trait restrictions…….otherwise we would get 4 resources out of SoG.

## 29 [richsabre on May 30, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65242-asfaloth/?do=findComment&comment=637735)

That's what I've been wondering for a while, a card that readies attachement(s). I actually believe yes, we shall see get it sooner or later - perhpas an event type though.

On a similar note, how about a card that transfers an attachment to another legal target - would be most useful with the Steward sometimes, I think we shall see that as well.

## 31 [richsabre on May 30, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65242-asfaloth/?do=findComment&comment=637740)

yes like the dunedain attatchments 'spend 1 resource to move to another hero' ….that would be very useful

## 38 [Budgernaut on May 30, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65242-asfaloth/?do=findComment&comment=637954)

 I think it's not a creature because it's an attachment and not an ally, but I'm not sure. One that always bothered me was that The Eagles Are Coming is an Eagle card but Support of the Eagles is not. I assume that one was to prevent getting Support of the Eagles via The Eagles Are Coming, assuming that combination would be unbalanced.

## 39 [Hannibal_pjv on May 30, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65242-asfaloth/?do=findComment&comment=638010)

This allso allow cards that affect mounts! It is allso more vulnerable than ally because it is discarded together with the bearer.

Nice to see what effect other mounts have… I will predict that shadowfax reduce the treath… what else…

 

## 40 [muemakan on May 30, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65242-asfaloth/?do=findComment&comment=638028)

 Shadowfax

Cost: 0

Play on Gandalf to let him stay for another round.

## 41 [richsabre on May 30, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65242-asfaloth/?do=findComment&comment=638033)

sounds like a good card……

## 42 [Cunir on May 30, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65242-asfaloth/?do=findComment&comment=638053)

maybe it could reduce his cost from 5 to 2, or something like that (to make him "speed" into the game quicker)

i cant see how you could have a mount attached to an ally that only sticks around for one round though. its about time we had a proper gandalf hero

 It's a nice card effect, but very disappointing in terms of being a "new" type.

 

Mount is no different from any other attachment right now.

I like this a lot. I would word it differently to be something like, "Attach to Gandalf. At the end of the round, discard Shadowfax instead of Gandalf." Then Gandalf's text of, "At the end of the round, discard Gandalf" remains in effect for the following round. And you could potentially get all three Shadowfax cards on Gandalf in consecutive rounds, allowing him to stay for 4 rounds. And I don't think it's a game-breaker since part of what makes Gandalf so powerful is his enter-play ability. So it really does seem like a nice, balanced card.

## 48 [Mattr0polis on May 30, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65242-asfaloth/?do=findComment&comment=638093)

I kinda think that would be a bit broken since I can play Gandalf, then keep playing free Shadowfax and then Erebor Hammersmiths and Second Breakfasts to retrieve Shadowfaxs and get to keep a 4/4/4/4 Gandalf in play for quite a while, starting very early in the game, like turn 2. ^_^ [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_happy.png]

Fun idea though.

## 49 [Budgernaut on May 30, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65242-asfaloth/?do=findComment&comment=638107)

 Okay, I forgot about attachment retrieval. That is a very valid point.

This wouldn't make a lot of sense. Sure, it would handicap players by preventing them from using the attachments, but they would be of no use to enemies. They shouldn't even be made to work for them since they confer their abilities to heroes or certain characters, which enemies are neither/nor. I find the encounter cards that we have, or may get in the future, that discard attachments are a more appropiate way to deal with them.

As soon as I saw Asfaloth, I wondered about getting a card that readies attachments. However, owing to the potential for abuse with stuff like Steward, it has to be an event and not a permanent card, if it is ever made.

## 51 [lleimmoen on May 31, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65242-asfaloth/?do=findComment&comment=638519)

Yeah, that's what I had said earlier, event makes more sense. Maybe a secrecy event that readies any one card - cost 3, secrecy 2. Could have a use or two.

## 52 [DarthJalapeno on June 1, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65242-asfaloth/?do=findComment&comment=638847)

Does Asfaloth come with night-vision goggles or why are they releasing him with a pack that is all about moria??

## 53 [booored on June 1, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65242-asfaloth/?do=findComment&comment=638849)

people that try to follow "time lines" and other lore things go mad … this game is just "put cool LoTR theme stuff in the packs" each encounter quest is themed with in itself .. but there is no determinable pattern to the player cards apart form them being generally LoTR themed. Yes.. Horses inside Moria… pretty lame.. but no more than frodo leaving his hometown b4 the fellowship or some random group of adventures opening the door of moria before pipen.. or etc etc etc… there is NO lore in this game.. it is just a hodgepodge of cool stuff.. do not look for continuity or any kind of timeline.

## 54 [lleimmoen on June 1, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65242-asfaloth/?do=findComment&comment=638920)

Yes, there really is no thematic match between the scenario and the player cards inserted within the adventure pack. Well, there were few hints earlier, very few though. Mines are no place for a pony but likely for a huge steed?

## 55 [Glaurung on June 1, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65242-asfaloth/?do=findComment&comment=638922)

Yes Eagles flying in Moria halls and Horses running underground sounds a bit weird…… but game is game. For example in previous Lotr Tcg from Decipher all mounts have ability :Discard this card if fellowship go underground.

Anyway in my opinion Asfaloth  is too powerful!!! My Glorifindel/Frodo/Bilbo deck already can win any scenarios (not include Dol-Guldor) but with Asfaloth deck will be much more effective. Glorifindel is going to be stronger and i love it. When you have Glor with St. of Gondor, Asfaloth and U.C. he is quest/kill/location removal/heal machine.

## 56 [richsabre on June 1, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65242-asfaloth/?do=findComment&comment=638938)

it would (yes this is coming from me!) be very boring collecting packs if they had to stick to theme…..firstly you would know what was coming ….ie moria = more dwarves…..and yet more dwarves…now while ffg favour dwarves in the moria packs they still need to inject some variety as it would rather repetative and they soon run out of new fresh ideas

also, while im a believer that the game shouldnt break tolkien lore to the point of ridiculousness (ie releasing eru illuvatar or luthien- unless she was in a 1st age supplement etc) it would again be very hard and restricted to create theme correct packs everytime……alot of the fun i get out of this game is putting new and varied decks together and have a large collection of cards options

## 57 [lleimmoen on June 1, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65242-asfaloth/?do=findComment&comment=638940)

Yes, making game too logical is hard. And I am very glad we don't get just Dwarves in these packs. They have been given most attention by far but it's good other factions can keep expanding too.

## 58 [richsabre on June 1, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65242-asfaloth/?do=findComment&comment=638942)

i wonder how much attention they will get after this cycle (with the exception of the hobbit packs)….there is plenty more dwarf cards that could be made, i assume theyll keep trickling them in now and again…at least i hope they will

## 59 [booored on June 1, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65242-asfaloth/?do=findComment&comment=638972)

I'm sick of people who complain about horses in the dungeon. Any game, not just LOTR LCG.

Everyone knows that those are just games and most of this stuff is irrelevant (because games are for fun). You just play and don't analyze the world. But some people are very selective and they claim that: horse in the dungeon = bad game, no horse is the dungeon = good game.

There would be no fun, if for every rule there was a ton of exceptions. This axe gives +2 attack. But only 1 if you are a woman, or a hobbit. Woman hobbit can't wield it. Exception: if you are an orc woman, +2 bonus applies. Also woman blacksmith gets full bonus. If you are on horseback, there is 1/6 chance that Axe will give double damage. But only if the horse has been trained to have a rider. Otherwise, no bonus. Also, if the horse is trained, but you are charging during a rain or snow, make this bonus to just 1/12. If the average wind speed is above 70 km per hours (or miles if you prefer), than having such axe is a big risk and can result in some random damage if you don't wear greaves. Horse can't be brought to the dungeon. Exception: if horse has been trained whole life and it's size is ok (so the dungeon is very wide), horse can go. But you can't charge on its back if it is really dark. Unless the hall is very high and horse feels safe. Most importantly, whenever you enter a dungeon room, you need to check if horse will be able to rotate freely, it depends on the dungeon room of course. Oh , and no eagles in the dungeon. Dragons obviously CAN be in the dungeon, because we are all used to this and don't question it. But no eagles, period.

Yeah, I had some fun :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Yeah :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Anyway,  I think there is a pretty good chance that the hero will be new Glorfindel. Asfaloth card refers to him, the way Sword That Was Broken refers to Loragorn, A lot of people were predicting Tactic Glorfindel, but since Tactic has quite a lot of heroes now, Spirit Glorfindel is more likely. I wonder if he will be able to replace Eowyn due to his high willpower.

I hope  there is no new Glorifindel  in FOS. I also think better we get a new hero instead of new copy of current ones.

If it is him, his stats will be just the same, very likely. But the ability, I really have no idea… all in all, he could be a great boost to Spirit for his 3 attack…

Actually not so bad! Maybe it will work like puttin tokens on the Gandalf and when tokes are removed, remove Gandalf. So it would allow Gandalf to stay in play even longer! Maybe even too powerfull? Well, not actually because you get those when ypu play effect only once… I really like this idea!

Exactly. I have been trying to express this all along. Of course there are characters more important to the story, and the beauty of the story is that the most ordinary (even though that is very relative) characters can do great things. But as far as the most powerful characters go (at the end of Third Age Middle-earth) Glorfindel is surely among them. So please, do, impressive indeed, even if it has a cost.

## 69 [Serazu on November 29, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65242-asfaloth/?do=findComment&comment=1350941)

Necromancy, I know, I know - still, I do not think my question is that important to merit a new thread...

 

I'm thinking of trying to replace Glorfindel in my Outlands deck with Galadriel to see how it goes. My experience with Outlands decks is that card draw is THE KEY to winning, so I'll give the lady of Lorien a try. My vulnerability in early game survivability is mitigated by 3 Envoys of Pelargir plus 3 Westfold Horse-breeders, while Galadriel's 4 HP can normally absorb at least 1 undefended hit, while this deck's card draw is insane to get all required pieces asap and get the engine running: Beravor, Galadriel, 3 Hunters of Lamedon, 3 Daeron's Runes, 3 Deep Knowledge, not to mention 3 Gandalfs and 3 Sneak Attacks in desperate cases.

 

So my question is this: does a copy of Asfaloth attached to Galadriel merits a spot in that deck? Placing just 1 progress token in a location is slow and Asfaloth costs 2. Still, it's better than nothing and, with 3 Horse-breeders in the deck, chances are good that the mount will come into my hand, thinning my deck all the while. What do you guys think? Shall I include him? The other cards that fight with him for the 50th spot are: 1 Gleowine (perhaps a little redundant in my deck, since I already sport much draw), 1 Power of Orthanc (silver bullet in specific quests - a potential discard with Daeron's Runes in most cases), 1 Henamarth Riversong (strangely, not for his ability, but mainly for being a cheap chump blocker till the Outlands machine gets going), 1 Nenya (though Galadriel's ability is so much better and I have no means of standing heroes in my deck - I simply have no use of one) or 1 Will of the West (torn about this in a deck that needs to draw Outlands asap).

 

If we were back in the Mirkwood and Dwarrowdelf days, I wouldn't have asked you that question; Asfaloth would surely be in, since most locations had few quest points. This is no longer the case and Asfaloth without Glorfindel is too slow and expensive for what he does. He adds an element that my deck is lacking however.

 

Your suggestions?

Nenya adds the lore sphere to Galadriel. Furthermore it's nice to have a 4 WP backup, even if you don't plan to use it. Better than adding one progress token to a location anyway.

glorfindel is very quickly getting outpaced in recent times. for me there is no room for him in the current outlands deck and he hardly ever gets in my decks at all. the low threat isn't worth the loss of a some of the MASSIVE utility that other heroes bring, as well as the cards slots you need to waste to utilize him efficiently, like that attachment.

 

As for Asfaloth? Yeah, your right.. it is not really needed so to speak if you use him in the "old way". Back in the day it was as a way to remove locations completely from the staging area before you travel to them. Now with penalties for having progress tokens hanging about in the staging area and large quest count locations this method of clearing is no longer the best approach in many quests. Far better is to try and clear a traveled location every round. This keeps the staging area low and you find that it is a accumulative effect. This is why the Lorien Guide is making a comeback. Asfaloth can be used in this exact same manner. To add tokens to the traveled location regardless of if you quest successfully or not. The Guides and Asfaloth are among the only real options you have if you are under questing, as when that location is removed, you drop the entire staging area threat.

 

So like all things it really depends on the quest and more importantly on your deck. For me though I hardly ever run either of these cards.

## 73 [Glaurung on December 4, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65242-asfaloth/?do=findComment&comment=1355959)

I still think Asfaloth and Glor spirit still very powerful and playable hero. Thats combo is pretty fit any metagame in my opinion!

## 74 [booored on December 4, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65242-asfaloth/?do=findComment&comment=1356322)

Well yeah it has power, but your probably running that spirt attachment so he doesn't tap to quest and the horse,lets say 5 to 6 slots in your deck and no functional hero ability. There are just better options and combos now. He is strong but not stronger, and frankly I'm bored of him and hardly miss him.

## 75 [Glaurung on December 4, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65242-asfaloth/?do=findComment&comment=1356421)

badda boom tish! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

Seriously though, was on phone so didn't get time to do a proper reply but sGlorfindel requires so much support. It is a massive investment in your deck design to run him, usually a minimum of  3 deck slots (3x Light of Valinor) and often 5 (+2x Asfaloth) Then if your running that 5, you might be forcing a Lore leader and I have even seen people put in Master of the Forge to speed up the attachment fetches.

 

So on a bad build you might be looking at 9 deck slots just to field him, and his hero has no native ability. Just stats.

 

Now I am not saying he is a bad hero, he is very strong, but he heavily affects your deck build due to the amount of support he needs taking up your deck slots. I just feel that there are tons of better options now the pool has opened up a little.

## 78 [joezim007 on December 5, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65242-asfaloth/?do=findComment&comment=1357011)

All I care about is 3x Light of Valinor for Glorfindel most of the time. If I'm running Lore, I might throw some Asfaloth in there, but it really doesn't matter that much for the great majority of quests. You certainly don't need Master of the Forge.

 

Simply with Light of Valinor on Glorfindel, you have a 3 willpower and 3 attack hero that starts with only 5 threat. That's plenty for me.

## 79 [booored on December 5, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65242-asfaloth/?do=findComment&comment=1357098)

Like I said you're using 3 slots of your deck for LoV to gain that quest power as well as losing a hero ability as he has none and requiring LoV to be drawn. Those three slots can be put to much better use.

## 80 [joezim007 on December 5, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65242-asfaloth/?do=findComment&comment=1357177)

If a hero has two great stats, then I'm going to want to spend 3 slots to give that hero action advantage anyway. Super low threat and two powerful actions is as good as almost any hero ability.

## 81 [Serazu on December 5, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65242-asfaloth/?do=findComment&comment=1357485)

I think that we all agree however that Glorfindel, though immensely strong, is probably a worse fit than, say, Galadriel in an Outlands deck where the all-stars are not the heroes, but the allies anyway.

## 82 [leptokurt on December 5, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65242-asfaloth/?do=findComment&comment=1357879)

Galadriel and her mirror certainly help to organize your decks. There's truly no need for 3 copies of Asfaloth or LoV anymore.

## 83 [Serazu on December 6, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65242-asfaloth/?do=findComment&comment=1358346)

Would you include the Mirror or do you find it too risky? And, if you decided to use it anyway, how many copies would you run?

Eh, yes and no. Galadriel is a hero that helps with Turtling because she can't be aggressive in any phase of the game unless she has Nenya and she helps build you up with card draw while she also keeps your threat down, so that's very helpful for getting Outlands set up, but Outlands is very weak in the beginning, since Hirluin is 1/1/1, so they need a hero or two that can dish out some numbers early on while they build up. So they're both very useful during different stages of the game for different reasons.

This is correct, that's why I also included 3 Horse-breeders to accompany in beating the 3 Envoys I already sport in the deck. They buy precious time I need in order to get going.

I always have 2-3 copies of the mirror in my deck. I only use it when I am need of a certain card that I don't have in my hand. Ergo there is no risk at all.

It depends on what you're deck is designed for and what, if any your other hands are designed for. With solo for example those first few turns are critical and key cards need 3 to ensure early draw, preferably in opening hand. Though Gandalf and that fetch is a way around this problem.
