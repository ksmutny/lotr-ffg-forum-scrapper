Hey everyone,

Hope you guys have calmed down after Gen Con (or Gen Can't) and are as hyped as me for the new packs. In the meantime, my blog has been busy completing the Ringmaker cycle of scenario analyses for Normal mode. https://visionofthepalantir.com/ringmaker/ [https://visionofthepalantir.com/ringmaker/]

I will now move on with the regular progression scenarios of the Angmar Awakened cycle. These will be brought to you over the next months. I am excited about it, as they are really enjoyable. If you want to claim one of the scenarios to analyse yourself, let me know and I will get you hooked up.

I will also be bringing exclusive Vision of the Palantir swag to Con of the Rings for everyone who is a co-author or a Patreon supporter. If you cannot make it to the con, then I will ship it to you. I got the chance to make this for free, so my Patreon money won't be used for it yet. More info about this via this link:Â https://www.patreon.com/vision_of_the_palantir [https://www.patreon.com/vision_of_the_palantir]

Thank you for your ongoing support, I hope to bring the first of the Angmar Awakened scenarios shortly besides other articles on the new packs that are being put out!
