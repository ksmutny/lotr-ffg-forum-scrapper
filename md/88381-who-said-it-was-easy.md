Finally got my hands on the actual quest of Stewards Fear (having had used its player cards as proxies for a long time). And it seems quite difficult to me, sometimes a bit tedious, trying to find enough locations, and often very tricky.

 

I thought the consensus has been this is one of the easier quests, yet, some decks that have beat Battle of the Lake-Town have lost to this one repeatedly.

 

What is specific to this quest, and I applaud to the designers for it, is that it defies many of the usual strategies. The fact that enemies, often with deadly engagement effects, jump at you every corner makes many a plan go astray.

 

Also, unlike the majority of the newer quests, and this is indeed most extreme with Drúadan Forest, Steward's Fear seems to be perhaps more difficult solo.

I hear you lleimmoen. I have played this quest at least 20 times solo with a variety of decks and have never managed to beat it. Sometimes I've been really close and sometimes I haven't, but I've never beat it.

i have won this solo once with an outlands deck and perhaps 3-4 times with a secrecy deck. that is perhaps out of 10 attempts, so 5/10 win rate solo.

 

multiplayer i actually found harder. i think it does depend on which locations you get and when, and of course this quest has a high variability of difficulty due to the plot and villain cards, and if you get any clue cards which can make a big difference.

 

i would say out of the first 3 against the shadow quests i have played, this is probably the hardest, with forest 2nd then amon din

Yes, I think this one can be pretty tough.  Its always a long quest since it requires you to have 8 cleared active locations during 2 of the quest cards. (Clues can make this easier) But City street can stall you, and it seems that it takes me at least 10-14 turns every time I play this quest.  It can throw problems at rush decks, but more fighting type decks and many others without a fair amount of questing, cant make it through the long search through the city.  While all this is happening you will get a plot that will make it even worse!  The Villain in combat wise is nothing, but it can combo to a pretty bad result with the plot sometimes.  Its a pretty tough quest but I've beat it 4/6 times with Flight to the Ford deck. (never played it with something different.) I did try a 3 player game against it and we won but it wasn't easy and it wasn't hard.  You know, that in between.  The thing that made it hard was all the darn locations.  By drawing usually 4 cards per turn from the encounter deck, (due to surge) it got pretty hard

This is one of the harder quests. I never quite understood why people said it was easy.

Beated it today from my first attempt with a Spirit/Tactics deck. Was tough and a close call though.

Just for the record, we beat it in 2-player, first game, and so far have not played again. But that is the only ground I had when saying it was easier in coop. It probably isn't, it is just easier to pack a few different mechanics into two decks rather than one.

 

It is on average surely the longest quest. My experience it takes normally about 5 to 6 rounds to win a quest in 2-player, and probably a round or two more in solo; but this one, as said above, is almost always over 10 rounds (unless you get killed).

Playing solo I thinks it's the most difficult quest of this cycle. The few times I've played multiplayer I've cleared it without a ton of trouble, but by myself I feel I either get bogged down with locations, zealous traitor to wipe out all my allies (or most of them anyway) and the plot almost always seems to be the worst one possible for the deck I'm playing

Well, my deck is not so ally dependent and I actually craved for locations because they appeared so rare in my run. Got swarmed by enemies but cleared them out pretty easily. And then I got Local Trouble on Boromir. Almost made me lose, finished with 45 threat level after using 1 Galadrim's Greeting, 1 Gandalf threat reduction and 2 Elrond's Counsels.

I never say this is easy one......Is very tricky and interesting. Plot idea is amazing and we can use it for other quests as well. Why designers dont make some plot cards for other quests?

 

In solo this quest more challenge then in coop in my opinion. In coop i never lose in solo many many times.

Oh wow!  

 

Our experiences can be so different!

 

I don't think I have lost to this one at all.

right, i've never lost this one, either, and almost every play through has been a cake-walk. the plots never posed any significant danger and the villain was even more of a joke.

 

i don't play solo, so i can't speak it it's difficulty there, but multiplayer it's pretty straightforward.

With an outland deck is fairly easy except if you get Up in Flames which will crush you (i have only managed 1 victory against this plot with Outlands). I beat it with and elven deck recently and it was tricky and long.The worst villain you could get is the hand but like Khamul said it is nothing in combat. The plot cards are what make this quest so challenging. I think so far for solo is the biggest challenge in these cycle.
