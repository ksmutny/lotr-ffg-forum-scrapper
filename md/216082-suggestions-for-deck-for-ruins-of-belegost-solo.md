# [Suggestions for deck for Ruins of Belegost solo?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/216082-suggestions-for-deck-for-ruins-of-belegost-solo/)

So I picked up Ruins of Belegost and am considering attempting it before returning to my Fellowship campaign.

Any suggestions for building for this for a solo, one-handed deck?

I have all of the Shadowms of Mirkwood and Khazad-dum cycles, plus the Hobbit Saga boxes and Black Riders.

This one is tough. I've got a pretty good deck here with every card available and I've scooped on turn two twice.

With that card pool, a Dwarven swarm deck would be your best bet, I would think, though I haven't played Belegost yet. Here's an example: http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/401/quad-sphere-dwarf-swarm-cotr-deckbox-2.0 [http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/401/quad-sphere-dwarf-swarm-cotr-deckbox-2.0].

So you save your cancellation for that treachery. With that card pool, I'd say Dwarf swarm is definitely the most generically powerful option available by quite a way, even if it may not be the best geared towards the quest (and it might still fit the quest pretty well to be honest, with the exception of that one treachery).

If you're referring to Echoes in the Dark, that's not that bad for a dwarf swarm deck with Dain. Pack 3x Test of Will, and if you're still worried toss in Faramir and/or a copy or two of Untroubled by Darkness. Won't be a problem!

OK, I'll give a dwarf swarm a shot. Seems pretty thematic to have a party of dwarves headed into an old ruin looking for treasure.

Though if I wasn't as limited on expansions, what would you recommend (and what expansions to pick up to make it work)?

Some other options could be a Hobbit deck or Boromir-Loragorn-Glorfindel

Managed a win with the dwarf deck below, though admittedly had a great opening draw and it was my the skin of the dwarves' collective teeth. Erebor Battlemaster at the end made the final quest phase possible. Lots of damage was dealt; Oin, Fili, Kili, and Dwalin did not survive the quest, though the party discovered three ancient artifacts and escaped. It will take the dwarves quite some time to shake off the memories of the nameless horrors deep in those ruins.

When we beat this one 3-player we all brought along dwarf swarm decks. It was fun, thematic, and still very difficult!

Got my copy of belegost/prancing pony delivered the other day, so yesterday I tried taking on belegost for the first time, with a two-handed pair of noldor and dunedain (Cirdan, Arwen and Erestor, paired with Aragorn, Amarthiul and Halbarad). These decks have done well against other quests, but suffered five defeats in a row. One game I got to round 5, but the others were round 2 or 3 defeats.

This quest is pretty brutal. I'm probably going to build a deck specifically for it, rather than trying generalist decks like I usually do. I think the key issue was that I was light on healing.

Ironically after winning once with my deck above, I've yet to win again -- often getting crushed badly. My dwarf swarm list is very reliant on getting the dwarf generation engine up and running early to clear locations and get loot before the dragon comes out.

Yep, got my copy a few days ago (with Murder at Prancing Pony) and it very tough (pure solo0. When the dragon engages you after 3 turns, the trouble begins...

I'll probably go for a dwarves party (I've always loved the dwarves, usually keeping them for the Kazhad-Dum cycle in nightmare mode).

 

I think another option would be a deck that manipulates the encounter deck like crazy (Risk some Light, Out of the Wild and maybe, even, the Palentir).

I was thinking of trying an encounter deck manipulation approach as well - so far i've tried noldor, dunedain, and rohan against it, and its kicking my ass. My two-handed rohan/gandalf decks, that i previously used for my saga campaign, has done the best so far, but even then i've only made it to stage 3D.

My Gloin Solo deck does pretty well against Belegost. It uses some newer cards so it might not help the OP though.

Well, after 7 or 8 tries with the Gloin deck, no can do, I always get crushed; most of the time, Gloin is not ready in time for the Dragon, and on the last attempt, the Lurker got added in the staging area, creating chaos and killing a second hero...

I'll probably try a Gandalf deck, or make Elrond a super defender.

Have you tried the Voltron Boromir deck?

I will post a Gloin video to my channel this evening. I got up to 10 resources on Stalking the Ruins because I couldn't find a loot, it was quite funny. Gloin took the damage like a champ.

I probably got unlucky with my card draw, I was always missing Steward, Blood or the belt...

 

I'll try again for sure, probably tonight.

I'd say it's slower to start than the Boromir power deck, but it can become more powerful.  :o [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_ohmy.png]

I have a question about this quest. If we search up loot using the Discover effect, I thought we still had to guard it by revealing another card. Is that wrong?

Loot cards are not guarded, so you don,t have tor eveal one more card because of that. And the quest can throw a lot more cards at you anyways!  ^_^ [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_happy.png]

Wow I've been making it even harder than it already is.  But what if we resolve a "Discover", find a Loot and there is no active location?  Can we then just attach it?

You resolve Loot when you travel to a location, so you always attach your loot to the location that you travaled to that is now the active location.

 

If you draw a loot from the enconter deck, thatn you discard it and draw a new encounter card.

Had my first attempt with a self made Dain, Bombur, Oin deck. Lost on stage 2B from threat ... this is very difficult indeed. I had Nautrlg and two trolls engaged on the same turn at some point ...

Try with Gimli. Gimli + hability + weapons works very well here. I think it is not casual that he has the deluxe version hero card here.

I beat this quest with a Secrecy Deck with: Sam, Glorfindel (Spirit), and Pippin (Lore). With timely aid, elf-stones, lots of powerfull allies of all 4 spheres, and a lot of threat control to keep me all game under 20 threat avoiding the Dragon. After a few intents with some other powerful decks, this one was the only with I was successful.

I think that a deck that can beat Battle of Laketown with strategy should also work with this quest. Never taught of that!!  :blink: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_blink.png]

I'm talking of Belegost, not Battle of Lake town ! I don't think that this kind of deck would be too good for Battle of Lake town.

I had six more attempts, it was Dain, Oin, Ori

 

While twice I went to 3D I lost of threat cause of the treacjury that raises threat for characters ... I had more than 10 each time and while I was going easy, the treachury destroyed me. I should have the Test of Will in, after the second disaster I included it. In one of the two games I had run through my whole deck !!!

 

On the others I usually get through 1 stage but then lose or dump the game. 

 

I get a feeling that if I have Keys of Belegost when I win stage 1 it is easier, else it is nearly unbeatable. 

 

Like it very much anyway, very nice quest

Finally did it, it took 17 or 18 turns (lostt he count)  "Ever my heart rises" was very helpfull on that since nearly each turn I was reducing threat. From the moment I had Dain with Steward, Blodd of Numenor, Narvis Nelt and Burnng brand with a couple of UC it went easier. I had to make a long road since Map of Ered Luin was under stalking ruins, I did not know that and went to 3C and then I discovered that I could not go to 4 from it. Anyway, did a little trip in Belegost and fought the last battle attacking Naurlug with an attacking force of 41 !!! Good dwarves 

 

Very nice quest

Feels very thematic to run this quest with dwarves to me.  Thanks.

The idea behind this is to get Dain with Steward and Blood of Numenor as quickly as possible. Then with the Belt and Burning Brand would make this even better. The sooner the better.

If you can afford waiting on the first stage to get the Keys objective try it, it is much better than have to kill lurker on stage two, but I guess you already know that.

Erebor Record Keeper and UC can help defending with Dain and Ever my heart rises is a great attachment here since all locations are Underground. You can clear active locations with the event to make your life easier.

Keep test of Will for the treachury that raises threat for characters unless your need badly to use it for some other reason.

There is a good chance thar by turn 6-7 you might have run through your deck with a bit of luck

It is not a strong deck, I lost 8-9 games to build it as it is and win, but it is thematic and fun

I win approx. 50% of my games with an ent deck, heroes: Erestor, Arwen & Beregond. Basically it's a remake of Chis Jacksons White Tower Sentinel deck http://www.ringsdb.com/decklist/view/1141/deck-tech-white-tower-sentinel-1.0 [http://www.ringsdb.com/decklist/view/1141/deck-tech-white-tower-sentinel-1.0].

It's a great combination of heroes, but I replaced all allies with ents and three Warden of Healing.
