Ok guys what card would you really like to see that still isn't out there?

And what is your favorite lotr character?

 

A card that i want to see is an Uruk-Hai. They have always really fasinated me and I really want to be able to fight an Uruk-Hai.

And my favorite lotr character is Haldir (Elf from Lorien)

As for my favorite LotR character…. I dunno. I like Bilbo and Eowyn a lot.

I'd say Gwaihir as well…

Gotta be Tom Bombadil for me. I wouldnt have a clue where to start with his stats or special ability!! Gothmog may be an interesting enemy to overcome aswell.

Tom Bombadil would be cool yes.  Mabye he would be a 'ready all blank' ability or a healing type.  Prob he would be a questing/defending type or something.

If we ever see Tom, it'd have to be as an ally objective card in a particular scenario. I can't see including him in a deck and then taking him to, say, the streets of Gondor.  (yeah, I know we can take Balin to find his own tomb… still, let's keep Tom special!)

Hero: really want to see a Theodan character although since this cycle is Gondor focused it would seem paradoxical if he were to appear anytime soon. Would also like to see an ally of Gandalf the white which I assume will just be another Gandalf named card but with different art and maybe even more powerful stats. 

Enemy: Saruman definitely

I'd like to see an Eomer, and definitely a Theoden.  I also think that they should make another Eowyn, one that's actually able to do something other than questing.  And, of course, Faramir.  I'd also like to see a Sam when they get around to more hobbits.

Favorite Lord of the Rings character: Gandalf

Enemy that should be made: More Nazgul, maybe a Shelob.

I think theu should to make all 9 riders. Will be cool also to see Saruman and the blue mages.

Erkenbrand would be great (esp. since he disappeared/was merged with Eomer in PJ's films).

You mean make all Black Riders seprately? I wonder what they would name them? That would be pretty cool though.  Would you think that they should have all 9 riders in the same quest?

Yeah, I'm also pretty intrigued as to how they will handle the "nazgul issue". IMO, all of the other Tolkien games have handled it pretty well, like Lotr tcg, Meccg, gamesworkshop lotr, etc. However, I think we already got a glimpse of how they will do it with Dol Guldur, with the Nazgul of Dol Guldur. I think it's a pretty good way to make them, with "Nazgul + -epithet-" or maybe names that don't scream out "nazgul" but they make way more sense on a nazgul, something like "Black Captain" or "Wraith on wings" or "Black Rider". That would mean though, that the nazgul trait would have to have an implicit effect so that there cannot be more than 9 nazgul in play at the same time. I hope that they do that though, at least that is how I would do it. 

EDIT: scrap that last point, it will obviously depend on the scenario.

I'd love to see Sam.

Or just more Hobbits in general really, I'd love to be able to run a Hobbit secrecy deck one day.

I figure he has to be lock for a new hero when they get around to making Rohan cards again. (Same goes for Eomer and Theodred too, I suppose.)

Yes. Full hobbit deck could be fun! So Sam, Merry, Pippin and Frodo has to have cards. Some of them allready have incatnations, but ot all. Allso Fatty Bolger, Lobelia (ah that fine women :-), maybe some others too! We now have power Dwarf decks and reasonable good Rohan decks with questing power, and soon Gondor decks with good defence, so a hobbit secrecy would be fine!
