Just a couple of questions. 

 

I have seen a video that says if you don't commit any characters to a quest that your threat meter will rise by the amount of the treat in the staging area. I have not seen this anywhere in written rules. Is this true?

 

Also when a character is on a quest he exhausts but what if I had an event or action to ready that character after could be be used for a defender or attacker?

True. See rulebook page 14, step 3.

If less willpower than threat in staging area you get a threat increase:

Threat increase = (threat in staging) - (committed willpower)

Yes you could, for example with Unexpected Courage.
