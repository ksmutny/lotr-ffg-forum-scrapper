# [Rules Questions - A Question](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/71471-rules-questions-a-question/)

 Do questions get answered here by FFG, or are they mainly answered by other players?

Is there another method that's best for getting official answers and clarifications, or is this the best place?

 

Thanks!

FFG people don't answer questions on the forums or even post here (except perhaps very, very, very rarely). If you want an official word, click the Rules Questions link at the bottom of the page (it's there, just darkish grey on dark background).

Here it's just players running their mouths (and fingers), mostly getting things right though aplauso.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/aplauso.gif] .

its worth posting here anyways as its much quicker and if in the event of a discussion that comes to an undecided  conclusion, we tend to then contact ffg

the guys are great there, but they tend to take a while to get back to you (though once i had one answered instantly)
