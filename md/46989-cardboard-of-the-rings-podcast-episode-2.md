I'm not sure which users here are responsible for the podcast, but about halfway through they talk about having 2 Celebrian's Stones and 3 Favors on Eowyn. The Stones are unique so she can have a max willpower of 9.

Yeah, two stones, that is our bad! I can't believe we missed the unique symbol, but these things happen! Thanks for listening!

With regard to Banks of the Anduin:

 

If it is flipped as a Shadow Card, its text is inactive. Therefore, no matter if it was technically "In Play" or not, it would not go to the top of the encounter deck. That is my interpretation, but I think it's a pretty solid one.

 

Another great episode! Thanks again for taking the time to do this!

 When a card is used as a shadow card, you ignore everything except its shadow text. So it´s discarded.

One of the guys did admit that he might have been playing Banks of the Anduin wrong and they did have a good discussion on what actually constitutes as being in play.

It was an interesting 'cast. i jsut need to get off my hands and actually post my thoughts on the quick fire card discussion and also chuck my answer into the bag as well.
