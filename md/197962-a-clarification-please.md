Hi

 

I'm looking to jump in to this LCG (and at least 2 others) and as I am a collector as well as gamer I'm listing the sets before I start shelling out a lot of money

 

(Don't judge me I'm off work ill and am a little bored)

 

I'm a little confused as various expansions share the same name (Nightmare Decks and some of the cycle decks) and I was wondering if there were reprints that shared the name 

 

Thanks

The only name that is shared is the adventure pack with it's respective nightmare deck, but the nightmare decks should be clearly labeled as such.  No expansions or reprints have the same name and different content, the nightmare deck just adds content to it's existing adventure pack.

I'd ignore all Nightmare content until you feel comfortable with the regular game.

Nightmare decks are just cards that add-to and/or replace certain cards in encounter decks you already own.  They serve the function of making the game more difficult.  They add no player cards.  I'm also in the process of collecting all cards, but I won't worry about those for quite a while since many scenarios are plenty hard to me as is.

Hope you enjoy the game!

 

When you start to dig in you should swing back by and let us know how you're doing. The difficulty can be a little steep until you know what you're doing but it's a great game. And we're all happy to help.
