If I draw Stinker does Sméagol’s 2 willpower become removed from the quest’s resolution calculation? 
 

for example if I quest with Sméagol (2 willpower) and Thranduil (1 Willpower) and I draw Stinker is my total willpower still 3 or is it now 1 for the purposes of determining whether I quested successfully? 
 

Many thanks in advance for the answer.

Yes, removed. Smeagol is no longer in play, same as if a character had been destroyed.
