Hello,

After solo'ing Escape from Dol Guldur with 50 cards, core set only, progression, etcetera, I lost a zillion times and only legitimately won a few. However, I noticed I would have much better success if I had the three attachment cards, Steward of Gondor, Celebrian Stone, and Unexpected Courage in my starting hand. However, I realized that getting these three cards in my starting hand were as rare as pigs flying. Therefore, for whatever reason, I decided to make a ridiculous two minute clip of the many failed attempts trying to get these cards in my starting hand synced to the famous CanCan song. After a gazillion hours of editing...BEHOLD THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!!!

Most... impressive?

You've got good video editing skills, too.

+1 to the video (especially the sync between music and the counter)

But seriously: why don't you take those three cards into your hand and draw three random cards? :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

I think you were shortchanging yourself in prematurely quitting if you don't have Celebrian Stone, Unexpected Courage and Steward of Gondor in your opening hand.  Even if you have those three, you cannot play all of them in round one anyway.  With 2 spirit heroes and 1 leadership, you could only play UC, but not Celebrian Stone or SoG.  You'd have to wait for the 2nd round.  So, in effect, you'd just need UC in your opening hand and could hope to draw SoG or CS next round before quitting.

If Eleanor (or Eowyn) is the prisoner, you'd have to wait for 2nd round before even having enough spirit resource to play UC.
