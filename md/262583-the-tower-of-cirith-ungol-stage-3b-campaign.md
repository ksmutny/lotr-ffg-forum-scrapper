Amazing quest! Both thematic and tense!

 

Just a small issue arised when we played it:

 

By the time we proceeded on Stage 3B, which instructs us to attach some boon cards to Shagrat, Shagrat was already in the Victory Display...

 

I assume that nothing happens in that case, I would just like to share it, in case we did something wrong

It looks like you didn't do anything wrong (killed Shagrat in the round that he was added to the staging area while still on 2B?).

It means that you'll miss the Forced effect which lets you get your boons in the middle of the quest.  However, since you did defeat Shagrat, none of the boons are removed from the campaign pool.  So you can use them in a later quest.  That's how I interpreted it.

Yes, we killed him during a multi-kill combo round (Hama + Hour of Wrath +  Unseen Strike) which happened to be just after he entered the staging area!

 

We also assumed we dont use the items for this scenario, but they are not removed from the campaign pool either!

 

Thanks for answering!
