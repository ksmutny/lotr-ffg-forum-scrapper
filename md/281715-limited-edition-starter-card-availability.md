So in the articles describing the new set, it mentions that all the cards for the decks are pulled from existing product, the 2 new characters will be available in upcoming releases, but it does not mention if the 2 new quests are or will be available separately. Have they stated if these are/will be available separately. 

I  am not really interested in the bling, and I have no interest in how they did the digital version, I just want the card game content. I am hoping I can get it.

They have not stated if they will be available separately; at the current time they are not.

Luke Walasczek said in an interview with   Roll for Crit that they’re exclusive. I don’t know if that’s permanent.

I still believe, even though the developers have given no hint that it's true, that the Starter will be released on its own at some future point instead of just in a one-time Collectors bundle.  It seems like a terrific waste to develop the product and then not use it outside a one-time event.

Let's hope they do release it later!

And here's hoping it's released with the original layouts. 

 

I really hate the new card layout, and hope that it's confined to the collectors edition. A) gives some exclusivity to those who went for the collectors edition and B) let's those of us who have it have them in the real layouts.
