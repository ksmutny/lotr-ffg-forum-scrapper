Just posted my playthrough report of The Ring Goes South. I have to say, I really enjoyed playing these decks, it was a nice change of pace from the five previous hobbit-decks. Find out how the alternate Fellowship did below:

Thank you very much, I'm glad you're enjoying it so far. Here is the next part of my narrative Saga campaign, in which the Fellowship have set out from Rivendell led by Glorfindel and Aragorn. Hope you like it!
