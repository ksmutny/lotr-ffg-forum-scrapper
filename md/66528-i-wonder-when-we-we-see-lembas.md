 And for Dwarves some Cram ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

 

Any guesses? would it be an attachment that unexhausts then is discarded?

 Lembas, elven rope & cloaks… With the elves we've been getting lately I have a hunch we might see them in the next cycle.

im guessing it will be an attatchment or event that when you play it heals hit points from a hero or character…..this is actually pretty boring as many things do this so id hope for something more imaginitive so hears a fun one:

Lembas

attatchment

cost 3

attatched character gains: at the resource stage heal 1 point of damage from attacthed character, every turn that the charater has no damage to heal, it gains +1 willpower until the end of the turn

cram would perhaps be a less effective version of this and not as sustaining, so perhaps limited to 2-3 turns of use
