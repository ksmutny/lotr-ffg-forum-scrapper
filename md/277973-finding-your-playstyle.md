Friends of friends become Captain of the west because the ringsDB card data base for the last saga expansion seem to have been alter after one or two weeks. Of course some decks have been posted before that. You have have friends of friends but the data base only know you have card15oflastsaga card. Since they change card 15 from friends to friends to captain of the west your decklist does not reflect what you put inside on the first place. If you edit your deck this will normally not happen again.

That was the only relevant thing I can tell about your article though ^^.
