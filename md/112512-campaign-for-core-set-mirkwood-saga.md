Hey guys,

I'm new to this forum and this is my first post.

I just played "Black Riders" Expansion and was thrilled by the campaign concept, so i decided to make my own campaign mode for the Core Set and the Mirkwood Saga to combine each adventure.

The biggest challenge was to find a way to reward the player after each adventure so they can heal their heroes or lower their threat count. But anyway here are the rules I thought of:

> Setup:
> 
> Each player choses 1-3 heroes and has to stick with them for the whole campaign.
> 
> The campaign card is placed to the side of the Quest Cards and will be resolved parallel to the Quest Card.
> 
> End of game:
> 
> - do NOT reset threat count
> 
> - All the damage that is assigned to a hero it will stay there.
> 
> - If an hero is in the Discard Pile at the end of the game can't be used anymore unless they are revived.
> 
> - All other cards will be put back into your deck (except Unique Characters).
> 
> After the Adventure is finished the XP are calculated :
> 
> XP = ( Difficulty Level * (15/X )) + Victory points
> 
> X = Number of Players
> 
> Victory/Defeat
> 
> - If the players win the game they earn the full 100% of the XP.
> 
> - If they lose the players lower their threat by 5 points, but only earn only 50% of the XP.
> 
> Heal/Revive Heros
> 
> The players can revive the heroes that are placed in the Discard Pile at the end of the adventure. To do that the players have to pay double the Threat Cost of that Hero.
> 
> To heal heros the player has to pay 1 XP per damage.
> 
> Unique Characters:
> 
> Players can keep Unique Characters and use them in the next adventure. The costs to do so is 3 times the costs of that character.
> 
> Threat Count
> 
> The players can lower their threat count for 1 XP per threat point.
> 
> Buy new cards
> 
> The players can expand their card pool by buying more cards. The costs are:
> 
> - Heros: 2 times their Threat Cost
> 
> - other Cards: Cost + 2
> 
> The rest of the rules stays the same.

I know the calculation of the XP is not ideal but I can't think of a better alternative. I'll appreciate new ideas.

I hope that I soon have the time to translate the Cards (Campaign, Boon, Burden, Allys…) and upload them here.

Nice idea....

 

One minor repair: On the setup, after the "X-1 copies of Forest Spider" you should mention "(to a minimum of 1)" because if not, then in a single player you don't add any forest spider.

 

 

What is this XP?

Thanks, I will change that :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

XP = Experience Points, Points you gain for completing an adventure and you can use to heal heros...

Sorry I totally forgot to Mention that you do NOT reset your threat count After each adventure. I'll edit the First post.

Very cool!  By the way, if I were going to do Mirkwood in a Campaign mode, I'd do this order cause it makes a bit more sense:

 

#1 Passage Through Mirkwood

#2 The Hunt for Gollum

#3- Encounter at the Carrock

#4- Journey to Rhosgobel

#5- Journey Down the Anduin

#6- Escape from Dol Guldur

#7- The Hills of Emyn Muil

#8- The Dead Marshes

#9- Return to Mirkwood

 

Geographically speaking, I think that one makes a lot of sense.

That is not complete correct. One forest spider came from the quest. So the idea behind that "X-1 copies" was, that there is a spider for every player. I playtested the campaign in German and the "x-1" was one of my feedback points. It was before "x copies". So, if you play with 4 players you need 5 forest spiders (one from the quest and four from the campaign). And there are only 4 copies in the deck. And the solo player had 2 spiders in the beginning - that is very hard.
