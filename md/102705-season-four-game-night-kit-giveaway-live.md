Great contest!

For me it's Stewards Fear. A great idea with enemies lurking in underground locations but a few

Things bugged me:

A) you can win the scenario without any clues

Would be better if you needed to find clues to catch the traitor

B) the final enemy is too easy. While it makes sense somewhat as he is not the ultimate big baddie it would be nice to have it more challenging

I'm most looking forward to Assault on Osgiliath for a Nightmare overhaul. I thought the whole "fighting for control of the city" mechanic was cool, but there were also a lot of ways to win in 2-3 rounds and it just felt like the encounter deck never stood a chance for once. I think with a few changes though it could be one of the more difficult and fun quests out there.

The Lonely Mountain. Too easy to finish it if you don't go for the treasures, and the treasures aren't really that valuable for The Battle of Five Armies. Had they been key for the success of Five Armies there would have been motivation to press your luck in Lonely.

In 3-4 players is it not so easy. In fact, half of game you end the game with almost all osgiliath locations in our control. So game is long and not so easy.

I'll say the long dark.

 

It should have been titled the short dark. Maybe because I only played it solo, but the lost mechanic never fired hard on me and I blew through that quest. I love the idea of getting 'lost', but it missed the mark a bit.

Yes you right. I love lost idea but is never work in solo or 2 players. Long Dark is work only 2 players up. But now with a new cards is waling in the park. So Nmode should make it awesome.

Also Ambush idea from Return to Rivendell. Also cool mechanic but never work….very easy quest. Nmode should change it!

All second cycle will be amazing…..Balrog…? I love shadow and flame but to boring now……….Nmode for Balrog also should be awesome!

I suppose so, but look at how they fixed Escape from Dol Guldur with a Nightmare Pack. Escape was nearly impossible for a solo deck to consistently win at, but pretty doable for 3-4 players. Maybe they can do the opposite for Assault, and make it difficult for 1-2 players without making it impossible for 3-4.

I look forward to the Khazad Dum expansion. This is easily one of my favorite parts of the LOTR series. I think thematically the expansion is wonderful but I look forward to even nastier shadow cards and in specific to into the pit, having cards "put out" the torch, I hate the wandering eyes attachment but love the theme it adds of sneaking around the mines and being caught by goblins etc. I expect more of this mechanic being added in the nightmare editions.

Thanks for making this contest Mitch!

Watcher in the deep because I thought it was cool, but would like to see what they are going to add to make it more interesting!
