I just played through this quest, and when I came to 2B I wasn't sure when I could actually move on to 3A. The description on 2B is: "If there are no Troll enemies left in play, or if there are no cards left in the encounter deck, advance to the next stage."

 

What confused me was that I defeated the trolls before being able to discard all encounter cards. Was I able to move on to 3A after that last troll was defeated, or do I still have to discard all encounter cards? The 1 progress on the card is what confuses me because you must complete all progress on the quest before moving on (as well as finishing off any other objectives). But instead of putting progress on the quest card, you have to discard the equal amount of encounter cards. 

 

So, in short... If you defeat the Trolls first, can you move on to 3A of the quest, ignoring that 1 progress on 2B?

 

Hope this makes sense to all of you, I don't know what to make of it.

this is the text

"If there are no Troll enemies left in play, or if there are no cards left in the encounter deck, advance to the next stage."

 

so the two parts can be split into

 

If there are no Troll enemies left in play

 

or

 

if there are no cards left in the encounter deck

 

so if either of those parts of met, then the final part happens....

 

advance to the next stage.

 

so taking it the 'or' there literally, then as soon as the trolls leave play, you advance

Yup.  Either survive til the sun comes up (no cards left in the encounter deck), or defeat the trolls before that happens (no trolls in play).  Don't have to do both!

How do you defeat all the trolls cuz the one says "trolls engaged with a player cannot take damage" do you really have to use quick strike, yew bow, dunhere ect?  Or am I missing something?

Thanks for the answer, that cleared things up! No need to do more work than needed, I'll drink to that!

But what about that one progress then? How do you get that? Or do you just ignore it and win when one of the other conditions are meat?

Okay. Funny they didn't made it into a zero. The 1 is just plain confusing I think ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] Thanks for clearing that out

Think that if it was a 0, you could interpret it by the rules as if you advance to the next stage immediately. Seing as the quest text only sets up additional ways of advancing the quest but doesn´t remove the already existing one.

Might seem like a small detail but it does remove that level of worded uncertainty.

I can sort of see that but they did it in the very first quest in the core set "Passage through Mirkwood" stage 3B the "don't leave the path" one. It have 0 progress in requirement and some printed win conditions. And I haven't heard anyone interpret that one into completed the moment it's revealed.

it is a strange one, as it differs completely from say conflict at the carrock where there is 1 progress needed, but you actually do need to place it to win....i still think its a mistake ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

Don´t leave the path: "The Players must find and defeat Ungoliant's Spawn to win this game."

This card clearly states that you cannot win unless you do a specific task (killing Ungoliant´s Spawn).

 

In We Must Away Ere Break of Day the conditions on the quest card circumvents, but is not worded in a way as to demand those conditions in itself, the pre-existing win condition.

The difference is subtle but it´s there.

I´m not saying they couldn´t have done it differently and I´ll admit the outlay of the quest had me pause, with raised eye brows, for a moment in confusion as well.

Still too complicated. 0 progress needed should result in clearing that stage IF nothing else is stated. 1 and more progress needed should result in clearing the stage when the required progress is acquired AND eventually extra conditions are meat. The whole thing that makes it complicated is that you can't make any progress. I think I'll play it like when the trolls are dead I'll play one last round and make progress. That seems the right thing to do. Don't know how I would do about it if the encounter deck runs out first. Maybe I should just just correct the 1 progress needed to a 0.

That's the only frustrating I find with this game. There's too much depending on the exact phrasing of words. It should just be plain and easy to understand. Not require you to really think about how everything should be read every time you play a quest. I haven't played one single game yet where I was 100% sure if I interpreted all the cards right. And that's just it. INTERPRETED. It shouldn't be a possibility to interpret the cards. A should just mean A all the time. Not "possibly" meaning A but a slight risk it might be B or even C depending on circumstances. So, done rampeling for now :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] other than that it is a great game :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] even made a friend through it so no chance I'll ever quit...eh...against that is :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

So... I had the same issue here.  But in a totally different way.

 

Just played this quest about 48 hours ago with a friend of mine.  When we got to 2B, we read the card and didn't realize that it said 'or' and read it as 'and'... So, we went through the encounter deck three times and the trolls bashed us into piles of goo finally...

 

And then we read the card and various words that cannot be repeated here were uttered...

This discussion has gone on longer than I thought it would!  I see it as simply being "card text trumps everything."  Therefore if a quest card says you win, you win regardless of the state of everything else in the game.

 

In the scenario "Into the Pit," card 2B says: "If there are no enemies in play, immediately advance to the next stage of the scenario. (Players can also advance by placing 11 progress tokens on Goblin Patrol.)"  

 

The card itself says you need 11 progress tokens to advance.  The parenthetical they put in there is a nice clarification, but from a rules standpoint it's not necessary.  Just pointing out that there is precedent for advancing past a quest card without placing the full number of specified tokens on it.

Hehe, okay I'll give in ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] I think I'm the one being stubborn and keeping this thread going on, so I'll just accept it. Good point GrandSpleen. And thanks for the patiense (patience? pasience? you know what I mean) and clearing it up.
