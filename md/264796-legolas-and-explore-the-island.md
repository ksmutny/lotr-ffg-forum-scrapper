I'm revisiting The Fate of Numenor (Grey Havens quest 2, this time in nightmare mode). "Explore the Island" 1.b states "Progress cannot be placed on Explore the Island except by quest effects". Can the effect on core Legolas (or Blade of Gondolin) still add post-combat progress to an active location? The original target is the quest, but the Active location would normally act as the buffer. (It's kind of the immune location question in reverse).

Yes, you can add progress on the active location, but not on the quest card

I'm happy with that answer! Thanks!
