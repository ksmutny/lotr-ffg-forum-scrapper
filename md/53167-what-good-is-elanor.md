Eleanor 7 1 1 2 3
[Hero]
Gondor. Noble.
Response: Exhaust Eleanor to cancel the the "when revealed" effects of a treachery card just revealed by the encounter deck. Then, discard that card, and replace it with the next card from the encounter deck.

 

While playing again, I noticed that Eleanor would allow me to cancel a treachery card, and then put another encounter deck in the staging deck.  I soon realized that this power was very useless since the next card is usually equally nasty (in my case another treachery card).  I would think her power to be useful would allow you to cancel a card without picking up another card.  Can someone explain how her ability is useful.

Journey to Rhosgobel. She's a must have.

There have definitely been times when a treachery card was revealed for me that would have killed a hero or two. Something like that is the perfect time to cancel the effects. Your heroes won't die which could change the game. Sure you get a new card that might be nasty, but it's likely to be something different that you might be better prepared to deal with.

I wouldn't consider it one of the best hero effects since it is fairly situational, but it can be a lifesaver on occasion. You're essentially trading a potentially devastating effect for hopefully something else that you can deal with at the moment. Maybe there are no enemies in the staging area and you get a treachery, cancel it and the next card could be an enemy that you are ready to deal with versus the treachery that could really mess with you.

There was a time when I shared this sentiment. There are points to make:

In Rhosgobel, Eleanor is probably the best as she gets to cancel a treachery and increase a chance to reveal Athelas at the same time.

It really depends on the quest. In those that are mild on treachery, Eleanor is not great. There are quests though where a treachery can be utterly devastating and Eleanor is the only way to save the day (if one cannot play A Test of Will at the moment). Of course, it is situational. However, her ability works well with her nice defensive value - being Gondorian also helps. One needs to build a deck around a bit but that can be done and applies to many heroes. You can then find out that you will use Eleanor in most of the rounds.

And she is cheap!

And she is hot!!!

The real issue with Elanor is that you need to save her for the quest phase. You could never possibly quest with Elanor... She does almost no damage and while she has respectable armour she doesnt have the hit points to use as a reliable defender, basically if she doesnt cancel a treachery effect she would likely remained untapped this turn.  Not to mention that if you are playing mono spirit, blockers are almost useless since at this stage you dont have anyone that could ever deal with an enemy, you would need to rely on the ranged characters of other players to eliminate an engaged enemy. Compare this to Beravor who, if you save for combat and her services arent required, you can just tap her for cards at the end of the turn- she is never wasted. Thats my problem with Elanor

Think of it this way though- if you had Elanor in a game you could potentially NOT run all of the cancel when revealed effects since you would just be able to nuke it with Elanor. I know at this stage the card pool isnt big enough to say, "well you can put better stuff in there now since you just freed up 3/6 card slots but its a thought.

Is anyone else building a rounded deck and playing a random adventure? Or do you tailor make your decks for the adventure? There seems to be a lot of "that's a complete waste of time except in this quest" cards at the moment...

I really want to do all the Mirkwood scenarios with one deck... (sorry for OT)

And I cannot wait to hear your experiences with Rhosgobel. I had to tinker a bit with my deck to get a chance at completing that quest (baring the inconceivable luck of drawing multible Athelas cards early in the quest). Good luck though.

I generally take the same view, build a all-round deck, but I will vary what heroes I bring, if only after having played the quest.

I started out thinking exactly like you do here friend. "What good is she if you simple get another bad card instead of the one you draw?"

But I soon changed my mind.

You see that point here is that different BAD Encounter Cards hit your Heroes differently depending on circumstances. Therefore, two Encounter cards that look equally bad "on paper" will have hugely different effects in any given game situation:

Example:

"The Necromancer's Reach" was one of the worst cards ever in the core set if you ask me... it killed more than one Hero and Ally. But only if you have a lot of Exhausted Characters... sometimes you don't. And sometimes you can take it. Some times you'd much rather take a "Treacherous Fog" sometimes you don't... depending on how high Threat Levels you have and Howmany locations you have in Staging.

See? Your assumption that any given Treachery effect is just as bad as anyone else for a given situation in the game is simply NOT TRUE.

I use Eleanor A LOT! I love her and wouldn't trade her for anything. I also use her as a "Blocker" if I didn't already Exhaust her during Questing to use her Ability.

 I replaced Eowyn with Eleanor.  The last two quests have been less about Questing than situation management and Eleanor is way better at that.  

 

I put 2x Dunadain Warnings on her and an Unexpected Courage so she could interfere with Treachery cards and defend each round.

 I find her really useful. The ability to cancel a treachery card is HUGE! Yeah, you'll still have to play another card, but odds are against it being as detrimental as the one you cancelled. 

Yes there are some quests she's better for than others and you won't use her ability every round, but I almost always miss her when she isn't being used.

I don't think it is all that hard. The biggest key is being able to heal at the right time. Most of the enemies, save for the baddies from the very first quest(Chieftain, Spawn) are very easy. Questing isn't all that difficult. The problem is that the deck has a bunch of cards which deal damage when revealed, the new treacheries and the old standbys like Dol Guldur Orcs and The Necromancer's Reach. But if you can heal as you go along, it's ok. Then, you have to manage Wilyador because the encounter makes it hard to heal him. I find that the key is to be ready and make your move, at the right time. It is sort of like The Carrock, when you are ready, you take on the trolls. Here, when you are ready, you heal Wilyador to the necessary level, which may vary, then quest and flip the final card for the victory.

just another question regarding her ability  : 

after a 'when revealed' effect of a treachery card is canceled, the treachery card is discarded and replaced by the next card from encounter deck. As the term 'replaced' is used it seems not to be revealed, hence according FAQ 1.1 the 'when revealed' effect of the replacing card would not trigger.

Up to now I play differently, and trigger the 'when revealed' effect of the replacing card in case of, but re-reading the description of Eleanor's effect I may play to difficult.

Does replace mean the complete card draw is replaced, i.e. the next card comes with resolving the 'when revealed' effect ?  Or the 'when revealed' effect is passed and the new card comes to the staging area without resolving that ?

Excellent observation. I would also like to know the answer of this now.

 You're still having to reveal the new card though, right?

Cards can get brought out through all sorts of means, but a "When Revealed" affect always occurs when that card is flipped over, for whatever reason.

 

At least, that's my take.

## 22 [Samuraibel on September 18, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53167-what-good-is-elanor/?do=findComment&comment=529693)

Was also my first thought, but the FAQ definitly refers to a form of the word 'reveal' for the game effect that causes the card to enter play to trigger the 'when revealed' effect of the card --> see below. I am not an English native speaker, but 'replace' and 'reveal' sounds for me not equivalent - but I may be wrong..

 

------------------------------------

Excerpt from FAQ 1.1

(1.22) "When Revealed" Effects
A card is only considered to be revealed if the card or game effect causing the card to enter play specifically uses a form of the word "reveal".
Example: If the players use the Stage 3b "Don't Leave the Path!" (CORE 121) quest card effect to search for a Forest Spider and put it into play, the "When Revealed" effect on the Forest Spider will not trigger, since the effect on "Don't Leave the Path!" does not spcifically use a form of the word "reveal".

 Samuraibel's interpretation is correct as the game stands now.  Hopefully the next FAQ will clear up some of these more persistent issues.  And no, "reveal" and "replace" are not synonyms.

Seriously? I cannot believe that it has come to this. Obviously, if you replace a revealed card, the card that replace it is only revealed.

Now, when the next FAQ shoots me down, I owe you an apology, but until then, this interpretation is inconceivable!

## 25 [Bohemond2 on September 19, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53167-what-good-is-elanor/?do=findComment&comment=530050)

I would also agree that if you reveal a card, and then replace the revealed card, that the new card is also revealed.  The situation with Elanor is in no way analogous to the forest spider example. Hopefully, the next Faq will clarify this.

## 26 [Titan on September 19, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53167-what-good-is-elanor/?do=findComment&comment=530078)

Although this interpretation would make her ability actually useful. But I agree that the second card should still be considered as "revealed", which makes her ability still suck. Worst hero in the game so far.

## 27 [HilariousPete on September 19, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53167-what-good-is-elanor/?do=findComment&comment=530092)

I agree with Radiskull - the FAQ rule 1.22 is pretty strict. Only when a form of "reveal" is used, a card is revealed. And just replacing a card is not the same as revealing it.

I'm not sure if the designers intended this, perhaps we will see an errata where "replace" is replaced by "reveal" ;-) But it definitely makes her more useful at the moment.

## 28 [radiskull on September 19, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53167-what-good-is-elanor/?do=findComment&comment=530117)

 For the record, I don't think Eleanor is supposed to work this way.  However, the FAQ says what it says, and hopefully if we keep coming up with strange cases like this, the designers will take note and introduce a higher degree of precision into both the FAQ/errata as well as the card text.

 

You don't owe me an apology :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]  I think what you're describing is certainly the intent of the rules.  However, the rules as written don't support that interpretation.

## 29 [Bohemond2 on September 19, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53167-what-good-is-elanor/?do=findComment&comment=530189)

I am not just talking about intent, I think that you taking liberties with the rules as written. You are focusing entirely on the word "reveal" and assigning absolutely no meaning at all to the word “replace.” The rules cover the situation quite well, and we should require designers to provide a lexicon which defines every word used in the instruction manual.

## 30 [radiskull on September 19, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53167-what-good-is-elanor/?do=findComment&comment=530209)

I am assigning meaning to the word "replace."  It just doesn't mean the same thing as "reveal" in the context of the game rules.

 

Rules for a game like this should NOT require a judgment call - they should be explicit in every respect.  I know you are joking when you ask for a lexicon, but I think that would be a good idea.  Especially once organized play starts, everyone in a tournament event needs to be playing by the exact same rules.

 

The fact that there is disagreement about this means that the designers need to clarify their intent, the card text, or both.

## 31 [Bohemond2 on September 19, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53167-what-good-is-elanor/?do=findComment&comment=530217)

The mere fact that players disagree does not mean that we need additional clarification. Players always find issues with which they will disagree. Tournaments don't function solely because of crystal clear rules which create unanimity. They function because they have judges and arbiters. And if you think those judges never make judgment calls, I would urge you to spend more time at CCG tournaments.

Also, we have yet to see any indication that the game is remotly viable in a tournament setting, because it lacks meaningful metrics for evaluating performance across games. (Personally, I don't think it should even try to bea tournament game, but that's another debate) So, arguing on the need for rules califications for a tournament setting strikes me as odd.

But I would like it this way. I am not trying to make the game easier on players but I often though her ability was pretty weak, and that it could just cancel without replacing. If it does replace and the possible new "when revealed" effect is not applied, it not only makes sense to me thematically but also makes Eleanor just about good enough, I think.

## 33 [Bohemond2 on September 19, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53167-what-good-is-elanor/?do=findComment&comment=530373)

Initially, I shared your opinion that Elanor was an underwhelming hero. However, the more I play (especially with the Mirkwood cycle), the more I encounter specific treachery cards that potentially devastate you. All encounter cards are not created equal. Hunt for Gollum has flooding and Old Wives Tale. Carrock has Roasted Slowly and A Frightened Beast. Rhosgobel has... well a ton of cards. But her ability to cycle through cards is essential in that scenario. Her ability to avoid these specific calamitous cards makes her quite valuable.


In addition, she becomes easier to field with more people. She may not excel in solo games, but is a stronger character in three and four person games in which you can afford to have her not commit to other activities and her ability to ward of disastrous treachery cards will come up more regularly. If treachery cards did not trigger when she used her ability, she would be, far and away, the best hero in the game.
r abaility to cycle throgh cards is essential in that scenario.

I would have to agree with this comment here. I think in solo games you are better off putting in three copies of A Test of Will when running the spirit sphere. This has the added benefit of just ignoring the 'when revealed' text and not having to draw another card off the encounter deck. Solo you really need heroes that can pull double duty and without any buffing Elanor just isn't a good choice for attacking or defending. 

## 35 [Svenn on September 19, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53167-what-good-is-elanor/?do=findComment&comment=530389)

There was actually a situation a friend and I happened into where a treachery card was revealed that was going to kill several allies and potentially 1-2 heroes as well. My friend was playing Elanor and was able to cancel this effect, essentially saving our game. I don't remember the replacement card, but as bad as it was it didn't end up killing stuff like the other one would have. That would have been enough to fail the quest for us as we were just barely questing enough anyway.

r abaility to cycle throgh cards is essential in that scenario.

 

 

I would have to agree with this comment here. I think in solo games you are better off putting in three copies of A Test of Will when running the spirit sphere. This has the added benefit of just ignoring the 'when revealed' text and not having to draw another card off the encounter deck. Solo you really need heroes that can pull double duty and without any buffing Elanor just isn't a good choice for attacking or defending. 



Totally agree. In the solo game she is ok but stil to weak as a hero. But in 2 or 3 players game she is really shining and can save the game for sure.

Although this interpretation would make her ability actually useful. But I agree that the second card should still be considered as "revealed", which makes her ability still suck. Worst hero in the game so far.



Are you kidding? The ability to dictate, at least to a degree, what treacheries will hit you is invaluable, especially in quests like J2Rhogobel. She might not fit your playstyle, but worst hero? C'mon. sorpresa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sorpresa.gif]

The guys posting above hit the nail right on the head. For a solo player, like me, she has next to no value. Weak quester, bad fighter, so-so defender, so-so ability. There's just no room for a hero that has such little flexibility in the solo game. Perhaps she is better in the multiple game. And I don't find her ability to be that useful anywhere because you have to get another card from the encounter deck. You aren't really controlling anything, because there's no telling what will come up. Her ability is a gamble and you are hoping for the best. Since she doesn't do anything else well, she is simply not worth it.

 Interesting posts and opinions. As I mentioned earlier I dropped Eowyn for her when I play two fisted.  She is just simply more versatile in these newer quests.

 

I tend to add extra shields to her also to make her quite a valuable defender.

I agree, partly. That is why it would only make things more interesting if the next "when revealed" did not resolve. Surely Eleanor still would not be overpowered, just compare her then to Éowyn or Legolas if you think so, but it would make the ability quite interesting, possibly getting rid of two nasty treacheries for one exhaustion. I will certainly play it so since the new FAQ suggests it strongly. I hope to get an official confirmation though.

I've been using Elanor in my hero since the start.  As people have already mentioned, her ability is quite situational, so it doesn't seem as good up front; however, cancelling exceptionally bad treachery cards has kept my heroes and allies time and again.  She as a low threat cost, and a solid 2 armor.  I usually put some Dunedain warnings on her so she can tank in her spare time , and sometimes my spare unexpected courage finds its way on her.

While I can see why people aren't too fond of her, I son't see myself faring near as well as I have without her.

We've recently played a couple of games with three and two players. I was playing Lore and initially used Frodo until we failed the Anduin scenario the first time. I then replaced Frodo with Eleanor as a way to 'dodge' all of the nasty 'Necromancer's Reach' cards which had basically been the reason for losing the game. This worked very well for us, resulting in an easy victory.
