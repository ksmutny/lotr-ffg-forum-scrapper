The shadow effect for Pathless Country (TBR) reads

An enemy is engaged with, and attacking, Player 2 in a 3-player game when Pathless Country is flipped. Player 1 uses Westfold Outrider to engage the enemy before the attack finishes resolving. Who does the enemy engage next, and why?

 * Player 3, because "next player" is determined at the moment when the shadow card is flipped.
 * Player 2, because "next player" is determined at the moment the attack is over.
 * Player 3, because "next player" is determined by the player that the enemy is attacking, which never changes.

We played 2, because we didn't think of 3, but on reflection 3 seems like the way I would play it in the future.

Here is a related ruling:

Q: I played a Knife in the Dark yesterday where a Ringwraith had two shadow cards when it attacked.  Both of the shadow cards were both Pathless Country, which says "After this attack, the attacking enemy engages the next player then makes an immediate attack."  How would this situation resolve?

A: In the situation you just described, the enemy will engage the next player after resolving its attack against you. Then it will make 2 attacks in a row against that player.

From the thread here [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/178369-double-engaged-next-player-attack-shadow-effect/].

I interpreted that to mean that "next player" is determined at the time the shadow effect is revealed.  That would be consistent with your options 1 and 3 above, but I don't know if we have anything official that suggests one over the other.
