Why do you think so?

Anyway, the POD mission packs for Death Angel cost about 5$. I have no idea how many cards they have, though. Is it the same #cards as M@O?

 Any word on how we will order this product? Everything I have seen so far has been rather vague.

M@O should be added as a purchasable item on FFG's website early in September.  After that all you have to do is click on the "Shop" link at the top of the page, go to the "Print on Demand" section, add M@O to your shopping cart, pay for it, and wait.
