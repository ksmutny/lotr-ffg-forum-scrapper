On the weekend of the 4. till the 6. of March an event called "Lure of Middle-Earth" will be happening. It is a yearly event, where about 100 people will meet for a weekend, to play the classic Middle-Earth CCG.

But since last year there also "Lord of the Rings LCG" players meet - and it will be even more this year. Last year we were about 20 LotR LCG players - this year it should be more when looking at the bookings.

It will be at Burg Stahleck, where also the yearly european "Game of Thrones" tournament is happening. This is in the German town of Bacharach, near Koblenz.

There will be also happening a Fellowship-Event for "Murder at the Prancing Pony" on Sunday there.
