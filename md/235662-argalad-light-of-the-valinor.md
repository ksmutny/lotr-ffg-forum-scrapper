Hi,

 

I wanted to confirm that the following combination would work.  Light of the Valinor attachment on Argalad, quest with him  and then use his action during the quest phase to lower the amount of enemy threat.  I appreciate your time.  Thank you!

Yep, that works.  After a character is committed to the quest, it doesn't matter if they exhaust later for something else.
