This Wednesday, 2nd of November. As per polish publisher.

That is similar to Germany: the German publisher announced on Friday that the APs are getting shipped to the stores and it will be available "next week" (=this week). Guess it will appear in German stores starting with today...

Guess, FFG will announce their release date later today.

On a side note: it seems that Return to Mirkwood and Khazad-Dum will both be released in December then. Maybe on the same day? (1st December?)

Maybe Mirkwood will be released in the last week of November and Khazad will hit stores in first week of December?

If Khazad-dum was shipped today, it would get to stores sometime between Dec. 6th and 23rd. Â That is going by their typical timeline on the Upcoming page, which I think is fairly accurate when dealing with products literally coming from the printing factory, and not sitting in a warehouse waiting for a release date.
