If you have a, say, Spirit card that costs 0 points, do you have to have a Spirit hero to play it?  I mean, it costs no points, right?  I was under the impression that you at least have to have a hero with a Spirit icon in order to play the card.  Thanks.

you have to have a spirit hero, or a hero with a spirit icon given to them though cards such as songs….only cards that any sphere can play are neutral

Ok, yeah, that's kinda what I thought, but I figured I'd check.  Thanks.
