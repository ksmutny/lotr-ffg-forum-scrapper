 When I played this card. This card is only for "monster" from encounter deck? I can't use it against shadow card effect do I have right?

"Cancel the "When Revealed" effects of a card that was just revealed from the encounter deck."

That's right, it doesn't work on Shadow Cards.

Right, it doesn't cancel shadow effects. It will, however, cancel ANY "when revealed" effect on an encounter card--be it an enemy, treachery, or location. So, it can cancel things like The Necromancer's Reach as well as the effect on Dol Guldur Orcs. It's not limited to "monsters."
