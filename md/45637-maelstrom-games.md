 Hi,

Did anyone here ordered LOTR:LCG from Maelstrom Games and knows when they will have the game in stock? I wrote an email to them asking about it but they didn't reply...

Pre-ordered from Maelstrom and haven't received it yet. Website says 30 April. They're probably closed over the Easter weekend, hence no reply.

My order was updated from processing to packing today. So it will be soon now, my precious.

My order is still "processing"... And their site still shows that the game isn't in stock and will be available 2011-04-30...

Received an e-mail earlier today that it has been dispatched. When did you order? I pre-ordered quite a while ago so may have been nearer the front of the queue.
