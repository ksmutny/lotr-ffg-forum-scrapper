One of the few games that C.E.O. of F.F.G. talked about in the slide saw of their In-Flight Report was LOTR LCG (also the only LCG) i think this means a lot for our beloved game, what do you think guys ?

I think they have a lot In store for LotR LCG both in the near future as well as in the long run. It's just hitting me as I'm writing that we might see another type of AP's but I'll post it in a new thread :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

However, I don't think they will give this game any more love than the Nettrunner LCG and Star Wars LCG. He mentioned them in the beginning as huge successes 2012-2013 and thus I think that these three games will get the same amount of attention. But that's not a bad thing ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

this game has had a very exciting few weeks, and its hard to believe that its future was questioned by some before hiers of numenor was announced.

 

still, i think this game's success is down to 3 things

 

1. the fans. middle earth has a fan base like no other. star wars is perhaps more numerous, but 'middle earthys' have been around longer ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

 

2. a great design team who have a genuine interest in the lore

 

3. amazing art. i think even players of other lcgs have to admit this game has the best art...it seems to be in a class of its own, and totally suitable for tolkien's work

I agree about the artwork.  the designers clearly encouraged their artists to draw some inspiration from the films, but not *too* much.  Moreso, they have a very clear, very deep indebtedness to the art of the 18th century Romantic period.  With it's rejection of industrialization, Enlightenment philosophy, and rationalism, and celebration of nature, emotion, tradition, etc., it's a very good match in style for Tolkien's work.  The use of color, highlight, sharp contrasts and light surrealism is a great match for Tolkien's superlative descriptions.  Good choice FFG!

good points, however i have read from one of the artists that they are told specifically to stay away from any film 'inspired' pieces....though that is of course a subjective statement, and im not sure what exactly ffg tell their artists. i suppose the balance of modern and classic pieces is effective, despite some being far too close to what i consider film pieces cough-merry-cough
