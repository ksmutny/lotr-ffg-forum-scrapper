During the Dungeons Deep and Caverns Dim quest, does Gollum get to attack more than once per turn? In other words, if I fail a riddle and he attacks, will he attack again if I fail a second riddle?

Yeah, he will.  Best way to get eaten.  After all, those are the rules of the contest.

That's what I was afraid of. Thanks!
