This is an issue getting product shipped from China and is completely out of FFG's hands. Still a bummer, though.

What a shame, but at least they announced it publicly, which is pretty respectable. Hopefully it won't be delayed for long.

Well, I guess we'll just enjoy the Treason of Saruman while waiting for the Lost Realm.

Uf, what a month. By other side, in spain, the prepaid Paypal targets have been crashed. I can't pay by internet way:

> Well, I guess we'll just enjoy the Treason of Saruman while waiting for the Lost Realm.

Treason wasn't specifically mentioned as being delayed but they did say all products would expect delay for a while to come. From this I expect Treason to also be delayed.

But not as delayed, as Lost Realm, because they haven't specificly mentioned it?

Does this affect European imports as well, or do they come directly from China to Europe? It's a real disappointment though for anyone in the US and hopefully it will be resolved soon.

Just thought I'd update that the union and shipping companies/ports association reached an agreement on Friday, so normal operations are resuming. That's the good news. The bad news is that it apparently will take awhile to get through the backlog. Who knows where The Lost Realm is in the scheme of things, but I don't think a delay of a month or two (or more) is out of the question.

Well I doubt they will start the cycle without the deluxe expansion that starts it off so I'm guessing it will... =(

Well, they will certainly not, but if I remember correctly, there was a HUGE gap between Voice of Isengard and first AP of Ringmaker cycle. That gap was due to design and manufacturing process, I presume. What worries me, is that now they will force the same gap onto the new cycle just to match the release schedule.

I can't see what benefit they could get from doing so...especially just to match a previous release shedule.  It'd be like always going the wrong way to the grocery store because you took a couple of wrong turns on the first time you went there.  I imagine any delays we see will be fresh, new delays rather than purposeful delays because Ringmaker took a while to get going.  

 

I could be wrong though...

Steward's Fear took a long time after Heirs as well.  At the time I wondered if they weren't adjusting some of the cards in the cycle after seeing how Heirs played out in the real world.  If that is happening then the cycle may be delayed too.

I wasn't playing back when Voice of Isengard came out... Did they announce the first AP as early as they did this time (with Wastes of Eriador)?

yup

Normaly between deluxe and first pack of the cycle about 6 months

I know this information has been posted from time to time on the forums, but I thought it could help given our current conversation.

 

The truth is that the time between the deluxe and cycle releases is all over the place. 

 

Core: 04/20/11
THFG: 07/21/11
Delta: 92 days (3 months)

 

KD: 01/06/12
TRG: 03/01/12
Delta: 55 days (1.8 months)

 

HoN: 11/26/12
TSF: 05/09/13

Delta: 164 days (5.4 months)

 

VOI: 02/21/14
TDT: 06/26/14

Delta: 126 days (4.2 months)

Yeah, I think the reality is that the release dates are largely out of the design team's and even FFG's control. That's why we see the gaps being all over the place. Once the actual design is done and an expansion moves into the printing/shipping phase, it's all up in the air. So I wouldn't worry about any forced delays between The Lost Realm and the first AP just to match previous delays (which were random), but given how things are shaking out, I think just everything will come out later than it would have otherwise.

Glaurung, I am sure it felt like 6 months! :-)

 

The "Wastes of Eriador" is scheduled for Q2 of 2015... We'll see how accurate that is, but I suppose it is possible considering the history.

"Fly Casual" for Edge of the Empire is now available, and that was on the same delayed list as Lost Realm.  Things are looking up!

(I know it isn't. I am just verbally processing my childish impatience. Here I am, a grown man, feeling like Christmas has been cancelled!)

Since I won't be able to get the expansion until a few months after it's released, what I really want now is the second hero preview we were promised.

Signs of hope: the Star Wars Armada Core Set, which was part of the delay along with The Lost Realm and is still listed as being on the boat, is due to arrive in retailers next week according to FFG's Facebook page. False hope? Or reason for celebration? You decide.
