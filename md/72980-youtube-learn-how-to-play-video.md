Hello all,

what is the best video to learn how to play this great game? I wish the multiple steps where somehow eliminated or morphed into one or two phases. that's the only thing that slows down the game i think, wish it was faster paced. thank you for insights and info.

well the only video i watched was the official ones before the game came out….they were ok i guess, though didnt talk about alot of the aspects of the game

have you tried the official ones?
