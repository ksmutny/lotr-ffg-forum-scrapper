I have not played any of the Saga expansions; I have focused on acquiring the "deluxe" expansions and AP cycles. The Black Riders looks fun, though. I have one question: Is it possible to play it with 2 players or more? Who takes control of Frodo? I'm thinking, since there is a limited number of hobbit heroes, that if 4 players want to take part, they all have to settle with one hero each. Is this correct? Thanks.

First Player gains control of Frodo.  Right, all players cant play all Hobbits, as there were not 17 Hobbits.  You do not have to only play with Hobbits, any hero is eligible.

I played it two-player, it's fun and thematic with one player controling Sam, Merry and Pippin, and the other Glorfindel, Aragorn and Fatty. With thematic decks scenarios were hard, but beatable.

Ah, I didn't know other heroes are allowed! Glorfindel and Aragorn do fit the theme.

If I have 4 players, do I need to buy two or just one?
(I have already got 2 core sets).

Thank you.

Guys, the questions you ask are so silly. "Is it possible to play with two players", "I didn't know other heroes are allowed", "Do I need to buy two saga boxes"... where are they coming from? You know, there are rules for each box on the support page of this site.

@doraemon0872:

 

 1st, welcome to the community.

 

On your question: You don't need 2 boxes.

Only if you really want/need more copies of the cards included in a certain box for multiplayer you should maybe get another box.

Thanks for the tip, but there is no need whatsoever to be derogatory.

I just don't understand how you come up with those questions. Taking your initial one as an example: LotR LCG is designed to be a 1-4 player co-operative experience and every their product since the release never, never limited the amount of players, and it never will. Even more, Black Riders expansions introduces a Peril keyword which makes sense only in a multiplayer game. Just try to use common sense sometimes, it works wonders.

In this case I agree, reading the rulebooks is a good idea before coming to the forums.

Yeah but there's no need to go out of your way to make the guy feel bad. 
These forums have a bad enough reputation as it is for being rude to people.

Let's try to change this!

My local group has been trying to play this thematically as well! These are great suggestions!

Haven't done anything bad, just asked him a simple question. If he felt bad about it - he probably should have thought before posting.

Anyone is welcome to post in this forum.  New players or players unfamiliar with aspects of the game are just as welcome as old forum trolls (more so?).

 

Be civil the way you would when speaking to people face-to-face.

Read the main post. He admitted he owns several deluxe expansions aswell as adventure packs. He is not a new player.

 

And I am speaking exactly the way I would speak to such person face-to-face.

Hi everyone,

 

Please remember that even when you believe you are communicating in a clear fashion, others may not always understand your intent. Keep the discussion respectful. 

 

You should find all the current rule sheets for The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game releases on that game's Support page – http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_minisite_sec.asp?eidm=129&esem=4 [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_minisite_sec.asp?eidm=129&esem=4]

 

Many of the questions you have asked will be answered by reading through the Core Set rulebook, as well as that of the expansion or pack in which you have interest. When you find yourself stuck or otherwise discover something remains unclear, then return to the forums and we will try to assist.

 

Best,

FFG Webmaster

Woah, I think that's the first time I've seen an admin step in.
