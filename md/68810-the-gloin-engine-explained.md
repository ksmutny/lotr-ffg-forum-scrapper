Howdy Forum,

 

there is a fresh article up over at cardgamedb. I am dissecting my Gloin Engine deck card by card and it contains a 3rd gameplay video (vs Watcher in the Water).

Check it out.

I like your videos so far, Plueschi. I have to get a bit used to your playstyle and that you're not playing for a good result. (I am also not sure if your deck is the right one against TWitW - I mean, no 5 HP hero to take Striking Tentacle's attack? You can't always rely on Sneak/Gandalf in your starting hand!)

 

Oh, and there has been one mistake at 09:22. You should have attached Striking Tentacle to Gléowine, not Grasping Tentacle. In this game it made no difference as you would have killed Grasping Tentacle anyway.

Ooph, those tentacle cards confuse the hell out of me. So, for the grasping tentacle, the rules are:

 

Forced: When Grasping Tentacle is attacked, discard the top card of the encounter deck. If that card has a shadow effect or is a Tentacle enemy, attach this card to an attacking character as a Tentacle attachment with the text: "Attached character's [Attack] and [Defense] are reduced to 0." 

 

So, which card gets attached? I've always read it, perhaps too literally, that the defending Grasping Tentacle is attached, because the other card is referred to as 'that card' and then you attach 'this card', which I took to mean the Grasping Tentacle. But now I'm not so sure.

 Heh, and a very nice deck, Plueschi. I like seeing other people's decks that get me thinking about combos I've never considered. Very cool. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I totally agree ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

But that is probably due to my style, too. I don't like to build a deck for just one scenario, but (hypothetically) for all scenarios. So the Watcher can screw me over pretty quickly with those Striking Tentacles. On the other hand, once I got a Citadel Plate or Boots from Erebor, the Watcher actually becomes pretty easy I guess.

But I digress, glad you like it.

Yeah, thats how I read them, too. But being a non-native speaker I dare not judge one way or the other ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

 I'm pretty sure that "that card" is the top card of the encounter deck, and "this card" is the Grasping Tentacle [what monkeyrama said]. That's how I read the English anyway.

The German translation seems to be pretty straightforward:

"Wenn die abgelegte Karte einen Schatteneffekt hat oder ein Fangarm-Gegner ist, wird diese Karte an einen angreifenden Charakter als Fangarm-Verstärkung angehängt…"

("If the discarded card has a shadow effect or is a tentacle-enemy, this card will be attached to an attacking character as a tentacle-attachment…")

Clearly refers to the discarded card.

 

Themewise your interpretation makes a lot of sense, as the Grasping Tentacle stops attacking while it tries to draw the character into the water which is why the character can't attack or defend. (but is able to both quest and to travel to distant locations…?)

But so does mine, as the Grasping Tentacle manages to grasp one of its attackers, making him/her useless for the rest of the fight while the tentacle is still able to strikeat the other attackers , using his victim as a weapon.

There is was mistake with Striking tentacle attack.

When striking tentacle attach you should discard top card of the encounter deck(to check it out undefended or not) but BEFORE you Declare a defender!

Cose attack is: Choose enemies who is attack then declare defender and so on. So you choose  tentacle, then Forced effect trigger: discard top encounter cards and then if attack is not undefended you choose a defender. Should be like this or?

this is in the errata

Dol Guldur Beastmster

CORE 91
Should read: “Forced: When Dol Guldur Beastmaster
attacks…”
The additional shadow card is dealt when the Dol
Guldur Beastmaster is chosen during step 1 of enemy
attack resolution.

so id say WHEN ATTACKS is this- step 1
