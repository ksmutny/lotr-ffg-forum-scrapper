As the questions says above.

A couple of us have managed 38 points in real life monosphere games - but for this thought experimant you can choose what you draw, and what the encounter deck draws, and use any (published or officially spoiled) player cards you like.

What is your lowest score and how do you achieve it?

EDIT: I meant Passage through, not Return to ... edited in topic line

Please read new FAQ. Scoring is completely different now, you add 10 points for every turn, which makes results like 38 not valid anymore.

For me, solo, best result was 99.

 I can engineer a turn 1 win with a score of 30.

Read this week's tournament thread - someone did it.  Awfully presumptious of you.

You should pay more attention when you read. Passage Through Mirkwood is a difficulty 1 quest from the core set (this is the one that you refer to , right? And yes, I can imagine score 38 for this super easy quest). On the contrary, this thread is about Return to Mirkwood, which is the 6th expansion of Mirkwood series. And no, 38 score is not possible for Return to Mirkwood.

How? Enlighten us! I can imagine that you do not draw any attercops, no treacheries that raise threat by 8 or instanly kill the hero.

But I can't really imagine how do you complete 4 quest stages in first turn. Please, tell us.

I assume the Bungo meant Passage through Mirkwood and not Return to Mirkwood. The score of 38 he was referring to happened on Passage through Mirkwood (under the new scoring system), thats why I immediately thought about Passage through Mirkwood without reading the title.

I however cannot engineer a turn 1 win against Return to Mirkwood, sorry for the confusion.

Well, maybe Bungo made a typing mistake when he was naming this thread. I wonder what was original intention, RtM or Passage?

Sorry guys I did mean Passage through Mirkwood. Oops.

Sorry for the confusion, this was meant to be a question about the "easy" quest from the core set.

38 was achieved in 2 ways.

I've been trying to figure out a turn one myself - using legolas to clear stage 2 after questing through stage 1 - but I haven't figured it out yet...

Legolas would place two progress tokens on the Old Forest Road I'm afraid.

 right........****, I had a variant with readying Zigil Miner with the Ever Vigilant Card.........Ok, back to square one again.

I think that´s the last time I try something like that.......

I achieved a score of -2 with Eowyn, Legolas and Beravor.

It´s crazy and you could probably get an even lower threat with the possibility to reshuffle you deck.

 

I will never do such experimental stuff again.........

But one thing is clear. Zigil Miner will be huge.
