# [One Deck to Rule Them All! - Post your &quot;Cannot Quest Without&quot; cards](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58802-one-deck-to-rule-them-all-post-your-cannot-quest-without-cards/)

CHALLENGE - If you had to build a player deck, for a SOLO game what would be your CORE list of cards?

I say "core" because, we all have the list of cards we like to throw in any deck we play with for any quest we play. Be that 30 cards with a 20 card variant for the specific quest. I want to know what your list of "cannot quest without" cards are.

THE KICKER - You can only use this one deck to play ALL THE QUESTS.

THE BONUS - If you had to choose AT LEAST 1 Hero to use for all quests, who would that be. If you want to list more than 1 hero that you would choose in this master deck, go for it.

DISCLAIMER - this is NOT A DISCUSSION thread. It is not meant to discuss each others deck choices, the "why's" or "why nots". It is merely a display of each of our "can't quest without" cards.

I'm not sure what you are asking? Do you want a all purpose deck? Because this isn't possible, nor is it how the game is designed imo. I think making full Cycle decks is very possible, and maybe, when the card pool is huge you will be able to build decks for everything.. but trying to make a single deck with no tweaks that can defeat every quest released is not really likely.

I am currently working on a Shadows of Mirkwood solo deck. It still needs some tweaking.. I am finding it hard to get a decent win ration on Journey and Return. The rest of the quests can be beaten, but getting the deck to beat Return breaks Journey and visa versa... as those quest have some VERY strict requirements. Especially in solo mode.. return is brutal in solo. Still I am confident I will get a CYCLE Deck out soon that I can post...

and I think this might be what you are after.. Decks for cycles... not for the entire game.. I really do not think that is every going to be possible.. not unless power creep after a few years makes the original quests completely trivial, and if that happens what is the point. I also think thematically it is fun to make cycle decks, as in a way it is all a single quest.

Either way I am also very interested in other peoples cycle decks if they want to post.. I'll post mine soon.

As for cards that are a MUST have in any deck.... I think this is pretty hard as well, as there are cards that should be in every deck of a certain type, but in every deck no matter what?

Well for solo, I like a Heavy Spirit/Lore with a leadership splash (experimenting with a 4 sphere deck at the mo and it is surprisingly crushing, I am currently playing Return with it and needed a quick break as it was so stressful!!) Still in all my solo decks I ALWAYS have...

Greeting, Steward, Sneak Attack, Tomb, Gandalf, Minstrel, UC - Leadership Song, I also use multi songs, so each hero gets a song eventually for every type, so you end up with 3 resources of each type for each mana colour you use. BUT, this is experimental, but I ALWAYS have leader song and steward.

I do not think a solo deck can function with out these cards, at least how i build them anyway.

As for my 1 hero? um... .. Elenore I think. Elenore makes any deck good, but Frodo is also beyond amazing I normally always have both these guys. Elenore makes there a zero fear of treacherys. You need to know what ones to let though as the surge efefct can screw you with her, but when you play a quest that can kill you with treachery cards.. well.. the quest just can't. Also frodo... this guy is the wall of all walls.. never will you die unless you die of 50 threat. Having frodo frees you to take more risks, as you know you can survive.

I agree, it is not really possible to make one all purpose deck. However, there has to be a list of cards you play almost all the time. That is what I want to know. What are the MUST HAVE cards in your player deck? The Hero was just a Bonus thrown in for the fun of it.

If people want to spin this into a "what sphere do you play a lot" then go for it.

 Must-have cards:

Steward of Gondor
Sneak Attack
Hasty Stroke
Test of Will
Unexpected courage
Gandalf
Northern Tracker

 

I'd say those are in 90% of the decks I build - obviously it depends a lot on context- if I've set myself a challenge to build a solo tactics deck to win a quest, then none of them will be in there.

Equally, it depends on player numbers. I prefer to play multi-player games, and I provide all the cards for the group, so if we've got 4 players, most things will be going in 1 deck, but only a few in each one.

In 4-player I'd very rarely bother with songs- maybe 1x song of travel so the Leadership player can carry a 4th Northern tracker/test of will/hasty stroke (have 2x core sets) but that's about it. With 1 or 2 player, songs are absolutely vital.

I laways say this: I never build up deck for the certain quest cose this is not fair in my opinion. Much more interesting build up deck for all scenarios.

Anyway we should to see tournaments rules but i think there will be no tournaments rules for solo only for 2 players game. Maybe there will be the rules 1 sphere can be used only once per player. I think is cool idea!!! There will be no 6 trackers or 6 Ggreetings and game will be more challenge. But looks like Kazad-Dum quite challenge already!!! Good!!!

Here is Deck list i build up to play against all quests

Total Cards (50)

Hero (3)
Eleanor (Core) x1
Glorfindel (Core) x1
Theodred (Core) x1

Ally (13)
Gandalf (Core) x3
Haldir of Lorien (AJtR) x2
Henamarth Riversong (Core) x2
Longbeard Map-Maker (CatC) x3
Rivendell Minstrel (THFG) x1
Gleowine (Core) x2

Attachment (25)
A Burning Brand (CatC) x2
Ancient Mathom (AJtR) x2
Celebrian's Stone (Core) x2
Dunedain Mark (THfG) x3
Dunedain Warning (CatC) x3
Forest Snare (Core) x3
Protector of Lorien (Core) x2
Song of Wisdom (CatC) x3
Steward of Gondor (Core) x3
Unexpected Courage (Core) x2

Event (12)
A Test of Will (Core) x3
Lore of Imladris (Core) x3
Sneak Attack (Core) x3
The Galadhrim's Greeting (Core) x3

This is old 3 months ago version and you can add some new cards but the main idea is work quite well.

Agree with your list. Only exclude tracker!!!! I dont like him!!! He is tooo powerful and make game to boring for me. I never use it!!! You play one card and whole aspect of the game is going down. I mean locations aspects. He desereve by taping 1 token on 1 location. Should be errata or somethings.....

Interesting topic!

Instead of giving you a list of cards, I give you my number 1 card effect, because this effect is way above other effects (in solo games at least) in my opinion and I would totally 100% include it in a "One deck to rule them all"...

 

The effect is: "Look at the top card of the Encounter deck". This is so insanely powerful in a solo game, that I'd never go without it under the circumstances you give.

 

This leads to some conclusions:

1. Play a stalling strategy against any non-Rhosgobel quest. You know the card that is coming? Fine, shoot for willpower-threat parity and never mind if winning takes you a copuple dozen turns.

2. Play Lore (and since you need to rush against Rhosgobel and Lore of Imladris is a Lore card, that greatly helps there)

(3. Since I am already playing Lore, I would probably add some Beravor shenanigans to recycle Sneak Attacks and other fun stuff)

I really never considered the importance of the cards that allow peaking at the encounter deck but reading your argument has really brought this to mind for me. Definitely a good idea!

I just got AP Frodo came in. I have not had the chance to play with him yet. If he is as you say, I am looking forward to it.

I was looking thru the deck builder and your qty is higher than the number in the set for some cards. Is that on purpose? I have the CORE, THfG, CaTC, and AJtR. I am looking at the deck builder program instead of my cards though. Maybe that is it.

Many people (myself included) buy multiple core sets to have multiple copies of all the cards since there are some cards that only come in quantity of 1 or 2. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

With this deck is quite good win ratio. About 60%-40% maybe even 70%-30% But Massing in Osgiliath is really nasty difficult to win. Then JTR also hard one. But other quests win almost every game. Sure no Dol-guldor. In my opinion is impossible solo.

Actually solo game is really challenge for me. But 2 players game i dont remember when we lose. Maybe 6 months before or something.......

Still wait for Khazad-Dum.........

Actually add me as a friend and you can see my results in quest log

I agree with plueschi. The most important effect when playing solo (single deck) is knowing what the encounter deck is about to throw at you. Especially if you don't care about your score, it allows you to pace your questing, build up your army and go through your entire deck in order to win almost any quest.

Thus, the most important cards would be Denethor, Hemanarth Riversong and Rumour from the Earth.

As you can see, my inclination is toward Lore for solo play.

Other essential cards include:

- Gandalf

- Steward of Gondor (until a better / more versatile accelerator comes up... will wait to see how Gildor and Zigil Miner combine)

- Sneak Attack

- Lore of Imladris (if you want your deck to beat Journey to Rhosgopel)

- Song of Kings

- Rivendell Minstrel (again, this is valid for as long as songs remain the primary source of "multi-coloring" your deck)
