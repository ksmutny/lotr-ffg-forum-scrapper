# [Escape from Dol Guldor (ONLY CORE SET CARDS) - PASS!!!](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99126-escape-from-dol-guldor-only-core-set-cards-pass/)

Hey - I´m so excited and I need to show it :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

After hours and hours I finally finished Dol Guldor just with the Core Set (2x Sets) Cards! ^_^ [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_happy.png]

I firts skipped the quest, thougt I won it with 2; 3 and 4 players and go on until I reached the last Quest of Khazad Dum. Here I decided not to go on until I managed the the unbelivable hard Dol Guldor with only the Core Cards. I tried endless times because I wouldn´t belive that it is unbeatable.

 

This is how I managed it:

 

I choose Leadership, because the are the only Sphere which can handle with the low resource, because it creates more by Steaward of Gondor. Also you can handle the first part with almost every mix of the two not caught heros. And finaly it has the best joker option Seak attacking Gandalf^^. I played with 30 cards (as the Core Set are) and try to hit and quest as fast and hard as I could. What means, if starthand has no Gandalf, Sneak attack nor Steward, give up ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

I don´t know how oftend I lost. I didn´t count. But it´s for sure something like 1 out of 50^^. But now I can say: It´s not unbeatable, quite the contrary. To my surprise it was many times very close  ^_^ [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_happy.png]

 

It feals great to beat it ^^ Thought it´s more luck than everything else xD

 

Did you beat that quest just with Core Cards? And yes with which Deck and points?

I had 148 points (49 threat - just one wrong card and I had died - but I didn´t :lol: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_laugh.png] )

as you can see at the Quest Log. I try to beat every Quest with every Sphere, so maybe somebody beat it with another sphere too?

 

PS: Still grining :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Uh,... congratulating? ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

 

Like, congratulating me when I'm finally going to smack Morgul Vale with a mono lore deck? :unsure: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_unsure.png]

Playing 50 games with a non standard deck and wining one isn't a feat to praise.. it is the laws of chance.

 

That is like saying if i sat there and flipped a coin 500 times and got a streak of 15 in a row of heads that is awesome, when in fact it is a act of futility.. maybe even with a dash of crazy stubborn ocd type stuff thrown in.

 

I mean yeah good on you.. but also.. are you serious? lol

I wonder, do you just constantly check the forums for every opportunity to piss in someone's beer?

And no, your signature does not give you license to be a jerk. This is a community filled with so many cool people, and a few orcs. Thanks for being the exception that proves the rule.

When i started to play to this game, i only had the core in front of me. I didn't know absolutely nothing about other packs, expansions, forums, etc. Only me and the core, nothing more.

I readed the rules 2 or 3 times and i played the first quest. I won, on the second or third time. After, Anduin, i didn't won. And i tried Dol Guldur.... agh! It was being impossible. :ph34r: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_ph34r.png]

I was wondering all the time :huh: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_huh.png] :huh: :huh: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_huh.png] :huh: if i was playing bad, if i might didnt understand any rule.

Ok, I think I get it now. I've been watching some of Don Rickles's, Jeffry Ross', insult comic sort of acts lately, not a style of humor I too often watch. We all experiment with certain kinds of humor at some point, and insult comedy is a difficult one to get right. But when you think in terms of very rough-cut insult jokes, you start to see that booored is experimenting with his own material, not being a troll. Problem with that kind of humor is that if your audience doesn't know that it's a bit, it sets a very different tone. Personally, I'm a big fan of satire; at least there, if a joke falls flat, I just seem like I had a boring opinion.

 

I think a mark of a great game is when it is fun even when you lose, and that's totally true here. I find Dol Guldor a bit too painful to revisit that often, but I'd definitely bring leadership to go after it for the same reason Legoland said; gotta make up for that lost resource!

I think all Beorn was trying to say is the the negativity on the forums is the exception to the rule that the LOTR:LCG community is typically one of nice, helpful people.

 

In other words, when you get the random negative jerk on the forums (the exception), it simply reminds us ("proves") that most players of this game are good people. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

@booored call me insane  - it´s ok. If you would see how oftend I tried some other hard quest until now - you would surly cry about it^^

 

But as camacazio say´s right, it´s so much fun in that game, finding out how to beat it. The quests are thematicly and it makes a lot of fun even to get beated ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

Of course the win of Dol Guldor is nothing else as luck! But hey, I had that luck and certainly you can lead you cards in your hand to stay with luck (by well thought playing). Combination of both let you through (or out :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]).

 

But we miss the point friends :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] I´m very intreted in the question I meantioned first. Because my statistic excel will beat every quest with every Speher :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] There he´s back again - psychiatrist :blink: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_blink.png]

This.

 

Legoland:There are many nice people in this forum who you can share you thoughts and for the rest you can just ignore them.As for the Dol-Guldur quest yes you need all the luck in the world to complete it but good job anyway.Really nice to see people enjoy this game so much.

I remember my first win against this quest was a two-handed game with the core-set Spirit and Lore decks (ah the old days of so little choice!). I won it with a threat of 48, at least two characters dead, and Gandalf facing down the Nazgul. Those core-set days were kinda wonderful, and even made me use a 12 threat Glorfindel! The horror!!

 

First wins against this one are always sweet!

Buuuuuut playing 50 times and then finally winning after being soooooooooo close once or twice a dozen of times - I mean yeah, if that doesn't make you excited, you're probably a psychatrist robot. At least Lego didn't wake his next door neighbours to tell them the breaking news!

Tell'ya what. "Typically" means not always, thus this rare negativity does not breaks the rule, which leads us to the conclusion it's not an exception. The jerk on the forum would be an exception if the rule was "there are no jerks on the forums", and if this would happen - then rule would be broken and cease to exist as a rule. This "exception proving the rule" thing is complete and utter nonsense.

I would describe it as wit and wordplay.

Can't believe I'm delving into this, but... Just because a rule has an exception, doesn't mean that the original rule is invalidated, otherwise the word "exception" would have no meaning and wouldn't exist. The rule "you may not park here" is not invalidated by the additional phrase "except on sundays". I'm not sure if you'd have much luck trying to make that argument to get out of a parking ticket!

 

Anyways, the phrase was used figuratively. The jerk poster is an "exception that proves the rule" because the fact that it is notable at all demonstrates the opposite pattern. If every poster or the majority were jerks, for example, then no one would notice. The fact that it is remarkable essentially proves the rule (or pattern, if you like).

"Except on sundays" is a part of the rule, thus has no effect on the rule itself. Exceptions does not prove the rules, try finding and exception in mathematics that proves the rule, lol. As soon as exception is found - it's no longer a rule.

I have to disagree, "No parking" is the rule. "Except on Sundays" is clearly an exception, that's why it uses the word "except". Sure, you can define it as part of the rule, but then the concept of "exceptions" loses all meaning. 

 

I think part of the problem may be that you are approaching this from the standpoint of mathematics, whereas the phrase itself comes from the field of law and social science (which would be more applicable to behavior on a forum). The exception, "you may park here on Sundays", proves that a rule exists governing parking in this particular spot depending upon the day of the week, even if you didn't know what the actual rule is.

If you post a rule "No parking", rule abiding ppl will never park there. They wouldn't know about parking during sundays being legal because you don't notify them about it. You must include it in the rule text, thus making it one with the rule.

I have finally tried this quest after setting the game for quite some time. I played two hands using decks found on this forum, created by Advosan in november 2012, and using only 1 core set. (for unknown reasons I can't paste the deck here and can't use the URL (the window doesn't want to close when I finish).

 

I must really be the worst player playing this game because I am playing easy mode, without dealing shadow cards and I never come close to beating step 1 of this quest, and I played for almost 3 hours. I was about to put the game in the garbage!

I also beat this quest with the mono leadership 30 card deck (3 Gandalf, removed Brok and Grim Resolve). Gloin captured, Celebrian Stone in starting hand. A Dungeon Jailor discarded and Objective, but it wasn't discarded as Shadow. I finished the quest after 15 rounds. Theodred died on 4th or 5th round, and Gloin died very late hummerhorned. 201 points for me.

 

Edit: Just to clarify,  I've done it just recently, I own the game since 2011. Have beaten it around The Hobbit release with a Dwarf Leadership deck.

I finally manage to beat this quest using cards from a single core set, playing 2 handed. 1 Hand was the spirit deck and the other a mix of the 3 other sphères using Theoden, Legolas & Denethor.

 

Denethor was the captive.

 

Finished the quest without a single hero dead and a score of 40 for the spirit hand and 44 for the other hand.
