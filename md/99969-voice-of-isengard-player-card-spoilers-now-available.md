This week's end is at hand... any chance of seeing encounter spoilers anytime soon?

Encounter text spoilers are available over at Lotrlcg.org. Now if you really wanna just see the art, as I did, images are over at http://deckbauer.telfador.net/cards.html&gameid=1&productid=174 [http://deckbauer.telfador.net/cards.html&gameid=1&productid=174], though watermarked.

Unfortunately, this week proved busier than expected. I am going to start on the encounter cards tonight and hopefully get them finished within the next few days.

Did you notice Legacy of Númenor is now Doomed 4 (instead of 3 as in the preview), it does make a difference...

 

[i did the usual mistake having been away for a while: haven't looked through the other threads, so I did not see the above had already been discussed; I agree the decision was a good one, I prefer being safer on the power-creep]

Yes it is a significant (and wise) modification. I'm still going to abuse that card :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Hall of Beorn card search now has all of the cards from Voice of Isengard, including encounter cards and quest cards. Enjoy, and happy Orc-Hunting!

It looks like you put Mugash in there twice. The second one seems to be replacing card #31.

Thanks for pointing this out. There is an objective version of Mugash and an enemy version of Mugash. The objective card (#31) was using the image from the enemy card. I have fixed this in the latest release. Let me know if you notice anything else.

Any chance of nightmare spoilers?
