We are group of three new players and we have played this game with three players even rules say it's for 1-2 players. Have you done any adjustments for game when played with three? The game might be little bit easier than two (or harder), I don't really know. Four players might be too many or what's your experience? I have four decks tho…

The game is easily playable with up to 4 players straight out of the 1 Core Set.  All you need is a way to mark the Threat Levels of the 3rd and 4th player.  Dice (D10) , tokens or paper and pencil work well.  The only difference in playing is during the Encounter step of the Quest Phase, you reveal more encounter cards as per the rules.  1 per player in the game.  Some scenarios - Escape Dol Guldur - are much easier with more players, but the extra encounters does level things up a bit.

It is easier to play with single sphere decks with more players, as each can concentrate on one of the strengths of each sphere.  One of this games greatest assets, is its adaptability.  Great solo - even playing 2 or more groups.  Fun team play - find your own level of 'communication' between players.  Infinite themes - try Dwarf, Rohan, Eagle, Silvan etc., decks.  This last becomes better with the expansions.

Have fun enjoying it with any numbers!  I am sure some people have tried with more than 4 players.  Wild!  Cheers!
