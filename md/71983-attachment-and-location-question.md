 Just started playing the game and I have two basic questions. 

Playing the intro Passage Through Mirkwood quest with a Spirit deck.   

Question one:  Can you attach the card " The Favor of the Lady" to a the same hero twice?  In other words can Eowyn's Spirit go from a base of 4 to a 6? If so can all attachments stack unless otherwise stated?

Question two:  When playing the Northern Tracker and using his response to place a progress token on each location in the staging area can he place a token on the quest? Do quest cards count as locations in this circumstance?

Thanks for taking the time to help a newbie player.
