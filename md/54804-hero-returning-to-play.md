What are the possibilities for a hero that was discarded (e.g. killed), reshuffled into the play deck with a Will of the West and drawn again?

Is he/she just a dead card for Eowyn's ability? Or can I play him again?

If yes, how does it work? Do I have to pay his Threat cost again, can I play him for free, do I have to pay his Threat cost in resources?

I wasn't able to find anything about this, but maybe I simply looked in the wrong places...

Thanks.

Dead heroes are never shuffled into the player deck. If you'd use Will of the West all cards get reshuffled except the dead hero and the WotW Event card itself.

Edit: Rulebook, p.20

The only way to get a dead hero back I know of is to use "Landrovals" Response ability or "Fortune or Fate".
