Above the main body of the post is a gray bar with the date of the posting, there should also be an Edit button as well. Annoying if you ask me. You'd think there would be a big button like the Quotes or Reply buttons...

This seems to work only for a few minutes. Any idea how I can edit them later without the trick of saving the url?? ( as someone suggested )

I'm not sure. I didn't even know it had a timer. Who thought that was a good thing!?

Nope. Unless you manage to convince FFG to install a decent forum software rather than using this §&%$... enfadado.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/enfadado.gif]
