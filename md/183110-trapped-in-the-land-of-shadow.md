This is interesting. The trap archetype is much strengthened by Damrod and all the other allies. Anborn, while amazing with Faramir, will be kind of a tough choice since the other version is really good with traps, but I like the synergy with Faramir. Overall this doesn't seem that powerful in the current meta since many enemies are either immune to player card effects or attachments, but for the earlier cycles this looks really good! Losing ally Faramir is bad, but if using Visonary leadership or Sword that was Broken you can compensate for it. I like this! The art is really good as well. Looking forward to this expansion!

I think this makes Anborn the first character to have two different non-objective ally versions of himself in the game?

Mablung is going to be a nice ally too. 2 willpower, 2 hit points for 2 resources with a useful effect? Sign me up.

Ambush seems kind of dope. I am glad that traps are getting a bit of a buff, and I also like that there's more of the dunedain type of ranger synergy in that as well. Can't wait!

That's alot of spoilers!

Does this hint at LoS being available at gencon maybe?

Love the Damrod hero.

Faramir is good, in combo with so many allies, but I worry for him, as his ally version is so strong.

Mablung is great too, for exactly the reasons Chris gave.

Anborn is meh imo. Or maybe I'm missing something?

That's what I was thinking too! Crossing my fingers...

 

Anborn helps to keep dangerous enemies in the staging area, or bumps up their engagement costs to feed Ranger/Hobbit abilities if you do engage them. The damage could also be useful if you combine it with Ranger Bow. The biggest problem is actually that the Lore version is so good for trap decks too.

 

Man, I have to say that I like every single one of these cards. I've been waiting for a card like Ambush forever!

Anborn will be very important in this deck. It is the only repeatable means of raising an enemy's enagement cost, which seems to be a main mechanic for this deck (another reason to add x3 Take no Notice). With Faramir he can raise the engagement cost of an enemy, then you engage it and play In the Shadows, and then ready him with Faramir and attack for 3. I like him.

Ah, of course, forgot the obvious one. Anborn is still second though I think.

Wow, I am so excited to try a trap deck now!  Mono-lore is probably still the best with Damrod, Mirlonde, and maybe Haldir.  I'll probably stick with the lore Anborn ally though.  Mablung ally is very good, even just for the 2 WP and 2 HP with only 2 cost.

 

I'm not sure who to best pair with the new Faramir.  I'm thinking Halbarad or Tactics Aragorn.

## 14 [Edvando on July 23, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/183110-trapped-in-the-land-of-shadow/?do=findComment&comment=1701921)

The main problem of relaying on Anborn to increase enemy engagement is his very high cost.

## 15 [John Constantine on July 23, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/183110-trapped-in-the-land-of-shadow/?do=findComment&comment=1701922)

I think, new Faramir would be good with da Celeborn, to get most out of dat inflated 1 turn stat silvan allies.

The obvious pairing for new Faramir is old Mablung. They both trigger off engaging an enemy, limit once per phase.

I forgot the limit once per phase, so Halbarad makes less sense.  Mablung and Aragorn would be a good combo with Faramir.

Yes, I like that Faramir will work in other decks as well. With Imrahil he can ready an ally you used to quest so he can chump-block, which could work really good. Others have noted how he works with Aragorn and Mablung. Literally the only drawback to him is the inability to use his ally version!

Really cool stuff here, new Damrod makes me want to try Imrahil-Damrod-Denethor as a Gondor deck.

 

Seems to be a new trend to let Lore have a bit more willpower-efficient allies, which is a very good thing in my opinion.

 

Also, that Mablung art... totally my doppelganger :blink: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_blink.png]

Oooh, shiny. The new Faramir is really good, and I like that he works as a support for other allies (not unlike his leadership ally, but in a different form). And the new traps and allies that work with them are really nicely thought out. I'd better get on with playing the Treason expansion so that I have time for this one, because it looks exciting. And the design is just getting so slick these days. Mighty impressed.

I think I might even be able to order The Two Towers saga expansions together (still haven't ordered Treason). That'd be pretty cool.

Love the new ranger cards, and loving that we get synergy between Dunedain, Gondorian rangers, and Hobbits.  It's both fun and thematic.  Love that they're breathing new life into old archetypes that need it, and love a hero Faramir that I actually can use.  

Readying an ally is such a unique ability.  Only three cards I can think of that do it: Ever Vigilant, Call to Arms and Spare Hood and Cloak (aside from allies like Gandalf and Treebeard that already have readying abilities), and you could really get bonkers with some engagement shenanigans and new hero Faramir.  Lots of fun possibilities to consider.

I'm going to pair the new Faramir with Leadermir, and Leadergorn, this should give a Gondor deck with strong allies extra activation. The other deck I will probably use Damrod, Beregond, and Beravor, for traps and some more gondor allies.

I think it's time to retire the phrase Leadermir, because it now applies to two heroes.  Also, Core-agorn is far better than Leadergorn if you ask me.

Why not, so then Dead-o-mir and Nume-mir, and Far-giliath and Shado-mir?

I like it!  Far-giliath is my favorite.  It sounds like someone from the first age.

I have to say that I am not as impressed with Faramir as others are. I think this Faramir is best outside of a ranger/trap deck as his ability seems to contradict what ranger/trap decks like to do which is avoid engagement. Damrod and the other allies fit perfectly into that archetype, and those I do like. And if I am taking Faramir outside of the ranger/trap archetype, I think I'd rather use the ally version as I feel it would serve me in a wider variety of cases.

I guess I am just a little disappointed that It wouldn't help me to have Leadership Faramir "leading" his rangers in their own deck type. It seems that both Faramirs contradict, at least thematically, the archetype they are associated with given Lore Faramir's high threat cost and this ones engagement bonus. Maybe I am missing something that others see, if so help me like "shado-mir"

Well, there are two different types of ranger archetypes.  There is the lore/trap style (Against the Shadow Gondor Rangers) that avoids engagement, then there's the Leadership/Tactics Dunedain style (plus Mablung) that rewards engagement.  There is some thematic blurring between Gondor and Dunedain, but the new Faramir fits into the Dunedain style.  He's only Shado-mir because he comes from the Land of Shadow box, not because he lurks in the shadows.  Old Faramir is still kind of in no-man's land, but he is a better fit for the trap style.

I do see the possibilities of putting him with the Dunedain, but it just seems that the other allies fit well into what I should have specified as the Lore/Ranger archetype in my previous post, but Faramir does not. I have found, despite my attempts to the contrary, that Lore Faramir doesn't fit well into the trap archetype either. Loragorn is a much better fit solo, and thematically as you can go into "stealth-mode" once threat gets too high. I see this as a missed opportunity to make a better Faramir and improve the original archetype, instead it seems they come out of left field and tell us that Faramir is ability-wise a Dunedain And not a Gondorian Ranger that he is. And it just doesn't seem right thematically in my opinion.

## 35 [Narsil0420 on July 24, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/183110-trapped-in-the-land-of-shadow/?do=findComment&comment=1702213)

It's an interesting challenge that I think just inspires me to have to think creatively about whether to engage or not. The new trap and event also encourage selective engagement of enemies so there's room for both. Maybe what we're looking at is more like the Hobbit strategy of keeping your threat low and selectively engaging enemies to get the most bonuses out of it. 
I do really prefer the non-engagement, damage in the staging area approach and always am looking for new cards to encourage that strategy. One thing I've learned is that it's hard to accomplish that purely in a solo game. I got very disappointed trying to do that with Lore Faramir back in the day. Having a pair of decks that compliment eachother in this regard are necessary. As the designers said, these rangers pair very well with Hobbits. So what I'm thinking about right now is some creative way to divide up the Hobbit and Ranger heroes to have one deck take the enemies (with Leadership Faramir) and the other benefit from non-engagement (ie with Haldir).

Maybe there is a way to use both engagement and non-engagement decks in a mutually beneficial way.

Yeah, Ambush with lore Anborn and the new Damrod and Faramir heroes could be good. 

 * Exhaust Anborn to return Ambush from discard pile.
 * Play Ambush for 1
 * Ambush attaches to enemy (draw a card)
 * Engage and ready Anborn, so he can contribute his 3 attack to the ambush.

If you could manage to use Faramir hero to ready Faramir Ally, that would be too much power. I´m happy we can avoid that =X

Yeah, I find it weird that Leadership Faramir has a Dunedain ability. His ability can work with his trap friends in some decks more focused around Ambush instead of Poisoned Stakes, but still weird. I would be more thematicaly happy if that ability was attached to a Dunedain hero.

 

Anyway, all cards that where spoiled in this news were awesome! (if you discount In The Shadow, which sucks).

New Faramir does synergize with the Gondor Rangers who exhaust before the Combat phase to do interesting things (of which there are a few). Plus, Ranger Bow. I'm not sure it's really a thematic miss.

What's the benefit of Ambush vs Ithilien Pit beyond the fact you can strike first? Is the 1 extra cost and discard worth it? Ithilien Pit is good if you're not engaged since you can smack the enemy around in the staging area so there is no danger of it attacking you anyway. I primarily play solo so I guess when the enemy does engage, Ambush is superior. hmm... seems like getting the right traps on the right enemies will be a big challenge and strategy to the deck.

Does Ambush let you attack the same enemy twice in one round?

Yeah. Ambush works on enemies that engage you as well as ones which don't (and indeed allows you to gain benefits from engagement, with e.g. Faramir/Mablung/Pippin, which now I say would probably make for a pretty good deck, we can do the Faramir/Ent combo as well). Also, if we're looking for means of killing enemies without them attacking you, this way you can have six in your deck rather than three, doublling the chances that you have one at a relevant moment.

And I agree. I think the less-used traps (i.e. the ones which aren't Ranger Spikes) would turn up a lot more if they actually let you choose if an enemy tripped them or not. Maybe that would be too good. Or alternatively, if they just added to all the traps "Limit one Trap attachment per enemy" so you could put multiple into the staging area without them all hitting the same enemy and wasting half the effects.

Yeah, Ambush can help another player. But so can Ithilien Pit. All players can dog pile that poor enemy in the staging area or otherwise haha. I do play solo, so those aspect won't see much play from me. You make a good point and 6 cards vs 3 and the synergy of engagement. More options is nice.

 

> Does Ambush let you attack the same enemy twice in one round?

 

I think so.

I think I am having a mindgasm over this article. AMAZING art on all these cards and some REALLY solid new player cards.

Trap decks far more viable now, new Fararmir hero is AWESOME and will be in lots of decks I think especially with so many great unique allies that have come out recently (Treebeard, Legolas, Gimi, Ingold and more) and the fact he works very well with Tactics Aragorn and Mablung. His ability is also very useful in quests that have enemies jumping out at you during different phases like staging. Ready one ally when a nasty foe engages you during the quest phase and then ready another during combat when further enemies engage you. With strong unique allies out getting to ready two of them is pretty powerful, with allies like Beorn, Gandalf, Legolas, Gimli, Boromir etc this is almost as good as readying two heroes!

I REALLY love the concept behind the two ranger allies. Adding to an enemies engagement cost is a very cool ability and can buy you time against a nasty foe you are not ready to take on. Mablung ally can even return a nasty foe you are already engaged with back to staging and keep him there by raising its threat! This could be comboed with Dunhere or Haldir to kill foes in staging. Anborn is even better and can increase an enemies engagement cost every turn and also does 1 damage to them whilst doing so!! If you theoretically used this every turn it could really give a strong boost of power to a low threat, secrecy or staging area attack deck. It both weakens (direct damage) and keeps enemies unengaged every turn! If your threat gets too high or the ability stops being useful you instead have a 3 attack ally instead. 

The event and attachment are both epic as well!!! The new trap is insanely cool! Quick Strike but you can attack with as many characters as you want!!! I think this may very well be going in my decks ASAP! 

 

also we are getting spoiler articles so often! I love it!!! KEEP THEM COMING FFG!!

Ok, how about this for a three player set up:

 

Faramir(Le), Sam, Pippin(Lo) - 25 (Starting Threat) Engages enemies

 

Damrod, Mirlonde, Haldir - 23 - Trap Deck

 

Merrry (Sp), Fatty, Glorfindel - 18 - Keeps everyone's threat low and quests

Looking at such a deck (Faramir + Ents) in a different perspective, without relating or knowing anything about LOTR, I think a guy commanding an army of Treefolk essentially is pretty awesome, so I give it a pass.

I like this whole box in general already, and we haven't even seen every player card... How many are there in this box? Anyway, this whole batch of cards feels very Robin-Hoodsy and I really like that. The art has a lot to do with it. The art on Damrod is particularly good to me.

I am glad I am two for two in guessing the heroes in the upcoming saga: Faramir and Damrod, even with the spheres. I hope I am as effective with the rest, though (good) surprises are always welcome, too.

> I have to say that I am not as impressed with Faramir as others are. I think this Faramir is best outside of a ranger/trap deck as his ability seems to contradict what ranger/trap decks like to do which is avoid engagement. Damrod and the other allies fit perfectly into that archetype, and those I do like. And if I am taking Faramir outside of the ranger/trap archetype, I think I'd rather use the ally version as I feel it would serve me in a wider variety of cases.
> 
> I guess I am just a little disappointed that It wouldn't help me to have Leadership Faramir "leading" his rangers in their own deck type. It seems that both Faramirs contradict, at least thematically, the archetype they are associated with given Lore Faramir's high threat cost and this ones engagement bonus. Maybe I am missing something that others see, if so help me like "shado-mir"

I think the Lore Faramir hero is still meant for the trap deck. Leadership Faramir into a deck with strong allies and a higher threat.

>  
> 
> > What's the benefit of Ambush vs Ithilien Pit beyond the fact you can strike first? Is the 1 extra cost and discard worth it? Ithilien Pit is good if you're not engaged since you can smack the enemy around in the staging area so there is no danger of it attacking you anyway. I primarily play solo so I guess when the enemy does engage, Ambush is superior. hmm... seems like getting the right traps on the right enemies will be a big challenge and strategy to the deck.
> 
> Yeah. Ambush works on enemies that engage you as well as ones which don't (and indeed allows you to gain benefits from engagement, with e.g. Faramir/Mablung/Pippin, which now I say would probably make for a pretty good deck, we can do the Faramir/Ent combo as well). Also, if we're looking for means of killing enemies without them attacking you, this way you can have six in your deck rather than three, doublling the chances that you have one at a relevant moment.

Haha I love the brutal honestly of "the ones which aren't ranger spikes". Couldn't agree more re the limit one trap per enemy to make them a little more powerful especially due to how many enemies cannot have attachments.

Faramir aka hardest choice between hero and ally (even more than big G for me).

 

2P:

L. Faramir - L. Boromir - Imrahil/L. Aragorn - lets lead the army of allies of Gondor to victory (Supported by Beregond - Eleanor - Eowyn (wife of Faramir) from across the table ), gather resources (Steward, Horn, Gondor Events,...) and let the Gondorian Fire and Blood of Númenor and even Steed of the Mark do their job.

Of course Visionary leadership, Sword that was Broken, Captain of Gondor, Shield, Raven winged helm for Beregon, For Gondor for key moments and/or battle/siege questing, Add Ingold/Denethor hero via that new attachment, .....

 

 

L. Faramir - Mablung - T. Aragorn (Let´s engage all the enemies) 

Damrod/Haldir - Pipin - Merry (Keep it secret, keep it save) 

Use Lore secrecy scrying to know when to lay traps, resourcefull, Ithillien lookout,.....

More secretive version: swap T.Aragorn with Sam, engage when you want and profit for all your heroes.

Also this version would be very thematic for this expansion.

 

 

So many possibilities....

And Anborn is excellent. Repeatable dmg, combine with traps, Ranger bow, Gondorian Spearmen and Spear of the Citadel

I was thinking of something like that. When I do this, I will certainly go all Gondor, though. It shall be Boromir, Faramir, Imrahil (a family) in a mono-Leadership on one side and Beregond, Damrod and either Denethor or Eleanor on the other. I think Denethor will probably win it though I like to play the ally version in the mono-Leadership (mostly for theme and wonderful art). Spirit doesn't have much Gondor love and its best is for mono: Shipwright, Emery; only Blood of Númenor and Lampwright (who is weak) that I can think of enhancing the deck.

By the way, I am loving the previewed cards. Pretty much all of them.

Faramir is excellent. Of course his ally version is one of the strongest willpower boosting cards in the game (if not the) but I have grown tired of him, quite a bit, as it puts some other cards to shame (like his father ally). I will play this hero instead, gladly, as the Lore hero is...

Anborn is excellent too. Even if you don't make the whole strategy around him, of course, just his attack with Boromir is amazing (and in sphere, this time).

Mablung. 2 willpower for 2 cost plus an ability, one cannot complain, can he? 2 hp, 2 attack with Boromir: gold.

Damrod. Maybe the best of them still, I am not sure of course, but this guy has both resource acceleration and draw engine built-in. And he is a decent quester. 9 threat and Visionary Leadership make him just superb.

Ambush. Great to see more traps. And Damrod will make them much more efficient. I had already liked Ithilien Pit, and this is similar from a slightly different angle. It pays off having Denethor hero for them, I'd say.

In the Shadows. Well, I think this is surely the weakest of the bunch (but what a bunch it is). I like any card that has a synergy with hero Beorn though (and he can help you from the other side of the table).

Anborn is competing with itself. I would much prefer that we could play both Anborns, so my wish is that he had another name. Same problem with Mablung.

 

In the Shadows should really give -2 atk and -2 def. That is a binder card. It has many restrictions, it need you to have only rangers+hobbits (not necessary but overly advised), only target enemies engaged with you and the enemy need to have a higher engagement. Also, if you lose one hero, sunderly this card cost more.

Yes, as I said above, I can't really see In the Shadows to be very strong, certainly very iffy. If you have low threat, you probably don't have many enemies engaged, etc.

I wonder about the weapon. I feel, it being Leadership, it might not directly deal with attack. Yes, Faramir's 2 attack is not amazing, but I think you chiefly want him for questing, especially in the beginning. There are other ways to accumulate attacking strength in Gondor deck.

Anborn and Unseen Strike seem like a cool combo you could pull off if you were so inclined.  Not sure how to build a deck around that but it could be interesting.

I am excited about having a Ranged hero in Leadership, who is bereft of the trait except for Hirulin the Fair as far as I know.

Also Faramir+ Aragorn(Tactics) is pretty great.

I know. Beside Hirluin (and the Lore version) Faramir is the only ranged hero who doesn't have 3 attack strength, I believe. Well, Gondorian Fire could help but it is not in-sphere.

Faramir will combo well with the Warden of Annuminas the 4 cost Spirirt Dunedain ally who gets +1 wp for each enemy engaged with you. I remember people were complaining how if you have so many enemies engaged with you to make questing with him worth it your going to need lots of combat help. Now you can give this ally some readying ability by questing, and having him back to fight.

You get 3 copies total of cards with the same name.  I've seen this question with regard to the two Gandalf allies and, alas, you can't include 3 of each.

Each trap we have at present, including Ambush, aims to give you a way of permanently dealing with an enemy.  Either keep it out of combat (Ranger Spikes, Forest Snare), deal damage to it (Poisoned Stakes -- too slow!), or give you an extra way to attack it (Ithilien Pit, Ambush).  So right now it's a waste if you're playing more than one trap per round.  We need some way to get traps into play after the planning phase. A Response event that works after an enemy enters the staging area is the most obvious solution, and I'd be surprised if we didn't see something like this eventually.  Maybe 0 or 1 cost and you still need to pay the cost of the trap itself. 

 

That, or continue to develop the 'Ithilien ranger' archetype so that trap decks can do more than rely on traps.  We have a handful of effects that don't yet amount to a solid strategy in itself (+engagement cost, -enemy stats, a couple of direct damage effects, engage enemies or return them to the staging area), but can play into other traits (Hobbits, Dunedain Rangers).

I agree with you. Also, the +- engagement are pretty unreliable or very costly (same with direct damage). Also, the newer quests generally comes with more doomed or raise threat effects then older ones.

 

The "trap" deck is a enemy focused deck, but one of the main problems is that it can only deal with one enemy every round, maybe two but at a cost, while good tactics decks can reliable engage, defend and attack with little cost most of the time.

I think it work best as a ally card instead of a event, to be repeatable. A event for that effect, even costing 0 resources, but one card, would still be costly for the deck.

One of the basic flavors of Traps is that you can't predict which enemy will be get stuck in your trap (without scry). To preserve that but still allow more than one useful trap per round, you could do this:

 

Response: After a trap is attached to an enemy, pay 1 Lore resource.  You may play a Trap card into the staging area (you must still pay the Trap's cost).

I was thinking of a new type of trap that would play into the engagement area instead of the staging area....

 

Tripwire

1 cost Lore attachment

Trap

Play into the engagement area.  Attach to the next enemy you engage (limit 1 tripwire per enemy).  Until the beginning of the next round's combat phase attached enemy cannot attack.

 

I guess it is really a Feint in Lore with the restriction of having to play it during set up, but the advantage of lasting longer.  Still a bit more controllable that many of the other traps since we might be able to decide who to engage.  Thematically, it is based on the idea than enemy coming to engage you wanders into an area that you have prepared, falls down on the tripwire and looses the ability to act....giving us a free swing.

 

 

Falling Net

1 cost Lore attachment

Trap

Play into the engagement area.  Attach to the next enemy you engage (limit 1 Falling Net per enemy).  

Action:  Exhaust Falling Net to declare an attack against attached enemy.

 

Doesn't stop the enemy from attacking, but gives you more options about how to handle it (attack at appropriate time, then attack again early in next turn before enemy can swing again or ignore enemy this round to deal with other enemies, but then kill him next turn before he can strike again.  Thematically I don't have as strong a case for this one, but suppose you could go with the idea that net hampers his movement enough to make him vulnerable.

 

 

Seems like playing into this area could be a nice addition to the Trap arch-type (which I really like, but haven't been super successful with). 

 

Thoughts?

 

Edit:  Whoops...just looked again at the spoiled cards and realized how similar to Ambush Falling Net is...Oh well...

My personal favorite idea that I came up with is similar to Hands Upon the Bow. Whether it is on an attachment or an event or something, I don't know but the effect would be something like this:

 

Response: After a trap card is attached to an enemy in the staging area, exhaust [attached hero OR a Ranger character OR any number of Ranger characters] to immediately declare it as an attacker (and resolve its attack) against that enemy.

 

If I made it an event where only one character would attack, I think I'd just make the enemy have -2 def to help out. The only thing that sucks about this idea is that all of the traps are designed to do something counter-intuitive to what this card does, which means I'm pretty much "wasting" the trap just to be able to use this effect. If they made a new trap like "Stuck In The Bog" or something that represented holding an enemy still so they weren't able to defend themselves effectively, then make it just give an enemy -2 defense or something like that, it would probably be helpful for this effect.

I really want to utilize the archery skills of Rangers and other direct damage cards. New Anborn, Ranger bow, Poisoned stakes, Forrest patrol, Spear of the citadell, Gondorian Spearman, Mighty Prowess, Ranger of the North, Ambush (or if you want to go out of Gondor/Ranger theme even Execting mischief, Descendant of Thorondor or even Thalin) and add Great Yew Bow (yes, even better for old Faramir). So many ways to kill enemies before they can attack or even engage. I wonder if it would be viable strategy. Combine with low threat (Hobbits) and it could really work.

I have just made a new proxy support deck: Damrod, Beregond, Denethor. A nice Gondor theme and a ton of direct damage. I stayed with theme, as usual, but I did include Expecting Mischief (neutral theme I would say though it has Thorin art) which is great with Denethor. It is made to support my mono-Leadership Gondor deck of Boromir, Faramir, Imrahil. Of course, these will probably not be very useful against Uruk-hai but any quest with many lower hp enemies should be good. Many enemies in general, I am hoping, because the bigger ones can be slain in combat, the Leadership deck is very good at that. I love the idea of direct damage though, and I have been desperately trying to make the mechanics work. The new cards certainly give hope.

 

I actually want to ask something. Can the Leadership Anborn kill an enemy when it is revealed, without resolving surge and/or "when revealed" effect, just at Thalin does? I am guessing not because the card says "after" but it would make the ability very useful.

You can see that answer is "no" if you simply compare their card texts.

Well, this is exactly how ruling in this game does NOT work. But as I said, I would agree.
