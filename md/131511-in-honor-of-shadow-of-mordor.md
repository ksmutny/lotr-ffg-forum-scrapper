I just got bored one day and decided to make these. 

They're probably not that balanced or feasible, but I thought they'd be fun to play with!  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I could also make certain events that have to do with his abilities, like Wraith Punch, Dominate, etc.

I haven't played Shadow of Mordor but from what I know it definitely fits the theme. I'd probably put the bonus stats description on the attachment, though, and include some kind of penalty for Talion leaving play (maybe a large threat raise or something?) I think he seems pretty unstoppable otherwise.

Action: exhaust Talion to place all his damage to an enemy. Talion can't be ready till next round.

 

 

Could be nice!

Maybe this response will fit better the theme:

Response: after Talion is destroyed, put him back into play. If an enemy destroyed him, that enemy gains +2 attack and +1 defense.

Talion only can attack once per round.

Response: After Talion damages an enemy resolving an attack, that enemy make an immediate attack to another enemy (not deal shadow card)
