 Blah blah blah, tournament blah blah

 

"Middle-earth is a place of wonders and magic, but it’s also a world of myriad untold perils. Participants in The Lord of the Rings Fellowship Event will be the first to blaze new trails into the heart of Mirkwood, one of Middle-earth’s darkest, deadliest, and most infamous realms."

 

New quests? Mirkwood? Discuss

as on my other post, given people are talking about these weather cards (or whatever ffg  make) i think the 'darkly' means new encounter cards to be put in with core set mirkwood quests

so no new quests, just old ones made harder

They might also introduce some new quest cards that leverage the old encounter decks, plus a few new encounter cards.  Some new quest cards would really enable some good replay value for the old encounter decks.

These events are going to be a lot of fun. The few new encounter cards will be great, but the real fun will be had when you meet and play with like minded people in your area. I've met some of my best friends through programs like this. I highly recommend you give this a try if you're able.

 The idea of creating upgrades for the old quests (to preserve their difficulty in line with the release of new cards) is a very good one. If this isn't what they intend to do, I hope that they do it in future.

I think I just about exploded with excitement when I read the full article! Tournament stuff aside, the idea of producing extra cards that the sentence:

However, it’s also a chance for players to discover frightening new surprises in an area they may have once considered fully explored.

is just too much for me to cope with! The Mirkwood quests are still my favourites after all this time, and the ones I return to most often. Producing extra cards would just be a xmas dream come true lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif] Seriously, I am very excited. I just hope it's not going to be a POD thing, as they would (presumably) need to be shuffled into the main encounter deck. For those of us who remain sleeveless, this could be an issue…

And now, if you'll excuse me, I shall go have a lie down…

New encounter cards for older quests huh? I like that idea. I wonder if it's going to be new cards for a specific quest or these cards are general in their use and can be used for any encounter deck. Either way, deck building encounter decks sounds awesome. :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]
