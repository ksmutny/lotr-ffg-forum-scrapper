Hi folks,

 

playing the epic mode at the following fellowship event the question came up, if each group of players at one Stage has its own victory display or do they share one for all groups.

 

Does anyone have experience from GenCon and can answer the question?

The rules imply multiple victory displays -- I believe this to be independent of what stage the groups are on:



> Q. What does it mean for a card to be "in a victory display"?
> 
> A. A card is in a victory display if it is in the victory display of any team in your group.

K.... but this reference explains a text on one of the cards.

I'm looking for a hint if every team has its own victory display.

It seems so. If i take the spelling out of the answer.
