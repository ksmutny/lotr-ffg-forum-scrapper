Some questions I had. What happens when your hero dies?

Do you still get resources for that hero? Can you spend the resources he had? Where does he go: Discard pile?

Â 

Thank you for your help. I am working through the 2nd quest in the core set.

He goes to the discard pile but can never leave there except by direct card effect: Fortune or Fate, primarily. Otherwise, they're permanently discarded. Also you discard all resources they had, plus any attachments to that hero, and they stop collecting resources for the remainder of the game.
