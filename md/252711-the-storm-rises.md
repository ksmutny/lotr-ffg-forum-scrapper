Hoo boy, not being able to remove damage from locations on NM Raid stage 2? Nightmare indeed. Well played, Mr. Newman. Well played.

Is this Matt's work?  I thought he was Arkham Horror LCG 24/7 now.

Yay! Nightmare decks for my favorite cycle! This is going to be great.

Maybe someone's more plugged into the current situation, but the article itself was written by him, so presumably he's responsible for this set, at least.

Ah didn't see that.  Nice catch guys.

I was under the impression he was still doing Nightmare decks for LotR in addition to Arkham, though I can't recall specifically where I got that impression.
