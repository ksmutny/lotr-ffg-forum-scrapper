If player one attacks an enemy with say, Eomer alone, and then the second player attacks that same enemy with Legolas in a separate attack, does the enemies defense get recounted?

Yes so it is much more effective to declare them in an attack together.

I thought so, just all this talk with Haldir and Eomer + Firefoot attacking alone has me confused, lol. Thanks!

Characters belonging to two different players can't attack together...  right?

If one has ranged they can

I think you mean that both players can attack the same enemy if the non-defending player has ranged attackers, but player 1's attackers would not be able to attack the common foe/same enemy at the same time as player 2's (ranged) attackers. Player 1 would declare and resolve his attacks, and then on player 2's turn, player 2 would declare and resolve his ranged attacks against player 1's enemies… so they would not be "attacking together" (as JasonRed3) asked, unless a card effect allowed them to do so… correct?

Ranged allow you to declare attack with enemies engaged with other player AND participate in attack declared by other player against their engaged enemies.

But when you declare a ranged attack with enemies engaged with other player, that other player cannot participate in your attack.

Exactly this. So long as the ranged character does not belong to the player declaring attacks it can participate in that players attacks with his/her characters. So as long as the character controlling Eomer is the one declaring attacks, the other player who controls legolas can declare him as an attacker against the same enemy as Eomer as a participant in that attack.

You are correct however during player 1's declaring of attackers player 2 CAN add any ranged characters to those attacks (they will then obviously not be able to declare attacks during player 2's turn to declare attacks unless they are readied somehow).

Argh! You're right! I misread the "ranged" keyword rules in the core rulebook by only allowing the ranged player to attack on his own turn… but that means I only made it harder for us to beat certain enemies and quests, not easier, so I don't feel bad.
