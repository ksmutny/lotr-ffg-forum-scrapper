Looks like the text is somethign similar to:


Setup: attack to a warrior hero or Aragorn. Restricted

Attached character gets +1W, +1A and +1D

Action: After an attack in which the attached
character participates, exhaust anduril to target
the enemy just attacked. Declare attached hero
as an attacker against that enemy (and resolve the attack)

I would have preferred it if the card was attach to Aragorn only. More then most items, the lore dictates that only Aragorn can wield it.

"Death shall come to any man that draws Elendil's sword save Elendil's heir."

I hope we get player card versions of all the famous swords - Sting, Glamdring, etc - in due time.
