When a character defends an attack, is he/she engaged with that enemy until that enemy is killed or just for that round?

Can i use a different defender for the same enemy each round?

 I am a noob, but from my understanding - you are engaged with that enemy until he's dead, but you can declare a different defender each round.

when you say "you" you mean me as a player, not the character i am using to defend?

 Yes. You as a player.

Enemies alway engage the player, not single characters.

They stay engaged with you until they are killed. There are already some exceptions to that but most of the time they stag engaged.

You can decide every turn which one of your characters will defend and which will attack. So YES.
