If Green Hill Country is my active location all characters get +1 Willpower for hide test or I get +1 at total?

If i reveal Black Feathered Arrows and I advance to the next stage,I shouldn't add the archery,right?

1) All characters.

2) Yes, since the card does say the archery is added to the total "at this stage" I think you're right.
