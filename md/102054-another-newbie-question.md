Theodred is Caught in a Web. He is already exhausted. He currently has 2 resources. I play Ally - Minor of the Iron Hills to remove the condition attachment, can I ready Theodred, or do I have to wait for the next refresh phase?

Love this game, I'm just trying to iron (heh - iron) out what for me are tough questions. The timing gets confusing.

Thanx again for your help.

You have to wait for the refresh phase.  Characters ready at the end of the round (refresh phase is the last phase of the round).  Allies are played at the beginning of the round (planning phase is the second phase of the round).  So when you play the Miner, the chance to ready to Theodred has already passed and won't come again until the end of the round.
