hi, when starting a quest the setup says to reveal 1 card from the encounter deck and add it to the staging area. per player. my question is- what if the card i reveal was a treachery card? i.e. cant be added to staging area. Â do i shuffle and replace until i draw a enemy or location? or do i do what the treachery card says instead. thanks.

Treachery cards have an effect on the game and are then discarded.. sometimes they stay on the board, as is the case with a condition you attach to one of your heroes.
