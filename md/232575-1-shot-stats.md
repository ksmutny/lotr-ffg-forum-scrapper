The first number is your attack, the second number is how many enemies have exactly that much hit points + defense, followed by the full list of enemies that fit in that category.

 

Nightmare is not included here, nor are enemies with "X" hit points or defense.

Now, after taking into account the quantity of each enemy that show up in the quests, here are the stats again:
  0:  0
 1:  6
 2:  41
 3:  92
 4:  136
 5:  126
 6:  162
 7:  67
 8:  87
 9:  56
 10:  28
 11:  21
 12:  30
 13:  16
 14:  6
 15:  2
 16:  9
 17:  3
 18:  0
 19:  0
 20:  1
 21:  1
 22:  0
 23:  0
 24:  1
 25:  1
 26:  0
 27:  3
 28:  4
 29:  4
 30:  1
 31:  0
 32:  0
 33:  0
 34:  1
 
Finally, we want to know the total enemies you can 1-shot with a given attack, so we need to sum up all the quantities from 0 up to the attack value.
 0:  0 (0.0%)
 1:  6 (0.7%)
 2:  47 (5.2%)
 3:  139 (15.4%)
 4:  275 (30.4%)
 5:  401 (44.3%)
 6:  563 (62.2%)
 7:  630 (69.6%)
 8:  717 (79.2%)
 9:  773 (85.4%)
 10:  801 (88.5%)
 11:  822 (90.8%)
 12:  852 (94.1%)
 13:  868 (95.9%)
 14:  874 (96.6%)
 15:  876 (96.8%)
 16:  885 (97.8%)
 17:  888 (98.1%)
 18:  888 (98.1%)
 19:  888 (98.1%)
 20:  889 (98.2%)
 21:  890 (98.3%)
 22:  890 (98.3%)
 23:  890 (98.3%)
 24:  891 (98.5%)
 25:  892 (98.6%)
 26:  892 (98.6%)
 27:  895 (98.9%)
 28:  899 (99.3%)
 29:  903 (99.8%)
 30:  904 (99.9%)
 31:  904 (99.9%)
 32:  904 (99.9%)
 33:  904 (99.9%)
 34:  905 (100.0%)
 
So for example, with an attack value of 5, you can 1-shot 417 enemies, or about 46.1% of the enemies you will see come up in the game.

Haha, I automated it. Took about 30 min.

Nice. Can we see some data visualisation/charts?

Thanks for the list, but for one-shot calculations "toughness" should be added as well.

 

From 3 to 6 attack the percentage jumps by about 15% for each additional point of attack, at which point diminishing returns kick in.

For a breakdown by quest (through April), I took a look at the attack needed by quest to kill at least 50% or 75% of the enemies in a particular quest's encounter deck here:

I have just finished a game with Dúnhere, having not played him in about two years maybe (though he had been my favourite of the good'ol core set days). He mostly attacked for 5 with 1 weapon (Spear of Blade) and Warhorse for a double attack. It felt ideal to equip him with a single weapon and keep the second restricted spot for the horse, as I still had ways (Unseen Strike, Charge of the Rohirrim) to boost his attack when needed. And of course, you can attach a different restricted attachment later and drop a previous one -- even change Blade for Spear (or vice versa) may sometimes be beneficial.

 

All that said, this exact statistic seems very appropriate for the given moment. Nice!

And this. It is amazing how valuable can that one point of direct damage done by Argalad be. I find him ways better than Thalin, obviously, as he can also double-duty on quest and ability with any sort of action advantage (Naith Guide seems fit for him).

We could if it was possible to copy/paste an Excel graphic into FFG forums. It doesn't seem we can, however, so nope.

Good point. I updated it to consider toughness.
