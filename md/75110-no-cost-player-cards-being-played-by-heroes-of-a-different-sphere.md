Something I've never been sure about so I've just avoided in the past, but can player cards with no cost be played by a hero with a non-corresponding sphere? The rule book seems somewhat disambiguous about it. 

For example, can Foe-Hammer or Blood of Numenor be used in decks that don't run a respective tactics or spirit hero? (Songs not withstanding)

Better than that, its in the rulebook, page 12.

 

"Cards with a cost of zero do not require a resource to be 
spent in order to pay their cost, but they do require 
at least one hero under that player’s control to have a 
resource icon that matches the card’s sphere."

Hi Guys. Similar question.

When playing Escape from Dol Goldur, if the hero captured is the only hero with that sphere of influence, can you still play 0 cost cards from your hand that matches that influence?

As the hero doesn't collect resources it is the only cards from that sphere that I can play.

However, technically that hero is not considered in play, therefore does that remove him from my control and ultimately the cardsof that sphere that I can play?

Thanks in advance.

No, you can't play cards with the sphere of influence of the only hero who is captured in Escape from Dol Goldur
