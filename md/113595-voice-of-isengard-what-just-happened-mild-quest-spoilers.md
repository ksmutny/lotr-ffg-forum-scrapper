# [Voice of Isengard - what just happened? (Mild quest spoilers)](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/113595-voice-of-isengard-what-just-happened-mild-quest-spoilers/)

I'm questioning the set difficulty levels for this expansion.

Fords of Isen was a medium scenario for my deck. To Catch an Orc... god, I don't think I've ever struggled so hard with a scenario. I was positively swarmed by enemies every turn and there was no way I could both quest and defend all attacks, much less retaliate. To Catch an Orc is DL 4. I tried and failed countless times, and yesterday when I finally beat it I deliberately ignored card effects on the third stage. There was no way I was going to capture Mugash again.

I just tried Into Fangorn for the first time, having about 15 minutes to spare as I'm going to a party later today. It's rated at DL 6. I just breezed through it in those 15 minutes - the Huorn mechanic was no match at all for my questing power, and I captured Mugash in the third round and never lost him. Didn't lose a single ally.

Did the third scenario just favour a questing deck like mine? What are your experiences with these scenarios?

I'm a bit behind the release order, but I've been stuck on TCaO for quite some time and haven't wanted to start the Ring-maker cycle without "beating" VoI.

I've beaten To Catch an Orc with my first try. Solo. Either an extremely good luck on my side, or an extremely bad one on yours.

Fords Isern and Catch an Orc are pretty well designed to me. However, Into Fangron i don't like. But i think it is good designed also. I only say that i don't like, but the thematic is good: you must run to go into Fangorn, catch Mugash, and go out fastly before getting angry the huorns. It is good idea, but i don't like to run, only tu run all you can.

If considering quests only, not player cards, I think Voice of Isengard is the worst big box expansion to date.  The first quest was pretty good.  Wasn't too hard or too easy.  I think it captures a fierce battle even better than Cair Andros, Assualt on Osgiliath, Seventh Level and others.   The second quest I don't like because of one reason.  Only way to find mugash is  revealing locations.  It seems I don't draw locations often enough when I play To catch an Orc.  The locations always go as shadow cards!  I had a game where I went through the WHOLE encounter deck and half of the next one and I only drew I location besides the starting one.  And I still hadn't found Mugash.  It ended up taking 23 rounds....... other times I play that quest it still takes around 13-20 rounds.  Very annoying.  To Catch an Orc is one of those "Redhorn Gate" quests where it's a cool quest, but it has "finding" mechanics involved in it and that is not good.  As for the third quest, I've only played it twice.  I was using Flight to the Ford deck which can handle incredible amounts threat increase so I just always took the threat increasing huorns and I was pretty good.  If you don't have spirit when playing that quest, I think you could be in trouble and have a tough time, but I was able to keep threat low and cancel a few nasty treachery and shadow effects which was key.  I know Tracker1 loves To Catch an Orc.  I'm not sure why.  I wonder what deck he uses.  But I don't think it's such a great quest.

To catch an Orc gets really hard with four players. You simply cannot remove time counters as 8 cards revealed with many surges makes you die and reveal as many in subsequent rounds.

I dont remember so much if Catch an Orc is harder in 4 players. I think Fords of Isern is really hard in 4 players. (Sure: Druadan Forest ^^)

I play (or tried playing) the VoI quests both solo and two-player and I felt exaclty the same way. With my solo deck I was not able to beat to Catch an Orc and I barely made it in a two player game using a heavy-questing a high-power attack deck. Into Fangorn was like a stroll on a sunny sunday morning in comparison.

So pretty much felt the same like OP and am really surprised to see that not everybody is of the same opinion...makes me love this game even more, because it shows once again that there are so many different decks and playstyles to discover and try out. I am still missing some expansions and have only one core set...so I am stil somewhat limited in my deck-construction possiblities.

I like Ford Of Isen is quite cool and very difficult with 4 players but.....there is one but: you Include Eowyn and she will take care most of the problem!

 

Catch an Orc is a good quest il love it! IS only flaws is when you play solo and Mugash come early you lost. There is no way to o something if He come early since he is really strong and Felowship is don't . 

 

Last quest is big Disappoint for me.... Hourns  looks cool, new mechanic too but practically is really boring and easy! Nmode probable change it to good!

And yes i agree with Khamul. VOL probably is a worst Deluxe for now
