So what do you think....when will see an ally (or hero!?) version of Galadriel? She is one of my favourite characters and I was clearly hoping that she will appear in the new deluxe expansion / cycle...however, I cannot really see her fit in...?

## 2 [Nickpes on August 28, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89385-galadriel/?do=findComment&comment=852357)

IMO there is a problem with Galadriel ... she should be more powerfull than Gandalf, Saruman or Elrond ... and thats very difficult to happen without having a hero with a huge threat or an ally with a huge cost. 

 

Also her stats are another prob the way I think of it, when Eowyn quests by 4 ... Galadriel should be more, shouldn't she ? And there are many more 

 

 

I too hope we get her, but I find it to be difficult 

## 3 [faith_star83 on August 28, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89385-galadriel/?do=findComment&comment=852374)

hmm...I see you regard this issue from a more technical perspective and raise very valid points. On a side note, imho Eowyn is just to strong I was looking at her just yesterday! 4 Willpower with the potential to raise it by X (where X is number of players) is just too much? As you say, Galadriel had to have super-super-stats to give justice to her power in the setting... Ah, maybe, I won't get to behold her after all then... ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

I think there are many good ways to represent her well as a Hero.  One idea I came up with:

 

Sphere: Spirit

 

Threat: 10

Will: 0

Attack: 1

Defense: 3

HP: 4

 

Noldor.  Noble.

 

Refresh Action:  Pay 1 resource from Galadriel's resource pool to Choose a player.  Until the end of the round, reduce that player's threat by 10 for the purpose of engagement checks.

 

She may be powerful, but she's not outwardly active anymore.  Questing is not really her thing.  Nor is attack.  Her main purpose is protection - for herself and others.  Another idea:

 

Action:  Exhaust Galadriel to shuffle the encounter deck.

> On a side note, imho Eowyn is just to strong I was looking at her just yesterday! 4 Willpower with the potential to raise it by X (where X is number of players) is just too much?

i do not think eowyn is strong. good yes, strong...not as much as others. she can quest for 4, and at the very most, 8. however, get longbeard map maker and steward of gondor on a lore hero, mixed with a couple of other lore heroes...and he alone can easily quest with 15+ willpower per turn, without much set up really.

 

aragorn with the sword that was broken adds +1 willpower per character controlled by that player...i mean get that in outlands (which can quest 20+ willpower alone often) and you are getting into ridiculous territory.

 

as for galadriel i think we shall certainly see her. she is powerful but there are many ways to portray power. gandalf has a huge quick boost to the game, which can be game changing, but he needs to be used strategically. glorfindel is a solid hero all round and is a constant power, elrond is power at a high cost

 

galadriel i think will also be power at a high cost. i do not think we shall see her until the second saga pack....which isnt really that long, but we may be surprised if the rohan cycle looks to have lorien as a side theme

I agree with rich here Nick. I don't think the power is a problem as much as the ability to properly represent it. 

 

They divided Elrond from his ring and a portion of his power. Why wouldn't they do the same to Galadriel? 

 

But I have to ask. Why do you think Lady Galadriel should be more powerful than Elrond?

> But I have to ask. Why do you think Lady Galadriel should be more powerful than Elrond?

 

I'd guess because she is older, from the Years of the Trees, she's one of the Calaquendi (High Elves, Tareldar), had seen/lived in Valinor, and my favorite reason, though perhaps least valid, she's his Mother-in-law.

## 8 [Pharmboys2013 on August 28, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89385-galadriel/?do=findComment&comment=852687)

Really looking forward to an eventual Galadriel character.  Also based on her illustrations of "the favor of the lady" and "galadrim's greeting" I hope Magali is the artist for her as well.  Power wise I'm thinking she'll be similar to Elrond with strong stats, passive abilities, and then an associated Nenya attachment that gives a more direct ability

## 9 [Rainelotr on August 29, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89385-galadriel/?do=findComment&comment=852945)

Man it has been at least 10 years since I read these books but I never got the feeling that being older qualifies you as more powerful. Furthermore Galadriel's power was tied up in Lorien somewhat like Tom Bombadil though she was certainly far more interested in what happened outside her borders than he. Besides what is power without action? Saruman was long the 'oldest' and 'wisest' of the wizarding order and look where that got him.

igoing back to the why this is all relevant, if they made elrond then I don't see why galadriel wouldn't be a possibility.

## 10 [kyrie on August 29, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89385-galadriel/?do=findComment&comment=852997)

Here's how I would design the Lady Galadriel:

 

SPIRIT

Threat: 13

WP: 4

AT:  2

DF:  3

HP: 4

 

Response: After Galadriel exhausts to commit to a quest, each player lowers his threat by 1.

 

Action: Exhaust Galadriel and raise your threat by 1 to choose a player. That player looks at the top 5 cards of his deck and chooses 1 to put into his hand, shuffling the other cards back into his deck.

 

 

The thought here was that she should be an excellent quester, exceeding even Eowyn in that she has potential to reduce each player's threat every time she quests (which she should be doing). But she is a great defender as well at 3 DF. Attack is not bad either. She of course has a high threat, but through questing you can reduce it significantly.

 

I wanted to give her a second ability that highlights her power to look into the future (think Galadriel's mirror scene with Frodo) and bring great benefit to the whole team. So you can hold her back from questing (or unexpected courage her) to exhaust her and raise your threat by 1 for a powerful drawing capability that has an Imladris Stargazer/Master of the Forge flavor to it. In some ways this drawing power exceeds even Beravor's because you can pick the best one out of 5. But you only get one and you have to raise your threat so I don't think it makes Beravor obsolete.

 

Anyways, I am hoping we see her soon and that she is a power-house that rivals Glorfindel and Elrond.

I like this "version" of Galadriel a lot. For me, somehow, a deck manipulating ability als almost an auto-include when it comes to Galadriel, since she is able to look into the future and just knows or has a fair clue what might wait around the next corner.

 

Probably it also makes sense to anticipate her with a ring like it was the case with Elrond!

 

Anyway, at the moment she is probably my most aniticpated character in the game and I really wonder whether we will see her even in this cycle already! :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Her response or action you have suggested could be tied to her ring (Nenya?), the same way as Elrond's Vilya.

Galadriel

SPIRIT

Threat: 13

WP: 4

AT: 2

DF: 3

HP: 3

Action: Exhaust Galadriel to ready 2 other heroes (limit once per round)

Nenya, ring of water

Type: Attachment Sphere: Neutral

Cost: 2

Ring. Artifact.

Attach to Galadriel. She gains a [Lore] resource icon.

Action: Exhaust Galadriel and Nenya to choose a player(limit once per game), reduce that players threat by 10.

Resonse: After a character is declared as a defender, Exhaust Nenya to give that character a +2 [Defense] until the end of the phase.

Well, galadriel is a figure not so much involved in the main histories, but the myth following her justifies her being maybe the strongest living person in middle earth third age.

Tolkien himself thought her and gilgalad to be the mightiest of elves. She was famous for wisdom and her magic abilities tought maybe by melian, a maia. She destroyed dol guldur through magic once. Offcourse her age could add to her wisdom.

Thats why i believe her to be even stronger than Elrond (whom i admit i prefer as a character than the lady)

## 18 [richsabre on August 29, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89385-galadriel/?do=findComment&comment=853559)

and she also led the elves across the icy wastes of wherever that was in the silmarillion.....i cannot remember as i am terrible when it comes to 1st age lore

## 19 [Rainelotr on August 29, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89385-galadriel/?do=findComment&comment=853577)

You know I made the atrocious mistake of reading half of the silmarillion and then pausing for a month before continuing. Totally ruined the book for me. I wasn't willing to start over because it's not nearly as readable or enjoyable imho as the trilogy and especially not as enjoyable as the Hobbit. Furthermore, pausing that long in the middle of a book with names that foreign and random and of that number just ... confused.... me.... so..... much. I was also like 15 so that was also probably a problem.

 

Anyway, thanks for the explanation Nick, rich. If I had to stat her after that explanation I wouldn't give her more than 1 atk... 0 maybe even. def... that would be iffy too. 2 def sounds good to me, though I would hardly argue with 3. Channel all that magic and wisdom straight into Willpower and represent her abilities through unique effects just like Elrond. Frankly I will be SUPER excited to see any high threat Spirit character and I think Lady Galadriel is the best candidate so far for that honorable placement.

Blah .... I wrote a post, thought i posted but apparently not ... Again then ....

As far as Galadriel goes, she also is credited to test herself against the temptation of the one ring, being able to resist. Her ring, One of the three given to elves, was about the defense and preservation of her realm. She was of the chief elves when they left for middle earth in FA, though her party did not take part in kinslaying. And since most of her features are in sillmarilion, i might forget things though it is the one i love most.

Glorfindel where indeed two different elves, whom story at some point was added together to make one. I cant remember more cause i just woke up cause my son fell off bed at two in the morning, thus my mind is sleeping, as i will be doing so soon hehe

Maybe her ring could do some kind of character defense boost.

## 29 [Nickpes on August 30, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89385-galadriel/?do=findComment&comment=853902)

Imo she could be lke

Threat 14 ( it may seem big, but will explain later)

Willpower 5 (but with an effect that could raise it)

Attack 1 (not a combat fighter)

Defense 2

Hit points 3

Exhaust galadriel to choose a location. Place 2 progress tolkens ( this goes in my mind cause of her deep knowledge on middle earth, dwelling there more years than anyone, also since her magic allowed her to destroy dol guldur, she had power to overcome obstacles)

And the there would be Nenya(her ring) on a cost of two with text

Attach to Galadriel.

Exhaust nenya and galadriel to chose on of the two options

-Raise a characters defence by 2 , after the charcter defense, ready him.

-chose a character, heal 3 HP on him (she had great heal powers and i think it had to do with the ring)

We have the mirror, cost 3 maybe

Attach to Galadriel

Exhaust mirror and galadriel to chose one

-look the to 5 cards of your deck. Play one for no cost (if it has the same sphaire as galadriel) and return the other by any order on top of your deck

-look the top 5 cards of encounter deck and return them in any order.

Now, thats why the threat at 14, cause her abilities when used with her items give players huge advantages. Galadriel cannot have raised stats for att and def, this was not he case... Her abilities were knowledge, and of magic.

Maybe my thought is all wrong, never again tried to think of a player card, so forgive that it may be a total stupidity since there might be game aspects i do not take in consideration, but thats what i came as a thought.

I forgot her bond with Gandalf, it was very strong with mutual respect. Thus there should be something on her card like

"When playing Gandalf pay one less resource"

Or

"Exhaust Galadriel to ready Gandalf"

I do like the thought, Nick. It is very nice thematic-wise, but from a game-mechanic point of view this ability will be way too limited, as you only get to use it when Gandalf is in play (which he almost never is, since only quickly visits). Plus, you always needed to include both in the same deck to make ultimate use of them.

 

Actually, what I think would really cool is seeing the mirror as an encounter objective in an upcoming LotR Saga Expansion,

where the hero's get a chance to glimpse into the future.

 

Less cool, but nice to have would be a spirit event, where you could get some Gildor-like card-scrying/draw effect. I think Gildor's ability is my very favourite so far anyway :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

## 32 [Nickpes on August 30, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89385-galadriel/?do=findComment&comment=853966)

the mirror would be nice I agree to use by anyone, but Galadriel had it, it was not something around middle earth, so she should be connected with it someway 

 

PS : I also love Gildors ability and Gildor in general, especially in the books,, but Imladriz stargazer with Elrond and Vilya are even better IMO.

Actually No.  Galadriel is NOT more powerful than the Istari, who are of the Maiar, who were present at the Music of Ainur, before the creation of world, let alone the Elves.

 

Galadriel is the most powerful and eldest Elf in Middle-earth at the time though.  And it could be argued she is one of the greatest of the Noldor, second only to Feanor who is long dead by the hands of the Balrog, Gothmog during the First Age.  She, like Melian the Maia, effectively kept Lothlorien on locked down from agents of Sauron.  She learned from the Valar themselves, the great powers of the world, having been born in the Undying Lands prior to the First Age.

I would like it better if she would be a 'force', rather than a character. Or a utility character  that can't attack, quest or block, but has regenerative/protective powers for other characters. Some thing like this:

 

Lore
Threat: 7
WP: 0
AT: 0
DF: 2
HP: 5

 

Galadriel cannot attack, quest or block.

Action: exhaust galadriel to lower a player's threat by three. Can only be used on a player with a threat of 35 or higher.

Response: when a response or card is played that heals a character, lower its cost by 1

 

Something like that. It doesn;t really seems right to have galadriel walk about in middle earth. She stays in lothorien, but evenso has considerable influence.

## 38 [asfaloth on September 14, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89385-galadriel/?do=findComment&comment=866365)

There's no reason to think of Galadriel as more powerful than Gandalf, for the wizard is an Istari, one of the Ainur, and therefore a greater spiritual entity than an elf. 

 

Of course Galadriel was one of the most powerful elves in Middle Earth along with Elrond and Glorfindel. Galadriel had seen very ages, lived amongst the Valar and learnt from them. Elrond had a kind of lore alike but he was much younger and he had not seen Valinor.

 

Glorfindel was different. Presumably he was the most powerful elf during the Third Age but specially in combat and facing the evil forces. After his death in Gondolin, he was returned to life by the Valar in Valinor. They made him more powerful, almost as a Maiar, and sent him back to Middle Earth to fight against Sauron and to give strength to Gil Galad and Elrond. He would be like an angel or saint amongst the elves: purged from his sins and renewed. He was the only thing that the Witch King feared. Indeed he was supposed to be the captain of the elves in the last fight against the shadow in case of a failure of the fellowship of the ring. That's the reason why he didn't join the fellowship.

I'm not sure about stats and i agree that she would have a high threat cost... ability wise:

 

how about something like the following:

 

(Maybe time x) Exhaust Galadriel to look at x encounter cards, put back on top of the deck in any order you choose. (no other player cards, actions or abilities can be played on the encounter deck for the rest of phase or perhaps round). To stop it being abused with the likes of Palantar).

 

Once per game: Exhaust Galadriel to move all engaged enemies back to the staging area and for time x no engagement checks or attacks can be made. Heal up to 1 damage on all characters... (re the respite that fellowship had in Lorien).

I think she should be an ally similar to Gandalf.

 

She should have some powerful threat reduction ability

or
It would be cool if there were some way she could give you a short "break" from the game where your threat didn't go up and you didn't have to engage any enemies but they still piled up in the staging area until you were ready to get back on the road (to represent the theme of the Fellowship resting in Lorien). Maybe that would be better if there were a player 'location' card for Lothlorien.

Lore Ally

Cost: 4

Will Power: 3

Attack: 0

Defense: 1

HP: 2

 

Galadriel can not commit to the quest and is discarded if her Will power is ever 0. 

 

Quest Action: Raise your threat by X to reduce Galadriel's Will Power by X (til end of the Round) to peek at the top X cards of the encounter deck. Move any treachery cards to the discard pile and put the rest back on top on the encounter deck in any order.

I think besides willpower (representing her magic and wisdom) her physical stats should be low. But using her magic power she should be potentially awesome in everything...

Galadriel, Spirit Hero

Threat Cost: 10

Willpower: 4

Attack: 1

Defense: 1

Hit Points: 3

At the start of the round Galadriel may exchange her Attack or Defense value with her Willpower value until the end of the round

Action: Exhaust Galadriel to reduce target players threat by 3

Ooo! I like that idea, Legolas. Although I'd probably lower it to "Lower by 2 threat."

Lore treachery cancellation, I like it. And it fits really well with Galadriel's powers. Perhaps slightly more tasty:

 

Galadriel - Lore - Ally

 

5 cost / 2 willpower / 1 attack / 2 defense / 4 hit points

 

"Quest Action: after Galadriel has committed to the quest, and before encounter cards are revealed, reduce Galadriel's Willpower by X to look at the top X cards of the encounter deck. Discard one Treachery card of your choice and return any remaining cards to the top of the encounter deck in any order."

 

Fits in with Lore's scrying theme, provides Treachery cancellation and gives you a choice of questing with her Willpower or not. I have increased her cost and reduced her base willpower to 2 because I think it might otherwise  become too powerful, but this would still allow some shenanigans through Faramir, Elrond's Counsel or Children of the Sea if you wanted to develop this into a major deck theme.

 

Ever since the appearance of Denethor and his ability in the core set I have regarded questing as a fairly fluid concept where not necessarily every character providing willpower to the quest is actually running through a forest. So I would not mind having Galadriel as an active quester, but I can see where other people may have a different opinion.

I have been pondering about Nenya (Galacdriels ring). While I have several ideas, this version seems to be the most fitting in my opinion:

Nenya, Ring, Artifact

Cost 2 (Neutral)

Attach to Galadriel. She gains a lore resource icon.

Action: Exhaust Galadriel and Nenya to cancel the "when revealed" effects of a card that was just revealed from the encounter deck.

We have been waiting for this strong effect to pop up again since the core set and to me it seems to be about time. To Galadriel/Nenya this action seems to be very fitting. It's the best, most wanted and rarest defensive ability I can think of.

## 46 [Olorin93 on September 18, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89385-galadriel/?do=findComment&comment=869114)

Agreed, treachery cancellation would be most welcome.

## 47 [richsabre on September 18, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89385-galadriel/?do=findComment&comment=869124)

the designers would have to be really careful on that effect. most quests in this game pretty much are based around treachery cards.

 

enemies and locations are fine, but its the treacheries that kill more often than not (and often through manipulating enemies and locations)

 

so she would have to have some good stats to make exhausting her quite a poor trade off. it is nice though

I agree. It would be a very usefull, strong and unique effect. Bejond game mechanics what I like best about it is that it seems so incredibly fitting for Galadriel! And it really should be strong and unique. Like Elrond with Vilya. Besides I think getting a free card and being able to play it for free would still be the stronger effect!?

## 49 [jormungandr on September 23, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89385-galadriel/?do=findComment&comment=873394)

really?  I think the ability ClydeCloggie thought of is way stronger. Manipulating the quest deck is very powerful. Then again, I'm a solo player. I might not be the case in multi.
