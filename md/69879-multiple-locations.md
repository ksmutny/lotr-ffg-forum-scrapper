in laketown there is a location that after you exhaust an hero you can travel to it and have to active locationsâ€¦.theres no rules been said about this on the insert, so how does this work.? can you chose where the progress goes?

thanks

If there's no description in the insert, I'd certainly rule that you can choose where to place progress tokens from questing. I would expect you'd have to place each "batch" of tokens on one or the other (i.e., if you generate two progress, you pick one active location and place both tokens on that card instead of placing one progress on two separate locations). Once you fully explore one, additional tokens should carry over to the other active location.

That's all really conjecture, though. There's no extant rules text governing multiple active locations, so I'm just guessing here.
