# [The WORST Hero](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/226636-the-worst-hero/)

## 1 [987654321 on August 4, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/226636-the-worst-hero/?do=findComment&comment=2342317)

Exactly the same as Thanatopsis's Hero Championship except you choose the hero you dislike the most(following any criteria). Everybody gets in except Baggins, Fellowhsip and unreleased heroes(I will consider TFotW to be unreleased here). Let the game begin!

ROUND 0

These are the best heroes from the 2015 championship. They will battle themselves in a competition for who's the most disliked so that we can get in a square of 2 number!

A:Galadriel-Legolas

B:Frodo Baggins-Haldir of Lórien

C:Lore Aragorn-Spirit Merry

D:Beregond-Tactics Boromir

E:Elrond-Tactics Aragorn

F:Gandalf-Spirit Théoden

G:Éowyn-Sam Gamgee

H:Arwen Undómiel-Éomer

This is more of a WORST of the BEST list, instead of just the absolute WORST, but I'm game for anything that distracts me from working so...

 

A: Legolas - I like his ally version more
B: Frodo Baggins - unlike several around here, I hate him.  plain and simple.
C: Spirit Merry - while extremely useful, is just boring threat reduction
D: Tactics Boromir - only because I haven't actually used him yet and can't turn my back on Beregond, who has saved me in many MANY games.
E: Tactics Aragorn - how often are there really THAT many things to kill?
F: Spirit Théoden - Santa art can suck it.  Galdalf is the best.
G: Éowyn - just like Merry, extremely useful and used often, but just boring high powered questing.
H: Arwen Undómiel - this was the hardest to answer for me, but Eomer is just more fun to use.

 

 

Yea, seems most of my answers are on the fun scale instead of power levels.

 

I decided to look through all the heroes and with 73 heroes, I'm impressed to say there are only 4 that I think are really terrible and pretty much unplayable and could be on the WORST of the WORST list:

Bombur, Fatty Bolger, Glorfindel (L) and Pippin (S).   

 

Sure Bombur and Pippin could be fit into the "right deck", but I'd argue those decks are likely bad anyways.

A.  Legolas, because I love Galadriel.

B.  Frodo, because Haldir is more fun.

C.  Lore Aragorn, because I like lots of little threat decreases over one big one.

D.  Beregond, because he's so lame compared to his spirit version :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

E.  Tactics Aragorn, because Elrond is more versatile

F.   Gandalf, because Spirit Theoden is awesome (and can use Gandalf allies)

G.  Eowyn, because she's so lame compared to her tactics version :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

H.  Eomer, because I love Arwen.

## 4 [Crabble on August 4, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/226636-the-worst-hero/?do=findComment&comment=2342699)

So there will be another poll after this where we decide between the other heroes and the last 2 in this first poll who the worst hero in this game is?

 

Anyway to this poll:

 

A:Galadriel

Legolas just kicks ass and is still one of the best heroes in this game!
B:Frodo Baggins

Frodo was fun against the Balrog but I have not used him in years for any deck
C:Lore Aragorn

Hard one but Loragorn is just boring to play
D:Tactics Boromir

Sorry Brandon but Beregond is just better ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]
E:Elrond

I love my Dunedaindeck so Elrond has to be named here
F:Gandalf

I just don't like the OP hero Gandalf. Yes if you badly want to win against a scenario use him but otherwise use some more fun heroes
G:Sam Gamgee

Down with the hobbit!
H:Arwen Undómiel

Easy choice, Eomer is soooo much more fun to play

> So there will be another poll after this where we decide between the other heroes and the last 2 in this first poll who the worst hero in this game is?

Nope. This is to have 64 left. Then, we keep comparing them to each other until only the worst is left.

A:Galadriel-Recently, I played Journey Down the Anduin where I used Lego to keep recycling the Banks of Anduin. Ididn't get any other location until stage 3. It was so fun!

B:Frodo Baggins-Haldir just kicks asses(and he was in Helm's Deep! okay not, but you can consider it an alternative story).

C:Merry-Aragorn has fun combos while Merry simply aimes to destroy threat.

D:Beregond-I believe action advantage is better than a wall.

E:Aragorn-Sorry guys, but Elrond has Vilya.

F:Gandalf-He has 14 threat and isn't actually that powerful without his toys.

G:Éowyn:Éowyn is Éowyn, but Sam is Sam.

H:Arwen Undómiel:Arwen has a W, and it's Wednesday, which is a perfectly valid criteria.

## 7 [Glowwyrm on August 5, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/226636-the-worst-hero/?do=findComment&comment=2343657)

Reverse Hero Challenge!  Interesting!

A:Legolas:  Tough call, but his ally version has pushed the hero out of favor in my decks.
B:Frodo Baggins: I just like Haldir's ability a bit better.
C:Spirit Merry: Lore Aragorn still a must for Doomed decks.  Merry's great, but just a bit below.
D:Boromir: Most difficult decision of the round.  I'll pick the stalwart defender over the crazy readying force.
E:Elrond:  Just think Scorpigorn is more fun to play.
F:Spirit Théoden: Both are really good heroes, but I like the variety of decks you can build around Gandalf hero.
G:Éowyn: Sam is my favorite hero in LoTR, so this is easy.
H:Éomer: Go Noldor!

I don't expect any of these heroes to advance beyond the round of 64, because they're all really good.

## 8 [Calvadur on August 5, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/226636-the-worst-hero/?do=findComment&comment=2344168)

A:Galadriel-Legolas - The kick-ass Silvan beats the water-looking Noldor
B:Frodo Baggins-Haldir of Lórien - I like Frodo
C:Lore Aragorn-Spirit Merry - This is my favorite Aragorn 
D:Beregond-Tactics Boromir - Both gondorian powerhouses, but the noble one is just insane
E:Elrond-Tactics Aragorn  - The healing Elrond provides is just so awesome
F:Gandalf-Spirit Théoden  - Gandalf is just much more fun than Santa
G:Éowyn-Sam Gamgee - No way our 2015 Champion (iircc) loses to a quest-bot
H:Arwen Undómiel-Éomer - Even though she blocks her own incredible ally, I enjoy playing Arwen much more than Éomer        

## 9 [Fingolfin Fate on August 5, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/226636-the-worst-hero/?do=findComment&comment=2344267)

Sorry I won't play this but there is one striking thing: when Tactics Boromir first appeared, I had already glorified him but mostly because I was (and am) a huge fan of the character in the books, but there seemed very little enthusiasm for the character in the game, certainly no nearly as much as there is now. Was the potential realized largely due to Gondorian Shield, and in some decks Blood of Númenor and Gondorian Fire? I totally see the fascination with the latter two, it is obviously one way to rule them all, but I think Boromir is still amazing without them, and there are just so many things he can do, including paying exhaustion cost.

Hello all – first post here.  As penance for my entry into the forums being on such a curmudgeonly thread, I hereby promise to build a deck around whoever “wins”.

 

Here are my votes:

 

A. Legolas.  Close – love them both, but both have their drawbacks for me.  Galadriel is in so many of my decks, but if I had to criticise, lately I find her toys (Mirror, Silver Harp, optionally Nenya) a bit of a burden, both in terms of including them in the first place, then in terms of drawing and playing them.  This is true of many heroes, admittedly, including many of those that I’ve given the nod to below, but especially so of Galadriel – I think the thing is that Galadriel tends to be included as a support hero, whose attachments help you to fetch the things that you need to make your deck work, but said attachments then clutter up the deck further, which can be frustrating. 

 

As for Legolas, I still use him, but a few things count against him: the ally version tends to muscle him out lately, his ability is for the most part less vital than it used to be, and I think Haldir is actually a better target (albeit out of sphere) for most of Legolas’s usual toys (Rivendell Blade/Bow and Bow of the Galadhrim).  So I think Legolas loses out this time (although he is actually in one of my current decks, and performing admirably).

 

B. Frodo.  It actually strikes me that they’re oddly similar as “defensive” heroes: both can avoid damage, but Frodo does it at the expense of threat, and Haldir at the expense of loading him up with enough attacking prowess to kill enemies before they even strike.  Anyway, nothing against Frodo, but Haldir’s sniping is arguably more powerful in a given situation, and (more importantly) just too much fun for him to lose out.

 

C. Lore Aragorn.  Actually never really appreciated his ability too much, although admittedly I’ve never built around it to any great extent.  Anyway, I prefer Merry’s repeatable reduction, and he makes a certain type of deck (eg. Palantir) sing like a bird.

 

D. Beregond.  Tough choice, as they often compete over the same role in my decks, and are even good targets for the same attachments, but the inbuilt action advantage gives Boromir the nod. 

 

E. Elrond.  I’m a fan of Elrond, but Tactics Aragorn is possibly the most pure fun out of all the heroes.

 

F. Spirit Theoden.  Love Rohan (especially spirit Rohan), and Theoden makes a great keystone for the archetype.  Gandalf, though … some would argue that he needs his toys (actually just the staff and some readying, in my opinion) to really shine, but that’s true of many heroes, and every deck I’ve built with him has been so much fun.  

 

G. Sam Gamgee.  I like Sam, but I have to say I’ve never really gotten him to work with any real efficacy (might be worth another go, though - maybe I'll change my mind).  Eowyn sees less play than she used to, but still has her place, and Eowyn plus Snowmane/Heregrim is still crazy fun, even if the upcoming Tactics version makes that strategy slightly redundant.

 

H. Eomer.  This is a tight one.  Eomer is more fun, but if you don’t build around him then he doesn’t work very well in my opinion.  Arwen is almost the opposite – all she needs is Elven-Light to get a subtle draw/resource engine going that can really smooth the workings of a stalling deck.  She does lose marks for precluding ally Arwen, however.

A:Legolas-Tactics Merry (Legolas is just so much better then Merry. Outside of pure hobbit deck Merry is only used to get Legolas up and attack again ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] )
B:Thalin-Leadership Boromir (Both?! I haven't used Thalin in quite some time so he gets the vote here)
C:Lore Faramir-Lore Glorfindel (Again Both?! Lore Glorfindels abilty nowadays is way to costly and his spirit version disqualifies the lore version)
D:Nori-Spirit Pippin (Easy here, Spirit Pippin is just useless to me)
E:Frodo-Ori (Haven't used Frodo for quite some time so he will have to continue here)
F:Dúnhere-Halbarad (Halbarad is sooo much fun to play in a Dunedaindeck)
G:Óin-Glóin (What does Oin again? Oh right... No thanks!)
H:Elladan-Caldara (Caldara Decks just got real so easy choice here)
I:Beregond-Balin (Really?! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] )
J:Spirit Glorfindel-Lanwyn (Lanwyn got a pretty bad matchup here)
K:Dwalin-Eleanor (Again a vote for both?!)
L:Háma-Gimli (Gimli is more fun to play with)
M:Tactics Aragorn-Elrohir (Easy win for Aragorn here, Elrohir gets this vote just like his brother)
N:Thorin Oakenshield-Tactics Théoden (Tactics Théoden is just a bad hero in my opinion. The spirit version is easily better and right worded)
O:Brand Son of Bain-Gríma (Since I'm a multiplayer guy Grima is not for me)
P:Dori-Bard the Bowman (Dori is at least for me the favorite to "win" this competition)
Q:Spirit Théoden-Lore Denethor (Sorry Lore Denethor you leadership version is too good)
R:Mirlonde-Beravor (Mirlonde is no good outside Monolore while Beravor still goes strong with here carddraw even after the Errata)
S:Círdan the Shipwright-Théodred (Theodred is to old and to boring while Cirdan is sooo powerful with his ring)
T:Dain Ironfoot-Bombur (Dain is a mus in every dwarfdeck while Bombur is not)
U:Éowyn-Elfhelm (Tough one. I like Elfhelm very much so Eowyn gets the vote here but surely will win in the next round)
V:Leadership Aragorn-Bifur (Don't like the dwarf that much)
W:Mablung-Ori (Nether this one)
X:Hirluin the Fair-Idraen (Idraen got a pretty hard matchup here and unfortunately gets the vote here)
Y:Éomer-Amarthíul (None. I will not vote in this matchup! Both heroes are great and don't deserve to be on this list)
Z:Rossiel-Erkenbrand (Rossieldecks are more fun to play)
AA:Leadership Denethor-Galdor of the Havens (Leadership Denethor is just very good while Galdor is soso...)
AB:Beorn-Celeborn (I like the bear more ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] )
AC:Treebeard-Lore Pippin (Tough one again but Pippin is more splashable)
AD:Damrod-Fatty Bolger (Fatty will fight Dori and Spirit Pippin for the crown in this thread I guess ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] )
AE:Leadership Faramir-Prince Imrahil (Really really close here put Leadership Faramir seems to be a little better)

A) Legolas.  Merry is lower threat, rocks in a hobbit deck, and has a neater ability.  Plus Legolas blocks his awesome ally.

B) Thalin.  Leadership Boromir is a necessary component of Gondor decks, so I can't vote him out.

C) LoFaramir.  He blocks his awesome ally, and his ability is anti-synergestic.

D) SpPippin.  He's got the threat for a hobbit secrecy deck, but his ability raises threat and works against Sam/TaMerry

E) Frodo.  Doesn't work well with other hobbits, and while he's an indestructable defender there are plenty of good defenders who won't raise threat.  Plus Ori is great in a dwarf deck.

F) Dunhere.  Halbarad works great in a Dunedain deck

G) Oin.  Gloin is a hero you build a deck around, Oin is one of the lesser dwarf deck heroes.

H)  Elladan.  He's limited to work only with his brother, and Caldara has her own deck type.

I)  TaBeregond.  OK, he's better than Balin, but Balin is very splashable and doesn't block a better version of his hero.  SpBeregond is better than TaBeregond

J)  Lanwyn.  SpGlorfindel is just too good.

K)  Dwalin.  His ability is worthless in a good proportion of quests, while Elanor's isn't.

L)  Hama.  Very powerful, but I love Gimli.

M)  Elrohir.  Limited to work with his brother.

N)  Thorin Oakenshield.  Tough call because Thorin is awesome in a dwarf deck, but TaTheoden first made the solo tactics deck possible.  SpTheoden is better than TaTheoden, but solo tactics and Rohan don't really overlap.

O)  Brand.  This is tough for me because Brand's readying works so beautifully in two-handed with a hero that can use a post-attack action (e.g. ring holders and Beravor), but Grima is very powerful solo and has a unique effect.

P)  Bard.  This is mostly because I've been playing a whole lots of quests with Dori fellowships, since Bard can attack for effectively 5 (!) against many enemies, but Dori's ability to turn practically anyone into Beregond is more useful than you might think.  He's not actually a bad hero, and I think he'd be considered a good hero in a world without Beregond.

Q)  LoDenethor.  He's an awesome solo hero, but SpTheoden is the essential hero for Rohan decks.

R)  Mirlonde.  A 1-3 threat discount can't stand up to card-drawing ability.

S)  Theodred.  Theodred's a great leadership splash, and I think his extra resource is more generally useful than Cirdan's power.  But Theoden is also questing for 1 each turn, while Cirdan can quest for 4 or make a huge combat impact with his ring.

T)  Bombur.  Dain makes dwarf decks overpowering, and Armored Destrier makes him useful for defense as well.  Bombur helps you get to 5 dwarves quickly, but his greatness ends there.

U)  SpEowyn.  Eowyn's more efficient than Elfhelm, but Elfhelm is more fun, and I like TaEowyn better than SpEowyn as a splash hero.

V) Bifur.  LeAragorn and his wonderful toys are just too good.

W)  Ori.  Tough call, Ori is great in a dwarf deck, but Mablung is about all there is for Tactics resource acceleration, and tactics can use a lot of resources.

X)  Idraen.  I don't vote against heroes that define decks, and Hirluin is Mr. Outlands.

Y)  Eomer.  I've been playing Amarthiul with Elfhelm, and Amarthiul at 4/4 with an Armored Destrier is a thing of beauty.

Z)  Erkenbrand.  Rossiel has her own deck type, and it's not like anything else.

AA)  Galdor.  LeDenethor has extra resources, resource smoothing, and good defensive potential.  Galdor's ability is most useful in a Noldor deck, but Noldor has a lot of good options without him.

AB)  Beorn.  Hate to vote for him because he's so powerful and so unlike anything else, but Celeborn is required for Silvan decks.

AC)  Treebeard.  Hate to vote for him because he's so powerful and so unlike anything else, but LoPippin is an indispensible part of Hobbit secrecy decks, and Treebeard blocks his totally awesome ally.

AD)  Fatty Bolger.  Biggest mismatch here.  Damrod's the essential hero for trap decks, while Fatty's ability works against the hobbit secrecy type and is only useful in splash if you quest unsuccesfully.  Maybe when Valour decks become a thing Fatty will be better...

AE) Imrahil.  While it's usually better to ready Imrahil than for Faramir to ready an ally, Faramir's ability is a lot easier to trigger.  Works beautifully with Lore ents.

ROUND 1

A:Legolas-Tactics Merry - Legolas is much more splashable
B:Thalin-Leadership Boromir - Boromir enables Gondor decks
C:Lore Faramir-Lore Glorfindel - Both bad, but G. can heal
D:Nori-Spirit Pippin - No comment :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]
E:Frodo-Ori - Best Hobbit defender
F:Dúnhere-Halbarad - Both unused most of the time, but Dunhere is part of some fun decks
G:Óin-Glóin - Never use Oin.
H:Elladan-Caldara - E. Needs his brother, limiting deckbuilding possibilities. Caldara enables a unique deck.
I:Beregond-Balin - Beregond defends just to good and got some great stuff in FotW to make him even better
J:Spirit Glorfindel-Lanwyn - Hard choice, but in the end Glorfindels stats just beat out Lanwyn, who only really shines when the encounterdeck surges quite often
K:Dwalin-Eleanor - Don't see any of them really often, but Eleanor is good in 3 or 4 Player quests with relly bad treacheries.
L:Háma-Gimli - Close, but I like the Hama tricks better than the Gimli power
M:Tactics Aragorn-Elrohir - E. (again) Needs his brother. Came to like A. (t) in multiplayer very much.
N:Thorin Oakenshield-Tactics Théoden - Not a fan of any of them, but Thorin actually does something :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]
O:Brand Son of Bain-Gríma - No question for me
P:Dori-Bard the Bowman - Dori is just bad and Bard can be one of the hardest hitting heroes in the game without attachments.
Q:Spirit Théoden-Lore Denethor - Close, but the Rohan decks T. enables beat Encounter deck manipulation
R:Mirlonde-Beravor - No way -3 threat (at best) beats Beravor
S:Círdan the Shipwright-Théodred - Both are good, but I don't like the threat of Cirdan.
T:Dain Ironfoot-Bombur - Easy decision
U:Éowyn-Elfhelm - Close, but Eowyn is awesome and Elfhelm "only" good
V:Leadership Aragorn-Bifur - Bifur ressource smoothing is great for dwarf decks.
W:Mablung-Ori - Cards > ressources
X:Hirluin the Fair-Idraen - Even though Hirluin is only good with outlands, Idraen does nothing if you don't have a Location or fail to explore it
Y:Éomer-Amarthíul - Amarthuil is just soo good, especially in a Dunendain deck
Z:Rossiel-Erkenbrand - If you could Combo ravenwinged helm with Elfhelm I would vote rossiel, but as it stands I prefer the victory Display mechnaic
AA:Leadership Denethor-Galdor of the Havens - The Denethor power start is great.
AB:Beorn-Celeborn - SILVANS!
AC:Treebeard-Lore Pippin - T. Needs so much healing :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]
AD:Damrod-Fatty Bolger - ...
AE:Leadership Faramir-Prince Imrahil - Rare see great use of Faramirs ability

## 24 [Glowwyrm on August 9, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/226636-the-worst-hero/?do=findComment&comment=2355623)

ROUND 1

A:Legolas: His ally version is such a staple in my Tactics decks that I hardly use the hero anymore.  Tactics Merry is awesome, and just became better with the possibility of solo-mono Tactics.
B:Thalin: Artwork does it here.  While Leadermir is the inferior Boromir, he's still pretty good (using him in my Flame of the West campaign at the moment).  Thalin is experiencing a revival (I think) with all the new direct damage cards, but I'll give the nod to better character and art.
C:Lore Faramir:  Lore Glorfindel was useful in the Core Set days and is still underrated as a hero, in my opinion.  Poor Lore Faramir, despite looking good, has never found his niche.
D:Spirit Pippin:  Nori is really good in a dwarf deck.  Spirit Pippin ought to win (lose?) this competition.
E:Frodo: I don't play dwarves anymore, so I had to look up what Ori did.  How could I forget the lynchpin to the old dwarven archetype?
F:Dúnhere: Tough call.  Neither are great, but neither are bad either.  But if I have to pick one, I'll vote down Dunhere, whose staging area attack is now overshadowed by Haldir.
G:Oin: Showers of resources wins out over dual sphere.
H:Elladan: Caldara just keeps getting better.  Elladan only makes it into decks because his brother is so good.
I:Balin: I like Balin's shadow cancellation, but Beregond is still a beast.
J:Lanwyn: Spirit Glorifndel is still really good.
K:Dwalin: Eleanor has a handful of quests in which she is totally clutch.  Dwalin has a handful of quests in which he is sort of useful.
L:Gimli:  There are many different decks that can be built around Hama's ability, my most recent being a Skyward Volley deck that sniped enemies over and over.  I built a Gimli Firefoot deck a while ago that was pretty fun and haven't touched him since.  Here's hoping we get a new Gimli in Sands of Harad. 
M:Elrohir: tough call, because Elrohir is excellent, but he doesn't match the sheer fun of pulling enemies over with Aragorn.
N:Thorin Oakenshield: Tactics Theoden is quite good now!  He can do lots of things, whether its defending with Golden Shield, attacking with Herugrim, or a bit of both, and with Snowmane he can quest too.  Plus he boosts his niece to 5 willpower (go figure, the Tactics combo of Eowyn-Theoden quests for more than their Spirit counterparts).  Thorin is good, but I haven't played dwarves in ages.
O:Brand Son of Bain:  I like Brand, but he's smelling a fart in the wind.
P:Dori: Bard looks awesome and is very good in multiplayer.  Dori looks awesome and isn't any good at all.
Q:Lore Denethor: Santa marshals his troops pretty well.
R:Mirlonde: Berevor has made it back into so many of my decks: Dundain and Ents being two where she's played a key role.  Mirlonde is good, but Lore Pippin usually takes the spot she would hold.
S:Theodred: I'm an unabashed fan of the Noldor.
T:Bombur: I guess if you have to pick between two dwarves
U:Elfhelm: New Eowyn greatly outshines the old, and Elfhelm is pretty fun to build around.  He not only makes mounts more useful, but songs as well.
V:Bifur: tough call, both are good, but I'll give the nod to good old Coragorn
W:Ori:Wait, Ori was on the ballot already, right?  Mablung is good in almost every Tactics deck.
X:Hirluin the Fair: Friends don't let friends play Outlands.
Y:Amarthíul: Tough call, because both are good.  I'll give the nod to Eomer.
Z:Erkenbrand: He's a good defender, but we have loads of those.  Rossiel has a wholly unique place in this game.
AA:Galdor of the Havens: This is the version of Denethor we've always wanted.  Galdor is good, but overshadowed by his ally version and his other Noldor heroes.
AB:Beorn: The bear is good, but I'll take the leader of the Silvan.
AC:Treebeard: Tough call.  I like Treebeard ally better, and Pippin fits into so many decks.
AD:Fatty Bolger: No contest.  Damrod is actually good, and Fatty is not.
AE:Leadership Faramir: For old timesakes, I'll give the nod to the Prince, who has been putting in work since the first cycle.  I think he's about to be overshadowed by his new version though.  Leader Faramir is good, but he mostly fits into Ent decks, which is kind of thematically weird.

B:Lore Faramir-Spirit Pippin - No comment
C:Frodo Baggins-Dúnhere - Frodo is solid, Dunhere only cheesy
D:Óin-Elladan - The twins deck is not so bad and surely fun to play
E:Balin-Lanwyn - Very Close! I Chose Balin, because Lanwyn is relative unique at dealing with surge and Balins shadow Change has many alternatives these days
F:Dwalin-Gimli - Gimli is an attack monster
G:Elrohir-Tactics Théoden - If you vote for one...
H:Brand Son of Bain-Dori - Brand can actually be useful
I:Lore Denethor-Mirlonde - Denethor is not bad just doesn't fit many decks
J:Théodred-Bombur - both deliver a form of Utility, but Theodred does it better in most cases
K:Elfhelm-Bifur - Close, but Elfhelm is new and shiny :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

A:Tactics Merry-Thalin (While the HP of our enemies has gone up and up Thalin's ability becomes less usefull)
B:Lore Faramir-Spirit Pippin (Just useless...)
C:Frodo Baggins-Dúnhere (Man the heroes to chose from get worse and worse every round ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] Dunhere has just not the power to kill enemys anymore)

E:Balin-Lanwyn (Lanwyn gets really hard matchups but I would choose her over Balin)
F:Dwalin-Gimli (Another dwarf matchup, Dwalin looses this one clearly against Gimli)
G:Elrohir-Tactics Théoden (Tactics Théoden is just not useful, sorry)
H:Brand Son of Bain-Dori (Dori still going strong in this contest :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] )
I:Lore Denethor-Mirlonde (Denethor can do a better job in defending then Mirlonde can do in anything)

K:Elfhelm-Bifur (Elfhelm is so great, why is he still in this poll?)

M:Éomer-Erkenbrand (Seriously? Both heroes are great and don't deserve a spot here...)
N:Galdor of the Havens-Beorn (Can't vota against the bear :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] )

P:Prince Imrahil-Bilbo Baggins and Spirit Merry were missing here. Just choose once and then him or Imra. (Bilbos stats are crap AND he has 9 starting threat which is wayyyyyyyyy to much)

 

Seems like dwarfs have a really tough time here. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] After all they are not great if you can't play them with Dain. But they will have Fatty Bolger and Bilbo as there safty net but. Even Dori could stand against those two hobbits. :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

A. Thalin.  Tactics Merry is more useful and more interesting

B. SpPippin.  Lore Faramir may have issues, but SpPippin is worthless.

C. Dunhere.  Indestructable wins out over a 3-strength attack to staging.

D. Oin.  Oin's 5-dwarves bonuses just aren't that impressive

E. Lanwyn.  Balin's shadow replacement for anyone outweighs a one-time surge boost.

F.  Dwalin.  Gimli is excellent

G. Elrohir.  TaTheoden made mono-tactics solo plausible, while Elrohir needs his brother.

H. Brand.  Brand is better when there's another deck with characters that have a good exhausting ability, but Dori can make himself useful more generally.

I.  Mirlonde.  Denethor has great defensive potential, and his scrying is *very* powerful in solo.

J. Bombur.  He helps you get to five dwarves faster, but takes a slot that could benefit from a five-dwarf power.

K.  Bifur.  Elfhelm's buffs are very useful.

L.  Idraen.  Ori's card draw is one of the most powerful 5-dwarf abilities.

M.  Eomer.  I value defense > attack in a hero.

N.  Galdor.  Beorn is unique and powerful, while Galdor's ability works best in Noldor, but blocks his ally that was born to be in Noldor decks.

O.  Fatty.  Treebeard is awesome.  Fatty is worthless.

P.  Bilbo.  Threat cost is too high for a hobbit deck, while Merry is awesome in a hobbit/secrecy deck, and Imrahil's readying ability comes when you need it.

## 43 [Kjeld on August 15, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/226636-the-worst-hero/?do=findComment&comment=2366939)

A: Spirit Pippin - SpPippin is in it to win it, and Thalin still has a place in direct damage decks (which seem to be getting more support in recent packs).

B: Óin - Dunhere has a unique and fun ability, even if it's underpowered these days.

C: Dwalin - Balin is splashable with a great utility ability. Dwalin not so much.

D: Dori - No contest, SpPippin's primary competitor.

E: Bombur - Mirlonde is more useful in a variety of decks. Bombur isn't awful, but has a very niche role.

F: Ori - Again, Ori is too specialized compared to Bifur's utility resource smoothing and excellent low starting threat.

G: Erkenbrand - There are simply better defenders in leadership, I think, and his ability is too limited. He's boosted by hero Elfhelm and the Armored Destrier for sure, but the destrier makes his ability largely redundant...

H: Fatty Bolger - Bilbo can be a beast in solo play, Fatty can be occasionally helpful in 4-player (though he's better with release of Elevenses). No contest.

## 44 [dalestephenson on August 15, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/226636-the-worst-hero/?do=findComment&comment=2367091)

A.  Spirit Pippin.  The eventual winner, he has an ability that actively works against the dominant hobbit deck strategy.  Plus his Lore version is a staple in the hobbit deck.

B.  Oin.  Dunhere is overshadowed by Haldir, but Oin is overshadowed by nearly all the dwarf deck bonus heroes.

C.  Dwalin.  His ability is worthless in an orc-free quest, of which there are many, and his 2 attack isn't much to kill those orcs with.

D.  Elrohir.  My objection to Elrohir is the same as the last three rounds, he's tied at the hip to his brother hero.  Without his brother in play, he has an ability that is at odds with his stats.  Dori's dramatically outclassed by Beregond outside a dwarf deck, but I've found his ability to be quite useful in a wide variety of fellowships.

E.  Bombur.  Mirlonde's threat decrease isn't much, but Bombur's get-to-five ability is a problem because of all the other excellent dwarves that could be used ahead of him -- and with 1 attack and 0 willpower, even Dain doesn't make him an asset.

F.  Bifur.  Ori's arguably the best of the get-to-five.  Card draw is amazingly powerful.

G.  Galdor.  Galdor's ability is best in a Noldor deck, but his ally version is one of the best assets to a Noldor deck.

H.  Fatty.  Bilbo's overpriced, but his ability is powerful.  For only two less threat, Fatty provides an ability that is very, very niche yet requires exhaustion (though losing Fatty's action isn't much of a loss).

I do have a suggestion.

The "Best Hero Championchip" has this 1on1 pyramid sceme until the end. But probably you should switch in round 4 or 5 to each-against-everyone. So we would get some sort of ranking, not only just the single most worst hero.

ROUND 3

A:Thalin-Spirit Pippin (Ok finaly the dwarf faction gets a break here :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] )

B:Dúnhere-Óin (Man oh man it gets really messy in these votes this round. I like the rohan faction more then dwarfs so Oin gets the round here)

C:Balin-Dwalin (The battle of the dwarfs goes on, this one is actually a pretty easy vote)

D:Elrohir-Dori (Upper bracket final against Pippin incoming!)

E:Mirlonde-Bombur (Both not that useful, Mirlonde at least for lowering starting thread in a mono lore deck)

F:Bifur-Ori (Another dwarf battle, Ori is in my dwarf swarm deck so Bifur gets the vote here)

G:Erkenbrand-Galdor of the Havens (Puh why are both of these still in this contest? I have used Erkenbrand more so Galdor it is)

H:Fatty Bolger-Bilbo Baggins (Fatty all the way! Final against Pippin seems more then likely)

 

All in all this contest turns into a hobbit/dwarf bash ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] But at least for me this is not a really big surprise because dwarfs without Dains buff are not that good of a single hero class and hobbits decks are dominated by Lore-Pippin/Tactics-Merry and the all mighty Sam. Each other hobbit simply does not fit the playstyle of hobbits and are really really bad as single heroes.

ROUND 3

A:Thalin-Spirit Pippin - Thalin is the bane of 1 HP enemies and good in direct damage decks. Spirit Pippin's greatest achievement is to have the same Name as is awesome lore Version.

B:Dúnhere-Óin - Dúnhere is some what unique and Óin Looks a Little like the Designers ran out of ideas for another dwarf hero :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

C:Balin-Dwalin - Dwalin has mediocre use, IF the quest contains a lot of orcs. Balin can always save you from those shadow effects.

D:Elrohir-Dori - Elrohir is good with his brother. Dori is good as the captive in "the uruk-hai".

E:Mirlonde-Bombur - Minus three threat in a mono lore deck? Not really the greatest ability, neither has Bombur, but he defends solid (or at least soaks up direct damage) and enables dwarfs quicker.

F:Bifur-Ori - Card Draw beats the ressource smoothing

G:Erkenbrand - Galdor of the Havens - Close match, but somehow Erkenbrand just doesn't do it. He Looks good on paper for me, but never works out.  

H:Fatty Bolger - Bilbo Baggins - Bilbo's ability is great solo, no question. It's jsut his threat for his stats that looses him his matchups, but good guy Fatty is here to help an old Hobbit out.

Sam/LoPippin/TaMerry is definitely the best all-hobbit solo combo, but I don't agree that all the others are "really really bad" as single heroes.  Bilbo's overcosted, but his ability is great.  Frodo has been used widely as a single hero.  And I like SpMerry a lot as a single hero, low threat and repeatable threat reduction.

Spirit Merry is really good I forgot about him! He's really good for any secrecy deck or decks that ramp up thread quickly (Yeah I see what you did there Boromir! ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] )

Frodo was good in "the old days" because you could handle high attack strength guys but now you go Beregond or Chumpblock so hmmm dunno.... I haven't used him in a veeery long time. Bilbo's ability is great no doubt but he is waaaaaaaay overcosted and his stats are "really really bad" ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] Even for solo play 9 starting thread and literally no contribution to your group (only stat above 1 is defense and with 2 defense and 2 HP he simply can't defend regular enemies nowadays) I would not use him. But sure that's my opinion about him ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

Interesting bracket.  Lots of heroes that are highly situational or specialised (eg.

Mirlonde, all the dwarven throng heroes - hell, even poor old Pippin can be built around).  The glaring exceptions, for me, are Balin and Bifur - two of the most splashable and useful heroes in their respective spheres should never have made it this far.

A:Spirit Pippin-Óin.  The people’s favourite marches on. 
 

B:Dwalin-Dori.  Both have restrictive abilities, but Dwalin’s makes him fairly useful and fun in the right deck and against the right encounter, whereas Dori is still pretty limited even if you build around him.

C:Bombur-Bifur.  I actually like Bombur, but Bifur is head and shoulders above all the remaining contenders.  No real contest here.
 

D:Galdor of the Havens-Fatty Bolger.  I’ve used both to decent effect, but Fatty’s utility is far more inconsistent.

 

 

As a side note, it’d be interesting to see how far Lore Faramir might have come if he hadn’t gone up against Pippin early on...

Spirit Pippin - no explanation necessary.

Dori - I actually like Dwalin. In Khazad-Dum and Dwarrowdelf, he can be an absolute machine with Ever My Heart Rises, an Axe, and Blade of Gondolin. I know they're old quests but he still pulls his weight, unlike Dori who's next to useless.

Bombur - serves only one deck archetype. Bifur is still decent resource smoothing in a sphere with almost none.

Fatty - no explanation necessary.

No vote on the second. I can see uses for both no matter how slight.

A:Spirit Pippin - Dori - If everything fails Dori can defend/attack. Being a dwarf is also much more valuable than being a Hobbit. If ippins ability wouldn't require to run 3 Hobbit heroes I would probably vote for Dori (I could see uses in a staging area attack deck as a life safer)
B:Bombur - Fatty Bolger - I played one game with them each (2 handed, Bombur in one deck, Fatty in the other :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]). While Bombur was a respectable Defender (brand, ally arwen), Fatty did nothing (and I tried to use his ability but it was never worth it).

A) Spirit Pippin.  This one is a ridiculously easy call.  Pippin's ability is useful only in a hobbit-only deck, but raising threat and un-engaging has anti-synergy with the other hobbits.  Every other spirit hero in the game is better than Pippin.

 

Dori's only problem is that Beregond exists.  Beregond has 4 defense, the same threat, also has sentinel, and goes to 6 defense with a free attachment.  Dori just can't compete with him.  But if Beregond *didn't* exist, Dori would not only be not considered a useless hero, I suspect he'd be a popular hero -- you can get to 4+ defense on turn 1 without any attachments, and solid defense is harder to get quickly than solid questing or attack, and preserves board state better.  Dori's 2 defense and 5 hit points for sentinel isn't bad, besides Beregond we have 3/4 for Erkenbrand, 1/10 for Beorn, 2/5 for two of the Aragorns, and 2/4 for both Theodens.  All those other guys have recognized-as-useful powers, but Dori's ability to take a hit is comparable to the other sentinel defenders, of which there are not a lot.  And Dori has one thing all other sentinel defenders lack -- once he's too banged up to defend by himself, *he can still help defend*.  This is important, because while you mostly quest together and attack together, you defend alone.

 

I'm not just theory casting.  I've played a ton of quests now with a variety of two-handed fellowships featuring Dori, and Dori has never failed to be useful.  Yes, his ability requires two hero actions, but when you don't have hero actions to spare (early game), he can defend and survive for either hand.  And when you have hero actions to spare, he can make almost anyone into a solid defender.  Eleanor has to stay ready for her ability, but she's a 2/3 defender until she gets a Gondorian Shield.  Dori turns her into Beregond.  Arwen gets Light of Valinor, Dori turns her into Beregond.  And when the big bosses roll around, two hero actions can be a small price to pay for rock-solid defense.  Try him out -- replacing Dori with Beregond may always make a deck better, but sometimes you don't want to play Beregond, and for the multiplayer set, sometimes someone else is playing Beregond.  Against some bosses, even Beregond can sometimes use a helping hand.

 

So he's strictly inferior to Beregond, and his ability isn't nearly as awesome as it could be (if it buffed allies, everybody would love Dori).  But he's not up against Beregond, he's up against *Spirit Pippin*.

 

B) Fatty Bolger.  Like Dori, Bombur can take a hit.  Unlike Dori, once he gets too banged up to defend his usefulness as a hero is at an end.  However, Bombur's innate ability to be two dwarves can be a real benefit to Thorin and/or Ori, and accelerate the dwarf swarm quicker.  Meanwhile, Fatty has an ability that is rarely useful, and with a 1/1/2/3 stat line his action isn't really useful for anything.  (Well, unless Dori is helping him defend.)

Might be a reason we saw the same spirit hero (yes I'm looking at you Glorfindel!) over and over again for years. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] He got replaced because off Arwen and Glofrindel ally version. If that's better we will see but I'm glad that not every 2nd deck includes him as a hero right now.

 

Now back to topic:

 

A: Spirit Pippin (Dori can be useful but two hero actions for defending is just too much for my taste. Pippin on the other hand is straight useless. Doesn't fit into the hobbit play style and outside of hobbit decks you simply don't want this Pippin version).

B: Fatty Bolger (Bombur can be useful if you plan on the 5 dwarf game mechanic and he can defend decently with a burning brand. Fatty is just a useless hobbit that will have a final battle against Pippin in this contest ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] ).

## 94 [Kolley Kibber on August 22, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/226636-the-worst-hero/?do=findComment&comment=2378663)

A. Spirit Pippin

B. Fatty Bolger

 

 

Spirit heroes not coming off brilliantly in the closing rounds, but on the other hand, Spirit is also the best represented sphere in the list of "best" heroes that kicked off this contest, so it's not all bad news for the blue team.

A: Dori. This matchup ought to be the finals, because I think these are the worst two heroes in the game (though Fatty isnt far behind so no grave injustice has been done). This was a hard decision. Spirit Pippin has always been bad, but when he was released, he at least had a place in the cardpool. There were very few hobbit heroes, and for the first time you could run an all hobbit hero deck. Sure, all of his utility disappeared once Black Riders was released, but for a short time he had a place in this game. Dori was released late enough in this game's life that he has no place and I feel no compulsion to ever try him in a deck. Both of these card will rest in my car box forever, but at least one of them didn't always belong there.

B: Fatty. I've used both to good effect in games, but Bombur's ability is better and he can be an ok defender.

Honestly, it's not terrible as is (in multiplayer)...I can post it later today, but I didn't save what I drafted yesterday (inspired by this thread).  It mainly focuses on combos.  Desperate Alliance + Hobbit-Sense,  Desperate Alliance + Vanish from Sight + Wandering Took + Song of Earendil + O Elbereth! Githonial!,  Good Meal + Out of Sight.  Basically, it's just a support deck that allows your teammates to get set up.  Dori + Fatty allows you to defend for 4 early game until you can find your silly combos.  Hobbit Pipes + Bilbo (ally) and massive threat reduction allow you to dig through your deck quickly enough.  2x Gondorian Shield and 2x Ring Mail get Fatty up to 8 defense when combined with Dori.

 

Is it a great deck? No...but it seemed more useful than various other decks I've seen.  However, it seems Wandering Took will be issued an errata sometime soon so the deck will pretty much fall apart as its most broken combo will be impossible to do.

## 103 [Crabble on August 25, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/226636-the-worst-hero/?do=findComment&comment=2383987)

Final round:

 

A:Spirit Pippin-Fatty Bolger

So both are really bad, both have bad stats both have bad abilities. So based on stats, Pippin has less thread and 2 willpower that might be usefull, Fatty is statswise useless because his only stat above 1 is defense and without Dori, Fatty can't defend. But Pippins ability is simply not useful because you wouldn't want him in an all hobbit deck while Fattys ability might be used if you get Spirit Merry along with him. So all in all really tough and it's a gut decision that gets Pippin the vote. I was just disappointed when he came out and even more so when 2 months later the black rider box appeared and we got a very useful version of Pippin in Lore. But don't be too proud Fatty you're useless too! :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

B:Dori-Bombur

This one is tough too. I used Bombur in some dwarf decks and back in the days when he came out he was quite good in defending especially if you gave him a Dunedain Warning (if you play dwarfs you play Dain and thus leadership) and a Burning Brand (is in sphere for Bombur). Until you got this he really shined (and still does!) in decks where you relayed on the 5 dwarf mechanics because you could play him along 2 other dwarf heroes, put out an Erebor Record Keeper on turn 1 and boom you got your 5 dwarfs together. With Dain and Thorin or Ori he can give you quite a potent solo dwarf deck. On the other hand there is Dori. He came out very recently and was SUCH a disappointment. I mean really... +2 Defense for a lost hero action is not that good. I get his purpose, dwarfs don't have naturally high defense (compared to their willpower/attack strength when you get a bunch of them out and Dain is ready) but because he came out just last year (in 2015!!! he is barely one year old) where you could just throw in Beregond or Erkenbrand or Denethor (not thematic I know) he is just not good in my eyes. Don't get me wrong I can see potential in him but if it comes down for deck building I would use Bombur in dwarf decks because he has a great ability and can be build into a decent defender but wouldn't use Dori in dwarf (maybe if I build 3 dwarf decks that want to work together) or other decks. So sadly Dori gets the vote here. If he would have been in one of the Hobbit Boxes or in the Dwarrowdelf cycle he might have been a great addition to dwarf decks back in the days but nowadays he gets outclassed by other heroes in the defense department.

ROUND 6

A:Pippin: to many enemys have bad side effects when engaging or when still in play. Also, kind of anti social - other team members have to deal with the enemys, right?! :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

B:Bombur: because Doris ability can power up a multi player game. Plus, he is sentinel.

## 105 [dalestephenson on August 25, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/226636-the-worst-hero/?do=findComment&comment=2384030)

A. Pippin.  His ability requires all hobbits, but his ability works against Sam and TaMerry.  Fatty's ability is at least (rarely) useful, though a spirit hero who can't quest, attack, or defend well is problematic.

 

B. Bombur.  Bombur is more useful in a deck with Thorin and Ori.  Dori is more useful with Dain, and also is generally useful in a 2+ player game.

Bombur can be an excellent hero with a fantastic ability in the right deck. Dori can not.

A: Spirit Pippin – Fatty Bolger.  

B: Dori – Bombur.  To add to all the reasons everyone else has given, hero Dori gets further demerits for blocking a generally useful ally (although ally Bombur is pretty fantastic in underground quests).  I will say, though, that dalestephenson’s above comment makes me want to give Dori another shot …

Fatty Bolger. Both Pippin's and Fatty's abilities are terrible and will never be used (or, their abilities are so bad that it's pointless to compare them), so in the end stats matter more, and Pippin at least has more will power and less initial threat.

 

Dori

The Worst Hero contest has finished! Pippin is declared worst hero of all times almost homerunning Fatty who homerunned pretty much everybody who stood in his path! Dori is the third worst hero with just one more vote than Bombur.

## 116 [Lecitadin on August 28, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/226636-the-worst-hero/?do=findComment&comment=2388718)

Dori, I think, is even more a shame because he was released not too long ago... And I remember the recations when he was spoiled, that could resumed to : WTF?

I just hope that they won't release another ''bad'' hero...

But to be fair (and because LOTR LCG is such a good and great game, my favorite, in fact), there are so many truly GRAET heroes!

So now that it's over, I'm wondering how to fit the final four into the same somewhat logical fellowship.

 

Since SpPippin's ability needs hobbits and Bombur needs dwarves, it'd need to be:

 

<Hobbit>/SpPippin/Fatty

 

<Dwarf>/Bombur/Dori

 

The problem here is that Pippin's ability doesn't even work with Fatty, since Fatty's only logical role is a defender (though as a 2/3 defender, he need Dori's help to survive long enough to set up).

## 118 [Rajam on August 31, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/226636-the-worst-hero/?do=findComment&comment=2393401)

I'm surprised by how many people consider Bilbo a bad hero; if his starting threat were 6, he'd probably be considered amongst the best heroes (much like Lore Pippin), so I wonder... is the extra +3 threat really that bad?

## 119 [Crabble on August 31, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/226636-the-worst-hero/?do=findComment&comment=2393425)

Seems so! Think of it for just one more threat you can get Beravor which gives anyone that needs cards 2 instead of 1. Yes you have to exhaust her but what will you do with Bilbos action? His stats are really bad, so maybe 1 willpower to the quest? That's not a kind of hero action you want in your deck. Even in soloplay I would not want him in my hero lineup because you would need a lot of help out of the extra cards you get from him to compensate for his lack of stats. With 9 (or if you get one more) or 10 starting thread you can pick 70% of all heroes in the card pool right now and Bilbo is not in the top shelf in that category.
