Dose unique mean you can not cast it at all, or can you cast it and replace the other version of the unique?

I think the manual says something to the effect of "the card remains in its place" if you try to play it, so you could blow the resources but the card would  stay in your hand.  Lets see if I can find it...

 

here ya go:

 

If any player has a unique card in play, no player can
play or put into play another card with the same title.
Any attempt to do so will fail to the extent that the card
attempting to enter play remains in its current location
(hand, deck, discard pile) and does not enter play.

yup... thanks man. That is perfect.. so if vilya fails the card remains in the draw pile and is not lost.
