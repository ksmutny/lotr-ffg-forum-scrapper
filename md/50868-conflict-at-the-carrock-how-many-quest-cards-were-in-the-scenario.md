# [Conflict at the Carrock - How many quest cards were in the scenario?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/50868-conflict-at-the-carrock-how-many-quest-cards-were-in-the-scenario/)

I picked up CatC today and when I opened it up there were only 2 quest cards, 1A/B and 2A/B.

Are there only two stages to this scenario, or am I missing a card?

Woah! Where did you get it!?!

Give us some details!

I'm sure that it's possible only to have two scenario cards, I wouldn't worry. Does the last one say, "if you ____ the players have won the game" ?

No, it doesn't have that phrase.

The Fantasy Flights store in MN started selling them today. Unfortunatly, I will be far to busy to update the database until next week.

 i went on FFGs "Shop" page to see if it was on sale...darn. it's not. but i did see this description that I don't recall reading anywhere else:

"Conflict at the Carrock contains 60 fixed cards from the Shadows of Mirkwood cycle, continuing the heroes’ quest to find and apprehend the creature Gollum. A new hero joins the quest, along with three copies of nine new player cards from all four spheres, a new deck of Encounter cards, and the Conflict at the Carrock Quest cards.

A variety of new player cards offer exciting deck-building options, featuring new and familiar faces. Frodo Baggins is beginning to feel restless in the Shire while the Beorning Beekeepers offer their assistance to anyone willing to help drive the troublesome Trolls away. A Long-beard Mapmaker discovers a hidden Dúnedain Warning that just might help the heroes avoid defeat.

Conflict at the Carrock focuses on the lumbering Trolls terrorizing the Beornings, and while facing them in combat is fearful enough, Sacked! cards will endanger your heroes at every turn. Muck Adders will snap at your heels while you try to navigate the difficult locations surrounding the Carrock."

Sacked! sounds interesting!

It's from the article, "There Be Trolls Here," my good sir.

ugh. and i read that article before too. guess i forgot.

i started another thread with the other info from the Shop; and I swear I thought I'd never read the info on the other expansions before, either. But maybe I'm just crazy. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Here you go, I added one just for you [http://lotrlcg.com/cardFocus.php?Title=Grimbeorn%20The%20Old]. This is by far the most interesting card in the pack, and now I have to figure how to make it display properly....

 

I looked through the pack some more, and I am not missing any sequencially, and there are 60 cards. Quest card 2B however says "Players cannot defeat this stage if there are any Troll enemies in play." I hope there isn't a printing error with this pack.

very cool; thanks!

looks like he enters play somewhere other than for a player...and then gets added to your "side" (so to speak) once 8 tokens are on him? steep cost...but awesome ally.

Very cool! Thank you!

I wonder if he starts in play or if he comes out of the encounter deck like the other objective cards

I would assume he is an Encounter Card, since he is an Objective Type.

But he is not Guarded, so you add him to the Staging Area, then you can spen Resources over time until you fill his quota. When you do he "joins" the First player.

I guess that is how you play him.

Seems that Song of Kings should be used here (for anyone not using a Leadership deck) or there are other cards in this expansion that twist/change/add resources...

Pure conjecture at this point, but this scenario may not end with a quest card but instead at the Carrock location...
