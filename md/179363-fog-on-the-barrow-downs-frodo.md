If I am playing Fog on the Barrow-Downs in campaign mode, do I include ring-bearer Frodo Baggins?  I don't see anything that would indicate I should, but it seems very strange not to have him along.  Thanks in advance for your advice.

If you're in campaign mode, you're supposed to use the heroes that are on your campaign log -- and that includes your Ring-bearer, who you record at the beginning of the campaign.  Right now Frodo is the only possible Ring-bearer, so yeah I use him.

 

I asked the same question awhile back in a thread here [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/128257-do-you-play-fog-on-the-barrow-downs-with-fellowship-frodo/?hl=barrow-downs], if you're interested.

The setup card for Fog on the Barrow-downs says: "To play Fog on the Barrow-downs in campaign mode, follow the setup instructions found on page 2 of The Black Riders rules insert."  Page 2 of said rules insert reads: "...the first player must take control of a hero from the Fellowship sphere with the Ring-bearer trait at the beginning of each game and attach The One Ring to that hero.

 

Short answer: Yes. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Thank you for your reply, GrandSpleen.  I should have done a better search before posting my question, but I appreciate the info you gave me, and enjoyed reading the thread you pointed me to.  Thank you also, Ecthelion III.  If all else fails, read the card, right? :lol: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_laugh.png] I sure appreciate everyone's patience and help -- it really helps me enjoy the game.
