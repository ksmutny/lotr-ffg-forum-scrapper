The new shadow expansion packs come with a lot of enemies with 5 ATKs which is a nightmare for me. Plus most enemies have 4+ HPs and 2+ defense. How am i supposed to beat such those quests with 3 heroes?

Try a deck I have been using lately solo and is awesome.  Tracker1 built it and it is Beregond, Eowyn and Glorfindel(Spirit).  I can beat almost any quest.  Almost beat Dol Guldur with this one, but not quite.

i have to disagree- this game is far easier solo than at the start of the game- there has been a definite switch in difficulty to more playes than less. however some questions....

1. what is your card pool? those quests are designed with a certain level of cards in mind (even an lcg has some amount of needing to buy certain packs)

2.which heroes are you running? in addition to spurries deck i can recommend some decks.

here is one which can kill ithillien:

 

theodred

glorfindel

bifur

 

(13)

gildor x1

erestor x1

arwen x1

riversong x1

northern tracker x3

gleowine x1

faramir x1

gandalf x3

elfhelm x1

 

(10)

resourceful x3

steward of gondor x3

asfaloth x1

light of valinor x3

 

(24)

risk some light x3

test of will x3

dwarven tomb x2

dearons runes x3

wealth of lorien x3

elronds counsel x3

will of the west x1

sneak attack x3

timely aid x3

 

that is only 47, so i am not sure what i had in the remaining 3 slots as i dont have the deck built anymore. basically you HAVE to have a good hand that takes advantage of the secrecy of 20, so mulligan for a timely aid which can get gildor in round 1 (thats a 5 cost ally in round 1 for 1 cost!) resourceful for 1 cost, and risk some light is key.

 

actually speaking of risk some light- you can fill the 3 slots with the lampwright who combos nicely to get rid of surge.

the deck has 1 copy of unique allies for theme but its also a good strategy as you dont have any wasted cards.

 

the deck is really fast and you can get threat down to 0 so you dont need to worry about high attack enemies- you can choose to engage them when you are prepared and have about 10 allies out.

 

also another way, and i know many gamers hate this, is to specifically build for a scenario. for instance a good deck for cair andros solo is:

 

beregond

hama

legolas

 

and lots of defense allies such as defender of the rammas, winged guardien etc.

 

you have to be careful to not overquest though as you want either siege or battle keyword in play, so not 2b

There are a lot of really good decks out there if you have the cards to build them with.

 

 If you hunt around a bit in the different forums BoardGameGeek, CardGameDB and here, as well as the various Blogs, Tales from the Card, Hall of Beorn, Master of Lore and I'm sure I'm forgetting many,  You will be able to find a deck that can beat any quest in the game Solo.

 

The the quests in the current ATS cycle seem to be easier solo than multiplayer, and they give us Outlands which can really make many quests including the most recent look like a joke.

 

Spurries, thanks for the nod.  I happy someone found that deck, I think it's a really good one, and pretty fun to play.  I put that together after I got bored with outlands, and was pleasantly surprised  by it.

No problem, this and Master of Lore's 'Prisoner of the Forest' decks have become my two favorite I think.  Loading up heroes with attachments is much more fun than just having 20 allies out for me.  I basically dont try that one against Hobbit quests as it has no shadow cancellation for 'Wind Whipped Rain' which is basically a game over card for attachment decks.

I play almost exclusively solo, and while some quests are definitely more challenging than others for a solo player, there's nothing so far that can't be beaten. If you're having trouble beating quests solo, then maybe you just need try a different deck strategy.

## 7 [Cutievalkyrie on July 25, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87076-this-game-becomes-unsoloable/?do=findComment&comment=822191)

Heirs of Numenor has two quests with difficulty level of 4 and 5.

To me they are extremely hard comparing with those core set quests(i can beat core set and circle mirkawood level 5 quests at ease).

for me difficulty levels mean nothing. it depends on your card pool, your deck building experience and how many players are in the game. thats too many variables to just apply 1 difficulty level, therefore i think it is meaningless to say 'this is a level 5, 6 etc' ....but i guess they are an ok-ish way to tell quest difficulty at an average, so it does have some design appeal

 

so in short, mirkwood level 5 does not = HoN level 5

I agree with this. I've heard on the ultradifficulty of HoN quests but I feel those are easier playing solo. I said they are easier, not easy. The bigger card pool helps a lot. But there's more:

 

It may be because revealing less cards makes Encounter Deck more predictable? This is always been this way... except for a few quests where player needs to reveal many cards to win (Return to Roshgobel).

 

What's new then? Is it just because Siege and Battle keywords makes deckbuilding easier? These keywords somehow makes the Quest and Combat phases more similar, because you can use Denethor or Veteran of Nanduhirion on both phases effectively. In some cases, the cards have become even better, like Northern Tracker.

I understand you!!!! But did you try Amon Din? I really cannot call it difficult (and I hate difficult quests, I would say it ;-))

yes, i do think that the encounter deck throws more nasties at you in multiplay....theres just more horrible combinations of cards that can come out compared to the early game, so i think cards like risk some light and the lampwright really makes a difference

I've played Amon Din solo about half a dozen times now, and I just never come close to losing. I'm a little disappointed with this one, actually, given the great quests we've been having recently. That said, I've never come close to losing Druadan Forest, either. Here's hoping the rest of the cycle ramps up the difficulty.

i lost it 3 times in a row and am proud of it :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] ....for some reason i can either kill quests or lose them terribly. at least my replayability of this game is higher than most!

how? what happened when you lost? you dont try to lose do you? 

## 16 [richsabre on July 26, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87076-this-game-becomes-unsoloable/?do=findComment&comment=823293)

no, why on earth would i try to do that? :blink: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_blink.png] (not sure if thats meant to be a shocked face or not)

but i rarely put together decks that win either. with the exception of the deck i have posted previously, i usually throw together theme decks or decks filled with cards i like the art of. its how i get most enjoyment out of this game...

 

as for loosing, the first time i remember i got a shadow card that was the one that gives you an extra shadow card, this gave me the one which gives extra cards per player so it was +2, one of those was one that gave an extra +2 ....i cant remember properly but in the end i got 9 shadow cards!..so that didnt particularly help (and yes they were properly shuffled)

...... this just made me realize I've been playing Amon Din with wrong encounter deck.

I've been playing with the Bandit encounter sets instead of the Orc one... I thought Bandits joined in on pillaging the village but Orcs would make lot more sense.

 

Jeesh, I've been struggling to keep Alcaron alive from those Traitors, but I guess this quest just got lot easier for me.

 

 

As for OP, I find decks focused on early game rather than ones that takes 2~3 turns to build up works better against HoN quests.

Give Beorn + Elrond + Eleanor/Frodo/Spirit Glorfindel a try.

Load the deck with usual elven trinkets + lots of 1~2 cost tactics allies + 1 copy each of expensive allies from every sphere + Zigil Miner & Stargazer & Will of West and see how it works out.

Just i play 4 games 2 playe,r wtih Outlands deck and Elornd vilya silvan deck. Play SF, DF and Return to Mirkwood  NM and Journey down to Anduin NM.  Win all. Very easy and boring. Only last quest give us some good challenge. Other quests was so easy so we cannot stop yamming during the games. After Briliant HON so boring to play. Outlands is really broken!

 

I dont know first time for all this years we decide to play some other game next time..... I feel pretty sad about it. But looks like the game didm provide any challenge for multi player now. I still an play solo but for multy player maybe i try some other game.
