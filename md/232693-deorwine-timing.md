His card says...

 

Action: While Deorwine is defending, spend 1 leadship resource to cancel a shadow effect dealt to the attacking enemy. Any player may trigger this action.

 

Can you do this after the shadow card is revealed? I'm not sure as it's an action, unlike Erkenbrand which is a response and uses the phrase "just revealed".

The fact Deorwine's ability is an action is a mistake, it should be a response.

Wow, where did you read that? Still, can his Response be used when the shadow card is revealed? I just find it odd that it doesn't say "just revealed" like Erkenbrand.

> I believe Deorwine’s ‘Action’ should be a ‘Response’ to allow his ability to work as intended. His effect is meant to cancel the shadow effect after it is revealed and before it resolves in a similar fashion to Hasty Stroke.

Nice. Thanks. I like that it can work for multiple shadow cards, if you have the resources.

That makes sense. As an action it made no sense, given previous rulings on cancellation of shadow effects via shadow card discard did not work in many cases.

 

So will this become an official errata?
