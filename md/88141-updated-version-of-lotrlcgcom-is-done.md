Hey everyone, the update version of LotrLCG.com [http://LotrLCG.com] is complete! This spring I did a complete rebuild and redesign of the site. There is some new stuff, the biggest addition is card and scenario ratings. You can rate scenarios [http://www.lotrlcg.com/Scenario/Scenario/1003]based on replayability, theme, and difficulty. 

 

A big thanks to Tom Howard, aka GeckoTH, who has been doing all updating of content and images!

 

If you have a podcast or deckbuilding blog that you want added to the Resource [http://www.lotrlcg.com/Resources] page, email me at [myusername]@gmail.com.

When I choose a scenario to be rated in the list, it always redirects me to "Escape from Dol Guldur".

Thanks for letting me know rekath16. I know what's causing it, I'll be able to fix it when I get home.

Other thing what I noticed is, that I cannot read comments. By clicking on a comment it redirects me to the card page but nowhere a comment can be seen. For example Bilbo Baggins (lore) has in the search page currently 1 comment but nothing on his personal page.

does the report error function actually work (just curious?) a lot of cards are mislabeled (attachments are tagged as events, etc), some cards don't have their stats.

 

also, the sort by stats function didn't work last night, either.

Yeah, the error report function works. It generates a list that Mason and I can see. I saw the report for Blood of Numenor, and tried to change it to an Attachment myself, though it wasn't saving properly for me. Mason, any ideas there?

 

If there are errors or missing data on other cards, post 'em here or report them on the site. I'll do what I can to correct 'em!

 

Also, Assault on Osgiliath has been uploaded as well.

perfect - blood of numenor was a card i flagged - but there were more spirit events/attachment confusion (i just can't remember which ones...)

Still not working scenario rating.

Also in the scenario section there are only scenarios until Shadows & Flame +2 POD available to choose. Other problem is there: For example difficulty: I can give points for "bad" to "gorgeos". In the playercards this makes sense, but here? I didnt know ho to answer... Bad difficutly would mean, in my opinion the difficulty is bad designed or in my opinion the difficulty is low?

 

Better call it "low to high" difficulty.

Not to give you more work, but the adventure rule sheets would be a nice addition. (At least the front side.)

Thx for you work, you two!
