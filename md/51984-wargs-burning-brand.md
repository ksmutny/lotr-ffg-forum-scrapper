# [Wargs + Burning Brand?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/51984-wargs-burning-brand/)

We had the situation yesterday that a hero with burning brand blocked Wargs. Is the Warg returned to the staging area after the dealt shadow card's effect is cancelled? We couldnt agree whether the emphasis was on "dealt" or "no effect" in "If Wargs is dealt a shadow card with no effect..."

I would say the Shadow card still has an effect, so the Wargs stay engaged. I don't think the Burning Brand has a bearing on the Wargs check.

 I read it as "if Wargs are dealt a shadow card that has no shadow effect on it, then..."  I think that cancelling the shadow effect will not determine what the Wargs do.

I think that cancelling a shadow effect has no bearing on whether or not a shadow card has a shadow effect to begin with.  If an effect is cancelled, its still an effect, it just doesn't affect anything.
