Yes I love your videos they are the best.  But  if you ask me, please do do any more Thorin and Co. deck videos since I am so sick of that deck.  The outlands was cool vs JDTA.  Keep swiching up the decks and quests.  Again your video's are my fav LOTR LCG videos. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]  Keep it up.

like the new deck using the elves. I am not really into theme decks as they usally suck a lot more than fanboys admit but it is good to see somone using the Gildor / Vilya combo for once. Cool stuff.

I dont mind if i lost since this how you learn how to win. Art of losing is also important special in competive games.....

I really wait for hunt for gollum nightmare and KD nightmare. Should be awesome

Sorry for long answer i was busy a bit. What is mean Otd quests?

Yes i plan to make a Hobbit story but use only cards from core set and both Hobbit boxes. Include the heroes. And if hero i dead cannot use him anymore. Should be fun and challenge. In this case there is a point maybe to use Bilbo events and tresures cards

*O*n *T*he *D*oorstep.  Can totally understand if your busy (I sure am) but when can I expect more videos?  I would much more prefer the HObbit on the Doorstep quests videos since Over Hill and Under hill are very simple and easy (to me at least) but totally up to you.

Nicely played and thanks for your kind words. It's cool to see the deck played by someone else.

One thing I had been curious about this quest is when Murzag is defeated by Dunhere in the staging area, and then we advance to stage 2 and Alcaron is added to the stating area, we are still in the combat phase, right? Correct me if I am wrong, but if Dunhere had UC on him he would then be able to hit Alcaron in the staging area before the combat phase ends. I played it both ways with attacking him and not jsut in case i was playing it wrong. It really does not make much of a difference, but it is slightly easier since when Alcaron is engaged the next round he already has damage on him. You did not play it that way, so I'm just curious if that's not legal.

Other scenarios when a quest card changes and a card is drawn that deals damage to all characters commited to the quest would still do damage since changing the quest card does not close the phase. So, it might me a legal attack on Alcaron.

Any thoughts on this?

Thanks for trying it.

P.S. I think you will enjoy NM CatC

As always great playthrough Glaurung. Wish I could build this deck but I only have one core set... oh well...

> As always great playthrough Glaurung. Wish I could build this deck but I only have one core set... oh well...

Thank you. Im glad you like it! You can build up this deck with one core set. I have 2 core set so I use only 2 copies of u courage and 2 copies of dwarven tomb.

You can replace some cards it will effect but no so much

## 27 [Tracker1 on January 13, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85635-glaurung-play-through-youtube-channel/?do=findComment&comment=953137)

> As always great playthrough Glaurung. Wish I could build this deck but I only have one core set... oh well...

If you want to try the deck with just one core set and are opposed to using proxies, here is what i would suggest doing for the 6 cards you would need to replace.

I would put in Miruvor x3

I can see a nice combo if this is played on Dunhere and you have Foe Hammer in hand. After you declare Dunhere as an attacker ready him with Miruvor and put it back on top of your deck. After you destroy the enemy play Foe Hammer. Get Miruvor back in hand with 2 more cards, and then Dunhere is ready to attack again.

That should take care of the missing 2 UC.

Feint, Light in the dark, Galadhrim's Greeting only come with 2 copies in core set and you only have 1 Dwarven tomb.

Since you only need 3 cards since you added an extra Miruvor

I think I would add 2 Map of Earnil to play the roll of the missing Dwarven Tomb. I put an extra Map in since you will be able to fetch back copies of Light in the Dark or the Greeting since there are no replacement cards for those in the deck. It will cost 2 to play, but should not be an issue. Especially it you get Song of Travel on Merry.

To take the roll of the last Feint, you could add quick strike which would allow Dunhere to possibly dispatch the enemy before it attacks. Also if the Miruvor does not seem to work as intended I would remove 1 and add a second QS.

Hope that helps, and If you do try it let me know how it goes. It is a fun deck and I think replacing the six cards as suggested will not alter how it plays too much. I would be curious if it could handle MV with these modifications.

I have not played Rhosgobel either. Never really enjoyed that scenario much, and having to deal with more damage on the Eagle does not sound intriguing, but I will give it a go at some point. Anyone out there try it?

The other 2 scenarios are great, although THfG is not so difficult solo, but CatC is much more difficult and I like it.

I have a session report against Nightmare Rhosgobel that I just need to get around to writing up. I tend to like all the Nightmares, and I like the original AJtR, but I wouldn't say this one is a must-buy or must-play, as it doesn't change or add all that much to what was already there, other than making it a tad harder, and it isn't one of the more difficult ones, for that matter.

The tokens are good but is to much of them! Dice is perfect for resources and progress. You can also use different colours dice green for progress and red for wounds. Also when you have a 12 or 15 progress tokens on quest card to calculate it take some time. With dice is only one look is enough. Make game more faster and comfortable.

Nice run through, thanks.  I liked seeing Saruman "fog" the Hunter for a turn.

 

Now maybe I've been playing it wrong, but I thought as you transitioned from Stage 2 to Stage 3 you are still in the quest phase and so you have to draw three cards per stage 3?

 

Also, I'll watch it again, but it appeared that you "flashed" Emory out the first time when you weren't in the planning phase?  You play fast so I probably missed what you did.

Yes the stage 1b force effect is happen before then you move to the next stage 2a. Check the FAQ it is there...

 

Emely have a action : you can play her anytime for free just a discard 3 top cards of your deck. So you can swap her to play any phase as a action. She is really useful.

Totally forgot about her as I hardly ever play mono-spirit. Nice one. Regrading the forced effects, I was thinking they happened on stages 2 and 3, but as you played it, they're on 1&2.

I played this one with a Rohan deck (Theoden, Eomer and Eowyn). Eomer's ability allowed me to kill the Berserker immediatly (sometimes I took the attack undefended). With Steed of the Mark or Rohan Warhorse he gets even better.

Hey Glaurung,

 

I know the two of us have sparred back and forth in the past, and I don't always agree with your comments, but I will say this: I really appreciate the effort you put into your game recordings. I I like watching them. A) You have a knack for coming up with powerful deck strategies, B) It's very fun to watch someone play a game. The game kind of "comes to life" watching it, rather than just playing it myself.

 

Thanks again

Laketown game 2: LOL. Been there done that!

Game 3: Silvan Refugee stood by and watched an Envoy and another character die and she bravely kept questing... Later in the game you correctly removed them from play. At the end of the game you could have quested with Arwen and pumped Elrond's defense and I think he would have lived? (Not that it matters much.)

Anyway, thanks for the videos. I really think your deck would benefit from a Master of the Forge or two, but I'm sure you've considered it.

Yes i miss up with a Silvan Refuge……… Arwen pump him but he has 1 damage i suppose….Still 3 games in a row brain boil.

 

I dont like MOTF but maybe should try….

Always like your videos.  They are usually quite interesting and tense.  If you have the time, a game of Stewards Fear would be cool to see.  That's a cool quest.  I would also enjoy watching a new player deck besides the Elrond deck or Dwarf deck.  But it's up to you.  I will enjoy whatever video you upload.

Thanks for the good feedback! I will make more video and sure Nmode will b there as well. But i must admit Dead marches and Emyn Muil  Nmode solo is really easy. Even in 2 players game those quiets a getting really hard. With every player add diffciclulty ramp at least 50%. 

 

RTM Nmode is impossible solo at the moment as i see it…..maybe there is a way but i still didn find it for now……..

Interesting.   I remember Flight to the Ford deck was very good.  Haven't played it in a very long time though.  Can super-tuned Flight to Ford deck have a chance at it do you think?  Dissipointed to hear DM and EM are still fairly easy solo......  They are awesome quests, just easy.....We need double nightmare mode for those eh?  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]   darn.....

Hmm Flight of the ford was good deck but RTM just a lot of think to handle for 1 deck…… maybe maybe...

 

DM and EM is not easy…..they are getting very hard in 2 players game……. But solo yes i play 3 games of both quest and never was on the edge

NMEM was a pretty good upgrade in my opinion. I played it 3 times today and only won one. In one of the losses I was treated out with a deck that had 3 Elrond's Council, a Galadhrim's Greeting and freaking Strider! The Nightmare deck takes out a lot of the victory point locations so you really have to dig for them. I got stuck with recurring bats and just watched the dial tick up and up... Anyway, it's gone from being a cream puff to a decent test, and when you flip Tunneling Nameless Thing the first time it will certainly give you pause.

First time I played nightmare hills I got Tunneling Nameless Thing first turn which proceeded to eat a hero when it got A Hurrying Darkness as its shadow card giving it +4 attack (Amon Hen/Lhaw was the active location). Had to restart after it ate a second hero the following turn....Very intense first try!

To be honest SOE is not so good as a quest. Spirit key word is cool idea, dusk also but sounds like this quest is really work only 3 or 4  player game. For solo is too easy in my opinion. Monotony......

Ok we play 3 times Into the mines. first quest of KD Nmode. 2 win 1 lost. And both win was on the edge and very long game. We play very good decks Elrond Glor Mirlonde vilya Beorn deck and Eowyn Eomer Imrahil come and go ally deck.  Was really interesting to play this quest. We play about 5 hours 3 times. very cool scenario, i love shadow dweller and counts of your torch life!  Very very good!  

 

Tonight we will play seven level and then Flight from Moria.  Im very exiting to try it!

Ok we play Seven level and make it on the first attempt. Honestly we dont really like it but we play only once….. I mean is ok but the first qurst was more interesting in my opinion.

Then we come to last one FFM. We play 3 times and lost all of them. Very very good quest! Many different things happen all the time. Is difficult and so wide choice of combanation of encounter deck, quest deck and our decks make our brains boiled. We cannot win so we need to try more. Anyway KD Nmode is amazing I cannot wait for next Nmode expansion

Journey down to Anduin one of the best quest in the game. Normal mode and Nightmare as well!

NM 7th level one of my favorite quests now, the original was always one of my favorites too. I always test my new decks on this one now.

I have similar deck with same 3 heroes although I never try Frodo though. I like to have 2 Copies of Faramir in the deck, he is perfect late game when there are a lot of allies in play. He is exactly what you needed on game 3

Using a chump blocking strategy for this quest is very difficult that shadow card is a game ender like in your first 2 games. Were you running hasty stroke?

I also like Westfold outrider for this scenario to pull goblin archer out of staging area. I opted for him over windlord. His consistent 2 attack is pretty useful too I also liked Rohan Warhorse in the deck for swarms of enemies like in 7th level, personally i think it's a better choice then BoG. I would also have the horse breeder to fetch those mounts earlier, and her 1 Wp can help with questing.

The scenario is not too difficult with the right deck, but the deck your using make the scenario much harder. My similar deck struggled on it too.

Yes you right about it. I just play on a spot as is going without preparation. Actually I dont like to change deck from quest to quest. I like idea one rule them all! I try to use Frodo to avoid hasty stroke but… . it was not enough will power for questing. Anyway was fun!

Thanks for the videos Glaurung. Just one thing: I think (I could be mistaken) at some point before you go in phase 2, you play 2 Foehammer cards while only having one weapon in play. Tbh I dont remember if Imrahil also had a blade of gondolin but I do t think he did.

Glad I'm not the only one.  My observation for Seventh Level NM was that there were a few key encounter cards that, if you couldn't answer them, you lost.  Your deck might have the answer, but your hand might not.

But you can have only 1 weapon to play up to 3 events. Events play in  response so you can tap a sword play one event and then in response play second. Even you can play first event draw 3 cards and if you get same event among those 3 cards you still able to play it in response and draw another 3 cards. only one weapon is enough.

> Glad I'm not the only one.  My observation for Seventh Level NM was that there were a few key encounter cards that, if you couldn't answer them, you lost.  Your deck might have the answer, but your hand might not.

 

Yes you absolutely right about it. I can make a better deck special against this quest but this time i just play a deck try to win.

However  i manage to win with same deck couple of times so there was a chance...... Cheers!

Wow that's not how i have played it at all. The response calls for exhausting the weapon. Once the weapon is exhausted for the first response then how can another copy of Foe hammer be played using the same weapon, the weapon has already been exhausted?

This. Each copy of Foe-Hammer has the additional cost of exhausting a weapon. You do it once, you pay the cost once. For each copy you play you must pay the full cost, which includes exhausting the weapon.

Glaurung, i have not watched whole video, i had to stop becuse i think you are playing bifur wrong.

His action: pay 1 resource from a hero's resource pool to add 1 to Bifur's resource pool.

Only Bifur can be given a resource. He can not give a resource to another hero. In the first planning phase you give bifur's resource to Hurlin to play SoG. That's going to have a signifigant impact on the rest of the game because of the early resource acceleration.

Anyway, let me know if I'm missing something about Bifur or something else.

## 107 [MyNeighbourTrololo on October 14, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85635-glaurung-play-through-youtube-channel/?do=findComment&comment=1299044)

Yeah. Maximum what you can do with this is pay 1 resource from Bifur's resource pool to add 1 resource to Bifur's resource pool. That's why I usually take Bifur into the Lore-Something decks as the only lore hero - he can turn any resource into the green one. That's why I'll build a Gandalf-Bifur-somebody deck once my Road Darkens arrives.

Of course, Glaurung, take your time, several days or whatever you consider. Making videos is always for entertainment, not for obligation :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png].

 

It's so easy to make mistakes in a game with so many variables in play (even more in NM mode) that tracking all the things + being tired + making a gameplay video, trying to entertain = make some errors.

 

But it's ok for me, and I am sure that other people. One of the things that I love most is watching you mainly (and other players too) play some of the most difficult quests. Or even easy ones.

 

So I hope you don't stop making videos forever! It'd be kind of a let down :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png] .

Glaurung please do not worry. It must be hard playing with a little daughter and trying to play when tired. No apologies please your videos are easily the best playthroughs I have seen and I am always amazed at how you can play solo and still win.

Thanks for doing so much just to make video's for us when you already have a quite busy life.  I'm obviously too lazy to make videos myself.  Take your time man.  I'll enjoy whatever videos you make.  I'm quite busy myself; I haven't played for a very long time.  Its actually makes the game more fun when you don't play it for a while I think.....

Thanks Khamul. I try always to make my games really tension and really full of different  difficult decision...... Nightmare RTM is really tough one so is always big battle there......

When i get Hill Troll + Atercoop, shadow efect Gobiln rider then rise threat by 8 wow it was ouch! and is only 1 combat phase.

To be honest, I'm on a totally different page than you.  I don't think its that hard.  Not anymore at least.  I think it needed a new coat of paint just as much as any other quest.  I find it rather odd that most of the quests that people think are so extremely hard are not that bad to me.  huh.  Different play styles I guess.

Why I dont like new cycle?

Boring difficult. After briliant nighmare quest is very boring to play standard quest. Actually I dont play standard quest except some really difficulty ones as third cycle quests for example.

I built up Glaurung's deck and came up with 51 cards. Since I really doubted he was playing with 51 I went back and watched the first part of the video a bunch of times and I'm pretty sure he only has TWO copies of Nenya in the deck - which makes perfect sense since the deck doesn't really need it.  (I know he says three.)

 

I've played Silvan's before and the only big difference is that Glaurung adds a couple of non-theme power cards in Steward of Gondor and Light of Valinor (which are obviously powerful additions).  And of course his staple "A Very Good Tale".  (If anybody wants it I can post the 50.)  I completely agree with leaving out the Silvan Refugee's.  They screw up the deck harmony.

 

So I tried it against Steward's Fear (non-nightmare) and got torched a couple of times by Zealous Traitor (1damage to each ally).  I hate that guy.

 

Love to see your videos G.

Yes Zealot traitor bad boy since most of silvan allies have 1 hit point.

You should keep Gandalf Sneak attack in hand and kill them in staiging area.

By the way I do like a Legolas a lot but im doubt you can make a strong enough silvan tactick deck for solo play.

Someone have any? I mean only for solo play.

I was able to use Sneak Attack Gandalf for the first one, but the second came on the next turn.  I was able to rebuild most of my board by cycling Orophim in and out and pulling the Handmaidens out of the yard.

 

I used Rumil like you did - twice discarding him to Daeron's Runes*.  I really don't think he belongs in the deck.  And I don't think Legolas does either - too much work to get him into play in this deck and he would break up the sequencing and symmetry.

 

*Another Orophim cycle.

Well, in my Silvan deck I have no problem playing Rumil or Galadhon Archers because I use Elrond instead of Haldir, and ofc Steward goes on Elrond. I don't have Legolas ally yet, and didn't proxied it (because I don't use sleeves at all), but I think he'll fit just fine.

I've played with Silvan's before so I knew what to expect.  Your build is a bit more spiky with Steward and Tale, but not much.  I played against Steward's Fear three times and lost twice.  The first loss came when two Traitor's came out as Hidden cards and wrathed my board.  The second when the plot was Up in Flames.  I ended up decking myself because I had drawn so many cards before that point.  On the other hand I also played Into Ithilien twice and just simply cruised to victories.  These were non-nightmare games.  For whatever reason I really like playing the Elrond/Mirlond/Glory deck better than this one.

 

I'm going to sleeve up the nightmare versions next and give them a go.  Strangely I have nightmare Heirs now, but not the second half of Dwarrowdelf.  My LGS is great at getting the normal releases very early, but PODs take forever.

I don't want to spoil anything, but wow.

Ok... I will spoil one thing. I was hoping to see you use your silvan deck there. Nice deck though.

Strong play, though not your best deck I think.

Not sure, but I think you missed one damage on Celador as the refugee left the table in the early rounds. And looking at the table at the end, that might have turn the win into a loss.

Love your videos, please continue. You really have a very neat analyse of the game, and you nearly never make a wrong play. You are a very strong player.

May I suggest going to Flies and spiders Nightmare with Beorn/Glorfindel/Frodo

Beorn and Frodo's ability preventing them from taking poison. Then good meal + fortune or fate to "refresh" Beorn and Galadrim's Greetings and massive threat reduction in order to play Gandalf II (the sticky Gandalf). If you want, I can suggest you a complete decklist.

Yes I do play this kind of deck couple of years ago. Was fun!

There is fun to make certain deck to win certain quest but is not my way. I like to build up current metagame deck which can chance in any quest. Thanks for advise

Glad you like my videos thank you.

I still didn get TOS but even if I have it I will not play it until nightmare cards come out. To easy and boring in standard mode for me…

I still don't play Road to Darkest waiting for Nightmare cards first

I personally don't think you can draw a connection between tragic and Glaurung.  I have seen some of the formers videos, and no offence, but they weren't really that good.  his card reviews are ok, but I much prefer cotr.  They are a lot more, open minded I guess.  I find glaurung to be much more unique and have created many decks thanks to his good Ideas.  Keep up the good work Glaurung!

Do you ever play 2 player/2 handed? Honestly I believe most NM quests are a lot harder when you don't play solo. Having the encounter deck revealing 2 cards a turn instead of 1 allows a lot more combos to occur. I only say this because you often say the game is too easy, and I think if you play 2 handed you'll have a lot more difficulty.

It's actually videos by Tragic that brought me to the game, so... Thanks for sharing your thoughts!

Ok, so Glaurung, what happened to the first quest in OHaUH?  you said you didn't get the treasures?  did you win, or was it not interesting enough to be a video or have you not loaded it up yet?  I personally never play that quest because I have played it SO many times to get the treasures with different heroes.  Again, really enjoy your videos! also, are you going to do the second hobbit?  battle of five armies can get pretty tough, but i guess not so much with one player.

Thanks for the videos, I really enjoy watching them. Gandalf's Pipe now... It allows you to exchange a card in your hand with the top card of your deck and so if you don't have a deck I think it can't be used. Just nit picking.

Yes sounds like this but…. Many cards games I play abd there is a lot of variations about same rules. In this case Riddle quest become really fiddle in solo. Anyway probably you right….

Hey lets do something new and different :

What about to make that way…

Next step of campaign is 3 quests from second Hobbit box. Nightmare mode.

So maybe someone can siggest me a deck and herors to play? Now by the campign rules can change all heroes for free. Between boxes.

Any suggestions?

Troll around? Not agreeing with somebody is considered "trolling" nowdays? Elaborating: dwarves are extremely overused, three heroes in question are from the hobbit saga and most of the hobbit saga's were played exactly with these heroes, which makes the suggested combo twice or even 4th times as overused and boring.

Instead of being all smartass, your last post would have been sufficient. And yes, I am elected to speek for the entire forum, as the eentire forum here hates negative people.

Everybody has his own opinion and is entitled to his own. You may find that deck list boring, but that's no opinion, just a rude statemrnt. Your last post contains an opinion and we all respect that.

Just keep it cool and comfortable for everybody.

Well, if you indeed was elected to "speek for the eentire forum", do your best and learn to write properly first. And, just for the record, there was no negativity until you attacked me.

 

Calling his suggestion "boring" is the same thing as calling a black cat "black". You took offense and attacked me - thats whats rude and negative here. 

 

I am cool, but your outburst here is not.

Talking about being 'attacked'.. All I said was that this forum and this community like to keep posts positive and with positive feedback. This being the internet, not everybody interprets things the same way, certainly not non-native speakers. To elaborate as you did later on is way better. Instead of focusing on the 'negative' I said you did, you could've been the better guy.

Critisizing people for their writing on a universal forum doesn't make any sense either. Take a look at Glaurung himself or mndela. We're not here for a lesson English, but to talk about LotR and this card game. (I am also typing on my phone, so any errors in my typing may occur because of that)

I was appreciating other posts you made, so this did suprise me. If you felt offended, that wasn't the purpose. I just wanted to make you aware of the things I said above.

Anyway, let's leave it be. Sorry for messing up this thread. Sorry if I came over harsh John, it's easy to become angry over the internet.

I would like to see a mono Leadership deck Glaurung. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I don't know, I think that Galadriel finally replaces him for NM. I don't play solo too much, (mostly 2 handed) but I never use Glorfindel and I always play NM. Galdriel fills that crucial, spirit high questing need + she gives you threat reduction and card draw. Glorfindel has been permanently sidelined for me.

As always, thanks for the videos. In the first game, when Glorifindel died I believe you had A Test of Will in hand along with A Good Harvest and one resource on Hama. So I think you could have saved Glory there. It was going to be a tough go anyway though.

In the second game at about 24 minutes, you used A Test of Will to cancel the when revealed effect of a Quest card. (At least I think so, you play fast!). Anyway, that is explicitly prohibited.

Now, about a minute later you use A Good Harvest again to play out Eagles of the Misty Mountains. I'm not so sure about this one: A Good Harvest reads, "Name a sphere. Until the end of the phase, you can spend resources of any sphere when paying for cards that belong to the named sphere." The thing is, Gandalf's resources are neutral and "don't belong to a sphere" according to a previous ruling, so I don't think you can use Gandalf's resources with A Good Harvest. I'm really unsure about this one though. What do other players think?

I don't think you would be able to play a good harvest in that case as I don't believe you can trigger actions during staging until just before quest resolution so you would need to play good harvest whilst you commit characters earlier in the quest phase as you can play the response effect on Test of Will when the treachery is revealed but cannot use the action on A Good Harvest when it is revealed.
Definitely can't cancel the effects of a side quest.

As far as the Gandalf issue that is a curious one but A Good Harvest does indeed read "of any sphere" and neutral is very specifically not a sphere (Sword-Thain for example reads "belonging to any sphere" and cannot be played on neutral unique allies because of this) so pretty sure you are correct and you would indeed not be able to use Gandalf's resources in this way.

I think you are on the money Bullroarer.

 

This is pretty interesting as I actually just listened to an old Grey Company podcast that discusses a comment Glaurung made on one of their videos about their "responsibility" to not make mistakes (as community leaders/podcast creators for the game). Seems as though Glaurung himself is just as likely to make mistakes as they are, that are just as quickly picked up by community members. It is a complex game for sure and no one is immune to making mistakes on occasion. I have to say I agree with what was said in the podcast in that playing with actual physical cards (as opposed to OCTGN) is better in this particular regard in that you can more easily spot or avoid mistakes with the cards right there in front of you. I personally have a laminated copy of the kaybee quick reference guide (http://www.kaybee.org/kirk/LoTR_LCG_QuickRef.pdf [http://www.kaybee.org/kirk/LoTR_LCG_QuickRef.pdf]) that I have next to me during every game as a quick reference to avoid mistakes whenever possible. No offense intended to Glaurung but the fact he plays with physical cards (not to mention his feelings about nightmare and constant declaration that the game is too easy/not worth playing without nightmare cards) he kind of has less excuse than they do in regards to making mistakes.

Honestly I think there are probably a small handful of players on the forums that are real sticklers for rules and play every game very slowly and carefully and make almost no mistakes but the vast majority of us are prone to making mistakes on occasion especially when playing new quests or quests we have not played many times before, or when we are under time constraints (which for sure both Glaurung with his young daughter and job and the Grey company guys with their busy lives often have) or even just when playing quests with a more complex and shifting board state (Antlered Crown, Dunland Trap etc). I think that occasional mistakes is something that needs to just be accepted with this game especially when they are made by people like the Grey Company guys or Glaurung considering the vast wealth of knowledge we know that they have of the game and the amazing resources they provide us with like their videos or podcasts or events.

Yes you right. I do a lot of Mistakes now. First couse I stop to play lotr as much as before… second now with a new quest and Nightmare mode there is lot of thing to track. So game become more difficult but same time I play less now so there is a mistakes coming. However only a last video have a many mistakes couse as I said begore I dont play much now and my grasp of the game is weak now. Day night objective also bring sone new twist.

I will definitely try play more careful from now.

Thank you for feedback and support!

You are right.  That wouldn't work because there is no window to play actions, only responses.

 

For my part I wasn't trying to stir up divisiveness.  This is a tough game.  Playing solo you are already keeping track of two decks and if you play two handed you are keeping track of three.  And that doesn't even include interactions.  I try not to make mistakes when I play, but of course I do.  It drives me crazy to think I won a close game and then realize later I erred in a rule.

And remember that you cannot make progress on the quest during Night. It's a tough one both in terms of remembering everything and also beating the quest :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Nice second video! I really like this quest.

Ultra-nitpicks: You use a Gandalf resource with A Good Harvest to help pay for Asfaloth out of your hand, which as mentioned earlier in the thread isn't allowed. But you have more than enough Tactics resources, so you could've easily used one of those. Similarly, you forget to pay for Feint at around the 24-minute mark, but again you have plenty of Tactics resources, so it doesn't impact the game either. No need for a 3rd video. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Yes sure why not? Some normal mode quest a quite cool. Wastes of Eriadoe or Deadman pikes for example!

I love DP, really cool one!

Sounds like I miss something… Gandalf resources cannot be with a Good Harvest effect? Why?

I think PsychoRocka (and Bullroarer Took before him) said it well earlier... 'As far as the Gandalf issue that is a curious one but A Good Harvest does indeed read "of any sphere" and neutral is very specifically not a sphere (Sword-Thain for example reads "belonging to any sphere" and cannot be played on neutral unique allies because of this) so pretty sure you are correct and you would indeed not be able to use Gandalf's resources in this way.'

 

I've played this wrong a bunch of times myself.

Cool move at the beginning - did anyone check whether Glaurung's  interpretation of the rules is correct and Prince Imrahil actually becomes a hero when he is still in someones hand and that you can play him for free? In the rule book it says "hero cards cannot move to a player’s hand or deck." however, it doesn't say they cannot "be" in someones hand..

Would that work similarly when he is in the discard? I believe in one of Beorns posts, he describes returning Imrahil as an ally card from the discard...

It doesn't work, for the simple reason that the game text on cards is not active unless they are in play. So Imrahil remains an ally as long as he is in your hand or discard pile.

That's how I would have interpreted it I guess...
