Is it possible to make it with a basic deck? I tried with intellect, and it's impossible to take down that Hill Troll. What do you guys recommend? Do I create my own deck for this quest? just try another basic deck? Because even so I see it so invincible. I got the first 2 expansion. Do I use cards from there?

 

thanks :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

It's definitely possible. try combining the Spirit sphere with one of the others. the most important thing is to keep your starting threat low enough that you aren't immediately attacked by the Hill Troll.

That's the way to go. The preconstructed sphere decks will win Anduin only through dumb luck. The adventure requires you to build your own deck and think about your strategy. If you choose wisely Anduin is beatable. It gets even more easy if you include some extra cards from the expansion but this is no must for beating it.

 Agreed with everyone else.  You can definitely beat this scenario solo (I have many times)...keeping starting threat low is key to buy you a few turns to avoid the Troll, then, hope you draw a forest snare (I usually play lore against this quest), or a Gandalf or two. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] The most success I had beating this quest early on was starting with Gloin, Eowyn, and Beravor. Good luck!

I can so feel you pain :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] I wanna beat all the quests solo in the order they are produced so I've been stuck with the Anduin for about 2 months...playing a few games a week, so not consistently everyday ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] and I can't count the times I've lost. Today I finally decided to give in and try what people have suggested me to do. Go through it with a mono spirit deck. And I actually finally beat it! solo with this mono spirit 30 cards deck. I found Dunhere great and to my surprise also Elenor. So she had gotten a golden star in my book :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] I had 3x Gandalf in the deck and took out the 2 Power in the Earth cards. First game with this setting I lost, second I won. And it was a great feeling. So don't give up :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
