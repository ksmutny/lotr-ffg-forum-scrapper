quick strike.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         action:exhaust a character you control to immediately declare it as an attacker (and resolve its attack) against any eligible enemy target.                                     can i use this card to use my ranged character to attack an enemy in the staging area? or is that specifically for hands upon the bow?

no- ranged is not eligible to attack in the staging area at any point -only with enemies engaged with other player

you can only ever attack in staging through specific effects such as dunhere, hands upon the bow and yew bow

I´m assuming that this is implied but ranged characters are also eligible to attack enemies engaged with yourself. Not "only enemies engaged with other player" animado [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_scripts/ckeditor/plugins/smiley/images/animar.gif]
