Ok, hear me out guys.  I've been playing a bit with the (relatively) new Dori in this dwarf deck I made (Dori/Gimli/Gloin).    This is a multiplayer deck, which is why Dori caught my eye.   He's got Sentinel. 
 

So I started using him, and I'm not saying he's the next Glorfindel,  but he's not nearly as bad as most of us originally made him out to be.  

For 10 threat I slotted him in, his stats are pretty good.  5 HP is his main benefit, he can take a lot of punishment for only being 10 threat, and with Ring Mail he quickly becomes 3def 6 hp Sentinel.  

Furthermore, that ability comes in handy more than you might think in multiplayer.   Giving an extra 2-3 def to a hero turns out to be pretty useful.   Now I know your probably thinking "yeah, but why would you spend 2 heroes to block when you could just sentinel with him instead"   well, because a lot of the time it's a matter of Dori otherwise doing nothing.  I don't defend much with said deck, I take a lot of hits right in the Gloin.  So Dori is available to either block if I have to, sentinel or buff up another defender.  Or attack, if need be.

I don't think he's terrible, just not as obviously useful as some. Not being able to defend an attack with more than one character can be awkward with some of the heavier hitting enemies these days, and dori essentially lets you. Sometimes you don't want to chump block, or risk a hero being killed, so being able to throw extra defence to a hero where needed is potentially useful.

Probably best in 3-4 player game, I would think.

haha.  Okay, well I maybe could have put it better.  Let me make the point a little clearer cut.

Originally I had Thalin in the deck.  Dori is way better than Thalin.

I would question that assertion. Of course partly it's contextual - if you don't have so many good defenders available but attack is fine, then sure, a potential defence boost is going to be more useful than spreading direct damage around. But if you can defend adequately, then I come back to the "a lot of the time it's a matter of Dori otherwise doing nothing." I think we can be pretty sure that if you still had Thalin, he would be consistently doing something.

 

I would certainly agree that Dori is not as bad as some people have said he is. But would it really be game-breaking if his ability either a) could be applied as a response after a shadow was revealed, b) could be applied to allies as well as heroes, or c) applied the bonus until the end of the phase instead of just for one attack? Maybe all three of those at once would be a bit much, but one or two of them I think would still be fine, and make him much more usable.

I think Dori is meant to combo with cards like stand your ground and hour of wrath. I just agree that it's just not good enough. Maybe he is better than Thalin and you MUST have a red dwarf, but other than that very narrow situation I would use almost any other hero instead.

Dori is pretty terrible. There's not many heroes worse than he is. Consider that he has to exhaust when defenders are declared, meaning you either need readying effects or he doesn't quest. Then, essentially all you're getting for Hero-level stats (not to mention the valuable slot) is a +2 defense boost - which can be accomplished through many other more useful and cheaper means. Durin's Song, Ring Mail, the ever-amazing Arwen. Unless you're super squeezed for deck space, it's almost always worth it to include some of those cards instead of wasting a hero on the off-chance you find yourself defending with a hero you didn't want to and in need of a lifesaving boost.

Dori is not terrible. But nowdays, when we are looking for heroes to add to our decks, we're aiming for stuff that is not just "not terrible", but usually way above that level.

Personally I've always thought of Caldara as a terrible hero. But plenty of people use her. Different people see different value in cards. Isn't that the point of a game like this?

Not in this case. Caldara was a diamond in a rough. This one here has nothing valuable about it, just a piece of regular rock.

I think the fact people can consistently beat nightmare quests with Caldara decks proves her to be empirically not terrible. It's not a matter of perspective, she clearly brings something to the table which really helps, so long as you make the deck work around her. I would love for someone to prove that Dori isn't terrible in a similar manner, but unless his ability gets errata'd to be a bit more useful or he gets seriously bolstered by other cards being released I don't hold out that much hope for it.

My first victim of Dori: Daechanar, defending him (when no chump blockers were ready) with Erk (+dunedain warning) + Dori (readying them with Hold your Ground). Daechaner attacked up to 6 (cause of 2 sorceries were in play). Who will be the next? Let's see!!! ^^.

Honestly I don't find Dori particularly inspiring either, but I don't share the overwhelming opinion on these boards that's he's a coaster, as I said in my first reply to this thread.

My point was that I thought Caldara was poor, and other people saw a use. I'm still not overwhelmed by Caldara decks as a concept, but they work. Just because you don't see potential, doesn't mean someone else won't. How many people looked at Love of Tales and filed it as chaff?

So Dori + elledan + elhrohir.

Straight away Elrohir can defend for 5 multiple times, no cards required.

 

Obviously any quest with a smaller number of large enemies would benefit from this, pity it can't go onto the Beorn hero.

 

If you unexpected courage can you add Dories defense twice?

 

Boromir tactics hero could use the +2 defense multiple times.

 

So there are ways of using him if you build for it.  Its all very nice saying that you can use Durin's Song, Ring Mail, the ever-amazing Arwen etc, but you need to have a deck with that sphere, and draw the card, and have the resources to play it.

 

Definitely be a better hero in multiplayer, but you can say that for any with ranged or sentinel.

Caldara + Arwen hero + sword thain gives you 3 allies for the sacking of caldera.  Arwen helps bin cards and get the extra resources.

Bring out Pelargir Shipwright's who quest for 4 :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]. Emery and bilbo as cheap unique allies.

Nope. Dori gives +2 def for single attack, not until the end of the phase.

Yeah nothing you mentioned here works since Dori's effect is only for a single attack. It's also a response, so you can't use UC you ready him and stack his ability for a big attack.

 

Despite this, there are niche uses... like Dori+Beregond+Gondorian shield lets you take huge hits from Smaug in Battle for Lake Town on turn 1 and can really shine there. But as for a hero you would take up against an ordinary quest? I think not. Even if you are successful, you haven't proven that he's better than pretty much any other hero you could have brought.

I have Dori in my Gimli-Dori-Oin deck (whose companion is a classic Dain-Thorin-Ori deck).

 

He's the defender, but he's just a tactics dwarf body who fills that roll better than Thalin would.  Beregond would do a better job, but it's a thematic deck.  I got to use his ability one time over the course of a Three Trials game this evening, saving Dain from what would have been 2 points of damage.  Any other ability would have been more useful here -- actually it would have been nice to have Beregond's ability on this guy, so you don't have to pay for Ring Mail or you could put a Citadel Plate on him for a reasonable price.  Ah, well.

bugger I guess I need to read things better, to only one attack makes Dori a lot worse than my original thoughts then.

I think the key is you can boost defense straight away, with no cards or resources.

His 5 HP allows him to block small enemies without to much danger.

 

Dori + Expected Courage + any defense boosts might be a more efficient way to increase multiple hero's defense, with only one shield, or armour or protector of Lorien.  Definitely much better for multiplayer.

Useful for quests where those annoying enemies auto engage the last player or other such things that bypass threat, you can boost one of the other players hero's.

 

But yes reading the card properly shows his boost only affects one attack, this definitely devalues the card.

 

This might also provide a way for the Hero Gloin to be useful now, he used to be able to just absorb an attack, but now all of the enemies are to strong.  And if you have a week enemy don't use Dori.

Might also allow Gimili to get powered up/raged without getting dead.

 

Would probably work well with the Erkenbrand hero

 

 

The other  thing that comes to mind is what to do if you don't need his ability, how to get some benefit out of him not being tapped / not questing.  A quick look gives "Ancestral Knowledge", "We are not idle", "spare hood and cloak", "common cause" , Put dark Knowledge on him as you won't quest.

 

5 HP makes him a good song of mocking target, this will give him the same ability as his ally version.  Use raven winged helm as well.... (I mightt have to make a Dori the sponge deck up)

 

 

So lots of options, probably won't be top tier decks, or just easy auto includes but could still have some fun.  So not terrible, but compared to most of the new Heros, definitely sub par.

So, funny story, I had always pronounced that character's name in two syllables, with a long "O" sound,  a result that sounds rather like "GLOW-in".   And then I heard someone else -I think maybe on CBotR podcast- pronounce it Gloin -rhyming with "coin".  And another word that I also obviously  thought of.   Considering that taking hits is sort of what Gloin does and it seemed a very appropriate pun, I switched over.   Still...  I'm still not sure which one is correct.

Anyway, back to the issue at hand, I encourage all the skeptics to build a deck, give him a good solid try in multiplayer, and if you still think he's 3rd place amongst Dwarf Tactics heroes... well hey, agree to disagree.   But to me he's much better in reality than in theory-deckbuilding.

I'm pretty sure Glow-in is the correct pronunciation, but I find it hard to switch because I've been saying it the wrong way for so long (also that's the way it's pronounced in the movies).

Nah, it's Gloin as in coin.

With Dain on the other hand, I learned a year ago or so that the cd book narrator said it like the german word "dein".

I use the german word for lack of a better example in english, but just use the y from "my" in there.

And that was different from how the movies (or anybody I know) pronounced it.

I tend to agree. Often times a card that will not have a lot of value will see a complimentary card long after it's initial release. To use Caldara as an example, she certainly wasn't as panned as Dori. There were some who advocated for her and stated that though she wasn't terrible, there was something in that strategy and it just needed a few more key pieces to really shine. Boom, we have Sword-Thain and now she's even better and all I hear now are Caldara Decks doing quite well.

 

Now Dori is more panned than Caldara and right now there isn't a select few gathering around to defend this Tactics Dwarf Hero with a lower-tier deck that just needs a few pieces. It would need a lot of work. But who's to say that the designers can't come up with a card that immediately boosts his worth. I'm just making word vomit at this point but here's an off the cuff card that will probably never be made:

"Helm of Durin, 2 Cost Tactics Attachment

Attach to a Dwarf Hero, restricted.

Combat Action: After a Dwarf Hero exhausts during the combat phase ready that Hero. It gets +2 Defense until the end of the phase."

 

Suddenly Dori isn't so bad. So in a vacuum yeah he's not that pretty. But you never know what card will come out that changes things.

There are some heroes that his ability is like to be safe for a card at first hand. For example Bilbo would be Gleowine. Haldir would be quickstrike...

 

Well Dori is overpowered because he would represent 2 cards so!!! Gondor Shield, and Stand Together

The very fact that something is repeatable makes it more valuable than a one-time effect, though.

Not if you have to exhaust a hero for an effect like this.

Dori should read:

RESPONSE: After A hero is declared as an Defender add Dori's defense to the defending hero's defense for this attack. Limit once per turn.

 

Dori is not good because you have to exhaust a 10Threat hero for a meager effect. Just think of Beravor or Eleanor. These effects are worth exhausting a hero.

Not to mention Eleanor has vastly lower threat (plus a way better abillity).

## 45 [JonofPDX on January 20, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/199340-so-dori-hes-not-terrible/?do=findComment&comment=2003020)

So, let’s clear something up right now. Dori isn’t unplayable. He isn’t terrible. He isn’t even bad. I mean—really check him out. He’s a 10-threat Hero sitting at 2/3/2/5 with Sentinel (assuming someone’s running Dain—which you are if you’re trying to find reasons to run Dori). Those are good stats. And that’s before you take into account the fact that he’s a target for the various Dwarf events and attachments. And he’s a Tactics dwarf, which you can’t ignore considering your other options are pretty limited (I love Gimli but Thalin is a Hero you have to build around to make him effective). Plus, even forgetting about his ability, he has Sentinel, which is okay in 2-player, good in 3-player and fantastic in 4-player. And while this is an admittedly small thing—that art.

 

He’s not bad.

 

But…that ability. That ability is bad. For a number of reasons. Exhaust a 10-threat cost hero (with a base 1/2/2 but really 2/3/2 stat line) to add 2 (maybe 3, if you got a Ring Mail on him) to another defending characters defense. For that one attack. And only if the defending character was a hero. And before shadow effects are revealed. And—this is the kicker—on a hero that already has Sentinel and could have just blocked on the other side of the board.

 

So no, Dori isn’t a bad character. Not even really a bad Hero. But unless you’re in a 4-player game playing against a combat-heavy encounter deck and need a Tactics resource on a Dwarf-traited character in your hero-lineup (something that, post Erebor Battle Master’s errata, is less important) then the opportunity cost for playing him vs so many other heroes is just too much. And even if you play him…how often are you going to want to use his ability vs just using the Sentinel?

 

That’s why Dori’s a disappointment. Not because he’s terrible. But because, unlike other mediocre-on-the-surface heroes like Rossiel and Caldara, there’s no way to build around his ability to make it more than it appears. At least, not one anyone has figured out yet with the current cardpool.

 

For me, he reminds me of Mirlonde. She’s fine. Her stats are decent and she can key off some Silvan synergy. But the designers were so focuses on not making her over-powered (and pushing mono-sphere decks to the exclusion of everything else) that they made her lack-luster. But at least Mirlonde is dirt-cheap in the right deck—Dori is still 10 threat. 

 

EDIT:

 

One thing worth noting that I forgot to mention. In a muti-player game where you have Dain on the board, you are going to want to have as many dwarves as possible across the players. Someone running this Dori means your Lore player can't run the (really pretty good) Dori ally.

He should get an Errata like ...

 

"Response: After another Dwarf-Hero is declared as a defender and Dori is ready, add Dori's DEF to the defending hero's DEF for this attack. (Limit once per round.)"

 

Then Dori would be great.

Here lies Dori. He wasn't terrible.

## 50 [dalestephenson on January 21, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/199340-so-dori-hes-not-terrible/?do=findComment&comment=2004445)

Repeating my comments from the "Cards we want to see" thread, I think what we need is a card that turns Dori's ability from being useful in rare corner cases to being more generally useful.  (I see no chance of positive errata, unfortunately.  Has there ever been errata in this game to make a weak card stronger?)

 

What I want is something that helps out Dori a lot, but doesn't have to be used with Dori.  And that means synergy with his rarely-useful ability.

 

So his ability

1) Exhausts after defender is declared

2) Adds his defense to another hero's defense for one attack.

 

The edge case where this ability is useful is where you don't need Dori's attack or defense for anything, but you need to buff a hero defender to take some massive attack (or another player's hero when Dori's player has no enemies).  I see two angles:

 

1) Get rid of the exhaust cost somehow.  Without the exhaust, Dori can buff a defending hero and still attack (making him solo-friendly), or potential buff multiple hero defenders in a multiplayer context.

2) Give some extra benefit for adding defense.

 

For #1, something like this would really help Dori

Tactics 1 attachment -- Unexpected Valor.  When a Hero exhausts not to quest, defend, or attack, exhaust unexpected valor to ready him.

 

This makes Dori useful even in solo, and the attachment is in-sphere.  It's also extremely useful for other heroes with an exhaust ability (Beravor, Denethor, Elanor, Haldir, Galadriel, Merry), but most of the other heroes have once per round limitations and only Dori has the attachment in-sphere.  The attachment would also be handy for attachments that exhaust themselves and the hero, but again that's not repeatable and only in-sphere for Great Yew Bow.

 

For #2, something like this would be useful

Tactics event (cost 1?) -- Counter-stroke.  After a hero defends without taking damage, do damage to enemy equal to the hero's attack.

 

With that, Dori's loss of action advantage can be worth it, because by buffing the defense of a good *attacking* hero he can potentially enable substantial direct damage.  Suddenly Dori becomes useful in a Gimli deck, serving as a defender most of the time but enabling the occasional massive counter stroke.  But it's also a card that doesn't require Dori to be in play to be handy in a deck.  (Maybe it should be "after a character defends", though?)

I think you’re right. I don’t remember any player card ever receiving positive errata. And I would love to see something come out to make his ability more useful.

 

As for your suggestions, I would love to see something like that ready effect but I would prefer it to be neutral at a higher cost. 1 is a little OP but in tactics I can’t think of anyone else it helps but this guy. 

## 52 [Authraw on January 21, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/199340-so-dori-hes-not-terrible/?do=findComment&comment=2004935)

Here's a bold assertion: the only reason we think Dori is terrible is because Beregond exists. If it weren't for Beregond, Dori would be the cheapest way to get sentinel in tactics (your only other choice being Théoden). He's also a way to easily get to 4-6 defense without requiring too many attachments -- a great option for quests where the players have to weather many attacks of 5-8 (so the HoN+AtS cycle, or any quest with a troll or dragon in it).

The problem is that Beregond solves these problems more efficiently: with a single (free) attachment he defends for 6 on turn 1. Anywhere you might consider using Dori, Beregond is going to do the job better. The only thing Dori has on Beregond is that Dori is a dwarf, but once "tactics dwarf" is your criterion then the more generally applicable Gimli starts to look more attractive...

He came too late to be useful without a support card. He probably would have seen some play back in the Khazad Dum days, but in the modern card pool he's just a little too niche.

For what it's worth, my friends and I used Dori in a 3-player romp taking dwarf decks through Ruins of Belegost, and he was pretty useful. With just a single Ring Mail attached, he could combine forces with Bombur, Dain, or Gandalf to safely tank hits from the dragon without losing a hero. Stand Your Ground readied him up (along with Gimli ally, Gandalf, and Dwalin ally) to do it again. So he's not terrible, he's just not Beregond.

I just thought of small modification to Dori that would make him look much more attractive (at lieast to me) (not in a weird way, you know):

 

Response: After another hero is declared as a defender, exhaust Dori to add his [Defense] to the defending hero’s [Defense] for this attack. If this hero takes no damage during that attack, ready Dori. (Limit once per round.)

 

That, or maybe reversal - ready him if the defending hero takes damage. I dunno.

Having the ready attachment be 2-cost and neutral would make it more generally useful to other exhausting heroes, but less Dori-friendly.  Dori's exhausting ability is least useful, so having it be a 1-cost tactic attachment allows you to buff Dori cheaply, but doesn't allow buffing the better exhausting heroes without including tactics.

 

It is true that (so far) it would only benefit Dori in tactics, though if it said "character" instead of "hero" it would work on Bofur and Honour Guard.  It would also allow use with tactics events Hail of Stones and Rain of Arrows, but I doubt you'd use the attachment just for those purposes.

 

Repeatable attachments that would be benefit from "Unexpected Valor":

 

Elrond/Vilya

Galadriel/Nenya

Palantir (neutral)

Ranger Bow (lore)

Palantir of Orthanc/Aragorn

 

There is one attachment already that is already Dori-friendly, in the defend-and-don't take damage case, in The Day's Rising, +1 resource for defending without damage).  It's leadership and requires a sentinel hero, so the obvious candidates for buffing would be Aragorn (starts 4 defense with Dori) and Erkenbrand (starts 5 defense with Dori, can cancel shadows for 1 damage but I think that'd stop the resource gain).  The other sentinel heroes (besides Dori) are Lore Aragorn, Theoden (tactics/spirit), and Beregond, so if you've got enough players to need a defender *somewhere* you could Dori as needed to make this attachment pay every turn.

I actually think The Day's Rising could work with Erkenbrand's ability since he didn't take damage from the attack. The phrasing "takes no damage while defending that attack" is a little unclear though. 

 

As for the readying effect I can see what you mean, but in practice I think I would still prefer neutral for its overall utility. Either way it would be a welcome addition to the cardpool.

Pretty clear to me. From the moment a hero is declared as a defender, until the attack fully resolves, that hero is considered to be defending that attack, and if he takes any damage, regardless of the source, while defending that attack, you cannot trigger the Day's Rising.

The best that can be said is that this card works with Dori's ability.  Dori has to exhaust for his ability, but there's no requirement for the other hero, so Dori can exhaust to add to a defense made by this card.  But it's not really a card that rewards Dori for using his ability, and with the additive effect it gets with copies in the discard, it's not likely to need Dori's help to tank up, either.
