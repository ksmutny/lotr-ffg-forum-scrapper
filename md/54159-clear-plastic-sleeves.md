Where is the best lace to get clear plastic sleeves that fit LoTR LCG and CoC LCG?

Â 

Is this the one that fits? Is tehre a way to buy larger ammounts?

Friendly Local Gaming Shop

I believe FFG make their own, personally I use a cheaper brand, which are fine for my purposes.

I'm the people in the shop will be able to tell you the options they have available.

what brand do you use?

I've been using Dragon Shields but there must be a cheaper option.
