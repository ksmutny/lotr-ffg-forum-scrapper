Can I have your stereo? And your LotR cards? I mean, assuming the heart attack is fatal.

Oh, that's nice...at least for people living in the US. I couldn't find any online store to pre-order the game that has decent international shipping options...40usd shipping cost for a 40usd game! Guess I'm stuck with amazon japan and their shipping date is Jun 11th...sorpresa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sorpresa.gif]

 YES! I get LOTR on the 18th and the new Playbook on the 19th! If only I didn't have to pay taxes, this would be the best month ever.

Nope, at least not in France where the game has been announced for the 18th too ! ^^

## 14 [ClydeCloggie on April 13, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45164-april-18th/?do=findComment&comment=453331)

But that's probably the locally-sourced French language version?

## 15 [Urielsama on April 13, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45164-april-18th/?do=findComment&comment=453359)

Indeed, but well, you know, I'm french so I'd rather have it in my native language ^^ Maniacske was asking about Belgium, with a little luck he's not that far from the frontier, or Millennium (the french distributor) is also supplying Belgium.

Ok i am a little confused.FFG is an US company so the original version of the game must  be in English right? ...and in the French and Spanish site says world wide release date 18th April.

How can France take the translated version first(April 18th) and the other europian countries the English version later?

What i miss here?

Probably because the French ans Spanish language versions are produced locally, while the english language versions are being shipped from the US. Just a guess but seem likely.

I am sure that we will not have a Greek version(we never have one) of the game so anyone knows what's the release date for the English version for Europe?

## 20 [Frank36 on April 14, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45164-april-18th/?do=findComment&comment=453486)

In Germany the game will be available the 18th (the german version of the game).

I heard it may be a little later than the 18th in Canada.  Is this true, and if so, anyone know what the date will be?  The local game shop owner wasn't even all too sure of when, he just told me failry soon.

I just talked with the local game shop owner and he told me that the game will come to us until the end of the month so i think in Canada you will have a closer release date.

Greece economy was never that good overall, but it's true when he says that Europe is in a real bad shape right now... Including (my country) Portugal and I even think Spain is worse than us =x Oh... btw... have I said that right now Portugal has NO president? lol... he just quit his job xD really... wtf is going on in this world... anyway... there will be new elections...

At least there is no war and we are a peaceful country... I'm glad for it ^_^ [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_happy.png]

It usually takes a couple extra days for it to arrive to us up here. My store in Halifax usually has it 3-4 days after its official release date as it takes a bit longer for stuff to cross the border. Some stores in Canada do get it out on the shelves the day of. Course not even all stores in the US will have it on the shelves that day again depending on when their orders arrive, get shipped, how far etc. etc.

Hey, watch the banker talk!  I am a banker running a small rural bank (5th generation, 120+ years in the family...which is a lot in the US, probably not in Greece).  We don't make that much, and just want our community to succeed...and we probably are one of the top 3-4 contributors to non-profits in our small town.  Now, investment bankers...you probably have something there! 

Anyways, I pre-ordered through FFG directly, so hopefully will see it VERY soon.

I first thought that your reply was a good chance for a sarcastic comment but my English are poor and i don't want to sound rude.I will leave jokes to others who can use English language betterlengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif].

Anyway after April 18th i wil try to avoid forums cause those who will take the game first they will discuss many things about the scenarios and i don't want to know what i will face in this game before i get my box.So if you see me write here after April 18th please kick me from the forumssad.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sad.gif].

I pre-ordered from Cardhaus here in the US. I was a bit tenuous, because I was checking if other people had ever had any issues with them..  and I found some back from a good few years back, but nothing recent.

However that prompted me to be a bit cheeky with them. I told them they could earn my trust by shipping that box on the 18th!

When I've pre-ordered games from FRPGames, they've shipped me orders in advance so that the item arrives on the actual release date. Amazon has done the same thing. I don't know if this common practice or if I just lucked out but it's awesome when this happens.

Whenever you do dig into your copy, will you please tell me how many Player Cards come with only one copy in a core set? I'd like to know, for the sake of science.

How can You bought it? The release for all countries and shops is on monday, so how?

But if You have it tell us how many card of each type are there?

That's totaly unfair, I will have to wait for my copy until next week and I will have it only maybe before Easter. Totaly unfair.

Ok, Come over to my place and let me be Your worst nightmarish encounter deck.

I would give out  three of my four spheres decks to spend this evening playing this Game with You guys. In about an hour i will have time to unpack the game so if You think it will help to overwhelm your interior itching start a new thread with question I will post all info i will find. Just take into account that it is national edition :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] so my translation of cards may be a little uncorrect :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I descend into mirkwood soon, Hope You will follow me and either catch me in the evening at campfire, or avenge me should my struggle with The Shadow One make me join the sphere where all children of Iluvatar finish their fate :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png].

Okay, now let's see...

226 Cards total, 12 heroes, 4 heroes per Sphere.

10 Adventure Cards

120 Player Cards, so each Sphere Starter Deck contains 30 Cards (29 of each Sphere plus Gandalf, who is included four times in the core set)

84 Encounter Cards

 

I have tried two of the Spheres, but couldn't succeed on finishing the first Scenario. But I must admit that I haven't played any of those card games yet so everything is quite new to me, so I'm not sure if my strategies (if you can call them so) are very efficient. I'll try to combine two of the spheres next, hope this will make it a bit easier for me...

## 58 [bonzo4 on April 16, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45164-april-18th/?do=findComment&comment=454489)

A bit more detail maybe on the Player Cards:

I counted two of the Spheres (Tactics and Knowledge in German, the red and the green one)

29 Cards each.

 

Kowledge:

7 Allies (2x1 copy, 3x2copies, 2x3copies = 14 Ally cards total)

5 Events (2x1 copy, 3x2 copies = 8 Event cards total)

4 Reinforcements (1x1 copy, 3x2 copies = 7 Reinforcement cards total)

 

Tactics:

4 Allies (1x1 copy, 1x2 copies, 2x3 copies = 9 Ally cards total)

7 Events (2x1 copy, 4x2 copies, 1x3 copies = 13 Event cards total)

4 Reinforcements (1x1 copy, 3x2 copies = 7 Reinforcement cards total)

 

I don't know if this information is useful to anyone, but if you wish I can add information about the other Spheres aswell if you like :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Yes! Definitely, thank you! Keep it coming! Could you name some of the allies and what sphere they belong to, if you recognize their name? I mean, if they're characters from the books that you recognize.

I know I shouldn't argue with the man who actually has the cards in hand, but I feel compelled to!

The online rulebook, page 10, says that there are only fifteen player cards that are green, they are the cards numbered 58-72. Your total, however, equals 16 (7 ally + 5 events + 4 reinforcements). However, the deck you listed does have 29 cards, that is exactly correct. Is it possible that you counted one of the cards as two different cards? Or, is the rulebook wrong and there really are 16 different cards? I'm dying of curiousity!

Also, please post the rest of the spheres, Leadership and Spirit, I am very eager for more information!

## 67 [ffgfan on April 17, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45164-april-18th/?do=findComment&comment=454712)

Thanks for all the info. I just hope that I will not have to wait for this game to long. I want to have it before Eater, maybe it will be possible.

Sorry, my mistake. Counted the cards once again and there are

Reinforcements: 4 (1x1, 3x2 = 7)

Allies: 5 (1x1, 3x2, 1x3)

Events: 6 (1x1, 4x2, 1x3)

Some shops in Europe say that the english version of the game should be avaliable about 18th May 2011. That's a bad news becouse many of us are waiting for it. So I won't get it before Easter. sad.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sad.gif]

## 71 [radioboyeric on April 18, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45164-april-18th/?do=findComment&comment=455328)

I'm thinking those shops have the date incorrect. My shop that I've pre-ordered said they should have it the week of April the 18th.

I'm thinking they might have gotten the month wrong. Damnit, it better be wrong, another month of waiting would be dreadful!!!!

## 72 [CrowOfPyke on April 18, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45164-april-18th/?do=findComment&comment=455337)

Hmmmmmmmmmmm....  I preordered and all of the sites I have looked at do not say they are shipping, still listed as a preorder item.  And the FFG site still says 'Available Soon'.  It looks like it won't be shipping today.  Which is strange, because the site I ordered from normally doesn't charge your card until they are ready to ship, and they dinged my card on Friday....

Ebay has the game for preorder and has a release date for April 19th but i dont't know how ebay works.Someone experienced with ebay can tell us?

## 74 [Spirit Juggler on April 18, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45164-april-18th/?do=findComment&comment=455356)

It's showed up on my local stores list as available to order and should be with them next week. That's in English by the way. That means they've had the order list from their stockist 'Esdevium games' and it was listed on the list as being available for next week. 

## 75 [Ahzrab on April 18, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45164-april-18th/?do=findComment&comment=455357)

FFG said that it was being shipped to stores as of I believe the 12th. It says that it comes in between 7-10 days.

So, by right it should be in stores starting tomorrow thru the week according to FFG shipping standards.

The last time I anticipated something so much was the birth of my daughter!!!! (well not really, you get the picture though)

I WANT IT NOW...is what I'm really saying....

I just had the horrible experience of going down to my LGS which is 45 minutes away, thinking they'd have it this morning only to find out that it won't be in until Thursday... I'm so bummed. Let the patient torture continue....

April 20th more like it. I am taking a half day off work for my birthday and should have it by 12 o clock and going to be soloing it up.

Amazon is currently listing the game as 'IN STOCK' with shipping available to deliver by tomorrow for the next 21 minutes.

 

Hopefully this means I actually get the game I pre-ordered from another site either tomorrow or the next day....

If I need a second copy (and I believe that I do) I will definitely get it from Amazon. Right now I am playing chicken with them, to see if they drop the price any further.
