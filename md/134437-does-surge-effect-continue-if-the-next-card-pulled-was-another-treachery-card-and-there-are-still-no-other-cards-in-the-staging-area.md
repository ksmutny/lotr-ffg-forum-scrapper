I just started playing, and it was solo.  There were no cards in the staging area.  I drew the encounter card and it was "Driven by Shadow".  I resolved the "surge" effect by drawing another encounter card but then another treachery card, "The Necromancer's Reach" came out.  Do I continue to draw until a card can go into the staging area?  Or do I resolve questing as if the enemy number to beat is 0?

When you reveal a card from the encounter deck, if it's an enemy or location you trigger its keywords and any when revealed abilities and then they go to the staging area. If it's a treachery then you just discard it after resolving it's effects. This still counts as revealing your one card from the deck, so you are questing against 0 threat in the staging area in this case.
