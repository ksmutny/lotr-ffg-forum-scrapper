I hope everyone has a great September the 22nd and finds a time to celebrate the combined birthday of Frodo and Bilbo Baggins!

For me, I've spent a good deal of the day outside under the trees in the great first-day-of-Fall weather reading the first part of the Fellowship of the Ring.  I'll also fry up some nice crispy bacon this evening. 

 

Unfortunately I won't receive the Black Riders expansion in the mail until tomorrow, so I guess I'll just have to extend the celebration into tomorrow as well!

 

How will you celebrate?

Well, we played with my wife Hills of Emyn muill, beating it easily, and then crashed twice in the gates of Dol Guldur , though the first we came really close, loosing by threat rising cause of shadow cards ( I raised my threat by 10 during combat face)

Then our kids woke up hehehe
