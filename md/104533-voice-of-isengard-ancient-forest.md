Hi everybody... I have another question.... :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

The location ancient forest says:

While Ancient Forest is in the staging area, each Forest location in the staging area gets +1 Threat and +3 quest points.

What does this last point means?

For this, you can open your handy-dandy digital copy of the game manual [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/ffg_content/lotr-lcg/support/LOTR_LCG_Core_rules_eng_Lo-Res.pdf] and do a search for "quest point." Â It will tell you that quest points are the number of progress tokens you must place on a location before it is considered 'explored!' (oops I just did it for you!)

I mean... + 3 quest point ... Is it a benefit or what?
