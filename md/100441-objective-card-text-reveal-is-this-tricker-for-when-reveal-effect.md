An Quest card reads " look at top 3 card of the encounter deck. Reveal and add 1 those cards the staging area and discard the other 2 card." Do I have to resolve when reveal effect if one of this 3 card has one card whit when reveal effect ? Hope You get what I mean!

Well.... why not ?

Â 

Unless you are saying that only one of those 3 as a when revealed effect and it's one of the two you discarded. In that case, no, the only card revealed is the one you choose to reveal and add.

Note that "Reveal and add" is an early writing mistake, when vocabulary was not very normalised. A card is revealed or added, and both have a different sense: "add" does not trigger "when revealed" whereas "reveal" does. Here "Reveal" would have sufficed.
