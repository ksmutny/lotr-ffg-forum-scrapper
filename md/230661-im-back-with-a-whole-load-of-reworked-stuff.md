Hi. Remember my recent "Friends long forgotten" thread? I've shown some cards I reworked there. Well, in this thread, I will be showing most of the stuff I reworked (the one I at least feel somewhat comfortable with). There is plenty of cards to go around, that's why I created imgur albums for each sphere, for easier nagivation:

 

 
Leadership:

Lore:

Tactics and Neutral:

Feel free to diss anything you see, but argumented criticism is most welcome. Also, I would like to know if anybody feels I left out a card that in a dire need of rework and is not applicible/too powerful in the current game state. In the end, this is just fun hobby for me.
 
P.S.: Sorry, imgur keeps messing the order of leadership and spirit albums for some reason, I tried to re-organized them, but it just mixed the cards right back.

Some I love, some I dislike because they mess with cards I already like as is, some are OP, all are interesting. I would say your design abilities are improving noticeably. I think the one trend I almost universally loved was adding valour effects to old cards. I don't think there was one I didn't like. Makes me wish they had valour from the beginning.

Fairly bored at work today so let me give you brief feedback for each! (or at least the leadership cards as there are WAY MORE than I initially thought!)

I'm actually planning to do something sort of similar soon but rather than changing existing cards I'm going to make a bunch of new custom ones to try and improve upon existing traits and provide cards to fix what I see as weaknesses for certain traits or deck types (especially the warrior trait).
Really love the custom cards you make, they could really breathe new life into some next to useless older cards. I just wish that FFG legitimately made some of these cards like this originally because I am too much of a stickler for the rules to actually use custom cards during games. I still really enjoy reading them and thinking about how much better/more fun they would be to play with  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] 
 

Leadership:
-Rear Guard. Hmmm I really like the new effect and design on Rear Guard but you could use 2 or 3 copies in one turn and simply discard allies like Squire of the Citadel to give all heroes across the board +2 or +3 to all stats. It can also be recycled with the leadership Tome for a total of six uses. Maybe limit once per round? I do like that the doomed 1 provides an extra "cost" to use the card though. Also just till end of phase limits abuse.. hmm maybe it isn't necessary to limit it to once per round. Also perhaps it should at least be an ally that is controlled by the player playing the card rather than any ally in play to make it at least a little more restrictive/less awesome. It combos insanely well with the various allies that leave play at the end of the round anyway because you can quest with them then after the quest phase (when they are more or less useless unless you can ready them) you can discard them pre-emptively to boost your heroes combat capability. Gives more use to Elrond, Galadriel, Gandalf allies.

-Son of Arnor is great. I like that it now combos with other "surprise" cards (cards that care about enemy engagement vs your own threat). 
-Longbeard Orc Slayer. I actually prefer this card as 1 damage to all orc enemies in play. I know that it is restrictive and does nothing in quests that don't have orc enemies but he is called Longbeard Orc Slayer so to me it is unthematic if he damages any type of enemy. That being said your design definitely makes him a much more viable card for all quests rather than just ones that include orc enemies. I like that you gave him a point of willpower as well. For four cost even with his ability he should be able to quest for at least 1. 
-Steward of Gondor. I am in what I believe is the small majority that has absolutely no issue whatsoever with Steward of Gondor and don't think it needs any errata or changes whatsoever. The only single change I would make to Steward is changing the title of the card and it no longer providing the Gondor trait. It should be called something completely different (yet still being unique) so that it isn't a massive thematic fail placing it on anyone but Denethor. It should be a card that makes sense on pretty much any hero considering it is used on such a wide range of heroes by players of the game. 

-Taking Initiative is a fantastic card and I wouldn't change anything. If this is how the actual card operated it would almost be auto include in any ranger decks that use leadership in my opinion. 

-Keen Eyed Took is fantastic. Works great with the "surprise"mechanic and is no longer useless. I like the 1 point of attack you added as well. 

-Dawn take you all. Hmmm I would have liked a change to this card that helped it from doing nothing so often. I hate that this card can so easily fail and cancel nothing at all especially at 2 cost. Making it only cost 1 and adding doomed 1 instead definitely makes it more viable considering even if it does fail at least it only costs 1 instead of 2. The valour effect also helps with viability as it allows it to discard far more shadow cards at once which means it has a much better chance of actually cancelling some nasty shadow effects. I think that overall the redesign for this card is actually really good and makes it a much better card and far more viable but for some reason I am still not a fan of the card. Perhaps I just don't like the idea of paying resources to blindly discard shadow cards. I would rather shadow cancellation or cards that allow me to discard shadow cards regularly without paying each time like Armoured Destrier etc.

-Sword that was broken. Hmmmm I don't think anything is wrong with the original card unlike many of the other cards you have reworked (which desperately need an update/boost) but I do really like your version. I like that it gives the resource match for anyone not just Aragorn. I like that it requires the attached hero to be questing to give the boost as well as just getting the boost no matter what is pretty **** powerful. It is also a nice counterpoint against the fact it now provides a resource icon to any Dunedain hero not just Aragorn. I hate the restricted slot though.... I am strongly against adding restricted to pretty much any card as I think enough cards already have restricted on them as is and making more attachments restricted only limits deckbuilding even more. Other than restricted really love this redesign. Oh actually one other thing... I do think it needs to do something only if the attached hero is Aragorn as thematically it really is supposed to go on him. Perhaps like Snowmane it can lose the restricted keyword if attached to Aragorn? I would add that but keep everything else the same or I would just remove restricted altogether. Haha I recognised that symbol for Innistrad (the cool curved V shape) straight away in the art even though I haven't played magic for years.

-Sneak attack. I like this redesign as well but it might be too good with Gandalf. I really like that it makes Sneak attack actually worthwhile in conjunction with other allies considering as of now it is only really good with a select few allies. This change would make it a decent card when used with just about any ally thanks to the boost they receive. I really like this change but it would make Sneak attack + Gandalf just way too good. Other than that very simple but very cool redesign. 

-Fresh Tracks is great. Very small change but a great one. Rather than using the ability to not engage the enemy you can instead choose to engage the enemy optionally and it helps trigger "surprise" mechanics and abilities.

-We are not Idle is fairly different from the original. I like that you put a limit on it and a cost of 1 as well. You now need to exhaust at least 2 Dwarf characters to get a boost which in dwarf swarm decks really isn't hard or much of a setback. I've never run or used dwarf decks before so I can't really judge this card accurately but it seems as though you have made the card a lot less overpowered and a bit more reasonable. 

-Brok Ironfist. This redesign is one of my favourites. Well costed decent ally that is a fair bit cheaper when a dwarf character is destroyed and is free if a dwarf character is destroyed while you are in valour. Well costed, cool ability that makes sense. Everything that the original should have been! Also he is unique so you can't put more than one into play cheaply or for free anyway. 

-Dunedain Wanderer. As far as I can see you just upped the willpower to 2. Even though its such a minor change it is a good one. For 5 cost he should be 2/2/2 (there are plenty of 2/2/2 characters that are 4 cost) and even at only 2 cost in secrecy he is just that tiny bit better. I still would not use this card outside secrecy (3 or 4 resources is sort of my limit for ally cost and if im using an ally that costs more than 3 or 4 they better have one hell of an awesome or unique ability!) but it is definitely a bit more viable outside of secrecy now and far better with secrecy. 
-Common Cause is cool and still costs 1 but overall performs fairly differently. You need to trigger it now as you exhaust the original character. This means it is a little more restrictive as to when you can use it however you don't have to exhaust a hero to use the card anymore and instead just use it AS you exhaust a hero to use them for something else. I like this because you aren't just swapping one hero for another you are getting an additional action out of this card (rather than swapping who can perform an action) which honestly is better considering you are using up a card and a resource to do so. Bit more bang for your buck. It is very cheap readying however so that extra card on top might be a bit too good. Then again something like Descendants of Kings only costs 1 leadership resource and that can ready several characters and is almost always going to ready at least one or two so the card draw on top is probably spot on. Just the readying effect probably wouldn't be enough to justify using this card over lots of other cheaper readying effects. 

-Celebrians Stone. I like the redesign on this one but again I think it needs to have some effect that only triggers if it is attached to Aragorn as he is the intended receipient. Because it now gives the resource icon to any Dunedain hero perhaps it could only give +1 willpower but +2 if attached to Aragorn? I really like the discard effect if you have any copy. Really clever and cool mechanic for multiple copies of unique cards. Certain unique allies should have similar mechanics so that extra copies can still be used for something other than discard fodder/backup incase the ally dies. 

-Silverlode Archer. Fits in far more nicely with the Silvan mechanics and deck type now. Still an expensive ally for the stats so the ability makes sense and doesn't seem overpowered. 
-Guard of the Citadel. Hmmmmm does this guy need to cost 3 now? 3 defence and 2 hitpoints whilst ALSO still having a point of willpower and a point of attack is one HELL of a bargain for 2 resources. I know that he will only have 3 def in a deck using three Gondor Heroes but that is obviously the deck you are going to use him in. We do have lots of other decent defensive allies for 2 cost but they usually only have 1 hitpoint or have zero will or attack as well. He can also receive several boosts being a Gondor character so could easily be 2/2/3/2 with Visionary Leadership and Boromir leadership. Really can't decide if I think he should cost 3 now or should still cost 2 but heavily leaning towards 3 as he is just too good at only 2 cost in any dedicated Gondor deck. 
-For Gondor. Another very simple but great redesign. Made no sense that the old card boosted all characters attack and only boosted Gondor characters defence. This is better thematically and mechanically. 

-Dunedain Watcher. I have included this ally in my decks lots of times and every single time.... it is to have more shadow cancellation and control. Never is she included for any other reason... I like that you give her an additional point of willpower making her actually useful for something other than her ability. Even just that single point of willpower I think is more than enough to make her a much more viable and useful card. The extra ability can only be used when in valour though so definitely doesn't make her too good or anything. It is just a feint effect and you do still have to discard her so I actually quite like the additional ability as well. If this card was actually designed like this the first thing I would be doing tonight is including 3 copies in my decks! The actual version of the card I just cannot bring myself to use anymore ESPECIALLY with the addition of new shadow control cards like Armoured Destrier and whatnot that are just so much better. 

-Ever Vigilant. With so many more readying effects and cards these days a card like this is next to useless. It is still worth using in conjunction with high cost powerful allies that have good all round stats or with for example Ents but overall unless it is being used in a specific way is pretty bad and doesn't compare to many other options we have these days. Hell you can trigger this effect once per turn (or more depending!) with Leadership Faramir hero for free! This new version costs zero which I think is fitting and replaces itself (by drawing a card) if the targeted ally shares a trait with each of your heroes. Still not the best card ever but definitely a far more valuable and affordable effect with the redesign. 

-Grave Cairn. Love that it just provides +3 across the board and costs zero. Pretty much the leadership version of Unseen Strike but instead of needing to have a lower threat than the enemies engagement you need a character to have been destroyed or discarded that turn. A much better and much more viable version. May be a little too strong with Eomer though as for one resource and one ally death he goes from 3 attack to a whopping 8 for one resource. 

-Valiant Sacrifice. Just like your redesign of Grave Cairn is almost like a leadership version of Unseen Strike with a different trigger this is like the leadership version of Foe Hammer! Instead of destroying an enemy with a hero that has a weapon attachment you need an ally to be destroyed or discard and only draw 2 instead of 3 if the ally was not unique. I really like this redesign as well although 3 cards for 0 cost even if you are losing a unique character at the same time is pretty **** good. The fact that the loss of the ally is not because of this card and just an additional cost I think this might be a bit too strong at 0 cost.

Perhaps it should still cost 1 but should still have the extra card drawn for unique characters. I think I prefer it costing 0 but it might just be too strong. If you have two of these in hand you can draw 6 cards without any cost (well other than the cards taking up space in your deck) after losing a unique ally and if you are playing with unique allies that can be discarded or destroyed and then brought back (or returned to hand) like Glorfindel or Gamlings effect you can sort of semi abuse this effect as you get the ally back anyway but still get this huge card draw.

Why does Glorf look the other side?

Edit: you cannot actually play Word of Command since there are no Istarti characters in play.

Care to elaborate at least a little? :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

 

PsychoRocka, now getting to you.

 

Rear Guard - just a clarification, but you cannot discard an ally you don't control (you can't generally pay for card effects with stuff you have no control over), so I decided to not waste text box space with a redundant clarification.

 

Steward of Gondor - I'm not just trying to stomp on Steward, I'm also trying to give way for other resource generating effects.

 

Keen Eyed Took - it feels to me like a 2-cost 1/1/0/2 ally became somewhat "good tone" for this game. Deviations from that stat box should be followed by some significantly effective card texts. Example of fail: Mirkwood Pioneer (oh man, I should probably buff him too! need to find a fitting art now, ****). He has an optional doomed trigger, yet his stat sux major league balls and you'll never pay 2 for him outside the rare need to trigger his ability. Generally, you wouldn't even include him.

 

Sword that was Broken - you know me, I hate significant effects only available to a single name out of the entire roster. Also, the power of this card rose significantly with it being able to work on any Dunedain or Noble, not just Aragorn, so nerfs in form of restricted are not that devastating to me. On the doing something for Aragorn... I can think of it costing 1 less for him, like Helgruim (sorry if I misspelled that, don't wanna to break the answer for google) costs 1 less for Theonden. However, dat text box is already crowded...

Also, about the art. It's surprised me greatly, but I couldn't find a **** thing that remotely resembles the sword that was broken. If anybody has anything - please, SEND!

 

Sneak Attack - you might wan't to reserve your judgement until you see what have I done with Gandalf ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

 

Dunedain Wanderer - I also upped his health to 3. But the main change is willpower, yes, as I consider stuff that can't properly quest - has no place in secrecy.

 

Common Cause - exactly on spot. These old "little" cards, their badness is half of their misfortune, the other half is how little they actually do. You need to add them some additional bang to entice the player to use them, however you cannot add the flat bang, so you need to make it optional to keep the balance at bay.

 

Guard of the Citadel - the entire point of his optional boost is to keep him at cost of 2. He was previously just a 1/1/0/2 Gondor body. There is 1/1/0/1 neutral Gondor body that essentially costs 1, and there is also 1/1/0/2 Gondor body with cost 2 that can move resources, so I opted for him to fit his name and be actual Guard. 3 def is strong, yet I don't think that would break the game, as Leadership (especially gondor) has few defenders, and 3def/2hp is still pretty fragile, enemies exceed attack of 3 frequently, and any shadow attack boost will easily spell doom for the Guard.

 

Dunedain Watcher - if there is a single thing I learned, it's that self-discarding characters should pack a punch.

 

Ever Vigilant - this was a very tough one for me. Readying ally is a very worthless thing to do most of the time, and if I slap too much bonuses on top - it can grow out of proportion. It might still be on the weaker side, so I'll see what I can do.

 

Grave Cairn - I did a research and found out there are almost no allies who could provide any significant attack boosts for this card to be remotely viable (cept for sneaky Gandalf, but that is too narrow for me), so I went for flat +3 attack. Also, I went from "leaves play" to "is discarded or killed" to fit the theme more (and justify the cost reduction). It's also not in the same sphere as Eomer, so all is not lost :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

Valiant Sacrifice - as with Grave Cairn, I removed the resource cost, but change the trigger from leaving play to being discarded or killed, so you won't be getting cards for sneak attacks, feigning voices, or etc. The cost 0 is associated with the fact that you're 100% losing a character, and probably not in a good way for you.

Ah yeah I totally forgot that you can't exhaust or discard allies you don't control yourself for player card costs. I remember there was a huge rules discussion about this quite a while back.

Have you thought about white tower watchman i would like to add a gondor synergy? Mabye a additional response, if you controll only gondor heroes you may give white tower watchman +2 defense for a resource, until the end of the phase.

I like what you have done with the cards, not all but many of them. keep up the good work.

I find White Tower Watchman an extremely valuable and potent card already. 2def/3health neutral defender for 3 is already nothing to sneeze at, even outside the monosphere.

> I find White Tower Watchman an extremely valuable and potent card already. 2def/3health neutral defender for 3 is already nothing to sneeze at, even outside the monosphere.

Could be true?? I have never seen the card outside of monosphere bulids. And if you play with 3 gondor heroes you have a very low willpower, you could at least use a decent defender also to pay a resource is not cheap.

A check at ringsdb shows 90 decks with White Tower Watchmen, all are monosphere except three -- a leadership/Gandalf deck (w. Narya), a lone Gondor deck, and a Seastan deck that has every ally in it.  There's no shame in being just a monosphere card, though.

## 11 [John Constantine on September 22, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/230661-im-back-with-a-whole-load-of-reworked-stuff/?do=findComment&comment=2426280)

Well, for a comparison, there are currently only 4 allies in the game that have 2 def and 3 health at the cost of 3. They are:

Dwalin

Longbeard Sentry

Wellinghall Preserver

and White Tower Watchman.

 

Just because it isn't used outside the monosphere doesn't means he has no potential outside one. He costs only 3, so that means he could be played turn one in any combination of spheres deck (as long as there is at least 3 heroes).

Posting in the right thread this time:

 

specific tactics/neutral mounts:

 

Firefoot:  Losing restricted for Eomer is a better buff than giving +2 attack only to Eomer.  Taking up a restricted spot, it really needs +2 attack for attacking alone to be justified, and without attacking alone it's certainly not worth 2-cost to buff attack by one.

 

Rohan Warhorse: +1 attack is a welcome buff, given the restricted slot use.  Switching eligiblity from tactics to warrior is a thematic touch.

 

Arod: giving it +1 attack and restricted is necessary given the 1 mount requirement you've imposed.  I like Legolas losing restricted, I don't like that Legolas ally can no longer use Arod.

 

Shadowfax:  I like using the restricted-not-on-Gandalf to widen eligiblity to "Istari heroes", even though Gandalf is the only Istari hero.  I can hope it won't always be that way.

There's a fifth ally, Skinbark.  But no one plays Dwalin for 3, his special ability is to cost 1 with 5+ dwarves.  Longbeard Sentry can buff his defense by discarding off deck, which certain decks like to do anyway.  Wellinghall Preserver has 3 wp and heals ents when readying, plus has 2 attack -- even entering exhausted, he outclasses the other 3-cost 2def/3hp non-uniques by an amazing margin.  (Skinbark has 4 attack and smashes orcs, but as a unique he's not directly comparable.)

 

Yes, you can play him turn one in any combination of spheres deck.  I just can't envision a deck where my best play on turn one would be to put a 1/0/2/3 ally in play, at the cost of all my resources, with no special abilities.  As just a body, I don't think he's worth 3, even with being easy to play.

Hum with the new Noldor stuff Guardian of Rivendell is even better with 1/2/3/3, Wtw with total def and hp of 5 he wont survive many attacks and often becomes a very expensive chumpblocker. Mabye he is to good with +2 def for one resource (but that response only works with 3 gondor heroes) and i you use his response all the time you can play very little else. All i want is to give him some gondor synergy like what you did with the guardian. And gondor usually uses resources for different effects.

Another thought, The sword that was broken has be used by the descendants of the Numerorians. It should be usable by duendain and gondor heroes and mabye black Numenorians as well. Also i like that not only Artagorn can use TSTWB  thou i think that if its attached to aragorn it should give him a small bonus, i have no idea what thou.

Guardian of Rivendell also costs 2 cards from your cards. Dwalin is unique, Skinbark is unique and is entering play exhausted as well as Wellinghall Preservers. The only one at the real direct advantage is Longbeard Sentry, who still requires you to spend entire round worth of tactics resoruces. And I was only judging by the defending capabilities, don't compare the other stuff. My main point was there are pretty few defenders in the game, and White Tower Watchman is too decent one to get dismissed just because of monosphere ability.

I already got little thing brewing. It cost 1 less on Aragorn.

I guess we think differently, thats good. I feel thou that gondor should be the bulwark of the west therfore it should have descent defenders (outside of beregond or blood of numenor) they dont, you dont think so. Also i still feel that Gondor is underdeveloped i remember an episode from the grey company saying that gondor lacks "glue cards" i agree thou i feel its a bit better today but not by much. Therefor i wanted to make a glue card, thats my reasoning, and thematically a white tower watchman should be an elite guard and therefore warant a good defense.

> Guardian of Rivendell also costs 2 cards from your cards. Dwalin is unique, Skinbark is unique and is entering play exhausted as well as Wellinghall Preservers. The only one at the real direct advantage is Longbeard Sentry, who still requires you to spend entire round worth of tactics resoruces. And I was only judging by the defending capabilities, don't compare the other stuff. My main point was there are pretty few defenders in the game, and White Tower Watchman is too decent one to get dismissed just because of monosphere ability.

I guess my trouble is that I don't think of 2/3 as a decent defender.  In a hero I think 2/3 has potential as a defender, once you can get attachments to get them up to 4+ defense and can cancel nasty shadows, but I wouldn't risk them for defense unaided except against the weakest of foes.  But a 2/3 ally?  That's a decent *emergency* defender, but he's not going to defend multiple times except against very weak foes, and 3 cost is just too much for a two-hit chump.

 

White Tower Watchman *does* have something else going for it, in monosphere.  Which is why it's pretty much exclusively in monosphere decks.

 

As a direct defender, I'd rather have Wellinghall Preserver than White Tower Watchmen.  Yes, it's harder to pay for, yes it enters exhausted -- but it's also a natural target for Burning Brand and *self-healing*.  But I rarely defend with the preserver, because their 3 wp is so awesome.

 

Longbeard Sentry does cost a full round of tactics resources.  It's also less popular than White Tower Watchmen, and is found almost exclusively in dwarf decks and/or decks that want to discard.  It's 2/3 base defense just isn't enough to buy it for the body, especially in a sphere where you can get 4/1 for 2 resources.  You can also turn Longbeard Sentry into an actual reliable defender with Raiment of War, which doesn't work on White Tower Watchman.

More tactics allies:

 

Veteran of Nanduhirion -- strictly better and the 2-cost discount in Valour territory is terrific.  The original is too expensive, I like this revision.

Beorning Beekeeper -- strictly better stats with a better ability.  The original was *way* too expensive, this is better.

 

I'm not sure I'd pay four for either of them still, but I'd certainly consider it in the right deck.

 

Horseback Archer -- 1 wp and a useful discard ability, I think this would make it a great card in a Rohan deck, which isn't really now.

 

Great job!

Longbeard orcslayer is not quiet my cup of tea as written mabye +1 attack and only damages orcs Valour action do 2 damage to all orcs of you discard the longbeard orcslayer. Its an orcslayer so it should kill orcs. i know it limits is uses but.

 

For gondor as written this card removes one of the only/few attackbosts in the coreset, so mabye a valour action as well and +1 attack for all somehow

 

The rest of the leadershipcards you have made i like.

Doesn't makes sense to me. You say Gondor lacks good defenders and should have them, I give you one, and you don't like that :o [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_ohmy.png]

 

Yes, defender of Rammas can have the same, and to top it off - he is in the same sphere with rainment.

Tactics attachments:

 

Dwarven Axe -- 1 cost at least makes it competitive with Dwarrowdelf Axe, though the damage requirement still makes it slightly inferior for a non-Gimli dwarf.  However, it does make it more attractive to non-dwarves (at least the warriors).  Good changes.

Elven Spear -- removes a Noldor discount vector, and benefits only from the same-phase other discards, but by maintaining a base +1 attack is at least usable when you run out of cards.

Blade of Gondolin -- I like that it adds its attack even without orcs, but I don't like the Noldor/warrior restriction.  Yes, Gondolin was an elvish city, but the three named blades we have in the text from Gondolin are all borne by non-elf, and all but Thorin are non-warriors.

 

Note that by changing Dwarven Axe and Blade of Gondolin to require trait/warriors, the number of tactics weapons for non-warrior attackers (barring a trait match), is the Dagger of Westernessee.  I like thematic linking, but the core set probably should be biased towards attachments that can be used for all heroes for practical reasons.

I feel that if you say a defence +1 for each gondor hero maximum of three he would be okay you can still make him a 4/4 thats really god i feel that tactics should have the upper hand in attack and defense over leadership just my preference

I was actually referring to the core set contents while designing those. 3 out of 3 tactics heroes from core set are warriors, and in other spheres there is 1 warrior in each.

Other tactics attachments:

 

Keeping Count:  I like the "search for another" mechanism.  That's the achilles heel of Keeping Count, and losing the hypothetical top-end rewards and paying 1 resource instead of zero is a small price to pay.

Horn of Gondor: By "discarding or destroyed" it's as thematic as the official nerf, but way more useful even with the 1/phase limit.  Adding 1 wp to the hero as well is sweet.

Gondorian Fire: limit 1, a +3 max attack bonus.  This is a dramatic nerf, but is it still worthwhile to set up a pay-1 for +3 attack with 3 resources kept in reserve?  It can be, but it's certainly much much less attractive.  But is it more interesting?  Not sure.  Not to me, at least.

True, but the attacker in leadership isn't going to be warrior Theodred, who usually quests, but non-warrior Aragorn with his 3 attack and self-readying.

 

Maybe Blade of Gondolin could be +1A for any hero, but +2A against orcs for Silvan/Noldor?

Blade of Gondolin serves different purpose - progress. It can't have more than 1 attack.  And enemy dependability is a territory I'm trying to leave, not return back to.

## 34 [dalestephenson on September 23, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/230661-im-back-with-a-whole-load-of-reworked-stuff/?do=findComment&comment=2426602)

Swift Strike -- minor buff for warriors, and I think it needs a buff -- it's a useful event, but other direct damage is cheaper.

Quick Strike -- this is one of the most powerful events already, giving it -2 defense makes it better than Feint IMO.

Stand together -- adding direct damage in addition to combined defense makes it comparable to Hail of Stones at a cheaper cost (but a different target).  I like it.

Blade Mastery -- 0-cost readying and a boost for the low cost of exhausting a weapon.  Better than Hold Your Ground or Behind Strong Walls.

Rain of Arrows -- I'm torn on this one.  One of the few benefits of the original version is that you don't need to wait until the enemy attacks, so with weak or weakened enemies it can actually save defenses.  This lets you do more direct damage if you've got the ranged characters free, but by doing it after the attacks have already taken place, the actual difference from the effect and using them as ranged attackers may not amount to much.  I think the new version is more situationally useful, but I'm not sure I'd include it in a deck anyways.

 

And the few neutral cards:

 

Gandalf -- nerfed for Sneak Attack.  The new-and-improved Sneak Attack takes away some of the sting, but I'd sorely miss the combo in leadership decks.  I like the secrecy add.

Boot from Erebor -- Weather-stained cloak provides most of the same coverage and costs 0 (though requires questing), and isn't popular.  I think this would see no use at all on dwarves, but hobbits are squishy enough that they might want this.  The original I *have* used on dwarves, specifically Gimli.

> Blade of Gondolin serves different purpose - progress. It can't have more than 1 attack.  And enemy dependability is a territory I'm trying to leave, not return back to.

A fair point, though in the case of Blade of Gondolin there's a strong thematic reason for it to be more effective against orcs.  I can accept that 2 attack is too much, combined with the progress with destruction, for a one-cost attachment.  But I also think there's a need for more than Dagger of Westernessee that can be attached to any hero.

> Care to elaborate at least a little? :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Well, you and I have a fundamental aesthetic difference in that I love items for specific characters and you despise them. So, I won't bother bringing those points up, except that I did not approve of the change that made it so Arod cannot go on ally Legolas. In general there needs to be more cool attachments on allies, not less, particularly unique allies. I do think you found a perfect compromise in dropping restricted for specific character. If you and I were in charge of LOTR I would be able to agree to that. It works pretty well.

You mount restriction of one per charcter is an absolute no brainer. Most of the time I self impose it anyway (and I am NOT a thematic player). It's just that dumb to have multiple mounts on a character.

Most of your power level "fixes" (nerfing OP or strengthening unerplayed) were subtle and effective. I like how you changed power in the earth, although it STILL might not be good enough. I thought Bombur was overall a good change, but I would still be okay with a bonus for "underground" locations, like "if it is an underground location draw a card". I think, in general, there should be more effort to reward elf tribe location control on "forest" locations and dwarf tribe on "underground" or "mountain" locations, but as an added bonus (so you can still run it on quests without those kinds of locations). It enhances the sense of place the game has as a strength.

I will say again, I love the added valour abilities on old cards. I think I liked lore Glorfindel the best. I liked what you did thematically with the eagle tribe. I was not sure about Eagles of Misty Mountains. I can understand why you made the change. With your version the Eagles can actually go out and come back (because they don't get attached). That is good. I just think the one time boost is not good enough. In fact, I might like it if the eagles could gain a resource when another eagle left play and get a stat boost from each resource, but that sounds so OP that it probably wouldn't work. I just like the permanent stat boost instead of one round.

I didn't like change to boots of erebor because it was too much like weather stained cloak.

I'm sure there was more, but I can't remember. That's what you get for now.

And just to chime in on the discussion, I think that Gondor, as a tribe, should be famous for lock down defense. It fits them is so many ways. In fact, I have always thought that Leadership Boromir should have give bonus +1 attack and +1 defense, to make him the Gondor's equivalent to Dain. That may have been OP but it would have made Gondor decks super fun and flavorful (and almost as good as dwarf decks). So, I basically think Gondor can't get enough defense. That's just my two cents.

I did not like that Arod can no longer go on Legolas ally as well, but it was a sacrifice I had to make to achieve my vision and prevent text box from becoming a bloated mess.

Lore

 

-Glorfindel. Fantastic redesign. Even without the valour response it is a simple but great redesign. Even with great stats his threat cost is very high so being able to heal a single point of damage each round for free is a fitting ability. I honestly think he is really great even without the valour response but I just LOVE how thematic and cool that ability is so I can't say a bad thing about it! His free inbuilt healing combined with Elrond allows you to run little to no healing player cards as you already have strong free healing available (2 per round for free is pretty **** decent especially in solo). This gives you more room to include other cards in your deck which is always good.
-Mirlonde. Again a great redesign for a hero that really needs it. To me the original version of Mirlonde is nigh unplayable. This version is not only playable but fairly good in a Silvan or Mono-lore deck. Minus 3 to starting threat and that nice response as well. Perhaps her response ability should only ready her though? Letting it ready any Silvan Hero might be a bit too good and readying her makes sense because it means you can use her to quest then attack getting the most out of her 2/2/1/3 statline. We need more characters with the scout trait and I hate heroes with only one trait so I like this addition too.

-Bilbo. Perhaps only 1 less threat considering his draw ability has been improved to any player. At 7 threat + the new version of his ability he is pretty fantastic. Then again he does have very average stats (2 def is wasted and 1 attack sucks, even 2 willpower is only ok) so perhaps the lower threat and better ability together are still balanced. I have never played this hero so have no idea to be honest.
-Gildor. Oh man why couldn't Gildor have been printed like this.... I have actually grown to really dislike Gildor.... I used to absolutely LOVE his card but that has faded. So his ability needs you to exhaust him yet he has absolutely awesome stats... as well as that Imladris Stargazer has a very similar effect and is very cheap to play. This means that the vast majority of games I do not use his ability at all and all he does is quest for 3 or occasionally defend with 3 (he is still amazing just boring and not used to his full potential). You can obviously combo his ability with Vilya to play something from your hand for free which admittedly can actually be really great if you end up with an great but expensive card in your hand and Vilya in play. With resource acceleration through Arwen though I can usually play whatever is in my hand fairly quickly and can then play a card of my choice for free with Vilya as well with the Stargazer.
So essentially his ability is rarely if ever necessary thanks to Stargazer and the fact that I usually need his 3 willpower far more than I need his ability. This version you have created is absolutely amazing. Rather than being able to use his ability per turn it only triggers the once but you don't need to exhaust him for it to trigger he just needs to enter play. I like that you only get to draw one and have to discard another and put the third back on your deck. Ties in with Noldor discard, still provides a tiny amount of scry (only the top card but still!) and draws you a card of your choice from the three. Maybe giving him the ability to be played from your discard is a bit much... I do really like this and he does cost 5 like Glorfindel and has similar amazing stats. The only issue is that his second ability will trigger again if he is destroyed/discarded then played again from your discard which is obviously your intent but as neat as this is perhaps this is a bit too good? Don't get me wrong I love the redesign as is but perhaps he is just that little tiny bit too strong. **** do I wish the actual Gildor only triggered his ability upon entering play and didn't require exhausting.....

Regarding Gildor - it always baffled me how such powerful stat box at such high price had such weak self-exhausting action. The only time I ever used his ability... I don't know, that one time when I didn't wanted to overquest for some reason and there was no enemies around.

 

As for his playability from discard pile... how frequently do you think you can play a 5 cost unique ally? It's one and 2/3 worth of turns in lore resources. Not to mention you need to play other stuff too.

Spirit Heroes:

 

Love Pippin.  Pippin's ability has no synergy with the all-hobbit deck it requires, but by reducing the threat penalty and allowing it to work all the time, he actually can be useful.

 

Glorfindel's adjustment is inspired -- he's still extremely useful as a secrecy enabler, but no longer serves as a threat lower for power decks.  Plus he's not tied at the hip to Light of Valinor any more.

 

Dwalin's loss of linkage to orcs makes him far more usable, if a bit less flavorable.  Increasing his wp and threat by one makes him more versatile, but also works against his attack-to-lower-threat ability.

Spirit allies:

 

Lorien Guide badly needed the buff, and 2 wp + progress on active location actually makes him worth the three.  Lowering 2 threat from leaving play (with a Silvan hero) is extremely powerful for Silvan decks, it seems almost too strong to me.

 

Westfold Horse Breaker -- I like making a thematic connection to mounts, but the problem is that by slapping a Limit 1 and restricted on all the mount cards, you can't afford to put anything but the perfect mount on a hero anymore.  And requiring a mount for his hero-readying abilities make his discard substantially weaker.

 

Not in the spirit ally section is Westfold Horse Breeder.  With the new mount scheme, I see her value and Elfhelm hero's value reduced.

Spirit Mounts:

 

Hobbit Pony has become restricted and limit 1, even though the text has five hobbit ponies for four hobbits.  There's no corresponding buff, it's a strictly worse card, and it goes from a useful to useless card for TaMerry.  I know I'm in the minority in not being bothered by multiple mounts, but you do plan on introducing Limit 1 weapon on all the weapons cards as well?  Still, I think the killer here *isn't* the limit 1 mount, it's slapping the restricted label on it for no good reason.

 

Snowmane was already restricted (except for Theoden), and the +1 wp just makes it better.  Ignoring the universal mount changes, it's strictly better.  I'd pay 2 for this.

 

Steed of Imladris also was already restricted, which I thought was annoying, but since it's questing focused that's usually not such an impediment.  The willpower buff when discarding makes it strictly better, but given the discard cost I don't think it's overpowered at one.

 

Steed of the Mark has acquired restricted, which severely hurts its value -- if you're paying to ready after questing, it means you want to fight, and you'll want those restricted slots for combat attachments.  Adding a wp buff when readying is nice, but I think the current card is better, even with a 1 mount limit.

 

I realize I skipped the Damrod ally in my last post.  A willpower/hp buff is good for a 4-cost ally who wasn't that tough in combat.  I'm still not sure I'd use him outside a Caldara deck, but he's at least worthy of consideration.

Other spirit attachments:

 

Favor of the Lady -- cheaper cost with a questing limitation makes it a good value generally, even if slightly less useful to Theoden/Eowyn hijinks.  The discard ability is a little odd, though, since you're at the mercy of the encounter deck for that ever triggering.  I'd like the rework better if it stayed at 2/+1wp, but had an action where it could be discarded for some effect better than +1 card.

 

Ever My Heart Rises -- the original is a bargain in mountain/underground quests with dwarf heroes, and useless elsewhere.  This one is useful in any deck, even if no dwarf is available to ready.  But who is the "you" who reduces the threat by 3?  I think that should be the "first player", or be conditional on dwarf hero readying and reduce the threat on that player.

 

Nor Am I Stranger -- the +1 card is badly needed, and puts it on a par with In Service of the Steward.

 

Power in the Earth -- much better than the unplayable original.  I like it.

 

Blood of Numenor -- mightly nerfed, along the lines of Gondorian Fire.  Still worth it?  Maybe.  It's a substantial investment, but +defense is more important than +offense IMO, and it still doesn't take a restricted spot.

 

Ring of Barahir -- I miss the thematic connection to Aragorn, but restricting it entirely to Dunedain/Noldor is better than allowing it on anyone.  The main effect is underwhelming for 2 (let's face it, it's usually underwhelming at 1), but does the ability to discard a copy for +2/+2/+2 save it?  IMO, no.  You have to play an overpriced Barahir for 2, and draw the other one for it even to come up, and it's main value just isn't good enough to justify 3x.  I like the idea of having an item be able to use its unplayable copies for something cool, but I think it needs to be something worth playing in the first place.

 

Hobbit Pipe -- +1 wp makes this card worth having and playing.  I like it.

Spirit events:

 

Late Adventurer -- +2 wp buff and -1 threat if it's a hobbit?  I'd pay 1 for this, 0 seems too cheap for the effect.

 

Mustering the Rohirrim -- I love combining the search effect with a sneak-attackish questing.  Nicely done.  I don't think the expanded search range of the original justified the 1-cost compared to similar search cards.

 

Stand and Fight -- I love dropping the clarifying text that justified the ridiculous no-Gandalf ruling.

 

Smoke Rings -- cost reduction to 1 was sorely needed, but what helps this event the most is making Hobbit Pipes more playable.

 

We Do Not Sleep -- weaker (requires successful questing), but *vastly* cheaper.  Too good?

 

Will of the West -- adding to victory display instead of removing from the game is consistent with other play-once cards, and enables Keen as Lances.  I like the change.

 

Untroubled by Darkness -- loses the thematic underground/dark connection, but the +2 hero/+1 ally is a nice compromise with the original.

 

Small target -- much, much more powerful.  I like this better than Feint even with the hobbit exhaustion requirement.  I'd pay 2 for this.

 

Strength of Will -- very different effect from the original, but certainly useful.  I like it.

 

A Light in the Dark -- A lot more usable than the original, with the -2 threat mitigating the threat from putting it back in staging.  Still expensive to avoid an attack, but more palatable.  Losing the -2 threat after a successful quest seems reasonable and interesting.

 

Renewed Friendship -- I like this a lot.  The original has too narrow eligibility to be very useful, even aside from it being so alturistic, while with this one helping others first may come back to help you.

 

And I see I forgot Unexpected Courage in the attachments.  Straight nerf of limit 1 -- while it downgrades UC, I don't see this is a painful nerf, it's still very useful with a 1-limit and it's still a rare card in the first place.

Favor of the Lady - you're actually not. There is plenty of Condition discarding player cards, and Favor of the Lady so happens to be a Condition.

 

Ever My Heart Rises - "you" is the owner of an attachment.

 

Ring of Barahir - this one was one of those crazy things I warned about. I'll think about something more reasonable.

 

We Do Not Sleep - refer to the Lure of Moria which readies all dwarves anywhere anywhen for just 1 more reasource in a sphere that is richer with resources than spirit. 

## 48 [dalestephenson on September 23, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/230661-im-back-with-a-whole-load-of-reworked-stuff/?do=findComment&comment=2428025)

Condition discarders:

 

Lore-2 ally Miner of the Iron Hills (discard a condition)

Spirit-0 (doomed 2) event Power of Orthanc

Lore-1 attachment Athelas, requires exhaustion of Dunedain/Healer and only discards condition of the healed character.

Lore-3 one-round ally Elrond, can discard a condition (or each draw a card, or heal a hero)

 

Yes, these player cards *could* be used to remove Favor of the Lady, assuming you thought trading a permanent +1wp for a single card was a good deal.  But they would *never* be included in a deck for that purpose.  The only same sphere option is Power of Orthanc, and that card is 100% sideboard for nasty quest conditions -- even if there was a good discarding payoff, you wouldn't pay 2 doomed to trigger it when the encounter deck is looming, and absent nasty quest conditions you'd never want it taking space in your deck.

 

It's not impossible that one of those would trigger -- a Power of Orthanc to get rid of a nasty condition for Deck 1 would allow an unafflicted Deck 2 to discard, a dwarf deck (or limited pool) might play Miner for its stats, and Athelas could be used to heal someone who just happened to have Favor of the Lady attached -- but those cases are going to be even rarer than attachment-hate quests, because the payoff isn't worth discarding intentionally anyway.

 

I'm not opposed in principle to a benefit-from-discarding item that can be triggered by attachment hate, which could make a useful sideboard card for certain quests.  But that's pretty niche, and putting it on Favor of the Lady makes no sense to me.

 

I don't like "you" for cards placed in the staging area, since attachments there are not controlled by a particular player.  I think "each player" or "first player" are better choices for player benefit.  All location attachments that currently grant singular benefits do so to the first player, why change for Ever my Heart Rises?

 

You're right about Lure of Moria, and at 3 spirit Lure of Moria would be strictly better.  With that said, this *also* readies all Rohan characters everywhere, and 2-spirit is cheaper than 3 leadership IMO.  The questing successfully does differentiate and justify the lower cost, but it's an easily met hurdle, so I like your We Do Not Sleep better than Lure of Moria.  Dwarves do have a bigger tribe than Rohan, but Rohan can also expand their ranks to Gondor (and vice versa) with a 0-cost event.  In any case, your event is worlds better than the ridiculously expensive current version of We Do Not Sleep.

Lore heroes:

 

Lore Glorfindel -- much more powerful, one time death-avoidance and free healing, coupled with the changes to SpGlorfindel, could make this the more popular of the two.  I like it, I don't think LoGlorfindel is a bad hero, just a thoroughly overshadowed one.  I do find it funny that neither LoGlorfindel nor Elrond hero have the Healer trait, though there's no room for it.

 

Mirlonde -- Mirlonde as is is a servicable hero within her niche, as 5 threat cost for her stats is great value in mono-lore, even if she's otherwise unexciting.  Expanding her discount to silvan heroes makes her equally serviceable in a wider variety of builds, which I like -- but that ability is bonkers in a Silvan deck, especially for a 5-threat hero who doesn't totally stink.  Maybe if she readied a Silvan *ally* instead?  I do like that she now has scout.

 

Bilbo -- Much more powerful.  Half a Beravor without the exhaustion, and the upgrade to 2 wp is a big deal for such a fragile defender.  A very good hero at seven threat, though not so powerful that I think he needs to be at 8.

## 50 [dalestephenson on September 24, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/230661-im-back-with-a-whole-load-of-reworked-stuff/?do=findComment&comment=2428324)

Lore allies:

 

Gildor Inglorion: You're right that his original ability (requiring exhaustion) is a poor match for his high cost and hefty stats.  I like his original ability better than Imaldris Stargazer, but the cost is prohibitive.  Being able to play from the discard is a nice Noldor nod, as is his enters play ability.  Yet I wish Gildor had an ongoing ability to make him more interesting once in play.  If his original ability were weaker, but didn't require exhaustion I think he'd be better.  Like a living Wizard Pipe.

 

Bombur:  a generic -2 threat instead of generic -1, with unlimited underground...  I think this makes Bombur more generally useful, but less likely to see use.  Before Bombur actually could be cost-justified in underground-heavy quests that could make him effectively contribute 3-5 to the quest.  But the revised version gives him a max of 2, if there's a location, which is a tough sell for 3-cost.  (Yes, he's a 2/3 defender, but as you know I think of a 2/3 ally as a two-hit chump.) Ghan-Buri-Ghan can *eliminate* a location's threat for two resources with a bonus discard ability.  Sure Bombur's a dwarf, but as an expensive dwarf he's not a get-to-five asset, and as a 0-wp 0-attack ally he's not a prime Dain target either.

 

But given the precedent of Ghan-Buri-Ghan, maybe at 3 cost he could be a mini-Argalad for locations.  His exhaust ability could reduce a location's threat *by his defense*, and add 1 progress to it if it got to 0 threat.  Now that'd be worth three cost, and also justify putting a couple Ring Mail on him to turn him into a decent defender.

 

Master of Lore -- being able to reduce Gondor as well as Lore is surely an enhancement to the poor nerfed fellow, and the attack/defense restriction isn't costly for someone with so little ability at either.  My question -- why retain the minimum cost of 1?  Since it only works once, what's the problem with reducing a 1-cost to zero?  That's a hold-over from the pre-errata days that no longer serves a purpose, IMO.

 

Daughter of Nimrodel -- being able to heal a character instead of just a hero and having 2 wp to quest with makes her an alternative to Warden of Healing, which she isn't now.  Leaves play ability is gravy, but I like the Silvan synergy.

 

Ravenhill Scout -- I like this change.  Progress moving can be situationally useful, but not worth exhaustion on a 3-cost who has no real other functionality.  Making it a quest side effect and giving him 2 wp when it whiffs makes him viable, and far from overpowered.

 

Erebor Hammersmith -- making his ability "enters play" is a modest enhancement, but definitely worthwhile.

## 51 [dalestephenson on September 24, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/230661-im-back-with-a-whole-load-of-reworked-stuff/?do=findComment&comment=2428352)

Lore attachments:

 

Asfaloth -- making it give two progress for everybody, but use a restricted slot except with Glorfindel, is a nice compromise.  The current one isn't worth the cost on anyone but Glorfindel.  Since your new version also requires questing to place progress (weaker, but thematic), the restricted slot is less likely to sting.

 

Burning Brand -- major nerf, taking a restricted slot (which defenders want), and more importantly exhausting to cancel the shadow.  However, major enhancement in not requiring lore!  I think this is a good design, but man I would hate the nerf, because nothing makes me happier than tossing shadow cards repeatedly from a branded-defender with action advantage.  Good riddance, stupid annoying shadows!  However, because of the lore requirement I would happily play this card, with a different name, as a 2-cost restricted tactics attachment.

 

Another nerf is restricting it to heroes instead of characters.  Bad enough that all the shadow-discarders want heroes.  I actually think it's a shame that most attachments are hero-restricted, and would prefer if (non-resource) hero attachments instead said "attach to a unique character".

 

Dark Knowledge -- aside from the limit 1, the ability to discard for a resource makes this card much more powerful and attractive.  Removing the -1 wp loses the thematic link to suffering from "dark knowledge", though.  Thematically, how about raising threat by 2 for the optional discard instead of using a resource?

 

Love of Tales -- Limit 1 for this errata victim isn't bad, especially with the enhancement of making it available to any hero.  But 1 cost kills this card, which after the errata is usually a coaster at 0 cost.

## 52 [dalestephenson on September 24, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/230661-im-back-with-a-whole-load-of-reworked-stuff/?do=findComment&comment=2428373)

Lore events:

 

Beorn's Hospitality -- making it effectively a monosphere 3-cost and healing every character instead of just the heroes are both positive changes.  Now makes it a usable monosphere card instead of a permanent coaster.

 

Lore of Imaldris -- cheaper and (with healer exhaustion) providing condition removal both make this card better, but also make it near-identical to Athelas in the condition removal case.  Is there a good way to make them more distinct?  I think a 1-cost Lore event capable of removing conditions would fill a need.

 

Radagast's Cunning -- blanking enemy text for the rest of the phase is a nice enhancement, and I don't think overpowered, since most of the non-immune text on enemies is either "when revealed" or relevant to something other than the quest phase.  It'd be more interesting if it weren't a quest action and you could use it in the encounter or combat phases for the blanking effect, but then it would step on the toes of Revealed in Wrath.

 

Secret Path -- like above, blanking is a nice enhancement, even though most of the location text is when revealed or relevant outside the quest phase.  Making this one not a quest action would make it more flexible again, though this time it'd step on the toes of the travel cards.

 

Word of Command -- Doomed 1 is cheaper than having to exhaust an Istari for hero Gandalf (generally), but less compelling with the Istari allies.  I prefer the current version.  Istari is misspelled on the card.

 

Infighting -- two enemies under engagement cost, move damage and administer a total of 3 direct damage to two enemies?  The original infighting is unusable, but this would be a staple in any deck that might find itself in this situation (which given the requirement of both being under engagement cost, won't be trivial to set up.)

 

Ancestral Knowledge -- replacing underground/dark bonus with a hero bonus is reasonable considering your war on traits in enemies and locations.

 

Gandalf's Search -- 0-cost search of ten for questing successfully?  Lore staple.  The original is ludicrously bad, but I'd removal Daeron's Runes if I had to to make room for this card.  Maybe it should require an Istari in play?

Leadership allies:

 

Son of Arnor -- Slightly enhanced stats and +engagement boost are both welcome for what's currently a sideboardish card.

 

Longbeard Orc Slayer -- Being able to injure something besides orcs, and having 1 wp, are both welcome for such an expensive ally.  However, in an orc-heavy quest being able to damage all orcs everywhere is more useful than damaging one player's engaged enemies.  I'd like it better if he did 2 damage to an enemy, and 1 damage to all other enemies that share a trait with that enemy.

 

Keen Eyed Took -- permanent raise to engagement cost of engaged enemies makes this card a real asset to a hobbit deck.  Well done.

 

Brok Ironfist -- lower cost and discount for replacing destroyed dwarf characters makes this a vast improvement on the original.  This card is playable.

 

Dunedain Wanderer -- still too expensive to play outside secrecy, but at least he's a better value inside it.

 

Silverlode Archer -- leaves play resource makes retrieving him less painful for a Silvan deck.  I like it.

 

Guard of the Citadel -- love the change here.  With a pure-Gondor lineup a decent defender for 2, and a solid defender with Raiment.  I like thematic boosts.

 

Dunedain Watcher -- the wp boost is welcome, since I only use her for expensive shadow removal and she quests until needed.  Allowing her to be an emergency feint in valour is a nice option without being overpowered at all.

 

Leadership attachments:

 

Steward of Gondor -- interesting nerf.  It's certainly more flavorful for it to only give its full resource load to Gondor/noble heroes, of which there are plenty, and not to grant Gondor trait.  Coming into play exhausted is also a major nerf, but the reduction to one resource actually makes this slightly better than the original in a tri-sphere deck with a noble/gondor intended recipient.  I think this is a better and more interesting card, though I'm certainly not going to print it out to replace the original!

 

Sword that was Broken -- like restricting to Noldor/Dunedain, but don't like losing the connection to Aragorn, I'd reverse the original and give Aragorn the sphere.  Requiring questing for the +1 wp is a sore blow to Loragon and Tactigorn, and so is using a restricted slot.  The questing requirement also makes it particularly attractive to Noldor with LoV.  I'd drop the questing requirement, restrict it to Dunedain, drop the restricted if on Aragorn, and only give leadership resource to Aragorn.

 

Celebrian's Stone -- I like a lot that restricted is gone.  Like the others, I'd restrict the sphere granting to Aragorn.  The discard effect for duplicates here is better than for Barahir, mostly because the card itself is good enough to justify playing.

Here is what sense it makes to me: There was a strong argument floating around that willpower costs more than other stats, that's why dunedain quest and favor of the lady are 2 resources for 1 wp. I had to restrict that +1 wp for questing to justify the price reduction to 1 to make it viable. However, a little additional kick won't hurt the card, and in a spheric situation in vacuum where you reveal that attachment discarding treachery/shadow card, and you have both favor of the lady and almost any other attachment in the game - what are you going to discard? The response to self-discarding is not supposed to be the selling point, it's supposed to be a nice bonus in case something happens, which it is.

 

But attachments in the staging area controlled by the player who played them. Or did I missed the ruling? Is it in the FAQ? Also, while speaking of those "first player effects" - I think they suck, to be honest. It takes away the choice, and would I rework them, the players would choose a player to draw 3 cards from Ancient Mathom. to gain 3 resources from Ranger's Cache, etc.

 

 

> Damrod: By increasing his stats (and not reducing his cost instead), all you've done is made sure that his ability gets used even less.

The point was not to increase the frequency of his triggers, but to make the ridiculously overpriced self-discarding ally to become worth his buck. But you have me a neat little idea, which I will include in the next update.

 

 

> Dislike the new Keeping Count. Just saw it give +6 attack to Boromir in my last game, so not really wanting a change.

I changed it not because it is cannot be useful, but because it is tideous and overburdening.

Bombur - you seem to miss the part where he can remain ready until all encounter cards are revealed, and then decide if his threat reduction is needed or would you rather use him in combat. That itself is a powerful feat.

 

Love of Tales - I'm not sure here. Love of Tales is not unique. If you have 1 hero with LoT, you are literally refunded for any Song you play, reducing it's cost to 0. If you have 2 heroes with LoT, you net 1 resource from any Song you play, and so on. And not to mention that in multiplayer other players might easily play a Song for you.

 

Lore of Imladris - I first made a change, and then someone reminded me about Athelas. I though really hard, but aside from drawing a card for a Healer, I saw no good alternative, and drawing a card felt like it found a way into my redesigns way too often.

That card would certainly justify adding Saruman ally to my Gandalf/Elrond/Galadriel deck, and given the many search cards in it would not be hard to play.  OP.

The funny thing is that before they had the actual white council card I did my own fan card and it wasn't unlike that one, just not as OP. I made it cost twelve (instead of 3) but said the players could all pay for it as a group.

Yes, I already noticed and fixed it on an actual rework, but thanks anyway :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

The amount of changed, reworked and added cards grows pretty big. I will probably start a new thread when I reach the desired amount. Might throw in an OCTGN set for practical application into the mix.

I had to restrict that +1 wp for questing to justify the price reduction to 1 to make it viable. However, a little additional kick won't hurt the card, and in a spheric situation in vacuum where you reveal that attachment discarding treachery/shadow card, and you have both favor of the lady and almost any other attachment in the game - what are you going to discard? The response to self-discarding is not supposed to be the selling point, it's supposed to be a nice bonus in case something happens, which it is.

> But attachments in the staging area controlled by the player who played them. Or did I missed the ruling? Is it in the FAQ? Also, while speaking of those "first player effects" - I think they suck, to be honest. It takes away the choice, and would I rework them, the players would choose a player to draw 3 cards from Ancient Mathom. to gain 3 resources from Ranger's Cache, etc..

Yes, willpower costs more than other stats and is arguably more valuable than attack/defense.  Yet I never use Dunedain Quest (or Favor of the Lady) and I *do* use Dunedain Mark and Dunedain Warning.  Willpower might be more valuable, but it isn't *twice*as valuable.  I appreciate that restricting the WP to questing makes it easier to justify selling the more valuable willpower for only 1, but since willpower is used for questing 99% of the time, it's like selling a cheaper attack or defense buff by restricting its use to attacking or defending -- for ordinary use it's just cheaper, and the niche uses that I find more interesting can't use it.  So I don't like having the options restricted in the interest of make it more powerful.

 

The response to discarding is a nice bonus if it's discarded, I'm just pointing out that you'd *never* self-discard it, so it's something that only comes up in a few quests -- given your redesigns have consistently changed buffs responsive to a subset of quests (Underground, orcs, etc), it's an odd choice.  And the buff isn't good enough that I would necessarily choose that attachment in the first place.  Most of all it strikes me as a missed opportunity -- since The Lady is Galadriel, having a cool side-effect from discarding really is a good idea, and extending the discard benefit to non self-discards is a clever buff.  But it would also need a self-discarding action to be usable.

 

AFAIK, you didn't miss a ruling on control, I've just never realized the significance of the statement on page 25 that a player controls his cards unless it's taken control of by another player (attachments) or the encounter deck (presumably quests like Carn Dum and Dol Goldur that animate cards).  It never even *occurred* to me to discard traps when a treachery made me discard attachments "I control", especially traps that are already attached to an enemy.  And since I control unattached traps, it'd be lovely if the attachment were done via Response, so I could play multiple traps into staging and not have them all attach to the first wimpy monster that comes along.  You'd think I'd have noticed that Damrod's response specifies traps "you control" -- I think it's literally the only player card that cares who controls a staging area attachment before it's discarded.

 

However, if you're going to make war on "first player" benefits and change them to "choose a player", why not do the same for Ever My Heart Rises?

Being able to commit after cards are revealed *can be* powerful, since it can help you avoid overquesting, avoid treachery damage related to questing, and make you available for combat or exhausting abilities.  But the power is directly related to the *impact* the character can make on those things.  Bombur has a 0-2 impact on questing, so not likely to make much difference for overquesting.  With 3 hp, he's not fragile when questing.  And with a 1/2/3 stat line, he's not that useful for combat (IMO).  It's a benefit, but hardly enough of a benefit to make him comparable to Ghan-Buri-Ghan who is *cheaper*.  However, I did miss that you had upgraded his attack to 1, which at least makes him a combat asset in a Dain deck.

 

Yes, Love of Tales becomes "free" with the first song you played.  However, the reason the *existing* Love of Tales is unpopular (outside of purpose-built song decks) at cost *zero* is because songs aren't played often enough to justify the deck space.  Love of Tales was a coaster that could be abused in a specially-built deck, then received a nerf to limit its benefit -- and you've made it strictly worse.  In a thread where you've made so many cards I never play worth consideration or even *demanding* consideration, you've taken a card I never play and made it even more unattractive.  Given the exhaustion and limit 1, why did you think it was necessary?

 

I'll admit for Lore of Imaldris I couldn't think of a good way to retain conditional removal while making it less similar to Athelas.  Maybe something like "Any hero may pay a resource to discard an attached condition", since conditions generally still allow resource collection.

Leadership events:

 

Rear Guard:  doomed 1 and ally discard for hero buffs -- flavorful and useful, and the doomed effect is both thematic and justifies the large multiplayer impact.  I like it.

 

Taking Initiative:  abandons the original mechanism, which since it was such a dud is small loss.  But this strikes me as way too powerful for a free card in a hobbit/ranger deck.  When it triggers -- and in a hobbit deck it won't be hard to trigger, especially with the changes you've made to Keen-Eyed-Took, it's more powerful than Swift Strike, a 2-cost tactics event.

 

Dawn Take You All:  I like that you've got rid of the "facedown" shadow restriction.  It's the faceup shadows that you *know* need discarded!  Still, given a 1 + 1 doom cost, using it on a single shadow (probably facedown) still seems too expensive to me, though the Valour ability is nice.

 

Sneak Attack: An enhanced staple, though since you've nerfed the mighty Gandalf/Sneak Attack combo, the enhancement is needed to keep it a staple.  All the leaves play you've added to Silvans will enhance non-Gandalf sneak attack also.

 

Fresh Tracks: Adding the 50 engagement check makes the card more usable, especially in the right sort of deck.  I like it.

The main point - if I go to that war. If I get enough fitting images, then I just might do that.

 

The thing is - not much can be done for Love of Tales, and the main reason is that there are no Lore songs, and neutral songs just give resource icons most of the time. And in that sense I buffed Love of Tales, since now it can be attached to a hero of any sphere. Limit 1 is necessary because in multiplayer, lets say 3 players, if you got all your heroes outfitted with Love of Tales, if any other player plays a Song (which all cost 1 except for that one which costs 0), you get +3 resources out of the thin air. Without need to exhaust, lets for the sake of argument that player has 3 songs, he plays them, spending all 3 resources he collected that round, and you get 9 resoruces out of it, plus 3 you've collected during the resoruce phase.

 

Swift Strike doesn't have conditions like specific hero traits, or engagement cost higher than your threat, nor does it triggers upon enemy engagement, so you can play it even on an enemy that is already engaged with you. Swift Strike is weak in it's own merit and I'm desperately trying to come with a solution to buff it not just by +1 damage from warriors, but at the moment I don't know one yet.

I did miss that your version lifted the restriction for Lore heroes only.  But given that Love of Tales isn't generally used for free on Lore heroes, lifting that restriction doesn't make it worth paying 1 on non-Lore heroes.

 

Is the main reason Love of Tales isn't used is because there are no Lore songs and neutral songs just give resource icons most of the time?  No, the main reason is that there aren't that many songs that are worth playing multiple times - and while Lore songs don't exist, the only song *fetcher* is in Lore, which makes songs more attractive in a deck with lore, independent of Love of Tales.

 

Number of Lore decks: 1539

Number with Rivendell Minstrel: 131

Number with Love of Tales: 45

 

Song of Kings: 160 (99 with Lore)

Song of Wisdom: 232 (191 with Lore)

Song of Travel: 210 (121 with Lore)

Song of Battle: 159 (84 with Lore)

Song of Mocking: 28 (16 with Lore)

Song of Earendil: 72 (49 with Lore)

Durin's Song: 78 (49 with Lore)

Lay of Nimrodel:  32 (8 with Lore)

Fall of Gil-Galad: 17 (12 with Lore)

O Lorien: 88 (58 with Lore)

The Day's Rising: 85 (19 with Lore)

Hope Rekindled: 15 (7 with Lore)

Tale of Tinuviel: 69 (30 with Lore)

To the Sea! To the Sea!:  89 (66 with Lore)

 

As you can see, Lore is present in a healthy percentage of the decks with songs in them, but it's not popular even as a one off, even free.  Rivendell Minstrel is three times more popular, although there are better values for your questing dollar -- because of the nature of how songs are used.  Most of them are ones you want to play ASAP and once, not ones that you want to play throughout the game.  The four cards that are of that type just aren't popular enough for Love of Tales to pay off very often.  Making Love of Tales available to non-Lore heroes doesn't change that.

 

With Love of Tales changed to non-Lore heroes, the "Limit 1" is pointless -- and honestly, it's pretty pointless for the original and is one of the reason that it is a coaster.  The *exhaustion* cost is necessary to prevent getting unlimited resources in a deck contrived for playing songs repeatedly without regard to their utility, but with the exhaustion in place the limit is pointless and unnecessary.

 

Whether the exhaustion is necessary in an "ordinary" multiplayer setting is less clear -- I personally think not.  Let's say your revised Love of Tales doesn't exhaust and isn't limit 1.  I put all three in my deck on my heroes, some other player plays three songs and I get *9* resources in a single turn from them.  Woohoo!  Overpowered city, right?

 

Except it's hard to imagine an ordinary multiplayer game where another player would spend his turn playing three songs at the point of the game where I've already got all my Love of Tales out.  What possible combination of songs would be useful in planning at that point in the game?  This isn't something that's going to naturally happen.

 

And while resources materialized at of "thin air" in this instance, it wasn't really thin air -- I spent three precious deck slots on Love of Tales, I drew them instead of some other card, and I played all three at a cost of 3 resources.  Like money, the value of resources isn't constant through time -- early resources are more precious than late resources, but at 1-cost Love of Tales needs you to sink precious resources early so you take advantage of the rare song play later.  It's a non-starter at 1 cost.  (The nerfed Master of Lore has a similar problem -- over time it will still pay your investment back, but it's expensive early when you can least afford it.)

 

It's not attractive at 0-cost, either.  Like many other unloved 0-cost cards, free isn't really free when you have it taking space in your deck.  Even a 0-cost card needs to be obviously useful for your deck to justify drawing it instead of a more powerful 1-cost card.

 

So the obvious solution to fix weak 0-cost cards is this -- draw a card as part of the effect, making them *truly* free by removing the deck slot cost, at least for deckbuilders who don't have their heart set on having exactly 50 cards.  This would at least make your revised Love of Tales worth playing *if* it were still 0-cost.  If you have your heart set on 1-cost for them, that's not enough, but it might be if you combined in with this -- make Love of Tales *itself* a song.  That way the second copy becomes free and the third copy becomes net-one positive.

Add "and ready the defending character" to Swift Strike.

My initial Swift Strike rework had a valour trigger that did more damage and readied the defending character, but I removed it because I felt like I was adding valor for the sake of valor.

 

And I honestly don't know what's your gripe with the Love of Tales. The way I redone it, is by looking out into the future for potential new songs. As I said already, there is not much to be done about it now, and leaving it this way can hurt future songs design.

Hey, adding valour for the sake of valour isn't such a bad thing.  The cardpool needs more Valour.  I just think that 2 direct damage + defender ready isn't overpowered for 2-cost tactics.  I may be wrong.

 

What's my gripe with Love of Tales?  I thought I elaborated on that at great length.  But here's the summary version:

 

1) The original, un-errated version wasn't worth playing except in a deck specifically designed to generate unlimited resources.

2) The Errataed version isn't worth playing at all, despite being free.

3) The slight improvement to its powers you made don't come close to justifying a 1-cost, they wouldn't even justify it if it were still 0-cost.  You took a coaster and made it worse.

 

That's my gripe.  Now it's true that more songs may come in the future and make Love of Tales a totally awesome card in the future, such that a 1-cost is necessary to curtail the awesome power of this attachment that can generate up to 1 resource per turn!  But today is not that day.  And I don't think the reason we haven't seen a flood of awesome song events is because the designers are saying to themselves, "Hey, we can't make this cool event a song.  That would totally make Love of Tales OP.  If only we had priced it at one!"

 

Most of your cards take less popular cards and make them significantly better.  A few of your cards take popular and powerful cards and make them arguably weaker, for balance and/or thematic reasons.  I have no clue how it is that Love of Tales, with its errata, found itself in the second category instead of the first.

 

Now, counterquestion -- what's your problem with my proposed enhancement to your 1-cost, limit-1, exhausting Love of Tales, by making it draw a card when played and making it be a "Song" itself?  How exactly would making it playable now reduce the design space for future songs?

I do use Love of Tales even after errata (example: http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/2200/arrows-from-the-trees-1.0) [http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/2200/arrows-from-the-trees-1.0)]

I had an idea based off this reddit post: https://www.reddit.com/r/lotrlcg/comments/55kg06/any_radagasts_cunning_and_secret_paths_users_here/ [https://www.reddit.com/r/lotrlcg/comments/55kg06/any_radagasts_cunning_and_secret_paths_users_here/]

 

as well as the fact that Fresh Tracks (even in your reworked form John) is still a very niche card and situational card albeit way better than the original. 

What if Radagasts Cunning and Fresh Tracks were one card...?

Fresh Tracks
1 cost Leadership Event.
Action: Exhaust a Ranger character you control to deal 1 damage to an enemy in the staging area. That enemy is considered to have 50 Engagement cost and does not contribute its threat to the staging area until the end of the round.

 

OR

Fresh Tracks

1 cost Leadership Event.
Response: After an enemy is added to the staging area, deal 1 damage to that enemy. That enemy gets -2 threat and is considered to have 50 engagement cost until the end of the round.

What do you think John? I like the first one better even though it changes the card quite a bit and effects an enemy already in staging instead of one being revealed during staging. I think it is thematic that you exhaust a ranger (rangers following the fresh tracks of enemies) and makes even more sense that the enemy is already in play because you are tracking its movements as it tries to pursue or find you (engage). This would still help stop enemies engaging or with "surprise" effects when the enemy engagement cost needs to be higher than your threat. It also gives a nice little boost to questing like Radagasts Cunning by dropping the enemies threat or by reducing it to zero until the end of the round. Maybe both effects at once for one cost and exhausting a ranger is a bit too good especially on nastier foes as you are getting in a point of damage, reducing their threat (from potentially 3 or 4 to zero) and not having to engage them for a round/getting bonuses against them in combat because of your threat being lower than their engagement.

 

Just a thought really because Radagasts Cunning is so average and fresh tracks is so situational/specific.

It's an awesome solution, however it unfortunately goes against the core concept of the project: I intend to revitalize cards, and melding them together is whole other thing. If Radagast's Cunning and Hidden Paths are still subpar even with blank effect, I'll strive to find a way to improve them until they aren't. As for Fresh Tracks themselves, they sure can take some more nourishment, and I think I know what might work now.
