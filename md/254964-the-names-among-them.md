preview article up.   There is a slight error, Guthwine is not from the Morgul Vale,  I'm guessing it's Mountain of Fire.   Elladan and Elrohir allies.   Doesnt look like we get an Eomer ally though,   sad.

I think most people given a choice between a new hero version and an ally version would take the hero.

We get a new Eomer hero, though. Leadership, with the ability to attack into the staging area, making Fastred a little better since we're no longer completely dependent on Dunhere or events to make him work. New Elfhelm ally (Tactics), too.

Guthwine makes Tactics Eomer huge, and really helps make Firefoot more interesting.

I want to go the other way with it and put Firefoot (and Guthwine) on the new Leadership Eomer.  Sure it's combo-y, but use Fastred to bounce a weak enemy into the staging area, then when you go to quest you kill it with Eomer, and are then able to put direct damage on something engaged with you.  Maybe something big that you couldn't kill the turn before.

most people maybe,  but not me.   I would have preferred an ally Eomer, since Rohan already has quite a few strong heros.

Wow. Just wow. I'm already thinking through the implications of Eomer and Fastred together. An Eomer, Fastred and Dunhere deck would lack questing power, but there are a bunch of allies that can help with that in Spirit. Pair it with a good questing deck across the table...

Or, if you want some real Rohan thematic stuff going on, run a SpTheoden, Dunhere, TaEowyn deck on one side of the table with a LdEomer, Elfhelm, Fastred deck on the other. Use some songs to give Eomer a spirit icon and a tactics icon for the stat boosts (and resource smoothing while you're at it). And while you're doing songs, give Fastred a Ld Icon so that he can take Armored Destrier and get +1 Defense while he's doing so. The +1 boost to Willpower from Elfhelm also makes him a decent target for Golden Shield. Elfhelm's stat boosts would make Theoden quite interesting, especially with Herugrim and Snowmane.

Grappling Hook should get even more mileage, especially if you're boosting Eomer's attack (well, not with Guthwine).

Speaking from the solo player persepctive and thinking of the classic Rohan swarm archetype, I'm not sure I like Éomer that much. I mean, Gúthwine is just perfect for this archetype, but in terms of Éomer I'm not sure how good he'll be in solo. With high starting threat heroes like himself, there just won't be too many enemies leftover from the previous round in the staging area, barring Fastred/Terrible to Behold type shenanigans. In solo, I just don't know if I'll use his ability often, much like all the staging area attack stuff like Battle Fury and Forth Eorlingas, both of which are pretty much binder fodder for the solo player. Hoping I'm wrong though, I really like the theme and art on this card.

## 11 [pmdoug on July 26, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/254964-the-names-among-them/?do=findComment&comment=2897974)

Hama loves Guthwine, that's for sure.  

Helm! Helm! and Ride to Ruin should be much easier to use with T Elfhelm and Guthwine. Still taxes your hand and resources quite a bit, but less so than before.

Is Elfhelm the first Ally to have cards in 3 different spheres? If you count the hero, there's an Elfhelm in every sphere. Not even Aragorn gets that. Wonder why they thought Elfhelm was important enough to merit that.

EDIT: Of course there isn't a lore Elfhelm,  and I'm an idiot who can't count

I don't think there's a Lore Elfhelm.

Ooh, I love all the support staging area Rohan has been getting lately. I always liked that archetype, I just couldn't ever seem to get it to work.

I like that there's not a clear "ideal" lineup for this archetype: I want Dunhere, Eomer, and Fastred, but then I'm missing out on some of the Tactics cards like Spear of the Mark. And ideally I'd like to make use of the bonuses that hero Elfhelm can grant... Lots of new deck ideas to try out now!

You're right. I don't know where I got that from. I was thinking we already had 3 versions, and i don't know how I got there.

I'll still surprised they chose Elfhelm instead of another prominent Rohirrim, but not as much so

Dunhere with Rohan warhorse/spear of the mark and the Elfhelm boost would be a pretty decent target for battle fury. Give him a song of battle with TaTheoden on the board and he's attacking for 6 in the staging area and then questing for 3. Not bad at all.

TaTheoden only affects characters with a printed Tactics icon, unfortunately, so he wouldn't help out Dunhere sadly.

But you could use Windfola instead of Rohan Warhorse to get the extra +1 willpower instead. At that point, you might be better off using Herugrim than Spear of the Mark, too. Sounds like an Elfhelm / Dunhere / TaEowyn deck might be in order...

It's funny that this pack is getting me to think about all kinds of decks I want to build that don't use any new cards from The Mountain of Fire at all.

I've tried a few Rohan decks, and although they're always pretty good at combat, you just can't generate enough willpower in high threat quests.

But he seems to be Eomer's second in command, as he is chosen to ambush the army that occupied Cair Andros. I Think he deserves a new ally version.

That's been my experience as well. I've been running a Rohan deck in a pair through the saga, and oddly enough it has been the Rohan deck that has been doing all the fighting, and until the last saga box that deck as 2/3 spirit, 1/3 tactics. It can quest, no doubt, but I've not quite managed to get the mental questing that you can manage with other deck types going with Rohan, maybe because they're more sacrificial in their nature and so don't build a big board state. Always had great success pairing Rohan with a solid questing deck though.

On the released cards, the new Eomer is very shiny. I recently discovered that Argalad is an amazing double-quester (quest + exhaust to reduce an enemy's threat) and Eomer provides this ability also. It's *very* powerful. It is also good to see support for the staging area attack style decks. All fun!

## 21 [Rouxxor on July 26, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/254964-the-names-among-them/?do=findComment&comment=2898351)

I prefer to play Rohan with a lot of quester and with only one ally that die each turn: Eomund. So everyone untap and can attack. There is nothing wrong about being reliable to Eomund since you can search for Eomund within 10 cards with the event (mustering the rohirrim?). Now with this attachment you also can bring it back each turn in hand and do it again.

I haven't tried it, but at first glance it still looks low on WP even with Eowyn - for a solo deck anyway. I'd probably want to stick ally Faramir in there to try and boost WP all round.

Um, Battle-fury has nothing to do with attacking the staging area though?

## 24 [Gizlivadi on July 26, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/254964-the-names-among-them/?do=findComment&comment=2898916)

Pocketwraith, you're right, I got confused. Still, I'm not sure how viable the whole staging area attack thing is in solo without running Fastred (my ideal thematic Rohan lineup is Eowyn, Theoden and Eomer), though I am open to trying him in the deck, as long as I get Guthwine on him ASAP, the real gem here for the classic Rohan deck.

## 25 [John Constantine on July 26, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/254964-the-names-among-them/?do=findComment&comment=2898958)

They made it again. A 1 willpower hero with on-quest-commitment effect, now he has to pay up too. Not sure, not sure. Many enemies boast significant amounts of health/defense, and rarely stick in the staging too. Committing his whopping 1 wp to the quest would be a cost enough for his reponse to me. You need to setup heavy for this to work, and then you need to pay 1 each time on top of it. Both the gift and the curse of this situation is that he is leadship, which means that he has access to resource acceleration (good for paying the cost), but not that much keeping in the staging area potential.

My take on the new cards:

Leadership Eomer's ability is only good with enemies in the staging area, so aside from Fastred and Late Adventurer may be a rare thing.  His questing value is low, so unless he can eliminate an enemy in staging it's unlikely to be used.  With 3 attack and 10 threat he matches Amarthiul for the cheapest attacking hero in Leadership, so even if his ability rarely kicks in he's still a decent hero for the sphere.  Rohan doesn't have many leadership allies, so I ordinarily wouldn't put him in a Rohan deck...

However, Guthwine is awesome in a Rohan deck, enough so to justify leadership sphere for solo Rohan.  However, I think Theodred/SpTheoden/Eomer would make a better base.

Tactics Elfhelm's ability makes him a when-needed chump or source of 1 wp or 2 attack, but he's not that exciting at full price and his spirit cousin is.  I don't see him as a Rohan deck guy, I see him as a splash guy in decks with Rohan heroes used for utility rather than trait, and there's a lot in that category (Theodred, Grima, Eowyn etc.) . He combos especially well with TaEomer and LeImrahil, though the later is non-Rohan.

The new Elfhelm is awesome! He's like a Ranger of Cardolan but with more windows to jump him out. his high printed cost could actually be a benefit if you use him with A Very Good Tale.

## 28 [dalestephenson on July 26, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/254964-the-names-among-them/?do=findComment&comment=2899077)

True, excellent with Very Good Tale.  Ranger of Cardolan is a good comp, though I think more attractive at full price -- non-unique, neutral resources, and better willpower.

## 29 [sappidus on July 26, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/254964-the-names-among-them/?do=findComment&comment=2899239)

Another point for the Ranger of Cardolan is that you can use his attack or defense stat when you pop him in and, assuming he survives, still AVGT with him in the refresh phase before he disappears. Not so easy with Elfhelm. Still, his timing flexibility is indeed nice.

I don't think he'll topple Dunhere as the staging area attack king, but I could see some potential in him riding Firefoot and killing both a staging area enemy and an engaged enemy in one blow. He's also the best case for using Grappling Hook we've seen so far.

## 31 [Onidsen on July 27, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/254964-the-names-among-them/?do=findComment&comment=2900879)

Just realized that Eomer has an interesting interaction with Battle-Fury. Pay your 1 tactics resource, get an attack on an enemy engaged with you (let's assume Firefight/Spear of the Mark for 6 attack against an enemy engaged and 7 in the staging area). Then somebody on the table pays a spirit resource, and Eomer commits to the quest, getting a second attack at 7 or so in the staging area. Two resources to attack twice and commit to the quest. Seems like an interesting combo to me. I'll have to get it on the table to see if it's worthwhile, but there might be something there.

## 32 [stimpaksam on July 28, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/254964-the-names-among-them/?do=findComment&comment=2902114)

I'm looking forward to using Leadership Eomer.  I'm a sucker for attacking enemies in the staging area. Great art too. I just wish they hadn't cropped out the part showing the sword sticking out the back of the orc...
