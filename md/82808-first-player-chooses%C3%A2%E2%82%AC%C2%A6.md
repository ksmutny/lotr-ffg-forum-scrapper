it seems to be a day of questions from me…….this one is rather simple and im 90% sure i know the answer but my OCD is making me want that last 10%

so….

when a card says 'first player must chose a character and …….. if able,

does this mean the first player only has to chose his own characters, and not 'choose anyone's character

i only ask for when the uruks make you discard a questing character's attatchment and the 1st player choses who.

so if there isnt anyone in the first player's control eligble, then nothing happens right?

If it says "the 1st player must choose a character" but doesn't specify control, any player's characters are eligible.  A good example is Dol Guldur Orcs.  Any questing character is eligible, not just questing ones.  So if the first player didn't send anyone questing, the damage still needs to go on another player's character. 

Player cards use language like "exhaust a character to do X."  In that case, the card does not specify who controls the card, so it would seem that you could exhaust another player's card to pay for yours.  But the manual states that you have to use your own resources/characters to pay costs, so this kind of language is sufficient.  Encounter cards, on the other hand, affect all players and, unless limited by the card text, any player's character is an eligible target of such effects.
