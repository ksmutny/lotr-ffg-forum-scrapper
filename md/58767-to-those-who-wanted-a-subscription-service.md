Very interesting idea, and useful. I get this service through my local game store already, and they are always spot on! FF is good to them and ships product on time every time to them so far.  Good luck finding a consistent basis in the UK Rich, it sounds like it's harder for you to get your hands on these packs on a reasonable time table.  Are you taking these guys up on their service?

im not sure with it being in a different country, its pretty messed up here...i mean khazad is in stock in maybe 25% of stores (none of which i picked to pre order funnily enough) and the other 75% either have it on order or dont have it at all....im not sure if it would even work out better.......perhaps next time i sell a limb i'll put a forward order in and find out lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif]  i would use a local store but im i havnt found one thats within 200 miles yet.......though if any north englanders want to shout up with one im listening

haha.....very kind of you.....i dont know if you're kidding or not, but that would seem alot like me using you just to get packs quicker! its not all bad though...im pre ordered up to watcher in the water, ill say this about the store i use, they may not get them in really quick, but they give you the choice to pre order packs quicker than anywhere else ive found

 I've just got into LotR LCG and bought all the expansion packs from Patriot Games in Sheffield.  But I've been online to try and pre-order the next cycle.  I've pre-ordered them from OGGames.co.uk and just wondered if anyone else had any experience of how on the ball they are with getting FF games in stock on time?

i ordered hunt for gollum off them, and they were pretty good, i noticed that they had khazad in around the same time as most other places, when i ordered HFG however, it was delayed by about a fortnight before being sent out, i cant remember why....i use maelstrom now, they usually have them to pre order before anywhere else

I really have no idea why FFG do nto set this up.. I mean having a exact number of pre-order units and a solid predicted income each month could do nothing but be good for them..

 

I would subscribe to Arkham, CoC, LoTR, Star Wars instantly.

Probably because all of us going into our FLGS every month means we are exposed to more of their games and people who play them. They need strong FLGS to grow the gaming community.

assuming you have a FLGS! thank god for the internet. a subscription service would be great for me....i never seem to have money when packs are released so im stuck having to pre-order them piece by piece....as long as i get my fix gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]

[With so many options for forum software, IDK why this forum is so bad.]

Rich, if you have a Travelling Man near you, they definitely got Khazad-dum in and I know they got earlier packs. They have kept packs aside for me in the Manchester store, and I tend to send messages to them via Twitter. I have used a few ebay sellers who have physical shops to get packs and the ones I have used have been 100% reliable. I can PM you names if you want. Use the same 2-3 shops.

thanks for the info, im in cumbria so the nearest is newcastle, so thats still a hundred or so miles away, saying that i sometimes go to the shopping centre there, so ill be sure to check travelling man out! im already pre ordered on a couple of the packs and maelstrom games seemed to be doing a good job, but drop me a pm if you want with those names....im more looking for a place i can physically go to, which isnt really feasible out here in the sticks gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]

ps this forum software baffles me, it automatically published this post before i clicked it, and then said there were new posts avaiable...which were mine!
