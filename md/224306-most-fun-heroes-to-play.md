1. Boromir (Tactics)

2. Elrond

3. Elrohir and Elladan

4. Celeborn

5. Mablung

6. Galadriel

7. Faramir (Leadership)

8. Merry (Tactics)

9. Rossiel

10. Amarthiul

 

Honorable mention in Beorn because he is just a huge bear that slaughters enemies.  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

An interesting thread.

Beorn is fun because you really have to build around him in a very different way. It is fun to find combos with a hero that is immune to player cards. Recently, the pool has been good to him, too, and Beorn is absolutely superb in some scenarios.

Tactics Boromir: it works two ways for me, either really really fun, or too good to make things boring.

Spirit Glorfindel. I enjoy immensely to make him a warrior, combine him with the above (and Dúnedain) as a super assassin (Bow, Hands, F&P, ToT).

Noldor discard style including Círdan (Arwen and another hero) with Narya.

Gandalf & Elrond with Vilya, though growing rather old now.

Celeborn & Galadriel and the Silvan mechanics, never growing old for me.

Damrod and traps, sometimes.

Leadership Boromir and the Gondor Leadership, ever lusting for support. Tactics Imrahil seems posed to help.

I would like to say Haldir & Dúnhere assassin style but I can't seem to get them working properly.

I used to like Lore Denethor and the whole spying thing but that has been a while.

Galadriel. Great sphere, range of abilities, two unique personal attachments, and ties well with two powerful archetypes.

2. Aragorn (T)

3. Dain Ironfoot

4. Frodo Baggins

I talked about this a bit after the end of the Hero Championship: https://wardenofarnor.wordpress.com/2016/01/19/power-vs-fun-in-the-hero-championship/ [https://wardenofarnor.wordpress.com/2016/01/19/power-vs-fun-in-the-hero-championship/](you have to scroll down a bit to where I go in judging on fun rather than power). I'd still stand by that top 4 list.

 

1. Beorn

2. Caldara

3. Dunhere

4. Leadership Faramir

 

Not sure how I'd fill out the rest of a top 10 though.

Glorfindel (s) - Feels great having him Standing against the shadow, taking archery damage for the Team and finally cutting orcs in half.

Gandalf - SO. MANY. TOYS.

Merry (t) - Do you want your sneak attacked beorn to murder an army?

Elrond - Damage? What damage? Nice shadow effect, would be a shame if someone has a burning brand! Also take this Gildor Inglorion for free!

Aragorn (t) - Come, engage me, I have Cookies!

Arwen - Representative for Noldor :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Rossiel - I surely don't want to face THIS Card again!

Dunhere - Don't Trouble yourself, I'll come over.

Hama - Why can't I include 10 feints?

Boromir (t) - Ready? Set? GO!

 

Not 1 Leadership hero made it :o [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_ohmy.png]

Yes, it is interesting how Leadership heroes are weaker in general, I would say. I have two in my top ten but Boromir is more of a heart thing, and the great art! though I stand by his worth too. Celeborn, however, is a pure powerhouse (and so is Dáin but I never liked to play him).

## 15 [Gizlivadi on July 6, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/224306-most-fun-heroes-to-play/?do=findComment&comment=2298386)

Celeborn, Dain, Leadership Boromir, Spirit Theoden (I insanely enjoy passive tribal effects)

Amarthiúl (turning him into a beast defender is so fun)

Tactics Boromir (duh)

Galadriel (fantastic abilities, waiting to add that 4 willpower with Nenya adds a great layer of fun)

Círdan (readying 2 beast allies and buffing them with Narya is one of my definitions of fun in this game)

Elrond (with or without Vilya)

Gandalf (similar to Elrond, I love "magic bag" Vilya decks)

Treebeard (particularly with Elrond, the quintessential Lore tank)

Gríma (though maybe not as fun in multiplayer)

Erestor (drawing is a good part of the fun I have in this game)

Sam (similar case with Amarthiúl)

Elladan & Elrohir (don't really need to say, buffing and readying is my thing, and they're really thematic)

1) Aragorn (T) - Opens up so many decisions/shenanigans during the combat phase

2) Erestor - It's fun to decide which cards to play before you have to discard your hand

3) Frodo - Opens up some fun secrecy decks, and his ability can be a lifesaver

4) Treebeard - Pure shenanigans

5) Damrod & Amarthiul - Traps + Dunedain = awesome archtype

What is this, a list of worst heroes? Because you put Fatty on there when he shouldn't be.

1.  Gloin.   Come on people,  who doesn't love the engine of pain?   I mean really.  
2.  Haldir of Lorien.    2x Bow of the Galadrhim,  snipe away.
3.  Theoden (S),  because he makes Rohan kinda work.   Like instead of not at all.
