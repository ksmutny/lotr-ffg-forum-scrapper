So i bougth this guest about week ago and me and my friend played it and we had this situatation.

 

We completed stage 2b and it says: After placing the 11th progress token on snowdrifts...Caradhras becomes active location. And caradhras has that While Caradhras is active location, guesting charecters get -1 willpower.

 

So here is my guestion: Does my hero Theodred die because he is still guesting or am i already finished guest phase and then Theodred wouldnt be anymore guesting charecter and he would survive?

 

Oh and i have another one guestion about same guest, so if example northern tracker would have been guested so much that caradhras would leave as an explored location, does i still have to complete it again, when i have been completed stage 2b?

Good question, as I'm not too sure really.

Here are the 2 options that make me wonder which is right:

 

-You finished the questing phase by placing the progress tokens right?

Then questing should be over and the questing characters are just exhausted, not questing, and shouldn't get -1.

 

-On the other hand, quest resolvement (going from 2b to 3b for example) is "immediate" and it may well happen before the quest phase is over, and your characters will get -1.

 

I'd like to know which scenario is right.

Edit: sorry, misread your 2nd question.

 

The quest states only "becomes the active location"

It does not state where to pluck it from, so I'd say yes.

Bad news:

 

1. Theodred dies. You are still in quest phase, so each character in quest gets -1

2. Caradhras return to play by the effect of quest card, even if you explored it. The best idea is explore but only almost all. And then, it would be easier.

Characters are considered questing until the end of the questing phase.

It's good if you are playing thalin, but in case of Caradhras, it does hurt a bit.

 

Answer from Caleb says it should become the active location even if in victory display because it's a forced effect and cards in victory display are not removed from the game. Expect cries and tears when playing Nightmare Emyn Muil.

In the example above, Theodred gets a -1 from Caradhras and dies... but what if you had Faramir along on the quest to boost his willpower to 2?  I guess the question is does his willpower go up before it goes down (and he lives) or does it go down before it goes up (and he dies)?

Faramir increase the willpower (until the end of the phase) at the time that Faramir is exhausted.  So it would go something like this:

Theodred exhausted to quest -- (1 willpower)

Faramir exhausted to increase willpower (Theodred now at 2)

Questing resolved, 2b cleared, Caradhras becomes active location (Theodred now at 1)

At the end of the questing phase, Theodred is no longer boosted by Faramir, but is also no longer questing, and his willpower is still 1.  He's safe for the moment.

Until Caradhras is cleared, if you want to quest with Theodred you'd need to increase his willpower with Faramir *before* committing him to the quest.
