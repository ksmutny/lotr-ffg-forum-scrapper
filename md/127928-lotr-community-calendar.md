# [LOTR Community Calendar](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/127928-lotr-community-calendar/)

Hello, all! I recently made the attempt to start up a central calendar for all LOTR LCG local/online groups looking for players. We have the forums here, and on BGG, and on Reddit, and so on, and they're fine, but I feel that a one-stop-shop in calendar format could be huge for people looking for games. 

 

The link is below, so please have a look, submit your game, hit me with some suggestions, and find some buddies to play with. 

 

Yes, I did post this on the 'Player Community' subforum and I'm sorry if this is spammy.
