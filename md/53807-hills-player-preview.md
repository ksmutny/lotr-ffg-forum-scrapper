Coming from one that will not see the package any time soon (in relativity, perhaps two or three weeks) due to regional setting, would be nice that those who are more fortunate in this matter will share their knowledge.

Plainly speaking, those of you who have got the new adventure pack (Hills of Emyn Muil), would you mind sharing? Any news appreciated here.

As far as I know, this hasn't actually been released yet. The FFG shop still has it listed as unreleased and they are still releasing previews.

I came to asking since one person said he had got it. He may be the only one but he surely was not kidding as he had reported about Brand before his preview came...

Well. i don't want to spoil too much, because it is a really graet experience to open the Adventure Pack and explore it by yourself.

But if anyone has a question write me an email : asertus(at)op.pl

Maybe in a CCG environment with random cards, but all LCG packs I've bought (CoC, LotR, W:I), I've never bought one blind, always waited for the full spoiler. No point in spending money on a pack that has only one or two cards that would find themselves in a deck. Less true with LotR since Quest and Encounter deck cards would see play. There are no Ultra Rares to get in LCGs.

I also prefer to know what is in an upcoming set. Improves the anticipation of getting to play it.Â

Gildor!!! Holy crap!

Gildor would have been an 11-threat Hero...amazing stats and the ability isn't bad either.

I really dont see the point to give Tactics a card just now that is very similar to Borne Aloft (Meneldor's Flight)... Tactics needs a lot of things but not Borne Aloft in two variations at this stage of the card pool...
