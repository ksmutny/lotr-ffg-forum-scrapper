This has been the most difficult chapter to write yet, as evidenced by the fact it is nearly 4 months overdue. But here is my narrative for the Saga Campaign I am doing covering Journey to the Crossroads. Here Frodo, Sam and Faramir find themselves in a warzone, as Boromir Captian of Gondor leads the rangers of Ithilien against the Southron hordes.
