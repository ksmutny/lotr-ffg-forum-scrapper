The fifth scenario is called Blood of Numenor.

 

There is an attachment called Blood of Numenor.

 

This cycle is doing a frikkin' lot to support monosphere decks.

 

So if I built a monosphere spirit deck, the only hero profiting from that attachment so far is Eleanor. So shouldn't there be another spirit hero that qualifies for that attachment? Without spoiling too much content, after assaulting Osgiliath the journey goes into the forests again, so a Dunedain or a Gondor native hero makes sense.

 

In this cycle we got a lore, two tactics and a leadership hero that are either Gondorian or Outlands.

 

I think all of this makes it likely that we will see a spirit Dunedain or Gondor hero. Someone who has probably a DEF value of 3. Mablung perhaps?

I'd love to have ally versions of those heros, as well as Thalin.

 

As for the hero, at this rate it's gonna be an Outlands AND monosphere booster... sick of that.

Gondor currently has 2/2/2/1 for hero distribution across the spheres (with spirit at 1).

I'm expecting a spirit hero with the Gondor Trait. I think too many choices exist to guess which it might be. (Or it could be invented by FFG - they have 3 more from the other lord of the rings game still to come).

I will be disappointed if they release a spirit hero that encourages you to be mono-spirit for Gondor though.

I don't think we'll get a spirit hero with defense 3. If Mablung is the hero I would expect something like;

Threat 8

WP 1
Attack 2
Def 1

4 HP
Gondor, Ranger.
Ranged

 

Possibly An ability to do with avoiding attacks (raise your threat by the threat of  an enemy to prevent that enemy making engagement checks this round).

Spirit hero with 3 Willpower, which always uses Willpower during questing, regardless of keyword, lol. Nah, this will be too useless.

Or some hero that you have to exhaust to keep one enemy from engaging. I'd really like to see a low threat spirit hero that is going to fuel Faramir's or Dunhere's ability.

 

WP: 1

ATT: 1

DEF: 2

HP: 3

 

Threat: 7

I'm thinking Iorlas should make his hero debut while he can with all this Gondor-themed goodness happening.

Wishful thinking I suppose, but I prefer new heroes over alternate sphere current ones.

I'm a fan of the idea for a low threat spirit Mablung that fits within the ranger theme.  The hero has got to be spirit, and i'm practically relieved that Faramir broke the trend for mono-sphere booster heroes so that this next one has the potential to be anything.  

 

if not Mablung than Halbarad, for while he would lack the gondor trait, his ranger and dunedain characteristics would still be useful.  

 

infact, really just hoping for anyone spirit/ranger.  it would be the perfect compliment (Damrod is lonely over there) to the lore cards we've received thus far in this cycle and the ranger trait seems to have a lot more interesting things going on for it at this point than gondor does

Gondor needs someone with decent willpower. How are we supposed to make the promised Gondor decks? I don't buy the one from the Second Breakfast article. Not a bad deck, surely, but Aragorn is cheating, I want a Gondor line-up. I actually want a mono-Leadership Gondor line-up. That is what we were promised to get.

 

But it will likely be a Spirit hero, given the current distribution. And it might not even be Gondor, though that would be even worse. I don't think a Spirit ranger makes much sense as all the synergies are in the sphere of Lore. Damrod is an exception, yes, but the only one, I think.

Spirit Imrahil? Sounds intrigue.... Maybe, Maybe.....who knows..? But i think it will be someone  what we not expect at all.

Someone like...... MIirlonde.

as eager as i am for Eomer i have a gut feeling we wont see him until the 3rd saga expansion box (or rather 1st two towers box).  Although if we did get him next there would be plenty of time before we would get his second version...so maybe

 

Since we dont have a clue who this next hero is (except the high likelihood of them being spirit) its easy to project our desires of practically any character who hasnt been made yet into the unmade card.  i think i'll be happy with anyone so long as it isnt a custom-made character.  Id prefer if they werent a mono-sphere booster too but i'd be able to live with if they were

Anyone think we have a possibility of seeing Lord Alcaron as the hero? (or even an objective-ally again?) On the post-victory section of the story for assault on osgiliath...

 

(CAUTION: POSSIBLE SPOILERS)

 

Lord Alcaron is featured prominently in that text as going with you (the player) and Faramir into Ithilien to track down the remaining forces of mordor.  I dont know if that would be reason enough to make a hero out of him, but it would at least be nice to have another gondor character and if they keep his objective ally stats from Amon Din he'd have a respectable 8 starting threat.  Plus even though he would be a "custom-created" character, hes been in enough of FFG's lore for this cycle that he is at least familiar to the players and seems to have a place within their vision of middle earth.  He wouldnt be my first choice but he would be an interesting one...

I like Alcaron, I think he has more reason to be an actual player card than all of the other FFG created heroes. I'd like him as a Spirit hero.

I like the way in which introduced this character in the story "Against the Shadow" - first he is the introduction to the story, then we meet him in Amon din as ally ... it would be fantastic to meet him again as a Hero or even ally in the player deck. Designers have created an interesting character that became like an integral part of the story.

Eomer would actually make sense in this cycle. He could be either Tactics or Spirit in order to provide a monosphere Rohan deck. I suspect he won't show up before a Rohan Deluxe Expansion or the first Two Towers Saga Expansion, though.

----CONTINUATION of POSSIBLE SPOILERS----

 

I just finished the Assault on Osgiliath quest this morning and really enjoyed the narrative.  However, at the end when Alcaron and Faramir are with you at the campfire and Alcaron is really gung-ho to invade Ithilien and Faramir is not, I got a certain feeling that Alcaron might actually die in either the next AP or the final one at Morgal Vale.  Faramir is very reserved and doesn't like the idea of leading a forward offensive into the forest against Sauron's forces, but Alcaron knows no bounds it seems and could perhaps be reckless.  

Anyways, that's just an idea; I guess we'll see in time.  I definitely wouldn't mind having Alcaron as an ally card, but I'm not sure about a hero.  With that said, I really like Faramir!  I crafted a mono-Lore ranger deck using Faramir, Strider, and Mirlonde (to drop the starting threat down just a bit,) and it was a blast trapping enemies and picking them off.

On a totally unrelated topic, responding to the above line-up, what was the deck you used? I find it hard to make a mono-Lore deck actually do things. It all seems nice, and Lore is really my favourite sphere, but it seems to lack resources, willpower, action advantage, just quite a few important things. But I am eager to get such a deck going...

That wouldn't surprise me either. When I read the narrative to my friend after we beat it he said the same thing. It certainly would kick up the drama and emotional factor for their custom stories! They could put his grave near Amon Din in honor of all the villagers he helped save there lol

It all seems nice, and Lore is really my favourite sphere, but it seems to lack resources, willpower, action advantage, just quite a few important things. But I am eager to get such a deck going...

 

 

This was the first time I've tinkered with making a mono-Lore deck, but I liked several of the mechanics I got going throughout my game.

 

 

To begin with, I used nearly all of the new trap cards as well as the old forest snare ones too.  These cards are great for seizing up enemies in the staging area as well as boosting Faramir's attack.  I put all the new ranger/gondor themed allies in as well and a couple Haldir's.  I really wanted to like the new Ranger Bow attachment, but I really dislike the fact that it makes you exhaust the character as well as the attachment; if it was exhaustion of only the bow, I would love the effect as well as the artwork instead of just the artwork. 

 

I left out event/attachment healing cards; however I put three copies of Warden of Healing in and got one in play.  Then, from my other set of Leadership/Tactics heroes, I played Steward of Gondor on Mirlonde to give her a resource boost, which in turn allowed the Warden to exhaust/refresh to quickly heal everyone after they took damage.  

 

I also put several different cards in to accelerate card draw, such as Mithrandir's Advice, so I could get allies out quick because in the beginning, the low amount of questing willpower was definitely a problem.  After several Gondorian allies came into play, though, it was not so bad.   Finally, I put three Watch Tower Watchmen in to round out the allies and was actually able to use their card effect for the first time ever. 

 

The thing I like best about mono-sphere decks is not having to worry about getting cards that you can't afford because nearly all cards can be purchased relatively quickly (especially if one of your heroes has the Steward of Gondor attachment.)  Lore might not be the best sphere to have a mono-deck with, but if you have another deck in play to give them a few boosts, they perform much better.

I find lore to be the most poweful mono sphere. Mirlonde is shining here, her bonus drops the starting threat by 3, and her synergy with the Silvan Tacker offers an additional healing bonus. I often play her together with Bilbo and Denethor. That is a starting threat of 22. Haldir and Gildor can be played early in the game, you have the traps, healers, card draw, encounter deck manipulation with Risk some Light, shadow effect cancellation and, as a last resort, Protector of Lorien.

 

Another good deck is Mirlonde, Aragor and Elrond. The Elrond/Vilya/Gildor combo is powerful enough to beat every scenario.

I also got the feeling that Lord Alcaron is not long for this world. It would be interesting how it plays out if that is the case. I hope it's not just part of the narrative, and they actually find some way to have him sacrifice himself as part of the quest mechanics. 

 

On the other hand, I also wouldn't mind getting him as a hero.

So maybe Lord Alcaron = the evil mastermind, a Black Numenórean. He's playing the good guy, but setting Faramir up.

I think it would be like Lord Alcaron trusted the wrong people and when he shows up with Faramir they turn on him. He gets stabbed in the process, he is able to find the heroes and asks them to save Faramir with his dying breath.

Welp, si it seems the hero fo this AP is gonna be a female gondorian created by FFG... Here's hoping she's good at least.

Her ability MAY be decent, but I'll wait to see her stats.
