## 1 [Gunslinger83 on September 6, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/229390-the-one-card-that-needs-errata-to-balance-this-gamethoughts/?do=findComment&comment=2400777)

I have been playing this game since the core set released, and am of  the opinion that the single biggest mistake the designers of this game have made is the "Steward of Gondor" card. I've been thinking about this for a long time, but the thought "bubbled back up" the other day while listening to the COTR podcast guys speculate about the potential need to errata "Blood of Gondor" and "Gondorian Fire". It amazed me that nobody seemed to recognize that the root of the problem underneath these two, and many other resource generated effect cards... is SOG. I've also noted that a lot of the more well known community deck builders, like Seastan and Ataruslash, seem to be hooked on it like it's cocaine, and  barely have the ability to make a deck without it. This isn't a slam on them, but rather a slam on a card design that makes 1 card so central to virtually every power deck ever built.

From the very beginning I've struggled with this card. It's offensive to one's sense of theme to constantly have to justify how Amarthiul, or Celeborn is suddenly the Steward of Gondor. It only took me a few plays before I became bored with including it in every deck, as it's so up-front overpowered and has no subtlety to it at all. It almost takes an entire consideration element, resource generation/management, out of the game once it hits the table. 

 I feel that I have been forced to play it as the lynchpin behind so many decks all of these years, that I almost can't stand to play it anymore... and yet I still feel pressured to because all of the newest scenarios released seem to assume a SOG driven resource power curve. It's part of the reason why they have struggled to bring the "Gondor" themed trait to maturity... because the biggest distinct perk that the Gondor archetype has (resource generation and hero defense) is applicable to everybody thanks to one OP card (along with a free Gondor trait to boot!). It is so blatantly powerful, that it changes the game, sort of similar to how a black hole warps gravity within it's vicinity... to where it in and of itself is an integral mechanic of the game an not just a card.

The sad thing is, it would be the world's easiest card to errata and fix ALL of these problems. One simply has to replace "gains Gondor trait" with "play on a hero with the Gondor trait". Boom. It fixes the thematic problem, it somewhat mitigates the power problem (now you atleast have to play "In service of the Steward" before abusing it in every power deck you make), AND it actually gives the Gondor archetype something to build around as a distinct contribution to deck building. Suddenly not just every deck can make use of nearly infinite resources and "Gondorian Shields". These actually become special things that require the Gondor archetype as atleast a sub-theme.

It's incredible how they won't touch the obvious offender, and yet they'll completely nerf an otherwise interesting card like "Master of Lore" in an attempt to stop one obscure combo that only people interested in exploiting and breaking the game are going to play anyway... and not even the most offensive card in this combo!

Curious to the thoughts of other long time players? I really think deck building would be far more interesting and balanced if SOG were errata'd.

This topic seems to come up a lot. I actually rarely put Steward in my decks. Silvan, Noldor, Spirit Theoden Rohan, hero Gandalf, Caldara, Heir of Valandil Dunedain, Damrod traps... None of these decks really ask for Steward. As far as it being OP relative to other resource generation, sure. So is A Test of Will for its effect.

I find it pretty strong to claim that modern quests demand Steward's use -- the only quests from the last couple of cycles I have felt compelled to use it for were Helm's Deep, Carn Dum, and Ruins of Belegost. I don't find it amiss that the hardest of the hard push you towards power cards; for the same reason, those were also the quests where I used A Burning Brand, which I frankly find more problematic than Steward (but still wouldn't care to errata).

(Steward IS in a couple of my more recent published decklists, but when you're talking about recurring Infighting or two-hero Secrecy, you deserve a couple of power cards...)

I bet Nate French could've saved himself a lot of emails if he'd just named it "Support of Gondor", though.

Can I give multiple likes to a post? Because this is amazing in its accuracy.

I've always thought they could mitigate it with one of 3 changes:

-play on a Gondor hero

-gives 1 resource, not 2

-exhaust attached hero to trigger its effect

It is remarkably boring that every One Deck to Rule Them All mandates 3 SOG's, and w/o Leadership, 3 Good Harvests as well. 6 deck slots for one card? That's unrealistic. And just bothers me when it's for a Silvan deck or an Ent deck or a Hobbit deck or whatever. And every multiplayer game, the biggest competition is who gets Steward, which creates far more animosity between players than a co-op game should.

Has anyone crunched the ringsdb numbers as to what percent of decks use this card?

On a related note, I still play Master of Lore pre-errata, because I don't use SOG in my Ranger deck and need some resource smoothing ability. That nerf was completely unnecessary just to fix one broken mega-combo.

I agree with the 1st post. In my opinion SoG is the best card so far in the entire card pool. Changing from "gains Gondor trait" to "play on a hero with the Gondor trait" helps and makes things more thematic as well, although to be honest I also think Blood of Numenor and Gondorian Fire need fixing too, since no matter what, you shouldn't be boosting defense/attack over +3 with these cards. Stuff like Protector of Lorien, Elven Spear and some others limit things to a maximum of +3, so I dont see why BoN or GF shouldn't have these limits as well, regardless of whether SoG gets errata'd or not.

if you play Leadership you kinda need Steward because their cards are so expensive. I wish it hadn't been so powerful, but the game has evolved with it in play since the core and to take it away now would be a mistake.

Yeah, I've always seen SoG as an extremely powerful card for recurring resource generation, even back in the Core only days. Borderline OP IMO. It's like the Black Lotus or the Moxes back in the early days of Magic where no one really understood how extremely powerful resource generation really is. You'd be stupid not to play it, it just accelerates the deck in question so much, especially with it's buddy, A Good Harvest.

Because the cost of the cards only changes at certain thresholds, I had a few extra cards that I could do something else with, so I decided to print my own personal errata for Steward of Gondor:

so...   the problem really is SoG in solo decks.  Powerful unique cards in general sort of get unbalanced in solo, because the only one you have to share with is yourself.   When you hit a 4 p multiplayer game, SoG doesn't hardly seem so bad.  Because there can only be one on the table.   Even in a 2 player game, the effectiveness of SoG is basically cut in half of what it is during solo play.

i dislike Steward for rather different reasons: in multiplayer games, it unbalances the performance of the decks in many cases. Whichever side gets the Steward can dominate while the other decks are left behind a bit. I would even prefer it to read "exhaust to add one resource to attached hero's resource pool. Then, add a resource to the resource pool of another player's hero". Even though this makes it even more powerful.

With that said, I'd suggest that if it is only a problem in solo decks, then it isn't that much of a problem. I think that the larger problem isn't the card itself, but that it is a card that has been taken into account in the design of almost every quest in the game. Any significant errata on it at this point in the game would have some pretty serious ramifications. As a mostly solo player (and not a particularly good one), I certainly do lean on that crutch and would be somewhat disappointed to see it go away. I think some of the changes mentioned (1 resource instead of 2 especially) would have been better original design, but spilled milk and all.

Really, instead of errata or designing quests that punish/trivialize/are designed around SoG I'd like to see them continue down the path they are on... finding other, more interesting, means of accelerating resources/reducing costs.

The whole thing does really shine a spotlight on just how important resource acceleration really is in the game.

I don't think that's his problem. The real problem is that if you want to look on ringsdb and 75% of the posted decks rely on a card you don't want to use because you think it's design is bad then you have a very small amount of decks you're interested in. That would change if this card would receive an errata.

 

And thumbs up for the suggested errata I could totally live with that!

How about "Attach to a Steward hero."

 

Just joking. Did not used this card much because it did not make sense from the lore point, but with new leadership Denethor it looks interesting.

 

I dont think it errata is a good idea (i like the way you errata'd it tho), as it will break many people's decks. And its not like its neutral, so you have to get leadership resources to pay for it.

There's another way to errate it: make it enter play exausted! And why not? Limit Unexpected Courage to 1 per hero! And change Burning Brand to: "While attached hero is defending, it gains:Response:Exhaust A Burning Brand..."! People are going to hate this is there ever comes a FAQ that does this.

If anything I tend to end up with a big stockpile of resources on at least one hero after a few turns of games. Maybe I'm building decks wrong, but card draw is almost always a more limiting/deciding factor in quest success.

 

Even when using a hero like Elrohir I rarely seem to have enough consistent demand for the extra resources to make it worth it.

 

It feels like a luxury for a lot of decks. I'm sure some of the 75% of decks that are using it are doing so out of habit not necessity.

That would change if this card would receive an errata.

If 75% of the posted decks actually require Steward of Gondor to function properly, then what would change with an errata is that 75% of the posted decks would no longer function properly.  This is not a good thing.

 

However, the actual percentage is likely to be somewhat lower, since most non-leadership decks don't include Steward for obvious reasons.  There are 86 pages of published decks at ringsdb, and 37 pages of decks with Steward of Gondor.  It's actually not even the most commonly used card (39 pages of decks with Test of Will), though it obviously is a very well-used card.  Of course, with most of those 37 pages of decks, there's more than a fair possibility that you won't have Steward of Gondor in your opening hand, especially if you have only one core set, so I very much doubt SoG is *required*.  For the few power decks that are guaranteed to get SoG quickly into your possession, I very much doubt someone who doesn't like playing Steward of Gondor because of its design would be interested in playing those decks in the first place.  If Steward of Gondor is a problem when playing solo, it's clearly a self-inflicted problem.

Without doubt SoG is a strong card. But I strongly disagree it needs errata. Let's look at the pros and cons:

 

Pro:

-increases a player's ressources per turn by 67% (5 instead of 3)

-grants the Gondor trait (what enables specific attachments and other buffs)

-low cost

-instantly repays itself (you don't loose "tempo" for playing SoG as you get your invested back instantly)

-universally useful (the ressources can be used for anything, unlike something like "O Lorien")

-Attachment (unaffacted by charcater targetting effects)

 

Cons:

-Leadership only (so you have to "find" a way to pay for it without a Fitting hero)

-Attachment (affected by attachment targetting effects)

-unique (only one can be in Play at a given time)

 

What instatly comes to mind is, that there are more pros, than cons, so it looks like SoG is at least decent. As being an attachment usually is more "safe" than being an ally this is more of a pro than a con. Needing access to Leadership is also fairly easy these days (a good harvest is probably the best example), so that's only a small downside. Getting two extra ressources per turn is great and don't having to wait for them even better.

So why don't errata it? Because it is unique.

The more Players there are the weaker SoG gets. Assuming the Players have Access to ressource trading adding two extra to a pool of 9 is much worse than to 3.

In my oppinion the idea of SoG being to good comes mainly from Solo Play. You might argue that in multiplayer games everyone tries to get down Steward first, but I would say that it's still preferable to have SoG out than not to, but that goes for any Card that is deemed "good". If you face much (direct) damage, you want your wardens of ealing out asap.

The nice Thing about solo Play is the ability to Play every Card you want without looking at other Players. Wanna go Gandalf? Sure. Light of Valinor? Noone else will take that. Unique Cards always look better solo than multiplayer, because they are only balanced, because they are unique, what has the least Impact in solo Play.

 

I am not sure, if looking at the amounts of decks in ringsdb that use SoG says much more about the Card, than that is good and useful. I always have the Impression (could be wrong though) most of the posted decks are self-sustained (aka playable solo) as it is much easier to uplot These decks than Fellowships of 2 or more decks that are supposed to work together. 

The fact that there are a good amount of decks that have no Leadership heroes and run a good harvest to get it in Play doesn't allow for errata either. When printing a Card like AgH you WANT People to Play one or two off colour Cards. Songs etc. are much better for smoothing than a good harvest. that it results mostly in Steward being picked is it's universally functionality. And that is one of the few Cards that work super good with any sphere, you wouldn't Play many other Cards off sphere. Feint is an awesome Card, but why run it in my mono Spirit deck, that either can't fight at all (and therefore can't benefit from that one round) or already handles combat nicely with Spirit Options. Trying to say: Only effects that are always good will ever be splashed and we have very few of them (and you can't use AgH before a Response like a test of will, otherwise this would be done, too).

 

To summarize: SoG just Looks to good especially in solo Play, but that goes for all strong unique Cards. SoG in General is from the root of it's design a Card that it's better to have than not and we have so few of These that an easily splashable attachment (FFG pretty much invited People with the release of AgH) gets more Attention than it Needs.

If you don't like "always good" Cards the only solution is to cut SoG from your Collection, but you better don't run a test of will either.

I find suggesting errata for a card simply because you don't like how often it is used is a terrible terrible reason to do so. I also would disagree with the stance that it is Over Powered because that is a very very subjective term.  And if you want this card to get an errata for being OP, then why not ALL cards that fall into your definition of OP?   Also, note that people who want this change would then be affecting the games of others if an official errata was released.  And if your reply to that is, "well you can just ignore the errata", then my reply would be "you can just "house-rule" the errata yourself and play it your own way and leave my cards alone, please and thank you."

 

 I really think errata should only be used to limit broken limitless combos or to correct unintended scenarios - though the latter is mainly for encounter cards.

This ^ is freaking righteous. Hats off to you sir, not only did you think of this before me.... you went as far to print off cards!!! I'd almost pay you to personally mail one of these to each of the game's designers, and maybe 3 for myself.

Wow, really impressed by the quality of discussion....exceeded my expectations for this thread. Love this community.

Anyway, so I do concede a few things that I hadn't thought of when writing this. SOG is indeed a problem that scales down with number of players. I've been playing this game 5 years and have only played real live multiplayer maybe 5 or 6 times, the rest has been solo (occasionally) or double fisting (mostly)... so that does tend to color my perspective. It makes sense that more players in the game tends to tone down things like unique power cards and surge, and drive up the problem of location lock, etc.... so the game does definitely change with number of players.

As far as the argument that making an errata now would nerf 75% of the power decks, I have two things to say about that:

1. Good. It will force creativity. Now when the deck building gurus sit down and open their binders, they'll actually have to consider resource acceleration as something they have to creatively implement in their design, instead of a run of the mill 3x "A Good Harvest", 3x "SOG", done... on to next element. One of my biggest problems with SOG is not only it's power, but that it's so damned boring. It's like playing Tactics Boromir every time. In fact, what finally solidified my opinion on this card was when I realized that the only way I was able to beat "Deadman's Dike" was turning Elrohir into Tactics Boromir...literally. If the card were atleast the slightest bit interesting, I could forgive it's power. I mean don't people get bored out of their minds playing this card deck after deck after deck?

2. Actually, the errata I propose doesn't even really nerf it's power... it just confines it to an archetype. If you want the tremendous resource acceleration of SOG, gotta find some way to incorporate Gondor into your deck. This is almost too easy with the new Leadership Denethor.... as he's set up to do exactly that. And that brings me to my next point.....

The thing that offends me the most about this card is what it does to the "Gondor" trait archetype. I really believe it's the reason that the designers have not been able to give us a compelling reason to build Gondor decks in 4 deluxe boxes, 4 chapter back cycles, and 4 saga releases of player cards.

It's clear to me that Gondor was supposed to be the resource generating/ultra defense archetype.... sort of how the Dunedain are the enemy engagement bonus archetype, the Silvans are the "in and out" archetype, etc. However, the most powerful resource generating tool that Gondor has, is available to everybody! Not only that, but the damned thing actually GIVES the Gondor trait... meaning whoever SOG gets played on can take advantage of all the Gondor defense/resource synergy.

Why would you ever build a Gondor deck when the best that the Gondor archetype has can easily be incorporated into any archetype with 3 cards (6 if no leadership heroes)? That in my mind is the biggest problem.... and the reason I suggest the errata that I do.

Not sure if adding "Attach to Gondor Hero" really reduces the power very much. Tactics Boromir and Leadership Denethor are arguably some of the best targets for it right now, which would not be affected, and it's thematically sound. SoG is a powerful card to be sure, but it is entirely optional with all the different discounts that exist for Noldor, Silvan, Dunedain, or Rohan decks. Or just run a Caldara deck or a Elrond/Vilya deck and put stuff into play for free. Or run a Gloin undefended attack deck and generate more resources than SoG ever could. Steward of Gondor can enhance all these decks if included, but it's definitely not a make or break kind of thing.

Well, that hurts. But really, how do you make this logical connection? If someone is building a power solo deck they are obviously going to use the best cards. That doesn't mean it's impossible to build good decks without them, it's just that there's no compelling reason to.

 

In other news, I normally take the bus to work. From this we can conclude that I'm addicted to public transit and also don't know how to ride a bike.

I get where you are coming from. 

 

Thematically it's probably the most controversial card in the game. Theme-loving players, such as myself, have had a problem with this card since the core set. Eventually my own mind errata-ed the cardname to 'Support of the Gondor' and that's the end of that. It's the only suggestion I got I'm afraid.

 

 

As for the power of the card...

 

First off, errata on this card would be fairly useless. After all, errata is usually given to prevent certain game-states from occuring. And while SoG is the easiest resource acceleration card in the game, it is not the only one.

 

In the Galdor/Cirdan deck I've been using lately, getting the Zigil Miner/ Stargazer combo up is so easy due to how fast I'm going through my deck, that it's essentially just another SoG (3 Zigies, 2 stargazers and Narya works unsuprisingly well :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]). Gloin has reached his real potential and getting 60+ resources on him without SoG is business as usual. And resource-happy heroes such as Arwen and Denethor have arrived. In other words: without SoG in the game, we can still create tons of resources. Alternatively, Caldara and other 'put into play' effects have also been trending lately (. 

 

So at this point, all SoG does, is allow less dedicated Uber decks to catch up with the power decks that are already available. So I would argue the opposite: in today's metagame, SoG actually balances the game more!

 

 

As for holding back the Gondor trait...

 

I wouldn't draw any links between it's succes and Gondor's waning. Sure, Gondor would be more popular if the card only went on them, but honestly, Gondor right now is just an 'adjusted for balance' version of the dwarves. It's underdeveloped as a trait and it's 'powers up through resources' mechanic is barely developed.

 

 

Back to the power thing...

 

So you've noticed that most power decks include SoG and concluded that it is used in all decks and that the current quests require resource generation which removes the aspect of resource gathering. First of all, if it truely removed the resource gathering part, people would simply play more expensive cards. Gandalfs for everyone. That doesn't happen, so it's not that powerful. Second, and this is the most important thing, using SoG requires you to DRAW it and PLAY it before you can reap it's power. And if your deck can only win if you have it in your opening hand, you'll not be winning much games. Every powerdeck needs to be able to survive without a SoG in case you don't draw it. This is why I prefer to deckbuild without SoG initially, then include it once I'm certain my deck holds up well enough if I don't draw it. And while Seastan may snort SoG like crack cocaine from a Good Harvest, all his decks that run SoG are capable of standing their own before he draws into it. And lately the quests have gotten better in punishing turtle-style decks by requiring players to go 100% from turn 1. SoG takes time to really influence the game.

 

Which leads to the final fair point you make: quests expect you to run SoG. This seems to be true for solo. Quests have grown with the power curve of the game. Combat power (T), Willpower (S), card draw (L) and resource acceleration (L) have all become nessecities to win against the harder quests solo. That means each sphere have lost to spherebleeding some aspect that it used to dominate. I used to hate that, but having played through the last cycle multiple times, I have to admit that it is required in order to keep up. And that's not nessecarily a bad thing. Turtleing ( slowly building up an army, then stomping through the quest) was the norm in the early days, now the encounter deck also builds up. Playing SoG doesn't mean you'll auto-win the late game anymore. And that too, is a good thing. But it's only possible if the encounter deck is STRONGER than a random SoG deck.

 

 

So yeah, I get what you're saying. But I think SoG is too easily replacable by other cards to change the meta-game by removing it, helps 'weaker' decks compete with others, is not as powerful as you think it is due to the low chance of drawing it and decks need to be build to surivive without it. I also approve of encounter decks being powerful late game so it deals with the turtle strategy without finicky time-counters (how I hate those things!).

Once upon a time, there was a really broken card in this game. Thousand times stronger than Steward, and also from Leadership Sphere. Fortunetly, Sauron nerfed it by smashing it into pieces. 

 

 

Yup, this card is Sword that WAS Broken.

Because the cost of the cards only changes at certain thresholds, I had a few extra cards that I could do something else with, so I decided to print my own personal errata for Steward of Gondor:

Yeah, I'm pretty happy with the quality of PrinterStudio. The cards are a shade darker than the originals, comparable to how FFG's POD cards don't quite match with respect to color balance either. They're waxier than FFG's cards too. I probably wouldn't use them without card sleeves.

> This ^ is freaking righteous. Hats off to you sir, not only did you think of this before me.... you went as far to print off cards!!! I'd almost pay you to personally mail one of these to each of the game's designers, and maybe 3 for myself.

Well thank you! I wouldn't want to sell them to anyone, though--I printed them for myself!

 

For what it's worth, the reason I was motivated to house rule this card was to give Gondor more of an identity. I feel like we've recently hit a critical mass of alternative resource acceleration cards such that Steward of Gondor is no longer required in most decks, even for high-level solo play. Limiting the card to Gondor heroes tightens up the Gondor synergy and carves out a niche for all of the different resource acceleration cards in different decks.

 

I don't know that I would go so far as to call for an official errata, though. Steward of Gondor has been a core mechanic for the game for so long that I'm not sure I can fully fathom how it would change the early game without the full modern cardpool. I'd prefer if the card were designed this way at the start, but at this point I think it might be too late to fix in an official capacity.

> 2. Actually, the errata I propose doesn't even really nerf it's power... it just confines it to an archetype. If you want the tremendous resource acceleration of SOG, gotta find some way to incorporate Gondor into your deck. This is almost too easy with the new Leadership Denethor.... as he's set up to do exactly that. And that brings me to my next point.....

> The thing that offends me the most about this card is what it does to the "Gondor" trait archetype. I really believe it's the reason that the designers have not been able to give us a compelling reason to build Gondor decks in 4 deluxe boxes, 4 chapter back cycles, and 4 saga releases of player cards.

Not only that, but the damned thing actually GIVES the Gondor trait... meaning whoever SOG gets played on can take advantage of all the Gondor defense/resource synergy.
> 
> Why would you ever build a Gondor deck when the best that the Gondor archetype has can easily be incorporated into any archetype with 3 cards (6 if no leadership heroes)? That in my mind is the biggest problem.... and the reason I suggest the errata that I do.

I think you're right about connecting resources to the Gondor archetype -- LeBoromir and Visionary Leadership, the key cards for a Gondor deck, require an unspent resource.  You also see the unspent resource connection with Blood of Numenor and Gondorian Fire.  Add to that the heavy leadership tilt to Gondor allies, and it's clear that Gondor wants lots of resources -- Steward of Gondor is arguably more important to Gondor decks than any other type, and has the fringe benefit of making its recipient eligible for generic Gondorian buffs.

 

But slapping Steward/Blood/Fire on a single overpowered hero doesn't make it a "Gondor deck", even if the hero you are slapping it on is the very Gondorian TaBoromir.  If you're not playing Visionary Leadership, it's not a Gondor deck.  Why would you build a Gondor deck when Steward/Blood/Fire/Shield find themselves in all sorts of power decks?  How about because you want to play a *Gondor deck*, and a power deck without Visionary Leadership and a host of Gondorian allies isn't a Gondor deck?  Because you don't compete with other players, there's no requirement to play the most powerful deck possible, and even if a super TaBoromir deck is provably more efficient than a LeBoromir Gondor deck, the Gondor deck will present a different experience and is therefore worth playing.  All the designers need to do is make sure that Gondor as a trait is *viable*, which I think they've done.  We're actually getting cards and heroes that work well in a Gondor deck in this cycle, IMO.

 

Would having SoG require Gondor trait make Gondor decks more popular?  I doubt it.  To be sure, it'd increase the popularity of Gondor *heroes*, but putting Gondor heroes in other archtypes to get Steward of Gondor access doesn't strike me as a vast improvement.  (It would discourage non-Gondor heroes in actual Gondor decks, since you can't get Visionary Leadership buff and/or LeDenthor transfer to them as easily.)  Power decks wanting Steward of Gondor would find heroes like TaBoromir and LeDenethor even more attractive -- will this really encourage greater diversity of decks?

 

It would also make the core leadership cards for new players substantial less powerful, and I think that's a bad thing.

Clearly the only solution is to errata Tactics Boromir to remove his Gondor trait.

The Gondor allies are a conflicted bunch in my head anyways. Most of them don't have much of an attack power so the +1 attack from Boromir is making up for that.  They are also pretty weak at questing, so Visionary Leadership has to make up for that.   They chump defend like champions, so Horn of Gondor makes sense.  I feel a lot of their allies are relatively expensive for their limited usefulness, plus the extra requirement for having spare resources to get the boosts - means Steward of Gondor fits that bill.    Looking at the Gondor allies, I typically don't get too inspired to play that theme.  Looking through the Silvans, Ents and Rohan, I do.  I will say the LeAragorn, LeBoromir + Erestor is an awesome and fun deck to play, but it isn't a fully Gondor themed deck since I'm using non-Gondor heroes.  (Note that Sword that was Broken is also fairly necessary to make sure you can muster enough will power out of these rather crappy Gondor allies).  

 

That said, they are getting there with heroes but I don't think making SoG a Gondor only attachment will help push people to build that direction since the allies are still so scattered in what they do.

Thought about it some more. Has someone tried to let SoG enter Play exhausted? This way you actually have to pay it as you don't get your 2 ressources back instantly. Therefore you will miss out on some allies/attachments/Events, what can be a huge difference in a game that lasts for 5-10 rounds. 

Boromir-decks with Fire and Blood most likely would still function as they do now, since they get so insane once they are up and running and their other Combo pieces cost 0.

I play pure solo and nightmare mode most of the time (except the saga quests), and it is extremely difficult to build a powerful solo deck without SoG. And there are limites, I think, to restrain yourself from playing an ''unthematic'' card like SoG and not having fun playing, knowing that you'll loose 99 % of the time!

I don't think it's the case that 75% of decks can't function without it -- like I said, if a deck truly can't function without SoG, it also needs accelerated draw -- because without that, half the time you *won't* have Steward of Gondor in your opening hand.

 

But doesn't being widely popular indicate that a card is "a bit too good"?  What it indicates is that the card is both powerful (worth having in your deck), and accessible (able to play in a wide variety of decks).  Is that a bad thing?  Certainly if there were too many such cards, you could build a generic deck with generic cards, and that wouldn't be much fun.  But a small number of staple cards that are useful in a wide variety of decks leaves ample room for deckbuilding, and I think it's no accident that most staple cards are in fact in the Core Set.  If the core set didn't have staple cards that were both powerful and general, what hope would new players have of building decent decks with the tiny starting card pool?  The shame of the core set isn't that cards like Steward of Gondor and Test of Will are too good -- it's that cards like Power in the Earth are too bad.  Cards that are "too good" can be easily ignored by thematic players or players seeking a greater challenge -- and by this point, there are *plenty* of alternatives to Steward of Gondor for resource acceleration.  If Steward of Gondor is still the easiest and best, it's certainly not *required* with a full card pool.  Cards that are too bad are no use to anyone.

 

Here's how the staple cards (cards I consider to be generally useful in any deck containing the appropirate sphere) stack up at ringsdb in terms of pages:

87 all published decks

44 core Gandalf

39 A Test of Will

37 Steward of Gondor

32 Unexpected Courage

28 Sneak Attack

28 Daeron's Runes

26 Feint

22 Warden of Healing

19 Galadhrim's Greeting

18 Arwen Undomiel ally

17 Hasty Stroke

16 A Burning Brand

15 Quickbeam ally

13 Treebeard ally

13 Gleowine ally

8 Honour Guard

 

I know Honour Guard isn't on anyone else's list of staples but mine, but I love those guys and would gladly find room for them in any tactics deck.  There are other staples if you have a hero match, especially these two:

 

23 Elrond's Counsel

20 Light of Valinor

 

Should all the staple cards be nerfed to "balance" the game?  What are you trying to balance it with?  Decks vary widely in effectiveness, and quests vary widely in difficulty.  There's no magic level to shoot for anywhere.  And when we fall back on popularity, it's important to remember what all those decks on ringsdb represent -- decks that players enjoyed playing and/or creating enough to share them with other players.  If deckmakers generally *like* to play with Steward of Gondor, how does taking one of their favorite cards away improve the game?

I recommend reading this article.

The conclusion is that SoG will be toned down with a lot of choice for ressource generation. And even if SoG IS the best card, having to find it first isn't reliable enough, so it's just like a very good draw, but you can eventually play well without ever drawing it.

 

Each time I see the preview for the new cards, I see Unexpected Courage / readying effect suffer the same fate, and same for Burning Brand / shadow management.

Heh "Support of the Gondor" sounds pretty awesome actually, its the same first letter for cards like "Doors of Durin" and "Steward" even have same number of letters as "Support". Makes more sense than Gloin suddenly becoming Steward of Gondor too.

I'll admit that it requires a little themeblindness to have SOG in my Sam deck, however I think limiting it to only gondor takes away one of its most thematic uses. When Aragorn arrives in Minas Tirith he gets the resources of gondor and becomes "one of them".

Instead of errata, why not release a different unique card called Steward of Gondor with different abilities (maybe a different sphere) that would compete with the Core set version? This would not be so different from getting multiple versions of unique heroes/allies.

 

Of course, a new "Steward of Gondor" card would need to be situationally better than the current one (perhaps depending on solo/multiplayer or deck archetype) without being universally better. There are several ways the designers could represent the wealth/knowledge of Gondor with such an attachment. For instance, they could print a Lore Steward of Gondor that attaches to a Gondor hero and exhausts itself and/or the hero to either use Henamarth's or Lore Denethor's ability. A spirit version might exhaust to ready another attachment, replicating the ability of Unexpected Courage for attachments.

I.M.O steward is not even the problem. The problem are some cards going with it and how those cards can switch from good to O.P.

I got two in mind. BLood of Numenor and Gondorian Fire.

As others said already, nerfing it is useless. It's a bit like nerfing Black Lotus in Magic after all those years... Pointless really.

They already nerfed a ressource generator, (and badly (i.m.o), wich was the horn of gondor :  yeah i said baldy nerfed coz' they could have wrote "limit 2x per turn" or "1x per phase" or something the like.

And they did that for... 1 single deck abusing it... ! Good Job FFG... -> to me, this was the award winner for the "Best absurd nerf" !

To be honest, i would rather have some reworks on some low heroes that are not played or unbalanced (like Bilbo for exemple... lower his threat by 2 would help him a lot i reckon)

So about that steward again.. I would also say that this kind of "O.P" card is needed in a card game. Every card game got those cards.

And to be honest, without it, a lot of decks would not work at all. And reducing that ratio. would defenatly hurt the game and community in a real bad way.

So yeah, a lot of people plays it, and a lot of people don't ! (in a 4p game, just one steward is on table.. And well.. Other players are not complaining...)

To me steward is more a solo (needed) card ! That help against those big hard quests.

Coz some quest are that hard, that you need the best to succed them. And not only steward.. We could also speak about Test of Will and the almost obligation to play Spirit in solo ! (to me, this is a much biggest problem than that steward...)

About Thematic... You said "the worst thematic" ? really ? I can gave you some other "unthematic" or stuff that makes me laughed a lot in this game instead of this one :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

How about Tree beard that put some burning brand to his own "bones" ? ^_^ [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_happy.png]

Or do you know that joke starting like :  Once upon a time, there's was an Ent on a boat...

How about having two mounts... ? i mean... you put the 1st mount on the horse, then you climb them both ? To me it's a bit like a guy driving 2 car at the same time... Some sort...

If Steward of gondor hurt your Thematic love, i suggest you to never watch those Bilbo the Hobbits movie ! ^^ (they're bad actually so i'm really suggesting you to never watch those ^^) (ok landscapes are nice, of course they are ! New Zealand is wonderful !)

Well, i will stop here for those exemple but i got many more.

To me steward has to stay as it is.

Not like we had'nt some other ressources generators or mechanic that just does'nt need that steward to work propely !

Instead of all that, i would strongly recommand to ffg to rework some lower cards nor heroes ! (wich they never will of course ^_^ [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_happy.png] )

Another unthematic interaction to add to your list: "My Silvans have all quietly gone to hide in the trees to surprise the enemy. Now I blast the Horn of Gondor!"

 

I think this errata would've come with the new Tactics Imrahil anyway. Too OP otherwise.

Well sure Horn needed a nerf, but not one like that... Limit 2x a turn or 1x phase would have been much more interresting. Not to mention that this attachement is "Restricted" ... So now... The card is pretty much dead compare to what a good rework could have done instead. A bit of a shame that FFG don't take some more time to think more about cards creation or nerf... or to just step back sometimes...

My contender for the worst errata is Master of Lore. They should just have nerfed Born Aloft to Limit 1 per phase. I believe the best errata is Feint.

Why too OP ?

 

New Prince Imrahil capacity is limited by once per turn. So horn of Gondor is just an attachment which erase the drawback like Light of Valinor for Glorfindel sp.

I don't think it was OP ... but i really think that Prince Imrahil tactic + Horn of Gondor (before errata) was thematic.

 

I have never played Horn of Gondor with Silvan (no need). But i have played it with Gondor and Rohan, so thematic and now so useless ...

 

I agree with Aorakis.

Horn of Gondor gets a lot better the more players you have, and I think it's just about perfect thematically now. It makes me wish we could get a Leadership version of it that gained resources when an enemy was defeated.

I've wanted a tactics or leadership attachment that generates resource when you kill enemies for a long time now and although we got Sword of Numenor it isn't what I wanted and I hope that we do get a different version of some sort eventually.

Sword of Numenor is your friend !

 

The errata is bad because it killed number of decks. Before errata, i have seen it sometimes without abuses and now, it's just an image in a binder.

The only players who play it didn't know the errata. When i explain the errata, player is disappointed and put the image in a binder.

 

So bad errata ! A limitation like three time per turn could have been better.

We just play with the old Horn of Gondor rules and it works perfectly fine as long as you don't do something silly. It doesn't get into all that many decks we make these days and when it does it just performs decently. So, I recommend just ignoring the ruling.

> I'll admit that it requires a little themeblindness to have SOG in my Sam deck, however I think limiting it to only gondor takes away one of its most thematic uses. When Aragorn arrives in Minas Tirith he gets the resources of gondor and becomes "one of them".

This is precisely why we have "In Service of the Steward". In fact, this card is a living illustration of what this game is missing as far as a defined "Gondor" trait. This would normally be a heavy sought after card if it was actually required to give heroes a Gondor synergy as well as play SOG. No other trait splasher (Elf-Friend, Nor am I a Stranger, etc.) is 0 cost while having an ability that represents the best of it's trait synergy. 

Honestly, this thread has influenced my view on SOG. I get the arguments of how it might be necessary in solo play against the hardest scenarios, how it's less effective with more players, that there are more good resource generating options every cycle to atleast decrease the absolute dependence on it, and how a card like this might be necessary in a Core box deck for new players. I still think that they could have toned down it's OP'ness a "little" bit.... a good suggestion being coming into play exhausted....but I get the "pro" arguments.

I've come to realize that I could probably live with it's power as long as nobody who uses it ever complains about the game being too easy. (seriously, every time somebody complains about the game being too easy, I go and look at their decks and see SOG with all the same power cards! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png])

I think now the part that really offends me the most is the "attached character gains Gondor trait" part. Even just deleting this line from the card altogether would be a vast improvement....as it would still give away Gondor's best resource generator to all archetypes but it wouldn't give away the Gondor synergy for free (i.e. Gondorian Shield, Wealth of Gondor, etc). Dain in a dwarf deck or Elrohir in a ninja deck would cease being the epitome of the Gondor archetype.

I mean, what was the thought process behind it? 

"Man, this card is not game breaking OP'ed enough, lets allow it to give away the Gondor synergy for free to give it a boost"? Honestly, as experimental as this game design was, they probably had no clue what it was going to look like in reaching maturity, and should probably be forgiven this. That's sort of how "first of their type" designs work.... lot's of inevitable design mistakes and learning points.

Actually, I have a theory that the designers secretly agree with most of what I've been saying. I think that somewhere around the HoN deluxe, when Caleb and Matt were taking over and trying to develop a Gondor synergy, somebody took a second look at the core cards and thought "oh.......crap". I think they realized how the design of SOG cramped their Gondor (and resource generation) design space, but decided to roll with it anyway since it was already so integral to the game at that point... and they have been fighting it ever since. 

In COTR's 100th episode, the designers were asked if there were any cards they regretted, and it was pretty obvious from the answer that there was. Of course, they didn't talk about it as is only professional, but what they "didn't" say really said it all.

I have no doubt what card is at the top of their list, and I have full confidence that when the LOTR LCG 2.0 reboot hits, any SOG equivalent will be a lot more toned down and balanced from the outset. However, if my theory is correct, that also means that it is highly unlikely that they will ever errata it at this point in the game.... even if they secretly agree with me. They will continue to try to boost the Gondor trait, continue to find other creative means of resource generation to help "soften the blow" of SOG on the meta.

 

To me, it's very obvious that Leadership Denethor was designed "specifically" to be the target of SOG... and thus tie it back in to Gondor decks in the meta. By releasing an extremely powerful Gondor hero that is the perfect target for SOG, they practically ensure that people show up to groups with Denethor decks that tie up SOG. It's actually probably the most brilliant move that they could have made to correct the meta without outright errata.

I think SoG is clearly OP because it pays for itself immediately so there is absolutely no trade off or investment (other than 3 copies of a unique in your deck). I knew it was broken day one. I just didn't care because the game was coop and the card was unique so I thought, hey maybe coop games will just work with lots of broken unique cards. Today I am more willing to say that the card is unhealthy for the game, and I agree with most of what has already been said in terms of criticism and proposed solutions. My favorite solution, by far, is to simply offer alternatives (since a nerf this late seems super unlikely). I especially like the idea of a new Steward of Gondor card. One of my favorite aspects of the game is competing versions of unique characters. If attachments can be included that would be great. I don't even think the new SoG would have to be better. It would just have to be worth playing and people would play it just because they are bored with the current version. I know I would. Then we can start getting alternative versions of the rings of power. Righy?

i don't know if they would change Steward of Gondor actually.

it is a powerful card, much moreso than many other cards don't get me wrong, but it's balanced unto itself. it's unique and exhausts to use, so it has a finite value of extra resources.

Horn of Gondor, on the other hand, does not exhaust to use nor does it have any upper limit for use, and used to have no restriction on what triggered it, leading to really broken, draw-your-entire-deck and generate unlimited resources combos. and sure, let's reduce our threat to 0 while we're at it.

they nerfed many cards that were part of these combos until they finally realised that Horn of Gondor should have been nerfed too (with all the previous cards nerfed as well)

Steward of Gondor is a very strong card, but it's far from broken imo.

I've heard a couple people mention a competitor for SOG.

Would it go something like:

2 cost Spirit attachment
attached character gains the Gondor trait
Setup Action: Include a 4th hero.

That might just be powerful enough to compete with the current iteration. Although as far as pure resource acceleration, a 4th hero takes several rounds to catch up with SOG's acceleration.... maybe made up for by having another statline on the table.


I will say though, I have noticed that they do seem to have plateaued the difficulty curve in this game a bit... to my relief. I don't think that Lost Realm is much more difficult than Voice of Isengard... and Grey Havens feels a little "less" difficult than Lost Realm.


I just played into Ithilien the other day again and found out that it still curb stomps my current decks that are otherwise successful against the majority of the last two cycles.... so the biggest difficulty jump seems to have been Heirs of Numenor, and since then the card pool has been outpacing the difficulty curve to catch back up.... atleast in my opinion.

So maybe they hopefully aren't playtesting new scenarios on the assumption that SOG is in every deck. Atleast if anybody complains about ease, they just only have to stop playing SOG. That's the inverse of what us thematic players get told all the time about difficult cycles right?

Would you have to have a starting threat equal to the combined threat of all 4 heroes or only 3 of them?

 

If you don't have to take the additional threat that would be an absolutely INSANE card.....

10 out of 10 times I would take an additional free fourth hero rather than 2 resources per turn.... that fourth hero generates a resource on their own to begin with, provides another character with a strong statline to quest/attack/defend with (and more than one action per turn with readying), another sphere match for playing cards and most importantly a fourth hero ability.

Hell even WITH a starting threat of all four heroes threat combined it would still be bananas in the right lineup.

Way too abusable and powerful in my opinion.

I definitely agree with pretty much everything you said about difficulty though. I feel like they have fixed difficulty big time since HoN and AtS. The only exception to this is Carn Dum but I rant about that quest all the time so I will not this time round!!

 

I felt that the Grey Havens was a little easier than The Lost Realm as well and am quite happy about that. 

The first quest in The Lost Realm can actually be really difficult if you get unlucky reveals such as multiple side quests appearing early on shutting down healing, taking your entire hand from you, stopping you from placing more than 3 progress a turn etc all at once. Threat in staging can be pretty nasty quite early as well especially with no engagement checks etc. Also TONS of threat gain. Then the third quest is pretty punishing as well.

It's funny how if you combine Frodo + Sam + Merry + Pippin, you'll get only 27 starting threat. I wonder if it'll break the game in some way building a deck with those four. I think I'm actually gonna try it for the sake of fun.

Would probably be a pretty awesome deck.
Merry with 4 base attack is pretty beasty. You could also play Treebeard first turn without any resource acceleration. 
Even more shennanigans with Hobbit Pipes etc.

Lol... I was actually being tongue in cheek sarcastic (about how OP SOG was) when I brought up the idea of playing a 4th hero, but now that you guys ran with it, I've kind of been playing with the idea a bit.

Now that I think about it, it's not actually that far outside of what the game can do anyway now with sword-thane or the new ally Prince Imrahil. Maybe even the extra increase in threat might make it an extremely powerful (again to compete with leadership SOG) card that is balanced by having a starting threat of 37 or 38. Would bring a new approach to valor and cards like "favor of the Valar". 

It would be the ultimate shot that you could fire at leadership SOG without just outright nerfing the damned thing.

My houserule on the card would be as follows:

 

 * Change the card name to "Riches of Westernesse"
 * Remove the giving of the "Gondor" trait. 
 * Change the resource generation to 1 for non-Gondor / non-Dunedain characters; 2 resources generated if attached to a Gondor or Dunedain character.

After reading through the thread I think my favorite idea is to remove the Gondor trait and give it 1 resource generation OR require Gondor trait and have 2.  I think what FeloniusBard recommends is a good middle ground between those two options.

Agreed.

 

Another issue with the proposed errata is that it would severely nerf a multitude of decks that are currently viable into uselessness.  The most obvious effect of this, would be decks that are currently strong now and unaffected by the errata would only become more ubiquitous because they would have less competition from other viable decks.  Basically, everyone would just play Boromir if they wanted to get a high win rate...instead of being able to use a variety of decks.

I don't see anything wrong with that. If a deck is so reliant on the card that it will be useless if an errata hits, then for one, the card was too powerful to begin with and finally, that's the very definition of a crutch. We saw Horn of Gondor get nerfed and that was a total surprise (but I feel a thematic win). Very late in the game's life too. I suspect SoG is next on the chopping block.

Agreed, the fact that SOG becomes necessary for a variety of decks to be viable means that a variety of decks aren't using more interesting and niche forms of resource acceleration. This actually gets at the problem of just how much interesting practical design space is blotted out by one OP card that becomes the crutch.

Sadly, I don't think we will get errata for SOG at this point. They would probably argue that it's too fundamental to the core set decks for new players.

My hope is that they learn from this and avoid this problem from the start in LOTR 2.0.

Many, many decks are reliant on a particular card -- usually heroes, but not always.  Nor does a deck becoming unviable after errata show that "the card was too powerful to begin with" -- that was certainly not the case with Master of Lore.  Errata has costs, and affecting the power level of every deck that currently uses a card is certainly a cost to be considered.

 

Let's consider the relevant definition of a crutch -- "a thing used for support or reassurance".  In which of these decks do you suppose the current "Steward of Gondor" is a crutch?

 

1) In a super-Boromir deck where it's used to drive Gondorian Fire and Blood of Numenor?

2) In a Sam-Pippin-Merry leadership deck where it is nice to have, but Resourceful is the card mulliganed for?

3) In a beginner's core set deck where it is used to play those hideously overpriced and weak core allies?

 

Is it a crutch for super-Boromir?  It's critical to generate insane offense/defense, but the deck is perfectly viable without it.  Threat is Boromir's currency, and Elrohir probably needs SoG more than Boromir does.

 

Is it a crutch for the standard Hobbit deck?  Not at all -- it comes in handy because it's a powerful card, but it isn't essential to the design.

 

Is it a crutch for the beginner's deck?  Absolutely, and it's worth mulliganing for.  Even *with* Steward of Gondor, the deck's power is marginal, without it Leadership has only Sneak Gandalf to bolster it compared to other spheres.

 

To my mind, this doesn't prove that SoG is "too powerful" and needs errata -- it shows that the core set *needs* powerful, general-purpose cards so that beginners can construct a *viable* deck.  It's no accident, I think, that nearly all the staple cards (useful to every deck of a sphere) are found in the core -- new players *need* crutches, and need them badly.  Advocating breaking those crutches because you are bored with them and no longer need them strikes me as exactly the wrong approach, especially in the cause of a non-existent need for "game balance".

 

With that said, I confess that a modified SoG that rewards Gondor instead of granting it is a more *interesting* card than the current model.  If the core set were redesigned from scratch, the revised Steward of Gondor would be fine as long as they also improved all the cruddy leadership cards that are coasters in the full card pool at the same time.  

 

At least the revised Steward of Gondor is still a useful card, unlike the errata-ed Horn of Gondor.  The new version may be "more thematic", but there's no shortage of thematic coasters.  The fate of Horn of Gondor and Master of Lore -- both "fixed" to resolve a "problem" generated chiefly by *other* cards -- is a graphic reminder that errata is not be lightly wished on any card.

Since SoG is more powerful than the "more interesting and niche forms of resource acceleration", why do you think that decks that need SoG to be "viable" would still be viable if they used the "more interesting and niche forms of resource acceleration"?  And is there really a benefit to driving decks that are on the edge of viability out of existence?

 

Since "more interesting and niche forms of resource acceleration" already exist, exactly what "practical design space" is being blotted out by Steward of Gondor?  I can understand the sentiment that the *many* resource generating player cards in leadership would be more popular if Steward of Gondor didn't exist -- Dori has a similar complaint against Beregond.  But the many niche and interesting resource generators and deck accelerators are proof positive that an attractive general-purpose *need not* close that space off against additional cards.  It's encouraging to see the designers have recently provided so many alternatives to A Hasty Stroke.  I hope A Test of Will alternatives are in the pipeline.

This part of what you said in particular stood out to me.  If we are to assume that design space is being blotted out because of Steward of Gondor, then we must also assume that cards that made it to creation were created with Steward of Gondor in mind.  If Steward of Gondor was to be nerfed, every card released at the same time as, and every card released after Steward of Gondor should receive appropriate modifications (that's every card).  Not really just leadership cards, in my opinion.  That's a tall order.

 

But hey, I'd be totally fine with Steward of Gondor getting the proposed errata.  Just make sure the following changes are also made:

 

Dain Ironfoot: (Add) After you play a Dwarf from your hand, add 1 resource to Dain Ironfoot's resource pool

Thorin: Collect 1 additional resource for every 5 Dwarves you control

Ori: Draw 1 additional card for every 5 Dwarves you control

 

Yeah, I don't want that useless card Steward of Gondor clogging my deck if I don't have to!

just to be clear, for many people, this was not a surprise but rather a 'it's about time'

Horn of Gondor, as i said in my previous post in this topic, had the potential for literally game-breaking combos wherein you could draw your entire deck, have infinite resources, 0 threat (and infinitely negative if the game allowed negative threat)

it was part of something that was truly 'broken' because it far exceeded the scope of the design space. other cards were given errata instead of Horn of Gondor, and they basically just now got around to finally fixing the main problem of all of those broken combos.

Steward of Gondor, while a very strong card, has had a hard cap on the amount it impacts the game. it increases its efficacy with a lower player count, and can only be used once per turn because it must exhaust. currently, there's no way to ready attachments outside of the standard action from the refresh phase. it's not part of any game-breaking combo, so i highly doubt we'll see it receive any treatment, especially since Rod of the Steward just came out that seemed almost tailored specifically to work with that card.

Two things:

1, Post-errata Horn is still a good card, at least in the right deck. Anyone who calls it a coaster is flat out wrong and most likely hasn't even tried to use it since the errata - which tbh I think is a general problem, people just assume that a card will be bad post-errata and don't even take the time and effort to find out.

2, Horn of Gondor was absolutely not errata'd to fix a problem generated chiefly by other cards. Horn of Gondor was errata'd to fix a problem generated by Horn of Gondor. Master of Lore, as it happens, was also errata'd to fix a problem chiefly generated by Horn of Gondor.

OK, I'll amend Horn to "niche card" instead of coaster.  If you chump-block as a strategy (or share a table with someone who does) it's a good card.  If you're playing a direct damage quest that's likely to destroy (not discard!) characters, it's a good card.  If neither applies, it's not worth the 1-cost or the restricted slot for a card that may never generate resources.  I dropped Horn out of my tactics deck when I replaced Winged Guardian with Defender of Rammas.

 

I'll also concede that Horn of Gondor was an essential part of the loop (though not the *only* essential part) that led to the unfortunate Master of Lore nerf.  Horn of Gondor was not errata-ed at that time, even though an exhaustion cost for Horn of Gondor would have solved the problem while still retaining its original function.

 

Speaking of original function, I'm not sure I buy the line that the nerf returns HoG to its "intended" function.  Horn of Gondor's "leave play" ability was particularly valuable to three archtypes -- Eagles, Rohan, and Silvan.  Silvan have *lots* of tools to exploit leaves play, and even without the Horn are plenty powerful.  Rohan and Eagles aren't on anyone's overpowered list, and many of the key cards for both came out in the *first cycle*.  Eagles are expensive, and I'm sure the designers *fully intended* for Horn of Gondor to recover some of the costs from those disappearing Eagles.

 

In 2016 when announcing the errata, Caleb Grace writes: 

 

Horn of Gondor has an important place in The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game, particularly in the Core Setexperience. The Tactics player is usually expected to engage enemies and defend their attacks in order to defeat them, but this often means that their allies are destroyed by those enemy attacks. Therefore, it is important to the Tactics player to have a way of gaining resources in order to play more allies to replace those losses. Horn of Gondor provides those resources by giving the attached hero a resource whenever a character leaves play. However, because its Response triggers “After a character leaves play…” instead of “After a character is destroyed…” it left its ability open to all types of abuses. The design team has corrected this by changing Horn of Gondor to read:“Response: After a character is destroyed, add 1 resource to attached hero’s pool.” We believe this errata balances the Horn of Gondor in the game while preserving its original intended use.

 

But back in 2013, a second breakfast by Caleb Grace appears here:

 

https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2013/3/19/second-breakfast/ [https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2013/3/19/second-breakfast/]

 

It's a spirit/tactics deck with 2x Horn of Gondor, and he recommends Horn of Gondor as one of five cards he uses for his mulligan decision, since it's his only source of resources.  Is that because of it's "original intended use?"

 

Potential chump blockers:

2x Gondorian Spearman

3x Envoy of Pelargir

 

Anti-chump defense:

2x Arwen Undomiel

3x Defender of Rammas

3x Great Yew Bow

3x Hands Upon the Bow

3x Feint

3x Light in the Dark

 

Leaves play:

3x Gandalf

3x Escort from Edoras

 

Seems to me the "intended use" relies on the original wording in this case, and likely many others.
