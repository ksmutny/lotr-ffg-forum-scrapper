It's released and on the quest log but not the deck builder yet =(

I may not have it yet (still a few weeks to go as I'm in Australia) but want to play around with the new cards in the deck builder at least :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

I found it strange too. Been checking it for quite a while.

It's not just me right, this still isn't up? Who do we complain to to get Tharbad on the deck builder?

Darksbane is a very busy man. He will get to it when he can.

The new cards from Trouble in Tharbad are now available in the deck builder.

Hm, I'm still not seeing them, either by searching for card names or by using the Trouble in Tharbad filter in the search options.  I do see the Trouble in Tharbad cards in the card spoilers section, but I can't remember if those have already been there for awhile.

 

I'm wondering also if there is a good way provide feedback for the deckbuilder-- there are some cards that are tagged under the wrong sphere, or not easily searchable because they use accented characters in the title (and typing the unaccented character doesn't bring them up).  Last year I sent feedback of this type directly to Darksbane, and it did get fixed after awhile, but I got no reply so I was not sure if my message was received.  Anyone know if there is an official way to send that kind of feedback, or should I just try messaging Darksbane again?

@GrandSpleen Clear your cache and refresh. That did it for me.

I just figured that out as well.  Tried Firefox and IE (which aren't my default browser) and it worked, so I cleared my Chrome cache and now I can see them.  Silly cache!
