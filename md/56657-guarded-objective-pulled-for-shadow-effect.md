 Ok, so I reveal the Shadow card dealt to an enemy and it is an Objective Card (Athelas) with the Guarded keyword. Now what? Is the card discarded at the end of the Combat Phase? Please help! THANKS!

Treat the card like you would treat any other card without a shadow effect.  Discard it without effect.

Time to explore a Forest Grove and get back the Athelas from the discard stack.

Reminds me of the Rhosgobel game where I had 2x Athelas and 2x Forest Grove hit the discard pile after being Shadow cards llorando.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/llorando.gif] .

If I explore the Forest Grove I can choose between the discard pile and the encounter deck to pluck an Athelas? Right?

Forest Grove card's text: "After the players explore Forest Grove, search the encounter deck and discard pile for 1 Athelas objective, and add it to the staging area. Then, shuffle the encounter deck. "

So you can choose. But why do you need to choose? I think every one searches the discard pile if there is at least one Athelas)))

Yep, you search the encounter deck and discard pile as a whole to select an Athelas of your choice. I notice the transcribed text on lotrlcg.com is missing the discard part, but its plain as can be on the card. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Obvious strategy musings:

The discard pile is naturally the better choice allowing further Athelas cards (purposely avoiding the plural of Athelas, you try it >.<) to appear from the encounter deck. Unless perhaps if you have another Forest Grove available to explore next and theres only one Athalas in the discard, then you could select from one from the encounter deck allowing yourself two assured Athelas.
