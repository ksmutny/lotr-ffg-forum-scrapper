Been playing the game on and off for a while, and was sure I had a handle on things, but I’m going through cards tonight deck building, and I’ve found myself questioning something.

Can Actions on Event cards be used regardless of sphere, or is it tied to them?

For example, the Event card Blade Mastery in the Core Set. It’s a Tactics Card with a cost of 1. I know it has to be paid for by a Tactics hero, but the card text says;

Action: Choose a Character. Until the end of the phase, that character gains +1 [Attack] and +1 [Defence].

When I choose a character, does it have to be a Tactics character, or can it be any character, now that the resource cost has been met?

Seems a simple enough thing, but now I’m thinking about it directly, I could argue an answer in either direction, so thought it’d be good to check!

You can go to my post (Attachment and event cards)....i asked something similar and it looks there are no restrictions based on sphere unless the card specifically says so. Only to get in play an attachment/event card you need to spend resources from a hero or heroes with the same sphere of influence. This is the only restriction for attachment/event cards to be brought in play?

It can be any character (hero or ally) you want, under any player’s control. Unless the character is immune to player card effects. It doesn’t matter the sphere.

And yes, unless it specificity says otherwise on the card. Like Burning Brand.

Brilliant, thanks both!

I'd assumed it was probably 'choose any Character' or it would specifically say. Back to the deck building I go!
