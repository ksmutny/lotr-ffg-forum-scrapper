 Hopefully it's an app. There's already a great database, but I'd love one for my iPod.

i like the idea, its nice to have everything in one place seeing as i use this forum exclusively

but im guessing its a move to stop people from going to cardgamedb- id rather they sped the software up

good, i hope the do it for all there card games... but i will wait and see.. whom eve dose the websites for ffg are lame as hell.. Everything they put up is a complete fail.. this forum and the quest log are good examples.

 ya the websites for ffg are awful. i dont refer to the design but the loading. it always takes FOREVER to load the pages. unless they sovle that issue i cant imagine id use any dB/deck builder they put out.

No they're not. It's just an add for the Quest Log.

i see, seems alot of effort to go through, just to make an add on, how is it going to work? i mean if you have to upload all the cards onto the site, you may as well make a database and do a good job of it
