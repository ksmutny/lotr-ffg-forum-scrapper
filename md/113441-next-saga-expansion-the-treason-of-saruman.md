I know nothing of Angmar, Lost Realms or whatsoever. Who dwells there? Of those, who will become the player cards - heroes, allies. etc. I mean.

Probably going to see some Witch-King action.

yes Angmar at last!!! Witch-King my favourite hero in Lotr!!!! I love to see that North Kingdom and see that War between Angmar and Arnor.....Maybe we will see a siege of Anuminas??????  and Legendary battle between Glorifindel and Wich-King?? When King flee with fear from Glorifindel??? Anyway very cool!!! Im so exiting!!! My childhood become alive!!!

Well, it's about time Dunedain got some synergy going on for them.

So freaking cool, they are going to really be able to continue to flex their creative muscle for the narrative for this. Lots of Dunedain support I'm guessing with likely a sprinkling of noldor along with a little of everything I'm sure. Very excited of course. And is the color of the box black? Fitting and full of suspense, someone needs to check that color thread from a few months ago to see who guessed it first.

Treason of Isengard: obviously awesome but hard to get too hyped about it since I doubt we'll see it for a very long time (if the road darkens timetable is any indicator)

Also interesting and I think a good and cool decision to make the fellowship hero Aragorn although I wonder how that affects if you were using him/or wanted to use him in campaign mode for previous and future quests

you just know the artwork for this cycle is going to be ******** awesome

 

whom do i kiss for coming up with this idea eh? haha

 

ps - interesting lore decisions to be made here, i need to check the appendices timeline, but we certainly shouldnt see the epic confrontation between glorfindel and witch king again (unless he went back for more? :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png])... but angmar was deserted i believe though its no way too much of a stretch to have it..as the box says.. awakened... and its said that the downs were awakened by the witch king also...

 

so, the storyline... perhaps we start off in rivendell.? and instead of saruman this time its gandalf

 

 

spoiler.............................

 

(as the current storyline shows we are heading west for this anyways after our business in isengard is done)

mt gundabad is close to angmar, so more goblins... :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] who said they wanted more?!

Actually story Frodo and Sam spit here with story of Others members of fellowship... so it mean there will be story only about Aragorn Glimly Legolas and Others

I believe I heard them say "early next year" for Treason of Isengard.  So... probably Q3.  But that would at least be sooner than Road Darkens.

Wow, there's so much new stuff... pretty excited. The Lost Realm will be great, it was basically what people were expecting, the northern realms, Angmar, Rangers, evil spirits, pretty cool! Looking forward to this cycle. Treason of Saruman seems like it'll be awesomely epic. Battle of the Hornburg at last! What I'm curious to see is how they'll handle the new Fellowship hero Aragorn. He'll obviously not be a ring-bearer, that's for sure, and since he'll become king later we have to protect him. An equivalent to Frodo ringbearer basically, makes sense. But how will this work with the other Frodo saga heroes? I suppose you still have to have a ring-bearer, but at the same time Aragorn? How will that work?

I'm obviously aware of how the storyline proceeds; I was trying to convey rather how I found it interesting that it seems they will leave out a "ring-bearer" rather than trying to work Frodo and Sam's journey in just for the sake of doing it but firmly splitting each saga expansion as each "book" is

Didn't we get some card spoilers or back of the box spoilers from "voice of Isen" at last years gen-con? Here's hoping they have a model flipped over for the attendees to check out

The good news is that Lotr LCG has been confirmed as one of FFG best selling products! So it's safe tto assume they will be supporting the game for a long time to come.

Cool stuff!

I really like the lost realm box art.

Now lets have some card spoilers! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

So Tactics Aragorn... Most of us were expecting Leadership and Spirit to be the heroes in The Lost Realm, but this seems cool! Can anyone read any of card's abilities? Also I hope the other hero is Leadership Halbarad.

 

Edit: Aragorn says "Enemies engaged with you get -1 defence. After Aragorn participates in an attack that destroys an enemy, choose an enemy not engaged with you and engage that enemy."

Wooohoooo...!

 

Aragorn can get 4 spheres without songs now. Celebrian Stone, Sword Broken and Ring of Barahir... Yeah!

 

I see another tactics hero in the below image, 2 aragorns?..., 2nd with 0 threat?

Tactics Aragorn!

 

Dunedain. Ranger. Warrior.

Each enemy engaged with you get -1 Defense.

Response: After Aragorn participates in an attack that destroys an enemy, choose an enemy not engaged with you and engage that enemy.
