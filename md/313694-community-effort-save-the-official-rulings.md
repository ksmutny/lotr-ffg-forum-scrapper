Hello community,

As you all now by now, FFG forums will be shutting down [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/313578-ffg-forum-shutdown/]. Thus, a lot of interesting information and official rulings given by designers in the rules section could be lost.

A community effort is undertaken, you can fill in that form, here with all the rulings you might find/know of in those forums:

http://lotr-lcg-quest-companion.gamersdungeon.net/ruling_archive.php [http://lotr-lcg-quest-companion.gamersdungeon.net/ruling_archive.php]

All of those rulings will be made available on the Quest Companion when this is over.

Thank you for your help.
