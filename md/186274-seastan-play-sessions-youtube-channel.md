Hey everyone,

 

I decided to start up a similar thread to Glaurung, where I post my play sessions with some commentary.

 

I love deckbuilding and card combinations, so right now I plan to mainly focus on exploring fun new deck ideas, but it could turn into the kind of thing where I take one deck through a campaign. Who knows.

 

The first deck in the spotlight is one I call Beravor's Path. It's a solo Dunedain deck that can be quite powerful. The quest is Nightmare Journey Down the Anduin.

(It seems that, unbeknownst to me, OCTGN game sounds were turned on when I recorded, so there is an annoying clicking noise when I perform actions. I apologize. This will be gone in future videos.)

A thing to consider:

 

Wargs.png [https://s3.amazonaws.com/hallofbeorn-resources/Images/Cards/Core-Set/Wargs.png]

 

It looks like you were discarding his shadow cards without looking at them because he attacked Beravor with the Burning Brand, but for his ability it doesn't matter if a shadow effect triggers or not, because the wording is "dealt".

 

EDIT: You realized that later in the video, but there was another mistake. You deal shadow cards from left to right, not by the enemies engagement costs.

Thanks. Have you finished the video? I noticed that on the third turn or so and went back in the log to see if the shadow cards had any effect, and for the rest of the video I check every turn and move him appropriately.

Yeah, read the "EDIT" section of my previous post.

> EDIT: You realized that later in the video, but there was another mistake. You deal shadow cards from left to right, not by the enemies engagement costs.

 

I guess I've learned my lesson. This wasn't so much a "mistake" as just negligence. I didn't think people wanted to watch me sort out 7+ shadow cards every turn. But you're absolutely right.

## 7 [John Constantine on August 26, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/186274-seastan-play-sessions-youtube-channel/?do=findComment&comment=1757591)

Well, in this case it had direct gameplay implication as it decided whether Warg will stay engaged or return to the staging area.

## 8 [Seastan on August 27, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/186274-seastan-play-sessions-youtube-channel/?do=findComment&comment=1757604)

Sure, but not having looked at the order of the encounter deck means I'm not gaining any advantage. And it's not like I was short on willpower either. I could go back and check what shadow card he should have received every turn, and commit the appropriate willpower. But thanks for the tip, I will try to be more careful next time.

Its always nice to see a good player taking on nightmare quests but above all, I am grateful for your posting your lists! I am pretty average as a deckbuilder and good decks (that is, nightmare worthy ) are hard to find. Though I did put together a Beorn-Glorfindel-Eowyn that eventually won Nightmare JDtA. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

Looking forward to future updates.

Ok I sow your session during a bus trip to Bangkok. Quite cool I like it! Your deck is really good and solid. The only problem is crazy boring for me to play such decks since you dont really play a game. You just put a cards in the table and play with your self. Encounter deck cannot do much against you!

this kind of Decks is still possible even with ertatas POl and Beravur…. Still Burning brand also to much powerful! Anyway is up to players use this kind of deck if they like. In coop this combo probablty will not work couse encounter deck plau much quicker!

Anyway good video I like it. Keep on!

I look forward to watching this. It is always interesting to see how other people play the game and hopefully I will pick up a new trick or two.

Thanks for the feedback! Yes, it's definitely a "control deck" and not everyone likes to play that way. I was just trying to experiment with solo dunedain decks and this is what happened!

Dont get me wrong! Very good play through and cool deck! I really like it! Just as a Tolkien fan I like more actions and struggle! Your idea to use Path card is awesome!

Glad you enjoyed it. This will be the theme of the channel for now. Exploring deck ideas apart from the common Gandalf/Silvan/Dwarf powerhouses.

I could NEVER build a good control deck... and always end up being played by the game... which can be a good thing (more variety in gameplay) or a bad thing (redoing the same quests until you puke).

When were the rules on dealing Shadow cards changed? And can someone point me to the source? I checked the 1.7 FAQ and didn't notice anything about changing Shadow card distribution from the Core rules, which state that Shadow cards are dealt by order of highest engagement cost to lowest. From the Core Rulebook:

 

At the beginning of the combat phase, the players deal 1 shadow card to each engaged enemy. Deal the top card of the encounter deck, face down, to each engaged enemy. When dealing cards to a single player’s enemies, always deal to the enemy with the highest engagement cost first. Cards should first be dealt to the enemies attacking the first player, and then proceed around the board until all enemies have 1 card.

 

Or am I missing something?

 

Thanks!

Yes, the thing you're missing is: in my post I described the way he was dealing shadow cards, which was incorrect.

Hmm, didn't watch the video, maybe that will explain it.

I think you might have misread John's original post. He was pointing out that, rather than deal shadow cards correctly (by engagement cost), for part of the video the dealing was done left to right by mistake.

 

Even if that clears things up, don't let that stop you from watching Seastan's video.

****, I didn't realise shadow cards are dealt by engagement cost. I actually thought you could choose the order in which they are dealt! Whoops. Well at least I know now.

Brilliant deck and play. If I had just read the deck list I would have ignored it as a bad pile of cardboard.

> ****, I didn't realise shadow cards are dealt by engagement cost. I actually thought you could choose the order in which they are dealt! Whoops. Well at least I know now.

You choose the order of attacking enemies and can strategically defend certain attacks first/last but with shadow cards you must always deal them from highest to lowest engagement for each player in order (obviously starting with the first player).

Great video. The clicking cracked me up to start with but I got used to it quite quickly.

 

I don't think I've ever been in a position where one hero could defend multiple attacks, let alone repeatedly take attacks from a troll. Blood of Numenor seems incredible. Great stuff.

You weren't using Northern Tracker's response early on. Was that so you could do the location swap if needed?

## 28 [Seastan on August 28, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/186274-seastan-play-sessions-youtube-channel/?do=findComment&comment=1760804)

> You weren't using Northern Tracker's response early on. Was that so you could do the location swap if needed?

 

Yes that's right.

 

There's an alternate version of the deck that I briefly mentioned in the video, where you include a few extra cards like Song of Battle and Gondorian Fire. It plays a little differently because you just use Path of Need to buy time to get Beravor powered up with Blood, Fire, and some ready effects like UC and Miruvor. In this case you just kill everything, clear the staging locations with your Trackers, and once Path of Need is gone you don't really care anymore.

 

But having played both ways I think the location swapping is more fun. And I've been using Gondorian Fire as a bit of a crutch lately in all my decks so I wanted to get away from that.

Yup, that's where I was confused. I thought he meant that the correct way to deal Shadow cards was left to right. But he was saying that in the video Seastan was dealing the cards from left to right instead of by highest EC to lowest EC.

 

I'll try to watch the video soon.

My second video is now up and in it I will be taking a looking at a card combo that makes heavy use of Emery. It works best with 2+ players, so I have built 2 decks.

Nice. I don't even feel like this should be erratad, as this is a co-op game, and I don't see anybody actually going through playing this deck over and over again against different quests just to beat 'em all with no effort. I do feel, however, that Emery should and will be erratad soon to limit attempting to play her for once per round or something similar, because her combo with the valour Rallying Cry is obviously unintended, and will have a huge effect on the forthcoming Nolder-related discard mechanics.

Why? I see many times in other card games(for example AGOT or previous lotr lcg) start with unlimited draw and eventually come to draw limit.

Maybe I didn't understood something but im pretty sure hand size or draw limit will help

## 38 [John Constantine on September 3, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/186274-seastan-play-sessions-youtube-channel/?do=findComment&comment=1771352)

See, the draw limit is aimed to hamper the "overpowered overdraw" decks, but it will indirectly affect all other types of decks that have some sort of card draw and are far from being anything like overpowered. In fact, things like Mithrandir's Advice, Peace and Thought, Sarn Ford Sentry and others might stop functioning as intended at all. The endless draw exists because of the loopholes in the card design, innocent people should not get harmed because of it.

I have been eagerly awaiting the discard mechanics because the easiest way to build combos so far has been through the discard pile. I already have several ideas for the upcoming Galadhrim Weaver.

 

I think it can be very hard to design balanced cards for a co-op game. In competitive games you can release a very powerful card, and sometimes it does need errata but other times you just have to introduce counters for it. There is no countering in this game - in fact quite the opposite. The other player can build their deck specifically to help you achieve the combo rather than counter it.

 

I think my next video will be more tame, nothing broken.

Sorry for negative feedback, don't get me wrong, I enjoy your videos, but it's kinda not fun for me to watch through all that thought process blanks. It probably would be too much work to do, but for me at the very least your videos would be dozen times more watchable with all the idle moments edited out.

It's true, editing it down would take a significant amount of time and result in less videos overall. I could certainly play faster - what takes the most amount of time is saying my thoughts aloud. If people aren't too interested in that aspect I can consider releasing some videos that are played back at 2x speed with just a voice over summary added in after.

If we look at the history of the game, they do typically shut these things down with errata somehow. Sadly it's often done in a way that nerfs one of the cards out of use. *cough* Master of Lore *cough*

If Love of Tales was "Once per turn...", would that really make it unplayable?  Of course it would no longer be game breaking, but it still seems like a decent resource card in a song archetype.

Seastan, that was brilliant. Scary, but brilliant. I'm not sure I will ever look at the game the same way again. You broke it twelve ways to Sunday.

For the people who haven't watched it yet, spoiler alert, but it takes him nearly 50 minutes to get to the first quest phase, by which point the game is already over.

That was just insane.

> What happened to the Master of Lore, by the way? Why he was broken and how they made him useless? I never actually used that card to take any notice.

Master of Lore used to reduce the cost of a player card type (Ally, Attachment, Event) by 1.  There was no limit to this reduction so you could choose "ally" and combine it with the Legacy of Durin, Erebor Hammersmith, Born Aloft, Horn of Gondor, combination and draw your entire deck for free!

 

They limited it to only reducing the cost of the first card of the chosen type by 1.

Master of Lore (without faq limit) + Hammersmith + Born aloft + Horn of Gondor + Legacy Durin = infinite draw cards (with their consequences)

also with Nori = infinite decreasing threat

Thanks for the feedback!

 

 

> What happened to the Master of Lore, by the way? Why he was broken and how they made him useless? I never actually used that card to take any notice.

 

Others have mentioned what made him broken. So they limited his cost reduction to the first card you play. Now look at the card as it is now: It's a 3 cost ally, so it will take 3 turns just to break even with how much you spent on him. If you want to use him to reduce the cost of allies or attachments, you must exhaust him in the resource phase, which means you are asking for a 1 hit point ally to make it through 3 quest phases while exhausted. We all know how that's going to turn out.

 

If they had limited it to just the first 3 cards, for example, they could allow you to recoup the cost of the card in just 1 turn, which makes it on par with many other resource-generators, and at the same time shut down the combo.

I like that better than the existing version, but I'd still limit the ability to Lore cards to limit what could be some universal and crazy reliable cost reduction (if you combine with Theoden, Grima, O Lorien, etc)

It's hard to say. In my opinion, the only decks where Love of Tales is playable are in these kinds that try to break the game. I don't see anyone using them in regular play. 

 

If it were up to me, I'd make Love of Tales: Attach to a Lore hero. Limit 1 per hero. Response: After a Song card is played, add 1 resource to attached hero's resource pool and draw 1 card (Limit once per round).

 

I think this would make LoT decks very strong, but not broken. It might see more use because your song cards wouldn't slow down your deck.

"It's hard to say. In my opinion, the only decks where Love of Tales is playable are in these kinds that try to break the game. I don't see anyone using them in regular play."

 

I began using the card in my proxy Erestor, Círdan, Boromir deck, running Song of Wisdom, Travel, Eärendil and Lay of Nimrodel. With the Noldor card draw, supported by Master of the Forge, this has become very useful for me. But it is basically the first time I made it work. I usually play 2-player so Eärendil makes even more sense there, but even in solo, once you get a piece of Love of Tales, it is a 0-cost (possible favourable resource transfer) for 1 card. Lay of Nimrodel is especially cool if you play it from a different hero than the one you are boosting (who has the Love attached).

 

The good thing about this strategy is that many decks use songs without focus on them: O Lórien! for instance, so that you get a benefit from it without really losing slots. Also, more songs are coming, the recent Hope Rekindled may not be an issue yet but perhaps will be one day, and I really hope the Tale of Tinúviel will be a strong card.

 

That said, in my 8 decks I run currently, there is not a copy of Rivendell Minstrel. Do others use her?

And yeah, Master of Lore should cost two. I would not like him to be "discard a card" dependent since he is Gondor but as he is right now, it is a very weak card, I feel.

## 67 [John Constantine on September 28, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/186274-seastan-play-sessions-youtube-channel/?do=findComment&comment=1822840)

By discarding a card I tried to describe him belonging to Lore (a card draw rich sphere that wouldn't mind discarding some stuff), plus it's a replacement for exhaustion, which makes him vulnerable to many nasty things.

## 68 [Fingolfin Fate on September 29, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/186274-seastan-play-sessions-youtube-channel/?do=findComment&comment=1824511)

It would be a much stronger card, no doubt. And I get the Lore thing, though the Lore thing right now is that allies exhaust to do stuff: Henamarth Riversong, Master of the Forge, Gléowine, Ithilien Tracker, Anborn...

Fun deck.  I enjoyed the video, but oof!  When you got the treachery that sent all enemies back to the staging area and then they re-engaged you, that would have added their threat to the total threat in the staging area (so 9 versus your 4) and you would have threated out.  Fortunately, you could have cancelled with A Test of Will but it would have changed how combat went on the next 3 turns.  You would have been able to defend everything but it would have taken a bit longer to clear all the enemies you had.  Also, you would have had to spend an extra two resources to maintain the current state of the game as it was in the video because of spending for A Test of Will and because of needing to boost Bilbo's attack (or maybe defense, I would have to re-watch it) on a future turn as a result of spending the 1 resource on A Test of Will earlier.  It would not have affected your questing push on stage 2B (you would have had exactly enough progress to complete it) but thought mentioning how I think that treachery is supposed to work might be helpful.

That treachery's interaction with the nightmare card effect is one I hadn't considered before. I happens around 26:00 into the video. There are two easy ways to resolve this. One is, as you mentioned, cancelling it with a test of will. The resource I spent on Gondorian Fire that turn was useless anyway, because Gandalf could of just joined Bilbo in his attack that turn. So Bilbo would end up with the same resources as before. A second option would be to just sneak Gandalf in during the questing phase rather than the combat phase to either kill an enemy that ambushed me or to lower my threat. Either way, I don't threat out, and I don't mind the lack of Gandalf in the combat phase, as it later shows.

 

But thanks for pointing out this very tricky card interaction! Glad you enjoyed the video.

Thanks! Nice to hear you enjoyed the random hero selection. I have started a forum game based on the concept: https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/190886-a-random-walk-to-mordor-1/ [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/190886-a-random-walk-to-mordor-1/]

 

 

> Interesting deck

 

Haha please try to contain your excitement!  ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

 

 

So a little backstory behind the deck. I was mainly trying to come up with a deck that would have a solid chance at beating NM Steward's Fear on a regular basis. It's such a tough goal because you need lots of willpower to overcome location lock, yet there is such brutal ally hate that it's almost impossible to build up a legion of allies (I even tried outlands...). So a deck that would have a high success rate would have to have few allies, which means mostly attachments and events. But the only way you can get truly high levels of willpower with just heroes is through Lay of Nimrodel, which needs resources.

 

So that leads to needing Steward of Gondor, which leads to needing songs and tons of card draw. In comes Erestor and Beravor, and to deal with combat we needs lots of attack, defense, and action advantage. This leads naturally to Bilbo, Fast Hitch, Gondorian Fire, Blood of Numenor, and Burning Brand.

 

It turns out when you have a deck that does well at Stewards Fear, you can handle a lot of other quests too :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png].

Edit: I ran out of cards in my deck, not my hand, and this does not cause a loss. Nothing wrong with this - in fact it seems to be a good strategy for dealing with this quest as you avoid Saruman's extra attacks because you can't draw cards.

This is why I hate the Fall of Gil-Galad. This could have been such an amazing card, but nooooo! The Limit 1 per deck is not enough, lets make it trigger only off heroes being destroyed! Leaving play would be too OP!

Honestly, it might be a little OP with heroes like Caldara and Tactics Boromir (maybe).  Those two heroes aside, I do think it would be quite fine to have it trigger on a hero leaving play and not just destroyed.  With Caldara it's basically like having a 1 Cost card for 8 threat reduction because you're gonna discard her anyway.  So after you Fortune or Fate you've effectively paid 6 resources for two 4 cost allies and 8 threat reduction.  But I'd be okay with Caldara decks getting more love :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Such situationality is nothing to be afraid of when we are talking about a non-recoverable (goes into the victory display, so you can't bring it back from there to play it again), limit 1 per deck card. I'd rather have 2-3 heroes that this card is especially good on, than having a lot of situation when this card simply doesn't works (like it shouldn't have worked in this video).

## 86 [Seastan on November 3, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/186274-seastan-play-sessions-youtube-channel/?do=findComment&comment=1876524)

I agree. It would be a really cool card to have in quests where you know you will be sacrificing a hero. How great would it be in a Journey in the Dark?

 

I've tried thinking of ways you could use it with Treebeard. Maybe start with Treebeard to get a strong start, then he can kill himself with damage and lower your threat by 13 when you get near the threat cap? I don't know if this would be any good.

## 87 [John Constantine on November 3, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/186274-seastan-play-sessions-youtube-channel/?do=findComment&comment=1876551)

Of all things, it's not even reliable. 1 card per deck means you won't even bee seeing that card some of the games, unless you run a draw heavy deck. 

## 88 [Seastan on November 3, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/186274-seastan-play-sessions-youtube-channel/?do=findComment&comment=1876561)

Well, if you do come up with a strategy around it, you can always include Rivendell Minstrel to obtain it more reliably.

Too much effort to simply lower your threat by the loss of a hero :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

I'd rather pay resources for some threat-lowering card (or include Loragorn) and be done with it.

No good unfortunately-- The Great Bridge says you have to 'discard' a hero for its effect, which wouldn't work for The Fall of Gil-Galad's trigger (which says the hero must have been "destroyed").

Great new video on Reinforcements. 

 

If you brought in Balin to help with card draw/consistency, how many King Under the Mountains would you add, and what would you recommend removing? The current deck seems to have a pretty tight synergy.

 

I'm hesitant to pull allies, so my best guess is Good Harvest.

 

I look forward to working with the deck this weekend!

Thanks!

 

I don't like the idea of Balin because he slows it down. If you drop Theodred you give up resources, if you drop Aragorn you lose action advantage, if you drop Amarthiul you lose tactics. Then you have to spend 2 resources on King Under the mountain and also fill the deck with other copies of it. The deck is all about a speedy start, and I do recognize that having KUtM in the opening hand can help you draw into A Very Good Tale, but I'm not sold on it yet.

 

So far the card draw hasn't been a problem for me, but I guess you could try putting in Valiant Sacrifice.  Then I'd drop Treebeard, Haldir, and maybe 1x Descendant.

But luckily I have a lot of videos queued up so I can continue to publish them over the break, probably on Mondays and Fridays. Decks coming up soon, in no particular order, are Rohan, mono-tactics, Dunhere, more traps and more Dunedain.

So I brought my physical cards with me over the holidays, and decided to do a special New Year's episode. I also play new format which I call "Minimum Purchase Mode", which is where you only include cards from the minimum number of products required to play the scenario (and 1 core set only). That means anyone playing the scenario is able to build the deck.

 

First quest in this new mode of play is Shadow and Flame: Link to video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhsdemT5paE]

Hey Seastan,

 

Really like the new video and the idea of "minimum purchase mode". I've only got through Dwarrowdelf and the two Hobbit expansions so stuff like that helps.

 

I admit, I have a soft spot for videos that use the actual cards so I will be sad that you are going back to the computer, haha. I understand it is probably much easier for video purposes on your end though.

Of course not, but I've never seen Gloin or Rossiel decks quite like yours either. Granted, the big difference tends to be Arwen, Elven Light, and Protector of Lorien to also buff up at the same time you're drawing a half dozen cards. I guess once you've seen that combo, you want to include it in every deck.

I am saying this now. Spirit Pippin is underrated. He could even work as a spirit Glorfindel reserve (in the Boromir deck). Think of it. Glorfindel has a low threat cost, high willpower and high attack, but no ability, except "Raise your threat by one", if you not get first turn LoV . Pippin has low starting threat (only 1 higher than Glorfindel), 2 willpower, very low attack and no ability at all. You lose one willpower and the attack power, but you win  either a better start if you not need to mulligan for LoV or you win some threat. In the Boromir deck, attack is not the biggest problem. With GF, Boromir attacks for 20-40, all by himself. You lose 1 willpower, which is bad, but WE ARE SPEAKING OF REPLACING SPIRIT GLORFINEL WITH SPIRIT PIPPIN! Changing a overpowered hero to possibly the worst hero in the game has a downside. In Multiplayer, the cons (losing willpower) and be covered by other players, now when they are able to use Glorfindel or LoV. The deck will suffer, but not so much as you would think.

Yes, Merry fills that role better, but if someone is playing secrecy and using him, Pippin is an alternative. Before Merry was released Pippin was a "bad" hero. I do not say that Pippin is a very good hero, he´s just not as bad as everyone says he is. Useful sphere, low threat and 2 willpower, not great but not the worst.

 

I once built a deck with the theme "Boromir and the dunedain allies guard Pippin and Merry", using spirit Merry and spirit Pippin (I do not own black riders yet, so I had no alternatives). That deck showed me how underrated he is.

I don't know, I feel like this is getting into similar territory to that thread a while back saying Dori was OK (Not mndela's one, the one before that) where it boiled down to "He's better than nothing." Spirit Pippin is certainly better than nothing, but he's not really better than anything else. He has arguably the most powerful hero ability, that of generating a resource every round, but he doesn't have anything else except maybe in some really specific circumstances (and even there you could probably do better with another hero).

## 127 [DurinVoronwe on April 10, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/186274-seastan-play-sessions-youtube-channel/?do=findComment&comment=2160507)

Yes, this feels like the Dori discussion, but Pippin has something Dori lack. Low threat. With his low starting threat, you can play him alongside strong heroes like Elrond, Gandalf and Boromir, but Dori has too high starting threat. The sphere is also a very different matter, tactics is (in most cases) the worst sphere, when spirit is (in most cases) the best sphere. Pippin is way better than Dori, and mostly better than Bombur or Brand.

 

See it from a different perspective, would you think a newly spoiled low threat spirit hero with a not great ability. Would you think that hero has a place in the game?

 

I am no Seastan, so do not expect me to build a good deck around him, I just feel that he is not that "bad" hero everyone thinks he is.

A challenge for a better deckbuilder than me, build a good spirit Pippin deck!

I have tried building a Spirit Pippin deck before, because I think it would be fun to show it on the channel. All my attempts have been to actually use his ability though, not just to use him as a low threat spirit stand-in (because what is the fun in using him without his ability).

> Pippin is way better than Dori, and mostly better than Bombur or Brand.

No. No. Emphatically no. I need a word that is a stronger negative than no.

Yes, Pippin is low threat, but the reason his threat is lower than those other heroes you mention is because he has stats to match. And yes, Pippin is Spirit, but there are plenty of other Spirit heroes you can use. There is nothing Spirit Pippin can do which would make him a better choice for a deck than literally any other Spirit hero (or if your willpower is a concern then any other 2+ wp Spirit hero); whereas Dori's and Brand's abilities, while niche, have definite uses which can make them good fits for certain decks and certain contexts, not to mention their useful stats. Bombur's ability isn't even niche, it's central to Dwarf strategy since it helps you hit 5 Dwarves as fast as possible.

Agreed. It's hard to say if a Spirit hero is weaker than a tactics hero, as the sphere have different roles, but it is no question that Pippin is the worst Spirit hero. Pippin quests for 2 thats all. Bombur defends well (natural fit for brand!) and Supports dwarfs and Brand is a decend attacker has ranged and a situational ability. Dori defends. Dori and Pippin are both mono-dimensionel, but I value defending over questing (imo there are more good Questers than Defenders) and Dori has the dwarf Support.

 

Spirit Pippin is the worst.

If you're not gonna use Pippin's ability, then he's absolutely outclassed by both spirit Glorfindel and spirit Merry, specially Merry

Strangely enough, Spirit Pippin has some interesting synergy with Lore Pippin. Then his ability essentially reads "Encounter Action: Raise your threat by 3 to draw a card." Could be interesting, especially paired with Spirit Merry.
