booored's deck using zigil 'ziggy' inspired my to try my own solo deck

bilbo(or beravor)/eowyn/bifur

main two allies - zigil miner and longbeard map maker

basically get the miner to get those resources for you, then pile them onto bifur. also use his payment per turn to get an extra resource

the rest is obviously simple, buff up map makers will power till you pop....

also in my deck is protector of lorien, put that on eowyn and use bilbos extra card draw (which is also good for getting those two allies out early) to buff her willpower up

add to this some rohan goodness- escort from edoras - and you're laughing

all this card discarding will mean an extra thick deck though.....im still experimenting with this one so let me know thoughts

if your buffing map maker so much why would you need to use ewyoen? Seams a total waste. Put in Elenor maybe for treachery control or somthing.

good point....im still playing with which heros to choose to go with it, i think though keeping eowyn in still gives it that extremely fast questing power, so she still has her place there- for those times like solo RTM which i posted...just fly through it.

for others though im thinking frodo may be a good alternative

You play solo only don't you rich? I did a test with mapmaker and that is CRAZY powerful. The idea of the original deck was to fuel everyone else in the team, 2 or 3 players. So that deck is basically meant to be a resource engine for everyone else and they would play guys like that.,.. but did a solo thing with mapmaker and it was kinda insane. I defiantly do not think you need Eyowen. I think Protector can even be used soly as a defensive boost, rather than questing power as you can quest so hard with mapmaker. I'm going to make a new version for solo with mapmaker as well, and also take out some of teh 5 cost cards that are there just for resource gain and replace them with 4 cost ones... Like Beekeepers.

I'm thinking Thalin, Elonore and Bilbo/Beravor, or mabey swap Thalin for Dunhere/Denathor

yeah i do.....i like the idea of using protector as a defense, and put it on a high defense character- denethor maybe, im starting to think that zigil miner was perhaps a mistake on FFG's behalf, it should have been unqiue i think

It could be to early to say that, but it has defiantly changed the game.. drastically and some might say that is a good thing, that there is defiant change form expansion to expansion. People are very quick to say a card should be banned or w/e but lets see exactly what happens with the next AP cycle before we cry. I mean Steward is powerful as well, UC+Plate+Gloin. Still it dose seam crazy powerful. Though that can always be offset by powerful encounter decks.. maybe they are setting us up for ubr more complex quest!

I think this is the right idea. For instance, we've already seen a previewed enemy from the upcoming cycle (in The Road to Rivendell, I think) that has the ambush keyword and discards attachments when it engages a player. That could potentially make life very difficult for decks based around Steward of Gondor. As for Zigil Miner, it is an undoubtedly powerful card. That being said, it is an ally with one health that must exhaust to use its ability. There are plenty of cards (mostly treacheries, but also shadow effects like that on Hummerhorns and enemies like Mirkwood Bats) that simply kill it outright. It's very, very good, but also pretty fragile. 

My point, I guess, is that we're starting to see encounter card effects that seem designed to limit or neutralize some of the more powerful cards in the current environment. I wouldn't be surprised to see a location/enemy/treachery that really mucks with the Zigil Miner combo.

i like these ideas. its as if FFG is playing with us by releasing it early, allowing us to use it and get used to it, then release some crazy treachery cards that put it down a huge step or two- to me this is good- it shows a good relationship between designer and player, meaning we constantly have to re-think our playing strategy- keeping the game ever fresh
