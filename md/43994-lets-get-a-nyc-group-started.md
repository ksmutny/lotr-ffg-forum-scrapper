Now that the release date is getting close (or so I have been told), I want to start promoting this game at Metropolitan Wargamers in Brooklyn, NY.  http://www.nycwargames.com [http://www.nycwargames.com]

I'd also like to see some active players in Nassau County.  We already have enthusiastic AGOT and Cthulhu players, but I want to see LOTR get up to speed quickly.  And I think it is going to take some demo games to convince people they want to play this co-op format.

Any takers?

 I'm from the Bronx, sadly I'm stuck living in Puerto Rico for the time being, but I plan on moving back to NY later this year, I'd love to be a part of a gaming group.
