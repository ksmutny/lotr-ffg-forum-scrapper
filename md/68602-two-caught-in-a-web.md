# [Two caught in a web?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/68602-two-caught-in-a-web/)

Had two Caught in a Web cards come up in rapid succession.  Didn't see any thing in the rules or on the card that said I couldn't have two Caught in a Web cards on one hero, so put them both on one hero.  Question now is, do I have to pay 4 resource tokens to refresh him or just two?  (Fearing the answer.)

You would indeed have to pay 4 resources in order to ready the hero. However, it's often a good idea to attach multiple copies of Caught in a Web to the same hero. Although it becomes prohibitively difficult to ready that single character, it's frequently better than having TWO heroes ensnared at the same time (and being forced to pay for both).

Quoting the FAQ is a bit more constructive, don't you think ?

Q: How does a player resolve the situation in which a single hero has multiple copies of Caught in a Web (CORE 80) attached?
A: The player must pay for each copy of Caught in a Web before the hero can ready. Each copy of the card creates an independent condition that must be fulfilled

Quoting the relevant part of the FAQ might be good for resolving this particular question; however, the players should know that there is such a document out there and go to read it in order to play the game as it is designed.

I am aware of the FAQ, have downloaded it and have read both the old and newest version.  I forgot that this is already addressed there.  Sorry - heat of the moment posting.  sonrojado.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sonrojado.gif]
