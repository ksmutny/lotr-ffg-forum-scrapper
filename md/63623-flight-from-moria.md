 Just played 2 player "Flight from Moria" final Kazad-Dum scenario. Wow!!!! Intense and really good. Had to do a last ditch effort to win and pulled it off EXACTLY with no previous set up. I was down to one character left. Sooooooo Close

 Games like that are always the best. I've had a few like that and it just makes you want to stand up and cheer.
