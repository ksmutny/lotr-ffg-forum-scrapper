GenCon Update! The GenCon exclusive quest this year is named "The Old Forest." Here's the description: "Escape the agents of Mordor in the Old Forest at the Lord of the Rings Fellowship Event! You must bring your own deck to participate. All participating players will receive one free copy of the Old Forest Quest. Players participate in this event as part of a 2-player team. If you do not have a team, we will do our best to match you with another available player (no guarantees). If you are paired with another player, be prepared to adjust your deck accordingly, to prevent duplicate Heroes."

I'm sure it would fit in nicely between a shadow if the past and a knife in the dark, not unlike how the battle of lake tone filled the gap between the lonely mountain and the battle of 5 armies (although that was somewhat backwards because I think we got lake tone before the 2nd hobbit box ha)

It does, but I'd like rules to actively support it (rather than just being able to do it myself) - I'd like the POD expansion to come with extra boons for example.

 

On a related note I'd really like to see a "campaign" POD for the mirkwood cycle I really think the linking of quests in the lotr saga is the best thing the game has done yet,

Maybe not Mirkwood because it's thematically the weakest, but Against the Shadow and Dwarrowdwelf could both be played as campaigns and - with boons and banes added by a POD expansion they could be really fun. (Another way to breath new life into the old quests, as the nightmare expansions are).

That would be pretty sweet. Given the strong narrative structure in against the cycle if I had to choose I think that would be a great place to implement it. Although we're likely still a long ways off from seeing that as POD

Not only easy but also nothing special. .. no interesting mechanic nothing. it can be usual quest in the cycle. POD suppose to be something special and hard. Hope Old Forest will be something more then : play once and put on shelf and forget. MAO is after 2 years still very cool one ane Lake Town too. Last POD with undead not even have a proper topic on the forum. so no one really pay much attention to that example of lazy and und negligenty designers job.

This actually makes me sad because what they will now likely do is to have Bombadil as an objective only and not a player card. Unless of course, and then I would rejoice greatly, they will have both. If the next cycle is the Shire, then I hope we will get Tomb Bombadil (and Goldberry, of course) as allies -- I care not how much restricted they are, just as long we have them.

 

As for the cycle, it makes a perfect sense now, to have the Shire and the whole Eriador for the adventure packs, it is one area this game have little been to (except in the saga).

 

As for Bombadil and Goldberry, they seem to be the last two major characters still left out, save perhaps Thranduil.

Well I really liked the art of the Stone of Erech. But that was as far as my interested in the POD went. And I agree both Massing at Osgiliath and the Battle of Lake-town are excellent. The former I must have played over two hundred times now.

Oh no! I actually liked Stone of Erech! I thought the whole time thing was an interesting mechanic! Though I can't help but agree, MaO is still one of the best quests out there!

The Hate for Stone of Erech comes from veteran players who thinks that all new quests should aim to break all your teeth and accept no excuses.

I guess in general, maybe. But not for me. I actually quite dislike the whole POD. I think I spend a lot of money already on the game when I buy every expansion. But I am sort of a deck-building maniac, so I when I purchase a box, I always wants to see new player cards, together with new quests. I got Lake-town as a gift, and I printed Osgiliath myself. Erech just was not intriguing enough. The Old Forest just might be.

Yes doesn matter how you look on it SOE is a bad quest and im pretty sure sells nymber pretty few.....

I have all Lotr product until now but now I don't wonna buy everything straight away as before. now I will look first on product since quality if some quest is not so good. and SOE very good example. waste of my money....

SoE is decent. Interesting mechanics, immersive theme. Just not as hard as some people wish it was, especially for a PoD quest.

I like SoE for its thematic value and for the artwork. But as for the difficulty complaints, I do understand Glaurung and other seasoned players. I am looking for thematic quests and opportunity to run some themed decks, but others are looking for a hard logic puzzle. I think it is hard to entertain both groups at once: sky high difficulty kills thematic decks (save for outlands obvoisly, and dwarfs, to an extent).

So how will the new PoD quest land in this context? obviously we cannot know. The theme for it sounds fun but then again I am excited for every expansion FFG creates.

SOE is a great quest, it has the best time mechanic (and great mechanics over all) and it nails the theme. Now the difficulty is something relevant (mostly because it depend heavily in the number of players), for example i find the HON quests to random and broken, NOT HARD, its like rolling a dice with 2 aces, how can you find this fun ???

 

A heavy combat solo deck has better winning chance against all 3 HON quest than Passage Through Mirkwood, does that makes it a harder quest? Don't think so ... ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

 

I love the way the game evolves lately (Black Riders, SOE, VOI) so i have high expectations for the next POD :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

QFT!

Love the POD quests, and difficulty is always relative.

I'm having high hopes for the Old Forest POD. Loved the chapter in the book, loved it in vanilla LotRO.

I would assume that Massing and Laketown set the precedent that PoD would be hard.

EDIT: Sorry, I'd didn't read your other post, we agree then that PoD are supposed to do their job of being hard. (Basing off previous ones)

I am also on the train of seeing SOE as  a very thematic and beautiful quest. Not as hard as the other GenCon PoD quests though.

 

The thing is that with its mechanics, it's relatively easy to ramp up the difficulty. For instance, changing the need of 4 tokens for each Night card (maybe 1 less) so you can reach Midnight in less than 7 turns.

 

Or you can make these Night cards more meaningful by giving Encounter Cards some permanent power-ups (like Dusk or Midnight making all Treacheries gain surge/doomed X, or boosting enemies stats). 

 

You can also do that with more Encounter Cards, not a lot of them use the Dusk or Midnight keyword (like Shadow Host Captain).

The point many people are missing with pods are theme. Every pod quest has a strict themde, distinct from any other quest. 

MaO is the only quest in the game to contain easterlings. Battle for Lake town has uniqie mechanic of burning and ton of lcations utilizing it. Stone of Erech is one of the two undead infested quests, and the only of all to contain this sort of environment and enemies. No other encounter card set from any currently existing releases would be able to provide base for those quests, like it does for regular APs. That's why those quests are PoDs, not because they need to be extremely difficult.

Maybe, in one saga expansion about the Return of the King, when Aragorn and fellowship want to claim the undead army.

 

PD: i love SoE, one of my favourite quest (in 4 players really really hard -and funny, 'and crazy'-) :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I just like challenge. I find the quests have a secret to them and it's fun finding it out, but once you do it's pretty much shelved. For instance, in BOG if I kill número on first turn it's easy quest. For morgal vale I use beorn and slaughter the two bosses each in the first two turns and just direct damage the boss a few times and it's done.

The really amazing quests are the ones that you can lose consistently even with great deck. Where you need to think through every card in your deck and every decision you make. Like laketown, siege, Massing when it first came out etc. these quest are fun to keep playing and don't force you to dumb down your deck to make it fun.

Stone of erch does not fit this mold. It's a **** easy quest. I beat it first time without serious deck building effort.

I just want them to make the quests harder. It's a shame to do this we now need to buy a quest and then wait for a nightmare pack at a ridiculolous cost to enjoy the quest.

Agree. Why is stone so expensive??? It's not worth it. Now I am going to wait for these instead of giving my money to FFG to make sure it's not a total crap job effort by them.

That's cool, bro, but do you realize not all the peoples think and feel the same way? So calling a quest "bad" just because it doesn't fits your taste is sort of selfish and ignorant. Just to be clear, this statement is not directly to you, but to all SoE haters out there.

I don't think it's selfish and ignorant. I am saying for me it's a bad quest and I listed reasons why. If other players like to play lesser decks that are more thematic then that's great for them. Just like a movie critic who dislikes a movie isn't being selfish - I am just giving my opinion that I think is not an isolated one.

You quoted this phrase "Yes doesn matter how you look on it SOE is a bad quest and im pretty sure sells nymber pretty few....." and agreed with it. There is no "for me", there is "no matter how you look on it", which implies all people who like this quest are wrong.
