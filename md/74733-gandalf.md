 May I play six Gandalfs if three are from the Core Set and three from the Hobbit? 'Cause they have same name although being different cards…

 No, you can only have 3 cards with the same title, by official rules.

 

Gandalf from Core and Hobbit share the same title, so you can only have 3 cards in one deck.

 

See page 27 of the core rules:

"A tournament deck must contain a minimum of 50 cards. Additionally, no more than three copies of any card, by title, can be included in a player’s deck."

 :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png] OK thanks. That's annoying. It would have made great possibilities.

But nothing prevents you from using 1/2 Gandalf (Core) and 2/1 Gandalf (Hobbit)….
