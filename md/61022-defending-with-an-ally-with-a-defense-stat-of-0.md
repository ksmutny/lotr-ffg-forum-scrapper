Hey all. I'm fairly certain I know the answer, but I'm just hoping for some outside input on a question that's been troubling me. Say I'm attacked by an enemy, and utilize a character such as West Road Traveler to defend, who has a defense stat of 0. Is the act of declaring her a defender considered defending, despite no damage reduction occuring? Or is the attack considered undefended? I would think the act would count as defending, but I'm not sure and can't seem to find any rulings on it. There have been a few shadow cards where the outcome of my game may have been different with an undefended attack as opposed to a defended one. Thanks!

Even if the defense stat is 0 it counts as a defended attack.  For instance, the next best use for a Snowbourne Scout after it enters play is to block an attack and die for the cause!

Awesome, that's what I figured, just wanted to be sure. There's only been a handful of times where the shadow card would have made it a win/lose situation based off of that, but it gnaws at me not knowing if I'm playing by the rules, lol. Thanks for the answer!

I prefer to send him on a Ride to Ruin. Either way, he exists only to sacrifice himself. Poor guy.

 He has been particularly useful for my Spirit/Leadership decks (play with another who is typically either Lore or Lore/Tactics) while attempting Carrock. We often get bogged down with locations in that particular quest, so he helps there, and then can be eaten by trolls.

Seems like it might be useful to make a note of all good sacrificial lambs in this manner (Wandering Took being another example).
