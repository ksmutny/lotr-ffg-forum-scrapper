So Sacked! says that the hero cannot "collect" resources... I know the hero cannot collect resources during the Resource phase, but wasn't sure if some card affects could "Add" to the heroes resource pool for instance ZIgil Miner's ability?? Thanks.

I'd say it's possible, although it thematically makes no sense that a sacked hero is receiving stuff by other members of his fellowship. "Collect" means that the hero is actively gathering resources, while "add" means that he is provided with resources. That's why "Parting Gifts" should also work, and Bifur could use his ability (which is also passive) to get some extra resources.

 

Now I have that picture of a Zigil Miner in mind, who happily drops his gold next to the sacked hero - and walks away singing and whistling into the sunset, while the hero desperately tries to get rid of his gag to curse the Miner.

Here are what the rules say about the resource phase

"Each player simultaneously adds 1 resource token to
each of his heroes’ resource pools. A resource pool is
a collection of resource tokens stored near a hero card.
These tokens belong to that hero’s pool, and can be
used to pay for cards that belong to that hero’s sphere
of influence. Each hero has 1 resource pool.
After collecting resources, each player draws 1 card
from his player deck and adds it to his hand."

 

I don't see anything in the rules that suggests that "adding" resources and "collecting" resources are mechanical terms that differentiate between resources gained during Phase 1 and resources gained via card effects.  So, I would say that the miner can't add resources to someone who has been "Sacked!"

 

edit, the FAQ makes it clear that my position is correct

"(1.25) Collecting Resources
Collecting resources refers to both collecting resources
during the resource phase and gaining resources
through other card effects. An effect that prevents a
hero from collecting resources prevents both methods
of acquiring new resources."

Cool, thanks. I still wonder why they use the term "collect" when they apparently mean something different.

i dont know about that, collect means 'gain' to me, though i guess where you come from in the world it can come across differently

They translated "collect" with "sammeln" in the German card text which (for me) means that you collect something actively. If you look at dict.leo.org there are about 20 possible translations for "collect". Some of the other translations fit with what you're saying, in the sense of gathering or accumulating resources.

I think there was a lot of linguistic slippage in the core set, and, to a lesser extent, throughout Mirkwood.  The designers didn't sit down and define a lexicon of game terms, and used language inconsistently in card design (a problem that only gets magnified in translation).  The use of 'add' and 'collect' to mean the same thing is an example of the lack of linguistic precision.  I love the game, but trying to parse card wording closely can get you in trouble.
