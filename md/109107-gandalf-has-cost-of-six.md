I just noticed that in here lotr homepage has that picture of Gandalf that has cost of six instead of five. Is it somekind of errata card what i have, because my Gandalf´s cost is only five?

I believe when the game was first about to come out Gandalf was spoiled and was going to cost 6, or perhaps an original draft of him with a cost of 6 was leaked somewhere. But no he definitely costs 5, he was just going to cost 6 until they changed it to 5 (before release of the core).

he originally was 6, before the release fo the first core and was adjusted down during playtesting.
