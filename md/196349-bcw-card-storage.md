Hi All,

 

Is the 800 count box too big to hold two cycles worth of sleeved encounter cards? As in Mirkwood and Khazad Dum cycles? As my collection grows I was going to use the original box for player cards, tokens, etc. and then break out expansions by twos.

 

Thanks!

If you know that you'll grow your LOTR LCG game, than the most storage space you can get for your cards, the better.

Yeah, I looked at the mega sized boxes but they would be crazy heavy and I didn't want to carry EVERYTHING all the time.

 

I will probably just try the 800 count box and fill the back end with foam if there is too much space left.

800 count might work. For some perspective. I have one entire cycle (Deluxe + 6 APs) and one Gencon quest sleeved in FFG sleeves fitting into a 550 count box with some room to spare (enough for another AP, but that's it). I use an 660 count box for the first 3 LotR Saga boxes plus 2 POD quests (Old Forest and Barrowdowns) with a little less room to spare. 800 count might work for 2 full cycles. If you're including Nightmare as well, maybe not.

Thanks for the info. I will give the 800 count a shot.

 

Nightmare is a long ways off for me, haha.
