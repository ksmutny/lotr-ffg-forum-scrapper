When instructed to "put an enemy into play" must you trigger any When Revealed effects? Also, what about "add to the staging area"?

You only trigger "when revealed"-effects, when the card is revealed in some way. Either by staging, as normal, or if another effect uses the phrase "reveal". Otherwise you do not resolve "when revealed"-effects.

Only when the card us revealed from the encounter deck.
