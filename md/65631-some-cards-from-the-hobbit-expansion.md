Hello all,

just wanted to share some new cards from the Over Hill and Under Hill expansion, revealed in the new magazine of Edge (French editor of this game). You can see them here [http://www.edgeent.com/v2_fr/edge_public/pdf_utilities/Magazine_Edge/EDGE_MAGAZINE_2012_Spring_FR_low.pdf] (page 9).

- Gandalf : same stats as the old one. Does not exhaust to quest. Forced : discard at the end of the turn or +2 threat.

- Gollum (50). 2 threat, 2 attack, 3 defense, 5 hit points. (…)

- Hobbit land. West Lands. 1 threat, (… at least 1 progress token on Hobbit land, the) -first player draws ?- (1 card) .

- Goblin caves. 3 threat. +1 threat to Goblins while Goblin caves is the active location.

- Sting (treasure). Bilbo Baggins only. +1 willpower, +1 attack, +1 defense. A special effect, probably : "When Bilbo Baggins is exhausted to defend, discard the first card of the encounter deck and inflict to the attacking enemy damages equal to the threat value of that card".

- One quest card (something Moutain). Adds one Stone Giant + 1 card / player to the staging area.

Cheers,

Jokin

oooooh juicy……..thanks for that

Thanks so much for sharing.

I really like what they did with Gandalf, I was much afraid he'd be a Hero this time. The original one is perfectly thematic but this is again very interesting, and a nice alternative.

Dard is Sting, of course.

And I don't want to be too clever about it but I think this Gandalf is made for a Spirit deck. After a while I began to include the original Gandalf only in a deck with Leadership (and Sneak Attack). But this one just needs Spirit to keep the threat low enough, I feel. And of course, you can run both in a deck - sweet.

The art on those cards looks great. Thanks for posting.

Thanks alot for the link! Btw, You can select and copy the hidden text on the location and other partly hidden cards. It is a bit shredded, but I guess it should be something like this:

Réponse : quand au moins 1 marqueur de premier joueur pioche 1 carte.
Ombre : le joueur en défense doit mettre la première carte de la pile de défausse de rencontre sur le deck de rencontre.

Sadly I can't speak any French, so it's up to you to translate that ;-)

The new gandalf looks very interesting. At first I thought he'd be overpowered, but then I remembered what +4 threat in RTM mean and that with this Gandalf, you have +3 in total, and Elfhelm won't help… So he'll again assist players only for a limited time, but now more than a single phase (Sneak Attack) or single turn (core-set Gandalf).

still with lore aragorn its not as big a problem…..of course that obviously means field him…..but perhaps gandalf will be twinned with some new threat reducing cards

## 11 [lleimmoen on June 7, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65631-some-cards-from-the-hobbit-expansion/?do=findComment&comment=641480)

Yeah, I think the Gollum card says something along the lines when you fail to answer the riddle, Gollum attacks Bilbo directly. And when you defend with Sting, you discard the top card of the encounter deck and if it is an enemy, then… here my French fails me but it can be along the lines that you hit the attacking enemy with a number of damage equal to the threat of the card? Probably not.

By the way, the new Gandalf also combos much better with Word of Command, I feel, especially as he doesn't exhaust to commit to the quest so it is not as unlikely to have him ready at the end of the round.

When Loragorn first came out I didn't get him, but then I forced myself to use him in a deck with a Leadership hero.  :o [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_ohmy.png]  He's my favorite hero now.

Which leadership hero do you use with him?

i use him with frodo and glorfindel for a flight to the ford theme deck with splash of leadership and rivendell minstrel to get the song cards

i alternatively use him with the twins for another themed deck

ive had considerable success with both

I use him with Théodred, I used to run a secrecy deck as they advertised but I added Eleanor to get a get-go access to Spirit. It works much better like that and the threat is not that high either (27). Of course this is only one way of doing it but I find Leadership quite worth it for the Stone but more importantly the Sword, and Théodred helps get those resources early.

I've had good success with what sounds like a similar deck, but with Strider + Theodred + Beravor. As you say, Theodred's extra resources are key. The aim is to put Sword and then Steward [and Stone as well in the perfect scenario] onto Strider second turn, and the odds of drawing into this (with Beravor) are actually pretty decent.

Very interesting stuff. The Gandalf is really cool.

I wonder if they will let us run 3x of each Gandalf or say only 3x total? It's a different card but same exact card name it seems. It's an interesting question as this is the first player deck card to have the same exact name as another.

Not that 3x of each Gandalf would be ideal in many decks but curious nonetheless.

The rules (p27) are, I think, clear on this: "no more than three copies of any card, by title, can be included in a player's deck." So you are limited to a total of 3 Gandalfs (Gandalves?) in any mix from the two different versions.

Oh cool. You are right, it actually does say "by title". The people on the last page confused me.

That's probably good.

There was no mentioning of otherwise on the previous (if that's what you call last) page.

But it is indeed interesting that you can have three copies of Gandalf but you can have a mix of the two versions. Strider actually calls for that mix as he's good to combo with Leadership and thus the original Gandalf can use Sneak Attack, and he is good in threat reduction in case of the Hobbit version.

Yeah, your comment on the last page about running both is what I meant. I read it as if you were running both 3x but looking back I see what you meant.

 

Not sure how often I'll mix Gandalfs, as they both have kind of specific uses. Original Gandalf is great to bounce down for his abilities but then doesn't stay around. New Gandalf is great for questing and then keeping out if you can deal with threat. I probably won't often mix because it's hard enough to find a Gandalf when you absolutely need him right now as it is, so having less than 3x copies of the one your deck needs could be bad.

But still, interesting options to consider.

## 24 [lleimmoen on June 7, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65631-some-cards-from-the-hobbit-expansion/?do=findComment&comment=641675)

Yes, that seems right. A card should have a purpose and having less than three copies reduces the chances of using it at the right moment.

I still think the original Gandalf is a great card, thematically and in terms of its function. But as I said I saw the trend of needing it less and less in my games. in the beginning of the existence of the game we always felt having Sneak Attack and Gandalf was the best thing that could happen in the game. Of course it is still a great combo indeed (and ever will) but I would often exclude Gandalf in a deck that was either not running Leadership or wasn't overflowing in resources. Now this Gandalf bring an entire new possibility. It is a truly exceptional ally if you can manage your threat well enough (which I feel may be very hard and nigh impossible without Spirit unless other spheres get their boost in threat reduction). Having an ally who can constantly quest for 4 and fight, is superb though beyond questioning.

 There was an earlier post that this Gandalf would work better with Word of Command. I can see that combo working, but it's easy to overlook that the original Gandalf also works nicely with Word of Command. If you don't sneak attack him, then after questing or combat, he readies at the beginning of the refresh phase. There's an action window in the refresh phase before Gandalf leaves play "at the end of the round," during which you can exhaust Gandalf to play Word of Command. That helps to make Word of Command more playable if you're not running Radagast.

Wow, I wouldn't think the game (or you in this case) would surprise me so much after so long of playing it. That is what you get when you don't study the rulebook hard enough. Thanks!

Forgive me, as I don't speak a single word of French.  But I am lazy enough to use Google Translate, so here is the text from that linked magazine using Google to translate:

 

LIVE THE DREAM
The three new scenarios in The Hobbit: For Mountains and Underground capture the excitement and emotions of the novel. Bilbo, Thorin and their company must avoid a trio of powerful trolls, shelter from storms and thundering giants, surviving an ambush goblins, fighting a pack of Wargs and a strange face creature known as Gollum in a riddle contest far below the surface. Each of the three scenarios in The Hobbit: For Mountains and Underground brings excitement and challenge. These scenarios should be played as much as experienced as they draw you into the incredible story this journey with a beginning, middle and end. In addition, scenarios can be combined to form a campaign that will allow you to relive the events depicted in the first half of the novel. And with the release later this year, a second box which will take events of the second half of The Hobbit, you can trace the whole of this fantastic journey. Meanwhile, players gain the benefits of capacity Unique Bilbo. Appearing in The Hobbit: For Mountains and Underground as a hero of the new sphere of influence: Baggins, Bilbo will join the adventure under the control of the first player. Which means that the first player can have up to four heroes, but the main actor of this extension is not a hero like other. As in the novel, the audacity and the spirit of Bilbo may save you from the worst situations. The scenarios contain innovative mechanical balance the combined efforts of the players with the central role of Bilbo. This one can not gain resources through card effects players, but each scenario offers ways to spend those that will accumulated. That Bilbo uses its resources to release the Dwarves bags of Trolls, he leads his companions through the ambushes Goblin, or uses his mind to solve puzzles, the use of its resources can have a major impact: the Players will have to choose wisely each expense. Rendezvous in a preview of next EdgeEnt.com for more information on resource use of Bilbo.

TREASURES  The Hobbit: By Underground Mountains and renews the game The Lord of Rings, the Card Game in many ways. In addition to Bilbo Baggins and scenarios that closely follow the events of the first half of the novel, this extension gives us the first treasures! The treasures are new maps that represent players quelquesuns objects of the rarest and most expensive that your characters can find as they sail to Middle-earth. But players can not add these valuable items directly to their decks. To use a treasure card, players must first locate the in the scenario. It is only then that they "unlock" the possibility of using these cards later in the famous scenarios. Treasures increase the replayability of exciting scenarios Hobbit by rewarding players beyond mere victory over each quest. In addition, they establish a continuity in the countryside that unifies all the scenarios of the extension. We will disclose more information on these exciting new maps in another preview on our site.
 

WHAT IS AN EXTENSION OF SAGA?
While an extension of the classic Lord of the Rings, the game Cards creates new original adventures in Middle-earth, Extension of this saga gives us the chance to follow the exciting J.R.R. story imagined by Tolkien. The characters, enemies and scenarios Hobbit, By Mountains and Underground are directly learned from the first half of the novel and the second extension Saga, forthcoming normally during 2012, will transport players until the conclusion of the book. Scenarios Hobbit, Par Monts et Underground can be played by independently of each other or be joined to form a campaign offering greater immersion in the game world

Also, if you download that magazine as a PDF file, you can hilight all the text fields of the cards and export them. This allows you to see what the "hidden" text on the cards is (such as the text on Gollum that is behind the top of Gandalf). Again here is a poorly translated version of the card texts that are on that screen (I have erased the copyright lines and tried to convert into the actual terms used in the game where it is obvious, otherwise I have left as it translated in Google):


GOLLUM. Enemy.
74 (card number in set, I believe)
2/21 (card number in box)
0 (threat)
2 (attack)
3 (defense)
5 (health)
Forced: when the first player responded to a “puzzle” (similar to a locate test perhaps?) without getting at least one “line card criteria announced” (some sort of counter or keyword on the encounter card??), Gollum attacks Bilbo Baggins (do not assign him to shadow map this attack).
"If precious asks, and it does not respond, we eat, my precious. "- Gollum, The Hobbit


THE MOUNTAIN PASS (Quest card)
Beyond the cold and Misty Mountains – (name of the encounter, I assume!)
27 (card number in set)
Once revealed: Search the encounter deck for a Giant Stone (perhaps they mean “Stone Giant”??) and place it in the staging area. Then shuffle the encounter deck. Reveal a card from the encounter deck for each player and place it in (the staging area?)


STING (TREASURE)
Artifact. Object. Weapon.
20 (card number in set)
Attach to Bilbo Baggins. Restricted.
Bilbo Baggins gets +1 willpower, attack, and defense
Response: when Bilbo Baggins is inclined to defend, discard the top card of the encounter deck. (Inflcit) the enemy attacking damage equal to the value of threat of the card discarded.
"Thou shalt be called Sting. "- Bilbo The Hobbit

GOBLIN CAVES. Location. Cave.
3 threat
13/18 (card number in box)
If Goblin Caves are the active location, enemies get +1 threat.
Shadow: The defending player increases his threat level X, where X is the number of enemies engaged in combat with him.

COUNTRY OF HOBBITS (Probably more like “Hobbit Country/Land”)
Location. Western Land.
38 (card number in set)
1 threat
17/29 (card number in box)
Response: when at least one progress token is placed on the HOBBIT COUNTRY (or whatever it’s called), the first player draws a card.
Shadow: The defending player must put the first card of the encounter deck discard pile in the staging area.


GANDALF (Ally, Istari)
10 (card number in set)
5 - resource cost
4 - willpower
4 - attack
4 - defense
4 - health
Gandalf is not inclined to engage in one search. (He does not exhaust to commit to a Quest)
Forced: At the end of the refresh phase, discard Gandalf. You can increase your threat by 2 to cancel this effect.
"I am Gandalf, and Gandalf is me! "
- The Hobbit

I'm curious how many card in total we'll be getting. I need to know how many sleeve packs to get for this. Anyone know? Do you think it might be a similar count to KD expansion?

I bet it is considerably bigger than KD. They wouldn't have FIVE heroes in there for nothing, or would they?

Given that each of the three quests seems to be in a totally different kind of landscape (woods, misty mountains, underground caverns) i wonder if we'll have totally standalone encounter decks for each quest… so we wont be using the same cards each time. i hope so, that will be nice

im thinking that because this set isn't likely to be used as the base for the next adventure pack cycle, they could do 60 cards (or something like that) for the encounter decks (which is more than we got for the standalone set for massing at osgiliath), 3x5 for the heroes, and 3xwhatever for the player cards -- and that will roughly be the size of the first box-set. so we won't have to reuse cards in each quest.

but even if they cut it down to the size of the khazad-dum box-set, they still wont need to re-use many of the cards in each quest.

I've just realised I've been thinking it was five heroes + new Bilbo across both Saga Expansions, but it's five heroes in the first one alone! This makes me even more excited about this game now!

Sadly we will be getting only dwarf heroes (exluding Frodo because he is limited to the saga set). It wouldn't make much sense for them to give us anything besides Dwarfs. However I hope we get to see some good hobbit event and attachment cards from this SE.

 Any chance of seeing Gwaihir, Thranduril, Beorn or Bard will be deferred until the second box I think.  Perhaps Elrond, but I see him as a high powered ally.

I wonder if Fili and Kili will have complimentary powers ala Elledan and Elrohir?

I would understand Thranduil and Bard being thematically better in the second box but surely not Gwaihir, and Beorn can go either way. I think the box 2 will begin with Mirkwood, not with Wargs and the Eagles rescue. Mirkwood is such a long part of the story that you gotta have the entire quest devoted to it. Then you have got Smaug, and finally the Battle of Five Armies.

i use him with frodo and glorfindel for a flight to the ford theme deck with splash of leadership and rivendell minstrel to get the song cards

i alternatively use him with the twins for another themed deck

ive had considerable success with both



 

That is my favorite deck as well.  I also have song of heroes and the glorfindel leadership cards + songs…if all goes well, I make some decent money while equipping awesome gear.
