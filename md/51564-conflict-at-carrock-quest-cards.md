Is there supposed to be only quest cards in Conflict at Carrock?  I only got 2 in my box.

 yup, there are only two. and an upcoming adventure pack quest will only have 1.

Man, I wish they had said that on the insert. I was really thrown by the fact that the second Quest Card didn't have any "The Players have won the game" text on it. With only two copies of the expansion available at the store when I bought mine, I was worried I wouldn't be able to replace the card I thought I was missing.

It would be awesome if they would do an end of block card errata inclusion - where at the end of each adventure cycle, they include re-printed and corrected cards from those picked up in the expansions / core set.

Hell I would even pay for a POD set of corrected cards.

Food for thought.

 PoD for errataed cards is an awesome idea.   I know that they are re-releasing some of the older chapter packs of the Game of Thrones cards, updated with errata and whatnot.  Either an end-of-cycle printing or whenever they get around to reprinting the cycle, this is an awesome idea.

 Updated cards in triplicate? I'd buy.

I doubt we will ever see PoD player cards.  Because of their lower quality, you can't mix PoD cards with anything printed using the normal printing process.  End of cycle would be to quick a turn around to have erratta in place.  We would probably have to wait for reprints a few years down the road, if we ever get them.
