# [Staging card draw question](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/90446-staging-card-draw-question/)

In a two player game if one player has been eliminated in the previous round how many cards do you draw in the staging step? Is it still two cards as it has been essentially a two player game or does it revert to one card now that there is only one player?

It's still two cards -- it was addressed in the FAQ:

 

Q: If a player is eliminated during the staging step of
the quest phase, before all encounter cards are revealed,
does the elimination reduce the number of cards that
should be revealed for staging?
A: The base number of cards to be revealed is
determined at the beginning of the staging step, and
does not change if a player is eliminated during
staging.

Since one player is eliminated in the previous round, at the start of the staging step of this quest phase, there is only one player remaining, so only one encounter card is drawn.

Sorry yes, I read the question wrong.  It would be 1 card.  It would only be 2 cards if the player was eliminated during the quest phase.

If a player was eliminated after staging has begun actually.

Could be an important distinction, in case a quest card instructs you to do something, before the staging step has begun.

Thanks for all the feedback. So in the round following the demise of one of the players, the other player (one player left in the game) draws only one card if I see correctly?
