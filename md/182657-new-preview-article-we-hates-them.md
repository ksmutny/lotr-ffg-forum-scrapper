I wish there was at least a single player card. However, they promise more to come. And this one to come soon. How relative time can get...

As I said elsewhere, Sméagol/Gollum is one (or two) of my favourite characters. Still, didn't we see them in the original preview already?

My favorite line from the article was this:

 

"The Land of Shadow [https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2015/4/30/the-land-of-shadow/] Saga Expansion for The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game [https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-card-game/] is now on its way to retailers"

 

...although I don't think its arrival in stores is quite as imminent as that made it sound :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Upcoming page says still in concept stage. Maybe it will be updated soon?

The article now says, "Of course, exhausting the One Ring can bring hazards of its own, as players will discover when The Land of Shadow arrives at retailers…"  In the first preview article we were told it would arrive in the third quarter.  We'll see.  (We were also supposed to get two other adventure packs in the second quarter.)

 

I'm interested in the line on Gollum which says, "Immune to non-O player card effects."  Currently there are no O player card effects which would affect Gollum so it sounds like we'll be getting one.

Frodo from The Road Darkens also has an effect which targets an enemy.

"its new ranger heroes"

will all the heroes in this pack be rangers? it sure sounds that way!

What is going on in the art for Smeagols secret way? Can't see anything but rock but a blue glow?

Another article with no player spoilers and just one or two new encounter cards (with a whole handful that have already been spoiled as well as art without card info). Seems like this is going to be a pretty regular thing.... boo!  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

Art for Haunted Mere with the mountains in the background and mix of colours used for the marsh and its water is just beautiful!

I've already got myself too excited about the potential for that AND Mount Gram AP.  Would be so psyched

So we have to be getting a Faramir hero.  The other one is probably going to be Damrod or Anborn, right?

## 16 [Gizlivadi on July 17, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/182657-new-preview-article-we-hates-them/?do=findComment&comment=1694795)

Yep, that would be my guess.

 

Also, even though I enjoy player card spoilers more than anything else, I didn't expect a new preview this month, and I certainly prefer to have more frequent preview articles, even if they just spoil a few cards.

Keeping my fingers crossed for Damrod since he doesnt really have a place in any ranger archetype with that sphere and cost

I was about to edit my post to say the same. Ally Anborn is great with traps!

Yes, if they are frequent, then it is good to start without a player card spoiler. I know some (few but still) players are more excited about the quest than the player cards in the previews but I always find the spoilt encounters to be only take out of the context. Then there is the mechanics, though.

 

So yeah, I missed the part that the new heroes be all rangers. And by all, I think it is safe to assume there will be just two. Still, two is okay. One is Faramir, and I am sure hoping he will be Leadership. The other I am guessing Damrod and Lore (the Spirit ally being rather underwhelming, except the great art).

 

ps: Now I see you guys above are saying similar things. Do not think I am just copying you, haha.
