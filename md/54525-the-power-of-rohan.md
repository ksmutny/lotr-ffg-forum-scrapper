I'm a little conflicted about how strong Rohan is in the current metagame.  A properly built Rohan deck can dominate the questing phase and effectively keep its threat low to avoid being engaged with enemies and exploiting Dunhere's attack ability.  I don't really have a problem with it, but it is arguably the most powerful deck construction currently available.

I bring this up because with the preview for the first Dwarrowdelf AP, The Redhorn Gate, FFG mentions that the new "secrecy" keyword rewards decks built around threat reduction (Rohan).  On top of that, the first AP looks daunting once you reach Caradhras with the -1 willpower reduction, meaning that you'll need strong questing abilities/willpower in order to explore it (Rohan again). 

Anyone else a little concerned that FFG seems to be pumping Rohan/threat reduction, even in upcoming cycles?  Shouldn't they be doing more to help the less privileged factions?

Rohan is powerful, but for a price.  You'll notice most Rohan characters are in play for only one round or so because their best benefits require you to discard them.  That is fine if you can keep enemies from engaging you, but when they do, a Rohan deck is usually lacking on the ally front.  Threat reduction does help with that, but currently you can only have a maximum of 6 threat reducing cards in you deck of at least 50 cards.  That's a little more than 1 threat reducing card for every 8 cards.  Those aren't bad odds, but they're not fantastic either.

 secondly, we don't know what secrecy means exactly and what impact it will have... 

thirdly: I think that hobbits and dwarfs are going to see a strong buffer in the upcoming packs and the deluxe pack!!!

I mean, ffg won't ruin their own game by simply avoiding ALL fights, an essential part of LotR, just by reducing the threat! all the fun is in the fighting, in my opinion :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png])) helping with ranged, sentinel, effects, combat actions, shadow cards....

Now, I think you're right, but the "metagame" will change... for dwarfs now and maybe later for elves.... and I can't wait to see the rise of GONDOR (in 2 years, whatever... :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png])

While we dont know what "secrecy" does, we do know that it has a correlation with threat reduction and keeping your threat low.  Rohan doesn't have great combat allies, but if you're running an Eowyn/Theodred/Dunhere Rohan deck, you have access to Leadership attachments and some of their allies as well that help in combat (Faramir,Brok,Northern Tracker, etc are all decent allies).

Maybe they'll spread threat reduction to other spheres besies spirit as well? In my opinion a very large part of the books revolved around the heroes not getting noticed by the baddies, so I think the important role of threat reduction is thematically fitting.

I would love to see everyone get some sort of minor threat reduction. I mean, technically anyone can do it now because Gandalf is neutral, but spirit does it best. I just hope they don't add too much threat reduction, because that would make the game too easy.

Yer at the moment it is more a spirit "issue" than a Rohan issue  in regards to threat reduction, isn't it?

Eowyn's willpower in combination with G-Greeting is really what makes the deck so strong in regards to threat management.

Although i have found that other than in specific circumstances, like JDtA, where keeping threat low until you are ready to engage the Hill Troll is vital, having a high threat isn't really that much of a problem - my leadership/tatics deck doesn't normally fail from high threat but from location lock - obviously Eowyn helps avoid that though too!

 Yeah, I am of the opinion that Rohan is the most powerful right now.
