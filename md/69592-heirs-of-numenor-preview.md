thanks for the link. Perhaps we'll see this before the un(officially)announced Hobbit Saga II

and now they took it down…boo!

in the meantime, here's what i remember:

-they showed a tactics event: ready a defending gondor character to give +1DEF
-the cycle is called against the shadow
-and the enemy spoiled was battering ram. its shadow effect does damage to something something called "the approach;"  i think its stats were 2 7 3 5
-10 encounter decks
- comes out Q4 2012

Yeah Dain, it looks like you're right.

As far as what you posted, that all seems correct, the battering ram also had a nasty forced (I think it was forced), if active location is a battleground that location receives 3 damage. So that's a new mechanic. Over at BGG there's a pic of 3 cards fanned out (non of which you've mentioned): [ ] indicate covered text and hypotheses on my part.:

Defender of Rahhas (Rammas?)     Tactics (2 cost)

0 1 4 1 Gondor. Warrior

 

Ithilien Tracker     Lore (2? cost)

? ? ? ? Gondor. Ranger.

[Action: Exhau]st Ithilien Ranger to lower the […] the enemy added to the staging area [at the en]d of the phase

 

Blood of Numenor     Spirit (0 cost)

Condition (Gondor or Dunedain hero)

[Action: Discard] 1 resource from attached hero's [pool? …] to give attached hero +1 Defense for […t]o its resource pool until the end […(l]imit once per phase).

 Hi everyone! Finally decided to post something cause I just saw the preview and came by the new Heirs of Numenor mini site, here it is: javascript:void(0);/*1345586466037*/ [http://fantasyflightgames.com/edge_npm.asp?eidm=157&epmi=s]

By the way, it looks utterly awesome! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 Neat, they also mentioned the cycle coming right after it, Against the Shadow. Seems like they'll be rolling out the expansions pretty fast.

## 17 [Narsil0420 on August 21, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69592-heirs-of-numenor-preview/?do=findComment&comment=678799)

This was well worth the wait in terms of news! So freaking stoked. It seems like it's really going to be battle focused and different from the previous encounters. I also love the idea of searching for Brigands and the art on that treachery card with the rainy town. 4 defense ally! And Magali doing Ithilien Ranger art!?! FOR GONDOR!!!!

 Battering Ram deals damage to an active location, and the article mentions using attributes other than willpower to quest - could it be that Tactics will not only become playable, but actually GOOD during this cycle? I hope so, as it currently feels like they're pretty much dead cards.

I love the idea of taking part in epic battles, so if the quests turn the willpower requirement on its head, then this cycle could be a lot of fun.

## 23 [Cunir on August 22, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69592-heirs-of-numenor-preview/?do=findComment&comment=679186)

I was really hoping for some kind of Shire cycle before this was announced but i've changed my mind now. This looks pretty cool. I like the way they are moving towards big huge battles and battlegrounds, and things like that, instead of just having a piddly little group of us wandering through the forest trying to save an eagle

 

that "battering ram" card is a bit wierd. it's supposed to be an enemy… and yet it does damage to the active location. But the locations are kind of like enemies too, because we need to get rid of them. So does that mean we will be able to put friendly locations into play, that give us benefits? And these enemies come along and destroy them?

 

Doesn't Laketown take damage as well, in that new GenCon quest? Does anyone know how that works?

## 24 [lleimmoen on August 22, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69592-heirs-of-numenor-preview/?do=findComment&comment=679194)

There have been some "good locations" already and I really expect this will be the theme, after all most of these locations should be within the realm of Gondor (at least for some quests) and you might have to try and keep them safe. What hp will the locations have is the other question…

As for the mechanics, I really hope this is going to be a shift towards making Tactics much more important, especially in solo play.

## 25 [richsabre on August 22, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69592-heirs-of-numenor-preview/?do=findComment&comment=679203)

agreed- the spoiled cards so far seem VERY much focused on protecting and defense which is great

laketown is an objective that can take 50 damage, more than that, and you lose.

I don't mean to SPOIL, but does anyone else think that the ranger at the top of the "About" section is Faramir?
