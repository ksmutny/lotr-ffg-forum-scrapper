Galadriel allows Ents (who come itno play exhausted) to quest on the turn they enter play, right? In the rulebook it says you have to exhaust characters in order to commit them to the quest, but if you don´t have to exhaust them to commit it doesn´t matter wether they´re exhausted or not, right?

You'd think so right... but no. A random ruling has come down recently that says to quest tapping is not a COST but a pre-requisite. So while you can quest with out tapping, you still need to be in the ready position to tap to be able to quest.

This rule is pretty lame imo, as it removes a lot of cool options and gimps some cards and most importantly, there is NOTHING in the rules that say this.

Check out Trollo's Thread on that Spirit Attachment that allows questing with out tapping (Valinor) to get caught up on this insanity!

Thanks, that is indeed disappointing.

 

Btw, wow, quite the threat you linked there. And I thought Nightmare Journey Down the Anduin had a brutal troll-battle. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

It does, a prerequisite to questing with a character is that it must be able to exhaust even if it does not need to thanks to Light of Valinor or Galadriel.

 

Its similar to Vigilance from Magic. The creature does not tap (exhaust) to attack but cannot attack if it is already tapped from some other effect.

Think of being exhausted as being used up/tired from the actions they have already taken, (hence exhausted! :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] )

therefore even if they don't exhaust to quest they need to not already be exhausted/used up to participate.

It's not a recent ruling.

 

Here [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/70818-question-about-does-not-exhaust-to-commit/?hl=valinor]'s the same question posed in 2012.

What I mean is it recently came up as there is nothing in the rules or FAQ that says this, so it is impossible for new players to infer this rule form reading the official material. This is why it comes up every year or so. There is just nothing in print that supports this (or contradicts it). IMO, the rules as written imply it as a cost that can be ignored and as with all other card games I treat only teh faq and rule book as official.

> Specifically, p.14 of the core rules discusses ready and exhausted states. Exhausted characters "cannot partake in any action that requires exhaustion." The general action of committing characters requires exhaustion, even if card text allows a specific character to commit without exhausting.
> 
> The same principle holds for attacking and defending.

Couldn't be clearer

well starhawk77's notes kind of reinforce his views on the point.. lets look at the full manual text.. this should give you a better idea of what the controversy is about... 

 

An exhausted card cannot exhaust again 
(and therefore cannot partake in any action that 
requires exhaustion) until it has been readied once 
more
 
This is the part that other post is talking about... but the manual also talks of the Golden Rule 
 
If the game text of a card contradicts the text of this 
rulebook, the text on the card takes precedence
 
The so... the bit you should be looking at is highlighted... The card text who's golden rule overrides the manual removes the need to exhaust. So the action no longer requires exhaustion. This is where the confusion lies.. not in the obvious text. As written exhausting is not defined as a prerequisite, but as a cost... and a cost can be removed. Like say paying doomed 1 to play a 1 cost card with Grima.

 

This is teh confusion... though your right it is answered.. and it will be answered again. The quest comes out about once or twice a year though with this new hero, I bet it will come up a few times.

Please stop quarreling about this, it´s utterly pointless to tell each other the same things you told each other in the last thread. Just agree to disagree and move on.
