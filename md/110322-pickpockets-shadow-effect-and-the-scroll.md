In the Peril in Pelagrir Scenario, does it discard the scroll from an attached hero, or since its an objective it is not "my attachment" and it stays?

The player gains control of objective attachments that are attached to his characters (unless stated otherwise).

Â 

The Pickpocket's shadow effect will return the scroll to the staging area per the passive text on the scroll itself ("if unattached return to staging area").
