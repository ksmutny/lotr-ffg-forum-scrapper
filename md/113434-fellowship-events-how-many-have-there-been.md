So I see that all the previous Fellowship Event scenarios that are in the Print On Demand section were old Gen-Con scenarios. Is the Barrow Downs one coming in October the first that hasn't been? Or are were there more Fellowship Event scenarios that aren't now Print On Demand?

Â 

Also how long after Gen-Con does the convention scenario become available for the rest of us?

I'm curious as well. I see there is an alt-art Aragorn promo in the upcoming October event. What other promotional cards have been released, if any?

To my knowledge, there have not been any promotional-type scenarios or cards for LOTR LCG released outside of GenCon. I'm also curious about whether the Barrow Downs scenario and Aragorn card will be available from Print on Demand after October. I'll be disappointed if the only way to obtain these cards is to attend the event, since I can't guarantee my schedule will allow me to take part.

I'm sure down the track it'll be print on demand. I sure hope so at least!
