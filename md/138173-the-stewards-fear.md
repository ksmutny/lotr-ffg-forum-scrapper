I have recently begun to buy LOTR expansions, and I noticed that the adventure pack The Steward's Fear has been mentioned as an amazing pack and a must-buy. Unfortunately, none of the online stores have it in stock, and all have it at back order. Will FFG restock this adventure pack soon? I can't find an ETA so I'm not so sure.

It is being reprinted... Still on the boat but expected on Q1 2015.

Thanks. I think April is the last month of Q1 so hopefully it will arrive soon.

This is one of my favorite scenarios of all time. Tons of replay value and it scales nicely. The player cards are great too. You will love it!

Thanks! I've read the description of this adventure pack and it makes me want to buy it asap. I just hope FFG won't push back the re-release date so I can try it out soon.
