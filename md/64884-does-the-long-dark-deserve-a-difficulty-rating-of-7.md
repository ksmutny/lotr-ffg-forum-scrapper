# [Does The Long Dark deserve a difficulty rating of 7?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/64884-does-the-long-dark-deserve-a-difficulty-rating-of-7/)

Finally played through "The Long Dark" last night in a two player game. I was playing my Dwarf Lore deck (Using Gloin, Bifur and Benavor) and my brother was playing my tactic deck (Brand, Legolas and Thalin). We got off to a shaky start because he failed the first locate test because my brother didn't want to discard his cards from his hand so we had to raise our threats by 7. However after that we kept the staging area clean and never had any of the lost effects triggered.

For being "The Long Dark", I thought it was weird that it was only two quest cards and being a 7 didn't make much sense. We fought some pretty nasty enemies but with Thalin (Which is a must include) we managered to take them out during the round they engaged us. Anyone else have a easy time with this quest?

Yeah ive played it three times in the last few days, once solo and twice with 2 players (each different people). The only time i lost was solo, simply because i was trying a new eagle multiplayer deck i used during the first co-op win and simply didnt have the questing ability i needed fast enough. Still it never really gave us much trouble. when i want a little challenge i usually spin through carrock solo lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif]

At first I would agree with you.  My first attempt, just to test my decks, was 2 player using only Dwarves (Heroes and Allies) plus Gandalf.   We couldn't believe how quickly we won.  Only lasted 5 turns and we passed the only 'Test' on the 2nd attempt.  Not believing it could be so easy, we played again with the same decks and hopefully better knowledge of what to expect.  Result:-  Arses whooped!!!!  Fought on bravely for some time but just lost too many Heroes.  Thoroughly enjoyed it but now know that it can and will turn nasty very quickly.

It seems to depend on 'when' you get the 'nasties'.  One at a time can normaly be dealt with, but get 2 close together and watch out!  Exausting all characters with enemies about hurts like hell!  Having to discard an ally each that you kept back as 'canon fodder' can easily lose a Hero or two!  Failing a 'Test' with lots of 'Lost' effects in play normally spells the end.  Yes, it is all about 'timeing', which you can't control much, except with cards like 'Rumour from the Earth'.  Overall I would have set it at level 5 as it is just 2 long hauls - Dain boosts Willpower - with only 1 really tough enemy, the Cave Troll - Dain boosts Attack.  Nothing really new and similar to the Khazad Dum basics.  The Watcher was my favourite with all those tentacles.  Cheers!

Oh, kidding? Massing at Osgiliath is like hundred times harder than Road to Rivendell, I find that to be surely the easiest quest from both cycles. Have only  done about 10 games of it which may not be enough but was never once threatened - and I certainly cannot say that about any other quest - even Hills of Emyn Muil gave me a struggle once or twice. Really the only way to lose this one is to that Sleeping Sentry Shadow card but if you keep the threat low - which is very easy here, you should not fight until you're prepared.

But this again shows people have different approach and style which fit different quests. I for instance had quite some struggle with the Carrock solo until I learned to wait, but then still, you can get Sacked and crippled big time and the Adder or Hill Troll can also hurt.

i found road to rivendell easy too - seems the only thing that could go wrong is sleeping sentry and if you have cancellation cards….

also watcher is fairly easy….its easier than what i thought to just snare the watcher and then open the doors at leisure

Nope. Went 2-8 against both, honestly thought would go 0-10 vs MaO. RtR if you didn't draw your Shadow effect canceller in time, game lost. Or if you had your canceller but got nicked of your resources by a Treachery. Lost RtR even when I got Beravor + UC combo going off turn 1.

Here are two fairly normal games for me in RtR:

"Road to Rivendell

Leadership/Tactics and Spirit/Lore decks

Not much to tell. Double mulligan doesn't bode well, then Crebain sits in the staging area, meaning Undisturbed Bones hits Arwen for one. Pathless Country comes up as Shadow Effect, killing Arwen for a turn 1 loss. Heroes are defeated.

Road to Rivendell

Tactics/Spirit and Dwarf decks

Seven threat in the staging area after setup makes things look tough, but parties manage to quest successfully, even clearing a location and travelling to another. Then, three Enemies engaged, Sleeping Sentry as Shadow Effect kills Arwen. Heroes are defeated."

Carrock has never given me any trouble, in seven plays lost just one hero to Sacked + Roasted and even he came right back thanks to Landy.

Try Road to Rivendell with low threat beginning, actually try going under 27 at the start so that none of the baddies jumps at you in ambush. If you have got Háma already, try him with Dúnhere and Éowyn, for instance, you should have fun.

## 11 [lleimmoen on May 27, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/64884-does-the-long-dark-deserve-a-difficulty-rating-of-7/?do=findComment&comment=636530)

I had to try Road to Rivendell after this little discussion. This is a short report…

I take the three Rohan heroes I had mentioned. I get Follow by Night for set up, does nothing. Quest with Arwen and Éowyn, get Knees of the Mountain, discard useless Arwen (player card), place 5 progress. Travel to the location. Play Ancient Mathom and Horse-breaker next round. Staging is Undisturbed Bouns, kill the Horse-breaker, place 2 pt on the location, 4 on quest (total 9), nothing in the staging area. Play the Riddermark's Finest and Gondorian Spearman, quest with the two girls only again, staging is Bitter Wind, I lose some resources (four or five in total I think) and place seven more resources (after playing Elrond's Counsel), the threat is back on 26. Play Escort from Edoras but only quest with the girls again, staging is Goblin Taskmaster, I kill him with Hail of Stones (exhausting Horses, Escort, Spearman and Dúnhere), part 1 done, Goblin Gate enters play. Play another Horses and Ancient Mathom, quest with the two girls and 1 horses, staging is Followed by Night again, Goblin Gate finished, 3 cards drawn, 3 pt on the quest. Play West Road Traveller, quest with three girls now, staging is Orc Ambush, Taskmaster enters play from the discard pile, part 2 finished. I engage the Taskmaster, Spearman defends, leaves, Háma and Dúnhere finish the job, Háma exhanges Hail of Stone for another copy of Arwen. Staging area is again clean. Play another Traveller, quest with the four girls, staging is Sleeping Sentry which I cancel with A Test of Will. Had I not had the Will, I would have lost the two Travellers but were still half-way done, this way I only had 3pt left. Played nothing, staging was Orc Raiders, game finished.

I am not sure if this is lucky way for the things to go, I think the deck is very much suited for such a quest, even though I have not onced used Dúnhere's ability and only once Háma's. And the two have only attacked once. I haven't drawn Feint but having had drawn two copies of Ancient Mathom was quite lucky I guess, especially as there were exactly two locations in the entire game.

Overall, I think this is a very good example of a quest which is much easier solo than 4 players for instance. Also, it is a good example of a quest where Éowyn still seems super strong whilst Dáin could get killed early. Even if I could not use the player card Arwen, having the objective made playing Elrond's Counsel much easier.

Hope this helps, Dam, in your future experience with the quest…

RtR = secrecy scenario

-> Bilbo + Théodred

I don't cherry-build for each quest. My decks are pretty much what they have been since I first put them together. Naturally weaker CS cards and AP cards have been dropped as better cards have come out and even a few heroes have been swapped here and there, but the basic structure (and idea behind them) is the same as it was.

I have five decks (from 2 Core Sets), which, when paired up once with each other decks equals 10 plays per quest. And key here is that no hero can be duplicated so that any two decks can be picked up and played.

Lore/Leadership (Denethor, Glorfindel, Gloin)

Leadership/Tactics (Aragorn, Theodred, Legolas)

Tactics/Spirit (Boromi, Brand, Dwalin)

Spirit/Lore (Eowyn, Eleanor, Beravor, on 7th level I had Dunhere instead of Eleanor)

Dwarf (Dain, Gimli, Bifur)

Wins against RtR were with Tactics/Spirit + Spirit/Lore (Beravor + UC spam from turn 1) and Lore/Leadership + Spirit/Lore (Beravor + BB + 2x UC).

Also, after I've played a quest those 10 times, whether I go 0-10, 5-5 or 10-0 is immaterial as far as playing the quest again goes, haven't bothered replaying any of the quest so far (bar Passage for a few test runs). And doubtful I'll bother revisiting any of the completed quests either. New quests are coming out with a steady rate.

I don't build decks with quests in mind either. I have a few decks like you do and take one (or more) that I feel most suited for the particular one. I don't even change a card, thus I still kept Arwen in the deck although there was not chance to use it in play.

I see you've got a really interesting approach to the game, with that 10 game limit. As for the decks you listed, I would suggest placing Dunhere with a Tactics hero, he seems to work so much better as such, being able to Unseenly Quick Strike enemies in the staging area.

Yes, secrecy or low threat in general. Bilbo Theodred seem a bit vulnerable but I haven't tried them. How do you deal with the enemies once you pass the threat barrier? Or do you manage to keep it down enough even without Spirit in the line-up?

I have manage five more games against the Road today, they were usually pretty quick, around 10 minutes. I did lose one in the final part of the quest just as I was going over the line the Orc Ambush got me without A Test of Will. It really seams even much worse (in general) than Sleeping Sentry. When I was looking back to that lost game I noticed I wasn't trying hard enough to finish as quickly as possible, and it has just cost me. I wouldn't choose my favourite Denethor plus Hobbits to this quest as they are pretty slow and it can be ominous here.

Bilbo + Dúnedain Mark/Protector of Lórien + Bruning Brand + Fast Hitch is enough to deal with two or even three enemies. I rarely had more than two who can engage my fellowship. Thanks to Arwen one is able to play Faramir and the expensive lore allies very early, so WP is not a problem.

Dunhere was originally in the Tactics/Spirit deck (which back with just CS was Gimli, Thalin, Dunhere), but he was always the odd man out, plus the deck couldn't quest to save its life, usually dragged down the other deck with it as well. Swapped him and Eowyn around to give T/S deck some questing, but then Dunhere was all but useless along with Beravor and Eleanor.

Thing is, three of the decks have a starting threat of 29, one 30 and ladies weigh in at 26. Which means Dunhere at best can get maybe one or two attacks into the staging area before Enemies start auto-engaging. Mostly it was just Hummerhorns and original Sniper that he's been killing, 7th Level had so many "add Goblin X to staging area" that there were Enemies added during combat, meaning they didn't engage this turn, so with a single +1 attack, Dunhere was useful in keeping the staging area clear. Of the tougher Enemies that do lurk in the staging area (engagement cost 35 or 40+), he needs buffing quite a bit to kill them in two turns, I prefer to choose to engage, throw a fodder at it and then gangbang. In a solo environment where you can manage your threat + low starting threat, I'm sure Dunhere kicks ass, but when he is left to attack Enemies that are already engaged, he is mediocre at best, nor does he really have any other attributes worth including him, he can't defend, crappy at questing.

And attack? I doubted not that you can manage the defences but who does the killing in the deck? Mirkwood Runner I suppose? As we have talked elsewhere, he seems very good for such a quest.

I have been trying Dúnhere from the start. Have always found him special, even though at some games - and especially early with the limited card pool - he seemed not very useful. From the long experience, I came to a conclusion that he needs another Spirit hero - to provide for an relatively early Galadhrim's Greeting, and a Tactics hero - one is enough to play the important events or the occasional Spearman (or even some Eagles).

I actually think he has gained quite a bit of importance with some devastating shadow effects like the Sleeping Sentry - which is relatively mild in its treachery form.

That said I do agree, he might cause some headache trying to figure out the proper deck, and he might require deckbuilding around him, which is probably something many people aren't willing to do with their decks being fixed at a different strategy.

I still didn get TLD cose dont have time go to my shop (pack is there alredy).

First i was happy about difficult 7 but……. Many players wrote on forums this one is more easy then RTR. I dont understand FFG again. We geting more and more powerful player cards (Like Asfaloth) but encounter deck same time going to be more and more weak. Sound at least strange……..

Agreed. The last few packs have seen some really powerful player cards, but the encounter decks are not being raised to the same level.

for once i tend to agree….since the start i have always had the opinion that the quests were about right, with a couple of exceptions(playing solo that is), but there have been some absolute killer player cards recently (sword the was broken for instance) that i believe are far more powerful than anything we saw in mirkwood

## 25 [leptokurt on May 29, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/64884-does-the-long-dark-deserve-a-difficulty-rating-of-7/?do=findComment&comment=637520)

The difficulty of TLD are mainly the location tests. Only less than a fourth of the cards of the encounter deck has the "pass" text, so in most cases a player has to discard at least half his hand to get through.

SPOILERS:

 

 

There are two cards that can really destroy your fellowship. One is a "when revealed" treachery that deals 2 damage to every single character (from both players!) if the starting player fails the location test. The other one is a location (threat 3/4, depending on the adventure card), that requires a location test to put progress tokens on it. The first can be cancelled with Eleanor or Test of WIll, the second by the new (and otherwise almost useless) Hobbit event card (exhaust a Hobbit character to shuffle a revealed location back into the encounter deck and take a new card instead)

That's why I think TLD is harder than RTR, but less difficult than any other KD and Dwarrowdwelf scenario so far. I usually manage to pass one location test, but if there is a second, I get in trouble. But as I finish this quest in 6-7 rounds, this problem occurs only rarely.

## 26 [lleimmoen on May 29, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/64884-does-the-long-dark-deserve-a-difficulty-rating-of-7/?do=findComment&comment=637526)

Yes, exactly. I have played this for two days in a row and found the two cards plus Vast and Intricate the biggest threat perhaps. There is hardly anything one can do against the location - passing the test is hard. In a similar fashion, unless you cancel the treachery, you might lose. That said, I am yet to lose a game out of eight played (all 2-player, solo may be harder here, not sure).

However, I still think quests can kick one's butt, often when you adjust your deck - or pick one - to a certain quest, you might actually get weaker for another.

And as for the player cards, true, there are some great ones coming up but I still think if there be a poll for top 10, core set may get more than a half.

well id be the first to admit that when first testing a new deck againt passage through mirkwood….i quite often get my arse kicked

and yes, just a few months back a poll was taken on here, and i think almost all of the highest voted cards were core ie steward UC POL etc

I find this easier solo'ing than in multiplayer.
Still, this will never be a difficulty 7.

there has been some killer cards.. but this isn't one of them… 3 to cast, and has the same effect as a 1 cost song… and while the other effects powerful you have to run Aragorn to get that effect… (measurably worse than say CStone, as the non Aragorn ability for "any" deck is relevant. There has been some crazy powerful cards in darowdelf.. but yeah.. that aint one of them.

you cant be serious? each character with  +1 willpower isnt powerful?….and so what if you have to play aragorn- i think thats a given, i mean no ones seriously going to pay 3 for it to be a song card….aragorn is a powerful hero, and this card in his hands is a powerful card

Actually some of us…..most of us to be honest play this game is 1 year already. So many of us have already quite good skill level as a players and deck builders.

So this mean even without new powerful player cards many players can manage the current quests without big problems. So i how you feel if the new quests is more easy then previous one??? NO challenge make game boring…………

I still think we need a better system which  provide you options to change the difficult of the quest by players. Yes i can make a house rules but then Quest log is useless cose if everyone play by his rules how we can compare the scores? We can have in he rues of the quest some additional rules for advanced players like expert lever or Tournaments level rules and normal rules for beginners. So then every kind of player will be happy and every quest can be more hard or more easy depend of the players current need.

how would those 'advanced rules' go then? advanced=drawing extra card in staging step? or would it be more complex?

i think instead they should concentrate their efforts on getting it right the first time

yes most easy solution is additional draw in staging but……with quest difficult more then 5 you lose quickly. Add. draw can work only with quests diffficult  4 or less. No there should be proper system developed by designers. I just trying to say this will be better for the game.

But they must be doing something right perhaps since you've been gaming for over a year now - and actually bashing the difficulty from almost the day 1.

An easy wat to make things difficult on you is to make a thematic deck for a theme that hasn't been well developed, like Silvan. Take a Lore Tactics (for instance) mostly Silvan deck around the quests and see your winning percentage then. Do not change the deck between the quests and I bet you're not going to win a half of the existing quests.

thats a good point - you dont have to field your best deck each time, on emyn muil for instance i can build a deck that wins every time (just a spirit deck) however when i change it about it isnt so easy anymore….want to make it really hard? try it with tactics..now thats a challenge..and while this doesnt solve the problem them not getting any harder it may help you get more out of them

you cant be serious? each character with  +1 willpower isnt powerful?….and so what if you have to play aragorn- i think thats a given, i mean no ones seriously going to pay 3 for it to be a song card….aragorn is a powerful hero, and this card in his hands is a powerful card



The effect is powerful IF you are running Aragorn. If not, then the card is rubbish. I do not have much of a problem with near out of balance cards if they are deck specific. In fact, there is a long history in card games of very powerful cards that are designed to only work in a handful of decks and nowhere else. This is cool and in fact can lead to interesting decks as the designers can encourage deck builders to make strange decks. The fact that this works with what until Loreagorn was a practically unplayable hero makes this card a curiosity to encourage deck building.. not a stupid power card like say Awern that will be in 100% of all spirit decks for the rest of time.

Just wanted to get back to the OP. I played tonight with 4 players. I was hoping that the quest would somehow be much harder with more people. But alas it was still fairly easy. Oh well. It's not that I mind having an easier quest, I just wish it was more accurately labeled.

I feel this one can only get hard in the very beginning. If you get the Mine-shaft or Twisting Passage as a set up (for solo) and then again or the Spider which you cannot cancel. Once you fall behind early in this one, there's probably no going back. Having said that I really haven't lost this once. And I remember losing Passage through Mirkwood many times solo (and not with a pre-constructed deck but my own built).

I think part of the problem is accommodating the difficulty needs of different "tiers" of players within the same quests. The quests are trying to cater for the play level of relatively new players with smallish card pools, and at the same time for seasoned players with honed decks and access to all the cards.

One potential design solution to this problem, building on Glaurung's idea of "advanced rules", would be to build "difficulty levels" into each quest. I think this could be accomplished quite easily, by keeping the encounter deck the same but printing two sets of the quest cards, one for "standard" difficulty and one for "advanced". The "advanced" quests would (say) place additional cards in staging at the start (one of the key points that makes a quest difficult or easy in my view), require significantly more questing points at each stage, and/or place additional restrictions on the players (like the Dol Guldur "only one ally" clause, the RTM extra threat gain, etc).

I think this could work because:

- everyone understands and would be comfortable with the concept of "difficulty levels"

- it could be done by printing only a small number of additional/duplicate cards (the quest cards)

- it would keep the story and overall design of each quest the same

- it would give double the challenge and play experience to newer players - tackle the basic level and then move up to advanced when this has been mastered

On the other hand, it looks like part of the problem is that the designers/playtesters are not capable of properly assessing the difficulty of quests. To put it bluntly, if the playtesters assessed TLD as being on the same level as Dol Guldur or Return to Mirkwood, then those playtesters are not very good. Or it may be that the designers are not listening to what the playtesters tell them. Either way, the outcome seems to be that FFG are trying to meet the need for more challenging quests, but are not succeeding in doing so at the moment.

Agreed. I think that even the apparently tough openings (eg double Twisting Passage) are still quite easy to get round. My play experience with TLD so far is:

- win quite easily and repeatedly with my existing solo deck

- win very easily and repeatedly two player

- take both "halves" of the two player pair of decks, which aren't even designed to run independently, and contain a number of dead, useless and seriously weakened cards, and still win very easily. This included a victory against Twisting Passage in set up and another one revealed turn one.

Conclusion: I agree with (it seems) pretty much everyone - this quest is trivially easy and very disappointing.

I got this disappointed already long time ago………. But unfortunelly there is no other Lotr card game at the moment now so i keep play this one.

let look on the last Cycle:

Hunt for Gollum - is ok. Not goof noy bad just ok.

Conflict in the Carrock- Really easy quest  in my opinion not worse difficult 7

Rhosgobel- yes this is good one. Really hard and interesting.

Hills of Emyn Muil- this quest is the big shame for Designers. Really disasters

Dead Marches- interesting idea but in the end very easy and boring quest

Return to Mirkwood- This one is cool. Really ok.

Massing In Osgiliath- the best quest ever. Why we dont have other quests on the same level?

KD- is not really difficult but anyway increase difficult of the game and bring new mechanic. Good job.

Red horn Gate- Very good quest. interesting mechanic and what ls really important get more difficult on the second and last quest step.

In my opinion good Example of difficult level and interesting idea.

Road to Rivendel- Very big dissapointed. Really easy and stupid. Ambush sound cool as a mechanic but in play is quite boring and no dangerous at all.

Watcher in the Water- IS ok. Good quest. Cannot say is amazing but is not bad too.OK

Long Dark- Just get it. Sound not to diffiucult and sure not worse difficult level 7.

So this is my vision of the game.

Instead to make great quests and make the system where the players can increase or discrease difficult level they create very cool (in theory) game but really most of the quest is not really good. Lazy designers or FFG leaders is dont care? Anyway there is no other Lotr card game so people will play anyway right?

Cose we love this world and we like to touch it again.  But in My opinion ME CCG was much much better and Decipher game also.

In my rating:1 ME CCG, Second Decipher game and last place for Lotr FFG.  

So what we need to make this game bettter? Better quest more difficult and more fun, Better balanced cards and really much more hard work of designers. I know many players dont agree with me but this is my position. And i stay on this position whole year and i still there. Things going better now but still not enough to say This is great game!!! Sorry is not and im the first who suffer from it……..

there isnt more quests like osgilliath - because most people find that ridiculously hard!! your opinion is most certainly a minority in this game

i seriously cannot see what skills or experience you are applying to be so far ahead of everyone else on this forum and finding the quest so much easier than anyone else- after all many people must have similar or more experience than you, so whats your secrect?

im not being sarcastic here, im genuinely interested in what methods you are applying to get such easy results with all the quests as you have literally been finding this too easy since day one

I have to say I too am disapointed with some of the quests. But it is not mostly the difficulty aspect, for instance I really dislike Rhosgobel, it can be quite hard but boring (for me) and very specific, Lore of Imladris being the card though it is mostly bordering useless in other quests. Maybe that is not actually bad but as I dislike deckbuilding specifically for quests, I am not a fan of this. I also dislike a quest like this because the games tend to be very similar, rush through it, find an Athelas or two (or not even if you have a copy or two of Lore of Imladris) and be done with it. You don't get to use the combos you've got in your deck, you don't build on the strategies you'd prepared, you don't boost the heroes, you just want to be done with it as quickly as possible because each new round makes the table red. I know race against time makes sense it is just not my cup of tea in this case.

Given the disapointment I have had with some of the quests I am usually looking forward to player cards when a new adventure pack hits the stores (or is being previewed). Were it not for the player cards, I wouldn't have bought some of the quests surely.

i admit that the first things i buy a pack for are often the player cards…….but i suppose thats all part of how the game works

Seems to me that, from a solo player's point of view, there aren't many quests that will both challenge you without being impossible to win. Journey Down The Anduin comes to mind here. I'm hard pressed to find another quest that fulfills that purpose quite so well. Most of what we have seems to be fairly easy stuff like Emyn Muil, Hunt for Gollum, even The Long Dark, which so far has been pretty easy for me, as well. Or you get Dol Guldur, Return to Mirkwood or Massing At Osgiliath, which are extremely difficult. There seems to be little middle ground.

The problem, I think stems from the amount of difficult encounter cards in a deck. In the tough quests, you get tough card after tough card. In the easier ones, you have one or two cards that can really hurt and that's it. Sometimes, like in Gollum, cards have to form a combo to be of any real threat. I just think that scenarios could be created where encounter cards can be more balanced towards a certain amount of toughness overall without them being all brutal or mostly harmless.

thats a good point titan…..expanding on that - certain encounter sets are brutal, some arent- the wilderness ones with the trolls in is brutal as it has nasty locations/ treachery/ enemies

Agreed - though Wilderlands also features in some of the easy quests such as Carrock and Dead Marshes, so I don't think this is the whole story.

I feel that one of the key factors that distinguishes the hard quests from the easy ones is this: the staging cards you are confronted with at set up. The "norm" is one staging card per player. Those quests that give you more cards than this (or specifically dangerous cards) are generally the tough ones. Those that give you less are often the easy ones.

Examples: Anduin (Hill Troll), Massing (multiple enemies who will attack you), Dol Guldur (three cards in staging plus other crippling restrictions)

Examples of easier quests: Carrock and Rhosgobel confront you with just one innocuous location in set up. This is also another reason why TLD is weak for more than one player, as it gives (no of players)-1 staging cards.

1) We need more enemies set up in the staging area. It doesn't have to be a deadly one like Hill Troll, but something that prevents a player from questing like hell. Like those goblins in KD that will kill you, if they're undefended.

2) One thing I liked about Redhorn is that some of the nasty cards are only shuffled into the encounter deck suring the second stage. Why not creating an adventure that includes different encounter sets for each stage (=level)? First stage includes rather easy cards, second one cards more deadly and so on.

3) I love cards that have a printed value of X, in which X is the number of allies.

I agree with all three of these points. Also, I like cards such as Cave Torch which present the player with tricky choices, and also provide mechanisms which add additional cards to the staging area.

Indeed Cave Torch is a very interesting addition. However, I feel it is one of the primary reasons why the Long Dark is not that difficult. The probability that you get an easy wat out of trouble is there plus even if you get another enemy, it is usually a much better option. Sometimes with Legolas I was actually wishing for an enemy to show up.

Yes, I think the Torch works better (in terms of providing difficulty and challenge) in Into the Pit where there are a greater number of problems to deal with.

yes that i always try to say wnen i  mean more Difficult and interesting. Cose most of the quest very monotony. If there is no many cards with surge once when you clear the staging area finish game get boring cose 90% you win the game. And if is happen on the first quest card is really stupid feeling. Cose you still whole adventure to play with feeling nothing can destroy you. IS is not Boring??? But when quest is build up like RHG or MIO or KD quests ( lot of surge cards and with second and third quest card is going to be more dangerous) is really interesting to play cose you cannot predict what happen and every time game can change same like pvp against reall opponent.

Aslo i sure we need some encounter cards who should to react on current status of felowship and make more damage if felowship more strong( lot of allies Atachments and so on). Also i really like KD encounter cards idea if encounter card effect do nothing ( in the case like: remove all progress tokens but there no any) cards get surge. Why they stop it for DW?

I noticed this very quickly. What has happened to me is that I"ve used the Torch to get rid of a location that has come up in set up. This is a large encounter deck which means that the likelihood of enemies coming up due to the Torch's effect is minimized. Of the 60 cards, 21 are enemies. That's roughly a 33% chance that one will come up due to the effect. If this happens, you will have nothing in the staging area on the first turn, prior to the encounter deck revealing a card. Compare this to The Watcher having two cards in staging and then revealing a third one, and you can see the difference.

Just tried the following experiment against TLD: play with three heroes (Glorfindel, Eowyn, Core Aragorn), and a deck of fifty blank cards (i.e. I only used the cards to discard for Eowyn and for locate tests - did not play any attachments, events or allies). Still won two times out of six. You really shouldn't be able to do this.

The scenario lacks a third stage. Therefore my suggestion:

 

Add a third adventure card with the text

"Far away you can see  a first glimpse of the Eastern Gate. Just as you think that this was probably just a bit too easy, you hear a mighty roar in front of you.

Search your deck for a Cave Troll and bring him - engaged with the starting player - into the game. The players cannot win as long as a Cave Troll is in play."

Progress: 1

Good idea. Sometimes i think: what designers think when they create quests like this? maybe need to play 3 or 4 players to really get what they create in this quest. 

Also i dont understand idea of Goblin sneak!? : Discard top card, if treachery move to the next player?! For what ??? What is the point of that??

Actually when i play this adventure solo  i remove this stupid armor, Mountain roof and change Stray goblin for Goblin spearman. Cose Stray goblin And mountain Roof make sense only in 3 + players game.

I tried my variation and (of course gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]) I still won the game. Ok, I am running a lore/tactics deck right now (Glorfindel, Denethor and Legolas) which won every single game against TLD so far, but with results between 80 and 110 only. Tne tactics part of my deck made it rather easy to defat the troll: Legolas + Vassall of the Windlord + Glorfindel gave me 9 ATT alone. I didn't even need to use Feint or Rivendell Blade. Would be interested how a spirit based deck fares against a boss enemy like Cave Troll.

 

Back to the discussion: 1) I think that fighting enemies should be the key part of this game. 2) Making progress in a quest should not be limited to the sheer amount of WP, but linked with other factors. A good example is Abandoned Tools in FfM, which you had to have to make any progress at all during the last stage. Dwalin is another good example of how fighting your enemies (instead of avoiding them) can give you a benefit. 3) Carrock - this is not a very difficult scenario, but I as a player still feel satisfied when clearing the stage from all these trolls. Booored already opened another thread in which he complained about the fact that it's possible to win the game with all/most enemies still alive. And he was right to do so. What we need is more Carrock! 4) Enemies should have high threat values, like that Cave Spider in TLD, so that a player has a reason to fight them. Right now it is to easy to keep your threat low enough so that enemies won't engage you, while you can bring out more WP than there is (additional) threat in the staging area. Glaurung is completely right that once the staging area is empty it's not very difficult to keep it clean. The Nameless Fear was a very clever designed card to prevent that from happening. 5) As a side note: Am I the only one who thinks that Fast Hitch is overpowered and should have been made unique?

The scenario lacks a third stage. Therefore my suggestion:

 

Add a third adventure card with the text

"Far away you can see  a first glimpse of the Eastern Gate. Just as you think that this was probably just a bit too easy, you hear a mighty roar in front of you.

Search your deck for a Cave Troll and bring him - engaged with the starting player - into the game. The players cannot win as long as a Cave Troll is in play."

Progress: 1

 

 

Good idea. Sometimes i think: what designers think when they create quests like this? maybe need to play 3 or 4 players to really get what they create in this quest. 

Also i dont understand idea of Goblin sneak!? : Discard top card, if treachery move to the next player?! For what ??? What is the point of that??

Actually when i play this adventure solo  i remove this stupid armor, Mountain roof and change Stray goblin for Goblin spearman. Cose Stray goblin And mountain Roof make sense only in 3 + players game.

 

 

I tried my variation and (of course gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]) I still won the game.

Hmmm….. about Fast Hitch……. Card is cool, powerful sure. Too powerful? Maybe but…… I r think we already have a lot pf players cards in the game too powerful! 

And Fast Hitch is not top in this list in my opinion. You talking about Fast Hitch is to powerful? Must to be unique? Ok but what about Beravur ability : is worse once per turn errata…… U courage also why not unique?

Yes i think you right should be unique……..

As i say before:  situation can change the real tournament system with new rules and Restricted cards list. There is already a community playing this game more then 1 year. And we need optimal challenge we already past the beginners level right?

My main point if we get cool, powerful player cards give us really cool difficult quest and powerful encounter cards. Otherwise is boring.

Sure they could have made a different card (theme and name) to make it unique but with cards like Unexpected Courage or Fast Hitch it would go against all logic to make them unique because how could a knot or an emotion be so?

What they easily could have done was to limit Beravor's ability to one per round. Well, they still may if they use that errata, like with the Nazgul of Dol Guldur, for instance.

Now After new Glorifindel release talk about errata is pointless. People who create card like new Glor. will never do Errata on Beravur.

I really agree here. And to be honest, Beravor is not really even close to how powerful this new Glorf is.

I'm currently 8-0 against TLD, two more games tomorrow, but I've already relegated this quest to join Carrock as joke DL7. And this is with at best, mediocre decks (and that is probably more than a tad polite). Got only my second turn 3 win today as well.

Dwarven Forge in play after setup, not too bad. Things get better when Snowbourn Scout shows up, slapping a progress on it. Burning Low adds another 3 threat, but thanks to Cave Torch, it is cleared, although a Goblin Follower is discarded. Good thing though, since now it can be engaged at will, so Scout blocks it and dies, allowing Imrahil to ready and hack the Follower down with Legolas. Quested for 7, got 4 progress (Goblin Sneak also showed up), then Legolas's kill for a total of 6/13.

Turn two, Escort from Edoras joins the fray, as does Erestor, quest for quite a lot more, Abandoned Mine shows up, along with another Goblin Sneak. Cave Torch clears Mine, then Shadow of the Past used to put it to the top the Encounter deck, so only one card needed to pass the locate test for 2B. Legolas kills one of the Goblin Sneaks, 2/17 progress, empty staging area.

Turn three, Escort returns via Stand and Fight, Theodred gets Celebrian's Stone, parties quest. Goblin Follower (haha) revealed, engages, so no threat added, then The Mountains' Roots. Pathetic 2 threat in the staging area vs 17 willpower, didn't even need to use Eowyn or Protector of Lorien to boost questing to complete the stage.

I think the most I've spent on stage 2B is three turns, one-turned it quite a few times. Maybe, like in the second game today, where I got 14/17 progress on 2B the first turn there, if you get Vast and Intricate and fail the locate test, wiping out all your progress, it could buy the Encounter deck enough time to get you. Then again, in that second game, I got back to back Massing in the Deep during 2B and still breezed through.

For long time i didn play coop games cose my partner was away for a while. So now we start to play coop game again with my friend. We gather now every week once and play all day from morning to evening (2 players games). And if we play some really good decks sinergy good together there is almost no chance for us to lose any game. Doesn matter difficult level. We can win any quest with out any problem. And we get boring again. Thanks MIO this one is really cool!!!

This quest is so briliant is only 1 quest which keep interesting to gather cose we never know we lose or win until the end. I think if  MIO was not  there is no point to gather for us to play this game in coop mode.

there is another opition how to make game more difficult: each player can use each sphere only once. This also make game more hard and then you can play quests difficult 7. FFM and RTM. They are quite cool then!

And last cool think in my opinion Nightmare mode: RHG and RTR without Beravur, Will of the west. Really cool then!!!

But other quests is pointless to play to easy and to predictive game play. Really boring.

About TLD: it can be realy nasty for solo game. Can switch sometimes very fast and in 1 turn change light to dark. Its happen rare but when happen i like it.

Like ambush , Location test i good idea but quite low execution.

Finished 10-0, last game almost got me. After clearing stage 1 in two turns sorpresa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sorpresa.gif] (shocking mostly because Leadership/Tactics puts out massive 3 WP with Imra + Theo), failed the When Revealed on 2B despite burning most of my hand. Lightless Passage + Twisting Passage didn't make for a nice pair to see in the staging area, seven threat, was constantly needing Cave Torch for other locations so took a while to travel to LP, with 0-1 cards in hand for both parties, there was no way I was travelling to TP. Vast and Intricate wiped out my progress during 2B and threat hit high enough that on the last turn, couldn't even Cave Torch + Action on Zigil Mineshaft as the Dwarf deck would've been eliminated. Squeeked out a win in the end, Legolas really shining once again.

On a related note, Legolas had Steward of Gondor and even after paying for Beorn and Eagles of the Misty Mountains, ended up with 15 resources unspent, while Imrahil and Theodred had about 4 a piece as well.
