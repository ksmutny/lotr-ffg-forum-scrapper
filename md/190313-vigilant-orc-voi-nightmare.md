Howdy,

 

quick question about Voice of Isengard in Nightmare mode: I just got my copy and I see that the four Vigilant Orc card have on their back the "ring" and not "the eye of Sauron", just like they were to be put in the heroes decks.

 

This is misprinted, right?

 

Thanks for help

Not a misprint. If you read the rules insert vigilant orc is shuffled into the out of play deck (mechanic used in the quest to catch an orc) much like mugash and mugash's guards. =)

Ok, sorry, I was just sleeving before reading rules! Thanks buddy!
