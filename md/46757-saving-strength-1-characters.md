Hoping for a bit of clarification on the exact timing of things.

The encounter deck chucks out a card that deals 1 point of damage to every knelt character. As the Daughter of Nimrodel is knelt, she takes damage, and having only 1 hit point should be dead.

My question is, do I have the opportunity to pay a resource from Glorfindel's pool to heal her before she disappears (I'm thinking along the lines of AGoT LCG, where cards have a period in a moribund state, where you can take actions) or does she disappear too quickly for this.

Obviously the question applies to any other 1-hit-point character taking 1 point of damage in any other situation.

I'm afraid without a spirit card or Eleanor to cancel a "when revealed"-effect Nimrodel is dead. :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

On the last pages of the rulebook is a list when you can take actions and the encounter-card-phase is marked as red -> no player actions. Only responses work there.

No mate you can't.Glorfindel heals one point of damage on a character he doesn't prevent a wound on a character.You could only save an ally with one wound only if we had a response abilitie on a hero or on a event card which can prevent wounds.Glorfindel can't save heores or allys with only one wound.

 Only a Response can make you react to something.

An Action can be played only when an action window is open, and when no other Action (by another player or by the game) is resolving.

Actually, as I understand it, if the character only has 1 HP and is about to lose it, even an action window wouldn't help.  You can't heal the character before it takes the hit, and after it takes the hit it is dead.

Now, take another scenario: you have a character that has 2HP but has 1 damage token on it already.  The same Encounter card comes out during the Quest Phase.  If you *could* heal the 1 damage at this point you could save the character, but there is no action window so you can't.

Now the same character defends against a 2-attack enemy during the Combat phase, but the character has 2 armor so shouldn't get hurt.  Then the shadow card is revealed and it gives the enemy +1 attack.  Now the character *would* die, but these stages are green so you *can* play an action to remove the existing 1 damage token, then the character takes 1 damage and doesn't die.

I believe this is all correct, but others please feel free to correct me.

 You can play actions after the shadow card is revealed / resolved and before the combat damage is determined.

So in your example yes you can save your character. But if the Shadow card would have said "deal 1 damage to defending character", you wouldn't have been able to save him.

There is no 'kneeling' in this game. You must be confusing something.

kneel, bow, tap, exhaust etc. All the same mechanic, just a different name for different games.
