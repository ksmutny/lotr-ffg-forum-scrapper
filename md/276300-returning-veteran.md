Hello everyone, I am an old player from the days when this game first was released, about to get back into the game.

Firstly what have I missed? I last collected during the ring-maker cycle. I see several new cycles are out now.

Secondly having sold my collection I am looking for some of the rarer packs, especially the dwarrowdelf cycle which, apart from one or two packs, seems to be out of stock everywhere i look, including second hand. Does anyone know of anywhere stocking this cycle? I asked FFG about reprinting the cycle and they couldnt give me much info on it. Ive looked on the upcoming page and they are there awaiting reprint.

Ffg cycles their reprints for the game so what is in stock and out of stock rotates.  I think Dwarrowdelf tends to go out of stock more often because it has very good player cards. I would get what you are able to and eventually what is out of stock will come back around. There’s enough of a card pool now that missing some packs won’t hold you back too much.

angmar Awakens cycle, the Dreamchaser cycle, and the Harad cycle are all very good!

Welcome back to the game!

Well, the saga has finished and three new cycles are now out (Angmar Awakened, Dream Chaser, Haradrim) with a fourth on the way (the Wilds of Rhovanion deluxe was spoiled). We've also been introduced to Epic Multiplayer mode (up to twelve players) and are awaiting a new competetive/build your own quest format at Gen Con.

I can't help with finding the old packs, though. I'm looking for them too, and I can't find them anywhere.

Seeing as the entire Dwarrowdelf cycle (including Khazad-dum) is Awaiting Reprint my hopes are they'll get bumped up to At the Printer here within the next month.
