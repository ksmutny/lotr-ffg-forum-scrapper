Ok itâ€™s not that exciting. But Iâ€™ve been playing for about a year and have beaten every other quest (of the ones Iâ€™ve played) at some point, except for this one. This was about my ninth or tenth attempt of this quest and Thaurdir finally died.Â

Ninth or tenth? That isn't many tries at all! Congrats!

Took me a lot longer to do it, but maybe that's because I played progression style with the most recent errata (i.e., nerf of Love of Tales). Or maybe I just suck. ðŸ™‚

Well I did tech for it a fair bit by building a super-defender for the last few attempts - which was Beregond with Gondorian Shield, Armoured Destrier, Hauberk of Mail, Song of Wisdom, A Burning Brand, and Unexpected Courage. And even with that set up before going to stage 2, I still came close to losing (due to threat). I think this is by far the hardest quest Iâ€™ve played, without a doubt.Â
