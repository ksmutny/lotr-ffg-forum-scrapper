Hey guys, sorry for posting so much lately! I'll cool it after this :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

But we had to record an episode to discuss the Nin-in-Eilph! Hope you enjoy!

In this episode the WWPD Fellowship starts off with a quick AAR of their recent Middle Earth adventures and introduces a new resource that will hopefully help gamers meet up on OCTGN. The bulk of this episode is spent gushing over the player cards from the brand new AP: The Nin-in-Eilph aka The Swan Fleet.

Hi, 

 

Not sure if it's just me but both the links (the download link, and the embedded player) on the page you posted both play Episode 1 again?

Good work! I am really impressed with the quality of all Lord of the Rings LCG podcasts, both this, The Grey Company's and Cardboard of the Rings'.

Very flattered that you'd even lump us in with those other guys :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] We have fun doing it!
