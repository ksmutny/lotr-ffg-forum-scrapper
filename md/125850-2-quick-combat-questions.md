1. A squire (1hp) defends against an enemy with 3 attack. The enemy's shadow effect reads "deal 1 damage to all characters".  the squire dies immediately and before the attack right? Who defends the attack then? Is it undefended? Can a new defender be declared.

 

2. Same as above but after the shadow effect is revealed a player uses feint. Does the shadow effect resolve?

 

Cheers.

1. It's undefended.

 

2. You can't play Feint at this point. See FAQ p8:

"Q: When should Feint (CORE 34) be played?
A: This card should be played any time before 
resolving step 1 of the target enemy’s attack during the 
combat phase. (Once the act of resolving an enemy’s 
attack begins, it is too late to prevent it from attacking 
with Feint.)"

Oh boy. I've been playing feint wrong for almost a year.

 

Welp, time to have Beregond dust off his Gondorian Shield and give good ol' Cair Andros another try.

But wait! Can I use the wizard's voice after the shadow effect is revealed, or is it the same situation?

Same situation as feint.  Sorry!

 

Btw, that is a nasty shadow effect.  Which encounter card was that from?

The actual shadow effect was deal 1 damage to each ally in play. Pathless country card from road to rivendell which I was playing in nightmare mode. The enemy it was attached to had 5 attack and I play a leadership/tactics deck with Sam, Imrahil and Eomer with sneak attack and tome of atanator x3 for multiple Gandalf in-and-out action. It was working great until up to that point.

Played nightmare Road to Rivendell last night as a break after my 10+ losses against nightmare Shadow and Flame and lost Road to Rivendell as well due to:

ffg_orc-ambush-rtr.jpg [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/ffg_orc-ambush-rtr.jpg]

Returning 9 enemies to staging from the discard pile.... and I already had 3 engaged (two handed).

I got utterly clobbered.... this was after surviving Sleeping Sentry early on as well!

I ve only played NM once because I bought the pack just recently and was superlucky to control shadows with repeatable feigns. Sleeping sentry really is the most brutal card ever printed.

 

I got the same treachery you posted right after entering quest phase 2 so I only got 2 orcs back from the discard pile. Just brutal. I dont even remember coming across this card in regular RtR, which goes to show what an improvement NM is (and how well designed too).

 

However I have also enjoyed my time with NM a lot. It takes real strategy and carefulness to make it through. You both need to know the encounter deck's tricks and fine tune your deck, making you a better player. Ive already improved my deck by removing Saruman for 3 dunedain watchers and took less resource generation for some extra card draw. Hopefully I wont have to switch to Outlands/Gandalf hero to make it through.

 

NM RtR has my ideal "hard" difficulty. Here's another question, what other NM quests are at the same level? I like tough but not ram-your-head against-the-wall hard (I just end up frustrated and feeling dumb :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]). Im thinking about picking up NM PtM next.

I found the first two of the Khazad Dum Nightmare quests (into the pit and seventh level) are both of a similar difficulty level and so is The Redhorn Gate (except for Snow Giant.... brutal card...). The Long Dark and Watcher in the Water nightmare are slightly harder but not too crazy. Passage through Mirkwood is also about the same yep and Journey Down the Anduin is also not too crazy (except for Gladden Fields with 10 Threat).

 

Orc Ambush actually is in the normal encounter set for Return to Rivendell but every time I've every encountered it there has been an orc in the staging area or it has only revealed an orc or two from the discard pile. Nine was just ridiculous....

Returning to the subject are these options possible after losing your defender to a shadow card?
 

 * Sneak - Gandalf/Orc Slayer (to kill the attacker)
 * Quick Strike/Haldir
 * Pursuing shadows/Rain of Arrows/Goblin-Cleaver/Taking Initiative

I think you can, but don't know for sure. So therefore the question ....

There is an action window between revealing the shadow card and resolving the attack. Moreover, new attack, even ones made during the staging step, open the new sequence of the attack with their action window.

All 3 are good.

Different card than the OP, but Blocking Wargs from Into Ithilien is the shadow you're looking for.

Personally I NEVER want to see that card! ...though I do prefer it as a shadow card if does make an appearance
