# [The juicebox LOTR LCG Solo Player Tournament (#6) [January 8-14, 2012] [COMPLETED]](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58619-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-solo-player-tournament-6-january-8-14-2012-completed/)

Welcome & Introduction:

Welcome to my sixth Solo Player LOTR LCG Tournament. This week’s tournament takes us past the half way mark in a series of tournaments exploring the Shadows of Mirkwood cycle. The idea behind this tournament is that for one week (Sunday – Saturday), everyone is invited to participate in playing a particular quest with particular deck building requirements in a Solo Player Tournament. You are then invited to record and post your final score, the heroes you used, and any additional narrative that you’d like to add.

Note: this is not a place to post results from the past. The tournament has a one-week lifespan, and only games played and recorded throughout this week are valid. As the week unfolds, I will keep this first post updated with the Top Ten results. (Each participant can occupy a maximum of one Top Ten spot at a time, so you’re welcome to try and best your own result throughout the week.) See also, The juicebox LOTR LCG Top Ten Hall of Fame [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=582954].

Will you place in the Top Ten for the week? I hope you’ll participate and find out!

After the end of this week’s tournament, you are welcome to continue to post results to this thread if you continue to play this particular quest under these particular parameters. However, the Top Ten on this first post will not continue to be updated after the week is over, thus preserving (like a time capsule) the results from this week’s tournament. In the mean time, if you have ideas for a future tournament of the week, feel free to suggest them in the Ideas Thread [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=579104&efpag=0].

And now… on to this week’s Solo Player Tournament!

 Well, not sure how good this is, but here's the score from my first game today: damage 3; threat 20; victory points 20 (Amon law & hen; 2x highlands; outer ridge; shores of new hihoel; chieftain ufthak); 8 rds for an overall score of 83.  

## 3 [leptokurt on January 8, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58619-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-solo-player-tournament-6-january-8-14-2012-completed/?do=findComment&comment=576507)

So let's get this started!

 

After two attempts in which I didn't get enough Emyn Muil locations (both > 150 points), I finally got a good draw. The scenario is super easy if you have Éowyn, so the important thing to get a good result seems to be to draw those VP locations early in the game.

 

Heroes: Théodred, Éowyn, Bilbo

Heroes Threat: 11

Heroes Damage: 0

Rounds: 90

Victory Points: 21 (Amon Hen, Amon Lhaw, East Wall, The Outer Ridge, 2x Highlands, Chieftain Ufthak)

Result: 80

 

Not sure if I remember the encounter order correctly, must have been somewhat like this:

 

1. Pursued by Shadows (+ 1 threat for Bilbo not questing)

2. Highlands

3. Dol Guldur Orcs (damage cancelled with A Test Of Will)

4. Eastern Crows, Highlands

5. East Wall

6. Treacherous Fog

7. Rockslide (hero damage healed with Daughter of the Nimrodel; Théodred, Éowyn and Faramir were hit)

8. The Outer Ridge

9. Chieftain Ufthak

10. Orc Horse Thieves

 

I played 2x GG, 3x Gandalf (2x with Sneak Attack) and used lot of those funny Rohan event cards. Also had Gildor in round 4 or 5 (used Parting Gifts to play DoN and him).

I decided not to travel to the Highlands and waited for my Trackers and Snowbourns, but only in round 8 I got a single Snowbourn Scout to take explore one of the Highlands. Finished the other in my last turn.

 

Edit: lowered Heroes threat from 12 to 11. My counter says 12, but it should be 26 + 9 (rounds) + 1 (PbS) + 2 (OHT) - 12 (2x GG) - 15 (3x Gandalf) = 11.

 Whoops!  Heros were eowyn, Eleanor; dunhere.  Straight spirit/leadership deck.  2x gg to reduce threat and 2x gandalf (one a sneak, one a regular 5 payment) to take out dol Guldur orcs and then the second time to put 4 damage on ufthak.

Meanwhile it's 3 points. lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif]

 

My record was 89 before, so I'm quite satisfied. Chieftain Ufthak safed my day, and I even had enough attacking power to use Gandalf to lower my threat instead of hurting Ufthak.

 I read too quick, 3 pts! Right!  Last two games for me not so good.

## 8 [Zjb12 on January 8, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58619-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-solo-player-tournament-6-january-8-14-2012-completed/?do=findComment&comment=576565)

 New low score:  73.  Damage to Heros: 2; threat: 1; (2 gg, 3 sneaks of gandalf, 1 full price gandalf); 9 rounds (90pts); 20 victory points.  Heros: eowyn; Eleanor; theodred.

## 9 [Zjb12 on January 8, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58619-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-solo-player-tournament-6-january-8-14-2012-completed/?do=findComment&comment=576567)

 Forgot, vps were: Amon hen & lhaw; 3x highlands; Roth stair; outer ridge; shores of nen hithoel.

## 10 [muemakan on January 9, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58619-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-solo-player-tournament-6-january-8-14-2012-completed/?do=findComment&comment=576827)

So here we go...

Legolas, Beravor and Denethor. ( Used 3 core sets and cards from every AP except Carrock) 

Final threat: 0

Wounds: 0

Victory points: 21 ( Amon Lhaw and Hen, Rauros Falls, The Outer Ridge, The Shores of Nen Hithoel, Eastwall of Rohan and Highlands)

Encounters:

1. Slick Footing ( decided not to move it to the bottom of the deck due to it giving me a rather safe first round and getting my cards in play) 

2. Impassable Chasm and Highlands ( Denethor: Impassable Chasm move to bottom)

3. Dol-Guldur Orcs ( Denethor: Enchanted Stream move to bottom)

4. The Outer Ridge ( Denethor: Easter Crows move to bottom)

5. Rauros Falls ( Denethor: Dol-Guldur Orcs move to bottom)
 
6. Eastwall of Rohan 
 
7. The Shores of Nen Hithoel
 
Rounds 6
 
Final score: 39
 
Played 6 games in total. Switched Eowyn with Denethor after the first 2 games. 2 of the other games were forfeit after loosing a hero. The 3 others were forfeit after having already played 10 rounds and still victory points missing.
 
 

## 11 [Zjb12 on January 9, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58619-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-solo-player-tournament-6-january-8-14-2012-completed/?do=findComment&comment=577069)

 Well, this should have been a 61, but I chose to cancel a treachery card with Eleanor and that meant another emyn muil location came out when I would have been done, so while I saved three damage, I needed another round, so my score ended up at 68.

Heros: denethor, Eleanor, eowyn.  6 rounds, threat 31, no damage or dead Heros.  23 victory points:  Amon hen & lhaw; 2x east wall of Rohan; north stair; outer ridge; shores of nen hithoel.

 

## 12 [Zjb12 on January 9, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58619-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-solo-player-tournament-6-january-8-14-2012-completed/?do=findComment&comment=577076)

 IN hindsight, I guess I would have had a 64 since I would also have had 3 less victory points.  Oh well, 68 it is!  Muemaken, good job on your 39!!!

## 13 [Vase on January 10, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58619-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-solo-player-tournament-6-january-8-14-2012-completed/?do=findComment&comment=577167)

 Not a great score, but I wanted to at least post SOMETHING after my no-show in last week's tourney:

 

Heroes: Dunhere, Eleanor, Eowyn

Threat: 25

Damage: 2

Round Tracker: 80

V.P.s: 22

TOTAL: 85

## 14 [juicebox on January 10, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58619-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-solo-player-tournament-6-january-8-14-2012-completed/?do=findComment&comment=577225)

Heroes: Éowyn, Dunhere, Denethor

Total Threat: 22

Hero Wounds: 2

Victory Points: -25

Final Score: 79

## 15 [leptokurt on January 10, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58619-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-solo-player-tournament-6-january-8-14-2012-completed/?do=findComment&comment=577591)

After many tries in which I got scores of 150+ (or lost), I finally was treated kindly by the encounter deck:

 

Heroes: Théodred, Éowyn

Heroes Threat: 17

Heroes Damage: 2

Rounds: 60

Victory Points: 21 (Amon Hen, Amon Lhaw, 2x Outer Ridge, North Stair, 2x Highlands, Shores of Nen Hithoel)

Result: 58

 

Encounters:

1) Slick Footing (travelled to Amon Hen)

2) Eastern Crows, Outer Ridge (travelled to Amon Lhaw)

3) North Stair (traveled to, got Highlands as new encounter)

4) Highlands (travelled to, got Outer Ridge as new encounter)

5) Treacherous Fog, (travelled to Outer Ridge)

6) Shores of Hen Nithoel (travelled to Shores of Nen Hithoel)

7) Slick Footing

 

Explored Highlands with Snowbourn Scouts, explored one Outer Ridge by using Riddermark's finest action,

 

Cards played (don't know the exact order anymore): 2x Escort from Edoras (one early, one late in the game), 2x Snowbourn Scout (rounds 3 and 6?), Faramir (round 5?), Ancient Mathom (round 2), Steward of Gondor (round 2, plaed on Éowyn), Galadrim's Greeting, Sneak Attack (Henamarth, round 7), Ride to Ruin (round 3) used to clear North Stair, discarded Snowbourn Scouts)

 

 

Unfortunatly I got no Gandalf, otherwise I could have scored 10 points less (had Sneak Attack in my hand all the time).

 Did u really only use 2 Heros or was that a typo?

I used only Theo and Eo. Théodred's response gave me the third resource, and Éowyn's WP is as good as the combined WP of 2 heroes. The only real problem is your defense. You have to survive the first two round. If you get an enemy at this point (DG Orcs or Horse Thieves) you're basically screwed.

 

Btw, i have Songs of Wisdom in this deck, so it's a three sphere deck.

A few more attempts tonight... a couple were nothing worth reporting, but then there was this juicy romp:

Heroes: Éowyn, Dúnhere, Denethor

Total Threat: 15

Hero Wounds: 0

Victory Points: -21

Rounds: 70

Total Score: 64

That breaks my personal best for this adventure by 1 point. gran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif]

Granted, I have not played this adventure a ton. Still, satisfying.

Why did you get Highlands as a new encounter?

The 2 hero strategy seems quite interesting.... I think you´r the first one to try this in the tournaments.

Because of the "forced" effect of North Stair.

 

The 2 hero varaint came to my mind when I had 5+ games in which I had tons of resources, tons of WP and was sitting there, waiting for some VP points to appear from the oncounter deck. Emyn Muil is a very special adventure, as the DG Orcs is the only enemy which is able to attack you during your first couple of turns. The Horse Thieves can be problematic too, because of their 3 threat points.

So, if you're sending all your heroues questing anyway, Théodred counts as two heroes (esourcewise, and Éowyn counts as two heroes WP-wise. You loose however the third heroes special ability (Denethor!)

 

P.S.: Why do I type 10x faster than the letters appear?

 Got the AP today and tried the scenario for the first time. Didn't get a great score, but hey it's a start!

Heroes: Beravor, Denethor.

Total Threat: 23

Hero Wounds: 2

Victory Points: -20

Rounds: 80

Final Score: 85

By the way, Rauros Falls doesn't prevent you to exhaust characters BEFORE the quest phase, right?

 Heroes in the last post should be Eowyn, Beravor, Denethor.

 I have always wondered that same thing.

Made another try today. I used Denethor's ability almost every round, but it still took me 10 turns to find all those locations.

Heroes: Beravor, Denethor, Eowyn

Total Threat: 6

Hero Wounds: 0

Victory Points: -21

Rounds: 90

Final Score: 75

## 26 [Memetix on January 12, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58619-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-solo-player-tournament-6-january-8-14-2012-completed/?do=findComment&comment=578435)

I received the Hill of Emyn Muil yesterday and had a chance to play it today. I built a pure spirit deck and got a score of 83 and realised I needed a way to speed up discovery of  victory point locations so I put in Denathor and used him every turn to skip over encounters that didn't give victory points.

Heroes: Denethor, Frodo, Eowyn (Starting threat 26)

Victory Points: 20 (Amon Hen, Amon Lhaw, The outer ridge, The east walls of Rohan, The shores of Nen Hithoel, Rauros falls)

Damage: 0

Turns: 6 (completed in quest phase of turn 6)

Threat: 26 + 5 (turns)  -5 (Gandalf) - 6 (Greeting) = 20

Score = 50+20+0-20 = 50

With Denethor's help I got lucky with my encounter draws, getting a VP location on each turn. I managed to clear 1 with the "ride to ruin", the rest were explored.

## 27 [ClydeCloggie on January 12, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58619-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-solo-player-tournament-6-january-8-14-2012-completed/?do=findComment&comment=578469)

 Managed to sneak in one game, with a Spirit/Leadership deck of Imrahil/Eowyn/Frodo.

Rounds: 10

Threat: 33

Wounds: 4

VPs: 25 (21 location and Ufthak)

Score: 100 + 33 + 4 - 25 = 112

 

Not a great score, obviously. It started off great. Three EM locations in the first three rounds, which could be played away through Riddermark's Finest and Snowbourne Scout, Summoned as Rohirrim. So after four rounds I had played away 5 locations including Amon Hen and Amon Lhaw. Then the location flow dried up, and it was a matter of waiting around for the right ones to show up. Unfortunately that took six more turns as my heroes and allies battled Dol Guldur Orcs, Ufthak, and hosts of Crows.

Denethor would definitely be needed for a good score on this quest, I think. Hopefully I will find the time to improve on this one...

Got 3 games in today, the thrid finally something tangible.

 

Heroes: Eowyn, Theodred, Denethor

Score: 53

Win on turn 8 (70)

Threat 0

Damage 4

Victory Points 21

 

Unexpected Courage on denethor is nice and allowed me to not see a single enemy. And after I had everything under control and "just" waited for the final victory points I could do some shenanigans like:

 

exhaust Gleowine to draw a card.

Discard Gleowine with Ride to Ruin

Play a fresh Gleowine and use him again (got me the final Galadrims Greetings).

 

So it was fun, but still feels a little random with the locations either showing up or not.

 THe encounter deck was very good to me finally:  42!  Monosphere deck, except for 3 gandalfs.  Was able to use him once and two gg.  Early northern tracker was a big help.

Heros: Frodo, eowyn, Eleanor.

Rounds 5 (50)

Threat 12

Victory points 20, Amon hen, lhaw, 2x highlands; north stair, shores of nen hithoel, rauros falls.

(p.s tried leptokurts idea of 2 heroes, with the same deck minus frodo.  I think I could have won, but could not get the score low enough.)

 THe encounter deck was very good to me finally:  42!  Monosphere deck, except for 3 gandalfs.  Was able to use him once and two gg.  Early northern tracker was a big help.

Heros: Frodo, eowyn, Eleanor.

What did you spent the other 3 resources on? And what was your 6th encounter card?

 Lorien guide.  The last was driven by shadow which surged double kuz no active location and kuz of the quest card.  This brought about imapssable chasm which also surged.  Then they brought down encanted stream and beast master for a threat of 6 against will power of 8.  Hope that makes sense.

 If the last location you needed was explored with the tracker, I think the last encounter card would not have mattered anyway.....

I had one final epic game tonight where the locations just kept coming during the last few turns.

Heroes: Beravor, Denethor, Eowyn

Total Threat: 0

Hero Wounds: 0

Victory Points: 27

Rounds: 70

Final Score: 43

I scored ten locations. One of them was pulled up from the discard when I travelled to The North Stair. I also used Denethor's ability ten times during the game (he had two UC:s). I really think this quest is fun and challenging!

 By the way I used three coresets and every AP that was allowed.

Did you get just locations and one enemy?

Why could´t you get rid of the locations earlier?

Well done all! We're about to round the bend toward the finish with this particular cycle, but congratulations to everyone who joined in this week. I continue to really enjoy hosting these, and I'm grateful for every ounce of participation. You all really make it great! So, thanks for playing!!

This tournament is now completed.

Well as I said I used Denethor a lot and I only got two cards that were not Emyn Muil Locations: Eastern Crows that surged a location early in the game (turn 2), and in turn 6 I got Treacherous Fog. If I had played smarter I might have been able to finish the game in turn 6, but I think I lacked one resource to be able to play the Riddersmarks Finest I would have needed to explore the last location in the staging area. However I don't think that would have improved my score since I hadn't been able to deal properly with my threat by then. In turn seven I once again thought I would be able to end the game since I could play two RF, but I suddenly realized that I couldn't use their ability to explore the location that was drawn as an encounter because Rauros Falls was active. However going yet another turn actually gained me another few points since I was able to lower my threat from 10 to 0 AND score another location.

I must say I really liked this scenario (I know that many others don't). If it hadn't been for this tournament I probably wouldn't have got it in the first place since it has got such bad reviews, but it proved to be one of my favourites so far. So thanks a lot Juicebox!

Happy to hear!  gran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif]

And your enjoyment showed up with results too - you placed in the top three!!

Nice job Fatty.

I also like it, but it's less fun when you play for the result only. Before this tournament I used to challenge Emyn Muil without the help of Éowyn and other WP-monsters. It's harder, but a lot more fun IMO.
