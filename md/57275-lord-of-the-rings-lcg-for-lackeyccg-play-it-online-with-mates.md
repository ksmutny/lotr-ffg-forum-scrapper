UPDATE
 
Finally found what I think could be a replacement host for DropBox... GitHUB
 
I have uploaded the lackeyCCG Plugin to this server as well as incorporated some slight changes.
 
• ADDED : Cycle 04

 

• Voice of Isengard (Delux)

• The Ring Maker Cycle

 
• CHANGED : New Keybindings
• CHANGED : Removed the Truncated Button Names
 
Apart from that it is pretty much the same as it ever was.

> You can set your own keyboard functions to anything you wish, by clicking PREFERENCES button and then clicking KEYBINDINGS. These are just what I use. Feel free to change ANY button but the F11!! and the F12.. if you change these you will break some of the scripting functions. Remember you can always update form the url at any time to reset everything to defaults.
>  
> Keybindings in Lackey are pervasive across the application, so if you use "t" for take control, then every time you type "t" in the chat window it will trigger the hotkey. So I am using CTRL+T and CTRL+SHIFT+T to turn On and Off tokens. There is a bug in LackeyCCG at the moment that makes windows systems beep if you use ALT+t.... so for now it is SHIFT+T.. but will go back to ALT once the bug is fixed.

NOTE
 
I do not really play this game much anymore. This plugin will probably not get another update.. unless I get help from another. The truth is that I have moved most of my play into TableTop Simulator. There is also OCTGN.
 
The big plus of LackeyCCG over OCTGN was that it was that it also had iOS support.
 
If you wish to help
 
If you wish to help with this plugin then PM me on this forum and speak up.. all I really need is someone to enter the data into the cardtext file, as I hate doing that. I can then produce all the cards needs and get the plugin updated on the server.

Looking forward to trying it with the APs.  A couple buddies and I tried it a while ago.  It was a little slow, but played okay.  We abandoned it since it did not keep up with our actual decks.

I have been playing with the OP and our friend HilariousPete. It is a bit clunky but it works really well. We use skype so we can communicate and there is also an ingame chat if you don't have a Mic. If anyone wants to play please let me know, I'm always up for a game and I'd love the chance to meet some new players :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Tragic,

MAN thank you for the work you put into this!  I downloaded it last night and I really enjoyed it!

Just for the record, I own the Core and all the Mirkwood Cycle expansions and I can't wait to buy the new Expansion.

So, just one question:

Unless I missed the trick...It's kind of a pain to have to manually drag the encounter cards back to the encounter card discard pile.  The problem is that I have to switch from viewing my "Hand" and back several times durring a round.  Of course I can just drag the discard cards off to the side until i'm done with the round but I liked the ability to right click a card and send it to the discard piles. 

Is there any plan (or way) to add the right click -> TOP OF Encounter Discard Deck for the encounter cards and shadow card?

Thanks!!!

 

## 5 [TragicTheBlathering on December 12, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57275-lord-of-the-rings-lcg-for-lackeyccg-play-it-online-with-mates/?do=findComment&comment=566885)

I have been PM'd on other sites and YouTube about this a lot, so I thought it best to copy this reply into the 3 posts I have on the various forums....

Q1 - How come there is no RIGHT CLICK on CARD/SEND TO TOP OF ENCOUNTER DISCARD option?
Q2 - Dose the RIGHT CLICK on DECK TAB/REVEAL TOP X CARDS work correctly? It seams wired.

Short Answer
Q1 - No. There is no RIGHT CLICK on CARD/SEND TO TOP OF ENCOUNTER DISCARD, yet.

Q2- No. The "reveal" functions do not work on the encounter deck. Do not use it. BUT it works 100% for the player decks, so use this for "Gandalf's Search" or "Mountains of Mirkwood" or "Gildor Inglorion" or any card that scrys the PLAYER DECK. Eventually you will be able to use this function on the encounter deck but as yet it is NOT possible.

Long Answer
LackeyCCG is a constant work in progress, the addition of "shared zones" witch I am using for the encounter deck is relitivly new addition to lackey. So at this time there are some problems though they will be addressed eventually.

Q1 - The best way to handle the "encounter discard" is to open the encounter discard pile on the right hand column. Then simply drag the discarded encounter cards to it. Remeber there are game functions that key off the discard decks ORDER. So it is important to drag to the correct place, this means the VERY TOP of the discard pile. This can be irksome as well due to the fact the it is very easy to drag to the wrong place as the position slider on the far left can sometimes not be pushed always to the top, so while it looks like you are dragging to the correct position you are in fact dragging to somewhere in the middle of the deck. So if you use this method, you need to make sure you drag to the TOP of the column, and also that the slider bar is hard pushed to the TOP.

7148316.jpg [http://www3.picturepush.com/photo/a/7148316/220/7148316.jpg] [http://www3.picturepush.com/photo/a/7148316/img/7148316.jpg]

The other method, is more safe, but can be a bit annoying, as the "drag" target is small especially on high resolution monitors. Still, this is the safest method, if you drag the card you wish to discard to either of the ENCOUNTER DISCARD tabs, it will always place the card on the top of the encounter deck in the correct place.

7148314.jpg [http://www1.picturepush.com/photo/a/7148314/220/7148314.jpg] [http://www1.picturepush.com/photo/a/7148314/img/7148314.jpg]

Q2 - The "RIGHT CLICK on DECK/REVEAL TOP X CARDS" function works 100% perfectly on the player decks.

At the moment though it dose NOT WORK on the encounter deck. Simply do not use it. Remember most card affects that allows you to scry the encounter deck, for example Hunt for Gollum quest effect or Denathor's ability are "private" effects due to the "no table talk" rule. The scry'n decisions are NOT group decisions.

So until the "RIGHT CLICK on DECK/REVEAL TOP X CARDS" function on the encounter deck can select individual players to only be able to see the cards, it is not usable and be legal to the rules of the game. For at the moment when using this function "everyone" can see the cards and there is no way to stop that.

On top of that, the popup window is unable to send cards to the correct discard pile, so that needs to be fixed as well, and I am sure it will be addressed when ever the LackeyCCG designer gets a chance. He is very busy and of course needs to consider many more games than just LoTRs when he is doing upgrades to LackeyCCG.

on the encounter deck is not working either. Witch is why in my game demo for HFG I scryed the encounter deck using the "drag" method. This is defiantly the most irksome bug in lackey for LoTR-LCG and needs to be addressed b4 I can claim this plugin is 100% conversion. Still this will be fixed in latter releases of LackeyCCG.

For now rule of thumb is SIMPLY DO NOT USE THIS FUNCTION ON THE ENCOUNTER DECK.

For an demo on how to scry the encounter deck.. click this link... for now this is the only way to do it legally according to the rules.

Using Denathor -



HFG Quest Effect -


I hope this helps!

Have fun

I've got lackey and OCTGN. I was trying to organize a group of people to play but was having some trouble.

I also tried out an alternate method of long distance gaming using physical cards. I put a post up on my blog about that just yesterday actually: tabletopgeeks.com/long-distance-gaming/ [http://tabletopgeeks.com/long-distance-gaming/]

Thanks! Good to know that someone is enjoying it. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] If you have friends to play with and enjoy competitive games, Warhammer Invasion is definitely fun to play.

Back on topic... silverhand, it probably won't be until after the holidays but I'll try and email you at some point to play. You can also add me on Skype as I'm trying to accumulate friends on there to play LCGs with. My skype name is svennethir.

Version 2.1.1 Is up!

Fixed: The Provided Hunt for Gollum Encounter deck to include the correct Encounter Cards

Fixed: Dunedain Mark now displays as a Attachment, instead of a Event

Change: Changed the naming conventions for all Encounter Cards, so that now grouping by "sphere" in the deck editor will place all encounter cards in the same block for easy readability.

Added: Added 6 new Custom Quests made by NinjaDorg. Check them out in this thread at BBG - boardgamegeek.com/filepage/66659/ninjadorgs-lotr-lcg-scenarios [http://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/66659/ninjadorgs-lotr-lcg-scenarios]

 Thanks for doing this I find it a lot easier to leave a game set up on lackey than out on the table with my two year old running around. Looking forward to trying the extra custom quests! 

When are you expecting to release catc?

## 13 [silverhand77 on December 16, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57275-lord-of-the-rings-lcg-for-lackeyccg-play-it-online-with-mates/?do=findComment&comment=568409)

On a side note to the main discussion here, I would like to say that I don't think it is appropriate to play this game on any online platform if you haven't already purchased the actual cards or at least intend to and by that I mean are wating for them to become available. If you don't have the actual cards, you are essentially stealing from FFG. As it is, FFG already limit the usable card pool in that AP's have to have been availbe for 6 months before they can be included in a plug-in. If FFG were to discover that people were using the online versions and not purchasing the actual cards, they may ban online play completely, which could reult in legal action for copyright infingement etc.

If we can show that we are respecting the fact that FFG need to make money from this game so they can keep creating and expanding it by continuing to purchase the cards, They may start to actually sanction the use of online platforms and allow us to use the full card pool instead of having to wait 6 months as is currently the case.

So I would like to appeal to all existing or would-be online players, Please make sure you buy or are intedning to buy ASAP all of the actual cards. It is the right thing to do. Personally, I won't play with anyone who isn't doing t his. I hope everyone else feels the same.

Not sure if it's just me playing on a Mac, but I'm not seeing any of the quest cards for the 6 new custom quests.
Also mark is still displaying as an event for me...

Hmmm, seams a few people have had the "auto-update" thing not working.. I am not sure why.

 

Fix - 1

If you are not getting the update then go into lackeyCCG and press the PREFERENCES button, look for the PLUGIN tab, and there should be a button called "Install or Update Plugin".. press this and it should manually update.

If Fix 1 not work .. try Fix 2!

If there is STILL no update, go into the plugin dir of lackey and remove this file.... "pluginsLoTRlcgsetsCardDataFiles.txt" Then do a manual update.

If Fix 2 don't work Trry Fix 3!

That should fix it all for sure.. BUT if you are still having problems.. just completely remove the LoTRlcg dir from plugins and reinstall the plugin afresh. If you like backup the dir "pluginsLoTRlcgsetssetimages" to save the card images, and make shore you back up any player decks you have made "pluginsLoTRlcgdecks"

Hope that helps!

Yes I realize that there is no way to make sure an opponent has actually bought cards, but I will ask anyway. It may be human nature as you say to not pay if you can get it for free, but that doesn't make it right.

I assure you that both of your points had crossed my mind, which is why I made my post in the first place. I'm just hoping that anyone who might want to play online has considered the fact that they should actually buy the cards too.

First I would like to say: thank you for this plugin it has helped to learn the game, when I know no people who play it in my neighbourhood.

 

I don't know if the culling of the barrow downs is also part of your plugin or someone else's but the Erestor hero card has a picture of Anborn, also from TcaB.

Again keep up the good work!

UPDATE - Version 2.3

 * ADDED: - A.Journey.to.Rhosgobel Adventure Pack
 * ADDED: - Custom Quest by John Davis - Sarn Gorwing [http://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/74001/now-quest-sarn-gorwing]
 * ADDED: - Key-Binding Control for NEXT TURN (F7 default)
 * CHANGED: - Resource Font Text to Yellow (easier to read)
 * CHANGED: - Renamed the Ninjadorg Custom Quests. (Please Delete the old ones, or you will have 2)
 * CHANGED: - A Ton of behind the Scene Stuff
 * FIXED: - The Custom Hero "Erestor" now displays the correct card. (thanks to Sylvicolus for pointing this out)


Ok well that is it.. hope you like it.. this is one of the hardest quest in the game so far, especially when you have the limited card pool that is currently available in lackey.. please try to refrain from punching your computer monitor!

Please let me know if there are any problems.

NOTE: - LackeyCCG is having some extensive work done it at the application level by Trevor. I have been playing with the beta and I am happy to tell you that the "Reveal X cards" on the encounter deck button is 98% working and will most lily be released by the next AP! As well as a number of other small bugs with the encounter deck, like the log not displaying "shuffle" when someone shuffles the deck. The new lackey is not out yet.. but will be soon.

NOTE 2: - All 4 Versions of the plugin will now show in the Plugin Install area. The versions just control resolution and they are MAX, HIGH, MEDIUM and LOW. One of the buttons is slightly cut off, this is the MAX version.. you can still click the button though. (this is on the 2 fix list and will be done soon)

Thanks!

For NinjaDorg quests, I assume the ND1 - ND6 are the old ones to delete?

These 3 don't have the quest cards in the deck file when you choose them, though the quest cards can be found by searching the bottom window.

UPDATE: - Version 2.4

 * * ADDED: - The Hills of Emyn Muil
   * ADDED:- The Massing at Osgiliath
   * ADDED:- Custom Card Tokens
   * ADDED:- Custom Arrow Markers
   * FIXED:- Text Counters for Helper Card

So this is a big update. Including The Hills of Emyn Muil and The Massing at Osgiliath!! Also there have been some big changes a the application level of LackeyCCG from the developer as well....

Most notable is the inclusion of COUNTER IMAGES....

counters [http://www4.picturepush.com/photo/a/7729722/img/7729722.jpg]


So you add counters just as b4, but now it will add the counters form the real game, 1st counter will look like the Witch King card, and as you add more counters text will appear on top of the counter like this. This should mean that no matter the card art, the counters should always be easy to read!

If for any reason your counters are to small and the text is not on top of them (due to scale and monitor issues) there is an option in the PREFERENCES under the APPEARANCE tab where you can set the scale of the counters from 20% to something higher.

options [http://www1.picturepush.com/photo/a/7729724/img/7729724.jpg]


Also for you solo players. You can now add as many players as you like to a solo game! Just right click on the TEST DUMMY player and select ADD SEAT and a new dummy will be added. This is great for deck testing if you are building a 2 or 3 player deck, or just want to play a 2 or 3 deck solo game.

bots [http://www3.picturepush.com/photo/a/7729741/img/7729741.jpg]


Once you are playing, just select yourself in the list (the top one) and use these arrow keys to access the other decks!!

bots2 [http://www2.picturepush.com/photo/a/7729745/img/7729745.jpg]


Also there is a TON of cool /commands for the chat window... so many I can not list them all but some really awesome ones are

/chooseplayer (select a player at random to go first)
/senddeck S (This will send you current deck to the other player neat way of sharing decks if your playing with randoms)


I'm pretty busy nowdays so my videos might be slow.. but I will be doing an updated tutorial that should be way more simple and short and easy to reference with how to use the plugin...


Anyway.. hope you guys like it.. let me know as always if there are any problems!!!

Have fun and Stay Safe

Hi ya tragic, i really enjoy your play through videos. They have helped me a lot gaining various skills on card use as ive only been playing 3 months. Have you got any plans to do a solo Escape from Dol Guldur vid as i havent won in 20 attempts. Im gradually buying APs which are expanding my deck choices but this quest is still a pig. Cheers and thanks for doing the vids.

UPDATE - Version 2.4.1

 * ADDED: - Hover Card Function (Right Click on Card to access it)
 * ADDED:- New Generic Counter for "reminders"
 * FIXED:- Card Image for Descendant and Gildor now display correctly
 * FIXED:- Wandering Took is back in the Leadership sphere
 * CHANGE:- Tweaked the resource icon counter image

== -- == WARNING == -- == WARNING == -- == WARNING == -- == WARNING == -- == WARNING == -- ==

This update changed some fundamental organization of various things behind the scenes to do with function, this WILL effect your keybindings. So after this update, make sure you go into PREFRENCES/KEYBINDINGS and make sure everything is as you want it.

7737177.jpg [http://www4.picturepush.com/photo/a/7737177/img/7737177.jpg]

Another way to get your bindings fixed easily is to to go into your LackeyCCG directory and finding this file....

*LackeyCCG Directory*/plugins/LoTRlcg/pluginpreferences.txt

Then delete it. Now next time LackeyCCG loads it will use the default keybindings I set up for you.

 == -- == WARNING == -- == WARNING == -- == WARNING == -- == WARNING == -- == WARNING == -- == 

Ok, so what is becoming my regular 2nd update a day after the release of the main update due to all the errors people find it UP!!! Enjoy...

Big thanks to Bis2Fioute for pointing out that Descendant and Gildor card images were reversed.. so that is fixed...

Also Duke of Lizards (awesom-o name btw) asked:

 * "every time I play an attachment, it ends up covering up a hero. Then I select the hero, drag him around and put him back on top. This quickly becomes unwieldy with 4 or 5 attachments to order. Is there a faster way to handle this?"

And I responded:

 * um.. I'm not sure... I do not find it a problem in any way personally, in fact I like it like this as it is exactly how real cards work... Basically I just drag select the cards on the table and move them to the side and place the new card, then drag the stacks of stuff with the hero at the top and then place it again. There used to be options in lackey to set it so that placing a card will always go to the bottom, but these options seam to be gone. There is a option called HOVER I have not set up that I can add to the card functions that will make a card unselectable... but all cards will be placed on table go under it... this might be a option... I'll look into this for you.

So I looked into it and it worked pretty neat.. so I did it!!! WOOOT

So if you select a card and hit ALT+H (default binding) or right click on the card and select HOVER it will raise that card into the air, off the table. Now any card that is put on it, will go underneath. You can tap and add counters while it is hovering if you like so you can always have it hovering, or you can raise it up, then place your attachments then drop it on the table and it will land on top of everything.


Also, I added a new counter for "reminders" here are a 3 examples of how it is meant to be used.....

cards [http://www5.picturepush.com/photo/a/7737253/img/7737253.jpg]

As you can see it is just a nice bright generic counter you can use to track modified stats, like in this example Gimli has 3 wounds, so he is now hitting for 5. So this counter is just to remind us of that. The Hunter card has a "4" on it.. cause there is 1 Clue token in play, witch gives him +2 attack / Defense... again just to remind us. And on the Quest card, I use this counter to denote victory points....


Anyway... this is about it I think!!

Please let me know if there are any more errors!!

Have Fun and Stay Safe

Thanks man!! I appreciate that.

I do get asked for a Dol Guldur video a lot, and I will do one, but not until I have access to the Khazad Dum card pool. This quest is just to hard for me to play solo especially with play a limited card pool. I know it is beatable and stuff.. but I simply do not enjoy playing it.

Though once the card pool gets bigger I will post a video for that quest... and I should get around to the other quest as well. Like after Khazs solo players have the good to run Guldur and it is a very fun solo quest now imo.. just not back in the day. I think a lot of the "hard" quests will be like this as the card pool gets larger.. bringing life to old quests.

As always, if you experience problems the fastest way to fix is to just delete the entire Plugin Dir and just download it again form the server … just remember to backup your player decks.. so Del this dir!! (<lackeyccg root>pluginsLoTRlcg)

Hi guys!! Yes Khaz is a month early!! woot… but I will be busy so here it is now!! Have fun and go bash those orcs!!! This will be the last update for a while as there was a break in release over Christmas of LoTRlcg… The 1st Pack of Darrowdelf was released on March 2012 [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=3114]… So this means I'll be releasing that pack in September.. so in 3 months!! Do not worry I plan to do some cool stuff on this still as in I will be adding lost of Custom Quests!

-----------------

Speaking of Custom Quests, the guy that did "The Barrowdowns" arguably one of the best quest for LoTRs including the official ones has made a new quest and I have added it to LackeyCCG.

Read all about it here!! [http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/805266/feonixs-custom-scenario-4-raid-on-the-river-carn]

Again it is a fantastic quest and easy to print out.. in fact I might make a video on how to easily make a custom card pack wit hout a lot of pain. One of the cool things is this time he has made a entirly unique encounter deck (like Massing uses) so there is no problem with mixing encounter cards and them looking slightly different.

Anyway, that has been added to lackeyCCG anyway and i strongly suggest you check it out!

-----------------

Also I have fixed some problems with the default keybindings … they should now be all working …

CRT+LEFT CLICK = Flip a Card
HOLD SHIFT + MOUSE OVER (Peak at the other side of the card without flipping it)

F1 = Refresh ALL
F2 = Draw Card

F3 = Next Phase
F4 = Last Phase

F5 = Draw Encounter Card
F6 = Draw Shadow Card

F7 = New Turn

ALT+Q / CRT+Q = Resource Token (Add / Remove)
ALT+W / CRT+W = Wound Token (Add / Remove)
ALT+E / CRT+E = Quest Token (Add / Remove)

ALT+A / CRT+A = Helper Card Counter 1 (Add / Remove)
ALT+S / CRT+S = Helper Card Counter 2 (Add / Remove)
ALT+D / CRT+D = Helper Card Counter 3 (Add / Remove)

ALT+Z / CRT+Z = Purple Generic Token (Add / Remove)
ALT+X / CRT+X = Orange Generic Token (Add / Remove)
ALT+C / CRT+C = Yellow Generic Token (Add / Remove)

ALT+V = Toggle Draw Mode ON / OFF
CRT+V = Clear Markings

ALT+R = Roll 6 sided Dice
ALT+F = Flip Coin

Useful Console Commands

Remember lackeyCCG has a huge list of consol commands to let you do awesome stuff… see the full list here! [http://www.lackeyccg.com/tutoriallogcommands.html]Though here are some real useful ones!

/save NameYouChoose (Save the current game, includes all decks)
/load NameYouChoose (Load a save game)

/senddeck # (This command will send you deck to the other player and download it directly to their deck folder, replace the # with their seat number.. so if their name is 3rd in the list it would be "/senddeck 3"

As always, if you experience problems the fastest way to fix is to just delete the entire Plugin Dir and just download it again form the server … just remember to backup your player decks.. so Del this dir!! (pluginsLoTRlcg)


Version 3.1

ADDED:- Orc Hunt (Custom Quest) [http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/828088/new-custom-quest-orc-hunt]
ADDED - The Fall of Dale (Custom Quest) [http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/818448/feonixs-custom-scenario-5-the-fall-of-dale]
ADDED - Eagle Token (For Eagles of Misty Mountains)
CHANGED -All Players now sit on same side of table (Should make it better for solo players running multiple decks)
CHANGED -Eagle Tokens used to Eagle player card backs
REMOVED - Progress, Wound and Quest Token from Token Area


Please let me know if anything needs fixing!!

Guys I know Vassel and OTGN2 have more current cards. The plug makers do this against the express wishes of FFG and are basically pirates and being illegal. My plugin conforms with the requirement to wait 6 months after the real cards are released b4 releasing the virtual cards.

I'm not going to release them faster.. please stop asking! You may use OTGN or Vassel if you have no moral problems with disregarding the wishes of the designers.  month

  Hey Tragic.

It's super that the players now sit at the same site of the table in your new update. But it seems there's a problem regarding save games. After update when I load a saved game it's all screwed up. Like Heroes replaced with quest and encounter deck cards from the custom quest cards. I have deleted and reinstalled the plugin severel times now but it's the same every time. The save games are ok in the old version but everytime I update they gets all screwed up. And it's the same cards that are replaced/replacing the cards every time. Any ideas why? Of cause I can play with the old version and just use the plugininfo.txt from the new update but it would be nice if it could be fixed for the future, as I also have to copy all custom cards manually. And I'll miss any other changes made prbably. And I like to collect so I try to have all cards in all 4 resolutions all time :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Also, the problem with the helper card is still there. Don't know if you got my note about it last time, but here it is again :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] The helper card values doesn't ever show up when it's 1. You won't see turn 1, will 1 or threat 1. When you get to 2 and more it's okay but for some reason the 1 doesn't show.

Oh, and the tokens are there still under the token fan…not that it really matters :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] just wanted to mention it if it means anything for you.

I have the mac version so it might just be in this version that there are some bugs.

 

All for now. Great plugin. This makes me play the game even more often than before and is developing me as a gamer. Thanks man

Hi Tragic.
I have tested your new update and it's just awesome the way you can now play two player at the same side of the table. But I have some problems after you added the latest custom quests. Now when I load my older decks or save games it's all screwed up. Heroes get exchanged with encounter cards and quest cards and the like. I have deleted the plugin severel times but it's stil the same. Also, I think you misunderstood me in my earlier post. My point was that in your videos when you use the helper card you can use the number "1" both in turn 1 , 1 will power or 1 threat. But when I do it it's just blank. Nothing happens until I get to "2".

Kind regs and looking forward to getting the Dwerowdwelf AP's when it's legal around sep/oct

I strongly recommend you simply delete the plugin folder and then do a fresh install form the menu… This will fix all these "issues"

LackeyCCG is a native Mac application in fact.. so that has no affect.

Still what you are seeing here is the fact that I am using these tokens in a way that is not strictly the way it was designed. The way LackeyCCG works is that you add one token and it shows an image of the token, then you add a 2nd token and it puts a number on top of that image.. as there are NO tokens for those helper values witch you use on the helper card .. number 1 is always invisible.. there is no immediate way around this… and I have nvr considered it a problem to be bothered fixing.. though I have an idea of a way I can adjust this if it is a real pain.. but as I said.. i do not think it is a issue..

I didn't want to implement any deletion stuff into the update as many people like to mod the plugin to add there own stuff.. If those icons are still showing in the token area it is as the images are there from the last time you installed it. This doesn't effect it at all.It seems there's a problem regarding save games.

I am not 100% sure what you mean here, but it may be simply that old save games are not compatible with the update. There was some changes to the card names themselves in some cases to allow for the use of cards that have the exact same name (way to go FFG lol) .. so these might be the cards you have that are acting wrong.

Still save games work.. just make new ones. I do not think you will be able to load your older save games is all.

 Okay, got it :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] I'll try the update again and make a save game through this new update and see what happens.

As always, if you experience problems the fastest way to fix is to just delete the entire Plugin Dir and just download it again form the server … justs remember to backup your player decks.. so Del this dir!! (pluginsLoTRlcg)

 


Version 4

 


ADDED: Redhorn Gate AP (1st of Darrowdelf)

ADDED: Aside Encounter Deck Zones

ADDED: Victory Pile Deck Zone | ADDED: Mulligan Sound

ADDED: Mulligan Button | ADDED: Save and Load Buttons

CHANGED: All encounter deck now have any "out of play" cards used in set up placed in the new ASIDE deck zone for quicker game starts!

FIXED: Sarn Gorwing Custom Quest Deck!


Please let me know if anything needs fixing!!

Ok… so I finally found time toi update this plugin.. only 18 days late!! wtf… do not worry I'll update it as soon as the new month starts so you will not be waiting as long for the next pack…

 


BIG NEWS!! Darrowdelf has started… so get on and start hitting the trail

 


Also, I have made some pretty major changes to the plugin. I Strongly recommend backing up your OWN decks and DELETING THE ENTIRE PLUGIN DIR AND INSTALLING FROM SCRATCH.

 

I have added 2 new deck zones… as there are more and more quests that require shuffling of the quest deck. So now you will see that there is a new button called "DRAW QUEST" this will draw a quest card form the top of the quest deck (LEFT). You can still play as always, but if you are playing say FLIGHT FROM MORIA, you can now put the quest cards in the quest deck zone and use the shuffle and other deck functions!

 

I have also added a new deck zone called "VICTORY" so you may drag your victory cards into this area now if you wish.

 

Also ALL the encounter decks have been changed. So i strongly recommend you deleting them all and re-downloading. This is because I have added yet another deck zone called "ASIDE". This deck zone contains all the Quest 1a setup cards. Like if the quest says "search the encounter deck for card and place in staging area" well that card is now already put aside for you in this aside deck zone. This should speed up quest setup as you will not need to fetch the cards yourself.

 

Also there is a new button in teh canned messages area called "!mulligan!" this will discard your starting hand and then draw 6 cards as well as announcing you are taking a mulligan, next to it is !draw 6! that will draw your starting hand.

 

 

Ok have fun!!!

-----------------

Also I have fixed some problems with the default keybindings … they should now be all working … if not del the plugin and fresh update!


CRT+LEFT CLICK = Flip a Card
HOLD SHIFT + MOUSE OVER (Peak at the other side of the card without flipping it)

F1 = Refresh ALL
F2 = Draw Card

F3 = Next Phase
F4 = Last Phase

F5 = Draw Encounter Card
F6 = Draw Shadow Card

F7 = New Turn

 

F9 = Empty Hand - This moves the top card of your hand to the top of your draw deck. (do not change this keybinding!!)

ALT+Q / CRT+Q = Resource Token (Add / Remove)
ALT+W / CRT+W = Wound Token (Add / Remove)
ALT+E / CRT+E = Quest Token (Add / Remove)

ALT+A / CRT+A = Helper Card Counter 1 (Add / Remove)
ALT+S / CRT+S = Helper Card Counter 2 (Add / Remove)
ALT+D / CRT+D = Helper Card Counter 3 (Add / Remove)

ALT+Z / CRT+Z = Purple Generic Token (Add / Remove)

ALT+C / CRT+C = Yellow Generic Token (Add / Remove)

ALT+M = Toggle Draw Mode ON / OFF
ALT+N = Clear Markings
ALT+R = Roll 6 sided Dice
ALT+F = Flip Coin


Useful Console Commands

Remember lackeyCCG has a huge list of consol commands to let you do awesome stuff… see the full list here! Though here are some real useful ones!

/save NameYouChoose (Save the current game, includes all decks)
/load NameYouChoose (Load a save game)
/senddeck # (This command will send you deck to the other player and download it directly to their deck folder, replace the # with their seat number.. so if their name is 3rd in the list it would be "/senddeck 3"

Hey guys I am back!

Been overseas for ages. Anyway.. I am sad to say that I have stopped playing LoTR having moved on to Star Wars and A:Netrunner as well as Call of Cthulhu (I'll always play that).

I will still host the plugin and as soon as I get my computers out of storage and set up I will update the pulgin to the end of the current cycle

I am looking for someone to take over this plugin. The updating is not that involved and I can get you in touch with a good scanner who will keep you up to date with new cards. I can teach you how to update it and keep it uptodate easily. The plugin is complete so anly set updates and card scans are needed to maintain it.

Alternatively if you update the scans and the set file I will handle the hosting and auto-update
 
If you can not wait there is a OCTGN3 plugin that is currently well maintained but it isn't as g0od as the lackey one for a number of reasons.. one of witch LackeyCCG has save function and crash recovery, so no more disconnection and loose hours of gameplay and also it can be played on most platforms (pc, linux, mac, ipad)  and I "think" I still have more custom quests. There are also all sorts of other little things that make the lackeyccg plugin far superior imo.

Anyway.. sorry ..for quitting on your  but that is life and mine must go on!
--Tragic 

 

PS - Remember to contact me if you wish to take over the upkeep of this plugin!!

Version 5
 
ADDED: Darrowdelf 2: Road to Rivendale
ADDED: Darrowdelf 3: The Watcher in the Water
ADDED: Darrowdelf 4: The Long Dark
ADDED: Darrowdelf 5: Foundations of Stone
ADDED: Darrowdelf 6: Shadow and Flame
ADDED: Saga: The Hobbit: Over Hill and Under Hill
ADDED: Deluxe: Heirs of Numenor Expansion (Censored)
 
CHANGED
There is a pretty major change here. 
 
I am now going to be releasing the entire set as uptodate with the official sets as possible, ignoring the 6 month wait.. BUT the cards in the 6 month period will have their card text blurred out. This way the plugin will comply with the wishes of the copywrite holders, FFG and people can simply replace the blurred cards with their own scans if they wish. 
 
This should stop the fracturing of the user base, as many users were running custom versions of this plugin. Now you can just replace the blurred cards and connect with anyone.. no need to write a personalised plugin anymore!
 
 
 
Please let me know if anything needs fixing!!
 
 
As some of you may know it has been a long time between updates. I was away on holiday for ages, and then I quit this game in favour for other LCGs like Netrunner. 
 
I am looking for someone to take over this plugin and maintain it.
 
The plugin itself is complete and I expect it not to need additional work. All anyone needs to do to update this plugin is look in the plugin dir and see the cardlist.txt file. This is a tab delimitered spreadsheet txt file. You can load it in excel or calc or any speadsheet app. Once you do you can clearly see the pattern of how to fill in new cards. 
 
If anyone wishes to take over the plugin please let me know. PM me on YOUTUBE, BGG, FFG or CARDGAMEDB.
 
To those thinking of taking over.. there are TWO options.
 
1) You take over the entire plugin, including updating and hosting (hosting can be done easy through DropBox.. this is what I am using now). You will need to update the txt file, update the dropbox and update the scans. I can put you in touch with a scanner.
 
This is what I am hoping someone will step up and do.
 
2) The other option is to simply update the cardlist.txt file and email it to me. This is by far the most time consuming part of the update. The data entry. If someone will do this for me. I can host and handle the plugin updates, Until someone wishes to take on the entire show.
 
 
Anyway.. I will be updating the plugin now and then if no one comes around.. 
 
until then… . .
 
Have Fun and ROLL HIGH!!!

Version 6
MASSIVE UPDATE!! I STRONGLY RECOMMEND REMOVING YOUR ENTIRE PLUGIN DIR AND REINSTALLING FORM PREFERENCES MENU!!

Remember to back up your own player decks! Though due to massive changes you may need to rebuild them, check and see if they are missing a card here or there!

ADDED: The Battle of Laketown (uncensored)
ADDED: Saga: The Hobbit 2: On The Door Step (Censored)
ADDED: The Steward's Fear (Censored)
ADDED: Easy Mode Encounter Decks

ADDED: A a 2nd Encounter Deck Zone for use in many of the quest that need such a thing
ADDED: A victory point counter to the player area

UNCENSORED: Deluxe: Heirs of Numenor Expansion!

CHANGE: Redone all encounter deck to use the new 2nd Encounter Area + Aside.
CHANGE: Cleaned up the card button bar so there are many less buttons for ease of use.
CHANGE: Some of there moved buttons made it to the CANNED MESSAGE button area.
CHANGE: Tweaked CANNED MESSAGE buttons for ease of use.
CHANGE: Swapped the Hotkeys for helper counters and generic counters.
CHANGE: Gone though entire card list and remove duplicates, so all errors with loading the wrong card into your deck has stopped.
CHANGE: Synced Card list to match Zorbec's Deck Builder so card export should works seamlessly.
CHANGE: Card Scans have been standardized in size, so all cards are now exactly the same dimensions.
CHANGE: Many Card Scans replaced with new scans of better quality.


TONS OF OTHER STUFF!
Due to the large update please remove the entire plugin dir from lackeyccg. Make sure you back up your own decks.


Please let me know if anything needs fixing!!


Big thanks to eli124 (for ideas on how to improve) and especially cheshirekatzfor helping with the tedious data entry part of the release, as well as DarksBane for CardGameDB and all he dose for the community and Zorbec for his amazing deck editor, that if you are not using then you are simply "doing it wrong".

I know the guy that runs this project, he is on holidays at the mo.. but is planning to update the plugin to the end of Black Riders when he gets home. I think at the mo it is up to Stewards Fear, so plenty of game.

Ok, I got it working. A 13" screen is kinda small, but doable. Not all of the last cycle are out yet, but it's fairly complete.

How do I flip a card over (like a shadow card or quest card)? With the Cthulhu plugin I just right click and "turn over", but that option isn't there for LOTR.

Lord of the Ring: The Card Game

- LackeyCCG Plugin Version 6 -


Hey guys.. long time n see. I am technically on holidays but as I am spending a lot of time on trains and planes and while I had all that time I have been updating the LoTR Plugin on my laptop and playing it a ton...Woot-a-loot-a-lot!

This is BETA... I'll be doing small tweaks as I play, as I travel. So let me know if there are any problems.. may take a little while to settle down. There is a lot of changes. Still everything is going well and it is now fully uptodate with the current release.. apart form the 3 new nightmares that I will add when I get some time. Remember the 6 month wait thing going on for cards that FFG ask for.. I'm still honouring their wishes in this matter.

For Detailed Install Instructions see the bottom of the Post... for the rest... here is the Plugin Link!.. just copy the link (right click copy url) and paste it into the LackeyCCG plugin installer.

Lord of the Rings: The Card Game (LCG) - LackeyCCG Plugin Version 6 [http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9169569/LackeyCCG/LoTR-LCG/updatelist.txt]

Have Fun and ROLL HIGH
--Tragic
 

YOU WILL NEED TO COMPLETELY REMOVE THE OLD PLUGIN FOLDER AND REINSTALL
- This is nearly a full re-write of the plugin -

!! Use latest version of LackeyCCG !!


REMOVED COMPLETELY


 * Time is a real issue for me nowadays and the data entry of this plugin is a chore that borders on work. I do not know how Trevor dose it programing the LackeyCCG himself. He is a saint. To that end. I will NO LONGER be entering all the physical data for the 100s of cards beyond the Name, Number of Copies and Sphere / Encounter set / Type. This is all the info you need to build decks in game, though I would recommend using Zorbec's Deck Builder [http://eric.minet.free.fr/lotrbuilder/dbdownl_en.htm] anyway. This will massively reduce the work load for me and increase my will to get off my butt and do a release! If anyone wants to finish the data entry for me on the provided files I will add it to the official release
 * I have completely dispensed with the various resolutions. Now everything is MAX resolution only.
 * I've changed the naming convention for the Encounter decks. I think this way is much better
   * All decks have a full stop at the start. This will ensure they are all grouped at the top of the file list and any new decks will be below them
   * All decks are numbered near the order of the original release scheduled. The pattern seams to be "Deluxe Expansion, 6x Adventure Packs, Print on Demand, Saga" Nightmare and Easy Mode decks will also follow the same order. There are no Easy or Nightmare versions of Print on Demand decks so far
   * "Normal" decks have no letter in front of them.
   * "Easy Mode" decks all have the Letter "E" at the start
   * "Nightmare" decks all have the letter "N" at the start
   * "Custom Quests" decks all have "Custom" at the start


CHANGES


 * I have removed completely the various resolutions. Now everything is MAX.
 * I have adjusted all the Quest Cards in a way so that they now scale with the Lackey Card Viewer. So you can scale the quest cards like any other using the viewer. This uses PNG files and can make using your own replacements harder to construct, but as they are just Quest cards this is a small problem as you own the cards already right? See below for more details.
   I have re-built form scratch ALL the encounter decks... Easy, Normal, Nightmare and Customs. There may be some errors even though I was careful.. please let me know if you find any.
 * A number of cards have had slight name tweaks to make them unique (Lackey can not handle non-unique card names). All cards should load correctly now. Zorbec will take my name changes into account during his next update to retain compatibility with the Lackey export function.
 * All custom cards now have CUSTOM before their name, and other major deck builder values so they are extremely easy to see and not get confused with official sets.
 * The keyboard functions have been changed. Make sure you read the keyboard layout section of the post or go into options/keybindings and set them to your own desires.
 * The 3 Helper Card Tokens are now normal "extra" tokens that appear on the bottom right side of the a tall card. This is so you now have a total of 6 generic tokens to use as you will on all cards rather than only 3 like before (not including Resources, Questing and Wounds)
 * The "Helper Card" to match the new tokens. It is now vertical and sized so the new position of the helper tokens fit on it.

KeyBoard Functions

You can set your own keyboard functions to anything you wish, by clicking PREFERENCES button and then clicking KEYBINDINGS. These are just what I use. Feel free to change ANY button but the F!! and the F12.. if you change these you will break some of the scripting functions. Remember you can always update form the url at any time to reset everything to defaults.

Keybindings in Lackey are pervasive across the application, so if you use "t" for take control, then every time you type "t" in the chat window it will trigger the hotkey. So I am using SHIFT+T and CTRL+T to turn On and Off tokens. There is a bug in LackeyCCG at the moment that makes windows systems beep if you use ALT+t.... so for now it is SHIFT+T.. but will go back to ALT once the bug is fixed.

CRT+LEFT CLICK = Flip a Card
HOLD SHIFT + MOUSE OVER (Peak at the other side of the card without flipping it)

F1 = Refresh ALL
F2 = Draw Card

] = Next Phase (auto save each advanced phase)
[ = Last Phase
F4 = Advance Turn

F3 = Draw Quest Card
F5 = Draw Encounter Card
F6 = Draw Shadow Card
F7 = Draw 2nd Encounter Card
F8 = Draw 2nd Shadow Card

F12 = Empty Hand - This moves the top card of your hand to the top of your draw deck. (do not change this keybinding!!)

SHIFT+T = Take Control of Card

SHIFT+Q / CRT+Q = Resource Token (Add / Remove)
SHIFT+W / CRT+W = Wound Token (Add / Remove)
SHIFT+E / CRT+E = Quest Token (Add / Remove)

SHIFT+A / CRT+A = Yellow Generic Token (Add / Remove)
SHIFT+S / CRT+S = Red Generic Token (Add / Remove)
SHIFT+D / CRT+D = Purple Generic Token (Add / Remove)

SHIFT+Z / CRT+Z = Blue Generic Token (Add / Remove)
SHIFT+X / CRT+X = Cross Generic Token (Add / Remove)
SHIFT+C / CRT+C = Green Generic Token (Add / Remove)

CTRL+1 = Toggle Draw Mode ON / OFF
CTRL+2 = Clear Drawn Markings

SHIFT+R = Roll 6 sided Dice
SHIFT+F = Flip Coin

For the record I change the hotkeys so they do not use the SHIFT modifiers, as I always use a voice communication and never use the chat window anyway.


There is are some helpful BUTTONS near the chat window.

SAVE - Save the current state of the game
LOAD - Load saved game
DRAW 6 - Shuffle your deck, then draw 6 Cards, then announce in chat you are drawing your star hand
Mulligan - Announce a Mulligan, then discard hand, shuffle deck, draw 6 cards

Useful Console Commands

Remember lackeyCCG has a huge list of console commands to let you do awesome stuff... see the full list at lackeyccg.com [http://www.lackeyccg.com/tutoriallogcommands.html]! Though here are some real useful ones!

/save NameYouChoose (Save the current game, includes all decks)
/load NameYouChoose (Load a save game)
/senddeck # (This command will send you deck to the other player and download it directly to their deck folder, replace the # with their seat number.. so if their name is 3rd in the list it would be "/senddeck 3"

Tragic, it appears the link doesn't work any more.  I've tried to download the plugin into a fresh install of LackeyCCG and I get Error Timeout.

 

Just to be sure I installed a different plugin and it worked without any problems.

 

Any help is appreciated!

drop the https:// to http:// you know like in all the links provided. Just remove the "s"

 

Use RIGHT CLICK  COPY LINK... like it says in the instructions NOT clicking the link then copying it form the URL bar, as it will put the "s" back in.

Hmm, I think you may have a point here.. It looks like DropBox is enforcing the HTTP:// stuff. What Booored says but this could be the problem but dropbox is forcing it so removing the S has no effect anymore.

 

Trevor is working on a hotfix... there is apparently a beta  version of lackey with this problem fixed.. but I can nto find the link! I'll get back to you.

Tragic,

 

A couple of notes:

I've tried both https and http.  Drop box redirects to https if you try to use http so that's why I indicated https in the link.  However, neither work as you noticed.

 

The ZIP file used for LackeyCCG does not properly unzip using the standard Windows file zip tool (Windows 7).  You get error messages about not being able to encrypt the folders.  Not really a problem because I use 7zip as well which handled the file just fine.  Just note that some users may have problems and it may generate more questions for the developer of Lackey.

 

I patiently and eagerly await the new version of Lackey with the fix.  Until then, I thank you, Tragic, for looking into this!

## 79 [TragicTheBlathering on July 20, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57275-lord-of-the-rings-lcg-for-lackeyccg-play-it-online-with-mates/?do=findComment&comment=1162370)

not sure about the zip thing, but the deal was LackeyCCG is in fact a native MAC application. Trevor got it working again with DropBox and marked it "done" but the windows version didn't work and he only noticed recently. It will be fixed asap in the next update.

Lord of the Ring: The Card Game

- LackeyCCG Plugin Version 7 -

So LackeyCCG is finally out for iPad!! Woot-a-loot-a-lot. You can now use lackeyCCG to play on Mac,PC, Linux and iPad, iPhone vs any users on any of the other platforms!

Just a note, I do not own a iPad (android forever, *******!) So if you are having problems with the iPad version the place to ask is the LackeyCCG forums.

I have been meaning to update all my plugins so expect some updates to Star Wars LCG, Death Angel and Android Netrunner.

Also, DropBox should work fine now, there was a problem for a while, where the plugin wouldn't download, that should be fixed. Still, it is a good idea to run the plugin updater as soon as you have installed it as occasionally 1 or 2 files will error in the initial download.

For Detailed Install Instructions see the bottom of the Post... for the rest... here is the Plugin Link!.. just copy the link (right click copy url) and paste it into the LackeyCCG plugin installer.

I admire your efforts for that Programm. Are there really so many people who play with lackey? For me it's incredible laborious. I prefer OCTGN.

## 86 [TragicTheBlathering on October 7, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57275-lord-of-the-rings-lcg-for-lackeyccg-play-it-online-with-mates/?do=findComment&comment=1291097)

i feel the same way about octgn.. it is just a matter of taste. LackeyCCG for me is far superiour. Run on Mac, Pc, Linux, iPad (android is in the works). Has auto save, +crash recovery, built in support for true solo multi-hand (you can just add in dummy players). Has simple editable resources for adding your own cards, custom or w/e. Allows lan connections, proxy tunneling and multiplatform global server. OCTGN can not do any of that. I mean, not having a save and load or crash recovery is enough for me.

Still, I think it is all about personal taste. Both options are avaluble so people can just choose which ever they wish.

Though it should be noted that as I am very busy with many projects + life so this plugin and all the others I run on this and other table top apps are not updated as much as the OCTGN one. If you want quick regular fast updates then this plugin is not for you. Though of corse as it is LackeyCCG you can add your own packs yourself witrh ease.

So I got sent a image from the iPad version....

image1.jpg [http://s28.postimg.org/ybdn5i13d/image1.jpg] [http://s28.postimg.org/mz11npsej/image1.png]

As you can see there is a lot of room taken up with buttons, what with the iPad being so much smaller. These are accessible from the right click menu on the cards, or the keybindings on computer.

Would you guys like me to remove a ton of those buttons.. all those +1 / -1 Token buttons?

If I understand you, then I would prefer to keep the +/- buttons, that are currently in the middle of the screen... if the alternative is flicking between 'touch does: left/middle/right ' more, like every time I wish to add or subtract a resource, progress or wound counter?

 

However abbreviations or smaller icons/colours to reduce the amount of space they took up would be great :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

yeah, I'll reduce them all to just the first letter... T- / T+ for threat + and Threat - ... stuff like that? I'll update soon and you can tell me if the buttons are to small, we can work out what the best size for easy of use is.

Hi. Could you also maybe add a way to flip cards in the iPad version? Normally you would use ctrl on the laptop but that doesn't seem to be possible here. Same goes for the Space Hulk plugin. No way to turn the cards. Or do you have a smart move up your sleeves? :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

If you were wanting to 'flip' say a shadow card over? Then choose the "touch does: right click" at the bottom of the screen, then  touch the shadow card in question and then select 'flip' or 'flip card' from the list of options that popup.

I am not sure how it works... as far as I know when you drag the card a button is suposed to pop up and you clikc it to flip before yuou drop. I can add a "flip card" button to the button menu as well in the next update that should be coming soon.

As I said I do not have a iPad... dose it have a video recorder? Be cool if somone could show me the iPad in action. I do not know a single person who owns one.

Hmm, I don't seem to have this option in my version. I've checked with shadow and quest cards, I'm definitely up to date.

To be honest the interface is not good for a touchscreen device, hopefully it will be improved.

Sorry Tragic, I don't have any idea how to record video on this thing!

Lord of the Ring: The Card Game






- LackeyCCG Plugin Version 7.1 -











So LackeyCCG is finally out for iPad!! Woot-a-loot-a-lot. You can now use lackeyCCG to play on Mac,PC, Linux and iPad, iPhone vs any users on any of the other platforms!

Just a note, I do not own a iPad (android forever, *******!) So if you are having problems with the iPad version the place to ask is the LackeyCCG forums.
 


Lord of the Rings: The Card Game (LCG) - LackeyCCG Plugin Version 7 [http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9169569/LackeyCCG/LoTR-LCG/updatelist.txt]
Have Fun and ROLL HIGH
Tragic
 






IF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS TRY COMPLETELY REMOVING THE OLD PLUGIN FOLDER AND REINSTALL IT




Fixed

- Travel Announcement Voice now says the correct phase
- Now each general token is 100% unique. (Changed 2nd green token to pink)

Changed

- Removed "Hover" Button. I do not think anyone uses it.
- All buttons have been abbreviated to Initials to save screen space for iPad versions. This may make the WIN/MAC/Linux version a little harder to use. Remember there are keybindsings.
 


If people want the "full buttons" back.. I'll make a new download URL for ipad and one for PC that has the full buttons.




 
Abbreviations

Top Button Bar

RA = Refersh All / Threat +1 / Draw 1 Card (F1)
D = Draw 1 Card (F2)
DE = Draw Encounter (F5)
DS = Draw Shadow (F6)
DQ = Draw Quest (F4)
DE2 = Draw from 2nd Encounter Deck (F7)
DS2 = Draw Shadow from 2nd Encounter Deck (F8)
TC = Take control of card (alt+t)

Tokens

R+ = Add Resource
R- = Subtract Resource

W+ = Add Wound
W- = Subtract Wound

T+ = Add Travel Token
T- = Subtract Travel Token

O+ = Add Orange Token
O- = Subtract Orange Token

R+ = Add Red Token
R- = Subtract Red Token

I+ = Add Indigo Token
I- = Subtract Indigo Token

Now there is so much room I could add buttons for the other three general tokens. I haven't yet as I want to get feedback form the iPad users as I do not have a iPad so I can not tell how much space has been freed up. For now you can access the tokens via the keyboard shortcuts or right clicking on the card.

Canned Button (lower bar)

T+ = Add Threat
T- = Subtract Threat
R = Refersh All / Threat +1 / Draw 1 Card (I know this is doubled up, forget about that!)
S1 = Save 1
L1 = Load 1
D6 = Draw 6
M = Mulligan
C = Choose Start Player
P5 = Peak 5 (Look at top 5 of your own deck)
P3 = Peak 3
P1 = Peak 1
S1 = Scry 1 (Look at top card of Encounter Deck 1)
S2 = Scry 2
S3 = Scry 3
S2 = Save 2
L2 = Load 2
S3 = Save 3
L3 = Load 3
S4 = Save 4
L4 = Load 4


Keyboard Functions

You can set your own keyboard functions to anything you wish, by clicking PREFERENCES button and then clicking KEYBINDINGS. These are just what I use. Feel free to change ANY button but the F!! and the F12.. if you change these you will break some of the scripting functions. Remember you can always update form the url at any time to reset everything to defaults.

Keybindings in Lackey are pervasive across the application, so if you use "t" for take control, then every time you type "t" in the chat window it will trigger the hotkey. So I am using SHIFT+T and CTRL+T to turn On and Off tokens. There is a bug in LackeyCCG at the moment that makes windows systems beep if you use ALT+t.... so for now it is SHIFT+T.. but will go back to ALT once the bug is fixed.

CRT+LEFT CLICK = Flip a Card
HOLD SHIFT + MOUSE OVER (Peak at the other side of the card without flipping it)

F1 = Refresh ALL
F2 = Draw Card

] = Next Phase (auto save each advanced phase)
[ = Last Phase
F4 = Advance Turn

F3 = Draw Quest Card
F5 = Draw Encounter Card
F6 = Draw Shadow Card
F7 = Draw 2nd Encounter Card
F8 = Draw 2nd Shadow Card

F12 = Empty Hand - This moves the top card of your hand to the top of your draw deck. (do not change this keybinding!!)

SHIFT+T = Take Control of Card

SHIFT+Q / CRT+Q = Resource Token (Add / Remove)
SHIFT+W / CRT+W = Wound Token (Add / Remove)
SHIFT+E / CRT+E = Quest Token (Add / Remove)

SHIFT+A / CRT+A = Yellow Generic Token (Add / Remove)
SHIFT+S / CRT+S = Red Generic Token (Add / Remove)
SHIFT+D / CRT+D = Purple Generic Token (Add / Remove)

SHIFT+Z / CRT+Z = Blue Generic Token (Add / Remove)
SHIFT+X / CRT+X = Cross Generic Token (Add / Remove)
SHIFT+C / CRT+C = Green Generic Token (Add / Remove)

CTRL+1 = Toggle Draw Mode ON / OFF
CTRL+2 = Clear Drawn Markings

SHIFT+R = Roll 6 sided Dice
SHIFT+F = Flip Coin

For the record I change the hotkeys so they do not use the SHIFT modifiers, as I always use a voice communication and never use the chat window anyway.


There is are some helpful BUTTONS near the chat window.

SAVE - Save the current state of the game
LOAD - Load saved game
DRAW 6 - Shuffle your deck, then draw 6 Cards, then announce in chat you are drawing your star hand
Mulligan - Announce a Mulligan, then discard hand, shuffle deck, draw 6 cards
Choose - Picks a random player as 1st player
Scry # - Peak at the top cards of encounter deck 1
Peak # - Peak at the top cards of your player deck

Refresh - This is hotkeyed for Mac and Pc users to F1 by default, but iPad users... use this button to refresh. It will also raise your threat +1 and draw a new card in a single action.

Useful Console Commands

Remember lackeyCCG has a huge list of console commands to let you do awesome stuff... see the full list at lackeyccg.com [http://www.lackeyccg.com/tutoriallogcommands.html]! Though here are some real useful ones!

/save NameYouChoose (Save the current game, includes all decks)
/load NameYouChoose (Load a save game)
/senddeck # (This command will send you deck to the other player and download it directly to their deck folder, replace the # with their seat number.. so if their name is 3rd in the list it would be "/senddeck 3"


Some Tips

You need to set up a player profile to play online.

In "MISC" and untick "Show ToolTips"
In "MISC" tick "Auto remove tokens"
In "MISC" you can set lackey to "one mouse button mode"

In PERFORMANCE set it to "HIGH"

In "APPEARANCE" untick "Make Card viewer image pop out" (if you like some like it ticked)
In "APPEARANCE" Adjust "Counter Size" to make the counters bigger or smaller on the cards

Have Fun and ROLL HIGH

What a nice way to ask...

Don't mind him Tragic. I play both versions and nothing I ruined. Yes, it is a little more challenging to begin with, but after 5 min you get used to it. If ever you get the time and feel like it I can see how it would be perfect with both an iPad and a desktop version. But if it would result in longer time between the updates it is perfectly fine the way it is. Thank you for using your spare time to do this.

Hi, I'm a long-time OCTGN user, trying to get back into LackeyCCG because of OCGTN's lack of a Save feature. 

 

I am having a problem setting up some filters in the deck editor.  So here's my question:

 

I currently play 2-handed solo, and am proceeding linearly through the quests, allowing myself to use any cards which were available at the time the quests were released.  So, for the first Khazad Dum quest, I'm allowing myself any player cards from the Core Set, the Mirkwood cycle, and the Khazad Dum expansion.  Easy peasy, right?  Well, the challenge (for me) is getting those filters set up.

 

Specifically, I would like a filter which shows me only cards which are:

 

- set: Core set OR Mirkwood cycle OR Khazad Dum

- type: player cards only (hero OR ally OR attachment OR event OR)

- sphere: leadership OR lore OR neutral

 

I would love to be able to save that filter, which I can do with OCTGN (as a subscriber).

 

I would also love to have a second filter, for the other hand.  The only change is the sphere:

 

- sphere: tactics OR spirit OR neutral

 

 

So, is there a way in LackeyCCG to set up those 2 filters, and then save them, so that I don't have to manually set them up again each time I want to edit a deck?

 

Thanks!

Yes, I will be updating the LackeyCCG plugin soon... as well as releasing two versions.. one for iPad with the abbreviated buttons and one for desktops with the longer button names. Just as soon as I get some time!
 

> So, is there a way in LackeyCCG to set up those 2 filters, and then save them, so that I don't have to manually set them up again each time I want to edit a deck?


In the LackeyCCG Deck Editor on the left is a massive series of filter buttons. To filter by set simply click the "SET" button.. I think it is the 2nd button on the list and type in CORE or w/e and only CORE cards will be seen.

Unfortunately you can not add multiple filters. So you can not filter CORE + RTM as far as I know.

Your best bet is to use Zorbec's Awesome Deckbuilder. It is a must IMO for LoTR Fans and beats the hell out of all the online things. It has export for Lackey built in and also OCTGN (but I do not use OCTGN so haven't tested it)

Oho, excellent! I for one really look forward to seeing it: despite my respect for its community importance, I'm not really a fan of OCTGN (how many times can its crashes sabotage my solo 2-handed plays?!), and I can only build so many crappy attempts at an Erestor deck in real life before longing for a way to do, and test, it digitally. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Lackey is better than OCTGN in absolutely every conceivable way. It is a blight on the online scene that somehow that app become the standard.

 

Unfortunately I just do not have time to keep the LoTR plugin updated... so unless someone wants to take it over I'll just update it now and then.

UPDATE
 
Finally found what I think could be a replacement host for DropBox... 5GBfree.com.
 
I have uploaded the lackeyCCG Plugin to this server as well as incorporated some slight changes.
 
• ADDED : Cycle 04

 

• Voice of Isengard (Delux)

• The Ring Maker Cycle

 
• CHANGED : New Keybindings
• CHANGED : Removed the Truncated Button Names
 
Apart from that it is pretty much the same as it ever was.

NOTE
 
I do not really play this game much anymore. This plugin will probably not get another update.. unless I get help from another. The truth is that I have moved most of my play into TableTop Simulator. There is also OCTGN.
 
The big plus of LackeyCCG over OCTGN was that it was that it also had iOS support.
 
If you wish to help
 
If you wish to help with this plugin then PM me on this forum and speak up.. all I really need is someone to enter the data into the cardtext file, as I hate doing that. I can then produce all the cards needs and get the plugin updated on the server.

It would be awesome is someone who has the lotrlcg plugin folder could upload and share it on Dropbox or something. I think that's all you need to get it working. I lost it about a week ago when I had to reinstall windows. I've been using OCTGN since but I much prefer TTB's plugin for LackeyCCG instead.

Ok.. I think I have found a solution to this problem....

If anyone is interested I spent the last few weeks updating the card database all the way up to and including The Black Serpent, scanning a lot of my own cards in the process. I also went ahead and created all the encounter decks for normal mode. They can be found in the deck folder. I then compressed the whole LackeyCCG folder containing everything to a zip file which can be downloaded below. After downloading it just unzip it and play! I'm not taking over ownership of the plugin or anything like that, nor will I be posting updates.

This is all sorts of amazing! I've often considered doing the same thing, but the sheer amount of busywork involved in doing it always put me off. I am really grateful you did this!

Seriously, this is great! I started to work on updating this once, but got kind of overwhelmed. Thanks!

Now I just need to figure out how to make the plugin so I can play it on my iPad again... :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I just want you to know that it is really appreciated. Thank you for your efforts.
OCTGN is amazing, but I need the save functionality Lackey provides, so this is a life saver for me!

Added encounter and player cards for "The Dungeons of Cirith Gurat" and "The Mountain of Fire". Also included are the properly formatted image files for OCTGN. Follow the README instructions included.

Looks like GITHUB has screwed up... 

 

Does anyone have a version of my plug with all the images downloaded? I am missing files.

 

I am planning to host a RAR file you just download.
