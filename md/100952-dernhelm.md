I would never make or use a home-brew card in the game, and I would be slow to make suggestions to the designers, or share some wilder "thought-designs" of my own with the community any more. But the other night I was thinking of Éowyn and her card. Of course she can, and probably will, get a new version with different stats, but this one idea, though mine, seems quite neat.

 

Dernhelm

Tactics Attachment, cost 1, unique

 

Attach to Éowyn.

Éowyn gains the Tactics icon.

Planning Action: Exhaust Dernhelm to give Éowyn -3 willpower and +3 attack until the end of the round.

I support this idea 100%. Give more love to Eowyn :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
