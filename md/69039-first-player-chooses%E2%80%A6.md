 With the cards Dol Guldur Orcs,

The first player chooses 1 character currently committed to the quest. Deal 2 damage to that character.

And Black Uruks,

The first player must choose and discard an attachment from a questing character, if able.

Does the character have to belong to the first player? Or is it a character belonging to any player? I guess a literal reading means its any character but I just wanted to make sure.

Many thanks.

Ben

 It's any character.
