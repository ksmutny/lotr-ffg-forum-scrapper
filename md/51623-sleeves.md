Finally getting around to sleeving my cards.  I picked up many packs of FF's Standard sized sleeves.  The grey ones. Is it just me or do these seem slightly oversized?  There is plenty of room around the card, and the top sticks out about 1/4 inch past the card.  Dont get me wrong, the sleeves are amazing.  They look tough as nails.

I've used Ultra Pro in the past, and the fit is snugger, but I've had them split sometimes. 

What do you all use?

I'm using FFG's sleeves. Perhaps they are a bit big but I've never used any others so I can't really compare. I'm very pleased with them after 4 months

I switched from Ultra Pro penny sleeves to the same FFG standard size card game sleeves that it sounds like you're using, and I've had no complaints.  I thought the cheaper sleeves I switched from had far more "extra," unoccupied plastic sticking up at the top than the FFG ones do, so I'm glad I made the change.  They feel comfortable, durable, and I'm not left feeling like there's a bunch of loose, bendable plastic sticking out beyond the top of the card.  At least, not an amount that is very noticeable to me.

 I switched to FFG's sleeves because they fit more snugly, but my local gaming store never has many in stock. Sleeving my cards at the rate they have them available means the game will be discontinued before I'm done :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

I also can't find many FFG sleeves at CCG Armory, which is the preferable place now (best shipping costs, reasonable speed). I prefer having a lot of coloured sleeves, rather than art sleeves, but it seems I'll have to resort to those. Ultra Pro sleeves are both too tall and too wide - FFG sleeves are a little narrower. At least the coloured ones I've bought so far.

I'd love to know a good type of sleeve to get for the scenario cards also! Something as durable as the art sleeves, but transparent. I have about 2000 generic Ultra Pro sleeves I use while looking for proper ones, and they feel like socks where the rubber band tore :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I use MayDay games sleeves (Maydaygames.com) - which you can get in the UK via boardgameextras.co.uk

Still using the penny / cheap sleeves, but I'll probably switch to the official LotR ones if they can start selling them.

I did buy one set of FFG Standard (transparent) sleeves and use them on the quest cards since opaque sleeves won't do on those. Very satisfied with the sleeves until now.

My usual haunts have a lack of the silver labeled ones. I sleeve all of mine as soon as I get an expansion. Although I currently don't have my Carrock encounter deck sleeved yet because of said shortage.

This is my first game I've ever used sleeves for, and I have to say I like them a lot. Pretty easy to shuffle too.

Sounds like most people use the FFG ones.  I've tried the mayday sleeves on my Descent cards, and they fit extremely well.  I used the cheaper mayday ones though, I believe.  They fit better, but dont seem as durable.  It seems like a trade off.  Though I suppose I could try the Mayday ones, I'm not sure I want to take the chance on them having just spent $20 on the FFG sleeves.  But then again, if I continue to sleeve all the cards it could save money in the long run... gr.  You get my condundrum.

Another question: do you guys sleeve all the cards?  Or just the ones you use at the time?  Sleeving all of them could get extremely expensive. Especially if you use the designer sleeve FFG is putting out soon... and changing them out would get annoying.

 I have all of my LOTR cards in sleeves, but then again I'm also a person that bought three Core Sets.

Back when I played Magic as a teen, I only sleeved the cards I actually played with in my decks, but that may have had more to do with overwhelming numbers of cards and huge numbers of duplicates, etc, which so far definitely isn't a problem with this game.

Bookmarked!

I sleeve all my decks, at the very least. For all the LCGs I have prepared decks, and for this game there are even more cards in constant use. I'd use the art sleeves when they arrive, because even though they are pricier than some regular sleeves, I still pay 50% more for regular sleeves from my local gaming store than at CCG Armory or Sci-fi Genre. Board Game Extras seem to follow American prices too. Shipping is even friendlier from the UK if they deliver here.

I always toss in some sleeves when ordering cards and games from those places, making the cost insignificant. Let's not talk about my 2000+ sleeve collection of Ultra Pros, though :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I've got corrugated BCW boxes (the ones that fit 800 cards) for my older LCGs. All the unused (at this moment!) cards go there, without sleeves. When I build decks I pick the cards I need, put sleeves on them and stick them in plastic Ultra Pro deckboxes. Usually colour-coded, depending on availability at the ULGS.

Speaking of deck boxes, I'd rather have a few of those in LOTR style than sleeves at this point. Since I've got so many clear sleeves, which yes I sleeve all of them, it would suck to have to unsleeve each one. My set is used by my friends when they come over for game night too.
