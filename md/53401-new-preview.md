Some Eagle love and some location hate!  Looking forward to seeing more of this one.

Love Descendant of Thorondor! Looks like they are slowly pushing out more and more eagles. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Each one of these packs seems to be unique enough to hook players and get us excited. Good sign.

Might actually get to the point where Gandalf doesn't fit in your 50-card deck. Too many other goodies crammed in it.

life without 3 gandalfs? never! haha, seriously though i think theyll be a time when just one is in there

 I was already toying with a creature deck with Radagast and tactics heroes. This will make it even more viable and less of a "flavor" deck that I play for the fun of it. Adding this might also make The Eagles are Coming worth putting into a deck.

I hope for that 1 day. Other wise all the decks mostly same.

 It sounds like the release date is set to be the 22nd.  That means I might be going on a new quest this weekend. aplauso.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/aplauso.gif]

Not really sure about the 22nd September mark... I understood that the 22nd is just the birthday of 2 Baggins and FFG asked for some nice hobbit-themed deck builds.

## 10 [gatharion on September 20, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53401-new-preview/?do=findComment&comment=530568)

I've been loving the Eagles, still trying to find just the right combination of heroes to go with Radaghast and all the Eagles. Right now I'm working with Bilbo, Thalin, and Legolas.

Are we getting a new Hero in this set? I assume so, but I don't recall seeing anything about it..

I've been trying to make three player decks out of a single core set and the expansions, so just one Gandalf per deck is how I've been rolling.

It does read that way, but I'm still crossing my fingers that the AP will be released as a birthday present to the hobbits.  Maybe Samwise Gamgee will be the new hero.  I know it's not likely, but it's still fun to think about.

## 12 [Vyron2 on September 20, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53401-new-preview/?do=findComment&comment=530807)

 cool! Samwise... but he would have to be very weak, no? I mean.... it's Sam :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

it's gonna be non-dwarf in any case... and probably non-hobbit - as we have already two? idk.....

but awesome cards! this really is a good sign! way to go FFG!

Indeed :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]. And oh boy if it is Sam finally!

I think having 1 copy of Gandalf has no meaning, unless there are three copies of a card who can search for him. I am looking forward to more search cards, although there have already been three in the first expansion.

ps: I am playing a deck with three copies of Radagast and no copies of Gandalf.

I could've sworn there was a preview showing Boromir...

## 16 [Narsil0420 on September 21, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53401-new-preview/?do=findComment&comment=530949)

Boromir is in the Dead Marshes Expansion

## 17 [Mighty Jim 83 on September 21, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53401-new-preview/?do=findComment&comment=530962)

so far, we've had two Hobbits and a man.

We've got another man coming in pack 5, and lots of Dwarves at Christmas (or whenever Kazad-Dum appears)

Time for another Elf? - how about Elladan or Elrohir?

I agree, probably an Elf for this pack and then I'm guessing for the sixth and final adventure pack of the cycle its going to be Gwaihir (I think someone earlier in the thread guessed at him as a hero at some point).  Would make sense given how there is a very strong Eagle theme going on with the Shadows of Mirkwood cycle!

Yes true. 1 year ago i sow demo card of Celeborn elf spirit hero. So i think he is coming now. But maybe can be Thorin also was a demo card before.

Gwaihir as a hero is amazing!!!! Will be really coll if happen!!!!!

## 20 [lleimmoen on September 21, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53401-new-preview/?do=findComment&comment=531099)

My guess is that Gwaihir will be a unique ally for the last expansion. Cannot see him as a hero. And I hope we shall get a cheap eagle in Dead Marshes because Gwaihir will be expensive. All guesses though.

## 21 [DurinIII on September 21, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53401-new-preview/?do=findComment&comment=531100)

 I agree...we need another cheap eagle! Even if it is a 1 resource chump block eagle (which is really awesome actually).

Only 2 dwarves at Christmas.

Wouldn't mind seeing another elf hero in Return to Mirkwood, though.

## 23 [player2090081 on September 21, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53401-new-preview/?do=findComment&comment=531261)

How about Celebron

Cost - 13   Will - 2   Strength - 3   Vitality - 4

Spirit

Text: Discard an Ally to reduce Threat level by 3 (once per Round)

OR

Text: Discard an Attachment attached to Hero to reduce Threat level by 2 (once per Round)

## 24 [radiskull on September 21, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53401-new-preview/?do=findComment&comment=531264)

 That seems VERY powerful, but for 13 threat, that might be possible.  Were you thinking Defense 2?

## 25 [richsabre on September 22, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53401-new-preview/?do=findComment&comment=531498)

think elrond will appear, but perhaps in a later cycle, perhaps a lone lands/ trollshaws/ angmar cycle, and  im guessing he will be very powerful, such as

 

Elrond - Leadership

 

Threat cost- 13

Willpower- 3

Attack- 3

Defense- 3

Hit points- 4

 

Ability- discard a card from your hand to give all characters +1 willpower until the end of the turn

He'd probably fit better as a Lore Hero.

## 27 [lleimmoen on September 23, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53401-new-preview/?do=findComment&comment=532121)

The way it works so far (as it seems to me) is that cheaper heroes come off more powerful. It would be a waste to have a hero with 3 Will, 3 Attack, 3 Defense. The ability is mostly what makes them tick, plus one good stat. Théodred is a great hero even though he always quests for one (unless boosted).

As for the preview, I find Descendant of Thorondor just amazing. The best eagle so far and my vote for the best generic ally so far (tied with Northern Tracker).

It will be an excellent addition to tactics decks everywhere.

I'm kind of hoping to see Eomer as one of the two remaining Heroes for the Mirkwood cycle.  I wouldn't mind if he was a tactics hero either.

## 29 [lleimmoen on September 23, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53401-new-preview/?do=findComment&comment=532292)

Gondor will have gotten all sphere heroes by Dead Marshes. I can see Rohan extending to Tactics surely, especially as Spirit-Tactics is a combo much suggested. I do not think we will see a Lore Rohan hero (or even ally) any time soon. And I really hope the two remaining heroes in the cycle are Elves.
