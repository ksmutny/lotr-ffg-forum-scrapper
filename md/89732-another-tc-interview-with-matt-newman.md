I knew Team Covenant had nice player cards spoiler videos, and now they've got some good quality interview videos too.

 

I think everyone called out that Steward's Fear was intended to be a place new players can jump into, good to see that being confirmed; I personally am too lazy for sophisticated deck building and hope for more of these kinds of keyword development, but not too often as it will feel like we are being spoonfed (although that may be true)... maybe every other Cycle or every third Cycle.

 

Also now I want Stone of Erech even more.

Hopefully they continue this kind of shift in difficulty (starts relativly easier and gets hellish after half dozen turns) which I think is true because of the Time X keywords we are going to get next Cycle.
