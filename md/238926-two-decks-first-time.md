I've played the game for a while now but have never used two decks. When using two decks, I have to abide by the "Per Player" rule, yes?

Why wouldn't you?

Eh, it's possible to assume that there's technically only one "player"; but two-handed solo, you're simulating a second player. So yes. Play as if you've cloned yourself and two separate human beings are manipulating two separate decks of cards :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Playing two-handed is fun, even if it takes a while to get used to it if you've been playing true solo.
