Played Hunt for Gollum nightmare the other day and I called on this bad boy to help us out. I decided to remove a Hunter from Mordor, who had a clue card attached (there were 3 clue cards in play at this point so the hunters were really annoying). During staging, another Hunter from Mordor gets revealed and we got to discussing wether or not the clue card attached to the first Hunter from Mordor is also considered to be out-of-play?

 

We both leaned towards that when you remove a card from play (or consider it to be out-of-play) then the same goes for any attachments on those cards. Much like when a card leaves play from natural causes (gets explored or killed) it also affects all the attachments on that card. So that is how we played it.

 

The wording though: the chosen enemy or location is considered to be out of play, kinda bothers me. It seems to suggest that it might only be the chosen card and not it´s attachments.

So even though we did get to the consensus that attachments are also out-of-play it still has been nagging at the back of my mind.

Anyone have some thoughts on this.

from the first view attachments will be removed with a card what he attach.....but there is can be some other solutions... if hero remove from the game all attachments in him is discarded. so Clues should back to the staging area..... good question... we need a Caleb answer

Well, if the guard of the clue card is out of play, it isn't guarded anymore. In your case the Hunter was attached to the clue card and not the other way around. So IMO the clue card looses it's attachment is is stiill in play and free available. However, what is going to happen once the Hunter returns? Is he going to return as an attachment or not? (My guess is that he won't)

 

Otherwise I tend to agree with Glaurung. If the clue card was attached to the Hunter, it should also go back to the staging area.

And attachments of Nazguls, in Black Riders? Do they discard?

You know, I think a guarded objective will just have to become unattached in this scenario.  Look at the manual text:

"An encounter card

attached to a guarded objective is dealt with in the
following method, depending on its card type:
Enemy: The enemy leaves play, either by being
defeated or as the result of a card effect.
Location: The location leaves play, either by being
fully explored or as the result of a card effect."
 
The enemy (or location) has  "left play" as "the result of a card effect."  ...right?
 
For the Nazgul attachments, I guess they get discarded?  I think official clarification would be nice here...

Think you got it right grandspleen.

With your rule book quote there's no need for a official ruling imo.

The clue is a objective card, and the other is a treachery.

That's the difference.

Crystal clear I say.
