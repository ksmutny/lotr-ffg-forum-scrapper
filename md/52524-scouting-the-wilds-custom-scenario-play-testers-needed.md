Here is my first custom scenario, Scouting the wilds- i need some play testers, so any feedback would be helpful

It is aimed at levels 2-3, uses the core set, and is designed to be played solo. At the moment i am still trying to get the 'you cannot pass this stage until...' balanced, so i need some help with that.
