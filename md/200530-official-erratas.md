# [Official erratas?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/200530-official-erratas/)

As the title says, does anyone know which are the official erratas to this game, or where can I find them? I know for example that Will of the West has an errata that doesn't appear on the card text... I wonder which other cards or rules have received erratas

 

Thanks in advance!

Bear in mind there is a new version coming soon apparently.
