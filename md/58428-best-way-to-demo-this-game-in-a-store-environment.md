I am looking to spend some time doing live action demonstrations of LOTR and COC LCG's. Anyone have any suggestions on the best way to do a 15-20 minute demonstration that gives the basics?

may sound obvious but what about the passage through mirkwood...that is sort of a beginners basic scenario anyways, though i would take out the forest spider and old forest road at the set up, also do you have access to adventure packs- you could give a quick overview to show how the game grows as a CCG/LCG
