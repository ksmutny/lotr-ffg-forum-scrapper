"Action: Discard 2 resources from your hero's resource pool to add 3 resources to that hero's resource pool. " what does it mean? You actually get one extra resource? Discard 2..get 3...3-2 =1 ?

My guess is that it adds a single resource to a hero, but only if they already have at least 2. Hence you need to discard 2 first. If you can't do that, then you don't get to play the card.

Yep. It's a restriction on playing the card. It gives you a resource, but the hero must already have two resources to play it. They could also have made it a 2-cost event that said ``"Action: Gain three resources".

 Every card that make gain resource have a condition. Doomed with legacy of numenor, trait for the vast majority of them and here you have to already have 2 resource to gain another one. You have to wait or to use it in combo with other cards. That an important part of the balanced of this card. The way you write it you can always win the third resource AND move resource from a hero to another with this effect. It would be really more powerful.
