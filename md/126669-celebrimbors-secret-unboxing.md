As a Noldor/Silvan player, this pack leaves me speechless. Might be the best one to date! Cloak of Lorien and Mirror of Galadriel are insane. Hopefully no more slapping a Gondorian shield on Elrohir!

Great pack. Orokin is awesome, that tactics ally with optional doom is really good and handmaiden is both a cutiepie and a very solid silvan ally (new staple perhaps?).

I'm excited for this pack. All allies are fantastic as well as the events and attachments. I really want to try Heir of Mardil, although it's useless for Tactics Boromir, that is the version I use in my Gondor deck. Still, seems good in a general purpose. Also Spirit Silvan is now a thing. This could be my favorite pack to date actually... the only thing I don't like is the Cloak, too restrictive, don't like it. I like that the developers are interacting with location keywords, but they're doing it wrong. There's so much diversity in terms of location types in each scenario that if they decided to make general use cards they should group different traits together, and the card says that it works in a "forest, hills, barrow" or "underground, dark, mountain". That'd be a lot more viable.

I agree about your concerns on the cloack but it's very likely that the designers are aware of them and we see a card effect that applies the forest trait to the active location.

I like 'em all as well.  Regarding the cloak, I think 1 resource for 1 defense is very fair (Dunedain Warning is the same thing, and it still makes its way into my non-tactics decks sometimes).  The 2 defense for a Forest location is just gravy, I wouldn't judge the card as a "+2 or nothing" card.  

## 14 [FetaCheese on November 9, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126669-celebrimbors-secret-unboxing/?do=findComment&comment=1327263)

Now I really want to make a thematic deck that revolves around Denethor.  You can give him Steward of Gondor, Heir of Mardil, Gondorian Shield, and Palantir.  Use the Palantir during planning, then SoG to ready him.  5 defense with access to burning brand and use wealth of Gondor for a free readying effect.  The new ally could give him 7 defense and sentinel with multiple readies between SoG, wealth of Gondor, and behind strong walls.  Or even without Palantir you can use his ability then use SoG to ready him.

Goddamn AMAZING player cards.

Orophin is an auto include in my decks and I'm already looking at making space for Henneth Annen Guard, Galadriel's Handmaiden and Cloak of Lorien.

So thematic and amazing art on all of them. Really enjoyed Matt and Caleb (and team Covenents) banter and discussion of the cards. Can't wait to see the encounter cards as well.

This looks like one of the most powerful group of player cards ever released! That elven cloak combined with Elven Mail will be able to buff up Gildor or ally Haldir to crazy stats!

The lore loving part of me hates this but I'm gonna be keeping Shield but also including the Cloak and buffing him up to insane levels :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

As is I pretty regularly get him to 7 or 8 defense with Gondorian Shield and Steward, Arwen's Buff and a Dunedain Warning or two. With the Cloak as well now he can get up to 8 or 9 or even 10 if I'm in a forest!!!!

I'm not sure if any hero can rival his potential now!

Plus like the Warning it isn't restricted either so you can still put other defensive items like Gondorian Shield, Citadel Plate, Elven Mail etc on them.

the silvan stuff seems very good.  1 cost for the cloak seems more than fair to me.  Seems like a card to run if you have a lot of Silvan or Noldor.

So,   Heir of Mardil + Blue Mountain trader = ready my hero forever, correct?   This seems broken.

Not loving Charge of the Rohirrim,  and it's because I play a lot of Rohan.   The thing is,  if you're running Rohan and you're running Tactics,  you've almost certainly got Eomer and Firefoot already,  rarely do you need +3 more attack.   While it can be funny to bump Eomer up to just ridiculous levels,  the attack power is simply not needed very often.    On the other hand,  the idea of giving Steed of the Mark to Eowyn and have her quest, ready, and just charge in and destroy something is quite appealing.

Never fear! You need to exhaust Heir of Mardil. 1 time use.

Please, read the text of Heir of Mardil once again before posting something like this.

 

Speaking of Heir of Mardil, a perfect fir for it would be Theodred.

 

And speaking of two would-be abominations of this pack - this Elven Cloak and Galadriels Mirror.

 

While I really hate stuff like this - this elven cloak gives a lot of room outside the forest locations. It costs 1, it's not restricted, and it gives 1 def, so it's sorta comparable to the dunedain thingy. I would let that one slide for now.

 

But... Galadriel's Mirror. Attaching to a name. Never. NEVER EXCUSE.

While it's a bit of a setup: Haldir + Nor Am I A Stranger + mount (pick of 4 for him, including Asfaloth), + Charge of the Rohirrim. Probably best paired with a Rohan deck, but still a combination I'd like to see happen.

I'm not a fan of Charge of Rohirrim either. It takes a tremendous setup to be effective, it's restricted in trait, it costs a lot AND it'll be rarely needed.

## 27 [Scroll Lock on November 9, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126669-celebrimbors-secret-unboxing/?do=findComment&comment=1327679)

I think charge of the rohhirim is amazing late game thing. In the last rounds of quest where you have to destroy everything, this card may bring amazing combo with Forth Eorlingas and what I love about it is the fact, it gives life to a bad card- Steed pf the Mark.

Orophin seems very powerful, auto include for silvan decks which often use the "discard x cards from your deck" (bad luck if you discard orophin :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png])

Only thing that disappoints me: we did not get a 4-5 cost big ally for spirit again. I wanted to see this in this cycle... hopefully, it will happen in the last pack

## 28 [awp832 on November 9, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126669-celebrimbors-secret-unboxing/?do=findComment&comment=1327688)

I've not been able to use Forth Eorlingas effectively... ever.  And I have tried.   If we want this combo we have to pay another 2 tactics.   It's too much.

## 29 [Crabble on November 9, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126669-celebrimbors-secret-unboxing/?do=findComment&comment=1327703)

> I've not been able to use Forth Eorlingas effectively... ever.  And I have tried.   If we want this combo we have to pay another 2 tactics.   It's too much.

 

I agree. To make this combo good you need some setup time to get out other attachments like the mounts and if you want to use Forth Eorlingas effectivly you need the enemys in the staging area which is unlikely to happen later in the game. And 4 ressources just to mow down the staging area with still maybe 2 enemys left in play down in some players attacking zone... I don't think thats worth it. I like the idea behind the card but I highly doubt that you could set up a massiv attack to the staging area regulary in a game.

Other more likely way for 4 ressources to spend could be to Hammerstroke every enemy to your side of the table, defend with Boromir multiple times (+ some chump blocking) and then use Charge of the Rohirim for a wipe out.

## 30 [Scroll Lock on November 9, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126669-celebrimbors-secret-unboxing/?do=findComment&comment=1327706)

I said you CAN use it with Forth E, not have to. This card is pretty good alone, too. You say that playing mounts is too long setup for such card. Easy solution: play it in a deck where you would play mounts even without this card. It is not a setup, you would play mounts no matter what. I like this card a lot and I am sure it can help in many rohan decks. It is not a card you want to build a deck around. It is a card you add to a deck and when you see it, big things will happen. With more and more mounts coming, this card will get beter and better. I will definitely give it a chance.

## 31 [Scroll Lock on November 9, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126669-celebrimbors-secret-unboxing/?do=findComment&comment=1327707)

Yes, hammerstroke is another good combo with this card.

I guess it's more of a multiplayer card. One player plays Spirit Rohan, another Tactics Rohan, and the third one runs Leadershit Gondor with Mutual Accord.

What a great pack.

I like all the cards in it. They're all playable and usefull.

Granted, some more then others, but there's not a single coaster in it.

And that's how I like my packs: coasterless.

I just realised that Mirror of Galadriel discards RANDOM card from your hand. Very interesting card.

## 35 [monkeyrama on November 9, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126669-celebrimbors-secret-unboxing/?do=findComment&comment=1327783)

Mirror of Galadriel sounded much more fun until I hit that line. Still a good card, but the random discard could be a bummer. 

 

The Heir card is cool, sad it won't work on Mablung unless we take him on campaign. But it's very nice all the same. Cool effects.

 

And Silvan now looks like a very solid trait to work with. Seems like a good pack, offering thematic alternatives to some old problems, and some cool new readying effects that open up new possibilities. Now the obligatory wait in the UK for it (only just got Nin...)

## 36 [Djenni on November 9, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126669-celebrimbors-secret-unboxing/?do=findComment&comment=1327786)

Too bad Galadrim Minstrel feels so insignificant compared to other "entering play and doing somthing" sivlans that entered play this cycle :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

While two cards of the pack being a glue cards for Galadriel is a sad thing, it gives me a small beam of hope that Saruman is being a future AP hero, because he'll need some glue for sure.

 

Now, lets round up what we know about the last pack:

 

Hero:

???

 

Leadershit:

???

???

 

Lore:

???

???

 

Spirit:

That "trample" event when you damage someone by questing.

???

 

Tactics:

Booming Ent

Captain of Gondor

 

Neutral:

Treebeard

 

That's lesser half of the pack already revealed. Good, something new to see.

Figure i'll put my two cents in on the previously unspoiled cards as well:

 

Heir of Mardil-an interesting card that i think makes a nice addition to the cardpool.  has enough restrictions that i dont think makes it OP like unexpected courage between the noble requirement and even with the ever present steward of gondor there is a bit of a tradeoff that to take advantage of the readying effect you wouldnt be able to use the resources from steward until after the planning phase.  As Trolo mentioned Theodred makes a phenomenal pair for this card and I'll be looking forward to seeing how he pairs with some other leadership rohan support that i anticipate or at the very least hopes comes in the form of our final hero and in the treason of isengard saga expansion. Gandalf with another noble hero would also go well with this since his staff is another form of repeatable resource addition.  I think it will also pair well with horn of gondor if you have a definitive plan to chump block and i can see some shenanigans with Miruvor as well.

 

Orophin-  Not too much was revealed that wasnt already strongly suggested from the partial wording of his effect we could previously see.  Hes obviously a staple in Silvan decks, I personally think i'll use him to bring back the much maligned yet underrated in my opinion defender of the naith who is really one of the only decent defenders the trait has

 

Henneth Annun Guard- I actually really like this card...BUT i'm not sure how often he'll actually see play, theres just a lot of options for high cost tactics allies.  Giving credit where credit is due, this is probably one of the better doomed allies we've seen.  The herald of arnor was good too but the others, the ability was just not impactful enough.  In a gondor themed deck he could flourish.

 

Charge of the Rohhirm- I do think its a good card but i think it has to been seen as a kind of supplementary effect not something to rely on.  As mentioned by others before its a good board sweep card.  I'll also look forward to unthematic hijinks with this by using it with gandalf/shadofax and Glorfindel/asfaloth.

 

Galadriel's Handmaiden- the spirit ally everyone knew was coming.  probably the weakest of all the "when entering play" effects but as the TC guys mentioned in the video her 2 will power makes her just a solid questing ally in her own right.

 

Mirror of Galadriel-  How cool is this card? Just a great thematic win.  Reminds me of palantir in regards to player cards that have powerful but also negative effects but i think this one is much more worth the risk.  Any card in the top 10 is just so good for this game especially if you're running a deck without lore so card drawing may be a premium.  I cant wait to to run this and see it in action.

 

Lorien Cloak- i generally really hate playercards that are scenario dependent aka all those mountain dependent cards from the darrowdelf cycle but I still think this one is very playable in its own right.  Even if its just a cheap +1 defense boost in a sphere that doesnt often see things like that.  Also really pleased its not restricted because that would have killed its playability.  I think it'll make a nice addition for either elf trait.

Regarding Henneth Annun Guard... how can you not be sure about this card? Check other 3-cost tactics guys. They're either dedicated attackers or dedicated defenders. This one here can do both. Boostable by Boromir and Visionary Leadership, vulnurable to Behind Strong Walls, Gondorian Discipline, For Gondor! and Mutual Accord.

How are you going to use this with Gandalf and/or Glorfindel? Are you gonna hope for Nor Am I A Stranger to show up too? I guess with a Gandalf deck, you should have the card draw to depend on this combo showing up at some point.

---

On another note, Cloak of Lorien may make Defender of the Naith a bit more useful. Once he has 3 defense, he becomes much more useful. You could also give him Elven Mail, which has a limited effect due to Defender of the Naith already having sentinel, but it's still pretty good. Kinda sucks that you need so many card to have a decent Silvan defender though.

The unthematic hijinks will only work if you also include Nor Am I A Stranger, since it did specify Rohan characters.

It's obviously both Gandalf and Glor with NAIAS, it'll just be a good ol' multiplayer setup, no one in their minds gonna do this within one deck.

I think people are underestimating the Handmaiden. Reducing threat by 1 is no small matter, especially when it can bounce multiple times and with Island amid perils and Oh! Lothlorien! You can reduce your threat by 4 for only 2 resources. Second best 2 cost spirit ally after Ethyr Swordsman and his insane value.

Hehe I'll give you a review:

 

Solid quest with a fun little gimmick that involves a secret.

Has time mechanic.

Has treacheries, enemies and locations.

Medium difficulty, expect the soon to come Nightmare mode to appease Glaurung.

Worthy addition to the game's  quest line.

I think there was only 1 person who underestimated handmaiden. I, for one, think that she is a great, wonderful card.

 

She costs only 2, has 2 willpower, reduces threat and even allows you to choose which one's threat to reduce, which is huge.

With Celeborn, he'll often be 3 willpower, and with O, Lorien, she's just a resource. And yes, bouncy-bouncy. She's extremely useful in any spirit deck, regardnless of anything.

I love the random discard aspect of Galadriel's Mirror. if that part wasn't in there, not only would the card not be quite as thematic, but I fear it would be too good. The current designers are doing a great job at building in meaningful limitations to their cards to prevent Dain/Glorfindel madness.

 

And the Mirror quite rightly only attaches to Galadriel.

Henneth Annun guard is pretty amazing. He'll go directly in my Gondor deck, since Boromir with Steward can play him really easily. Great to see another good Gondor ally. My only problem with it is, shouldn't he be a Ranger? Wasn't Henneth Annun custodied by Ithilien rangers?

Galadriel + Regular draw + Mirror = 3 cards per turn & 1 random discard.

That's some solid card draw for spirit.

And no threat gain at the end of each turn also.

Spirit has so much stuff, it's going to be hard to ignore the sphere for each deck I make.

Ok, Galadriel draws you a card per exhaustion. Mirror sorta draws you a card. But what Nenya has to do with drawing?

It was probably just a weird way of saying it.  Nenya doesn't enter into that draw calculation, he was probably just including the regular draw from the resource phase.

Right. What grandspleen said.

Nenya is not needed, my bad.

In which case makes it even easier to set up.

I'm not crazy for theme, but limitations like these actually leave plenty of future design space available for more variety.

You know what else leaves plenty of future design space? Not releasing anything.

 

Whatever, creating a card that is applicible only to one of 60~ currently existing heroes is toxic for the games health. Ofcourse people who'll use Galadriel will be thrilled. But what of others? It's an entire slot of a spirit card, of which we getting only 2 per AP, completely wasted unless you play with Galadriel.

## 62 [FetaCheese on November 9, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126669-celebrimbors-secret-unboxing/?do=findComment&comment=1328306)

These are 2 entirely different issues here. Slow card pool progression vs exclusive cards, which have been staples since the game begun. I wouldn't call either toxic. Hell, there are completely dud cards like that useless neutral card (the end nears or something) that take up slots but I'm not too much bothered because it's normal to have some bad cards in a card game (not intentionally,  it just happens). For similar reasons, exclusive cards are ok by me if they are not overdone, and imo they are not (Gandalf attachments are pushing it though I dont think we'll be seeing a similar release in the near future). And yes, I'd like more cards released per year but that's a different matter.

 

If anything I'd rather get rid of the boons.

So what? They just add flavor and identity to a hero. They are good cards but not must-haves so its fine by me. Its not like Glorfindel, Aragorn, Eomer, Elrond, Idraen and Gandalf don't have their own unique or near-unique items. Besides, Ghaladriel feels incomplete gameplay wise without her ring. And the Mirror is entirely optional and risky.

I think, by now I've made it pretty clear "so what" is it. It's good it adds flavor and identity to a hero. It's bad it adds it at an expense of flavor and identity of the game. I never approved of such things, not just with Galadriel.

You mean that theme bullsh1t that attracts and engages so many people to the game? Yup.

 

Look, I think we can all agree that more player cards would be better. At the same time, name attachments add flavor and distinctiveness to individual heroes beyond their game text.

No, I mean that theme bullsh1t that kills diversity of the game with the slowest player card pool progression of all FFG's titles.

 

Why yes, they add flavor, but at what cost?

Yeah, I get what you're saying, and maybe if the card pool grew a bit faster, we'd all be happier. It's an interesting question from the designer's perspective. Would people buy packs with just player cards? Or a deluxe expansion with just player cards? For all of us, the clear answer is yes, we'll buy pretty much anything they put out. For that silent majority of people out there who buy and play but don't voice their opinions on forums, I don't know. Hard to say, probably? Anyway, this discussion has come up over and over again, so back to the card discussion...

Tying a few things together, I'm very happy that this pack appears to be the first one in a while that does not have any player cards that are just coasters straight out of the pack.  All the talk about slow player card growth is obviously a legitimate concern among all the players.  I personally dont think anything inhibits the diversity or progression of the pool more than the cards that are absolute duds (looking at you Fall of Gil-Galad, Message from Elrond, Mirkwood pioneer).

The character specific attachments are coasters for all the other heroes, but absolutely essential to any deck built with said hero, so they are not coasters at all since they will most likely be played whenever that hero is chosen.

I am completely supportive of this. I am much more in favor of these types of cards than cards that are coasters regardless of heroes played, and there are plenty of those.

And on another note this cycle has delivered a number of cards that only pertain to 2-4 player games. I play one handed solo, so cards like that for me are a complete bummer, but I just suck it up rather than complain because i realize those cards may be valuable to those other modes of play, and the developers can't please everyone all the time.

So, in that light character specific attachments provide more depth and theme to a character, and the last two attachments have done just that fantastically. I can't wait to give them a try.

Eh. I largely agree with MNT. My favorite type of card is something like Light of Valinor: It was obviously designed for a specific character (Spirit Glorfindel), but it's not limited to him. If Steward of Gondor isn't limited to just Denethor, then why can't we figure out some way for the Mirror to be more versatile? Frodo used it too. Other people used it... but it still needs to be limited in some way obviously. I don't know. I don't mind Galadriel having her ring, but how many cards that are specific to a single hero is too many?
