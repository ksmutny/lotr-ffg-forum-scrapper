Spoilt in the new preview, the Tactics doomed X card "Close Call". I tried to stress the point in the preview thread but since there was no answer and I am eager to be sure, I do it again: those of you confident with rules, do you think Close Call can be used to cancel damage otherwise dealt to hero Beorn? I am saying yes since it seems to work as Dori's ability, but I would like to hear others...

## 2 [alogos on January 8, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96500-close-call/?do=findComment&comment=948824)

Same wording as Dori, so, yes.

## 3 [Style75 on January 8, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96500-close-call/?do=findComment&comment=948837)

If so, then Close Call becomes an auto-include 3 copies in every deck with hero Beorn. I'd like to see an official ruling on this. Maybe someone can email Caleb or Matt?

## 4 [Mndela on January 8, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96500-close-call/?do=findComment&comment=948848)

Can you avoid the damage dealt to Beorn by Dori? :blink: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_blink.png]  Sure?

## 5 [lleimmoen on January 8, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96500-close-call/?do=findComment&comment=948882)

Yeah, Dori's ability has officially been confirmed as applicable for Beorn.

This.

 

Only seems logical to me.

## 7 [Raven1015 on January 8, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96500-close-call/?do=findComment&comment=948991)

I think since the effect is targeting the damage itself (like Dori) that it should be fair game.

## 8 [Glaurung on January 8, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96500-close-call/?do=findComment&comment=949114)

Beorn will hits a table???? For the NM Hobbit yes sure why not???

## 9 [legolas18 on January 14, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96500-close-call/?do=findComment&comment=953754)

Got an official ruling from Caleb:

Since Close Call targets the damage and not the hero, Beorn's immunity to player card effects would not prevent it's ability from resolving as printed.

Cheers,

Caleb

W00t - yet another reason to bring the bear to your favorite Troll-slaying party!

## 11 [lleimmoen on January 14, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96500-close-call/?do=findComment&comment=954034)

Yes, I am happy about it. I was hoping for some bear synergy since Beorn first appeared. After initial hesitation I got a great reward (in fun) playing the hero version, and have hardly ever run out of his hit points -- but it is true that I was very cautious about it. Now, a much bolder approach can be undergone with this new safety option in hand.

 

ps: Threat reduction or coop much needed for Tactics, still.

Tactics is the sphere with most sentinel and ranged characters. That does kinda qualify for being coop in my book

## 13 [lleimmoen on January 15, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96500-close-call/?do=findComment&comment=954837)

You did not get it. At least I think. What I meant was that Tactics needs coop game in order to shine, they still lack in solo (mono-Tactics that is) compared to the other three spheres.

## 14 [Bullroarer Took on January 15, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96500-close-call/?do=findComment&comment=954940)

Yes, Foe Hammer finally let Tactics draw cards. If only Goblin Cleaver had knocked off a few points of threat.

We'll get there soon enough I hope, maybe in the next cycle.

## 16 [lleimmoen on January 17, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96500-close-call/?do=findComment&comment=956633)

I hope so as well. Especially as we've been told the older concepts should not die. Well, one of the concepts are mono-sphere decks. And that should mean that one is to be competitive with any of the four mono decks, including solo play. As it is, mono-Tactics cannot win many games, especially outside the HoN and AtS. That needs to change. I know it is not easy to maintain the uniqueness but it is certainly possible. A card like Close Call is a very good step, since (together with the Gondorian Discipline) it provides a way to cancel damage, and it is nice in many ways: it does keep the distinction between spheres (Lore has healing, Tactics has prevention, Spirit has retrieval) and gives Tactics some edge. The next step should be more card draw (Foe-Hammer alone is not enough, especially till we have more weapons, we still have very few) and especially threat reduction.

 

As for the latter it could be something of the like: "if you have this or that, you won't have to raise your threat after questing unsuccessfully," or "if you do this or that this round, you won't have to raise your threat in the re-fresh phase."

So with close call the damage never happens? For example if an enemy would do six damage and kill the hero if I played close call the hero is not dead is if the damage never happened?

## 18 [joezim007 on September 12, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96500-close-call/?do=findComment&comment=1260024)

Correct. It is "cancelled", so it never happened. Just like Spirit Frodo's ability.

## 19 [raven614 on September 12, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96500-close-call/?do=findComment&comment=1260025)

Nice thank you. Playing now.

## 20 [Bullroarer Took on September 12, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96500-close-call/?do=findComment&comment=1260061)

It's a very good card.

## 21 [Glaurung on September 12, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96500-close-call/?do=findComment&comment=1260204)

Yes I do like close call too. Really good card and one from not much cards witch can interact with Beorn hero

## 22 [raven614 on September 13, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96500-close-call/?do=findComment&comment=1260254)

Nice to know I have use beorn a lot but just got close call. Thanks for the input. Lately I've been trying a themed deck with the Rohan but boy is it tough to get what you want. Maybe I could go with Theoden, Eomer, and Beorn. An all tactics deck. Just a thought. No fee.
