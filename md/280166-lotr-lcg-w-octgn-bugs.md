# [LotR LCG w/ OCTGN - Bugs](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/280166-lotr-lcg-w-octgn-bugs/)

I've been playing LotR LCG in OCTGN almost daily for the last couple weeks.  During that time I've encountered the following bugs (which are erratic rather than 100% reproducible):

1) Scripting errors when playing Hunt for Gollum - These appeared in red in the chat/log (on the left) and referred to actions.py.

2) Ctrl-N no longer adds resources or cards - instead, it only refreshes characters and increased threat.  I think this started happening after the scripting errors mentioned earlier.  To fix it, I have to manually add resources and draw cards. 

3) Player 2's cards are drawn by player 1.  For instance, if player 1 is leadership/lore and player 2 is tactics/spirit, sometimes a spirit or tactics card is drawn into player 1's hand.

4) I can no longer add resources.  This was after many of the above errors occurred.  I could not find a workaround, so had to restart OCGTN.

5) The first player token doesn't move back and forth.  Should it?

 

Perhaps I am using Ctrl-N wrong?  I usually just hit CTRL-N and the following happens:

- threat increases
- characters refresh
- each hero gets 1 resource
- each player draws 1 card

I then have to manually move the first player token to the other player.

I don't use CtrL-R or any other turn management functionality.  Should I be doing something differently?

 

Also, should I be posting these bugs here, or is there a better place to post them?

1- no idea

2- Sometimes this just bugs out on OCTGN, it should be back to working after a game or two.

3- Hmm, I’ve never had that happen to me, maybe it has something to do with how you took control of you 2.0’s deck.

4- no idea

5- yeah, you have to do it manually when playing two-handed since you are the “only” player. It works by itself in multiplayer.

Nope, you’re using Ctrl-N correctly. There’s a bug submission form on OCTGN’s website. You could also post questions in the CotR discord channel or on BGG.

According to the LOTR LCG OCTGN page, you should add bug reports and feature requests on the OCTGN page [http://octgngames.com/lotrlcg/feedback/].
