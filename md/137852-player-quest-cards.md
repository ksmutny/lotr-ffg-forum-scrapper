So maybe I just missed it, but are the optional player quest cards coming out with The Lost Realm going to be limited to certain quests? Or are they just a new player card type that you can add to any deck?

Pretty sure you can add them to any deck against any quest!

That totally needed it's own thread, lol.

Well you were really active in the other thread, and I was hoping to avoid your unreliable and unhelpful input, but oh well.

It burns the eyes to see this:

 

"it's" = it is, not a possessive pronoun; one would think after hanging out on the internet all day long, you could learn that; so why bother reaching for the apostrophe to create this atrocity

 

The possessive pronoun is "its"

One of the more understandable lines I've ever seen here.

Wait, you only have one? It seems I learned something from this thread after all... :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Well, I might have others, but they are not as vocal as this one. Maybe there is even treachery going on of the Steward's Fear level!

I'm hurt Trolo! I haven't made my disdain for your unneccesary rudeness and undeserved air of superiority well known? I waited too long! C'est la vie...

I'm really looking forward to side quests. They'll hopefully increase the replayability and preferred strategy in pretty much any of the older scenarios!

See, you do not hate me. You just don't like the way I express myself sometimes. That other guy - it's personal, he hates my guts.

Chris, here's what I do: click your username in the top right corner, click "Edit my profile" and go to "Ignore preferences". That way you won't see their posts. I've done that with a number of users on this forum and it vastly improves the experience.

Getting back on track...one thing that I wondered is how these side-quests alter the overall dynamic of earlier quests. Nightmare decks aside, some quests are much easier if you can stall certain quest phases, and before this always needed careful questing. Now we can buffer with side quests (albeit not that many).

## 16 [MyNeighbourTrololo on March 15, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/137852-player-quest-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1490801)

Well, if your board position is flimsy, you can hinder yourself by accidentely questing less than needed to clear the side quest, for example.
