It was about this time last month that we first heard about Road to Rivendell.

It was about this time in October when we first heard about The Redhorn Gate.

I noticed that the main FFG website has begun its announcement articles for the other games this week.

Do you think we'll get an announcement article for the third Adventure Pack this week?  I'm guessing by Monday at the latest.  I'm hoping to get it by Friday.

My guess is that we'll see the preview of the "Tentacle" set that contains Doors of Durin (see the Dwarrowdelf cycle announcement article for a sneak peek at that card).  I hope we get to see a player card from that expansion.  I'd love to see the hero, but they have not been previewing those lately, so I try not to get my hopes up.
