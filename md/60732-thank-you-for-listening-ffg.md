Indeed.  (Just so it's clear, this is in reference to the forum categories that were added.)

Yes... THANK YOU FFG!!!

However, some did ask directly... so to those who did - thank you too!

And, I would add a large thank you to you richsabre for initiating conversation that in one way or another seems as if it was part of what lead to the creation of the subforums. Your efforts to bring attention to this issue and generate support have had great value. It's an exciting day. Nice job!

Now, which subforum do you think best suites threads about Tournaments?  Player Community?

I can't believe this finally happened.

 Wow! This is so cool! . . . Maybe I should actually use the subforums first instead of just posting right away after seeing that they've been added. Oh well. Thanks to all who were involved!

yeah great.. just what "we" wanted.. splitting of the community into pointless sections, your website is so bloody slow and now instead of loading a single page to see the topic list we now have to load 5 pages... on a bad day this could add 20 mins to the "check the forum out for new posts" Despite when the loud and pushy vocal minority wanted this is nothing but a bad idea and makes this site worse.

If you wana help your community delete this abortion of a forum software and install a fast one that is friendly to mobile devices, has normal functions like edit post so people can work on "real" faq threads and the allowing of bbcode like every other place on the internet... and speed.. make it faster!

Thanks, FFG!  I, too, appreciate the convenience of limiting the threads to those of which I am immediately interested.

I don't know if this is accurate or not, but I imagine booored as some curmudgeon, sitting in his recliner, with his laptop, and cursing this new fad the kids are calling the "internet".  LOL

He is right though. Try to edit your post right now...you cant. Try posting from your phone...you cant, I cant anyway. These are  frustrating and unnecessary limitations.

as much as i hate this forum software which is limiting and takes sometimes 10 minutes to load up, i dont think they can do much about it, its not like catagories for instance which they can add/take away, we're talking the entire forum site, encompassing all of the games. it looks as if for whatever reason they decided on this software and are now stuck with it for the forseeable future.

im not going to make this about the horrible software though, the introduction of catagories is an obvious step to making the forum a more user friendly place,and more than that it was a sign that they actually care about us on here, though if they decide to change it, like buggery am i going to complain :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]
