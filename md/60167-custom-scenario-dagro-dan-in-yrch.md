Hello.
This is my first - fully tested - custom scenario.
I tried it with 1 to 4 players and some variations.


Since I'm planning a mega-campaign to my players, I'm customizing quests between the normal cycle and this is one of them, this is after Anduin and before Carrock (no Escape!). I hope you all like it.

 

It is a difficulty 3/4 scenario with lots of battle.
C'mon, go there and punish these filthy orcs!

Looks good.  Thanks for sharing!  If you don't mind, I may add this to the next version of my Vassal module.
