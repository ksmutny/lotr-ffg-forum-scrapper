They bend in both directions for me, too, but these bending effects are equal and that makes them lying flat. Sometimes I have to rebend them into the "middle" position, but so far I only had little problems with them.

cant say ive experienced this just with them.....its sub zero here and some cards are slightly bending in the cold i think.... but after a night of putting a thick deck onto of them they straighten out

I use dragon shields and no bending of any kind going on

 I haven't noticed it yet.  I cover mine with inexpensive thin plastic card covers.  Seem okay so far.
