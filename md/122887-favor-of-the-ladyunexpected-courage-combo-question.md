# [Favor of the lady/Unexpected courage combo question](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/122887-favor-of-the-ladyunexpected-courage-combo-question/)

Hi all.

 

I just recently started playing LotR, and Have a question about a card combo that I am using.

 

I have THEODRED as my main questing hero, with the following attachments on him:

 

THE FAVOR OF THE LADY

UNEXPECTED COURAGE

 

Would I be correct to play this card combo during the questing phase as follows?

 

1 - Exhaust THEODRED for two WILLPOWER, THE FAVOR OF THE LADY attachment adding the second WILLPOWER

2 - Place a TOKEN on a questing hero

3 - Exhaust UNEXPECTED COURAGE to ready THEODRED

4 - Exhaust THEODRED for two WILLPOWER, THE FAVOR OF THE LADY attachment adding the second WILLPOWER

5 - Place a second token on a questing hero

 

This results in a total of 4 WILLPOWER and two TOKENS from his ability and the card combo.

 

Or should it be done as below?

 

1 - Exhaust THEODRED for one WILLPOWER

2 - Place a TOKEN on a questing hero

3 - Exhaust UNEXPECTED COURAGE to ready THEODRED

4 - Exhaust THEODRED for one WILLPOWER

5 - Place a second token on a questing hero

6 - Add one WILLPOWER from THE FAVOUR OF THE LADY

 

This way results in a total of 3 WILLPOWER and two TOKENS.

 

I believe the correct resolution is the top one, but just want to double check.

 

Thanks!

First of all: welcome to the game!

Then to answer your question:

Sorry, but that's not quite correct. You can only commit characters once to the quest. Favor of the lady does give you +1 willpower, but you commit Theodred only once: so he has 2 willpower to commit. His response can thus also be only triggered once, giving you 1 resource token on another hero committed to the quest.

After you commited everyone to the quest, there is an action window in which you can use Unexpected Courage to ready Theodred, so he can participate in the upcoming combat phase. You cannoy use UC to ready and commit Theodred again.

Hope my answer helps you!

Thanks for the welcome :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

Yikes! I got that one wrong...

 

Thanks for the clarification on this. Back to Eowyn by the looks of it then :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

You could use the Aragorn - Theodred combo.  Commit them both to the quest, use Theodreds response to give Aragorn a resource and then use Aragorns response for readying him with the resource he just got from Aragorn. 
Maybe that helps! 

Good luck and happy to help!

I generally agree with the answer above, however, I have interpreted Theodred's power to allow him to grant himself an additional resource token if he is committed to the quest and does not want or cannot give it to another hero.

 

The card says:

 

Response: After Theodred commits to a quest, choose a hero committed to that quest. Add 1 hero to that hero's resource pool.

 

As I see it, Theodred is a hero, and if he is committed to the quest, then he could give himself that additional resource token. Nothing in the power says he has to choose "another" or a "different" hero committed to the quest… though of course he can do so if he so chooses.

Yes, the resource on Theodred response can be given either to him or to another hero that has commited to the quest...

Yes, of course he can give the resource to himself.

But a[b\] is a strong word so he can give the resource to any hero committed to the quest, even to a hero you do not control. I just meant to give some advice on how you could use theodred instead of eowyn for the willpowerthing.

I mistyped it indeed, thanks for the correction!

Maby not that important in this topic, but with the passing of Theodred you need to pay attention to who's first player, since you can only pass it to heroes committed to the quest. So as first player you are forced to pass it to one of your own committed heroes, as second player you can pass it to the first players committed heroes or those of yourself. But for instance, as first player, you cannot pass the resource to the second/third player. This is all because the first player has to commit his characters, before the second player, before the third,.....

Thought it worth mentioning since I see this going wrong sometimes when new players start to play multiplayer.

Why not? If the first/second players have characters committed to the quest, they would be perfectly legal targets for the third player's Theodred to pass his resource token to.

Read his last post ziggy. Players commit characters to questing in order from first to last player so if the first player commits Theodred only his heroes are committed to the quest when Theodreds ability triggers and thus only his heroes are valid targets

Jban probably just mistyped.  The rest of the post makes sense.  That one line that ziggy quoted contradicts the rest of Jban's post.... so probably just an error.

 

The third player commits characters after the first and second player have committed characters, so if the third player is using Theodred, he/she can give the resource to any questing hero from player 1, 2, or 3.

Corrected.

Indeed mistyped
