# [So are they ever coming out?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/106617-so-are-they-ever-coming-out/)

I really thought it shall be different this time but it now seems even worse. Voice of Isengard was announced last August with the release for Xmas. Then it was late January I believe but I still believed at least the adventure packs would start coming out regularly with only a slight delay after the deluxe. Their opening pack, Dunland Trap, was announced to be out early Q2, this was still early in the year, so I again had a false belief that such a feat was more than achievable. Yet, May is now quickly waning and Dunland Trap is not out. The Road Darkens has for some time now been scheduled for Q2 but an experienced buyer of the game can hardly believe ffg to ever keep their release promises.

 

Are you, as me, down-hearted by this? Or are you (as me, Gollum-sided) relieved because you do not have to give ffg money so frequently?

I'm patiently waiting and spending the money on other FFG's games.

Oh poor you. I feel already bad having spent so much on a game (though it is not as bad as keep spending it on car-repair, for instance), so I am glad Tolkien is my only virtue on ffg list.

 

Has anyone got an intel of the updated release schedule or is the "upcoming" page our best reference?

I don't mind waiting if they would just stop lying about when they'd because released.

There is a wonderful Radiohead song called Let Down. It is not very applicable outside the title, but it may still help us all, haha!

The 1st until the 3rd AP are supposed to be expected in Q2.

So says the almighty upcoming page.

Q2 starts next week, and the 1st AP is still in concept status?

That means: printer + boat ride + shipping = 3 months minimum.

For the 1st pack that is. AP 2 & 3 will not make it to the stores in Q2.

Don't expect the cycle to start before late Q2 (June) or Q3 people....

 

 

Posted this before Q2....looks like my prediction is coming true....

My long experience of FFG's missed release dates leads me to no surprise, or anguish, or anything. Basically, I've learnt to expect the packs to be released when they're released.

I think feast or famine will pretty much always be the rule for this game. Before you know it, we'll be talking about how we're getting flooded with packs and The Road Darkens and don't have time to play everything!

Summer has come and passed
The innocent can never last
Wake me up when September ends

Like my father's come to pass
Seven years has gone so fast
Wake me up when September ends

Here comes the rain again
Falling from the stars
Drenched in my pain again
Becoming who we are

As my memory rests
But never forgets what I lost
Wake me up when September ends

Summer has come and passed
The innocent can never last
Wake me up when September ends

Ring out the bells again
Like we did when spring began
Wake me up when September ends

Here comes the rain again
Falling from the stars
Drenched in my pain again
Becoming who we are

As my memory rests
But never forgets what I lost
Wake me up when September ends

Summer has come and passed
The innocent can never last
Wake me up when September ends

Like my father's come to pass
Twenty years has gone so fast
Wake me up when September ends

Wake me up when September ends
Wake me up when September ends

I for one am getting really really over the wait...... I thought Dunland trap and The Road Darkens would both be out by now and I would be waiting on the next release....!

They really need to release products when they say they will..... these delays are awful, almost everyone on the boards is desperately waiting for the new cycle. I really hope they see all our complaining and push things along a bit, Q2 is almost 2/3 of the way over and the only product we will be getting before July will be Dunland trap... I bet all the Q3 products will come like mid to late September as well....

Dunland Trap is on the boat, Three Trials is at the printer but all the others are still in development.. I think we still have a solid month till we get the first pack but all the others seem to be taking a really long time. They definitely won't all be here by Qtr 2 if by quarter 2 they mean April-June ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

It seems all these packs are getting more thought and polish to make them great but at the expense of delayed release which I'd much rather have a better product and longer wait.

If at least they chained the packs close together -- like one in three weeks or so after they finally get going. For a time I thought the adventure packs in the same cycle are all printed at once but that was most probably a misinformation.

> Dunland Trap is on the boat, Three Trials is at the printer but all the others are still in development..

AFAIK the cycles are being designed as a whole at once and then it is just the matter of continual releases.

Narsil I agree there are more important stuff in life, but they could just be honest about release time, it would be a good thing to do for your customers

I don't know, why I read the word "lying" here so often. The point is, these things are schduled to be released. No one ever gave a guaranty that this will happen as scheduled. There are so many things to consider that can happen on the transport from China to the US. The thing is (as far as I understand): They make a plan, the commiúnicate this plan to the customer, things don't go as it was planned.

You could argue that this happens very regularly so why don't they calculate this in and make a less tight schedule but on the other hand, we know that this happens very regular and so I don't understand why anyone is still relying on this schedule since we are used to these delays

It's assumed that when a company makes a claim they are aiming for that claim. If we were supposed to just add an unknown number onto the end of any claim then why make it? January? Oh so you mean, feb or march? Lets all guess! New players wouldn't know this for one and those of us who do would expect the unmet promise would be a mistake. You would think that a company who didn't keep their deadline would, like you said, make it less strict or not say one at all.

We are paying customers, and to be more specific, possible paying customers, I'm sure some people have quit on the idea due to being stuffed around. It's just bad business etiquette.

Why are you so happy to be stuffed around and defend bad etiquette?

I'm not happy, I take things as they are.

Look, there are two options: You can live with the way they handle these things or you could just stop being a customer.

Maybe it's some kind of arrogance that FFG doesn't care about these things cause there are many people like me that buy their stuff anyway. So why should they change? Because some people complaining in this forum? I don't think and if you're honest you know that I'm right about this.

 

But if a miracle happens and they change things, what could happen? Maybe they don't tell us any release dates like "Look, here is the preview for the next expansion but we don't tell you when it will be released so you can't complain when it's not on time." or "Look on this, it will be released somewhere between March and November." Is that something you wanna read?

Then we will again have threads like this one with people who dislike the way they handle the release schedules

I agree with Zorni. I just want to add that everyone here wants to have these spoiler news ASAP. But when they deliver tehse spoilers early and we have to wait (and wait and wait) for the expansions to come out, people are unhappy again. Perhaps they should just delay these spoilers until they're confident about the release date of their expansions?

People will always be unhappy at waiting. People are unhappy if we don't get enough spoilers, they're unhappy if we get too many spoilers. People are unhappy if the product they wanted in Q2 actually comes at the start of Q3 - but people would be unhappy if FFG said, coming 2014, because it's so unspecific.

The complaints will stop when it comes out (Until the next time people have to wait).

 

It's not lying on any scale. Lying is a deliberate deceit (for instance, I take your pre-order with no intention of ever making the product). Expecting the product in Q2 and not getting it till the 7th calendar month is just - not meeting the expectation you had. FFG keeps us informed of the internal progress they think they're having. They only give a definite street date when they actually have a definitive one

Sorry Rapier, but you are lying as well. At least according to English as we know it, the definition of lying is exactly: Not telling the truth.

I coppied the text from the Oxford dictionary. Sometimes it is better not to make up stuff either.

Or make four previews (of one spoilt card each for instance) for every pack -- just as they used to two years ago if you remember. And three would be enough I say: one announcement, one about the story for example, and one show-casing new strategy (with given player card or two). That way you can still spoil no more than three or four player cards and a few encounters and everybody is happy, or happier. Especially if you make a more realistic estimate as to when the pack will be out. I mean, these people must have had some experience by now, and to be missing the date by seasons, that is getting old.

This is highly debatable on a semantic level, and these forums are not meant for such discussions. I agree with Rapier that lying should be considered an intentional action, and FFG's delays simply unfortunate circumstances (if they are honest in their predictions, that is). If I were making a card game like this, I would tweak and re-design the releases until they where as perfect as possible. These things take time. I think we should let them, and take their rather optimistic release dates with a grain of salt. Get another hobby while you wait.

For the record, I didn't get Voice of Isengard until today, and so, I'll happily await the new APs.

I undestand you not. Rapier brought the thing about defining a word which I thought needs it not. And you are ok with it because you agree with the person otherwise, and you tell me off just for providing a valid definition of the word, finding it unfit for the forums. Someone can really be objective I see.

What can I be, other than objective (for that is exactly what I'm trying to be)? If your gripe is with the lexical definition of "lying", you are now faced with the definition of "truth" - and that is a discussion as old as philosophy itself and not one worth having here. My point is not to "tell you off" - I advised you to do something more productive than to write this kind of posts.

I think I'll take my own advice now and go visit a topic that actually discusses the game.

Excuse me, but what definition from the Oxford Dictionary did you find? 

My oxford dictionary says this for the first meaning of lying: An intentionally false statement

The only statement I can find that matches yours is the use of lying as an adjective, on the merriam-webster dictionary website (who I don't really rate, as I find most of their word definitions are too simplistic and actually miss out a lot of meaning).

I have found no instances of lie (noun, verb) which do not refer to intent as well as being factually wrong,and I will go further than that and state categorically that such an instance will not exist. A lie is defined as intentional deception (synonyms: dishonest). This is English as we know it.

Just being wrong (without intent to deceive) is NOT lying.

I was merely saying that I didn't think FFG were lying; I think they're wrong. They provide the information to us in good faith. I really don't think they will change anything on their scheduling from any complaints. It does look like Q2 will prove to be incorrect this time as they only have two weeks to hit that deadline.

On the other hand the entirety of the upcoming section of the ffg website is predicated with the word expected: so none of it is actually a hard and fast commitment.

So in actual fact I think FFG can't actually miss them; it's like a plumber giving you an estimate for the cost of work,it's a guideline. It isn't the same as a salesman telling you the cost of an item and then charging you something different. The product will be what they say it is, and within a reasonable time-frame of their estimate.

 

Edit: Also I think that these forums are for discussion in general, I would be happy to discuss the finer points of lying and truth on them if people wished to do so. I respect the people on this forum and think the conversation could be respectful and interesting - although it isn't game related. 

We could relate it to the game by discussing it in relation to the nebulous table talk rules.

What is really annoying about this matter is the lack of information. There's no even a date for the first AP. I don't find so difficult to give at least that to the players after four months since Voice of Isengard release.

Q1: Jan/Feb/Mar

Q2: Apr/May/June

Q3: July/Aug/Sept

Q4: Oct/Nov/Dec

 

They still have another month and a half to meet their deadline of Q2...

 

In addition, FFG updated The Dunland Trap on 4/23 to be "On the Boat" and this "generally takes 4-6 weeks" to reach the warehouse. From there, it takes 7-10 days to ship from the warehouse to retailers. So, if we take the longer end of both scales, we should expect this AP around June 14th - which is still inside Q2.

Er yes, for some reason I was thinking Q2 ended in May - so that means they have a good chance of hitting it with the first AP at least.

on top of that, FFG has released two APs in the same month before, due to delays in other packs. this happened ever since Hunt for Gollum (which was stopped by customs .... twice!). sometimes things are out of FFG's control!

 

http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=2460 [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=2460]

 

"Getting The Hunt for Gollum past the Teeth of Mordor and into our warehouse proved an epic quest, worthy of any hobbit! We began as cheerful and bright-eyed as the happiest of Shire-folk, eager to deliver the first Adventure Pack and its new cards, but our journey wouldn’t prove easy. Along the way, we suffered our first setback with problems at the printer. Once the cards left the printer, the Dark Lord turned his watchful eye toward us. As he sought our shipment, we were delayed not by one, but two random custom checks! Chances are greater we’d meet Master Underhill heading down the Ephel Dúath than we would ever again face two random custom checks on the same shipment. As agents carefully inspected the cards, we could do little but eat our lembas, keep our heads low in our elvish robes, and wait. At length, everything was found in proper order. Now, we have The Hunt for Gollum in our warehouse and have started shipping it to our distributors!"

You are probably quite right. Having read your first claim about lying I did went on to browse for the "official" definition in Oxford Dictionary and I did copy and paste what was there. Perhaps I was too quick and I did use the adjective line, or perhaps we have different navigations. But I see, your citation makes sense. But it was not me who went for the philosophy about lying in the first place.

One more linguistic detail, before I am off. I would not mention this to a non-native speakers but someone as sophisticated as you should not be using "it's" as a pronoun, as you almost always seem to be doing, "it's" only abbreviates "it is" or "it has" whilst the pronoun is "its".

I simply cannot believe all of the infantile whining I've read in this thread. I am as anxious for the next Saga Expansion and the APs for The Voice of Isengard as anyone else. That said, why would FFG "lie", i.e, intentionally make a false statement? As much of a cash cow and precious (sorry) licence as LOTR is, the last thing FFG would do is make intentionally misleading and/or false statements. 

 

The Lord of the Rings intellectual property is quite jealously guarded as it should be. I am confident that FFG is well aware of this and would do nothing to lose that licence.

 

I will assume that most if not all of us have most/all of the LOTR: LCG sets. With the immense possibilities of decks yet to be built in the card pool as it is, why not try some deck building and take on some quests with a whole different approach if you are so impatient? If that doesn't strike your fancy, how about doing something else until these new products are released?

 

Here are a few ideas:

 

Explore the known universe: http://en.spaceengine.org/ [http://en.spaceengine.org/]

 

Play MTG for free and with every card: http://www.slightlymagic.net/forum/ [http://www.slightlymagic.net/forum/]  I especially recommend Manalink, Forge and BotArena

 

Read great books! How long has it been since you have immersed yourself in The Lord of Rings, The Silmarillion, The Lay of the Beleriand?

 

Volunteer at an animal shelter!

 

Play a boardgame that isn't a money sink such as Mageknight, Thunderstone: Advance, Tomb and Tomb Cryptmaster, Mice and Mystics, the D&D "big box" games, Pathfinder ACG, Talisman, Arkham Horror, etc.

 

Star gaze

 

Pick up a hobby!

Posted 08 April 2014 - 06:55 PM

The dunland trap is now at the printers!!!

I posted this on the 8th of April... it is now the 30 of May. This means it has been over 7 weeks and still nothing....cmon ffg.... this is getting ridiculous...

I live in Australia so even once it gets off the boat there's the two weeks to get it out to retailers and then I'll probably have to wait another two weeks (this happened with VOI) so there is no way I'm going to get it before June ends..... possibly even after June at this rate...

Really unimpressed. I've been checking this site almost every day for the last month or so and am just constantly dissapointed.
 

Why the **** are the cards even sent via boat? I'm really really confused.... We are in the 21st century...... put that **** on a plane and we'd have it in a few days not 6 goddamn weeks....

 

I'm going to seriously consider getting back into magic and putting this game on hold for a while if releases don't speed up a bit after Dunland Trap. The Road Darkens was also meant to be Q2 was it not? Yeah we aren't gonna get that till like mid Q3 at the earliest. Every single pack in Ring maker has been spoiled except one yet we still don't even have one pack in our hands (don't even have one pack in FFG's hands yet... still on some mysterious boat ride). Everyone is playing with proxies they may not see till close to the end of the year...

I know that there is other stuff to do in the meantime but I don't enjoy deck building (at least not many decks, refining my one set of decks is great fun but without new player cards I can't do that), have played and beaten pretty much every quest (except lake town and the last few nightmare packs which i dont own yet but plan to buy) a handful of times and play on my own as well so its a little bit less fun replaying stuff over and over. Don't get me wrong I still play the game plenty but mainly to improve my high scores and sometimes just to play in general because I love the game and certain quests are fantastic but even so I need new quests and player cards bad....

I guess i'll just have to buy Lake town and the 3 latest nightmare packs for now and continue to be frustrated in our epic wait for new cards.......

Already re-reading LOTR, the new walking dead novel and pet sematary by Stephen King. I also have house of the dead overkill which my girlfriend really likes to play with me. I have plenty of other things to do (not to mention work 5 bloody days a week) but they definitely don't satiate my LOTR LCG cravings.... the game is just too good. Mechanics, art, theme, replayability and different variants (solo, 2/3/4 player, two handed) are all perfect. I need more new quests and player cards and getting them months after we were told we would get them is super disappointing regardless of reason or who/what is to blame.

I agree with everything there Psychorocka. I know that we can't really blame FFG for this but this is getting pretty ridiculous. And no previews or articles in almost a month! Really, if we don't get the Dunland Trap before I finish the Dark Tower series, I'm gonna... complain in this forum.

I am guessing that the transportation by ship is an economical decision by FFG. WotC/Hasbro has a lot more dosh and shipping by air is not a problem for them. I doubt that FFG has that kind of capital. Remember too that shipping by air is based upon weight and is quite expensive whereas shipping over sea is measured in volume and the cost difference is significant!

 

When I moved to Europe I had considered moving everything by air. I am a professional musician and magician and I would have loved having my instruments and books with me on the day I landed here. But the cost to ship it all was in the five figure range by air! By sea, the whole thing cost just over 3,000 USD door to door and that included packing and insurance. The downside was that I had ti wait five weeks for my stuff to arrive.

 

LOTR has become a huge game. The number of blogs and other resources for the game seem to only be rivaled by MTG. Perhaps FFG hadn't anticipated the potential of the game that has become "pasteboard crack." ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

 

But, I have rediscovered other games in addition to replaying LOTR with new decks. If The Road Darkens and the first APs for VOI don't come out by mid-June, then I am going to pick up a couple of expansions for Thunderstone: Advance - which I might add is a brilliant game and not at all expensive. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

Just think though my lady/fellow adventurers, in a couple of months' time, we'll be debating what cards are now really "have to build a deck around these!" necessities. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

The dunland trap has been on the boat since April 24th.

My guess is that it will enter shipping status this week, or the next at the latest.

Which means the Americans will have the 1st AP mid June.

And the Europeans about two weeks later usually, so the end of June.

Don't know about Australia though. Two weeks also?

Anyway, hang in there addicts! eeeeh......people!

Hills nightmare isn't as hard as other nightmare quests, but is certainly more challenging than the original. I have been playing my "middle earths mightiest heroes" deck - Lore Aragorn, Spirit Glorfindel and Tactics Boromir - against these, and found the "no threat reduction" of marshes really challenging. I managed to win both my attempts, but just barely - 49 threat in one game.

I haven't actually got to Mirkwood yet, but I'll be moving on to it soon. Really looking forward to it!

I have been playing my "middle earths mightiest heroes" deck - Lore Aragorn, Spirit Glorfindel and Tactics Boromir - against these, and found the "no threat reduction" of marshes really challenging. I managed to win both my attempts, but just barely - 49 threat in one game.

For that quest, with those heros, I resorted to "mega-sideboarding". I switched Lore Aragorn for the Leadership version and it really made the quest more manageable.

The hills nightmare is actually pretty challenging now. Those tunneling nameless creatures take a lot to kill, always end up attacking you unless you don't want to quest and I think there's 3 of them in the deck so if you're playing multiplayer no chance you only encounter only one of them

Has anyone here payed close attention to the Upcoming Products page to know if they ever update it? Because obviously we'll barely maybe get the Dunland Trap in Q2 but it is literally impossible for all those other packs to come out in Q2 as FFG says. Do they only have their initial release date they hoped for or will they update things and change things to Q3 and Q4 when products will actually come out?  

I'm not trying to complain about late release dates but rather how we're not kept up to date with realistic release date.  There are obviously tons of things to do to occupy our time but the whole Upcoming Products page isn't reliable or worth my time to look at if it's so inaccurate so why don't they update it!?

I always thought the expected QX part was for when the next stage would start, not the final release.

I've believe they do update it in line with my expectation (even if they actually put when they expect the final release and then refine it).

Interesting.. that does seem to be how things usually play out but it does say "Expected by" so we all should be able to look at that Upcoming Products page and say "ok great, I'll be able to play this pack by this month or next quarter!" rather than guessing when things will ever come out because of constant delays.  

 

Right now the "Expected by" date means absolutely nothing until its off the boat and shipping.  So we go from having a super vague idea to when something is coming out to it's shipping and will be here in a week!! That's what annoys me so much, I'm fine with a product coming out late so that it can be polished and well made but why can't the expected by date be more reliable?

I can definitely agree with you Catastrophic on that point. I don't mind waiting for the releases but I wish they could be a little more accurate/realistic about the estimate. I think it's just very hard for them to know how long it will take at the printer/shipping back to US.

This morning they updated the status of Warhammer: Invasion to Shipping Now.  No change to any of the LOTRs.

 

Rapier, I don't understand what you mean.  The "expected" release dates for the first three APs of the cycle were published as "early Q2", "Q2" and "late Q2".  Can you elaborate on what you are saying?

Well, looks like they heard our whingeing and whining. Dunland Trap now says June! There's pros and cons. I was hoping it would be shipping to stores this week but at least they were kind enough to narrow it down a bit.

Exactly the point. I think there would be much less complaining if ffg were a bit more realistic about the dates. And by now they should have a few years of experience behind them. Also, a frequent news/previews would help. The wait would not be so painful if we knew what is going on and what we can expect.

You can trust the upcoming page. It's always been quite accurate.

Their release date on the announcement of a new product tho...should be taken with a grain (bucket?) of salt...

Edit: I meant you can trust the status of the product on the upcoming page; not the release date.

Well, I am much more sceptic about that. The upcoming page had been claiming Dunland Trap as early Q2 and last week (not sure if now) it was claiming the Road Darkens for Q2. First had long become impossible, the second seems just as well.

And I remember before Hunt for Gollum there was a long apologetic article about how Sauron delayed the shipment. Yet, mere three months would seem nice now, not just marginally better than the last two cycles.

By the way are you sure about VoI date? It seems ages since it came out, haha.

Redhorn Gate really got it right: less than two months, that is good business.

As much as an apology for the delay would be nice.... it isn't going to help put the cards in my hands any faster... :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

Nightmare Khazad Dum coming out instantly (as soon as we were made aware of its existence we could buy it) comes very very close to making up for the wait...

They updated the expected date to June not 2 weeks ago.

Yep!!! They also updated three trials which is now on the boat and trouble in tharbad is at the printers. Very good news!!

Plus the two new Saga quests announced, Fog on the Barrowdowns AND Old Forest, BOTH of which you can add to and play as part of the saga....

Pretty awesome news and some very exciting products coming for this game. Really surprised they are doing the barrow downs AND old forest and that they can be added to black riders and the overall saga/campaign. They are really listening to what fans what by the looks of things.

Also I for one am very glad Bombadil will be restricted to the saga quest he appears in, he would be silly as a player card and never ventures out of his area/domain anyway.

I am the opposite. I want Tom and Goldberry badly. It is a game, I have the books already where I know what Tom does, in the game he can be different, I want options. You can already fly Eagles to the halls of Khazad-dum, why should you not be able to take Tom out of the Old Forest -- which surely have happened before the Third Age.

First of all, eagles showed up several times in several places in the books. They deserve to be used anywhere anyone else can be used. Tom barely made the books at all.

Second: Tom is simply a boon card. This does NOT mean there is no way he'll ever come out in any other form.

Please just enjoy the cards you are getting and stop complaining about the ones you don't have. I'm sorry if that came off rude, but it gets to me sometimes.

I'm totally on Ana's side of this one. The new PoD looks great, and I love the idea of additional saga quests to sort of augment the campaign mode, but I can not help[ but be disappointed that Tom is not a playable character. And yes I know that PoDs never contain player cards. Still having this guy as an objective tell me that we will not see a toon version of him for a long time. Maybe not until the end of the next cycle at the earliest.

Well we got 2 Pippins in rapid succession so he COULD show up soon, but it'll still probably be at least a year considering how long things are taking to release.

Yes, I feel the exact same thing, even though it wouldn't make sense at all thematically because it's true he would never leave his lands, I just want the freedom to have him in my deck, and I certainly would, as a neutral high cost ally of course, with some powerful effect, not really high stats though, but decent.

Yes, a one-round ally with decent stats and powerful, totally original, ability. FFG, please, we know it's not easy but you've done it before...

Before Saruman appeared, I was thinking disregarding an enemy for a round would not be too bad for Tom. But now we need something different. How about skipping the quest, travel, encounter and combat phase? That would be pretty thematic, as this is exactly what the Hobbits do in the House of Tom Bombadil.

And what about Goldberry?
