I don't have all the packs yet, so does anyone know if we've seen this Diego Gisbert Llorens piece yet in the game?

Not that I'm aware. This looks like a potential for the 6th Saga, about the trek across the Plains of Gorgoroth.

Argh. My fault for looking at the big picture. Yes, that Skirmisher did look familiar.
