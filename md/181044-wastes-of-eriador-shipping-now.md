Not prime, shipping is high, I went elsewhere.

Just preordered my copy from Board Game Extras. Their shipping has always been very quick and is also fairly affordable.

Great! I can really recommend Team Covenant's subscription service for this - takes barely a week after release from their store in Oklahoma to my mailbox in Sweden. Looking forward to spirit Merry and all the unspoiled cards.

I wonder, if somebody already has it, why wouldn't he share the unspoiled cards with the community?

If someone already has it before it's official release, this might violate FFG's release rules and get the store in trouble. My theory anyway.

Pretty sure cards have been spoiled slightly before release in the past. Usually a handful of stores have it before the FFG online store have it available anyway so its more or less released at that point in a way.

I stand corrected.

It's just kinda depressing to me that we here are boiling in our own juices, starved for any new info, while some member of the community that possess that info simply does nothing with it, while it wouldn't take too much time to describe new unspoiled stuff in a single post or take a few photos :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

Except that there was talk of a man holding the copy of Wastes of Eriador in his very hands on facebook?

That man was one of the designers of the game.  I don't think he is going to spoil the cards for us.

Oh. That changes things. He was referred to by name, so I assumed it was someone's friend or something. I do not know designers by name, except for Caleb.

Yeah, it's just Caleb and Matt that work on the game now.  I think Nate French is also still involved.  Those are the only names I know.

I do too.  And I listen very closely to what those members say.

I'm really looking forward to seeing spoilers for this pack. So far it's been tradition for the first pack of the cycle to include a very powerful staple card, like Gondorian Shield and Firefoot. Really curious about what we'll get this time.

## 22 [PsychoRocka on June 28, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/181044-wastes-of-eriador-shipping-now/?do=findComment&comment=1674038)

Yep bring them on! Really hoping Ranger of Cardolan is amazing.

Where in the world are the spoilers, haha? When Friday was mentioned as a release date, I expected the spoilers to come as early as Thursday or even Wednesday night. I never feared not having them by Monday morning. But hopefully today, they finally arrive. Looking forward! Yes, still...

## 24 [tricil on June 29, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/181044-wastes-of-eriador-shipping-now/?do=findComment&comment=1674917)

In the last cycle, the official release date was usually on a Thursday and some people already got their copies on Tuesday. There are always seller on Amazon who claim to have a particular product before its release but that does not mean they do... so I see no reason to expect anything to be spoiled today.

 

Edit: On the other hand, if somebody really got their copy today already, of course I would be super happy to see some spoilers as soon as possible too! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Spoilers take forever with this game. Not a big enough community and often it takes a little while before someone decides to post spoilers for everyone else.

Far worse than how long spoilers are taking for Wastes; Mount Gram is still at the printers and not on the boat yet.

I'm refreshing these forums several times a day for spoilers. Does anyone know which cards have been confirmed for this pack, other than Spirit Merry and Ranger of Cardolan? I'm not sure how to interpret cards being displayed in the various articles. I'm hoping for Scout Ahead, and Song of Tinuviel (which just has to be awesome!)

There are at least three sellers on Amazon who are selling the pack now, so maybe in a few days people will post spoilers. Cool stuff inc. says the pack releases today ( June 30), though it does say "date subject to change." I am hoping it is today and maybe we get a release article.

## 30 [Fingolfin Fate on June 30, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/181044-wastes-of-eriador-shipping-now/?do=findComment&comment=1676594)

The numbers are probably not accurate but they will do for reference.

1 Hero Spirit Merry
2 Leadership ? ?

3 Leadership Event ? -- the card partly spoiled with the Rohan banner and most of the text, I bet the title is Rally

4 Tactics Ally Honour Guard

5 Tactics ? ?

6 Spirit ? ?

7 Spirit ? ?

8 Lore ? ?

9 Lore Side Quest Scout Ahead

10 Neutral Ally Ranger of Cardolan - text only partly spoiled

I'm tentatively saying I will be getting my copy today, I can post spoilers if they haven't come out already if everything arrives when it says it should.

Oh, do! The few of us are hungry. By the way, do you guys, you know the few always lurking about, do you feel a bit awkward? Well I don't, probably because I don't have many other addictions like this.

 

Also, have I missed anything in the list just above? Or is anything as it shouldn't be? Though we should soon find out "all"...

Yes, please do. I am less optimistic about a release article today. I think it would already have been posted. It also looks like cool stuff will not be shipping my pack today either

Mount Gram is now on the boat.  Hopefully we will get it by early August.

I don't know how you're going to feel about it Glaurung, but I played it two handed solo and thought it was pretty tough. When the Day/Night card turns to Night another encounter card is revealed, so you always feel a little behind the 8 ball and the encounter deck combos really well. I felt like anytime an additional quest card came up I was in a load of trouble. If you're able to get through the first part of the quest and get established you'll probably do alright though, as the enemies aren't particularly strong by themselves. I thought it was very good!

## 41 [PocketWraith on July 5, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/181044-wastes-of-eriador-shipping-now/?do=findComment&comment=1681691)

I found it pretty easy solo, though I was lucky in not seeing any of the tougher enemies until I was already somewhat set up. It definitely felt like it would've been more of a challenge with more players though, once the encounter deck started to combo. Also, the Predatory Wolves treachery specifically would be more of an issue with even just one more player - solo I just pulled a Northern Warg every time, but with more players, if you pull multiple Northern Wargs their When Revealed effects stack up, so you might have to take some of the other enemies or actually do the ally discard option.

So yeah, solo easy, multiplayer probably less so.

I am 0-4 against it solo. Are there any obvious strategies I am missing. I try to quest as hard as I can during the day, while trying to pick off wargs, but things tend to pile up in staging.
