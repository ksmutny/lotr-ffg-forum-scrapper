# [Mono Spirit deck for The hills of Emyn Muil?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58877-mono-spirit-deck-for-the-hills-of-emyn-muil/)

Would this scenario be a good fit for a Mono Spirit deck with all available Spirit cards?  It seems tailor made for such a deck. 

Thoughts, comments or complaints?

I think spirit/lore is a much better bet.  mono-spirit will rush through the opening locations.  However, once that happens you willlikely be short of the 20 VP you need to win.  You potentially have a long slog to get those needed locations, and an event deck chalk full of ways to send direct damage at your characters.  with mono-spirit, you are rolling the dice that you have enough cancels and good luck to avoid disasterous draws.  With spirit/lore, you have healing to back your heroes up.

That being said, mono-spirit will probably have a slightly better score than spirit.lore.  But spirit lore will give you a higher win percentage.

Is there anything else besides 3x Rockslide? With 3x Test of Will and Eleanor, you're pretty immune to them. Eowyn, Eleanor, Frodo?

i think its far too easy with mono spirit...i can get about a 80% win rate with it, and compared to the other quests thats a high chance. and yes its tailor made really, as is dead marshes in my opinion

Necromancer's reach, Dol Goldur Orcs and evil storm (though mono spirit shouldn't ever get threat that high).

richsabre gave an 80% win chance with mono-spirit. My spirit lore deck is 6-0 vs that scenario, and its hard to see how I could lose againsr that quest.

 So far, I have never lost against this Emyn Muil. I am using a spirit/lore deck. Mono spirit will certainly work, but if your going for a good score you want to get those locations as early as possible, and for that you really need Denethor. Put an UC or two on him and he will be even better at finding those locations.

Finished my first game of Emyn Muil.  I quite liked it.  I like games which involve travel from location to location so this was a satisfying play experience.  Here were some thoughts about the game.  Played a game with Eowyn, Elanor, and Bilbo.  Here were some thoughts.

Had lots of allies that could discover locations.  So many that it was almost overkill.  It got to the point where I could quest and be guaranteed to not only overcome any threat in the staging area, but also travel over any location I had travelled to.

I also had lots of healing cards.  None of my characters had to worry about lasting damage.

I had my threat under control quite well.

Fighting was a bit tricky.  This was the first time I looked at my Northern trackers as fighters rather than just as scouts.  Same with lots of other Willpower characters.  Individually they did not contribute too much to damage, but together they could swarm over an orc patrol and destroy them.

Elanor and Unexpected courage was very useful.  She could wait for a nasty treachery card, defend against attacks, and then be part of the counter attack.  Matched with defender of Laurien she could defend at 3.  If she suffered any damage there were plenty of healers on standby.

Quick question.  If a Northern Tracker is committed to questing, and puts enough progress tokens on a location to eliminate it.  Does that location still contribute threat the phase he quested?

BY FAR, the most important lesson I learned was the value of  Henemarth Riversong for a solo deck.  The ability to actually SEE the next encounter card and plan accordingly was valuable beyond belief.  It showed the value of having good intelligence rather than just blundering into encounters and hope for the best.   This was a very important lesson and I plan to use a similar deck for other games.

Having bilbo and two Gleowine cards gave me a draw of 4 cards a turn which was an enormous amount of flexibility.

Nope.

Gleowine is Unique so you can only have one of him (her?) in play at a given time.
