Dunland has always been my favorite "evil" faction in Middle-earth, and these Dunland enemies look amazing! I can't wait for this expansion which I think will be my favorite so far!

nice preview....looks to be some great new ideas coming in this pack......i know i say this every time, but i was hoping for some player cards though :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

## 4 [Gizlivadi on November 21, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93849-new-voi-preview/?do=findComment&comment=913403)

Yeah, player cards would've been nice... but if it's only Dunland cards it's totally fine for me! lol

 

What did you think of the art? I always imagined this faction with a very Celtic style (makes sense in the story if the Rohirrim are the Saxons, plus "dun" in gaelic means hill-fort or castle, Dunland then means land of forts) and I like that they kept some of that while also keeping them with an original style.

yes, i like the art depiction also- i cannot remember much from the book about them (its a while since i read TT) byut i think the dunlendings are one of those races where it is pretty clear what they should look like, and i think like this is good.

 

i wonder if they are portrayed as too 'barabarian' though? has anyone any quick quotes from lotr on their description?

These mechanics sound like they are going to be tough. Negative effects for card draw and number of cards in your hand.

Wow, I am really looking forward to this challenge. Glaurung has been talking about limit to hand size, i think the designers have come up with a good strategy to counteract it. They will punish us for it.

## 7 [Karlson on November 21, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93849-new-voi-preview/?do=findComment&comment=913416)

This expansion is really going to alter a lot of people's play style, that's for sure.  I know I enjoy collecting huge hands of player cards and saving up for massive planning rounds in which I take complete control of everything.  No more with those nasty Dunlendings!  

 

Perhaps a couple of the new player cards in this expansion will provide a way to discard existing cards in your hand for certain bonuses such as increased resources or readying effects.  Otherwise, these Dunland enemies will be extremely challenging since we start out with 6 cards right from the get go.

They aren't described in detail. The movies certainly portay them too barbarian-like for me, the depiction Iron Crown did of them is personally the best IMO, but this one isn't too bad. It's a nice balance.

So, there will have some time counter tokens in the box?

## 10 [ricedwlit on November 21, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93849-new-voi-preview/?do=findComment&comment=913464)

Probably not. My guess is that we will be told to place resource tokens on the quest and each one counts as a time counter.

## 11 [Style75 on November 21, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93849-new-voi-preview/?do=findComment&comment=913467)

This sounds really fun and thematic but I wonder how they will address hand size in future expansions? Not all enemies in the future will be from Dunland and to use the same mechanic in other enemy factions would be cheezy. This appears to be a patch fix (albeit a fun and flavorful one) to a problem with game mechanics that will only get worse as more player cards are released over time. I fear a hand limit is inevitable and then this cycle will lose much of its teeth. I will, however, enjoy this cycle greatly as Rohan is one of my favorite factions and Saruman one of my favorite bad guys.

## 12 [Gizlivadi on November 21, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93849-new-voi-preview/?do=findComment&comment=913479)

That is an excellent point. I guess I unconsciously made the same assumption when reading the article. This is pretty much a patch solution to the hand size problem, but it's clear the designers know and are aware of the lack of a hand limit in the game, and I think that if they plan on doing a hand limit they would have it in mind when making these scenarios. And I think that while this particular quest will be much easier with a hand limit (and not really that much easier, a 20 attack dunlending is pretty much the same as, say, an 8 attack one, you're going to chump anyway) it's gonna be the decks themselves that will suffer the most.

## 13 [GrandSpleen on November 21, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93849-new-voi-preview/?do=findComment&comment=913489)

I wouldn't call this an attempt at a 'fix' in any shape or form since it has no effect on any scenarios without the spoiled cards.  It's just a way to make this scenario uniquely challenging while challenging certain deck types (decks with lots of draw).  In fact, I would call this a hardcore validation of super big hand sizes, a designer's nod to their existence and apparent declaration that there are no plans in place for any sort of limit.  'cuz as Style75 said, that would potentially neuter this scenario.

Sounds like interesting idea. More cards you have more problem you got. So now all this doom draw players cards doesn looks so great anymore…….you got your threat up and enemies attack you also enemies getting stronger…..

I love the idea to make game more fast and bring more actions with a time counters(  yes sure it will be represents by resources tokens on cards) now players will have a more tension trough all the game. this is more then welcome for me.

Hope it will works and we will have amazing box soon!

## 15 [Glaurung on November 21, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93849-new-voi-preview/?do=findComment&comment=913510)

Sounds like Saruman can prevent time counters triggered.  The time counter triggered in the end of refresh phase but Saruman discarded in the end of the round. So if time counter can be on enemies or locations Saruman will prevent it to trigger  and can win one more round for you. 

## 16 [Nickpes on November 21, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93849-new-voi-preview/?do=findComment&comment=913552)

Nice preview ... I believe also that the new mechanism will make the game tough, till some new strategies appear. Also it was about time some new enemies emerge

As for the art, i think , if i remember well, that dunlendings where not meant to be as savage as picts, more or less like british celts, which means they some of them might have armour etc, but overall they look nice :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Wow, so Saruman is very useful and critical.

Maybe this one gets a second chance for when you really need a specific card but can´t afford the big hand:

Depending on how you define "savage", assuming it's the common meaning, picts were anything but savage.

## 20 [ClydeCloggie on November 21, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93849-new-voi-preview/?do=findComment&comment=913746)

First thoughts: "discard & play" decks (which try and get stuff into play from the discard pile) will come to the fore. And Vilya decks of course, which also don't rely on cards in hand to set up.

They do indeed! We can't really know if this is how Tolkien imagined them, but this is probably what he had in mind. The one in the first image is possibly a Dunlending nobleman judging by the clothing, and in Meccg they sometimes just used pictures from history books about celts to depict Dunland.

I was thinking decks that revolved around cheap allies, events, and attachments that could be played immediately without building up the player deck size.

The reason "turtle" decks are so popular is because the newer the quest, the more difficult it is to race through with just heroes. I wouldn't even think about playing a deck with less than 18 allies when you have an enemy that just thumps on you repeatedly. More and more I think this is a pigeon hole card game, meaning designers try to cram specific deck concepts down the players' throats rather than opening up design space. Outlands is a great example. I understand every sphere should have strengths and weaknesses but the way I see this game is in a series of tiers.

Tier 1 - questing. You've got to start off with the ability to quest. This means spirit or dwarves. Playing solo you can and should add in some fighting and healing ability. But questing is how you win.

Tier 2 - fighting. If you have a partner, his or her job is to fight enemies. Where questing heroes and allies is paramount in deck 1 with a nominal amount of combat support, the opposite is true for the second player deck. Sentinel and ranged are key here. A nominal amount of questing support is necessary as backup. Legolas is a must.

Tier 3 - control. You want the third player to be the person countering that third flip. This means a back up bank of cancel cards and threat reduction. Leadership belongs here. Sneak attack and various attachments get you through the game. Better bring Sam and Eleanor if you want to win.

Tier 4 - fighting all the way. This is the deck that is either straight tactics or goes leadership/tactics with the twins + Theodred.

Until we get more high wp heroes, expect the trend to continue.

This is a trend?

I must have missed the memo because I don´t see lore represented and I prefer lore all the way these days.

Lets me better prepare for what is to come and direct encounter deck manipulation is sweet as well.

## 29 [Boris_the_Dwarf on November 22, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93849-new-voi-preview/?do=findComment&comment=914792)

The trend being turtling with lots of allies.

I also use lore. Both my tier 1 and tier 2 decks include lore cards. Check out my solving the game thread in the strategy section for more info.

I would think we should see an annoucement for both soon, looking at the hobbit expansions, on the doorstep was announced roughly a month after over hill and under hill was released so we are right in that time frame now for The Road Darkens.

 

The against the shadow packs started getting previews about a month BEFORE HoN released so it really depends on when VoI comes out now that it was pushed back.  Could be January, could be March (boy would that be rough..)
