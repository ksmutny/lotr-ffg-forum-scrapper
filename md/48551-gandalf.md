 Just a though. In all the deck experimentation i have done, i have yet to consider not including gandalf in the deck. SO is there anyone out there that has or doesnt use gandalf in their decks?

 At this point, Gandalf is just too good to not put in a deck. I play with my wife a lot and we have copies of Gandalf in both of our decks.

 it crossed my mind that fantasy flight should offer a print and play thing for cards from the core set. that way we can by another set of gandalfs instead of a whole core set (pr two) like i did. just a thought

As Aragorn said:

The dark lord has nine. But we have one mightier than they:the white rider.He has passed through the fire and the abyss and they shall fear him.We will go where he leads.

So no. Don't ever think to leave your home if Gandalf is not with you lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif].

I think that is a great idea. I would buy cards from FFG if they did that. They just print what people buy. As it is, I bought some singles from an online retailer to finish my set of uncommons and get three more Gandalfs. That way each deck can have some Gandalf love.

Good fun read. I have yet to consider exclusion of Gandalf as well. Not that I always wait for him in my games, there are ofter cards I crave for even more but overall I'd still consider him all-time most essential card.

## 8 [lleimmoen on June 19, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/48551-gandalf/?do=findComment&comment=487570)

I really wonder why they didn't name him Gandalf the Grey and thus left a little window of possibility for future expansions and their White version. It could be fun to consider which version to play, of even if both...

## 9 [Mestrahd on June 19, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/48551-gandalf/?do=findComment&comment=487644)

I think you answered your own question. If they named him Gandalf the Grey, and then came out with a Gandalf the White, they would not be unique to each other meaning you could play both. By just naming them Gandalf, you couldn't have any two versions out at once.

## 10 [jesseolivier2 on June 19, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/48551-gandalf/?do=findComment&comment=487650)

 yeah they still could come out with a gandalf the white..

Since the game is supposed to take place between Bilbo's 111th birthday and Frodo leaving the Shire, I don't see how Gandalf the White could make an appearance.

I think you're missing the point. The core set scenarios are supposed to take place during the time span, I can't see they stick to that for good. But maybe they will and then I'll be missing the point.

You think they would have two cards of the same name? Maybe but I doubt it. If they later come up with the White, its text could take care of things...

I don't think that this timeframe will change. As in "Middle Earth Quest" this period was chosen for specific reasons:

a) It allows designers to develop and players to explore middle-earth during a time, where there is a certan freedom from the LotR-books, while you can still meet most of the important characters and give the illusion, that you are working towards the events in LotR.
If you set games is at the same time as the LotR, you either follow the main character, which means that you can only re-tell the original story, or you follow new, independent characters, which means, the actions of the players are diminished by those of the BIG ONES (Frodo and company). Both of these twp options have been done to death.

b) I also assume, that it is a question of licensing. I guess, that the licensing agreement with the Tolkien estate specifically states, that FFG can only make games set in this period. But that is just a guess.

Of course: Never say never, but I am quite sure that LotR:TCG will stay in this timeframe.

They don't have a "version" line on their card template, so the actual name of the card would have been "Gandalf The Grey" or "Gandalf The White" which would be non-unique to each other since the names don't match.

A Game of Thrones LCG has a lot of unique characters with multiple versions. I don't see why LotR should be different.

Game of Thrones also has cards which have to be discraded if you control other cards (the same person by a different name) - Cat of the Canals, Arstan Whitebeard etc.

MECCG used to have Manifestations, cards with different names depicting the same unique character. For most of them, if one was in play you couldn't play another one, but for some it meant you could play the new one and the old one had to be discarded. So you could replace Strider with Aragorn, and if your opponent had The Mouth in play as a character you could play the Mouth of Sauron hazard card to force him to take The Mouth back to his hand.

It's not that difficult to include different versions of the same character in a game.
