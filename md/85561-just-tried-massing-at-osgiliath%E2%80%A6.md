…and got completely slaughtered.

I know this is supposed to be a hard quest, but wow!

So is the idea to start with threat below 27, so that you don't get blitzed on the first turn?

Could try playing a chump ally, quest with 2 heroes, suicide the ally at the wolf, go undefended on the little guy and then swing back and kill the little guy with your remaining ally.  should make turn 2 a little easier.  that quest is FUN with 4 people.  the board is just, EFUWEHFGEWFGhewuht34uth34grg

I was playing 2 handed.  So, 2 wolves and 2 snagas.  Total threat in staging area was 8 (as opposed to 4 in solo).  Eowyn can handle 4 by herself so I can see how solo might be easier at least in terms of the first turn.  Hmm…  

The main problem with the chump strategy is that the wolves would go back to the encounter deck.  And those big scouts would raise threat.  Hmm…

Lots of Hmming for this scenario!

Osgiliath is one of my favourite scenarios. It's tough but quite beatable once you get a feel for the adventure. Getting rid of the initial wolves ASAP should be your top priority, either sacrificing an ally or blocking and killing if you have that sort of deck. This quest is not threat critical so don't worry about failing to quest at the beginning. There are no mass killing effects so try to get out some allies quickly before you are forced to discard them by "cut off".

Have fun!

i love osgilliath, i usually take my hama/beorn/legolas deck against it with a questing deck

beorn really helps as he can take on the snaga no problem, and hama can recycle feint/thicket of spears.

those two cards are key here. get legolas a few blade are you are set
