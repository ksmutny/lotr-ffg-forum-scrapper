...so that they don't roll off of the table and under the stove.

That is all.

Why are you playing on top of your stove?

edit: Missed the part where you said they rolled off the table. Time to practice my reading skills...

Ooh! That's a good idea for more tense/thematic gameplay if we ever get quests to Mount Doom in Mordor!

Toe nail clippers for the win!

We stopped using the tokens after the first few plays. Now we use white D6 fo resources and red D6 for wounds. Much easier and less irritating to keep bagged up at the end of the game or rolling off the table.

 When I got my copy of the Core Set at Kubla Con, I went ahead and supplemented it by getting three bags of crystal tokens: Gold for resources, Red for wounds, and Purple for progress. Since I have also gotten into Call of Cthulhu and A Game of Thrones, I have been able to use those tokens for those games as well (the cardboard ones felt tacky, and I couldn't stand their progress tokens!)

We use colored beads that correspond to the sphere colors...less chance of using resources incorrectly

Good ideas you all!  I prefer to use the tokens supplied in the box, and instead of triangular, would that tokens were square. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
