first proper try at the beginner quest, i lost, just, with the leadership deck.  I got to the last stage of the quest and dealt 3 hit point on ungoliants spawn, but i kept drawing locations which even exhausting all my characters to fight against it, it still added to my  threat up to 50. Oh well, pretty pleased for first attempt, very enjoyable game

Was your threat close to 50? The most popular tactic to defeat this scenario is to ignore questing, if you can spare the threat points, and throw as much as you can at the Spawn and kill it quickly, since it wins you the game.

yes i considered this as the only way of winning however, come my last turn my threat was 46! so no chance
