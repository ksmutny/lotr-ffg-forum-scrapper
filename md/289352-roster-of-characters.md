While listening to LOTR audio while traveling, I started wondering how many named characters (especially with dialogue) don't yet have cards in the game.Â  So I thought I'd take a systematic approach and look at them chapter by chapter.Â  With one post per day I could get through the entire work in less than two months.Â  I'll put a * symbol by those that have dialogue, and put a bracket around those who are dead/departed by 3001 (year of Bilbo's Party).Â  Names are listed in order of appearance, and cards spoiled but not released are included.

I:1 A Long Expected Party

*Bilbo Baggins (2 saga heroes, LoÂ Hero, Ta Hero, Sp Ally)

*Frodo Baggins (4 saga heroes, Sp Hero)

[Old Took]

*Ham (Gaffer) Gamgee (Lo Ally)

*Sam Gamgee (Le Hero, Sp Ally)

*Old Noakes

*Daddy Twofoot

[Drogo Baggins]

[Primula Bandybuck]

[Old Master Gorbadoc Brandybuck]

*Sandyman the miller

[Holman Gamgee]

*Gandalf (N hero, two Ne allies)

*Otho Sackville-Baggins

*Lobelia Sackville-Baggins

*Odo Proudfoot

Everard Took

Melilot Brandybuck

*Rory Brandybuck

*Gollum/Smeagol (two objective allies, one objective, three enemies)

Adelard Took

Dora Baggins

Milo Burrows

Angelica Baggins

Hugo Bracegirdle

*Merry Brandybuck (Sp Hero, Ta Hero)

Sancho Proudfoot

Those without cards never left the shire, though I'd like to see Lobelia getting a card for whacking ruffians with her umbrella.Â  Merry needs an ally version, and both Frodo and Sam deserve another hero version.

Odo Proudfoot should have a Lore ally that lets you draw a card every time you explore a location to represent his "Proudfeet".

## 3 [banania on January 17, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/289352-roster-of-characters/?do=findComment&comment=3594876)

This clearly shows we need a whole cycle in the Shire.

## 4 [Gizlivadi on January 17, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/289352-roster-of-characters/?do=findComment&comment=3594926)

Yep, and coincidentally a cycle in the Shire could lead us to the White Towers (which also coincidentally appear in the art for Gildor hero, who could come out next cycle), which hold a palantir and thus it could tie in to a theme of wizards and artifacts. (Did I already say ARTIFACTS?)

This is a great idea!

Very thorough

## 6 [dalestephenson on January 18, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/289352-roster-of-characters/?do=findComment&comment=3595800)

I:2 The Shadow of the Past

Folco Boffin (Lo hero)

*Fredegar Bolger (Sp hero)

*Peregrin Took (Lo hero, Sp hero)

*Ted Sandyman

Hal Gamgee (Le ally)

*Saruman the White (enemy, N ally)

Sauron the Great

[Gil-Galad]

[Elendil]

[Isildur]

[*Deagol]

*Aragorn (three saga heroes, Le hero, Lo hero, Ta hero)

[Acalagon the Black]

Thoughts -- we need a Saruman hero and a SpAragorn to complete the collection.Â  I credited Sauron with no dialogue, though he has some in the Silmarillion.Â  I do think it ironic that in a card game entitled "The Lord of the Rings", that the Lord of the Rings himself has no card at all.

The inclusion of Acalagon is because I consider named creatures to be "characters" for the purpose of the list, though that mostly just affects mounts.

I'm pretty sure that the next cycle will takes place in the Shire.

FFG, or at least Caleb and Matt likes patterns.

First pattern:Â 

All of the FFG created heroes were out in the 2d or / and in 5th AP of each cycle. (except for Khaliel)

Cycle 3 : Deluxe Main faction -> Gondor

AP 2: Mirlonde (Silvan)

AP 5: Caldara (Gondor)

Cycle 4:Â  Deluxe Main faction -> Â  Rohan

AP 2: Idraen (Dunedain)

Cycle 5 :Â Deluxe Main faction ->Â  Dunedain

AP 2: Rossiel (Silvan)

AP 5: Amathiul (Dunedain)

Cycle 6:Â Deluxe Main faction ->Â  Noldor

AP 2: Lanwyn (Dale)

AP 5: Na 'Assiyah (Corsair)

Cycle 7:Â Deluxe Main faction -> Silvan / DwarfÂ 

AP 1: Kahliel (Harad)

AP 2: Thurindir (Dunedain)

Cycle 8:Â Deluxe Main faction -> Dale

AP 2: Haldan (Woodman)

Â 

Second pattern, there is a FFG created hero related to the current cycle faction in eachÂ cycle (except the 4th cycle...).

Cycle 3: Caldara (Gondor)

Cycle 5:Â Amathiul (Dunedain)

Cycle 6: Na 'Assiyah (Corsair)

Cycle 7: Kahliel (Harad)

Cycle 8: Haldan (Woodman)

Â 

Third patternÂ there is a link between hero of AP 2 and AP 5 and the nextÂ cycle (or the following).

Cycle 1 AP 5Â Boromir (Gondor)Â --> Cycle 3 Gondor

Cycle 4 AP 2Â Idraen (Dunedain) --> Cycle 5 Dunedain

Cycle 4 AP 5 Galadriel (Noldor) --> Cycle 6 Noldor

Cycle 5 AP 2Â Â Rossiel (Silvan) --> Cycle 7 Silvan / Dwarf

Cycle 6 AP 2Â Lanwyn (Dale) --> Cycle 8 DaleÂ 

Â 

Cycle 7 AP 2Â Thurindir (Dunedain) --> Cycle 9 Dunedain ?Â 

Cycle 7 AP 5Â Floco (Hobbit) --> Cycle 9 Hobbit ?Â 

Cycle 8 AP 5Â Bilbo (Hobbit) --> Cycle 9 Hobbit ?Â 

Â 

So for me it's obvious:

Cycle 9 will be either a Dunedain or a Hobbit cycle. We already went to Arnor, so i'll bet we will discover the Shire in the next cycle.

One correct -- Folco Boffin is *not* an FFG-created hero.Â  The four friends who helped Frodo prepare for his move to Crickhollow were Merry, Pippin, Fatty, and Folco.Â  Folco evidently lived close to Hobbiton, because on the day they left Folco went home after lunch and that's the last we hear from him.Â  The reference in chapter two is after mentioning Frodo's "many friends" -- Folco and Fredegar are named as "two of these", but Merry and Pippin are singled out as his closest friends.

Correct. Thanks

I'll edit my post. That doesn't change my point though, AP 5 of cycle 7 and cycle 8 are still Hobbit Heroes. ^^

Â 

We never been to Edoras in any scenario of the game. We went to Cairn Andros, Minas Tirith, Isengard, Bree etc..., but never in Edoras ðŸ˜ž

I wish we will go there in some scenario. Maybe in cycle 10 in 2022. ^^

So far there are no invented (either ally or hero) Hobbits, Noldor, Beornings, Eagles, Outlands, or Esgaroth.

## 11 [GILLIES291 on January 18, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/289352-roster-of-characters/?do=findComment&comment=3595957)

Great lists! Would also love to see some Shire action. Either as a new story or as a "final saga pack" that contains Burning of the Shire and the whole counter attack over three missions and with new Sam/Frodo heroÂ characters and Merry/Pippin allies.Â 

That or Mordor, Mordor would be sweet.

In the digital game there is now Tom Took...

## 13 [dalestephenson on January 18, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/289352-roster-of-characters/?do=findComment&comment=3596040)

Haven't really played the digital game, despite getting the collector's edition -- is there new artwork for Tom Took that might show up in our game?

I do wonder *why* they would invent a Took, when there's so many existing Tooks available in appendix C.

## 14 [Authraw on January 18, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/289352-roster-of-characters/?do=findComment&comment=3596118)

They reused some Treachery art for Tom, if I recall. And I have no idea why they felt compelled to invent their own Hobbit when there are *so many* named Hobbits in the books.

## 15 [banania on January 18, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/289352-roster-of-characters/?do=findComment&comment=3596127)

One strong argument for the next cycle being Hobbit is that the past few cycles always have had cards sort of "announcing" development to come (the Beorning Guardian and Knight of Dale in past cycle), and we start seeing Hobbits in AP5 of this cycle.

Furthermore, there is Tom Cotton.

That guy boosts Hobbit allies when they enter play, but there are not much Hobbit allies to choose from right? And the Raise the Shire event is bound to raise no one if you don't have Hobbit in your deck...

The player card development has been very consistent this past few years, so I'm sure we're bound for a massive injection of Hobbit cards coming soon.

Finally, it's a Lord of the Rings game, and we haven't had yet a Deluxe centered on Hobbits. How silly does that actually sound?

There are 10 Hobbit allies total [https://ringsdb.com/find?q=k%3AHobbit+t%3Aally], of which 6 are unique [https://ringsdb.com/find?q=k%3AHobbit+t%3Aally+u%3Atrue&sort=name&view=list]. So that means there are only 4 non-unique Hobbit allies [https://ringsdb.com/find?q=k%3AHobbit+t%3Aally+u%3A0] in the game right now.

In contrast, there are 16 Hobbit heroes [https://ringsdb.com/find?q=k%3AHobbit+t%3Ahero&sort=name&view=list]Â (10 playable outside of Sagas) representing 8 unique characters: Bilbo, Fatty, Folco, Frodo, Merry, Pippin, Sam, and Tom.

I love the idea of the shire being the next setting but there are so many amazing hobbit cards that it feels tough to fit them all in one deck. It would probably stress me out to get a whole cycles worth on top of what we have. There are so many auto includes I have trouble cutting down to a reasonable deck. I do agree and have also observed that most of the small amount of non unique allies for hobbits are not strong.Â 

We could see a thain title attachmentÂ

I:3 Three is Company

*Elrond Halfelven (Lo hero, Lo ally)

Lotho Sackville-Baggins

[Elbereth Gilthoniel]

*Gildor Inglorion [boon ally, Le hero, Lo ally]

This chapter is also where we meet the Black Riders, but they are not named, nor except for the Witch-King are they ever distinguished.

## 19 [Amicus Draconis on January 20, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/289352-roster-of-characters/?do=findComment&comment=3597903)

While not in the Lord of the Rings itself, Tolkien named the one NazgÃ»l in Bag's End KhamÃ»l the Easterling according to Unfinished Tales and he even got his own card in the Nightmare deck.

## 20 [dalestephenson on January 20, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/289352-roster-of-characters/?do=findComment&comment=3597917)

I:4 A Short Cut to Mushrooms

*Farmer Maggot (Ta ally)

Grip

Fang

Wolf

*Mrs. Maggot

No first name is given in the text for either of the Maggots.Â  The dogs are large and ferocious, and well-trained, and probably would be useful allies against non-Nazgul enemies.

I:5 A Conspiracy Unmasked

[Gorhendad Oldbuck/Brandybuck]

No new (living) characters were introduced in this chapter.

## 22 [Flrbb on January 22, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/289352-roster-of-characters/?do=findComment&comment=3599670)

If you buy LotR as a book(s), you'll have an index of all characters and on which pages they appear. That should shorten your work. But it depends on the print version if it has such index.

True.Â  Bit i personally love the way he is doing this on a daily / chapter base. I spend some time every evening to check the book for information on the lesser known characters...Â 

## 24 [dalestephenson on January 22, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/289352-roster-of-characters/?do=findComment&comment=3599687)

I do have a printed book, and proceeding alphabetically through the index would reduce the chance I miss a character in the text.Â  But I think order of appearance is more interesting, and I think that's easier to do working through the text than through the index.Â  It also lets me separate characters with dialogue from those that do not more easily.

## 25 [dalestephenson on January 22, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/289352-roster-of-characters/?do=findComment&comment=3599714)

I:6 The Old Forest

Old Man Willow (enemy)

*Tom Bombadil

*Goldberry

Bombadil does have a boon associated with him, but no ally.Â  Like Sauron, his power level is not comparable with anything we have in the game, so any card would underrate him.

True. Better for him to appear in a very powerful event form maybe neutral,limit 1 per deck as a group and going into the victory display.

I:8 Fog on the Barrow-Downs

Sharp-ears

Wise-nose

Swish-tail

Bumpkin

White-socks

Fatty Lumpkin

*Barliman Butterbur (Lo ally)

We have one named pony in the game, but I doubt Fatty Lumpkin or any of Merry's five renamed ponies will ever make the cut.

I:9 At the Sign of the Prancing Pony

*Harry Goatleaf

*Nob

*Bob

Will Whitfoot

*Mr. Mugwort

Harry didn't make the enemy cut for Knife in the Dark, and also failed to be a suspect in the murder mystery.Â  We also have four more named hobbits (though only the Mayor has both first and last names).Â  Nob and Bob are at least helpful enough in the main narrative to warrant ally cards.

Thanks to Sam and Strider, we are introduced to eight great names from the past, but only Beren is given actual dialogue in a poem, and that's merely "Tinuviel!Â Tinuviel!"Â  We also meet Bill the Pony, but he's not named yet.Â  Melkor/Morgoth is referred to, but not named.

Between the text and the appendices, FFG has the rings to use a lot of pre-LOTR content.

I:12 Flight to the Ford

*Tom

*Glorfindel (Lo hero, Sp hero, Sp ally)

Tom is fictional in LOTR, Sam making him up on the spot, but he has dialogue in Sam's song along with the unnamed trolls.Â  We also meet the three Trolls from the Hobbit (sort of), but they are named here.Â  Glorfindel is well represented in the game, unlike how he's treated in movie versions.

II:1 Many Meetings

*Arwen (Sp hero, Sp ally, objective ally)

*Gloin (Le hero, Le ally)

[*Thorin Oakenshield] (Le hero)

Grimbeorn the Old (Ta hero, objective ally)

[*Beorn] (Ta hero, Ta ally) I'm assuming death before 3001

[*Bard the Bowman] (Ta hero) d.2977

Bain son of Bard, d. 3007

Brand son of Bain (Le hero, Ta hero)

*Dain Ironfoot (Le hero, Sp hero)

*Dwalin (Sp hero, Sp ally)

*Dori (Ta hero, Lo ally)

*Nori (Sp hero)

*Bifur (Lo hero, Lo ally)

*Bofur (Sp ally, Ta ally)

*Bombur (Lo hero, Lo ally)

[*Balin] (Le hero)

[*Ori] (Lo hero)

[*Oin] (Sp hero)

Elladan (Ta hero, Lo ally)

*Elrohir (Le hero, Sp ally)

*Lindir (Sp ally)

While it's a shame that all the dwarves don't have both hero and ally versions, the named characters here are well represented, except for poor Bain son of Bard who died 6 years after the party, yet becomes the lone named Barding to be left out of the game.Â  Maybe later.

I've got to say that Lindir's art, combined with the flavor text, makes him look like an arrogant jerk to me.Â  But he actually gave that line laughing and was the lone elf to actually ask to hear Bilbo's poem again, so he deserves to be remembered fondly (by Bilbo, at least).

The Watcher in the Water (two enemies)

The four named are dwarves of Balin's company, perishing before Bilbo's farewell feast.Â  If the designers decided to use the full period between Hobbit and LOTR, they would have more characters available to them.

[Amroth]

Either Rumil or Orophin was likely the unnamed elf that said "Yrch!" to Frodo -- most likely Rumil, as Orophin went off in haste to warn of the orcs.Â  The Lord and Lady of the Galadhrim are referred to in this chapter (especially the Lady), but not yet named.

*Ugluk (enemy)

*Grishnakh (enemy)

Lugdush

Mauhur

The scout that reports the lone rider is called Snaga by Ugluk, and it is capitalized as if it were a proper name, but Snaga is the orcish for slave, and Snaga appears as a non-unique enemy card in Treason of Saruman (three copies).Â  The two orcs with dialogue get their own enemy cards, but Lugdush and Mauhur are left out of their only opportunity for glory.

Leaflock (Lo ally)

Skinbark (Ta ally)

[Wandlimb]

*Quickbeam (Ta hero, Lo ally)

Orofarne

Lassemista

Carnimirie

I am using the common speech version of Ent names here, but not the Elvish; although Treebeard himself uses the Elvish versions more often (e.g. Fimbrethil instead of Wandlimb].Â  I'm also assuming the three last are names of specific Rowan trees and not just untranslated Elvish/Entish words.

This chapter is also (I believe) the first place the Old Took's given name, Gerontius, is given.Â  His parents were prophetic!

The initial guard at the gate has dialogue, but is not named.Â  I am speculating that Galmod, father of Grima, is not alive during the period of the game, but it could easily be otherwise.Â  He would be an unlikely choice for an ally in any case.Â  His son has the singular distinction of being an objective ally, a hero, and an enemy.

These three names are noticeable Quenya names meaning "mountain-dwelling" "leaf-grey" andÂ  "with adornment of red jewels" respectively. Tolkien wrote this in letter 168.

Elfhelm does not speak in this chapter, but does later.Â  He has the singular distinction of having two different ally versions and also a hero version.Â  Saradoc and Paladin deserve their own cards as they were the Master of Buckland and the Thain at the time of the game, Thain Paladin was already fighting the ruffians when the four hobbits of the fellowship returned to raise the shire.

IV: 1 The Taming of Smeagol

Uncle Andy (Gamgee?)

I'm cheating a bit here, he was mentioned in Lothlorien for the first time but I missed him -- this is his second appearance.Â  The Longfather-Tree of Master Samwise lists him as Andwise Roper of Tighfield, born 1323 S.R. with no death date listed.Â  Sam's grandfather Hobson was known as Roper Gamgee, but as a third generation roper I wonder if Andy simply went by Roper instead of Gamgee, as Sam's own son became a Gardner.Â  Sam refers to Andy in this chapter in the past tense ("him that was the Gaffer's eldest brother"), but at only 78 at the time of Bilbo's party was likely living during the period of the game, if perhaps no longer rope-walking.Â  It's interesting that Sam calls him Gaffer's "eldest brother", when "elder brother" would sufficiently distinguish him from Halfred, Gaffer's younger brother.

I agree.Â  When you ally core version is definetely far better than your two hero version something is wrong

That's mostly because the ally version is widely applicable, whereas the heroes are key players only in particular decks (e.g. Ents for Leadership Faramir) or particular circumstances (e.g. Battle questing for Lore Faramir). But in those circumstances they can be very impressive indeed.

LeFaramir is useful in a LeFaramir/Bifur/Mablung Ents deck, and LoFaramir is good for battle questing and in a trap deck, but he's not a staple for either Ents or traps.Â  I want a Faramir that makes me say "wow", difficult as that is to do with 2/2/2/5Â stats.

I know I'm late to the party, but I want to nerd out andÂ get you the names of the Ring-Wraiths.

They were named by the Middle Earth CCG and it was my understanding that there was some point where the names were considered canon. I don't think they actually are/were.Â Spelling could be off but here goes:

Witch-King of Angmar

Khamul the Easterling

Dwar of Waw

Adunaphel the Silent

Akhorahil the Seer

Ren the Unclean

Uvatha the Horseman

Indur Dawndeath

Hoarmurath of Dir

Great topic, interesting to see who is left. Also enjoying the speculation on where the game goes next. Now if only things would get back in stock! I've got a lot of catching up to do!

In the canonical text, none of the Nazgul are identified by name, and the only the Witch-King of Angmar (a title, not a name) is singled out.Â  Khamul the Easterling is named by Tolkien in Unfinished Tales.Â  I don't know if the other seven names were invented by MECG or borrowed from some other inventor, but they are not from Tolkien.Â  Gothmog takes over the battle of Pellenor Fields after the Witch-King falls, but Tolkien does not specify what sort of creature he is, some speculate that he too was as Nazgul.Â  I speculate that he is Nazgul simply because other Nazgul were present and no other being could as effectively lead according to Sauron's will--however, the name is recycled from a first age Balrog, so a fallen spirit in Sauron's service would be an appropriate fit for the name.Â  An orc-general (such as in Peter Jackson's film) seems most unlikely to me.

Sorry if I wasn't clear on this, the names were absolutely invented for the Middle Earth CCG by the game's producer, Iron Crown Enterprises. They had a solid lock on the license until they went bankrupt.

I'm trying to remember what made me think that the names were "canon" for awhile;Â My best guess is that at the same time Decipher was making the Star Wars CCG (speaking of other FFG licenses haha) and they did have that deal, so it's very possible I just assumed that Iron Crown had that deal in place too. I know what they say about assuming but I was a kid at the time.

At least the game named the other two Wizard better than they did the Nazgul! Alatar and Pallando. It is some fun unofficial fluff at least.

Â 

EDIT: Actually, I think possibly Tolkien named the other two wizards, but those are the names he used. Memory is a bit hazy on how it ties in and what he did and didnâ€™t do with them. They went east and southÂ and didnâ€™t come back.

Alatar and Pallando are named in Unfinished Tails, too.

I quite liked the interpretation of Lord of the Rings Online, that Gothmog was a wraith, non lesser than EÃ¤rnur, wo rode to Minas Morgul challenged by the Witch-king. This also made a nice plot-twist, that EÃ¤rnur in form of Gothmog returns to Minas Tirith as the last King of Gondor to reclaim his throne. Of course this is not canon.

Baranor

Targon

Iorlas

*Bergil

Forlong the Fat (Le ally)

Dervorin

Duinhir

Duilin

Derufin

Golasgil

Hirluin the Fair (Le hero)

Bergil is the most memorable of those without cards, though the greatest among them IMO is Ecthelion II, sadly deceased before Bilbo's party.Â  A great and far-sighted Steward was he.Â  But there's a lot of potential unique allies here known to be living here.Â  OK, there's one exception -- Baranor is the father of Beregond and may not be still living -- Bergil refers to his grandsire living in Lossarnach, but he has two grandsires and Beregond himself gives no hint he's not native to Minas Tirith.Â  Bergil says the 29-year-old Pippin is "as old as my uncle Iorlas", so it'd be surprising if Iorlas did not take part in the war of the ring.Â  And Targon belongs to the Third Company of the Citadel so is well worth a card -- logistics is always underappreciated.

But the greatest number of new names, most without cards, are the leaders of the Outlands.Â  I know that Outlands is already a deck in a box, and uniques with the outlands trait would either be unusable outside an outlands deck or overpowered within one, but it seems a shame that these lords that served so valiantly in the battle of Pellenor Fields should be left out of the game.

## 89 [lleimmoen on March 3, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/289352-roster-of-characters/?do=findComment&comment=3638606)

It is a shame. And the mistake came within the handling of the Outlands trait. It is so short-sighted, and so uninteresting for deckbuilding. I do not want to be mean, I say this also in comparison of how well and carefully some other traits have been handled over time. One can certainly make a Silvan deck that is just as strong as Outlands (and I would say stronger) but there are so many options, and not so many obvious inclusions.

Thanks for the correction.Â  Interestingly, Derufin has the Gondor trait, but not the Outlands trait.

I think the best way to handle Outlands uniques would be to give them modest stats, but useful abilities that require exhaustion.Â  This would give you choices on how to use them in an Outlands deck, but make them usable outside those decks.

Great idea. It would be nice to havecthe fundatiom for a more balanced, interesting and variableÂ outlands reebot archetype. Not sure it will ever happen, however.Â 

Which lead me to the consideration that we already have and outland ally working (too much) fine outside oultand decks: ethir swordsman.Â  Let's be honest. Of all the ally we have today,Â  He is the first one that should deserve nerfing.

It's almost illegal to play him outside outlands decks for the sheer power level you get with only 2 spirit resource and no deckbuilding restriction. He should have 0 native willpower or not buff himself to be a balanced card.

Ethir Swordsman is easily the most useful Outlands outside a Outlands deck, but without Anfalas Herdsman he's fragile and he doesn't synergize with any of the other archtypes.Â  He's far less powerful outside an outlands deck than in one, and I can't feel too bad that at least *one* Outlander is useful outside their archtype.

I'm not sure the neglected Outlanders will happen (or perhaps if they do, they'll get Gondor instead of Outlands), but if they ever do they clearly couldn't buff Outlands characters further.Â  But that still leaves some room for design and I think Outlands could use more choices in both deck construction and game play.

For the Outlands uniques, they could also simply not have the Outlands trait and just have Gondor. However, they could have abilities that are beneficial wiithin an outlands deck.

Ex. Resolve only if this character is active. When a unique ally leaves play, you may search the top 5 cards of your draw deck for a nonunique Ally, and add that ally to your hand. Edit: Shuffle your deck.

This would also encourage using more uniques in Outland Decks.

Widfara really deserves a player card, since he was after all the only one to predict the coming of dawn.Â  Theoden said "If you speak truly, Widfara, then may you live beyond this day in years of blessedness!", but the blessedness doesn't even include his own ally card.Â  I'd like to see him as a hero with the scout attribute and some sort of scrying ability.

## 105 [Kjeld on March 11, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/289352-roster-of-characters/?do=findComment&comment=3645468)

Angbor definitely deserves a card. Aragorn calls him "the Fearless" since he is the lone warrior to hold his ground when the Army of the Dead show up with Aragorn at Linhir (on the road to Pelargir to route the Corsairs of Umbar). He later leads a host of 4,000 to defend Minas Tirith while the Host of the West marches to challenge Sauron at the Black Gates, and thus played aÂ key in absentia roleÂ in convincing Imrahil and the Gondorians to agree to Gandalf's plan to distract Sauron's attention while Frodo and Sam head to Mt. Doom.

I think the player card of Tom Cotton is actually depicting his father, as he stands near the fire before the Battle of Bywater. And he clearly has white hair.

## 113 [dalestephenson on March 15, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/289352-roster-of-characters/?do=findComment&comment=3648809)

I agree, which is why I did not credit Young Tom with a card.Â  He's only called Young Tom in the Scouring of the Shire, in Mount Doom Sam refers only to Tom, but he's grouped with Jolly and Nibs while Rosie is their sister, so clearly the younger Tolman Cotton was meant.

Still, there's three more unique hobbits named, two of which were with their Dad at the Battle of Bywater and the third was wielding a pitchfork.Â  They'd also be very appropriate targets for their Dad.

Mrs. Cotton's first name is not given in the main text, but appears in Sam's geneological chart.Â  Sam's little sister married Tom Jr, so Young Tom is his brother-in-law two ways.Â  You could even claim the Gaffer is his sister-in-law's father....

In the scouring of the Shire we learn for the first time that Pippin's father is the Thain of the Shire, making Pippin the prince of halflings if anyone is.Â  To Bergil Pippin refers to Paladin as "my father farms the lands round Whitwell near Tuckborough in the Shire".Â  Bergil would've been more impressed if he knew Pippin's father was the military leader of the Hobbits, and would shortly start shooting ruffians.

Hobbit Chapter 3,Â  A Short Rest

No new characters named.

This chapter gives the first published description of Elrond, but only "Evil things did not come into that valley" hints at his power.Â  The half-elven Elrond is depicted not as a leader of Elves, nor even as an elf himself:

"The master of the house was an elf-friend.... In those days of our tale there were still some people who had both elves and heroes of the North for ancestors, and Elrond, the master of the house was their chief."

From LOTR, the people we know who fit that description are: Elrond, Elrohir, Elladan, Arwen, and all the Dunedain north and south, of which Elrond is *not* the chief.Â  However, Imrahil's elvish blood reminds us that the few known marriages between elf and man is not the entire set.Â  I've always thought "Last Homely House" is on odd description.Â  Surely Elrond's ring-assisted dwelling is not homely?

Elrond himself is described in polyglot fashion:Â  "He was as noble and as fair in face as an elf-lord, as strong as a warrior, as wise as a wizard, as venerable as a king of dwarves, and as kind as summer."

Elrond "hated dragons and their cruel wickedness, and he grieved to remember the ruin of the town of Dale, and its merry bells, and the burned banks of the bright River Running."Â  This implies that Elrond personally saw Dale in its heyday and also its site shortly after ruin.Â  Dale's glory days were relatively short and confined to the rule of Thror in Erebor.Â  I don't think of Elrond as a traveller, rather someone who stayed in Imladris/Rivendell for all the long years of the third age after Sauron's fall.Â  But evidently it was not so.Â  Perhaps Elrond travelling all around middle earth, averting numerous plots with Vilya's help is not so unthematic after all.

## 125 [Onidsen on March 25, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/289352-roster-of-characters/?do=findComment&comment=3656637)

I rather expect that Tolkien wasÂ not using the American sense of the word (which itself is passing out of fashion), meaning ugly or unattractive.

Rather, I expect he used it to mean exactly what the word looks like (which is apparently how it is still used in British English).Â  Having the qualities of a home. Comfortable,Â  welcoming, safe, etc.

Hobbit Chapter 4, Over Hill and Under Hill

[*The Great Goblin] (enemy)

Technically it is a title instead of a name, but since he has his own unique enemy card I've listed him anyways.

We learn in this chapter that while goblins hate Thorin's folk due to the war, they don't especially hate dwarves and have even made alliances in "some parts" with "wicked dwarves".Â  Suppose we'll ever see dwarf enemies in the game?Â  No, Nalir doesn't count.

More remarkable to me is the way that *all* the goblins recognized Biter and Beater.Â  Elrond guessed that those blades have been out of circulation since the fall of Gondolin and had to read the runes to identify them; Gandalf didn't recognize them at all.Â  Yet the goblins recognized both on sight.Â  Goblins multiply, by all appearances much much faster than the elves they mock, even if they have the lifespan of elves (likely IMO), it's remarkable that so many goblins of the misty mountains would be veterans of the few battles involving Gondolin.

Hobbit Chapter 6, Out of the Frying-Pan into the Fire

[*The Lord of the Eagles]

Again this is more of a title, we don't know the name of the Lord of the Eagles, or for that matter if he were around at the time between the party and the fellowship.Â  Gwaihir is clearly leading the Eagles then, assuming it's the same exact group of eagles, which it might not be (the Lord had no less than fifteen chieftains).Â  But isn't Gwaihir the Lord of the Eagles?Â  Not unless he and Gandalf can't count, since his third bearing of Gandalf in LOTR is referred to as the third time carrying him -- but the Lord of the Eagles bore Gandalf in the pages of the Hobbit.Â  (OK, we know Gandalf can't count from subsequent events, but I assume Gwaihir, like Goblins, can count.)

Another interesting point is Gandalf's remark "I must see if I can't find a more or less decent giant to block [the goblin gate] up again, or soon there will be no getting over the mountains at all".Â  We've seen giants as enemies, but it'd be pretty cool to see a more or less decent giant as a player card.

Hobbit Chapter 8, Flies and Spiders,

No new characters named.

We meet Thranduil in this chapter, though he is not named here.Â  The spiders use no names when addressing each other -- Bilbo calls them names, but they are generic rather than personal.Â  Bilbo in the story has a *much* easier time dispatching spiders than he does in the game.

One interesting thing is that the ring-wearing Bilbo, unseen by the spiders, has his sword seen by them when he slashes the web.Â  It seems odd to me that the Ring would make clothes invisible, but not items held in hand.Â  In the case of the Black Riders, their outer garments are visible.Â  Still, I think we should be grateful that the text doesn't make the hobbits doff their clothesÂ whenever they use the ring.

Still, if it isn't a mistake, then Bilbo's mercy in sparing Gollum also worked in his favor -- if he had drawn his sword to kill the defenseless Gollum, he would have revealed his location and things might have gone badly for him.

What a great catch. I salute you. And I do wonder I have not heard about this one, or indeed thought about it before.Â I guess I assumed the blades were famous but Gandalf does not indeed recognize them on sight.

I always assumed that the blades had entered into Goblin oral tradition, and descriptions of them were passed down through stories or songs. It's clear from Tolkien's writings that the Goblins of the Misty Mountains (and many other orc groups) had culture, and it stands to reason that therefore they would also have stories, too. Biter and Beater likely earned a legendary reputation as part of some Goblin epic tale from the First Age, much like we would hear about the Trojan Horse or Excalibur, perhaps. Keep in mind that cultures with oral traditions could keep very detailed memories alive, as well, so it's not that unlikely that if these swords had become part of the Goblin Legendarium that they would be recognizable from their descriptions. Especially with the tell-tale blue glow. It's also possible that the swords had been in the possession of the Goblins for some time before the trolls got hold of them, so they might have had more recent direct experience with them (like how Elrond kept the shards of Narsil in Rivendell on display for generations).

## 137 [lleimmoen on March 30, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/289352-roster-of-characters/?do=findComment&comment=3662883)

This sounds very logical. I wonder if anyone asked about this in the Letters since these swords are such famous artifacts, mentioned already in an early chapter of the Hobbit though dating all the way to the Silmarillion.

But yes, since the Trolls hadÂ them, they must have been around but out of reach of the Free Peoples, naturally, who would have not lost them again after the Fall of Gondolin (I presume). So the Goblins knew what â€˜evilâ€™ they could do from the tales of old,Â in their ancient oral tradition;Â but they could still see them, perhaps. Maybe the armies of Angmar might have even used them?

Hobbit Chapter 8, Barrels out of Bond

*Galion (Sp ally)

Sadly the butler's key-bearing friend is not named.

Also intriguing is the mention of trade that produces the barrels.Â  "The wine, and other goods, were brought from far away, from their kinsfolk in the South, or from the vineyards of Men in distant lands."Â  We know about kinsfolk to the south in Lorien, but they are an insular lot.Â  Haldir says "..we dwell now in the heart of the forest, and do not willingly have dealings with any other folk.Â  Even our own kindred in the North are sundered from us."Â  This could be a recent development, of course.Â  Celeborn shows they are not completely sundered, "Welcome son of Thranduil!Â  Too seldom do my kindred journey hither from the North."

Anduin is on the opposite side of Mirkwood from Thranduil's halls.Â  It would be interesting to know what route goods from the South took on their way to Thranduil's realm, and what portion of it was done by men rather than elves.

Hobbit Chapter 12, Inside Information

[Girion, Lord of Dale]

[King Bladorthin]

Girion has his necklace in the game, but poor King Bladorthin's spears are forgotten.Â  I wonder what kingdom he was from.

I think Tolkien might have thought again about Bladorthin and discardedÂ the idea.

Ok, check Encyclopedia of Arda, if you havenâ€™t and are interested. But it says very little. The most interesting information given, perhaps, that Bladorthin was first a name reservedÂ for Gandalf.

Hopefully Bladorthin is not just a coarse pun.Â  I've seen speculation that Bladorthin was lord of Dorwinion -- if Caleb has seen the same speculation, we may yet see some reference to him in the next cycle.

I asked about BladorthinÂ some years ago in a swedish Tolkien forum, and they suspected Dorwinion.Â

I just love the idea of an Elven-king that has had too much to drink (Dorwinion was known for its strong wine) and forgets to collect his commissions! :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] The Dwarves of Erebor must have felt rather smug.

I just read a really good argument for why Bladorthin had to have been the human king of Dorwinion. I don't recall you wrote the essay, but there's a link to it on Tolkien Gate.

Hobbit Chapter 14, Fire and Water

No new characters named.Â  This is the first we hear the Thrush speak, but like the Master of Esgaroth, is not named.

Hobbit Chapter 15, The Gathering of the Clouds

[Carc]

[*Roac]

Carc and his wife were a famous pair, but only Carc is named.Â  I am assuming that the aged Roac is deceased by the time of Bilbo's party.Â  In the hobbit not only the Eagles have human-level intelligence, but also spiders, wolves, thrushes and ravens.Â  Roac in particular is far wiser than Thorin.

Sometimes I wondered what did the Professor actually think of Thorin. Because he really gives him a large rangeÂ of character colour. Sometimes he seems just outright silly and sometimes quite wise, and not only through his actions but also per text description.

Hobbit Chapter 17, The Clouds Burst

[Nain]

[Bolg] (enemy)

Tolkien served in WWI and wrote the Hobbit between the wars, so I find Bilbo's reaction to the Battle of Five Armies curious:

"It was a terrible battle.Â  The most dreadful of all Bilbo's experiences, and the one which at the time he hated most--which is to say it was the one he was most proud of, and most fond of recalling long afterwards, although he was quite unimportant in it."

That completes the Hobbit.Â  On to the supplementary materials.

A giant hero would be awesome! Would be interesting to have tons of hitpoints, 0 willpower and defenseÂ high attack and for an ability just have Toughness 2.

Â 

Also on the note of Eagles, we need an Eagle Hero!

Prologue

[Isengrim the Second]

[Marcho Fallohide]

[Blanco Fallohide]

[Argeleb II]

[Findegil]

[Barahir]

Isengrim II was the father of Bandaboras Took.Â  Marcho and Blanco were the brothers who first colonized the Shire and are called "Fallohide brothers", however Fallohide was also the name of one of the three branches of hobbits, so it's possible that they did not use Fallohide as a surname and Tolkien is only identifying their branch with this description.Â  Argeleb II is the king that gave them permission to colonize.

The other two names come from after the war of the ring; Findegil was a Gondorian scribe who finished a copy of the Red Book of Westmarch in FA 172, along with Bilbo's Translation from the Elvish and an abrigement of the story of Aragorn and Arwen originally written by Barahir, grandson of Faramir, the final new name listed in the prologue.

- Otho & Lobelia Sackville-Baggins

- Grip, Fang and Wolf (we are getting Loyal Hound soon)

- Tom Bombadil & GoldberryÂ 

- Nob & Bob

Dale:

-Â Bain son of Bard
