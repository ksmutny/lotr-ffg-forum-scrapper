So, we've just been introduced to a brand new mechanic which will debut with the Lost Realm expansion, presumably.  The idea that we can shuffle player cards into the encounter deck to have them pop up later - possibly more than once - is at the very least intriguing, I'd say.  This is an extension of a mechanic we saw in Heirs of Numenor with Celador and the Ithilien Guardians - allies hiding out among the enemy, waiting to spring their ambushes and help out the quest in their own time.

 

This new mechanic bends the rules of the game a bit in that we will see a form of player card printed up with an encounter card backing, designed to be used in a different way.  This also we've seen in reverse with Mugash and his guards hiding out among player cards.

 

So this Encounter mechanic adds itself to the list of rule additions which make this game so interesting and unique.  In fact, you could say that this game is about the bending of rules.  We've come a long way since quests like Passage Through Mirkwood represented "the norm".  Most scenarios now introduce conditions which fundamentally alter the flow of the game by imposing new victory conditions, alternate ways of making progress, and even manipulating the game board by splitting the encounter and player decks.  It is largely the rulebending that challenges our deckbuilding and makes each scenario feel fresh and rewarding.

 

My question to the community is this:  What future mechanics can you envision for this game that would shake things up and extend playability through future expansions?

 

One creative member on these boards thought up a corruption mechanic not too long ago which I think answers this question very well.  What else can you come up with?

 

Note: this is not a prediction of the future direction of the game, but rather a chance to ignite the imaginations of those creative fans who enjoy making their contributions through this forum.

I wanted to (but got too lazy in the end) make a quest where you pick a faction you're going to support and then remove all representatives of this faction from the encounter deck. I was going to make a Kin Strife quest, where you pick either side of Castamir or Eldacar (or third neutral side, which I was going to take out of my head lol), and by siding with one of them, you get an unique objective ally and attachment belonging to the side you chose, and remove all enemies and treacheries belonging to the side you chose from the encounter deck. Meaning the game experience varies greatly depending on the people you side with. Not so much of mechanic, though.

There was a lot of idea around "location" played by players, the ideas were very broad, so there was a lot of different mechanics involved.

You can see some there :

I had "sort of location" cards in my custom Esgaroth expansions. Those were attachment cards that attached themselves to the current quest stage.

I'm glad someone appreciated my ideas enough to quote them. I totally forgot about these ideas. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
