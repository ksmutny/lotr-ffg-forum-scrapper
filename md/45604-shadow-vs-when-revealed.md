If you deal a card as a shadow card, and it has no "shadow" text, but does have a "when revealed" effect, do you apply that 'when revealed'? or do you just discard it

(i'm hoping the latter, but fearing the former)

You just discard it, during the shadow effect phase of combat only text under the shadow symbol takes effect. If there is no shadow symbol, there is no effect.
