Has anyone heard anything about the GenCon quest for this year? Seems like we knew about lasts years in advance however FFG seems to be keeping it hush hush.

Just seems so odd Gen Con has started and we haven't had a peep from FFG on this. I know they have a few other products to show off as well but this is the Gen Con exclusive!

BGG is doing a live stream of the event, and FFG is showing up to show off some wares.  Perhaps then?
