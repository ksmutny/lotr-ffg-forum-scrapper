The Grey Company tackled The Dunland Trap! Will we escape unscathed? Or will we succumb to the nasty enemies clothed in mithril loincloths? Check out the video to find out!

Pretty awesome video, shame you guys actually lost before retconning the loss! I hate when a defeat comes purely from picking the wrong enemy to block with the wrong character, very harsh....
