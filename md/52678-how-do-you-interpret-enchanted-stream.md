We've played it as meaning no cards drawn during the Resource Phase nor from any card effects like Bilbo or Gandalf while it's the active location.

Is this the intended effect?

no draw = no draw

Why are you trying to find something that is not there?

 It is.  Any effect which uses the word "draw" doesn't happen.  This includes the resource phase, Gandalf, Bilbo, or anything else with the word "draw" in its description.

Absolutely right!  However, a card that allows you to search your deck for a card to 'add' to your hand would be allowable.  Are there any?  Mountains of Mirkwood is an example and could be triggered while Enchanted Stream is active, because of Northern Trackers etc.  Correct?  Cheers!

Gandalf's Search FTW! No, scratch that, it still sucks.

 Yep, Mountains of Mirkwood is fine, Mustering the Rohirrim is fine, the Eagles are Coming! is fine.

Gandalf's Search to the rescue - no, wait, it still sucks... haha, LMAO, that was a good one (*still laughing heartily at nerdy jokes :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]*)

Just for the sake of clarity and for new people to the game asking themselves the same question as gamestar10: Such contradicting effects are handled by current rules.

When Enchanted Stream is the active location, your normal card draw in the resource phase is overridden by the effect of Enchanted Stream. This is handled by the Golden Rule (p. 4 of the rulebook).

When comparing Bilbo + Enchanted Stream or Lorien's Wealth + Enchanted Stream this is not as easy, because there are two contradicting card effects. In this case, the "forbidding" effect has priority. This is stated in FAQ rule 1.14:

(1.14) The word "cannot": If a card effect uses the word "cannot", then it is an absolute: that effect cannot be overridden by other effects.

 

I've been asking myself how to handle direct card effect contradictions, too. But this rule governs it.

Pete, while this is true - I see no contradiction at all! It doesn't state - skip the drawing part of the resource phase - it states PLAYERS CANNOT DRAW CARDS (basta) :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

bilbo enables the first player to draw an ADDITIONAL card in the resource phase - but, I CANNOT DRAW cards... at all... beravor also enables a player to draw 2 cards - but I CANNOT draw cards - also with Gandalf's Search, campfire tales, Gandalf himself, etc.

 

there is no overriding rule - you can subsume beravor and bilbo and everything else under the rule - they cannot draw cards.

don't try to find something, that isn't there :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Well, one step in the resource phase is to draw a card. Enchanted Stream says you cannot draw cards. Bilbo's text reads that the starting player draws 1 (additional) card, Enchanted Stream says that you cannot draw cards. This is a direct contradiction, at least in my view gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]

I just wanted to post it here if someone else also is thinking like me, and save him the time searching the FAQ. And perhaps there will be more complex situations with future cards, where it's not clear what has to be done, if it weren't for rule 1.14... But as we both agree on the same result, there's nothing to worry about happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]
