There are just instructions for the first quest card, no quest value. Should I just follow the directions and immediately flip the card over. Sorry, I know this is basic. It's my first game.

What, the A side of the quest card? Â Yeah, you just follow the instructions on the card, then flip it to the B side (and follow its instructions as well).
