# [Khazad-Dum release date?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57230-khazad-dum-release-date/)

Fire away all speculations!

I found a German store that says: Khazad-Dum 15th December, Redhorn Pass 18th January (but it also says Road to Rivendell 9th December?!? which is complete BS)

Anyway, if 15th December for Khazad-Dum is correct, it will be probably too late for many people who were looking for it as a x-mas present.

 FF International are asking for orders for late Dec early Jan releases - numbers in by 14 DEC.

Not looking good for a pre Christmas release in the UK...

 Thanks for the info. It has been on the boat for a few weeks now, maybe that adds credibility to the 15th. As for me, I choose to believe that if the 15th is the real date for it, there's a good chance that we can have Dwarves for the Holidays. Come on, Christmas magic. Need those Dwarves. 

If I can get Kazad-Dum, I'll celebrate by making an all Dwarf deck on Christmas Eve. It will be painful making a deck without my girlfriend, Eowyn, in it. But I'll be okay.

I was kinda hoping we'd get it released next week, as there have been three previews of it now, which is about average for what the adventure packs got before release. And I was also hoping it would be, like Return to Mirkwood, released in the UK about a week after. So just in time for my birthday!

I hope...

are you bothereing to pre order it here in uk? im toying with the idea

Problem with UK release as far as I understand is that we get sent American product. (Unlike germany & france who have there own printings). So we tend to get things later than America and Europe...

Hear hear Dr. Nate! I want to build that all dwarf deck so badly! Looking forward to it.

I preordered it earlier last month on a whim - maelstrom games had it with a release date of December 17th as I remember, but I'm not really hopeful.

Sadly, I'm adopting the attitude of "it'll come when it comes", though I'm still over-excited!

 More bad news: the Upcoming page was updated today, and Khazad-dum is still "on the boat"

We are running out of days for a pre-Christmas release.

The German publisher has admited that Khazad-Dum wont be available before X-Mas. They announced the release date for the German AND English editions to be January 2012. I guess the whole cycle will be postponed then (Hello Mirkwood cycle!). Seems that FFG doesnt learn from past mistakes, neither concerning production issues nor in communication matters...

mmmm....i know this has probably been said, but wasnt missing christmas deadline a big business mistake, then again khazad is selling out either way for sure

## 17 [zeb on December 12, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57230-khazad-dum-release-date/?do=findComment&comment=566774)

Yes I am not sure this will be a big deal for an expansion. It is more important for them to have the core game available for Christmas actually.

I know I'll be getting it either way... can't wait!

The new preview posted today only builds the anticipation.

Let's all hope this game's lifespan is Silvan. gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]

The Upcoming page says it has shipped from FFG.  Now we just have to wait for about 7 to 10 days for it to get to our Friendly Local Game Store.  So, by Friday, January 6th, hopefully.

That's where I pre-ordered mine from! Sadly, my account page still only says the order is "processing" bostezo.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/bostezo.gif]

yeah mine too, though it does say order now if you look at the product page, i asked them and they said they order from ffg everyweeek, so shouldnt be too long

@ spalanzani

 

i take it you have ordered from maelstrom before??? if so heres a silly question.... do you know if you order two items that are released 1 before the other, (i.e. khazad then the first adventure pack), do you know if they usually split the order and send the one that comes out first? i take it they would, otherwise im defintaly not waiting for rehorn to come out before i get khazad!

I'm afraid but that doesn't mean anything. For example Star Wars LCG is in "order" state too. But you know that it's not released yet.

 

Going from preorder to order seems as automatic process at maelstrom, happens as soon as expected "release date" reached. In case of Khazad-dum it was stated as 12/27 so it was changed that time automatically.

 

Of course, unlike as with Star Wars LCG, with Khazad-dum it is quite close to real.

I've received whole Mirkwood cycle and base game from maelstrom. They splitted my first order, but it seems that they will NOT split orders any more. I would recommend to split orders yourself, it's easy since shipping cost is zero anyway.

## 33 [richsabre on December 29, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57230-khazad-dum-release-date/?do=findComment&comment=572250)

mmmm...those are ill tidings indeed, ive contacted them, i find that a very strange thing for them to do so

 

EDIT: i was so horrifyed by what you said sorpresa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sorpresa.gif] that i rang them, it appears if you ring up when khazad is in stock they wil split it...phew....

Actually, Khazad-dum was my first order with them! I have since made a few other orders though, and currently have an order in for A King in the North (not yet in stock) and Signs of Faith (in stock), but this is being held, presumably until the reprinted chapter pack comes into stock. It's a good thing that I'm in no particular rush for the Warhammer pack! At least you've managed to get a definite answer on khazad from them, anyway!
