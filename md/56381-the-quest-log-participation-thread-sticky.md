# [The Quest Log - Participation Thread - Sticky? ](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56381-the-quest-log-participation-thread-sticky/)

G'day chaps. Trying to keep this as short as possible.

The Quest Log is a really good thing. It's exactly what a game like LotR LCG needs. It can potentially extend the gaming experience from pure intrinsic fun to a challenging competition, adding a factor of consistency and longlivity which makes other games of same and different kind alike successfull. However, in its current form it can't really live up to its potential.

When I log into my Quest Log (no pun intended) I can see the results of all my games and a ton of statistics, which is awesome. However, I cannot see how others are performing, what a top score on a specific quest is, what kind of weird hero combinations people are using etc. In order to do that I would have to make "friends" with people on the forum which is a huge limitation. Usually the vast majority of forum users are lurkers. They read the forums as often and play as often, they simply refuse to make an account and / or contribute to threads, since its (usually) a big waste of time. This is my pledge to a more open and accessible kind of quest log. I would greatly appreciate a comment from FFQ on the regard.

Now onto the actual subject:

To make the Quest Log in its current form worthwhile and work in the way that it's supposed to you'd need a friends list full of Quest Log users. This thread is supposed to accomplish this in the best way as it's currently possible.

I'm making a start here:

Everyone who wants to participate in the Quest Log, feel free to add me as friend. (In the request, leave a comment that says "quest log")

Everyone who wants to enrichen the Quest Log experience just like that is welcome to leave a similar message on this thread. 

 

Note of FFG: If a sufficent number of players actually use this kind of "service" it would be a good idea to sticky it so that every new player who comes across this board can access the player list right away. Feel free to edit as pleased and / or even merge it with the current quest log thread, adjusting the title or so.

 

Regards,

 

Chris

Can I compare quests verse all friends at once, or only 1 friend at a time?

 I have a lot more plays with the old scoring system than with the current one (darn retail hours in November!). However, I will continue to put in when I can. Quest Log me!

Me too, I dont post much and am often distracted by AGoT, but I'd love to see what others are doing!

btw, when scoring a multi-player game, are you supposed to list the "final group score" for your score, or just add your heroes damage and your threat level to the rounds and subtract victory points

It's the final group score (add everything together minus vp).

 

This thread is a deja vu - but a good one. Feel free to add me
