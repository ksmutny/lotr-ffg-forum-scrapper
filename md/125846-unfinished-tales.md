I wanted to get my own copy of Unfinished Tales (instead of trying to get a hold on the English version of my local library, which seems to be taken always!), but I was wondering which edition is the 'best' one, most up-to-date, most edited to be correct, most.. well you see where this is going. It has to be an English version. 

Thanks for any advice and help!

I didn't know there were multiple versions...  But I will say that if you enjoyed the Silmarillion, Unfinished Tales is a must-read in my opinion.  Silmarillion is easily my favorite fiction book and it was a real treat to get some of the stories contained in UT.  Just grab whichever edition you can get your hands on and enjoy it!   :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Yeah it seems like there are about 10 reprints or so..

Yes, I liked the Silmarillion, and the Appendices and I think I'm gonna love UT. (i do, but English version is probably even more worth it) Thanks anyway!

It has some really interesting stuff in it for sure.  I learned a lot of back-story/behind the scenes stuff that happened while the War of the Ring was happening which was very interesting.

I just finished reading it for the first time a few weeks ago.

 

Funny thing is, playing this game as much as I have been over the past few months has inspired me to (re)read all of my Tolkien stuff from beginning to end. I really enjoyed Unfinished Tales (incl. the endnotes to each story/essay), and was pleasantly surprised to find that roughly 90% of what I thought Peter Jackson had "added" to the first Hobbit movie and that was not in The Hobbit (book), actually had a basis in Unfinished Tales!

 

Just started re-reading The Silmarillion this week. Will then go on to re-read The Children of Hurin (really liked that one the first time I read it), The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. Not sure when in the sequence I should read the LotR related material found in Tales from the Perilous Realm, which I do not yet own (but half expect someone will get me for Xmas). Also not sure if there is anything in the History of Middle Earth series that is considered a must-read? Vol. 3, The Lays of Beleriand, maybe?

 

Any thoughts?

 

I have also ordered an Atlas of Middle-Earth to help me visualize the places and movements associated with various characters as well as the changing landscape of the Middle Earth, which should be arriving soon… heh...

Hey, that's cool, me too!

I started first with the LoTR themselves, but then in English, for I find that the language the books are supposed to be read in. (plus I can't stand the stupid name translations in Dutch, like Balins instead of Baggins..)

 

 

I also liked the Children of Hurin too! And also going to buy an Atlas, although Master of Lore's Atlas is also pretty neat. http://masteroflore.wordpress.com/2014/07/26/introducing-master-of-lores-lotr-lcg-atlas/ [http://masteroflore.wordpress.com/2014/07/26/introducing-master-of-lores-lotr-lcg-atlas/]

 

Hmmm, as far as I noted, the History of ME is mostly about how Tolkien put it together, not really much of stories there I thought. But maybe you like that?

I'm not sure if there is a language difference, or maybe I just can't find it, but ...

 

There is a difference in a "printing" and an "edition".  A book can undergo many print runs, or "printings" and still be the first edition.  (The first edit.)  As far as I can tell from looking at the major on-line book stores, there is still only one edition of this book.  And, in any event, I am willing to bet with Christopher Tolkien, if there are any changes, they are very minor.

 

My dad has an old copy of Unfinished Tales which is probably pretty close to the first printing which I have read, and I bought it on Nook early this year.  I haven't looked for any differences, but  haven't noticed any either.

Thanks for the info, I was aware of the difference, but I thought I found two different editions. As for language differences, I talk about translations, and the Dutch version of our library uses odd words and names sadly..

But thanks for the help!

on the note of the history series reading the ones that concentrate on the LOTR novel itself is well worth it... especially the shadow of the past and treason of isengard... i wont spoil it for anyone (sounds strange saying it about something written so long ago) but there are some crazy changes that would have been in the story, some are outragous, some you wish Tolkien had written through and kept in
