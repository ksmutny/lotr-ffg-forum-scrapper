# [Core Game: Healing?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59142-core-game-healing/)

Just picked up the core game this weekend and we are working thru our first (practice) game.  We grabbed the Tactics and Leadership decks without really thinking much about it for our trial run, but soon realized there isn't anyway to heal wounds!  In the base game, is there a way to heal wounds without the Lore deck?  Do any of the adventure packs add healing to the spheres of influence?

 Healing so far is all in the lore sphere.

So in a two player game, without building a custom deck, you almost have to use the Lore deck to have much hope of success, correct?

 Not neccessarily, but you will be need to be every thoughtful about getting allies into play and who defends and attacks.

Not at all. Each of the spheres has its own strengths and weaknesses. With a little practice, you'll be able to tailor your strategy to the advantages and disadvantages of your decks. Take the scenario you presented: Tactics and Leadership. Between the two of you, you can generate lots of resources, boost your characters' stats, and destroy enemies very effectively. You will have trouble healing wounds, drawing cards, canceling effects, and managing threat (as those are the strengths of Lore and Spirit, respectively). So, you should be able to play plenty of allies, but you'll have to be judicious about choosing defenders and assigning damage.

Also, while there's no healing outside of Lore, Tactics does have the powerful Citadel Plate, which gives a hero +4 health. Doesn't remove damage, but performs essentially the same function (i.e. preventing damage from killing a character).
