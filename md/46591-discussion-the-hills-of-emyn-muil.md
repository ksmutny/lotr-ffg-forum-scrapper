Nobody seems to have opened a thread yet to discuss this announcement.

I got fairly excited when I read the article today. I like the creativity behind the quest design that already shows through. So we get our first "One-Card quest"! I imagine this to be quite funny, since the locations will probably provide some fairly brutal conditions and we still have to face enemies that prevent us from putting those progress counters on the locations!

I can imagine that Spirit's allies (Northern Tracker and Lorien Guide) might prove very useful. And Legolas will probably take a break on this one!

Now that I have the core set, I thought waiting on the Adventure Packs would be easy...turns it out it just made want those pack really desperately.

I gotta be honest here:

 

As cool as this Adventure Pack looks, and as glad as I am to be getting new information about this game, I would really have liked to hear a release date for Hunt for Gollum instead...

Yes i feel the same but not so much for the extra cards or the new scenarios but more for the new characters.There are so many characters i want to see in this game which makes any  adventure pack a must have for me.

ps: I WANT GALADRIEL AND I WANT HER NOW babeo.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/babeo.gif]

I just hope ffg will assign the art of Galadriel to the same guy who made The favor of Galadriel card.Perfect is the only ward i can say for this avatar and i can't think a better Galadreil than this one.

I salute you Magali Villeneuve.

Well, yes, it actually is disappointing that we didn't get any news on the Hunt for Gollum adventure pack. I was quite surprised, too, that ffg prefers to talk about an adventure pack so far in the future when fans obviously want to hear about the one up next.

But still I couldn't help but get excited.

So many characters I am looking forward to: Galadriel, Arwen, Elrond, Pippin, Merry....I actually hope there will be the possibility to build "race" decks...like a deck full of Hobbit Heroes and Hobbit allies...well we saw that one already in Decipher's tcg, but it would still be nice!

Well we're going to be getting Bilbo and Frodo in the first two packs, I believe.

I'm really excited about this adventure pack. I love location cards and I'm interested to see what creative stuff they'll do with them.

I[m interested in a single card quest deck - I wonder how many VP will be required to actually beat the quest. I would expect this to be location heavy with interesting card text like Rauros Falls which could be pretty nasty if you are being swamped by enemies, but there are certainly ways to ready your heroes after the fact, and I believe that there will be other cards in the upcoming Adventure packs that will do the same thing.

I know it's just after my breakfast time, but still retasted it after reading about a Hobbit deck demonio.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/demonio.gif] .

We will see stuff on the Hunt for Gollum on Thursday probably which seems to be the day they are doing the Lord of the Rings card previews and stuff. All the LCG's have the same day every week they get card previews etc. This article was just a product announcement which are always done 3 months in advance of the release of the product. We know Hunt for Gollum is this month already.

Looking forward to all the Adventure Packs, but yes - me wants a release date for Gollum, yes my precious.

You could shuffle the Rauros Falls card into the Journey Down The Anduin scenario.  If you draw it, it means you forgot to get off the raft... :-)

FFG rarely ever gives the exact date of a release. Best place to check is tabletop gaming news website. We know Hunt for Gollum is this month, most likely around the 27th.

I would love for this news to be true, but, with Hunt for Gollum still at the printer's, I have trouble seeing how anyone gets their hands on it before June.

I agree. Even if the status got changed to being shipped, it still has potentially 4-6 weeks. I don't see that happening unfortunately.

 I do believe Rauros Falls proves that the design team is full of malicious sadists who don't have feelings the same way you and I do.

Not particularly excited. It's at least 3 months down the line and we really didn't get a lot of details on it. New hero, attachment and ally cards, I could have told you that myself.
