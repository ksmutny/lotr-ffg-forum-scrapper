# [Encounter cards in different colour sleeves, question.](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/251932-encounter-cards-in-different-colour-sleeves-question/)

Sleeving my encounter cards, got them in a storage box and started to have each cycle in a different colour (player cards in clear) to make it easier to organize. Then I got the lost realm deluxe, and there were some player cards that get mixed in with the encounter cards (ranger summon). This sent alarm bells ringing as if there was a lot of these types of cards or there was a deluxe that used encounter cards from day the core set I would have to resleeve, something I don't want to do.

Any reason apart from this card not to do this?

Thanks for any help

Not a lot of those, though there are a couple more Encounter cards that can be shuffled into your player deck.

Yeah there are not many.  I think that ranger you're referring to is the only one, and maybe one more has been spoiled but not released yet. (?)

You'll just have to keep a few spare sleeves handy so you can put them into the right color sleeve for the quest that you're playing.

As they says there is only a few. In fact I got more problem with loot cards (in hobbit saga for example) that begin in my deck. As far I remember all the encounter effects make you shuffle cards after the set up so you can even use sleeves from your beginning hand.

I do as you do and I also sleeve set-up encounter cards that was never shuffled back in different sleeves so I never have to look at them. Very useful

Excellent, thanks very much. Seems like such a small thing, but I've got one of them storage cases (kakapopo) and its full to the brim, thousands of cards. Being able to tell what deluxe in pulling out is kind of handy. 

Hoping watcher in the water finely gets reprinted soon so I can complete that cycle ?

I was just planning on doing the same thing (colour coding the cycles).  Out of interest, which colours did you pick for each?

I use dragonshields. My favourite for fit and choice of colours

Matte black ones for mirkwood and core quests

Brown for khazad

Sky blue for heirs

Purple for voice of isengard

Player cards are in clear, but heroes are in gold.

Saga packs I might go for a dark green.

nice.  I also prefer the dragon shield, though only the matte ones... I find the classic not up to par.

i have the core/mirkwood as green, khazad dum as gold, heirs as silver

and then wanted the saga series to be yellow/orange/red, the colour getting hotter the closer they get to mount doom.

...oh the shame!
