Yay!

Just a week or so for the USA.

A small month for us in Europe!

Guess the boat didn't sink after all...

Woohoo!

FFG, prepare to take my money!

 

Hopefully we'll see the preview article by the end of the week. I think the really big LotR previews usually go out Friday afternoon so I'd expect to see one very soon. My biggest hope is that Theoden gets his equivalent of Vilya so he becomes the powerhouse he should be. If it exists, that's the card I'd like to see spoiled in the preview!

 

Because this box set is so late, I wonder if they'll delay the release of the new AP's or should we expect them on the original schedule?

The APs weren't going to be until 2Q anyway, so I hope they aren't pushed back anymore.

Yeees! Finally! I live in Europe so I hope I will play it this month.

If I have it by the weekend after this one, I will be outrageously  happy.  Can't wait to travel to Isengard!

Yea well, we've yet to see a single pack released on it's scheduled date.

FFG's planning on announcing and releasing is just plain crap at best.

I'm not expecting to see the first pack of the cycle anywhere before August.

If I remember correctly, the Steward's Fear came out in late May, early June with Druadan Forest fairly quickly afterwards. I'm guessing we'll see the same thing this time around.

I do hope you guess right.

I too want them cards sooner rather then later.

Though the whole against the shadow cycle also was delayed 3 months or so, I remember.

So I am betting on a delay here too.

Then when it is delayed, and it will be, the impact won't be as heart breaking & soul shattering.

Yes, that news made my day. Money in hand and ready to go.
