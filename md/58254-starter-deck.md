hi, for your first game a single sphere with all the copies of the cards in that sphere and 1 copy of gandalf is the recommended way to go, use 3 heros that belong to that sphere (so eowyn for spirit, beravor for lore etc)

 when you start to advance multi sphere decks can be constructed, that have to have

 

3 heros of your choice

minimum 50 cards

no more than 3 copies of each card
