# [Official Alt Art Cards?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/258858-official-alt-art-cards/)

Hi there!

I live far from the US–and therefore, Gen Con–and I just went last year to my first Fellowship event. As such, I'd like to know what is the official list of alternate art cards published by FFG and, ideally, links to images I can proxy. 

Thanks a lot in advance!

We need a Lore hero. Three Leadership, three Tactics, soon to be one Spirit.

I would really like to see a Dain version with an art similar to the movies!

Have there been anymore alt art cards to add to this list? For example I recently got my hand on the Woodland Realm and an Alt Card Spirit Eowyn.

On another note any of you people have some alt art cards you are wishing to sell? Cause I would really love to add some of them to my collection.

This year we got the Alt Art Eowyn that you found as a part of the Fellowship kit. We also got an Alt Art version of Lore (Core) Glorfindel as a part of the Gen Con 2018 kit alongside The Wizard's Quest. It is unlikely to come across that one, as Gen Con alt arts are much rarer than Fellowship ones (also counts for Gimli, Boromir, and Celeborn).

In terms of getting a hold of these Alt Art cards, the official ones are rare but can occasionally be found on Ebay for ridiculous prices. Sometimes, the community finds an extra kit and tries to sell the pieces via the Facebook group or the forums, so keep an eye on that. I myself got my hands on 2 Fellowship 2015 kits with Legolas and sold them to the community as well. Attending events like Gen Con and your local Fellowship event is still the most reliable (and cheapest) way to get a hold of these cards. Otherwise, Strange Eons will let you make your own Alt Art cards, but they won't be official.

With me living in Italy getting to a Fellowship event is quite the tall order unfortunately.

I think you can still order the kit. Then sell the other 3 copies in the pack?  If that's an option for you

The shops can not officially sell those kits to individual peoples... some shop keepers does not keep this stright but if They follow Ffg rules, They can not sell them to you...

I don't think I can order those as a single person, aren't those only for shops and events?

That is true, but most FLGSs here in the Netherlands would order it for you during the event if you ask them. You'll have to use the shop as a middle man, but that is still a good method of obtaining the kits. You can also try to find other players in Italy who would like to attend the event, giving them a part of the kit as well. That's how I got my hands on the 2017 kit last year. This year was a bit weird with the Fellowship event though, so I head to go to FFG headquarters in Minneapolis to get my copy during Con of the Rings.

Can these alt art cards be found in the "Print on Demand"-packs? Or somewhere else?

You find them in the Fellowship Kits (which usually contain the POD quest, a playmat and the alt card) like this [https://www.ebay.it/itm/Lord-of-the-Rings-LCG-2018-Fellowship-Event-Kit-Playmat-Woodland-Realm-LotR/283628720795?hash=item420996d29b:g:~acAAOSwYCRb08kl] for example, not in the normal Print on Demand Packs you buy in this website or on other retailers, like this one [https://www.ebay.it/itm/Lord-of-the-Rings-LCG-The-Woodland-Realm-standalone-scenario/254215760683?hash=item3b3070ab2b:g:iBEAAOSwZF5cx~2O]. The Kits are usually given to those which participate at events like GenCon or the Fellowship Events.
