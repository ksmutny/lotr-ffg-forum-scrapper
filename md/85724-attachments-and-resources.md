Can I just check….

I know that to play an attachment card you must match the resource from a character with the same sphere of influence as the card you wish to play, but….

Can you then play that attachment to any hero, regardless of the sphere of influence?

yes you can. an attatchment will say what restrictions it has.

it will say things such as

'attatch to a (lore/spirit etc.) hero'

'attatch to a 'gondor/rohan/eagle etc. character'

if it doesnt saying anything like that then you can attatch to any character

Yes, the attachment can be placed on a hero of any sphere.  

Once you get beyond the core set you will run into some of these other situations with attachments.  There are some attachment cards that are restricted to a sphere, but can be attached to the hero once the hero gains the resource Icon (songs etc.)   and some attachemnts can only be played on a hero with the printed sphere/resource icon, which means it is restricted to that sphere now way to get around it with songs etc.   Some attachments can be placed on characters as well, not just heroes.
