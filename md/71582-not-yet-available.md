I am relatively new to LCG, having picked up Warhammer Invasion a few months back. I am thinking of getting the LOTR LCG, either soon or for x-mas, as I do a lot of solo play (Which now consists of deckbuilding and play-testing with W:I).

I was looking through the products page for LOTR LCG and noticed when I clicked on the link to the core set, it said "Not yet available" instead of "Buy now".

It also showed different artwork than what is/was on the box of the core set.

Is there a new addition coming out? Does anyone know? Would I be better off to wait until this "new" core set comes out, if that even is what this is?

Perhaps this is just an error on the webpage?!?

i would say find a core set from another stockist (perhaps  ffg is out of stock?) as i heard something about re prints but it wont be anything groundbreaking- just errated card being corrected….so you wont be missin much, unless of course things like this bothers you, but i havent heard anything from ffg's end about it, so im not sure how far down the line these reprints are

as for the different photo - its always been like that as far as i can recall, so probably doesnt signify much

 Agree with rich, it is just out of stock.  If you look at the product details page here [http://store.fantasyflightgames.com/productdetails.cfm?SKU=MEC01], it says the availability is "out of stock."
