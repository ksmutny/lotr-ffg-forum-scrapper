That site appears to be broken for me (IE9). As soon as I click on a link my basket is empty and I'm logged out.

Curious as to where that info came from.  As friends with people who run other shops in the UK (online and FLGS) and know people who work at the distributors, nobody there has heard anything about a date yet.   Of course, 28th May could be right, but I've been unable to confirm it at my sources.

If it is right, I need new sources :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Amazon UK have it on their site, but no full date, just June 2011.

I mean a link at their site, as in "check out" etc.
