I have just ordered 2 extra copies of CORE. I am seriously loving this game and was umming and arrrring about getting more copies of core for a while but then thought.. hey.. I'm still spending nearly 1/3rd of what I did on MTG, so in a degenerate gambler type thinking I am still "up" from were I was when i quit MTG.... in MTG you wouldn't blink twice at spending 40bucks on a single card.

Anyway.. I will be selling all my duplicates above 3.. so will have a lot of cards to sell including some really good ones. I'll also be selling 2x Threat Counters.

When the cards arrive I will post them so you can see what is in stock, and if you reply to this post I'll PM you.. if there is a lot of interest I will use ebay auction to sell them and PM everyone who replies so they will not miss it.

I would be willing to pay a couple dollars for extras of the encounter sets. I'm not sure what you were looking for price wise.

I'm interested in 1 or 2 Threat counters, and possibly some player cards.
