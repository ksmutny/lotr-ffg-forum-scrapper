If you use Flight of the Eagles and select Eagle of the north to return to your hand. Are you able to put that Eagle back into play via any effects or paying for it? Since it doesn't have a sphere or cost.

No. Eagle of the North would be in a weird state where it just sits in your hand indefinitely. You could still discard it from your hand if an encounter card says to or you want to trigger, say, Spirit Eowyn.

According to the rules of Roam accross Rhovanion (or any other pack with player encounter cards): If a player card with the encounter keyword leaves play, it is removed from the game.

Thus you cannot take an Eagle of the Misty Mountains into your hand.

Yep, any player card with the encounter keyword is removed from the game when it leaves play (so, also that ranger guy).
