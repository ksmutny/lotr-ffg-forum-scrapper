I'm fairly new to the game so I'm not exactly sure how FF usuals deals with this, but older adverture packs like Hunt for Gollum, etc are basically impossible to find. Will these ever be re-printed or is somone like me out of luck?

 

thanks

Look at the "upcoming" section of this website (at the top, 3rd from the left).  It also lists reprints along with new games coming out over the next year or so.  At least 3 of the Shadows of Mirkwood cycle APs are listed there.

Wow.  I was about to chide you for not grabbing it from Amazon, but after I just searched, Hunt for Gollum is indeed nowhere to be found.  That is nuts!

http://www.fairyglen.com/lotrlcg.html [http://www.fairyglen.com/lotrlcg.html] still has The hunt for glum in stock. Took me an hour of searching to find this site.
