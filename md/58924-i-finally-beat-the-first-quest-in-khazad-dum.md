Well I am happy. I had a really good game with just enough challenge to not make me loose my temper.  At first I didn't think I was going to pull it out but I ended up having a total threat of 44 at the end; I am happy.  I built a Spirit/Tactics deck with absolutely no song cards.  Starting heroes: Gimli, Frodo, Dwalin.  The deck is just a mixture of tactic and spirit cards that I think are really cool and good.  Oh yeah, I had 2 Northern Trackers out by turn 4, so that may have helped me a bit. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
