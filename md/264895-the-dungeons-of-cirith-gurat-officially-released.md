Attach Diligent Noble to Brand or Dain.

They now have the Noble trait.

Dan,  is that an alternate art Emery close to the middle of the picture at about 7:30?  With the pixie haircut?

UPS is really behind apparently.  (News says 2 days.)  I usually have my packs ON release day and not so yet.  Hope I have it by tomorrow as I'm counting on a couple of those cards.
