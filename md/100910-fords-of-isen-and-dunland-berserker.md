The location Fords of Isen has the Forced effect: After Fords of Isen becomes the active location, each player with fewer than 5 cards in his hand draws cards until he has 5 in his hand.

 

Dunland Berserker has the Forced effect: After the engaged player draws any number of cards, Dunland Berserker makes an attack

 

The question is: if you have to draw more than one card for Fords of Isen, is this:

1. considered to be a one-time drawing of cards (triggering one attack from the Berserker), or

2. do you draw the cards one at a time (triggering several attacks)?

 

I followed the "make things harder" principle and played with option (2).

I think the "make things harder" principle just makes the game more subjective.  I like a consistency approach.  There's no reason to use the wording "any number of cards" on the Berserker except to ensure that he isn't making an unreasonable number of attacks.  I think it's written that way so that effects which allow you to draw multiple cards, like Wealth of Lorien, Fords of Isen, Bilbo, Ori, etc, count as only one trigger for the Berserker.  I guess Fords of Isen is a little unusual in its wording ("draw until he has 5") but I don't see anything to suggest that this should be parsed as a series of individual effects resolved one at a time.

I totally agree with GrandSpleen here.

 

 

Not that in my games any Berserker lived that long to use his ability. :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

I think you are probably right - it's just the wording "draw until" that left me uncertain, because that seemed to me to imply a sequence of separate drawings.

 

However, I don't think you are quite right that "make things harder" makes the game more subjective. I agree that it is desirable to play by clear and consistent rules; however, it is usually much clearer (therefore less a matter of opinion, therefore less subjective) what will be harder for the players, than what is the correct ruling in a given situation!

Choosing a subjective criteria to make decisions is still subjective. No one would call North Korean elections more objective just because they have that "vote that guy or get shot" principle. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

I usually go with more difficult interpretations, but i am notorious in this game for unintentionally making the game more difficult than it is. Although if i am aware of the choice, I select the difficult path, since if i play it that way and win then I have no problem adjusting to a ruling that makes it easier. If it's the other way around, i may have a harder time adjusting to the increased difficulty.

Just my personal preference in how i handle these situations in the game.

A clarifying question...each time berserker attacks he is dealt a shadow card correct? And the player is able to exhaust a character to defend this attack?

Side note but the I assume the ill tidings card counts towards the 5 total in your hand and the "surge" is completed during the reveal 1 card per player from encounter deck under quest phase? Trying to get the swing of these new mechanics! Thanks guys.

Yes, the berserker gets a shadow card each time he attacks.

 

Yes, the player may declare a character as a defender each time.

 

And yes, Ill Tidings counts towards the 5 card limit.

 

Looks like you did get the swing already... ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]
