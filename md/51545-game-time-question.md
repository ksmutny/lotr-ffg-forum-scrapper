hi guys, i have now played my second game of lord of the rings, where we tried the 2nd quest in the core set.  On average how long do your games take? I realize that we are still learning cards, so that's a factor, but we played for 2 hrs last night and didn't finish. Just more of a curiosity than anything else.  Although at this point i don't see how tournaments will ever work for this game with the lengths we are running.

 We play 4-player games in between 60-90 minutes, and I can do a solo game in about 30-40.  Our first few games were REALLY slow, though, because we weren't quite used to the rules.  It'll go faster when you don't have to look everything up :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
