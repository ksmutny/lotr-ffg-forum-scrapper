The Saruman card says: "Doomed 3. At the end of the round, discard Saruman from play.
Response: After Saruman enters play, choose a non-unique enemy or location in the staging area. While Saruman is in play, the chosen enemy or location is considered to be out of play.Â "

In this case if a location is considered to be out of play, could I travel to that location even though it's out of play?

Regards,

No you can't affect him in any way. You can't travel or put tokens on it.
