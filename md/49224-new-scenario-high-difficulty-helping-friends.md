# [new scenario, high difficulty - Helping Friends](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49224-new-scenario-high-difficulty-helping-friends/)

i had the following intentions:
- a challenge for custom decks
- different gameflow: not so easy to just power up at start and then rush through stages 2 and 3.
- better scaling for player number. we tested only with 2 players, but it should scale well for 1-3. with 4 players there might be a problem with too many forests in stage 1.

 

if someone wants an easier version use the following changes:
- only 2 threat per round in stage 1
- in stage 1 only put aside vp cards that would otherwise be placed in the staging area

errata covering the the new FAQ: 3A should read "reveal cards from the encounter deck" instead of "draw cards from the encounter deck". this is to clarify that card effects trigger.
clarification: but you keep drawing until you have the needed number of cards in the staging area (note that treachery cards are discarded after their effect and not placed in the staging area)

Try already solo. Win 2 times. Last time have 18 victory points.

i'm pretty sure this is harder in multiplayer than solo (if you build decks)

What is a "forest"? Is it a card with the word "Forest" in the title or a tree as the icon?

Forest is a keyword on a location.

IMO, the most powerful 2 player decks for this scenario:

1. Beravor(4-5 UC), Gloin(plate, peak with DK for optimal damage/heal, Common Cause Beravor), Eowyn(Steward, Protector of Lorien)

2. Gimli(Plate(s), some UC, Tooks brings him high threat meat to head off, DK), Theodred(Protector of Lorien), Dunhere(Dark Knowledge, Horn, Common Cause Gimli)

Also, both decks should have 3 Stewards - this card is just so good and 2nd stage make players discard anyway.

Anyway, for 2 players I'd do 2 crucial changes: ban/restrict/limit Unexpected Courage, ban Gimli or cap his damage.

1. Beravor + mass UC, Protector mass discard = 1-2 turn and it's the end of the stage. Later mass discard is not even really needed because of Faramir + Ever Vigilant combo. Way too easy.

2. Gimli + 1-2 UC (+Common Cause) + plate + mass Tooks bringing all enemies to him = he heads off everything with 1 hit. Even trolls are a joke so something is not right.

Other than that scenario is really good.

Doh. I should have realized it was the keyword, but I think it's the first time I've seen it referenced by anything.

yeah well, many changes should be done to balance this game in my oppinion. too many, to put them all in a scenario and still play the same game in my oppinion. one of my big issues is that gandalf is labeled "ally" while the effect of the card feels more like an "event". that would also fix all his troubles and exploits. next issue is the power of some cards like unexpected courage (allowed 3 times - lol) and steward of gondor, or the obligatory eowyn in every game.

 

anyways, we are currently testing a new version that allows you to draw cards in stage 2 only if you discard the same amount of cards beforehand (instead of discarding 1 card each round). that fixes the "camping in stage 2" and likely also prevents gimli from becoming that powerful before you reach stage 3, unless you are lucky. unfortunately, the only way to prevent a scenario from being boring seems to be enourmous time pressure or to disable core functions of the game (card drawing in this case).

we are also testing another selfmade scenario =) got crushed in stage 2 on first try. looks promising :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Your scenario is really great!

We beat it after 3 tries,  but so far it has been harder than Dol Gundor most times.

Great challenge with one core, and we only used 1 Gandalf each.

We beat it the first time with the following combo:

Breavor/Gimli, Legolas

Aragorn, Gloin/Dunhere

 

We were really lucky with our draw (both stewards in the first rounds, Favor of the lady at the beginning and so on...). So, its quite possible that we lose next time as well. Will try it with 3 players in then next few days!

You can't have 2 Steward of Gondor in play at the same time. The card is unique.

updated version available on BGG (see link in the OP).

higher res (300 dpi), better formatting, some tweaks to the mechanics and better scaling.
