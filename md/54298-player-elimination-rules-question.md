# [Player Elimination Rules Question](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54298-player-elimination-rules-question/)

So, we were playing a 4-player game today.  One of the players was quickly eliminated.  For the rest of the game, do we still flip 4 cards from the Encounter Deck during the Quest phase?  Also, we were using the location with X threat where X = the number of players in the game.  Does this remain 4, even though only 3 players are still playing?

 

Thanks!

From the rules:

"Note that after a player is eliminated, one less card is revealed from the encounter deck during the staging step of the quest phase, as there is now one less player involved in the game."

So, you would then only draw 3 cards from encounter deck, and the location would be 3 threat strength.

Thanks!  I thought that I had read something about that, but I didn't see it when I flipped back through the rules, nor did I see it in the FAQ's.

 

Thanks again!
