Condition - after time counter is removed from the current quest, attached hero takes 1 damage.

Is this condition only for the current quest and it will not be relevant for any subsequent quest stages with time counters?

It attachs itself to an hero, and does not specify the current quest. So it should trigger for every quest (that has time counter). It's as the card say.
