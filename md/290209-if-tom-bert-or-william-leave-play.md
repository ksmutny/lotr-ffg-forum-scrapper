Greetings!

Asking at the source since I have seen completely contradictory answers to this question.  In "Over the Hill and Under the Hill" the troll cards each have a different effect on them that applies to all 3, like "can only be attacked by one character".  We were assuming that those effects continue to apply, even if the troll with that effect on it leaves play (killed).  However, there are numerous posts that suggest that the players focus on taking Tom out first, then multiple characters can attack the other trolls or taking out the troll with the text that you cannot place attachments on the trolls, so that the Forrest Snare could work on the other trolls.

Can anyone help with a definitive answer to this?

Many, many thanks!

If a card is not in play, its text is inactive. So, if you defeat Tom, he leaves play and his text is now inactive, and you may attack other trolls with multiple characters.
