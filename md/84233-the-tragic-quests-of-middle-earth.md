## 1 [TragicTheBlathering on May 23, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/84233-the-tragic-quests-of-middle-earth/?do=findComment&comment=798151)

Here be the chronicle of my travels through Middle Earth with Lord of the Rings The Card Game. These will most likely all be solo games and I will be starting at the beginning of the quest lines and working my way forward.

I'm going to be using a semi limited card pool. A Cycle pool so to speak. Meaning, that each delux expantion has its own associated 6 pack cycle.. and that is a pool. So the Mirkwood Pool is CORE + The Mirkwood cycle. The Darowdelf Pool is CORE + The Mirkwood cycle + Kaz + the Darrowdelf cycle. Etc etc.

I'm going to try and show a different deck every time, and will attempt to not favor any sphere or hero.. Though that may be hard at the start as Lore / Spirit was really so strong!

Hope you enjoy it ...

Have Fun and ROLL HIGH!

Really cool stuff there, Tragic! I really like what you said during the Journey Along the Anduin playthrough regarding the high difficulty of the game. I'm glad you've returned!

Keep up the good work!

Nice to have another "Let's Play" focused on this game. It has been a pleasure to watch your videos. I hope you'll continue beating Mirkwood cycle and others!

i'll get to it eventually. Still it will be a while as I am going though the quest in order. I skipped Escape, but will go beat uit once I enter the Darowdelf Cycle and then I'll do Nightmare mode after I get into the current cycle… Though I guess I could do it as soon as I enter the Hobbit cycle.

Mirkwood Cycle 4 - The Hills of Emyn Muil

The Tragic Quests of Middle Earth Playlist [http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyyQgJXgN4c6oNrOpg5NKHz9NZspcX-CZ]

 

Quest [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXdP1r_26kk&list=PLyyQgJXgN4c6oNrOpg5NKHz9NZspcX-CZ&index=3] / A Pleasant Walk [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/index.php?/topic/12720-lotr-deck-a-pleasant-walk/]

The Hills of Emyn Muil is probably one of the worst solo quest yet printed. You can basically play it blindfolded. Yet here is a deck to beat it! WOOT.

While The Hills of Emyn Muil can be a bit of a problem with 4 players (starting threat 12 + 4 reveals ramps it a bit) compared to modern quests even then it is not that hard.

There is only 1 monsters that is under 30 threat in this deck, so the goal is to just quest though the locations and never have to deal with the mobs at all.

Always quest with Frodo in case a Dol Guldur Orcs is revealed, so you can eat the dmg in threat. Keep Eleanor up for treachery cancelling and speeding up the location draw form the deck.

Have Fun and ROLL HIGH

Right, so the next video in my progression series! Woot, and we are finally in the Darowdelf Cycle, so the card pool has really opened up and a bunch of really cool option is now open to us.

 

This is the first of the Kaz quests, Into the Pit and as always I am using a restricted card pool. So only cards from Core, Mirkwood, Khaz and Darowdelf are being used.

Flight from Moria (Kaz 3/3) (Dwarrowdelf Pool)

Quest: Flight from Moria : Attempt 3 [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJWJSMQPf_g&list=PLyyQgJXgN4c6oNrOpg5NKHz9NZspcX-CZ&index=1]

The first time I tried to record this quest beat the game in like turn 3. Was really crazy, and not very fun to watch. If people really want I can upload it but hardly anything happened.

So I did a 2nd version with the hope of getting more stuff on tape. Then I thought I would do a 3rd take and see if I could get a even more interesting showing.

This quest is so random with how it tries to convey the feeling of getting lost in the mines. I wanted the recording to show some of that really cool "getting lost" stuff.

So I thought I would run a 3rd attempt but this time LackeyCCG as it is so easy to film.. just hit record and play and try to get a even more interesting game.

Thanks. I've got a way to go though. I have just started Darrowdelf, so Road to Rivendale is next. That is 6 vids then Hobbit 1+2. That is another 6. The The Shadow Cycle... Also Nigtmares start during Shadow I think as well.

A lot on your plate, indeed! Plus your other videos are pure enjoyment, too. I am really happy you showed us Android the Boardgame, I was quite curious about that one for a while already.

 

Of course no pressure timewise, I also look forward to your Dwarrowdelf playthrough :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I really enjoy doing it. So it is not really like work. Android is only 1/2 though.. I will be restarting that soon. I get really busy of Xmas is all. I have a number of plays like this. Galaxy Defender, Arkham Horror, Pathfinder to name a few... are also ongoing progression series. I'm not in any rush :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Redhorn Gate is actually next. That is the first AP of dwarrowdelf. Also, I hate to be nitpicking, but its spelled and pronounced Rivendell, not Rivendale. Just thought you might want to know when posting a video title with it.

I do also enjoy your videos. Good job.

Yeah, I forget what it is called. It is the one with the big white wolves that can not be blocked by allies and deal 1 dmg on declare defender.

Please, it's "Vil-ya", just liked it's spelled.

As far as the deck goes, Putting a Master of the Forge or two in the deck can eliminate the problem that Imladris Stargazer has. I used to run a similar deck, but with Mirlonde instead of Frodo and a metric ton of elves. Glaurung has a video of a similar deck.

haha.. I've always been around.. Pop in to steal deck ideas that kind of thing.. I'm having a LoTR revival at my place at the mo. So expect more vids and chat from me!

Thanks for the input.. here are some of my thoughts on the matter.

 

The problem with Master of the Forge in this particular deck is the dead draw. While yes, any card that shuffles the deck gives Stargazer a great boost. The fact is that in most games you are drawing 2 cards a turn, and this is really strong as you have a 2 card peak, 2 card draw. That is pretty strong. Also, due to the threat requirements of this deck you need Will of the West to cycle Gandalf and threat reduction events. This card also shuffles the deck. So you can basically use it for this same purpose and free up any slots you were using on Master. You have 2 mulligans, a stargaze, that is a 17 card peak (kind of) plus you have normal draw AND 2 optional shuffles with Will of the West for another 10 card peak. .... It is pretty rare for the combo to not come out and get stuck in that stargaze problem

 

As for the heroes... well I went with 2 spirit as I wanted the opportunity to cast a greeting for 6 threat reduction every single round. Each turn I get 3 spirit (with Vilya). Frodo is a great choice for this quest as in Stage 2 there are no engagement checks so you do not have to worry about threat that much, and in Stage 3 there is no new encounter cards so you can plan exactly what you are doing at the start of the turn, meaning that again.. threat gain is not really an issue. I think it is one of the "best" quest to abuse his ability.

That's fine. But I'm not talking about getting the combo out or this quest in particular. I'm talking about the power of the deck in the long run. Just after refresh I tap stargazer to arrange the top five:

1. Cheap event

2. Expensive card

3. Useful attachment

4. Blah

5. Blah

Draw phase, draw cheap event. Planning, exhaust Elrond and Vilya to out the expense card into play. Then exhaust Master to get the attachment and stir the deck. The exact order can be mixed up depending on the situation, but you get three great cards a turn, rinse and repeat. (Vilya can play Greetings too.)

It's a powerful deck no doubt, and Frodo can certainly help on quests where you risk having a fatty engage you early. But I think in terms of general power you are better off having an extra lore resource per turn because generally the lore cards are the expensive ones.

cool cool, yes that is a strong way to go.. assuming you have attachment targets, which this deck has very few. Tthe thing is as I ma using a restricted card pool anyway, it is hard to make "power decks" and on top of that I design a new deck for each quest so there is some variety in the videos. So they are kind of tailored.

 

There are very few lore cards in the deck. Most are in fact Tactics and nearly completely rely on Vilya to pay for them. The only cards that require a high cost that need easy casting is really the spirit event -  O Elbereth! Gilthonial! @4xSpirit. and The Galadhrim's Greeting @3xSpirit.

 

Also this quest the shadow cards a pretty weak and can mainly be ignored, apart from a few acceptations. One of those acceptations bounces a tapped body into your hand. With 2 spirit Heroes from turn 1 you are able to bounce stargazer and then put her back down at the start of the next round.

Nice game! But it doesn't matter, for me, if you take your time (especially for reading the text on some enemy cards that you might miss... wink, wink), and if the video is a little longer. You always play in a relax fashion, anyways.  ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

The deck can function a LOT better than it did in the video. It was really late getting the Belt out and also the key card in the deck is really the Mapmaker guy.. you can use the crazy resource gen to quest exactly as needed to stall to get the condition killer dwarves out and then run home the last 2 sages in quick succession. In this video though it took like 8 turns or something to get the belt and the mapmaker didn't come out till the last turn. Pretty crazy... oh well.

The last video I posted while I won the quest, the deck performed very badly. Snow Shoes [http://goo.gl/4wW3OS] can in fact really own this quest, but last game I had some really bad draws not getting Mapmaker or the Belt till well into the late game.

Thought I would do another video just to show the deck functioning a little more normally. For speed sake I just pushed this on out in LackeyCCG instead of using the real cards.
