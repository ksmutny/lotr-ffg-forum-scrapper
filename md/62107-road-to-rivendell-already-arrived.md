When people say that an AP is at the store, I like to check ebay for previews.  Search ebay for Road to Rivendell.

 I just saw the hero and a couple other new cards.  Including a Spirit Rohan ally.

Wow.

Those are some great Hero deck cards...

Elladan is exactly the opposite of Elorir too like people have previously suggested.  Tactic Hero for the win.

Love the new Rivendell Blade...

 Daaaamn that was fast :-D

Thanks for the pointer about eBay and the preview...Elladan is one sweet deal, comboed with his brother. Can't wait to get my hands on this expansion ! The sword of Rivendell is also pretty powerful !

Lure of Moria is a nice upgrade for people who love to roll with dwarves.

## 10 [Bomb on March 20, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62107-road-to-rivendell-already-arrived/?do=findComment&comment=607998)

The best part of Rivendell Blade is that it has an End of the Phase effect.  So, if I were able to attack an enemy engaged with the other player with the Ranged first(with Rivendell Blade attached of course), then the other player would get the benefit of the -2 DEF when it's his/her turn to attack that same enemy.

Lure seems nice. The Rohan ally perhaps less so. I thought they are done for a while, I really like the Rohan theme but did not know it is still going on in this cycle. I would not mind seeing one or two more Eagles though, as we are bound to given Gwaihir has not appeared.

Clearly Elladan and Elrohir talk to each other in some secret code that none of us are meant to understand. This will surely be fixed in future printings, so get your hands on these valuable collectables while you can!

Only Elladan and Elrohir have the typo. Some sort of weird shared genetic defect.

p.s. Lure of Moria is bonkers. The one drawback of using Dain is that there usually aren't many great uses for Leadership resources in a Dwarf deck. Well, problem solved. Dwarves are already very good, and this just makes them better.

 I'd like to throw my weight behind Elladan and Elrohir. A lot of people are complaining about them not being very exciting. I think they're great. I am a twin and my brother and I used to do everything together. We even dressed the same through our freshman year at college (only we wore different colors). So to me, seeing these two characters that are "the same but different" is very exciting. I think I'll definitely use them. I'll probably try to take them through the whole Shadows of Mirkwood Cycle and see how I do. These guys are gonna be great!

## 33 [lleimmoen on March 21, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62107-road-to-rivendell-already-arrived/?do=findComment&comment=608215)

Well, I was the one complaining. I really like them both from the art and theme point of view. I am guessing though they won't be that strong unless (or until) we get some Noldor trait support cards. As they are right now, they really seem costly for what they can do. I hope to be proven wrong in time cause I would really love to play a Noldor deck.

Woohoo! A 5 cost non-unique ally! Just what the miner deck was asking for!

Next thing we need: a 5 cost spirit event that reduces threat (maybe reduce every player's threat by 4?).

As for the critic about creating cards useless for solo-player, I agree with RichSabre on this. Having a different text / effect depending on the number of players would be nice... although in a couple years, it won't really matter since we'll have plenty of unused player cards anyway, whether playing solo or multi-player.

Some thoughts on the scenario after playing it twice (minor spoilers included):

It's quite fun, if not particularly difficult. FFG rates it at a 4 (so roughly parallel to The Hunt for Gollum, The Hills of Emyn Muil, etc.). I'd say it's probably a bit more challenging than other, similarly-rated quests. Ambush turns out to be a pretty fun mechanic, especially in conjunction with one particular location. Plus, most of the enemies have nasty effects that trigger whenever they engage a player. Since several shadow effects are of the "return attacking enemy to the staging area" variety, these engagement triggers can quickly become incredibly annoying. One word of advice: don't get too attached to your attachments (ha!). They probably won't be around for very long. 

All in all, a nice addition to the collection. I'd rate it a notch below The Redhorn Gate, but above most of the Shadows of Mirkwood cycle. Overall, between a solid scenario and an excellent assortment of player cards, Road to Rivendell is one of the best APs released to date.

You mean Into the Pit? I wouldn't say Dunhere's quite as good on the Road to Rivendell, especially since most of the enemies have solid defense and a decent amount of hit points. Still, he can frequently pick off some of those bounced enemies before they discard more of your attachments or damage more of your characters.

Also, I really like the treacheries in this scenario. They can all be pretty nasty--Sleeping Sentry is one of the most backbreaking cards ever printed--but they are also inventive and flavorful. Orc Ambush is one of the best encounter card designs to date.

I like the theme of Mirkwood but I agree about playability. Rhosgobel for instance, I think that was a neat idea to rescue an Eagle but I get bored by that quest easily because it is a quick run through, constantly hoping to draw a card or two, no fun. Actually the only two quests I replay from the cycle are Conflict at the Carrock and Return to Mirkwood. I do not find Emyn Muil that bad (as others have expressed) but it is just questing and getting rid of locations, not much else.

starhawk77 said:

No, definately didn't mean Into the Pit. Seventh Level has both of the sets that have "add Goblin X to the staging" area as Shadow Effects (ItP doesn't have Plundering Goblins), so there are at least 10 shadow effects that add an enemy in the staging area. Into the Pit IMO was more location-oriented, hence the Cave Torch, Seventh Level is about fight, fight, fight. Seventh Level is really the only quest where I've not hated Dunhere.

Ah, that makes sense. I'll admit I've never used Dunhere in that particular scenario, but I see how he could definitely come in handy. Anyway, he's pretty good against the K-D goblins and their puny defense/health stats, since he can usually kill them in one or two shots. The RtR enemies are generally a bit more beefy, so Unseen Strike and Dunedain Mark will be necessary if you want Dunhere to be super helpful. Still, it might be worth it, since the forced effects I alluded to are pretty unpleasant. No need to weather them more than once if you can avoid doing so.

What's the name of the shop?

Do you know if they already got the english version? (I can't stand the german translations lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif] )

Am besten du rufst an.

Khazad und Düsterwald haben sie auch in  Englisch.......sollt wohl für den Zwergenbinge Zyklus auch zutreffen.

Can anyone post a pic (or a link) of the Road To Rivendell-Arwen? Did they create another version (both text and art) of her for this quest or were they re-using the redhorn gate-arwen?

RtR features the exact same Arwen card found in The Redhorn Gate. They're completely interchangeable. I was a bit surprised by that. But whereas you generally don't have to worry about getting Arwen killed during TRG, she dies VERY easily in RtR.

He had Redhorn Gate 4 days after release and Road to Rivendell was there a few hours before FFG posted there official release announcement.

And 9€ per pack is the best price I know of. 

I think the english version is an additional 2 euros and seems to arrive with the german one.

For anyone who has it already:

Is anyone else finding it EXTREMELY hard? I consider myself something of a vet at this game, but this one is BRUTAL! Anyone else having the same experience?

 I find the first stage to be brutal. The second and third didn´t make that much trouble.

I think the difficulty is highly contingent on whether or not a few key cards resolve. Sleeping Sentry is usually game over if you don't cancel it. Similarly, there are a few shadow effects that damage allies, so Arwen will die FAST unless you have some way to deal with shadow cards. Orc Ambush can also be really hard to deal with.

Overall, I didn't find it particularly tough, but that was largely due to the fact that I run Eleanor. I didn't draw into A Test of Will, and she totally saved my bacon by canceling a Sleeping Sentry and an Orc Ambush. Any game-breaking treacheries are a lot less scary with her along for the ride.

On the other hand, my normally solid Dwarf deck has yet to defeat this scenario. I just can't seem to keep Arwen alive. So perhaps RtR is tougher than I initially thought.

I haven't gotten past the first stage yet, so that may very well be true...haha. gran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif]

 

Yeah, I was trying it Elladan/Elrohir for maximum flavor and just to see what they can do....no dice whatsoever. Like you said Starhawk, I don't think this quest can be beaten without Eleanor, A Test of Will, and Hasty Stroke (or actually Burning Brand would be stellar),

 I had Bilbo and the two brothers. Burning Brand on Elrohir is great. 

Orc Ambush was terrible for me. Once it returned 7 orcs.

Yep, just had a similar thing happen. Six orcs returned to play, four of whom promptly ambushed me, discarding four of my attachments and dealing out four damage to my characters. Just bad, bad news.

I have only played it once, but it seems like a Lore/Spirit deck with threat reduction handles 'Road' fairly easily, even with a rough opening draw (I got hit with Cerbain + Sleeping Sentry on turn 1).

Do you think the designers actually spend a great deal of time playtesting these scenarios against various solo decks?

I'd be mildly surprised if they even playtested it _once_ against a solo deck.

nah they must do- i cant talk for RtR but redhorn is perfectly balanced for solo play, return to mirkwood they probably didnt, all the others are ok again

I see nothing to indicate that these scenarios have not been tested.  In fact, everything post Mirkwood seems to show much more awareness for how the game is actually played.

 I have tried Road to Rivendell three times now. All were solo games; twice was with decks i beat the Redhorn Gate with and one that was an attempt at using secrecy.

I lost all three games, twice was due to getting Sleeping Sentry as a Shadow Card.

I won my first three games, but got hit hard and lost the last two.  If you get drawn into combat, the encounter deck is just brutal.

I don't think I'm alone in the impression that Redhorn is a DL6 and Road to Rivendell is a DL4!   I think I've lost Redhorn once, and that was because I wasn't careful and lost Arwen for questing agressively, but in RtR I've won only twice out of 6-7, and in one of the wins I didn't come across any darn Sleeping Sentry.  To quote someone in the Cardboard of the Rings fan page, just imagine how brutal that guy would be if he was fully awake!!  LOL!

All Difficult rates is working for 2 players usually. So in solo game all quest start from KD is quite difficult. And this is good!!!

But often when you play 2 or more player quest sis quite easy for  most of the time( i mean new quests start from KD).

Very good example is difficult 3 quest from KD(seventh level). For solo can be really hard and looks much more then difficult 3 but for 2 or more players is walk in the park!

For now game is really ok for solo game( i mean from KD and New cycle). But still is too easy for 2 or more player( anyway is more difficult then previous cycle).

Next step for Designers make game as same cool for 2 or more players as is cool now for solo game. And game will be ok in my opinion.

Still waiting for RTR..........

I still think some quests are easier solo than coop. I have not played Escape from Moria that much but with all those: X equals number of players, it must get really brutal for four players. Same is Osgiliath or even Hunt. I think they did not need those difficulty levels at all as they are oft misleading.

Agree with you too. Better they make difficult level with some another idea. Still need to work on it anyway in my opinion.

Yeah, each quest could have a quick description, like: QUEST HEAVY or COMBAT HEAVY or HEALING REQUIRED or LOCATION EXPLORATION... just an idea but as we agreed, the numbers are rather off.

Normaly i play solo or 2 player game. Really rare i play 3 player game. I remember we play Oaguliath 3 players and it was really cool!

But i can image FFM with 4 player! Sounds really brutal!! Not sure about HFG last time we play 3 players and reveal 4 cards instead 3 and still win very easy.

Osgiliath, Flight from Moria, Return to mirkwood maybe? should be more hard with 3 or 4 players in my opinion cose they done to be more powerful with more players. Really need to try FFM with 4 players!

I actually think Road to Rivendell is a DL4 and Redhorn slightly harder, maybe a DL5.  I've played Road to Rivendell solo 4 times and have won each game.  The only other adventure pack I have a perfect 100% win rate against is Hills of Emyn Muil.  I think the key is the heroes I picked (Denethor, Elrohir and Elladan).  Denethor is really key as he can help you dodge some of the nasty cards and the twins are very effective with their ability to ready after attack and defense (plus the stats boost they get playing together).  I also loaded up my deck with all of the encounter and shadow effect nullifiers.  Unlike the Hills of Emyn Muil though I found this quest challenging and very enjoyable.  It's probably the quest where I had to constantly make the most tactical decisions - deciding when to engage an enemy and which characters to quest with versus hold back for combat in the event of an ambush makes for many tough decisions.

 I finally beat Road to Rivendell, but it was also the first time that I tried it with a deck that had that quest specifically in mind. I used Eowyn and the elf twins. They're really great!
