[I think all my text vanished for some reason when I posted the above, so just in case it can't be fixed by a mod...]

Any cards that feature the fellowship icon in the card text, instead feature a smiling emoji. It mostly seems to affect the above event card and some of the campaign and quest cards.

So I looked through the entire set of cards and found the same misprint on the following cards:

 

Card #13 The Three Hunters (event, three copies)

Card #20 Palantir of Orthanc (boon)

Card #69 Follow the Orcs (quest, front only)

Card #71 The Lord of the Rings Part 7 (campaign, back only)

 

I don't think I missed any. (But I didn't look too closely as I didn't want to spoil the game before I had a chance to play it.)

 

This misprint appears to be newly introduced as the same copy of the event card on The Card Game DB doesn't have the misprint.

 

Also, I have recent reprints of the previous two saga expansions, and they don't have the same problem. And the manual for The Treason of Saruman is unaffected.

A few others had the same problems with this set. It seems a recent batch slip by quality control. Contact Asmodee here [https://parts.asmodeena.com/partsrequests/] and they'll send you some replacements.

Thanks for that.

 

Do you know if they are they likely to send replacements to the UK?

I don't know why not. They sell their products there.

I can't blame the misprint.

That's also what happens anytime I talk about :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] Aragorn

Omg, this is hilarious. Hold on to it, I'm sure :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] Aragorns gonna cost pretty penny as rare collectibles in the future.

Considering that :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png] Aragorn is depicted in the art...

Just checked all the Aragorn cards and they are all 🙁 Aragorn at best, so this is clearly a hint at a future Spirit Aragorn who's 🙂.
