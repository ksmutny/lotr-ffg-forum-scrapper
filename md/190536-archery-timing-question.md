In Blood of Gondor nightmare, there is "Uruk Marksman" enemy with Archery 3. At beginning of quest phase (via quest card) you can turn over your hidden cards. If you do and this enemy is one, he triggers by dealing 3 damage and returns to staging area. At that point, does his Archery 3 trigger?

Â 

I lean toward no, as I consider the "at the start of combat phase" (when archery takes place) to have come and gone, and he wasn't in play at that time. But I'm not 100% sure, as I can see an argument the other way too, saying the "at the start of combat phase" is ongoing. Thoughts?

When multiple effects are triggered at the same time you can choose the order to trigger them one at a time. So in this case you could start the combat phase by assigning archery damage, then deal a shadow card to each engaged enemy, and finally decide to reveal hhidden cards (which won't get a shadow card OR assign archery damage since you've already finished those triggered steps).

Ah, sure. Didn't think of that since there was no Archery at the time, but it makes sense to think of it that way. Good call. Thanks.
