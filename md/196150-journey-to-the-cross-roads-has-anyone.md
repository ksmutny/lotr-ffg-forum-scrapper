... beaten that quest in pure sol? If yes, how?

 

I even think it's impossible to beat without letting those 3 Oliphaunts into the Black gate....

I almost did, but made acritical all mistake at the end. It's crazy hard, but with a lot of luck it can be done. It needs a scaling factor for sure and remember that you don't lose until there are 4 Harads under the Black Gate.

Yep, it's super hard. I did won once but I made 2 mistakes that canceled the game.

 

I will try again with a traps deck and Gondor heroes and allies (I'm in campaign mode, so when I change heroes, I also get the starting threat penalty... Yikes!).

Twice today with Leadermir, Damrod and Sam, just wrote about it on the Spider lair topic. Had other three close loses and a lot devastating ones :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] .  

 

It is very hard indeed and need a bit of luck on first hand (steward of Gondor or a couple of traps are looked for on my deck)

Yes, I taught of Hama! I'll also check the Leadermir, Damrod and Sam deck! Thanks for the suggestions!

 

This quest and Nightmare Journey Down the Anduin made me sware (a nice mix of english and French Canadian bad words) out loud at the game. This one is super annoying, and some of the shadow effects... "put under the Black gate or it makes another attack"... AAAARRGGH!!!
