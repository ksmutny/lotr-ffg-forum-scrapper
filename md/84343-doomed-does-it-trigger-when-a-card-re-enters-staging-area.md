# [Doomed - Does it trigger when a card re-enters staging area?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/84343-doomed-does-it-trigger-when-a-card-re-enters-staging-area/)

The rules say that Doomed triggers when a card "is revealed during the staging step of the quest phase".  Nothing is mentioned of what happens if a Doomed card is returned to the staging area (by the Outer Ridge shadow effect, for example).

Does Doomed re-trigger each time a card re-enters the staging area, or only when it is revealed during the staging step?

The rules on this 2 words are clear:

 

 Surge

When an encounter card with the surge keyword is
revealed during the staging step of the quest phase,
reveal 1 additional card from the encounter deck.
Resolve the surge keyword immediately after resolving
any when revealed effects on the card.
 
Doomed X
If an encounter card with the doomed keyword is
revealed during the staging step of the quest phase,
each player must raise his threat level by the specified
value.
 
So they only apply when the card is revealed during the staging step

 

In both rules there are any reference to being added to stagging area

Thanks for the clarification!

I think in one of the blogs or CotR videos there was a mention that Outer Ridge forces Doomed to trigger again, but I guess we all make mistakes!

Except of Steward's Fear cards (i do not have them), there is no such effect on any card…

FAQ

(1.01) Encounter Keywords

Surge, Doomed, and Guarded keywords should be resolved any time the card on which they occur 

is revealed from the encounter deck, including during setup.

so basically they follow the same rules as when revealed cards…so if a card says 'return and reveal the top card of the discard pile to the staging area' then they would occur (its of course unlikely it would say reveal in this way)

but otherwise they wouldnt

thanks for the clarification

To be more correct. tThis rules wak appy in 1.4 FAQ. Before sure domed and Guarded apply any time when cards enters play. So they change the rules i dont know why. since this make many thinks more easy i still play by the old rules.

The FAQ seams clear.. but there are at least 3 rule reversals I have seen form in this game where they have completely changed the rules form one faq to the other. I always played that surge and doom only trigger on reveal.. and NOT when going back to staging area. The keyword "reveal" is pretty well defined as coming off the encounter deck. Still I am absolutely certain that guarded triggered anytime a objective went into the staging area from any gamezone.
