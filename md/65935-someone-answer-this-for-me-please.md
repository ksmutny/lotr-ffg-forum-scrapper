ok so after shadow and flame we get hobbit deluxe pack 1…..ok

so this is 1 pack with no monthly packs after it? so what happens then….do we get no packs, or do we get another deluxe pack to start a new cycle a month afer hobbit number 1? so then we will have two deluxes back to back- this is the only way i can it working- seems a bit strange though- or have i missed some news about this

It would mean three deluxes in a row (or two sagas and a deluxe) which is what seems most likely now.

Yeah, we don't really know yet but I think many of us are curious.

Either:

1. The next cycle will work off of the Hobbit deluxe box, like we're used to.

2. The next cycle will work off of a new, not yet revealed deluxe box.

3. The next cycle will work independently, with just it's own cards, or using encounter sets from the core set.

 

Do we know yet for sure if both Hobbit deluxe boxes are coming this year? I thought I saw someone say that but I can't remember. If that's true, I can't see them releasing a 3rd deluxe as well just to launch a new cycle as that's probably too many expensive boxes too close together to expect people to buy.

My bet is on number 1.

i see- i would have said 1 - but i dont remember seeing any reference to the hobbit being a proper cycle- i thought they were sticking with it being just the 2 boxes?

Yeah, I think it is as well, but they could still use some of the encounter sets from it depending on how they divided them up I think.

Like how we didn't re-use the core set Dol Guldur encounter set that has the objectives, but we did re-use the core set generic spiders, orcs, and Sauron's eye sets in quite a few other quests.

 

But who knows. Maybe they'll do something like number 3 then.

i see- that make alot of sense- so i guess the question is what will the quest line be? if we re already doing the hobbit in the twe deluxe packs whats the other going to be about…..the shire (oh how i wish…..)

Yeah, I mean, if the next cycle is places that are even kind of close like the Shire, Bree, etc then even though the Hobbit deluxe boxes are stand alone I could see them making use out of the more generic encounter sets from that.

Though the more we talk about it the more that doesn't sound quite right either. I have no clue, lol.

We should be finding out soon enough though. It seems like we're just about due for a news article revealing the next cycle. I think we got news of Dwarrowdelf way before it was out and currently we only have 2 packs left in this one.

I think they did say the second Hobbit saga is coming this year. I even thought it is coming after the first with no adventure packs in between but that impression may be wrong.

this is getting confusing haha……can anyone remember the dates they gave on the news article for the second box ?

Yeh rich, i can see the location cards being The Green Dragon, The Ivy Bush, then The Floating Log in Frogmorton!! "Forced" - "For every inn you travel to, every character must decrease its willpower by 1".  ( I can see their desire to quest diminishing with every tankard of wifebeater that passes their lips).sorpresa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sorpresa.gif]

Can't wait to see the new cycle. It is due in september if they release shadow and flame in july and Hobbit 1 in august… New expansion in september and new adventure pack in october… Wouhou !

Then heroes would be equally reparted in spheres before the new cycle. Assuming we get a lore hero in S&F (Elrond like other guesses ?) 1 per sphere in Hobbit 1 and 2 hero in new expansion (leadership & tactics).

Which leads me directly to my final point : Leadership and tactics heroes means Gondor/Rohan to me ! Wouhou again !!

 

 

I pasted my post from another thread here since it fits really good the topic ;-)

I will only add that the two hobbit boxes are supposed to be released this year. One article mentioned "later this year" so I assume when the film will come out. They also said that these boxes were independant from the normal processus, so I think the wildguesses above can still be true !

 I'll just cast my thoughts out there that we're gonna see the two Hobbit boxes released before we get the next cycle started. But I don't think they'll be just a month apart. Considering APs give you one scenario per month and The Hobbit boxes will have 3 scenarios each, they may be as much as 3 months apart and the next cycle will start with a new deluxe expansion in January.

Technically, one could easilly "fuel" the following cycle with some of the more generic encounter cards from the Hobbit. But it would mean two things, first, everyone neading the Hobbit in order to play the cycle (similar happened with Dwarrodelf anyways), and second, the cycle would have to spin about the same regions as the Hobbit. I would like the idea but there is no indication that this shall happen.

 I'd like to see AP that use encounter sets from both the Core and Kazzud-Dum.

Oh totally. 9 quests that deal with underground (well 3 of them in the close proximity) is more than enough for me. Air! Please!
