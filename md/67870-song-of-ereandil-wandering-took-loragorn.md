# [Song of Ereandil, Wandering Took &amp; Loragorn?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/67870-song-of-ereandil-wandering-took-loragorn/)

In a 2 player game, if my partner has Aragorn and we keep swapping a wandering took back and forth until he either gets to 49 threat or I get to 0 threat all the while using Song of Ereandil to reduce my threat increase, then he can use Aragorn's ability to reset his threat.  I'd then have an insanely low threat and he'd have his starting threat.

 

Possible?

Wandering Took let´s the current controller reduce his threat by 3 to give the card to another player who raises his threat by 3 and, at the same time gains control with the card.

If the new controller was to trigger the ability to switch WT back to the original player then he would reduce his own threat by 3 (since he is not the controller of  WT) and increase the original players threat by 3 again. Thus switching WT back and forth between the same players would only make them alternate between threat levels.

Afaik you can´t use WT to keep increasing the same players threat (and continue decreasing the other players threat)

Just now noticed the part about song of Eärendil.

Seems to me this wasn´t the intention of those cards but can´t remember anything rules-wise to disallow it

 Keep in mind that using Song of Earendil, will increase 1 threat level to the player who plays the card and will decrease 1 threat level to player who have previosly raised it.

So when you give control of WT to the other player, you decrease your threat level by 3 and the other player increase his threat level by 3.

If then you play a Song of Earendil, you will raise your threat by 1 and the other player will decrease his by 1.

 

So, in pratical terms, if you use this combo you will decrease your threat by 2 and your partner increase his by 2.

 

If this combo his used back and forth, it will not have the reduce one player threat to 0 and the other player to 49 and then use Loragorn to reduce his threat to his original threat.

 

Pratically:

- A has 29 threat and B has 31;

- A gives WT to B and reduces threat to 26 and B increases threat to 34;

- Then A plays Song of Earendil and increases threat to 27 and B reduces threat to 33;

 

Hope that this long explain let you understand better this combo you described…

Sounds like you´re describing song of eälendil as an event when it is an attachement.

The net gain isn´t great but still there and bot SoE and WT can be activated numerous times.

Or did I misinterpret your intented meaning?

Bad english of my part.

 

When said "play Song od Earendil", I meant "used response from Song of Earendil"

 

Thanks for the reminder…

And to continue this example:

- B gives WT to A and reduces threat to 30 and A increases threat to 30;

 

- A gives WT to B and reduces threat to 27 and B increases threat to 33;

 

- Then A uses the response of Song of Earendil and increases threat to 28 and B reduces threat to 32;

- B gives WT to A and reduces threat to 29 and A increases threat to 31;

- A gives WT to B and reduces threat to 28 and B increases threat to 32;

 

- Then A uses the response of Song of Earendil and increases threat to 29 and B reduces threat to 31;

 

 

 

- B gives WT to A and reduces threat to 28 and A increases threat to 32;

 

- A gives WT to B and reduces threat to 29 and B increases threat to 31;

- Then A uses the response of Song of Earendil and increases threat to 30 and B reduces threat to 30;

- B gives WT to A and reduces threat to 27 and A increases threat to 33;

 

Rinse and repeat, so you can see that B's threat is reducing all the time while A's increasing.  And it is all happening in the same action window, as none of the cards used needs to be exhausted.

 The short answer is: Yes. If you have Song of Earendil (and the Took ofc) you can increase your threat by X and lower your partners threat by X (if he plays along, that is). Then use Aragorn, no problem.

Now if you BOTH have a Song of Ereandil you can freely adjust the threat between the two of you whenever you have an action window. Think of the possibilites: Both decks in secrecy mode during planning phase, both decks below 35 threat during quest phase. then adjust threat during engagement phase for perfect enemy distribution.
