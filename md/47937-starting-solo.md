Hi All

very impressed with this game. I am about to start playing for the first time and will be playing solo mostly. Is there any cards, like the wandering Took, that you guys have a "ruling on" for solo play?

many thanks

regards mic

I haven't done anything different for him when playing solo. He will quest or take a bullet so to speak if need be, depending on the situation. Even co-op I imagine he can be situational in lowering your threat but increasing another player's threat.

If you mean are they modified in any way for solo? No. Solo's just a bit tougher than multiplayer.

That said, Wandering Took is a pretty good deal even with no ability.

So playing the wandering Took solo you would just lower your threat by 3 and disregard the bit about raising the other players threat?

No. Wandering Took's ability does nothing when you're playing solo.

You can only chose yourself as player to give him to, so at the sme time you lower AND raise your threat by 3. As already said by a previous poster: it's as he had no ability at all. But he is a nice ally for 2 ressources :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

As the others have said, there is no inherent differences in cards when playing solo.  It is, however, more difficult to accomplish the Quests, especially the last 2.  Most new players just pick one of the 4 starting decks to learn the game.  This is OK for the 1st part 'Mirkwood.  The next two get progressively more difficult with basic decks.  The easiest way to increase the potency of a deck, without completely building a new deck, is to add the maximum allowed number of Gandalfs. (3)  Being the most powerful card, the more times you can use him, the better.  Cards that bring back Allies, or bring them in more cheaply, become a premium.  You will have lots of fun working out good combos and will get better as you learn the potential dangers.  Enjoy!  Cheers!
