# [Card Question - Warg Lair](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62254-card-question-warg-lair/)

 I have a question in response to a revealed effect of - Warg Lair. (Misty Mountains 14/15 while in play with scenario The Redhorn Gate & Road to Rivendell.)

 

"When Revealed:  Search the counter deck & discard pile for 1 copy of Mountain Warg & add it to the staging area, if able.  Shuffle the encounter deck."

 

From my knowledge, there is no card named "Mountain Warg" in the game yet.  Do I just shuffle the encounter deck when this card is played from the encounter deck?  Am I not reading this card correctly?  Help please!

 

Thanks,

 Never mind I just answered my own question.  It is a creature.  I was thinking "Mountain Warg" as an actual location.  I feel stupid now.  aplauso.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/aplauso.gif]

Another question:

 

What means "if able"? When is it not possible to find one of these moster hamsters to place them in the staging area? Seems a bit uneccessary to me...

the out of the wild removes them from play so that could be for that

 Or if they're already all in play.
