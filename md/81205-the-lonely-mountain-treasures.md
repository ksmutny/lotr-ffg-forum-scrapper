In the scenario "The Lonely Mountain" , is there any way to get more then 1 Treasure card and discard the Lonely Mountain? I am a little confused…

After questing successfully and subsequently burgling successfully, you have the option to proceed to quest stage 3. You could stay in quest 2B as long as you like and eventually emptying the mountain of treasure.

It’s tricky because it’s normally not terribly difficult to get that first treasure. However, you are not usually built up enough to handle the fight with Smaug so soon. On the flip side, the treachery cards and Smaug progress accumulation can get out of hand in a hurry.

In a recent four player run with this quest, we acquired the first treasure (Thror’s Cup), but then one of the guys insisted we stick around for more. Against the other three’s better judgment, we listened. Before we knew what happened, we were burgling unsuccessfully, and being sent to the 4B “punishment” quest stage a few times over. We eventually threated out. This gave rise to our new catch phrase “Take the cup and run”.

Yup. The threat level of the Lonely Mountain also gets higher as you snag more treasure. If you're not totally going to get roasted by Smaug on stage 3, it seems like it generally behooves you to advance after your first burgling.
