Hi guys,

I really don't know why I'm asking this but anyway.

Response:.......Shuffle the rest of the searched cards back into their owners' decks.

Do you just insert the 4 cards randomly into the deck or do you shuffle the entire deck?

Regards,

Shuffle the entire deck. Otherwise, you know (approximately) where are the cards you insert into. And I find difficult to randomly put 4 cards in a deck without shuffling it
