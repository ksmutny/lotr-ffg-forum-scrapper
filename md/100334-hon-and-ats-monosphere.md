Just curious: Has anyone completed all three Heirs of Numenor quests and the whole Against the Shadow cycle with strictly monosphere decks? I really enjoy using them for those quests, since technically the theme for that cycle was monosphere. But I find it difficult to beat some of them... Has anyone ever done it?

What do you mean by STRICTLY monosphere?

 

- all heroes from one sphere with no Songs/other ways of gaining extra icons?

 

- no cards at all from other spheres?

 

- or something else?

I can't vouch and say I completed them all with JUST my monosphere decks, but I know I completed quite a few with my Tactics and Spirit monosphere decks. Some of them this worked out better than others. I know I really liked it when like Orc Arbelesters or The Master's Malice would show up. They're sorta just difficult to beat no matter what decks you use I think.

I would say all heroes from one sphere, but songs/ways of gaining extra icons are allowed. Sometimes you need threat reduction in a fighting deck or healing in an Outlands deck or whatever.  And yeah, they are difficult. I played Peril in Pelargir two-player the other day nearly five times and we lost each time. Bad luck, or just bad deck building on my part? Probably the second.  :wacko: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wacko.png]

Everything except Into Ithilien with mono Spirit and mono Tactics.

 

Edit: Correction, I used mono Lore and mono Leadership for Druadan Forest

Works well two-player for different tasks, and its a fun change from trying to do everything in one deck. For solo, hopeless.

I've won every quest except The Morgul Vale with mono-Leadership (Outlands: Hirluin, Boromir, Imrahil).

jjeagle: Nice. How did you structure your Outlands deck? Whenever I build one, I seem to have a lot of trouble with card draw.

Raven1015: Into Ithilien is horrible. I've only played it a few times, since I'm too afraid to try and beat it.

Hi Legolas18,

 

I'm not sure what jjeagle uses but when ran mono Leadership Outlands. I used Hurin, Theodred & Balin as the heroes. Valiant Sacrifice and Lord of Morthond as the main card draw along with Erestor, if required Gandalf (including Sneak attack). - Never really had any problems with card draw.
