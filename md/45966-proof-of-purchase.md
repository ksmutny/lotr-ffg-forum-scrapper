# [Proof of Purchase??????](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45966-proof-of-purchase/)

Been meaning to ask this. The core set has a small detachable square(comes with the tokens, threat markers, etc) that says "proof of purchase". Anyone knows what we are supposed to do with it?

Hold on to it for now. Who knows maybe there will be some kind of redemption that will require it. Or maybe it will end up in the recycling bin.

Something like "here is a copy of all the cards we only one copy of in the core set, so now you only have to buy 2 cores instead of three to build a deck with 3 Beorns" would be nice.

One can dream...

More likely it will be used for online promotions and such. Maybe itll be used to give more forum points?

It's nice to have dreams I guess, but it is very unlikely that something like this will happen. You should rather think of the proof of purchase as a serial-number of your game. If pieces are missing or there is some damage you will need it to claim replacements. If anything is in order you might not need it, but I guess it's still better to hold on to it ;-)

Its a relatively new service it seems, the Thrones core set I bought last christmas didnt have a proof of purchase. I really hope its something more exciting than just a troubleshooting number. Hopefully it will involve fabulous prizes =P

Almost all recent FFG titles I bought have had this little token. I guess they can ask for it if you need replacement parts or if you are missing parts etc.
