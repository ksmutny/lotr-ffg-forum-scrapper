After the video tutorial and the rules, now I'm waiting for the release of this game. Many sources say that this game should be published in April - but that's not 100% sure.

But when I look at it I want to play it so much. But I was thinking about htis game and I would like to see in it so places, enemies and characters.

What do You, all fans,  think of this - will we see:

- Moria (it would be great to get a scenario or a pack of secenarios set in this Old Dwarf Mine)

- Balrog (nice main enemy in a Moria scenario)

- Uruk-hai (it would be great to see those as enemies)

- Saruman (now this is for me one of the main and very importent characters in Middle-earth)

- Isengard (if Saruman would be in the game than this location is a must)

 **** the timeline, I wanna see Smaug.

For characters, I want Beorn the skin changer.

We will see Saruman and Uruk-hai for sure.Moria can be a place we will visite but as for Balrog i dont think so except if ffg wants to expand the scenarios and use Lotr  events.

As for my self i want to see Galadriel,Radagast,the Eagles of Manwe,rangers of the North,Gondolin and maybe some events in the East helping Palando and Alatar.

**** you FFG release this game as soon as possible

We've already seen Glorfindel, so that would be my number one wish which will obviously be granted. I'd love to see Bombadil incorporated somehow into the game. It'd be neat if there was a way to do an adventure in and around Rivendell. I definitely want to see King Bard and Dale fleshed out as well. I'm hoping for Mirkwood that we get to see the Dol Guldor and the White Council, although if memory serves the timeline wouldn't match up. 

## 6 [Toqtamish on March 29, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/44476-wish-list/?do=findComment&comment=445812)

I want to see the Balrog for sure.

And Minas Morgul would be cool too.

## 7 [gerateur on March 29, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/44476-wish-list/?do=findComment&comment=445859)

The Balrog, Moria and Smaug would we really nice, but if I remember correctly the lcg's timeline is set somewhere between The Hobbit events and the Lord of the Ring events.

This would actually mean no balrog AND no smaug. For my part I don't care so much about a strict timeline though ;-) It would be nice to have further Adventure Pack cycles based on locations...especially some locations that are not given much attention in the books.

 

## 9 [Toqtamish on March 29, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/44476-wish-list/?do=findComment&comment=445968)

Depending on how flexible their license is they could possibly add in other elements, like a different Balrog. ICE did with the Middle Earth Roleplaying game and ME:CCG. They did a really good job of adding in elements that fit what was already there but filled in a gap. But I doubt that FFG's license is quite that flexible. At least its not tied down by the movies.

## 10 [Darksbane on March 29, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/44476-wish-list/?do=findComment&comment=446050)

Regarding the Balrog, since the mines of moria obviously had been destroyed for a while and the timeline goes right up to the first book why wouldn't the balrog be available? You wouldn't be facing him as the fellowship but as another band of adventurers trying to make it through or out of the mine. I don't know much about the books so perhaps there is a reason.

## 11 [weaponxmerc on March 29, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/44476-wish-list/?do=findComment&comment=446078)

I'm a fan of the rangers of the north, as well as Faramir's rangers in Osgiliath, so I'd love to see stuff involving them. It would be cool to eventually be able to play out the entire LoTR trilogy in quest form, maybe split into 9 or so quests that could be played over a period of time.

Promblem here is not the timeline.Balrog's first appearence is at the year 1980 of the third age and ffg can use Balrog in this game.

Question here is how and why?Only dawrves have a reason to enter Moria and not as a party but as an army who wants to reclaim Khazad-Dum.If ffg wants to add some random scenarios and let us pass through the mines how you can face a Balrog with some random heroes?Only Gandalf,Glorfindel and maybe Galadriel(i am not sure about this i still searching in the books if Galadriel's powers can match a Balrog) can match a Balrog and is almost sure that they must sucrifice their selfs to kill him.So whats the point of a scenario with some random heroes facing Balrog?They can only face him and die and i dont realy want to see some randon heroes like Eleanor ,Bilbo and Theodred facing Balrog and kill him.

But thats my personal taste about a game based on Tolkien.The real answer to your question is that ffg can use Balrog in this game.

I was waiting this question to comelengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif].I think those who want to see Balrog in the game they want also to fight against him.Whats the point to have Balrog as a minion with stats and abilities if you can't fight him?

hm...the more I think of it, the more I realize, that I actually have quite high hopes of the game to provide the opportunity to experience some other stuff than we already know from the novels.

We know the Balrog from the books already and he was even a minion in the TCG. So I wouldn't be overly sad to learn that there won't be a Balrog and that there won't be any Moria. I would really rejoice in being able to visit some other locations and explore some quests not directly to the lotr storyline. Also I think this is where most of the potential lies for the game.

However, as mentioned before it also depends on the license that ffg has, since that will strongly govern the possible directions of the game to take.

Apart from setting related wishes, I really hope that some new mechanics will be introduced later on, enhancing the game exprience and increasing replayability.

And another item for the wishlist: A fun singleplayer experience. I would just love it, if could also really enjoy this alone. I also really hope that the adventure packs will introduce a lot of storytelling elements, that make questing a fun experience!

 

A lot of wishes, lol...maybe some of them are already addressed in the core set?

Oh ,you remember the text of the first Balrog?While you can spot the Balrog discard all other minionssorpresa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sorpresa.gif].Anyway Balrog without his artifacts wasn't realy a threat.Gandalf can cancel the skirmish with his staff and even Frodo can stand one attack with Bounder as an ally and if the next site is not an underground site you must discard Balrog.

In seven years of play i dont remember i 've ever faced a Balrog in a tournament.Troll was the first choise for Moria decks.

## 19 [Wallenstein on March 30, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/44476-wish-list/?do=findComment&comment=446209)

I also think that scouting Moria, even without fighting Balrog, would be very interesting. There should be a lot of hiding and fighting way out through swarms of orcs and some cave trolls.
Think that Gandalf had some bad feelings about Moria (our heroes told him something gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]), and Aragorn also made at least one trip through so fit perfectly.

 

In the same climat we could also see adventure sets related to:
- Angmar (previously visiting Bree, Barrow Downs and finishing around Carn Dum),
- Minas Morgul (with Cirith Ungol and Shelob’s Lair),
- Mount Gundabad (as part of travelling around Anduin river).

I think that Saruman (still pose as helper rather than black character) will be used as ally (one use like Gandalf) or “Nazgul from Dol Guldur” – whatever his abilities are.

Maybe quest for searching for lost Palantir’s from Annuminas and Amon Sul – vide ICE’s Palantir’s Quest.

Fighting with superopponents like Balrog, Smaug etc. is tempting but can lead to situations that they will have bigger characterisctics than usual enemies and that’s all.
Compering to Hill Troll how tough should be Balrog?? For me running from Moria will be much more interesting/frightening/exciting that fighting with enemy: attack: 15, defense: 15, hit points 20... sorpresa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sorpresa.gif]
Higher than normal enemies will quckly lead to situation when we need to have cards that add more bonuses, so it ends in the point where in 10th adventure pack we will receive card - Folko (ally): similiar to Gandalf but draw 10 cards, discard 4 enemies, reduce threat by 15. It is sad but EVERY card game ends with something familiar – cards from later expansions are much more powerfull than from core/base set. It is sign that developers have no more ideas how to expand game other than increasing numbers.

I HOPE WE WILL NOT SEE THIS IN MELCG. happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]

Would it be possible to launch one of those big expansions with The Hobbit complete story campaing, and they could start releasing adventure packs based on other stories of middle-earth

Wallenstein said:

This is true.Saruman's real strategy at that time was to find the One Ring and keep it for himself but he acts as an ally and he still is the leader of the White Council.

## 22 [ClydeCloggie on March 30, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/44476-wish-list/?do=findComment&comment=446252)

The notable absence from this game for now is...Rings. With the arrival of Bilbo and Gollum we will hopefully also see that magic ring of theirs appear in the first expansion cycle, and then future cycles will hopefully work towards the moment where it is revealed as the One.

 Re: Balrog

A solution for the Balrog could be, not to make him a creature, but a treachery. Something like: when revealed sacrifice a hero. Would make sense, story-wise, wouldn't it. So better put "Fate or Fortune" into your deck gran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif]

This is a very good idea.

I have one more solution.FFG can sell N/A and buy the rights for Silmarilion from Tolkien's son and then the joy is endlessgran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif].We can have armies of Balrog fighting with elves,Beren and Luthien,Valars and Morgoth........

I saw the second one rarely - Moria usually had plenty of shadow to pay for some big hitter.  You are right though, usually it was the Troll.

I see the very big guns as scenarios in and of themselves, with each Quest card possibly representing a stage of the encounter.

Yes also at site 5 you can play Balrog from your hand or your discard pile with -6 cost.

On the other hand Glamdring,Sting,Frying Pan and Power According was an auto win against Moria.

## 29 [Frog on March 30, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/44476-wish-list/?do=findComment&comment=446431)

I think this license is the same one that Cubicle-7 has for their One Ring RPG.

If so, this game can use any place, item, character, or creature from..

Hobbit & Appendixes

LOTR & Appendixes

The upcoming One Ring RPG is even set during the same time-frame.

I'm 100% sure you will see the Balrog etc.

But anything else you want from The Silmarillion, Unfinished Tales, Children of Hurin, or the 12 volumes of History of Middle Earth are off-limits!

If that's so, then I can see why they'd want to exhaust those before moving onto anything else.

But surely the rights for the Silmarillion are going to be cheaper than those for LOTR? and well worth it if the game proves to be popular in a year or two.

Besides, who doesn't want to have Feanor as your Hero? 4 or 5 for Attack, Defence and Willpower, but with a card text of "every time you use Feanor, deal one point of damage to one of your other heroes"... or something like that, not got it figured out yet, just convinced that a deck full of Noldur would be cool.

Yes, the Tolkiens themselves are notoriously unhappy about all these games and there's no way they will ever sanction a game based on stuff they hold the copyrights for.

Oh, now did not suspected that this topic would become so big.

You know what would be great - a Deluxe expansion for Christmas 2011.

## 36 [pwvogt on March 31, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/44476-wish-list/?do=findComment&comment=447123)

 I bet we'll be seeing a deluxe expansion before then, probably October - November to get the pre-holiday season bump. 

I like taking the discussion in this direction - what would you like to see for Deluxe Expansions?

I've seen someone here suggest a Hobbit quest line as a deluxe expansion which would be, to be quite honest, amazing. You could have a de-powered Gandalf the Grey, Bilbo, and Thorin as your main three Heroes, and the possibilities for ally would be huge. 

I'd also love to see some battle-specific questlines. I know it's probably outside of the time line, but as an example, a deluxe expansion walking the players through the different phases of the Battle of Helm's Deep would be amazing and fun to basically try to hold out until morning when reinforcements come through.

## 37 [sisyphus5 on March 31, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/44476-wish-list/?do=findComment&comment=447126)

 Yeah, the Hobbit would be neat.  Part of me thinks they'd want to tie such a release into the movie's release, but I'm not sure how far ahead they have the game planned.  Sooner would be better in my book.

## 38 [Narsil0420 on March 31, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/44476-wish-list/?do=findComment&comment=447180)

I'm thinking we'll really want a big batch of player cards, whatever the theme is. It seems like we really don't get a lot in the adventure packs. I'm thinking maybe they'll do an expansion based around a specific culture like Rohan, Gondor, Elf, or Dwarf since the Adventure Packs are geographically oriented.

I had the same thought: The first cycle of Adventure Packs centers on Mirkwood, and if this hints a the concept of the game, we can expect more regions be dealt with future adventure pack cycles.

I expect the first deluxe expansion at the end of Mirkwood cycle, which would be around October?

I think the "Hobbit" theme will be too resourceful: They won't be using it up on a single (deluxe) expansion I'm afraid. Rather I expect either a culture themed expansion or maybe a bigger questline, featuring one big "monster" quest (e.g. mines of moria).

Oh I see, so who owns the rights for LOTR / THe Hobbit, if not the Tolkiens?

 

As far as a big expansion goes, I hope they'll keep a decent balance in the cards - The AGOT deluxe expansions have only focused on one house, which makes things a bit skewed until the equivalent comes out for another house. I hope we don't see for example just a "Lore" expansion, or a "tactics" one. Something for each sphere is they way to go.

Warner Bros has the rights and if a company wants to make a game or a movie they must take the licensce from WB.

As for the expansions i hope that too.In most games as time goes ideas are poorer and the only think they add is bigger numbers and more broken cards and the game loses interest.

I would be suprised if that was true, unless they were using movie stills.

Usually the rights are per product - toys, movies, books, etc.  WB for sure owns the rights to publish the movie (and they can sell those right, they have been sold before), but I sincerely doubt they own any other rights.  I.e. they don't have the book publishing rights, nor the right to produce Hobbit toys.  Unless - again - they are using movie scenes/stills then WB would have to sign off on it, on top of the Tolkien estate. 

(Just a little background, I was a banker for a few gaming companies until last year)

Doesn't FFG own some gaming Hobbitt rights already?  For board games?

Me and my horrible English....sad.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sad.gif].

WB has the rights for the movies and for games based on the movies.WB owns the rights for The Hobbit the movie and can make a game for The Hobbit.Games Workshop expanded the licence from WB and they can use Hobbit for their miniature game.

FFG on the other hand can use the licence from the books and thats the reason why they cant have Aragorn,Gandalf,Gimli,Legolas etc look like the characters in the movies.

## 44 [Toqtamish on April 1, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/44476-wish-list/?do=findComment&comment=447462)

And WB only owns them because they bought out New Line Cinema who owned the movie rights since they are the ones that made the movies.

 

Anyway, getting this topic back on topic.

I agree we will likely see a large box expansion after the first cycle, that is exactly what happened with Warhammer Invasion. After the corruption cycle Assault on Ulthuan came out.

Lcg's tend to have different versions of the heroes or heroes are allways the same?I mean at later expansions we may have a different Aragorn with different abilities and stats or the first Aragorn is the only Aaragorn we will get?

Desipher's card game had many versions of every character and minion.Does this huppens at Lcg's?

I'd love to explore some of the areas of conflict that The Lord of the Rings hints at, but doesn't get to directly. Things like issues up at Dale and the Iron Mountain, the events in the south that send the people (along with Bill Ferny) migrating through Bree, border skirmishes down towards Umbar...that sort of thing.

Consensus among those with eyesight good enough to decipher the blurry pictures gives us the following six titles.

The Hunt for Gollum
Conflict at the Carrock
A Journey to Rhosgobel
The Hills of Emyn Muil
The Dead Marshes
Return to Mirkwood

There will be more made up characters I am sure. And as for more heroes we will have 6 more once the current adventure packs are all out. If that continues we will in a year have at least 12 new characters, more if a big box expansion gets put out in the first year.

If we will have only 12 heroes in one year there is no need for made up characters.I can name you 12 original characters without even think twice.

Galadriel,Arwen,Celeborn,Elrod,Eomer,Theoden,Boromir,Faramir,Bilbo(we know we will have him allready),Haldir,Cirdan,Treebeard,Hama,Gamling and maybe later Frodo,Sam,Merry,Pippin.

FFG can use so many heroes from books and not some random made up characters but i am almost sure that we will see some random rangers,Gondorians etc.If ffg wants to use their made up characters a better idea will be to use them as allys and not as heroes.

## 65 [Toqtamish on April 6, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/44476-wish-list/?do=findComment&comment=450058)

Its already too late for that. They already have used their own characters. And its their game so I am not going to tell them what to do. I am all for new characters. There is only so many big name characters or versions of them that I can stand.

 

We all know you are big Tolkien fan Servant, many of us are, myself included although I lean more to the Silmarillion. But you still have to realize they need some flexibility in heroes they release instead of dropping big names every pack.

I imagine Galadriel, Elrond, Cirdan, Treebeard and Arwen more as allies. Especially Arwen since the creators want nothing to do with the film where she had a much more bigger part than in the book.

Also, someone on the french forum saw on a site presenting the first expansions the card of Haldir of Lorien : he's an ally in Lore sphere 4 2/2/2 3 Ranged Sentinel. Beautiful art from Magali Villeneuve who also made Legolas and Eleanor.

So I don't know who will be the other heroes but here are somme strong guesses : We know that Celeborn and Thorin are planned. We are also missing 2 of the 5 characters from MEQ (Eometh and Argalad). The fellowship members (Boromir and the 4 Hobbits) would be logical. Halbarad, Erestor, Elladan and Elrohir, Faramir, Eomer... That's all I see.

So I agree we will unfortunately have other created Heroes. Or new versions of the previous ones.

I guess it's inevitable that eventually we'll see alternative versions of existing heroes, but I hope it's not too soon. Assuming we won't be able to run the two versions together, lets have  at least a couple of cycles of chapter packs worth of new stuff before we start re-treading over old ground...

## 68 [Toqtamish on April 7, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/44476-wish-list/?do=findComment&comment=450264)

Which is one of the reasons that we will see the made up heroes on FFG's part. To avoid repeats and to avoid every pack having some big name character from the books. If every pack came with one of the Fellowship or something it's less exciting when they are in a pack.

## 69 [servant of the secret fire on April 7, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/44476-wish-list/?do=findComment&comment=450291)

We had the same debate before about made up heroes and i will say again that i have an open mind about made up heroes cause in the world of Tolkien there are many other soldiers/ heroes than the well known and ffg can use some made up characters and name them as they want if that helps the game to be more flexible.

But i will say again that if ffg will give 1 hero every pack there is no reason not give us original characters (or they can add an original character as ally and a made up hero in each pack if that helps tha game) .The reason i am saying this is not only because i am a Tolkien fan and i want the game to be true at Tolkien's lore but by experience from other Lotr games with made up heroes.A lot of people know Lotr story only from the movies and they want to play a Lotr game as Gandalf,Aragorn etc and if they must give their money every month just to see a fake new character and not an original character they will quit from tha game fast(huppend in the past with other games).

PS: one more time i am so sorry for my English.

## 70 [Toqtamish on April 7, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/44476-wish-list/?do=findComment&comment=450320)

Except this game is not based on the movies and they are doing their best to distance from those movies.

Look at Legolas card, sure don't look like Orladon frikkin Bloom to me.

And those big name characters you just named are already in the Core set. They couldn't put everyone in the core set as then some people who only want those big name characters wouldn't bother with the expansions cuz they don't want the new heroes since they are "made up" as you say.

"Made up" characters are here to stay and its not much we can do about it other than accept that as part of the fact of making a game and keeping it marketable and with room to grow. I support FFG in this as in most things they do.

## 71 [servant of the secret fire on April 7, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/44476-wish-list/?do=findComment&comment=450334)

Toqtamish i didnt say to make characters as they are in the movies.I only said that a lot  of people know Lotr story from the movies and they want to play a Lotr game with the original characters(even if they dont look like those in the movies).

From the core set we miss many big names like Boromir,Faramir,Galadriel,Eomer and many more and i think (personal opinion) that it is better to have one of those big names in every new adventure pack than a made up character.Again i dont say that they must remove all those made up characters from their game but i am sure that for the first year a new game can be flexible with only original characters.For example they can have Hama as Rohan hero and not Eleanor and can add Eomer or Theoden in a future pack and the game is still flexible.

Anyway it is not a big deal, just one more reason to kill time as we are waiting for the release datelengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif].

As a Middle Earth Quest fan, I like that they put Eleanor, Thalin, and Berevor in the game. After having played that game for a year and a half, I have a fondness for those characters, my wife always wants to play as Eleanor and sometimes I call her Eleanor as a nickname. happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif] Who knows, after some time, all of you may grow fond of the "made up" characters as well.

One of the heroes I was most pleased with is Dunhere. I really like taking names that have only one or two mentions in the book and creating more of a character for them, that's really clever. It's going to be a big game universe, there's room for all sorts.

## 73 [gerateur on April 7, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/44476-wish-list/?do=findComment&comment=450508)

I would like FFG to put only characters from the books (except for the 5 from MEQ which are already in the game).

There is a LOT of characters that can be used :

Anborn

Angbor

Balin

Beregond

Bifur

Bofur

Boromir

Fredegar Bolger

Butterbur

Celeborn

Cirdan

Dain

Damrod

Deorwine

Dernhelm

Derufin

Dervorin

Dori

Duilin

Duinhir

Dwalin

Elfhelm

Elladan

Elrohir

Elrond

Eomer

Eomund

Erestor

Erkenbrand

Faramir

Fastred

Forlong

Galdor

Gamling

Ghan buri ghan

Gildor Inglorion

Gleowine

Grimbold

Guthlaf

Halbarad

Haldir

Hama

Harding

Herefara

Herubrand

Hirgon

Hirluin

Horn

Hurin the Tall

Imrahil

Ioreth

Iorlas

Lindir

Mablung

Nori

Oin

Ori

Orophin

Rumil

Thranduil

So that makes 60 names without searching too hard and there are probably more to be found.

I really think and hope that FFG will not create new characters.

I don't see why so many people have trouble with stuff being added to Tolkien's world. If it wasn't for Chris Tolkien being such an ass I am sure we would have a lot more stuff set in Middle Earth than we do. There is thousands of years available to expand on it. ICE did this very well. But Chris won't allow it so Middle Earth is essentially stagnant as it is. It will never change or grow. Seems like such a waste to me. I remember reading Isildur a few years ago and thought it was great. And it was written by a fan.

The answer is simple.You cant add other things you have in your mind in a piece of art,you just can't.Maybe for some people Tolkien's writes are just a story or a fairytale but its not ,its not Hurry Potter or just a random story from forgoten realms.You cant take Mona Liza and draw a mountain on the paint because you want to add somethink, you just can't.If you dont like Tolkien's world as it is then dont make a game based on it and make your own game and add whatever you want.

As for C.Tolkien i am on his side 100%.He gave Lotr rights and what we saw is Witch King brokes Gandlaf's staff in a movie, Boromir as ringbearer in a card game and 10.000 wizards in a video game.Sorry but this is not Tolkien's world but a parody and i don't want  somethink like this to huppen to Silmarilion.

I know that many people will say ,what that guy says it is just a story why take a story so serious? But for Tolkien was a work of life and i dont think that he ever wanted to see his work like a Matrix trilogy.

Games are for fun sure but you cant destroy a story like Lotr just to make a game.

ps:its a subject that we can't agree cause we see things from different angles.Fact is that companies can buy the rights and do whatever they want but customers have the right to accept or reject each company's ideas.If ffg's game will be a failure or a big succes only future will tell.

Servant, I respect your view a lot because this body of work means a lot to me, as well. So I'm not trying to change your mind here, because you're right, people approach this from different angles. But to me there's one big reason why it's ok, and maybe it even would have been ok to John Ronald Reuel himself, to expand the world of Middle Earth: Tolkien's goal was a mythology. I can guarantee that there wasn't one dude back in ancient Greece who sat down and came up with the entire pantheon of gods and all there stories all at once, and nobody ever was allowed to change anything. It's not the way of oral histories. And I think Tolkien himself would have recognized it.

 

So sure, various re-tellings have gotten details wrong, such as Sam climbing back down the stairs of Cirith Ungol (my personal biggest pet peeve from the movies) but the simple fact is that people have adopted his world as a mythology. I hope he would have embraced things like people adding on to his work. Chris is in the difficult position of wanting to preserve his father's legacy but at the same time keeping it in the public's eye.

In the end I think you've compared it to the wrong kind of art. It's not the Mona Lisa, or any other painting where it's just what it is. It's a song, where different pacing, rhythms, beats, or whatever else you want to change when you cover a song means that a different person can express what it means to them. I can tell you're a huge Gandalf fan from your other posts. But the character that I love the most is Sam, because of his loyalty. The makers of this game probably have their own favorites. In the end, though, they love the source material enough to try their own version of it and see if we love their version.

In the end, you can choose to just have a party of heroes that existed in the original, and that's fine if that's how you want to play. But I can't see why you'd be upset that somebody is basically saying "I love this work so much that it inspires me to create something new." Because that's art, too.

And let's not forget this is going to be a card game. It's per definition not the exact same story as Tolkien told it. But you do get the chance to relive the spirit of it through adventures and scenarios that connect with the universe Tolkien created. It's supposed to be an experience in itself, meant to be shared with other players, just as reading Tolkiens work is an experience.

Your experience and view on the world of Tolkien will be different of mine. Blame it on our different imagination happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif] No-one has read the exact same story, eve though the letters and phrases in the book are the same. The fact that some many people connect with his work, can relate to it and enjoy their adventure through Middle Earth is, in my opinion, the real genious of Tolkien.

If the new LCG manages to achieve this, it will always be a success, regardless of FFG adding some characters that weren't in the book (in fact: who didn't imagine commoners walking by in Minas Tirith or The Shire, although they weren't always described and fleshed out in detail, when reading those passages in the book?)

## 81 [servant of the secret fire on April 8, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/44476-wish-list/?do=findComment&comment=450807)

Scoob your reply like Narsil said was excelent and if my English were decent we could have a nice conversation on this matter but....

I realy dont have a promblem with characters like Eleanor and Maniacske said it very well.Sure many of us we create our own characters or commoners  with our imagination and Maniacske was right that the experience and the view on the world of Tolkien is very different from people to people even if we all read the same lines.

But as i said before and i am saying this one more time and this is only  my personal opinion that adding a commoner or an imaginery character is a lot different from making Gandalf ringbearer or Sam killing the Blarog with his sword.I can't explain this very well but i think you can understand what i want to say.

So many people with a lot of interesting opinions in those forums is a good sign and i am sure that we will have many more conversation like this in the future. My English is the only promblem sad.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sad.gif].

There is an interesting discussion going on in this topic! I think I can understand all the opinions and I also think there is no right or wrong to this, but it is really interesting to hear everyone's opinion on this - and why they feel this way.

I personally played the lotr TCG by decipher and I liked the first block very well (The Fellowship of the Ring + Expansions) and I really thought it to be a very interesting game with having both good and evil in one's deck. The reason I lost interest in the game over time, however, is because Decipher started to (in my opinion) add fictive characters or unknown characters to randomly. It just lost the feel it used to have in the beginning. What I regretted most is that the game was based on the movie and used pictures and names from the movies. This limited the game too much already before it started. They were predestined to run out of material eventually.

And that is why I already love ffgs lotr card game so much: It is not restricted by the movie, but it draws directly from Tolkien's vast universe he creaated. And as Scoopb put it so nicely, I also believe that Middle Earth was supposed to live. Like a song or a tale that is retoled many times over and over again until nobody knows the original story anymore and nobody can tell what was and what wasn't. We can see this also as recurring theme in Tolkien's work, obviously he was a big admirer of folklore and myths. Since he left us his legacy it is our job to stick to the guideline that Tolkien presented to us and should be able to explore and expand it. Now, of course there will always be people that don't quite managed to catch the spirit of the original in their work, but there are also people who manage to do so very well. I do have faith in ffg that if they create new characters, they give enough background and ties to these characters to make them believable and lovable and I would welcome this option. I would be put off by having to play a "Random Gondor Swordsman #5" because only he fits my combo, though. Let's wait and see how it turns out. I am sure that ffg know what they're doing and that they are aware that they tread on quite light water when dealing with material that has such a vast fan community as Lotr. There is a lot of potential for sure...and I realy love ffg for turning purposely away from the movies! lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif]

Well, it is hard to imagine that ffg will go that far, isn't it ;-)

 

> Look at Legolas card, sure don't look like Orladon frikkin Bloom to me.

Speaking of which: It keeps freaking me out, but the Aragorn artwork keeps reminding me of Prof. Snape (Alan Rickman) from the Harry Potter movie...please tell me I' wrong!!preocupado.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/preocupado.gif]

Yes i aggre with you thats why i am still here and i am waitting for this gamelengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif].

As for Lotr TCG yes it was greate at the begining but i think that Desipher went out from ideas.At later expantions they tried to add some characters from the books wich we didnt saw in the movies like Grimbeorn and Tom Bombadil but they used them with the wrong way.And yes you are right Desipher's game was limited before it started.

Me and some friends we still have all the cards from Lotr TCG and we play very often and wen we see cards like 'strange looking man' we can understand that Desipher's only goal was money and not how to make their game better.

No thats the mane goal of all companies.No one makes a game just to please people or because they are so good and they want to give pleasure to humanity.

But some companies take your money and they give you back a nice and a worth play game and you feel that you give your money to somethink good and you don't just throw your money from the window.That does not count for Desipher.They used a big name like Lotr just to take your money and they gave you back a piece of s***t.People at that time realised that they don't even bother to test their game and their new cards and thats why this game is a memory.

It totally looks like Alan Rickman (Snape)!!! Dead on!

 I'd be all over a Lord of the Rings movie with Alan Rickman as Aragorn.
