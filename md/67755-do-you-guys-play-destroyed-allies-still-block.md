Had a "conversation" with one of my gaming partners about how blocking works in this game…. He reckons that if you block a monster and then the card is destroyed teh block is still counted as defended.. while I think this is incorrect….

Example…

Sleeping Sentry

 * Shadow: Defending player must discard all exhausted characters he controls.

or

 Pathless Country

 * Shadow: Deal 1 damage to each ally in play

There are many other cards that can kill allies and heroes b4 the block happens… anyway, if these shadow effects kill the defender say a 4attack warg,,, then the attack is in fact undefended and the 4 dmg has to go on the hero… as the attack is now undefended.. correct?

Yes you right no defender on resolve attack is undefended.

 Sounds like your friend is a M:tG player.  But yeah, Glaurung is right.

Correct. If your partner doesn't believe it, cite p. 18 of the rules:

If a defending character leaves play or is removed from combat before damage is assigned, the attack is considered undefended.

the determination of defenders and the defense itself are two different phases.
