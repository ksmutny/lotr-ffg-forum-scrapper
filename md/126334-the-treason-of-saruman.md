"The Treason of Saruman introduces thirty-nine new player cards (six new boons and three copies each of eleven different cards) and three renowned heroes, including the Fellowship sphere version of Aragorn."

 

That has to mean a new Legolas and Gimli, right?  Theoden would also fit, though.

Yes, it's Gimli, Legolas and Aragorn, as you can read on the description page of the expansion! =)

This looks like it could be better than I was expecting (and The Road Darkens was a lot better than I had expected).

Man, not 4 heroes again? Why now? Gandalf was neutral and could be built into any colored deck, but now only two heroes? What are they, some kind of spirit-tactics and lore-leadershit hybrids?

## 6 [GrandSpleen on November 4, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126334-the-treason-of-saruman/?do=findComment&comment=1321435)

Cool!  

 

I've got to be misunderstanding the Palantir's effect.  It looks like it says this (I bolded the parts I have to guess at):

 

Exhaust Aragorn and Palantir of Orthanc to discard the top card of the encounter deck.  If Aragorn's willpower is greater than the discarded card's threat, you may add Palantir of Orthanc to the victory display and remove it from the campaign pool to choose a player.  That player reveals one fewer encounter card this phase (to a minimum of 1).

 

 

If that's correct, I don't really understand it: it looks like a boon version of Gildor's Counsel, but you choose a specific player.  In the saga expansion, players each reveal 1 card... so if you choose 1 player to reveal 1 fewer card, but to a minimum of 1--- that would do nothing, unless there are scenarios (like Breaking of the Fellowship), where one player may be revealing several cards per turn.  So you'd end up with a rather weak boon effect that has no effect except is a handful of scenarios.  That can't be right, can it?

lolz. 

 

I can't wait until a game where someone has spent about 8-10 resources loading Gandalf up with attachments, and then gets some "...discard all attachments" encounter card effect. 

 

Shadowfax makes the Galadriel ally a bit better. Being a 3-cost attachment, it maximizes the value of her effect.

> Yes, it's Gimli, Legolas and Aragorn, as you can read on the description page of the expansion! =)

 

Note however that it doesn't say they're hero versions specifically: 

"As with its scenarios, all the heroes and player cards in The Treason of Saruman are inspired directly from the first half of The Two Towers. Among them, we find new versions of each of the Three Hunters"

And hopefully there won't be any complaining about the number of player cards since they very specifically told us how many there were...

 

Man, I really like the sound of the Helms Deep scenario. As far as I understood it, it sounds like the enemy will be putting "progress" or more likely damage on the quest cards and we'll be using our willpower to try and stop them.

Or defense power.  You see that "Defense" keyword on the quest card?  Wondering what that one means!  And how it differs from "Siege," which has "Helm's Deep" written all over it.

## 12 [Pharmboys2013 on November 4, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126334-the-treason-of-saruman/?do=findComment&comment=1321633)

Nice preview article.  Will try to touch upon the points they mentioned:

-While fellowship Aragorn was already spoiled from gen-con i would just in general like to commend the designers in learning from what i would consider "mistakes" from their first hobbit saga expansions.  The Baggins sphere player cards were absolute trash and the resources of the Baggins sphere themselves were too greatly integrated into the mechanics of the quest in my opnion.  I like how so far the fellowship player cards have been strong considerations and the resources are used more for specific hero's ability than as a dependent variable in you passing the quest.

 

-I am once again slightly disappointed by the inclusion of only 2 legitimate heroes in the box since heroes are the driving force of variation in deck types but so be it.  And while the description page confirmed we'll be getting new versions of legolas and gimli yet didnt specifically say they would be the two heroes....get real, absolutely zero doubt they will be the two heroes.  Wouldnt be surprised if we get some significant unique allies like we did in road darkens for Theoden, Eowyn, Eomer, etc.

 

-We only saw one true player card, but I like how the spirit event shown continues the Rohan theme of willingly discarding allies.  I think its also relatively safe to guess that we'll get a few more player cards that will hopefully amplify the rohan trait to the point we would like it to be at since with so few cards remaining to get in the ring maker cycle, we may not see it there.

 

-For the uruk-hai, it seems like a very interesting mechanic.  I originally thought it would be will power heavy but after seeing quest stage 1B for it, i really have no idea how thats going to play out, which is exciting...always impressed by how the designers keep each scenario fresh.  Helm's Deep should be pretty epic,  they didnt fully explain the whole "switching" roles thing the encounter deck will be doing but i got a very seige of cair andros vibe from it.  Finally i think road to isengard is going to be really difficult Saruman will likely be a terrible presence all game, and hand hate will be a very difficult mechanic to combat.

 

Looking forward to it.  Keeping my fingers crossed it keeps the Q1 release window

We saw three player cards, Helm! Helm!, Shadowfax, and The Three Hunters.

## 14 [Pharmboys2013 on November 4, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126334-the-treason-of-saruman/?do=findComment&comment=1321647)

> We saw three player cards, Helm! Helm!, Shadowfax, and The Three Hunters.

I subjectively didn't count shadowfax since we still have no idea what it actually does nor three hunters since I don't see fellowship cards as true player cards because of their inability to drastically influence the player card pool due to the limited scenarios they're allowed to be played in.

## 15 [MyNeighbourTrololo on November 4, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126334-the-treason-of-saruman/?do=findComment&comment=1321651)

Would be funny playing Saruman and Grima player card throughout and after the Treason of Saruman scenarios. 

I mean, if Sarumans personally shows up only at the third quest of the saga box, nothing stops us from using him in the first and second. And there is no mention of Grima, but he'll probably be an enemy of the first quest.

## 16 [GrandSpleen on November 4, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126334-the-treason-of-saruman/?do=findComment&comment=1321656)

Here's a random question: since we know what areas of the books are covered by these three scenarios, what do you think we can expect from GenCon or Fellowship event quests?  Assuming they continue the recent (delicious) trend of adding extra quests into the campaign.

## 17 [faith_star83 on November 4, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126334-the-treason-of-saruman/?do=findComment&comment=1321705)

hmmm...nice spoilers! We already know how Quest Stage 1B of the Uruk-Hai works, more or less at least. Seems again a race against time with the pursuit value getting higher the more enemies pile up in the staging area and the quest points being equal to the pursuit value.

 

I wonder what nasty effects Ugluk will have though, since it seems we won't be able to get rid of him!

From the Road Darkens and now what's been revealed from the Treason of Saruman I really don't see anything missing from the books so I don't think we'll get any more print on demand filler quests for missed content.

Can you think of any Fellowship Event potential quests that would have been missing in these most recent Sagas?

## 19 [richsabre on November 4, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126334-the-treason-of-saruman/?do=findComment&comment=1321733)

fellowship quests...well... the only major parts missing from the 3 quests are merry and pippins adventures into fangorn...

Luckily, they can continue awesome idea of adding extra quests into the campaign quite easily.

Apart from announced quests, there are many nearly equally important events in Middle-Earth, such as:

 



- First and Second Battle of the Fords of Isen

- Battle of Dale and siege of Erebor

- Sieges of Lothlórien

- Assault of Corsairs of Umbar, pillage of southern coast of Gondor

 

I assume that this is is just the tip of the iceberg, beacuse the flames of war have spread throughout Middle-earth.


## 21 [Eldainorn on November 4, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126334-the-treason-of-saruman/?do=findComment&comment=1321743)

Amazing, I am really excited for this expansion, unlike Road Darkens.

 

And finally, new Gimli and Legolas (right, right?), about time. :S Only disappointment is that there will be only 2 heroes instead of 4. I guess we can expect every saga to be like this from now on.

Don't forget that saga quests must involve our heroes directly. PoD quest won't include it's own instance of a Fellowship hero just for that particular quest.

I'm hoping for ally versions of Legolas and Gimli so we can get our hands on a proper and thematic Theoden hero.

I wouldn't bet on it. There is a "Three Hunters" event that targets heroes, after all.

## 25 [Ryodu on November 4, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126334-the-treason-of-saruman/?do=findComment&comment=1322080)

Theoden's arrival as an alternate take on his original hero card will probably occur when they release the battle of Pelennor Fields. I'd say it's at that point in the story that his character has truly grown and changed and that seems like a more thematic opportunity to re-introduce a hero card for him.

 

My 2 cents :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Agree.  The question now is what will their spheres be?

 

I'm guessing Spirit for Legolas and Lore for Gimli.  Those are just hunches though and could be convinced by a rational argument.

 

As an aside it has always bothered me that Gimli's Willpower is higher than Legolas'.  It was Legolas who entered Dunharrow first after all.

## 27 [williamobrien on November 4, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126334-the-treason-of-saruman/?do=findComment&comment=1322380)

I think they'll be Leadership and Lore.  My main reason for this is I am expecting Faramir and Smeagol as the heroes for the next set, and Spirit is the only sphere I can see for Smeagol (*maybe* Lore), leaving Tactics for Faramir.

I would actually think the opposite for the spheres. I see Gimli maybe taking spirit and Legolas being Lore. I may be mixing my movies up with the novels so if I miss the mark I apologize but at least with Legolas he definitely takes on his more "scout" esque nature at this point in the story (seeing the Uruk's in the distance for instance). As for Gimli, he is the only character of the three who is the least suited for such a chase and still manages to keep going which is a big thematic trait to the spirit sphere.

 

I could be wrong... who knows! Either way I'm pumped to see newer versions of some very awesome characters.

It's strange considering the reason they included fatty in the BR was to give each sphere a hero to satisfy all players, but now we only get 2 heroes... My guess is Lore for Legolas and Spirit for Gimli.

Yeah I'm definitely bummed by only getting 2 heroes as this box had potential for so many cool hero choices especially for Rohan but now it looks like we won't even get one Rohan hero :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

This box really should have had 4 and the next one could have had only had 1 or 2 since there's less characters in that half of the book. Oh well I'm sure these 2 heroes will be epic and maybe Legolas and Gimli will actually have some direct synergy! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Here is another spoiler picture via Cardboard of the Rings from Gencon.  We at least know that Gandalf gains ranged and sentinel.

I don't think we'll see the hero version of him until RotK but i hope they make an ally version of him for ToS.

My theory is we won't get a specific Gandalf the White character, we'll get a "Sent Back" boon that allows you to pull a hero from the dead hero list and gives some kind of bonus. Gandalf may have survived some people's run through the Moria. 

## 34 [chuckles on November 4, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126334-the-treason-of-saruman/?do=findComment&comment=1322618)

I'm looking forward to seeing what they will do with new versions of Gimli and Legolas. Though trying not to get too excited in an effort to manage my expectations.

 

Ultimately I would like to run a fun, at least semi competent, three hunters deck (outside of the saga's) and hopefully between the three flavors of Aragorn and two each of Gimili and Legolas this will be possible. 
 
I don't envy the design team; Legolas is currently one of the best heroes in the game and will have serious Haldir competition if he gets a new Lore version. Gimli has aged badly, IMO, would love to see his stats changed and starting threat lowered (Not that I see this happening... so instead hoping for a really useful ability that snergises with at least one of the Aragorn and Legolas incarnations).

## 35 [Gizlivadi on November 4, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126334-the-treason-of-saruman/?do=findComment&comment=1322637)

The problem with that is that thematically the Valar wouldn't just resuscitate Mablung or Fatty Bolger... No, thematically, the only hero that could be sent back is an Istari hero, so I think we'll get a "The White Wizard" boon that we can use to pull a dead Istari hero plus bonus of course. With that said, I could still see a generic hero resuscitation for compatibility reasons.

Gaining ranged and sentinel is an impressive boon(literally), but not worth of cost mark of 3 on an unique card. I wonder what else it does...

Personally, I think that Legolas could fit into either Spirit or Lore, and Gimli could fit into Spirit or maybe Leadership. Considering that the Three Hunters card readies three heroes committed to the quest, I think it's a little more likely that Legolas will be in Spirit, with a bigger focus on willpower instead of attack; it would also allow him and Haldir to coexist in peace. That would leave Gimli to Leadership or Lore. But I can't see him being in Lore... He doesn't spout out too many poems throughout the books, and he's clearly more oriented towards fighting than to reading books. A plausible explanation for him to be in Leadership could be how he "led" a group of dwarves to Helm's Deep after the War of the Ring and started a colony there. He must have had some capability of being a leader. 

Not sure about their stats or effects. Maybe Gimli will get a higher defense instead of attack and Legolas some sort of questing power? 

Anyway, there's my rant. Very excited!

One other small point...  The Aragorn hero doesn't contribute to threat, and the current versions of Legolas & Gimli total 20 threat.  Jus' sayin'...

That's a valid (and pretty darn awesome) fact.

 

One thing which just occured to me because it's running along the top of the site's front page is that I really like the art on the front of the box.

 

Just a random thought which doesn't really matter much.

Pretty sure it is a neutral attachment, not a boon. I'd also be shocked if that was all it did so I'm really looking forward to seeing what else it does.

Also, I would hate to see a Spirit Legolas. Spirit already has too many heroes with 3 attack. It is supposed to be the willpower sphere.

Yeah the art is really epic for Helms Deep.

The Background art on this page on the left is epic as well. Honestly don't think it could get any better, so excited for that quest!! http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_npm_sec.asp?eidm=258&esem=1&epmi=s [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_npm_sec.asp?eidm=258&esem=1&epmi=s]

That's why I said "literally". You know the meaning of a word "boon", don't you?  :lol: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_laugh.png]

 

Speaking of Spirit Legolas, spirit has only two 3 attack heroes, which is not awfully lot. It's not supposed to be ONLY willpower sphere, it's also a progress sphere, threat reduction sphere, encounter cancellation sphere and all that kind of stuff. I can see importance of Legolas becoming the spirit in one little thingy - he has printed Ranged. If they add a good spirit ability - even better.

Unlike TBR and TRD, the Fellowship hero (Aragorn) obviously won't be carrying the One Ring.

 

As it is  the text of the One Ring that allows you to use Fellowship heroes as an "extra" or "fourth" hero, this means that, unless there is rulebook/campaign card text to state that Aragorn does not count against the hero limit, he will count as one of your three.

hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.......

Thats a bit dodgy.... for the first quest it massively offsets the fact two heroes will be captives and more than likely unusable for the majority of or the whole quest so seems pretty awesome but for the second and third quest you simply have to use him but can't use three other heroes? Thats super retarded in my opinion and will require very very specific deck building as you'll have one less hero generating resources that can be used to play player cards (other than fellowship ones)..... He can ready a hero for two resources (every second turn) which is pretty powerful but this in no way offsets the massive drawbacks this would mean. Also he has 0 threat cost... so you would easily be able to use secrecy... but again only have two heroes generating usable/valuable resources..

Just strange... I for one really really hope there are specific rules in the box that allow Aragorn to be a fourth hero or somehow still allow you to use three heroes for the second and third quest.

 

Also if this is the case and you play with more than one player or deck EVERY player would only be able to use two heroes as they would need to be able to receive control of Aragorn when they beome the first player.......

Super super dodgy....

Come on, Aragorn is going to be an "extra" hero. It clearly states the first player gains control, meaning he passes just like Frodo. Of course there's going to be a card or campaign effect that puts him into play and doesn't count towards the 3. Stick it on the "You are playing in Campaign Mode" and problem solved- which I'm sure is the case.

 

No reason to freak out over nothing, there's no way Aragorn isn't going to be "extra" just like Bilbo and Frodo before him. Y'all crazy.

But they don't limit you to playing with just Legolas and Gimli. They wouldn't completely change the rules just so Aragorn would be counted as one of three.

But it was an argument :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

I like to play these extensions with thematic deck, so i will try these scenarios with just Legolas/Gimli/Aragorn.

 

The starting threat is low (secret deck ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] ? ) and the heroes are strong.

And i can play Celebrian stone, sword that was broken and ring of barahir on new Aragorn (if new Legolas or Gimli is leadership).

That's certainly your right to do so... but it will be an optional way of playing that you are self imposing, not a rule :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

(and, based on the new versions of Legolas and Gimli- it could be a ton of fun!)

 

The discussion above was implying that because the text from the One Ring that forces the hero to be passed and doesn't count towards the hero limit wasn't present, Aragorn might somehow count towards your hero limit. I posit that that is silly, and will absolutely not be the case. The hobbit does the same thing!

## 53 [PsychoRocka on November 7, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126334-the-treason-of-saruman/?do=findComment&comment=1325191)

Completely forgot about the Hobbit Saga boxes!!!!!

There is no ring in them but Bilbo doesn't count towards your hero limit, good call.

Anyone else out there who doesn't like the art of the fellowship Aragorn card? I think the leadership and lore art looks very good but that new card... He looks kind of arrogant and skinny...

I wouldn't say it's bad, it's just drawn in another style. Other vision of Aragorn by a different artist.

## 56 [Noccus on November 9, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126334-the-treason-of-saruman/?do=findComment&comment=1327725)

Man that spoiled card Helm! Helm! is good.

Discarding a rohan ally like horse breeder to discard a non-unique foe!

And it's in the spirit sphere, not tactics....so strong.

There are quite a few non-unique enemies out there who ain't no push overs.

This card rocks.

## 57 [MyNeighbourTrololo on November 9, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126334-the-treason-of-saruman/?do=findComment&comment=1327739)

The only thing that bugs me about it is that it costs 2, it requires exhaustion in addition to discardement and it forces you to wait until all enemies attack. Too much "if"s.

## 58 [Noccus on November 9, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126334-the-treason-of-saruman/?do=findComment&comment=1327761)

It would be way OP if not.

That's the biggest if right there.

Horse breeder is the perfect candidate.

She did her horse thing, and now she's useful again with this card.

It's not cheap indeed, but it's in spirit, not tactics.

That's a big difference imo.

Dude. You need to have a Rohan expendable ready, you need to make it through all enemies attacks (that's when usually Rohan expendables leave play) and you need 2 resources afterwards, and the enemy must be non-unique. And don't forget there could be only 3 horsebreeders in your deck. What if you don't happen to draw any? Spirit is not that big on drawing cards. With only 1 cheap spirit rohan to sacrifice, this card is pretty medicore and could be easily rid of one of it's restraints without becoming OP. That's unless they add some more fitting cheap rohans in the Treason of Saruman. We'll see.

## 60 [Noccus on November 9, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126334-the-treason-of-saruman/?do=findComment&comment=1327809)

For now, let's agree to disagree.

I like that Rohan's getting stuff kind of here and there. Not everything needs to come in a neat package. It's already an established trait so it can afford to be gradually steered in different directions

I'll gladly pay 2 resources and hold back a lowly Snowbourn Scout to get rid of one of these guys:

 

mumak-elite.png [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/ffg_content/lotr-lcg/nightmare-decks/uMEN21/mumak-elite.png]

 

Just imagine how many resources and allies you'll have to sacrifice if you don't have something like Helm! Helm! around!

Lol, I was just looking to see if Mumak and Mumak Elite were unique or something. The card validates it's existence helping take care of those two cards, and Rohan has tons of throwaway allies. Definitely powerful.

## 64 [MyNeighbourTrololo on November 9, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126334-the-treason-of-saruman/?do=findComment&comment=1328156)

Yeah. Once in a while you'll get rid of Mumak. All other times you'll sit with a dead card in your hand.

There's enough non-unique enemies who are very powerful and worth the setup it takes to use the card. Whatever, to each his own.

There are number of enemies I would pay 2 resources to remove, especially if i'm using a deck that lacking in the combat department or playing nightmare mode.

 

Some of the other non unique enemies that come to mind:

Boar clan stalker (oh... just noticed that it has a +4 limit... missed this when playing... +7/8 was much more fun!)

Many different types of Trolls

Black Rider's, Rider of Mordor's, Fell Rider's, Ringwraith's

Unspeakable & Primeval things oh and tunneling nameless things

Patrol Leader/Thrashing Tentacle- enemies that have when attacked or when damaged forced effects

Enemies that get a shadow card stating they cant take damage for the rest of the round

Enemies like Morgul Body guard that soak up damage intended for another.

 

Another reason that I like this card is having a sure fire way of sacrificing Edmond :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] 

 

Questions:

1) Are Ungoliant's Spawn and Nazgûl of Dol Guldur unique... they don't appear to be, if not then this card would cheapen these quests some what.

2) Would the discarding bit avoid Crazed Captives forced effect? (Forced: if Crazed Captive is defeated, raise each players threat by 7).

1. They're not unique, so they can be discarded: I guess it cheapens it if you feel it does, but those were both core set enemies, so they couldn't realistically have planned for every scenario future player cards would set up.

2. I asked Caleb since I couldn't find it anywhere in the rule book making clear definitions of the two terms, but destroying and discarding are different. Destroying only occurs when you place enough damage on an enemy to match its health. So discarding Crazes Captive would avoid the threat increase.

Thanks Chris51261.

 

Cheapens probably has the wrong connotation... could make defeating these enemies extremely easy and potentially unsatisfying... alternately if blitzing the quests or being able to use different heroes/ lower combat decks is the goal then awesome... both enemies are a discarded Rohan character away :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I get what you mean. I don't think in future packs or any packs lately it would be an issue though, most boss enemies are unique and some of them are immune to player card effects altogether! You can still get rid of some nasty stuff though, as you mentioned earlier.

Yeah, I've always kinda hated how it seems the only option they have to make an enemy truly difficult to defeat is to make the battle completely one dimentional. "Can you attack for enough to destroy this guy?" No opportunity to be tricky with your events or use your characters abilities, or utilize attatchments. Completely understand why they do it though I suppose.

This box would be something like a finishing touch for the Ring-maker cycle, bringing both ents and rohans to the closure.
