Well, I was just messing with the title, nowhere said this is the First Age version but if someone can call him Spirindel (or whatever silliness).

Anyway, there's one thing a bit confusing in that article. Beside The Light of Valinor they also mention Unexpected Courage as a way to negate the forced effect. At least that's what it seemed they're saying but surely it's not true right? Even when you immediately ready Glorfindel you still had exhausted him thus you raise your threat? So they probably just mention it as another way to do two things with him but in this case he still has to pay the price?

the prieview card read to me that you pay the effect AS you commit… regardless if you use UC or not.

so i have no idea what they are talking about as UC has no synergy with this card.

No sure not. You commit character to the quest and exhaust him as well. Light of valinor prevent exhaust but characters is commit anyway.

So threat is not going up.

Another thing about Him is: Before the most good solo deck was 3 sphere deck but now with new Glorifindel you can combine spirit with only 1 sphere and Leadership cards like Sneak Attack and Steward of Gondor can be pass. You can really now build up strong (Rule tnem all) solo deck: Spirit/lore.

The article says Spirit Glorfindel is great at questing and at attacking, (since he has 3 for each of those) and that certain cards, like the light and the courage don't force you to choose between the two. You can do both.

It does not say the courage allows you to ignore the forced effect.

Yes even with courage you take the +1 menace, it's just to be used and abused (questing + strike at 3f in spirit !)

Yes. I got confused seeing the two card next to each other. All clear now. Thanks for the response.
