Sorry if this has been talked about but if a card deals damage (goblin sniper for instance) does it bypass your defense rating?

Â Yes, it does. (Technically it doesn't "bypass" it since defense strength never comes into play in that circumstance, but that's semantics.)

A character's defense strength only matters when he or she is defending. Cards like Goblin Sniper, The Necromancer's Reach, and Dol Guldur Orcs just deal straight-up damage to characters.
