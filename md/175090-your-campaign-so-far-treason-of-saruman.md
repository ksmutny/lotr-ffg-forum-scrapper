I won with 7 progress tokens on stage 4B, such a nail biter of a quest!

My saga deck is solo with Pippen, Sam, and Lore Aragorn. I prefer Mr. Underhill to Gildor boon. I put Noble hero on Sam because my goal was to turn Sam into a total beast. With that boon he quests for 4 and can equip both Sting and Anduil. All the quests, including the POD quests were pretty easy and I had minimal burdens (ring draws them and eaten alive). Then I had to face the Balrog and my team was not so good. I lost a ton and experimented with all kinds of different decks. I wanted to kill the Balrog and then bring a hero back with fate and fortune, but I could never pull it off. Then (after finding out about beyond all hope) I finally killed the Balrog by having Sam die. I replaced Sam with Eowyn and then replaced the fellowship Aragorn with the new spirit Theoden. Pippen was taken captive and easily recovered by Rohan. Then Sam came back with some serious power :-) and sent Eowyn home. I was able to defeat Helm's Deep but I have not yet been able to destroy Isengard. Spirit Theoden is amazing (especially with his sword!), but I don't like tri-color so I may have to cut Pippen or Theoden. I haven't decided yet. That's where I am so far.

Im so confused, you replaced Fellowship Aragorn with Spirit Theoden? how does that work?

I assume he means he replaced the Aragorn in his original fellowship (which was Lore Aragorn) with Spirit Theoden, so his lineup for the Treason of Saruman would be Theoden (Sp), Eowyn, Pippin (captive) for The Uruk-hai, then Sam, Theoden (Sp), and Pippin or Helm's Deep.

GrandSpleen is correct, sorry. I should have said that when I had to include fellowship Aragorn I replaced Lore Aragorn with Theoden. I also implied but didn't make clear that when the fellowship broke apart my team was Aragorn, Pippen, and Eowyn. I'm sure you figured that out.

I'm pretty sure PsychoRocka's scores are not counting rounds, so you might as well post 'em. I like to keep my scores broken down by round, so there is smidgeon of comparability.

 

My solo campaign is still playing serious catch up. I just played Shadow of the Past, The Old Forest, and Fog on the Barrow Downs for the first time as a campaign. Had a lot of fun with a Hobbit deck mixing the traditional attachments (Hobbit Cloak, Dagger of Westernesse, etc.) with Ents.

 

Shadow of the Past:
110 rounds + 17 threat - 4 VP = 123 points 
Heroes: Sam, Merry, Pippin
Boons: Mr. Underhill
Burdens: The Ring Draws Them
 
The Old Forest:
70 rounds + 34 threat - 3 VP = 101 points
Heroes: Sam, Merry, Pippin
Boons: Mr. Underhill, Old Bogey-Stories
Burdens: The Ring Draws Them
 
Fog on the Barrow-Downs:
100 rounds + 35 threat + 1 dmg - 13 VP = 123 points
Heroes: Sam, Merry, Pippin
Boons: Mr. Underhill, Old Bogey-Stories, Ho! Tom Bombadil!
Burdens: The Ring Draws Them
 
I'll update this post as I catch up with everyone else  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Edited mine after beating Road to Isengard the other day.
I am however going to re do the last few quests (from the last point you can change heroes without incurring a threat penalty) or potentially even the whole saga from the start as I recently changed a hero in one of my decks =\ Halbarad to Sam

Just how much do I want that Noble Hero boon...

 

also yeah I don't count rounds either, nice scores Grandspleen =) we both have a handful we did slightly better in score wise and you obviously crushed Journey in the Dark with help from your well earned 50 victory points!

Decided not to restart the entire campaign to get Noble Hero back and instead started from Helms Deep where you can change heroes without incurring the +1 threat penalty and changed Halbarad to Sam in the combat deck.

My post above is edited to show my new results for the last two quests.

I actually managed to beat Helms Deep first attempt this time and had godlike heroes by halfway through:

Sam had Sting, Dagger of Westernesse and two fast hitches attached and was questing for 4 and attacking for either 3 or 4 twice a turn. Elladan had a dagger of his own as well as wingfoot so was questing and attacking. Haldir had Glamdring, Rivendell Blade, Intimidation and Valiant Warrior attached so was taking out any enemy I please in one shot each turn (usually before it could attack that round giving me many extra feints) and drawing an extra card for the questing deck with each kill. Elrohir had steward and shield as well as arwens boost and forewarning so could defend against anything and between forewarned and Haldir sniping foes before they attack I was able to minimize shadow cards and effects massively.

A single Warden of Healing working overtime (even using resources to ready him on a few rounds for double healing) was able to constantly heal me to safe levels of damage.

Crushed it without using up Phial of Galadriel this time so even though I am playing on without earning Noble Hero back I at least still have the Phial this time!

Sam really proved his worth in that single game alone taking out more foes than Elladan! Pretty stoked with my results.

I then went on to re do Road to Isengard and beat that second attempt and was able to avoid Voice of Saruman this time and earn only the Palantir. Back up to date and although I have wasted Noble Hero I still have my Phial this time and also avoided Voice of Saruman as well.

> entMoot - those are some long games!

The 110 rounds should be read as points coming from rounds. Since scoring is 10 points per round, my games were 7-11 rounds. I would expect that to be pretty reasonable for these quests, but I could be wrong. I did lose a round because I forgot to travel in one of the games, though.

My wife and I have been playing through the campaign mode in 4 player (2 players each playing two handed). I didnt think to make any notes during the games about scores and such, so below is a brief rundown.

 

We are trying to play with heroes that are at least somewhat thematic for the game, and altering the hero change threat increase rule to only happen if we switch in someone new entirely. Switching between versions of a hero or moving a hero from one deck to another doesnt raise the threat.

 

Deck 1: Boromir (T), Dunhere, Eowyn

Deck 2: Theodred, Aragorn (Le), Haldir

Deck 3: Sam, Merry, Pippin (Lo)

Deck 4: Legolas, Gimli, Glorfindel

 

1. Shadow of the Past

Earned: Mr Underhill, Galdalf's Delay

 

1.1. The Old Forest

Earned: Old Bogey Stories

 

1.2 Fog on the Barrow Downs

Earned: Ho Tom Bombadil

 

2. A Knife in the Dark

 

3. Flight of the Ford

Earned: Weight of the Ring, Eaten Alive

 

4. The Ring Goes South

Earned: Lust for the Ring

 

5. Journey in the Dark

Earned: Pursued by the Enemy, Overcome by Grief

Character Death: Theodred (sacrificed to the Balrog), replaced by Denethor

Boon Used: Ho Tom Bombadil

 

6. Breaking of the Fellowship

Earned: Followed by Night

Captives: Denethor, Dunhere, Gimli, Pippin

 

Hero lists with boons at the end of #6 (thats as far as we've gotten at this point, though we are getting ready to tackle #7)

 

Deck 1: Boromir (T), Dunhere(Captive), Eowyn

Boons: Phial of Galadriel, Glamdring, Tireless Ranger (Boromir)

 

Deck 2: Aragorn (Le), Haldir, Denethor (Captive)

Boons: Leaf Wrapped Lembas, Anduril, Valiant Warrior (Haldir)

 

Deck 3: Sam, Merry, Pippin (Lo) (Captive)

Boons: Old Bogey Stories, Lorien Rope, Sting, Noble Hero (Pippin)

 

Deck 4: Legolas, Gimli (Captive), Glorfindel

Boons:  Mithral Shirt, Three Golden Hairs, Skilled Healer (Gimli)

According to the insert in "The Road Darkens" doing either of these (moving heroes between decks / swapping betwen versions of a hero) does not raise your threat -- so you aren't altering anything.

So. When you are logged in on the Campaign Log main page (with the list of all completed quests), you can click on the scroll next to the quest (the report is generated every time you complete a quest, so you keep the history of what you've done).

I am about to play Breaking of the Fellowship. It was very thematic to sucrifice Gandalf hero in order to kill Baldrog and win the Journey in the Dark on the next turn. 

 

I want to ask something, When I play the Uruk Hai Scenario, there is no free change of heroes right? So if I do not want to give _1 threat, Sam will continue to the chase of the Uruk Hai, am I right?

Yes, the free change doesn't happen until the beginning of Helm's Deep.

Personally, I took the +1 threat just to make sure Sam could go with Frodo.  Plus, I was also hedging my bet based on a hunch (which didn't come true) that the rules for Land Of Shadow would include something like "Cannot use any hero who was used in Treason of Saruman".  Of course, they didn't implement that rule, but I really though they would, so I simply decided to rotate Sam out.

I totally get how that rule would have made sense thematically but it would have been insanely restrictive and damaging to players who do not want to play the campaign as thematically as possible and instead want to enact a "what if" or "power gamer" campaign. 

Also as far as I am aware the purpose of Saga mode is to be able to recreate the events in the actual books in whatever way you want. You can stick to the story as close as you want or you can create your own reimagining of it with a different fellowship and slightly different results/events.

I agree with PsychoRocka. To punish the players because they want to write their own story wouldn't be nice. It is a game after all. IMO they should just give you the option to change heroes for free in all three quests of Treason of Saruman, so that players who want to be stricktly thematic do not have problem. Anyway, i guess Treebeard will defend Helms Deep now on my campaign hahaha

Yesterday while playing the Uruk Hai, happened the following

 

Merry was the captured hero and first turn, first card that appears is Grishnack. He takes Merry as a captive under him, after quest phase he places a damage on Merry. I engaged him but did not manage to kill him, thus next turn after quest phase 2nd damage on Merry and I lost.

 

I had a Warden of Healing played, could he possibly heal Merry? I tried to read all the , actions etc and maybe he could, but I did not play it this way (I though it is not thematickly correct) and lost the game. 

Does anybody know if this could happen?

Nickpes [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/user/205969-nickpes/],I think you can heal Merry because captives are in play,but not under any player control.You may ask Caleb to be sure.

Thank you, thats what I thought but since everytime I am not sure about something, I play it the way that will damage me, I did not heal him.

 

How can I contact Caleb plz ?

We finally completed The Road Darkens scenario with my buddy RegisF this week end.
We had a blast, those scenarios are really thematic wins, kudos to the designers.
 
Journey in the Dark was actually a breeze, true enough, we had power decks against it so maybe that's why it was a breeze.
We put 20 damages on the Balrog during our first attack against it, Halbarad/Glorfindel/Sam+Halfling Determination plus two Rangers of Cardolan, Gandalf (OHAUH) with Aragorn + 3 Unseen Strikes and a Rivendell Bow if I recall correctly. This was just what we needed, because we planned to sacrifice Glorfindel on the Great Bridge (it's not the most cost-efficient hero to sacrifice, but he's the only one of the six heroes that felt expandable to both our decks strategies). Fortunately, that Balrog was only missing 5 damages to die, and it's a near thematic win, as Glorfindel is the Balrog slayer (well maybe not, depends on the source I know).
 
Idraen came back in the second deck. Breaking of the Fellowship was pretty tough, on our first attempt we made the mistake of waiting too long to clear the first quest stage and we had something like 13 Archery to deal with, so basically everybody died. We won on our second attempt but it was a close call, Merry and Pippin killing an Uruk-hai Captain that would otherwise have killed Aragorn. We explored the Sight of Seeing on our last turn so we dropped the Overcome by Grief burden, which is really cool. We had to use the two Galadriel gifts we chose (Three Golden Hairs and Leaf-wrapped Lembas).
 
We chose Pippin and Sam to be taken captives, but honestly, we may go back and choose other heroes, depending on what we're going to do next.
How do everyone cope with the fact that you actually can't change heroes for free at the beginning of The Uruk-hai? That seems unthematic, because during Breaking of the Fellowship scenario, Frodo choose to go with the Halbarad/Idraen/Sam deck. And now we must take Halabarad and Idraen to rescue Sam and Pippin alongside Aragorn and Merry?
 
But who the hell is with Frodo right now??
 
We're thinking of doing it a bit differently from what it's intended to be, with RegisF and his Halbarad/Idraen/Sam following Frodo in the marshes (playing the quest solo) to be joined then by me with a brand new deck when Ithilien is reached.
And of course myself solo-playing The Uruk-hai to rescue Pippin and be joined by RegisF with a brand new deck for the Helm's Deep scenario.
 
What do you think?

I may confess that Blood of Numenor was pretty stunning. Combining with Steward of Gondor, it gave +8 defence to Halbarad.

I love the campaign log tool! Great work!

I often have to interrupt my campaign for several weeks and then I just forget which heroes, boons and burden I was using. so this has been a lifesaver.

but I'm just wandering if there is an option to "undo" the latest (or another quest) last week I was a bit too fast clicking and now I have registered the wrong choice of burden. And I don't find a noption to alter the resolution of a scenario and change the burden that was logged.

> The Uruk-hai - 142
> 
> Gandalf, Treebeard, & Glorfindel
> 
> Earned: Beyond All Hope on Treebeard
> 
> (I got Treebeard killed during this scenario.)

 

I expected to do this myself, but my understanding is that you cannot use "Beyond All Hope" on a Hero killed during that current game, because he's not in the fallen heroes list at that time (this happen when the game ends).

 

From the Black Rider rules:

First: "After the players defeat that scenario, they turn over the campaign card and follow any resolution instructions,[...]"

Then: "If a hero is in a player’s discard pile at the end of the game, that hero’s name is added to the list of Fallen Heroes in the Campaign Log"

 

This might just be a rule limitation, because it still makes sense thematically.

 

******************* EDIT ****************

 

OFFICIAL: I asked Caleb about this, and it turns out you can indeed use Beyond All Hope on a Hero that died during The Uruk-Hai scenario.

Unfortunately, there's no way to cancel a scenario you've registered. This may be my fault as the database I set does not handle very well the "history" of player choices. Don't want to get too technical, but the tool only registers the last choice. Changing that now would mean a 20 or 30 hours of coding as I'd have to rethink everything and I don't feel like doing it right now.

 

You can pm me or send me an email if you want me to change things, directly in the database, I can correct the boons and burdens you chose.

so after a great fix by Banania.

here is my log up to now. Unfortunately Europe has to wait a bit longer before getting Land of Shadows. So it only goes up to Treason of Saruman.

I started out with Aragorn (leadership) but swapped him for Gloin in the treason of Saruman.

Well most quests took more than 1 try. But I never like to spend the "remove from campaign pool"-boons out of fear I may need them more later.

So most likely I'll start the very last quest, whatver it may be, with all this stuff unused.

Basically yes, you have to wait.

 

I'm not sure I understand your question but nothing that the players have recorded is lost, it's just that you can't record new quests right now. So yeah keep those couple of quests on paper for a while.

===========================================================================


 


First time I've played a campaign through all the released saga boxes + the 2 PODs.


I was playing that the first win over a scenario caused me to progress, rather than replaying until I was happy with the result. For most of the scenarios, the first attempt was a win - Journey in the dark, breaking of the fellowship were the two exceptions.


 


Erkenbrand played the main defender, and he was boosted by Tireless ranger giving him a starting +1 defence. This also gave him the ranger trait, allowing forewarned later in the campaign. Eowyn was the main quester, with Noble hero and leader of men making her even better at doing that. Gandalf and his toys were useful, and allowed me access to warden of healing to keep my heroes alive.


 


In some games, I got Heregruim and snowmane on Eowyn (In addition to her permanent boons), so that she quested for 5, earned a resource, readied and attacked for 6 (with optional boosting). Who needs a tactics Eowyn?


 


I initially chose Erkenbrand as a thematic defender, though he's never been a favourite - now I think he's a great card. He saved several games that would have otherwise been lost. I also used The Day's Rising on him, so he could earn resources when his ability wasn't needed - which became more frequent after the addition of Forewarned.  Heir of Mardil went on theodred so he could quest, and still be available for combat.


 


Gandalf is Gandalf - what more needs be said? He had his full set of toys.


 


Theoden and Eomer were also solid. Eomer generally had Firefoot, and with a lot of rohan ally recursion going on with Gamling, had his combat boost most rounds.


 


I've always liked Rohan decks, and with the latest Rohan cards, they seem to be working very well now.
