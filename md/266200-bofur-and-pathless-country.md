Hey, everyone, long time reader, first time poster here.

I have two rules questions:

1) If I use Bofur's action in the action window after quest resolution, but before the end of the phase, will he stay in play even If I quested successfully?

2) With the recent rules controversy on the sequence of exploring locations and quest cards, it seems that Pathless Country (from Road to Rivvendell) could never be explored, because it's forced effect would trigger immediately after placing progress; which happens long before explored locations are discarded.

TIA

1) No, he won't stay in play.  This was discussed on the COTR discord channel and we asked Caleb.  No justification was provided.

2) I'm not gonna attempt to answer this question because I feel like we have received contradictory rulings and we have to take each one on a case-by-case basis.

Okay, one makes sense. Two is just the OCD (shouldn't that be CDO?) in me being facetious. :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]
