# [The juicebox LOTR LCG Tournament of the Week (#1) [November 20-26, 2011] [COMPLETED]](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56491-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-tournament-of-the-week-1-november-20-26-2011-completed/)

## 1 [juicebox on November 20, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56491-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-tournament-of-the-week-1-november-20-26-2011-completed/?do=findComment&comment=557850)

Welcome & Introduction:

Welcome to my first (of what could become a regular thing) LOTR LCG Tournament of the Week. The idea behind this is that for one week (Sunday – Saturday), everyone is invited to participate in playing a particular quest with particular deck building requirements and a particular number of players. You are then invited to record and post your final score, the heroes you used, and any additional narrative that you’d like to add.

Note: this is not a place to post results from the past. The tournament has a one-week lifespan, and only games played and recorded throughout this week are valid. As the week unfolds, I will keep this first post updated with the Top Ten results. (Each participant can occupy a maximum of one Top Ten spot at a time, so you’re welcome to try and best your own result throughout the week).

Will you place in the Top Ten for the week? I hope you’ll participate and find out!

After the end of this week’s tournament, you are welcome to continue to post results to this thread if you continue to play this particular quest under these particular parameters. However, the Top Ten on this first post will not continue to be updated after the week is over, thus preserving (like a time capsule) the results from this week’s tournament. Further, please refrain from using this thread for extensive theorizing and/or conversation that is not directly related to this particular tournament. Nothing against other conversations – it’s just, that’s what other threads are for. Specifically, if you have ideas for a future tournament of the week, feel free to suggest them in the Ideas Thread [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=579104].

And now… on to this week’s Tournament of the Week!

Tournament of the Week #1:

Quest: Journey Down the Anduin
Deck Parameters: 1 Core Set Only – No Adventure Packs
Number of Players: Solo Play – 1 Player/1 Deck

This week’s tournament is inspired by Marlow’s recent desire [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=577637] to absolutely conquer the Anduin. While playing Solo, using only one deck made from one core set, may not be everyone’s cup of tea, defined parameters are what will make each Tournament of the Week a unique and specific challenge. I hope you enjoy it!

Top Ten:

1. wraith428 ~ 84 (Glóin, Beravor, Éowyn)
2. plueschi ~ 93 (Glorfindel, Beravor, Glóin)
3. leptokurt ~ 95 (Eleanor, Glóin, Beravor)
4. Chac ~ 97 (Éowyn, Beravor, Théodred)
5. OnkelZorni ~ 98 (Beravor, Glóin, Éowyn)
5. Bungo_Underhill ~ 98 (Éowyn, Théodred, Beravor)
7. Avalanche ~ 109 (Aragorn, Beravor, Denethor)
7. Mighty Jim ~ 109 (Éowyn, Théodred, Gimli)
9. juicebox ~ 119 (Éowyn, Denethor, Legolas)
10. Scoob ~ 120 (Beravor, Théodred, Éowyn)

 I think I'll just step ahead:

 

Finished with a score of 109.

Win on turn 9 (80)

33 threat (starting threat of 25 + 8 full rounds, nothing special here)

4 VP (Hill Troll)

 

The heroes I used have been: Eowyn, Theodred and Denethor.

 

I think I'll post my deck list, should I stay in the Top 10 'til the end.

 

One question though: Are we allowed to submit multiple scores should we be able to improve ourselves? I only played one game right now, but maybe I am in the mood to try again later.

Just read your post. First of all: congrats for being the first player to fpost his results. Hopefully more will follow.

 

One thing that is of interest for everyone participating:

I checked your result and was a bit irritated that you played 9 rounds but got only 80 points. That's why I reread the FAQ and it indeed says

 

"In addition to all elements currently used to score a
game, players also add an additional 10 points to their
"final group score" for each round of play that is taken
to defeat a scenario. Players tally each round for their
score at the end of the refresh phase."

 

I completely missed the last part and counted each round, even the last one that I completed before the refresh phase. Am I the only one who is that dumb? sad.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sad.gif] Or do I still have to add 10 points for the last round, even when I didn't reach the refresh phase?

Congratulations plueschi! Right now you sit atop this week's Top Ten!

Also... YES! Please feel free to post multiple successes. Theoretically, at the end of the week someone could occupy all ten spots! (Plus, I'm developing a point system to create a living Top Ten Hall of Fame to track multiple successes over the course of the weekly tournaments. I'll post an update about that in the Ideas Thread [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=579104].)

And leptokurt - important catch! It's true - you don't count 10 points for your last round if you did not need to Refresh.

Well, I'm not sure I could be a self-respecting host if I didn't at least try to place in the first week of my own weekly tournament. I mean, at this point, I don't even know if I'll have the opportunity to compete in every single one that I host, depending on the variables for the particular week. So, I have to take my chances while I have them... right?

And here's a result. Don't know if this will hold for a placement in the Top Ten, but it was a fun game that involved a lot of riding the Banks of the Anduine. Hard.

Heroes: Éowyn, Denethor, Legolas

Final Threat: 20

Hero Wounds: 3

Victory Points: 4

Round Marker: 15

Total Score: 169

Based on valuable feedback, I'm redacting this model. My aim in clarifying this here on this thread, instead of just on the Ideas Thread, is to help mitigate confusion. The revised Top Ten standard will read as follows:

Each participant can occupy a maximum of one Top Ten spot at a time, so you’re welcome to try and best your own result throughout the week.

There will still be a living Top Ten Hall of Fame hosted in a separate thread, but participants will not be able to occupy more than one spot on any given Top Ten listing at a time. So, feel free to post multiple successful quests to each weekly tournament, and if you are in the Top Ten already, I will update your score and rank accordingly as you best your own performance. Thanks to plueschi and Avalanche for your valuable feedback on this matter.

I'll have time to give this a go on Wednesday before all the relatives arrive for Thanksgiving...Can anyone point me to a resource that lists the quantities of cards in the core set?

What do you mean?  Do you want to know how many cards were in the core set or which cards were in the core set?  You can know which cards are the core set ones by the little white ring that's at the bottom right of the corner.  The ones from the the adventure packs will have a spider web.  But you can just go to www.lotrlcg.com and where it says "all expansions" select core, then hit search and it will bring up all the cards from the core set.  Hope I answered your question.

Thanks Avalanche for the response, but I was looking to know how many of each card there were...for example, I believe there's only one unexpected courage, yes?

I ask because when I bought a second core set I gave one copy of the cards that came in a "2 of" to one friend so we both had as many "3 of" as possible from 3 total cores...then another friend quit and gave me his core. So I COULD figure out the correct number of each card, but if someone already had done this, that would be quicker, and much appreciated.

lotrlcg.com has all that info it says how many of each card is included it will be on the right side kind looks like this

Son of Arnor 3 0 2 0 2
[Ally]
Dunedain.
Response: After Son of Arnor enters play, choose an enemy card in the staging area or currently engaged with another player. Engage that enemy.

15

Core

x2 - right here is where it says how many copies are in the set.

 

Let me know if that helps at all

Perfect, that's exactly what I was looking for. Thanks again. Should have checked the site out before thinking it didn't have what I needed.

After many failed attempts with a Gloin, Beravor, Denethor deck I decided to change tactics and try a three sphere Gloin, Beravor, Eowyn deck.  With a lot of luck I came out with a pretty good score.

 

Heroes: Gloin, Beravor, Éowyn

Final Threat: 29

Hero Wounds: 2

Victory Points: 7 (Troll and Gladden)

Round Marker: 6 (played but did not finish round 7)

Total Score: 84

 

Early draw of a Celebrian's stone and a Steward of Gondor set up Eowyn as a questing monster with enough resources to get me a Northern Tracker, two Lorien Guides and two The Galadhrim's Greeting over the course of the game.  Additionally round 2 Eowyn was able to put Unexpected Courage on Beravor and get some serious card draw.  Sneak Attack Gandalf on on the Troll during the Combat Phase of turn turn 3 for four damage, sacrificed a Erebor Hammersmith to the Troll (and took some threat) then attacked with Gandalf, Gloin and Northern Tracker for the kill.  The next 3 rounds quested like crazy and never hit an Enemy although I did hit The Eastern Blight which did slow me down a little.  Got a lot of treachery during my travels down the river that had little or no effect (2 Evil Storms when my threat was below 35 thanks to The Galadhrim's Greeting as an example.)  Got to 3B after quest phase of turn 7 and revealed a Dol Gulder Beastmaster and a location.  Sacrificed a Guard of the Citadel to the Beastmaster and still had Gloin and Beravor in reserve plus an Ever Vigilant to ready the Northern Tracker and together they were able to take down the Beastmaster.

 

Journey down the river was a lucky break... not a single Enemy card in 8 cards.  Also lucky drawing both the Celbrian's Stone and Unexpected Courage (both single cards in the deck) in the early draw. 

 

Liked the deck as it had good resources.  Steward of Gondor on Eowyn gave her what she needed to play spirit cards and Gloin could take damage to gain leadership resources.  Beravor had to be careful about were she spent resources as there was no way to boost her income and she needed to be sure to heal Gloin before he became too damaged.

 

Fun challenge... not sure I can better it.

Congrats wraith, apparently your heroes had a serious flatuence problem, as no enemy dared to approach them We will always remember their journey as the 'Winds of Anduin'.  But your result shall be blown away by my last game where I got double as much points as you. Eat this:

I did play another six games - I lost half of them, but the results I got were quite good (for me, at least): 144, 121 and 114.

 

Heroes: still Theodred, Gloin and Thalin

Result: 114

 

In my opening hand I got 2 x Ever Vigilant and the Sneak Attack / Gandalf combo. Very important for me was to see Faramir's sword, too.

 

The setup was kind and ealt me Despair!. I sent everyone questing for the first two or three rounds ANd made some questing progress. I got Necromancer's Pass and Treacherous Fog. I didn't dare to travel to the pass, since I feared to loose Gandalf. In round 4 I engaged the Hill Troll. I sneaked Gandalf in, hurt the troll with four dmage, chose Gandalf as Defender, readied him via Ever Vigilant and then he killed the monster together with Thalin, the Spearman and a Citadel Guard. Yeah Gondor!

I finally visited the Pass during stage 2. The encounters weren't too bad: Necromancer's Reach, Banks of Anduin 2x and Brown Lands. The latter one stalled my questing progress a lot, but OTOH I could defat the Beastmaster while no new enemy appeared (except of those Eastern crows who tried to pick my heroes from time to time, befor the were picked by Thalin's Axe). Of course right before the end of my tracle more enemies tried to pursue my fellowship: Misty Mountain Goblins and Goblin Sniper. So i could only engage the Misty Mountain goblins in stage 3B, the Sniper had to be handled in the next round.

I finished the game in round 9 with a threat of 35 and a damage of 6 minus 7 VP (Hill Troll and Gladden Fields).

 Finally had the chance to try it.  

Heroes: Aragorn, Beravor, Denathor

Final Threat: 42

1 damage on hero

Victory points: 4

Turns 7

Final Score: 109

I got pretty lucky and had forest snare in my opening hand, and got steward of Gondor in like the first or second round.  Its rough not having all my adventure pack cards.  It makes you appreciate them trying to go back and quest without the newer cards!

Oooooooh... interesting!!  That means we've currently got a tie for 2nd place!

Wonder if that will hold?

Also, I had a chance to play a bit tonight, and while I didn't move up in the ranks, I sure did improve my score:

Heroes: Éowyn, Denethor, Legolas

Final Threat: 40

Hero Wounds: 6

Victory Points: 7

Total Score: 119

Heroes: Éowyn, Thalin, Dunhere

Final Threat: 41

Hero Wounds: 2

Victory Points: 13

Thanks for the fun idea, Juicebox! I got this game when it first came out, and had played a handful of times. Enough to see it was fun, but a lot of two handed solo because I felt solo was a bit hard. Friends too far away and all that. So I hadn't had much experience deckbuilding, and then playing those decks, so this was well worth my time.

My eventual winning deck was Beravor, Theodred, Eowyn. Final score was:

Refresh counter at 10 =100 points

Wound total at 3 = 3 points

Final threat at 24 = 24 points

Victory points = 7

Total = 120

For those interested,I started with Aragorn, Theodred, and Eleanor, thinking the threat starting cost and the sphere synergies with Celebrian's stone made for a good deck. Not to mention Aragorn can defend against one hit from the big bad troll. After three failures (one pretty close one) all on the second stage I realized that I was letting most treacheries go through because either my threat level made them ineffective, or it seemed more appealing to not add threat to the staging area. I realized I needed Eowyn to quest better, and needed to drop Eleanor since I wasn't using her ability.

Adding Eowyn meant fewer turns before the troll, unless I swapped Aragorn. So I added Gloin to the lineup as well. In this 4th game I realized that lack of card drawing was also hurting me, and that some of the exhaust a hero spirit cards, as well as Common Cause, I had in there for Eleanor to use if no treacheries came up could be traded for lore cards. I only went the 4th game before swapping in Beravor

In game 5 Beravor helped me so much. I got to see 2 Gandalfs (one Snuck in, so essentially 3), both Galadhrim's Greetings, and Faramir...all of which helped either set up before taking on the troll or burning through stage 2.

Dishonorable mention goes to Eastern Crows, whose Surge ability directly lead to too many enemies on three of my four losses.

Heroes: Eleanor, Glóin, Beravor

Result: 111

 

I tried to play a three sphere deck. In this game I had some great early card draws (thanks Beravor!) that brought Steward of Gondor, Faramir and a Northern Tracker in my hand.I already had Celebrían's Stone, a Northern Tracker and Daughter of the Nimrodel. The latter was key to victory, as she could heal Glóin's damage over and over. Eleanor became Steward, so both leadership and spirit resources flew richly. The deck challenged my group with some less dangerous enemies (Misty Hill Goblin's, Eastern Crows and a Goblin Sniper) and one location (East Bight). It took me some time to get to stage 2B, but thanks to Galadrim's Greeting I hadn't to worry about my threat.

In round 8 I entered the second stage and a result below 100 was still in reach. It took me two rounds to make it to stage 3B, but then my luck left me when I drew another Hill Troll and some Dol Guldur Orcs. This cost me another turn and some additional threat delivered by your friendly neighborhood troll. llorando.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/llorando.gif]

I'm cheering for the person who can beat this with the highest threat (while still trying to get best score possible).  Well done!  Those are usually the most memorable games.

Distracted my two girls with Garfield long enough to get a game in.  I was just trying this quest solo yesterday with a tactics deck with extreme little success, so I figured limiting myself to just the core set wouldn't end to well.  Also, I didn't want to break apart my good 2 player deck.  So that left me with lore and spirit.

 

I chose to go low threat to pray for a gandalf before having the enage the troll.

 

Game 1 went pretty fast.  I got the troll ensnared only to have his twin show up.  I managed to kill both trolls but I was at 48 threat at that point and gave up.

 

Game 2 went more smoothly.

I drew ensnare on turn 2 and sacrificed a took to the troll so I could ensnare him next turn.  That worked out well.  I was just playing the questing game while putting 2-3 wounds on the troll a turn.  I managed to get out a hammersmith and a guide, aswell as getting self preservation onto beravor. 

While questing through the 2nd stage I managed to get 2 more guides out (huge), brought the took back to life and gave eowyn +1 quest.  The last turn on stage 2 saw a chieftain flip and a location.  Stage 3 flipped the treachery card that put 1 wound on everyone.  That killed the took for the second time (poor little took) as well as taking down eowyn, but her job was done.  The 2nd card from stage 3 was an adder (yay me).  All that was left between me and a victory was the chieftain and an adder.  Lucky me I just drew gandalf.  How thematic.  I didn't have enough to bring him out with a dead eowyn, but next turn I would.  I sacrafice the hammersmith and a guide and put 3 wounds on the adder.  Gandalf comes out next turn and killed the adder.  The chieftain kills another guide, but between dunhere/beravor/gandalf the chieftain easily falls.

End score:

45 threat + 9 for eowyn + 12 turns - 14 bonus points = 160

Result: 111

 

I tried to play a three sphere deck. In this game I had some great early card draws (thanks Beravor!) that brought Steward of Gondor, Faramir and a Northern Tracker in my hand.I already had Celebrían's Stone, a Northern Tracker and Daughter of the Nimrodel. The latter was key to victory, as she could heal Glóin's damage over and over. Eleanor became Steward, so both leadership and spirit resources flew richly. The deck challenged my group with some less dangerous enemies (Misty Hill Goblin's, Eastern Crows and a Goblin Sniper) and one location (East Bight). It took me some time to get to stage 2B, but thanks to Galadrim's Greeting I hadn't to worry about my threat.

In round 8 I entered the second stage and a result below 100 was still in reach. It took me two rounds to make it to stage 3B, but then my luck left me when I drew another Hill Troll and some Dol Guldur Orcs. This cost me another turn and some additional threat delivered by your friendly neighborhood troll. llorando.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/llorando.gif]



How did you manage an 11 turn game and end with 111 points?  You kill every victory point card in the deck?

I suppose he lowered his threat somewhat. 11 turns = 100 points. After 11 rounds he has 36 threat, so if he can lower his threat by 21 (3x gandalf, 1x Greetings) he reaches 111 (with 4VP from at least one Hill Troll).

Of course he can have more VP and less threat reduction.

## 31 [Eric W on November 24, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56491-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-tournament-of-the-week-1-november-20-26-2011-completed/?do=findComment&comment=559866)

I can see it, but it seems like a perfect situation.  Specially since this quest deck loves raising your threat.  I just hope everyone knows you have to let the troll attack 1 turn before ensnaring him.

 

But I shouldn't talk, I played it again and won, so I'm 2 for 3, but I got the worst score I've ever seen.

 

I had 28 threat at the end.  1 wound on a character.  and it took me EIGHTEEN turns.  I couldn't quest out of the 2nd stage even with eowyn at 6 willpower and being able to discard my whole hand whenever i needed for more willpower.  The problem was I had 3 of those locations that are worth victory points but have 3 threat.  It took 3 turns for a guide to burn through them and finally a gandalf had to be used to put me over he top.  Its hard getting 16 quest on that 2nd stage when the staging area consistently was having 12-15 threat. 

 

Guess I forgot to put my heros.  Same this game as last.  Dunhere/Eowyn/beravor.

 

28+1+180-17 = 192

I played 10 rounds, not 11. Perhaps I worded it poorly when I said I enetered stage 2B in round 8. I meant that round 8 was the first round in which I quested against 2B. I finished 2B in round 9 and entered 3B, but needed another round to defeat that ugly troll.

 

Result: 90 points + 29 threat - 8 VP (2 trolls) = 111

 

Btw, if I had not drawn the troll, my result would have been 80 points + 24 threat - 4 VP = 100 llorando.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/llorando.gif]

Finally cracked the 100! happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]

 

Deck: Eleanor, Glóin, Beravor

Result: 8 rounds = 70 points + 30 threat + 2 damage - 7 VP = 95 points

 

I'm a bit surprised that this game went so good, because I considered to take a mulligan when I looked at my starting hand first, but fortunatly decided to keep it. It consisted of

 

Faramir, Celebrían's Stone, Grim Resolve, Sneak Attack, Test of Will and Forest Snare

 

I was a bit worried about the lack of allies, but hoped for Beravor to gather some of them. I also had Forest Snare as my backup against a possible early troll attack. I got dealt Enchanted Stream during the setup which is not too bad, but relying on Beravor I didn't like that card at all. Gamebreaker was Gandalf who I drew early enough to defeat the Hill Troll (Sneak Attack + Ever Vigilant) and Steward of Gondor, which I placed on Glóin as I had tons of leadership cards. During stage 2B I took advatntage of Protector of Lorien which allowed me to get through in two rounds. Grim Resolve allowe me to send everyone questing.During stage 2B and 3B i was luck to draw locations mostly plus one Dol Guldur Orc. I didn't even have to fight in stage 3B.

 

Weird facts:

I had two Forest Snares but used one of them.

I didn't have a spirit ally or a spirit attachment at all!

I got dealt only 3 spirit cards in total - 1x Hasty Stroke, 2 x A Test of Will. I played none of them.

 Looks like the tie doesn't hold ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

 

There was a recent thread over at BGG complaining about the dominance of Eowyn and she is prominent in this tournament, too. So I felt interested, how I would fare without her. After looking over the spheres I wanted to use and the heroes that went with it, I realized that my starting threat would be above 30...

I tried anyway and am amazed by the results I got. I played 3 games and while one was lost to a 2nd Hill Troll on turn 2, I won the other two even with a Hill Troll engaging on turn 1, here is the one with the better score:

 

Heroes used: Glorfindel, Beravor, Gloin

 

Win on turn 6 (!) 50pts

45 threat +45pts

4 damage +4pts

7 VP (Hill Troll, Gladden Fields) -7pts

= 92pts Woohoo

 

I recorded a turn by turn play, because I think people will be interested in how it went (I knew I would) and am going to post it after the tournament is over, here are the highlights:

I managed to kill the Troll on turn 2 already

I finished stage 2 and 3 all on turn 6 thanks to Faramir and Grim Resolve

Congrats! Especially for deliberatly not using Eowyn.

I tried a similar approach in one of my first decks, but I focused on tactic heroes (Gimli + Legolas) and cards like Feint to prevent the troll from slaughtering my heroes. Looking at your threat it seems that you sacrificed an ally or two to block the troll. But how did you manage the questing? I mean treachery cards like Evil Storm or shadow effects like those of Eastern Crows can easily kill your mission, and other cards raise the threat of the staging area.

I might give it a try again.

 Well, I got somewhat lucky (I think everybody gets somewhat lucky, when achieving a highscore) as no Evil Storm showed up.

Protector of Lorien was a very neat questing card as Beravor got me a good supply of cards, but it also helped survive the Troll on turn 1. And then Faramir is pretty strong (as we all know), I even planned to use him twice on the final turn with Grim Resolve (awesome card, wouldn't have been possible without it), but then I only had to use him once.

Concerning threat increase: The Hill Troll kicked a Snowbourn Scout (+4), I lost questing once (+3) and Gladden Fields have been active two turns (+2)

 

On the other hand I don't think, that I got overly lucky as I didn't draw a Steward of Gondor, which is probably the single most game changing card and I didn't sneak a single Gandalf, which is probably the most often used and abused combo out there.

plueschi said:

I'm sorry, but I read it and understood that maybe I misunderstood the Hill Troll's ability. Is his ability means that I must increase my threat level to his attack strength  - defense strength of defender  - hit points of defender + damage tokens on defender? E.g if defender is Faramir with 1 damage token, I must increase my threat level for 2 (6 attack - 2 defense - 3 Faramir's hit points + 1damage token)? Because I played like difference between attack strength and defense strength of defender. Maybe it is my knowledge of English.

Yes, every unused point of damage is increasing your threat by 1.

So the "formula" is: Troll ATK - defense value - current (!) Hit points.

Your example with Faramir is correct.

Managed to sneak in a few games and recorded a win against Anduin again after a loooong time (this quest seems incredibly hard to me, although not as hard as the ones I haven't beaten yet - Dol Guldur and Osgiliath - but definitely harder than Carrock).

Heroes: Gloin, Legolas, Eowyn

Final threat: 47

Wounds: 4

Rounds: 13

VPs: 14 (2 Trolls, Marsh Adder, Gladden Fields)

Score: 167

Gameplay: It took me 10 turns to get past stage 1, having to battle my way through both Trolls, the Marsh Adder (set up card), a Beastmaster, Wolf Rider and Wargs (took 4 turns to kill as they didn't get a Shadow effect the first 3 times). When Ufthak went as a shadow card, I knew there were no big enemies left. On stage 2, I quested hard and made it in 3 turns, with Legolas swinging his Blade of Gondolin to deal with two Misty Mountain Goblins. That only left one flock of Crows to deal with, so stage 3 was finished in one go.

Due to the 2 Trolls, it was impossible to keep threat low enough, and quest fast enough, to make it a good score, but at least I've now entered a score for this tournament! It's tempting to see how much better the deck can perform if I include AP cards.

I have first tried the quest with a lore/leadership deck (Glorfindel, Denethor, Theodred) but i lost all the games i played. So i try a spirit/lore/leadership deck (Eowyn, Denethor, Theodred) and have some success with it (score of 155 and 145) but i finally choose to use Beravor in place of Denethor to have the opportunity to draw more cards.

 This was tough

I don't play a lot of solo, and haven't played 1 core set only in ages (normally 2x Core, + every expansion pack help i can get my hand on.

Went for a 3-sphere deck, lost within a few rounds my first two attempts - second hill troll first time, brown lands, taking the threat high enough to be engaged by the Dol Guldur beastmaster AND the Troll the second.

Third attempt, managed it, with a lucky starting hand.

Heroes: Eowyn, Theodred, Gimli.

Got Gimli a little bit damaged with a smallish enemy, Steward of Gondor out second turn on Eowyn, for Northern Tracker and Lorien Guide not that long after, Gave Eowyn Celebrian's stone in round 4. Also managed a Gandalf before the end.

Finished in the 9th round - 80
Final Threat - 35
7 Points of Damage on Heroes

13 Victory Points

Finally I managed to get through this scenarion without an embarassing score though I have to admit that I was very lucky. I had a bombastic initial draw but later my deck didn't give me the cards I needed. On the other hand the encounter deck was very friendly to me spitting almost no enemies out so I was able to concentrate on questing in Stage 2.

Heroes: Beravor, Gloin, Eowyn

7 rounds  60

5 wounds 5

Final Threat 43

VP Hill Troll, 2* GladdenFields -10

 

Makes a final score of 98 points. My best score ever, it took me just dozens of hours to achieve this.

Good show everyone... Good Show!!

Let's call it a wrap!*

It's been an auspicious beginning, and I want to extend a hearty congratulations to each and every one of you who participated in this week's tournament.

I'll be posting the Top Ten Hall of Fame [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=582954] thread soon, so watch for that - and if you've placed, enjoy it!

Well earned, all around.

 

*There was some helpful "end of the day" discussion on page three of the ideas thread about the time clock for these tournaments, and as a result it's been decided to use the FFG time-stamp on the forums themselves to standardize the end of our tournament week. So, when the clock strikes midnight at the end of the week (FFG Time), that's all she wrote. That said, I had not made this clear from the start of this (our very first) week's tournament. So, if anyone was under the impression that they had 2 more hours (and if you make a final post within the two hour mark) this week, I will go back and make one more update in the morning (well, it'll be morning for me... gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]). I hope that's not too confusing. And as you can see from the new thread for Week #2 [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=582949], I've attempted to make this new time standardization matter clear from the get go.

Again, thanks for participating this week. It was loads of fun.

Aragorn has left the building.

## 57 [durkheim062511 on November 30, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56491-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-tournament-of-the-week-1-november-20-26-2011-completed/?do=findComment&comment=562122)

I was determined to complete Journey Along the Anduin challenge with the best overall score despite not making it to the deadline on November 26. I am ecstatic to announce that after a week and a half of play I was able to finish the game with a final score of 76!happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]



Final Threat Level: 21



Threat Cost of Each dead Hero: 0



Damage Tokens on Remaining Heroes: 2



Number of Rounds Played: 6 (equals to 60 points)



Victory Points Earned: 7



Total Score: 76



Heroes: Eowyn, Gloin and Beravor (inspired by wraith428’s team)





 



Highlights of the Game:



Completed To the River (1A) by attaching an early Steward of Gondor on Eowyn and Sneak Attacking Gandalf twice to destroy the Hill Troll in round 4. Beravor's power is brought to light with the standard play: Eowyn and Gloin quest leaving Beravor back either to defend, attack or draw cards. On the Journey to the Anduin you draw a good number of cards with this play.  



Completed the Anduin Passage (2A) by reanimating a discarded Faramir, care of a Stand a Fight, and sending in Lorien Guide, Wandering Took, Guard of the Citadel, Henamarth Riversong and Gleowine, plus all three heroes to take down the Location in 2 rounds with only locations and irrelevant events being flipped over.



Two copies of The Galadrihim’s Greeting plus Gandalf were played at this point to bring down my threat total to 21.    



Completed the Ambush on the Shore (3A) on Round 6 as the only two cards revealed were an irrelevant event and a lone Dol Gudur Orcs, which I quickly dispatched with a basic ally block followed by Gloin and Beravor going in for the finishing blow.



 



It took me multiple teams, builds and luck to get to this point and even if this doesn’t count on the weekly tournament forum I’m pretty satisfied with my score. See you all in Dol Gudur!gran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif]

Wow, that's an amazing result, Viper. babeo.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/babeo.gif]

 

And you did finish stage 3B before the end of round 6, right? In that case you should only add 50 points.

 

Well, I think it's almost safe to say that the combo Éowyn, Beravor and Glóin/Theodred is probably the best for this scenario. They also do an excellent job   against Dol Guldur, where I got a 133 in my last game.

 Solo?  If so, great job and who was taken prisoner?

Thanks leptokurt!happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif] I was amazed at some of the scores and couldn't fathom how someone could finish this challenge with less than 100 points. I thought you needed a god-hand to make something like an 84 happen, but apparently its also a combination of skill, familiarity and a lot of luck on the part of the encounter deck. 

I actually wasn't taking any notes during the game, but my tracker was left at 6 when I finished, so I ended in the middle of round 7 and not 6. Sorry for the mix up.

I've also finished this challenge using Eowyn, Dunhere and Gloin, but with my best score only being 117. Dunhere is pretty awesome in this challenge as well, but Berevor is just too good.

I think you're referring to Escape from Dol Gudur, but this challenge is Journey Along the Anduin, so you don't have to "take anyone prisoner".

I know, I know this forum thread is already old news,  but I couldn't sleep until I have exhausted all ways to beat the top score at least once.lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif]

Actually I was referring to this post, and should have quoted it:
