I play the Lord of the Rings movie sound track while my wife and I play the game.  I think this is mostly to increase my wife's interest in the game (when playing solo, I don't play the music).   

Anybody dresses up an an elf while playing? as Gandalf?  as Gollum?sorpresa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sorpresa.gif]  What's your style?

I also like to play the soundtracks.  In order to get a friend interested I played the movies one day.  Only thing I've done other than that was found a nice dicebag for my tokens (it has elven runes on it in a circle.  I believe it is made by Q-workshop.)

 Steroids. They keep my shuffling strong.

Originally, I spent a lot of time posting on this forum and a little on Boardgamegeek in order to keep my interest level high.  Then, starting with the Core set, I had gotten into the habit of writing an extremely thorough commentary and review for each and every release in this series for both new and veteran gamers, and doing that is something that I still enjoy.  At one point I had created a few player resources, but I ended up abandoning them due to mixed reception.

I used to listen to the Cardboard of the Rings podcast all the time and practically spam their website with comments, but since episode 10 I've actually become a regular co-host lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif] which, since I don't really know anyone locally to regularly play LOTR with, definitely does a great job of providing that great sense of gamer camaraderie that helps keep the game feeling fresh and exciting.  I've also created a picture slideshow screen saver using all of the images of the cards, thanks to the scans from Cardgames DB, and nowadays between podcasts I try to help make the CotR website and new Facebook page a fun and inviting place for fans of the game to leave their thoughts and comments.  In addition to always having some new, upcoming release to talk about, the community aspect of this game is definitely what makes it so interesting to me.

My friend and I play the soundtrack occasionally when playing and it adds some mood to the game.  We also know alot of the lore and background of the characters and locations so we enjoy building decks that reflect the history of the scenario. They may not be the best at winning the scenerio everytime but it's how we enjoy the game.

Another way we add to our game, like Lightdarker, we've got a podcast going (The Fellowship of the Cards) to help the community understand the Middle-Earth history and backgrounds on characters. It's a fun way for us to contribute to our community and help fellow players add to their own experiences.

I avoid playing the soundtracks, that's all (I'm getting fits if I have to hear the Fellowship theme one more time).

 I have a mix that I will sometimes put on when I play solo. It includes the movie soundtracks and a CD by the Tolkien Ensemble.

I'm surprised that nobody mentioned booze yet...

And if you're going to drink beer, drink beer from the Prancing Pony. Butterbur's ale was blessed by Gandalf!

I have found that playing in my underwear has increased my gaming ability tenfold...and when the wife comes downstairs and sees me playing cards in my underwear (by myself) I smack her with my staff and tell her "you shall not pass!"

I definitely listen to some tunes while playing solo though sadly I do not own the soundtracks to the movies. :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

I can't imagine that this is conducive to winning many games. Enjoyable, perhaps. Winning recipe, I have my doubts. Uhhhh, what phase was I in again?gran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif]

This question is the very reason I quit watching the movies while trying to play solo! XD

I agree about not being able to watch the movies because of the distraction factor.

I actually own all of the Complete Soundtrack Recordings so I'm able to listen to the part of the movie that fits exactly with the scenario I'm playing. While hunting for Gollum in the Emyn Muil, for instance, I can listen to the "Elven Rope" and "Lost in the Emyn Muil" tracks. It's pretty sweet
