The Player cards were already spoiled elsewhere but it's nice to see some of the encounter cards.

I heard it's a difficulty rating of 10!

Awesome final quest to finish it. And nice to confirm the cards are all true. Still sad about Spirit Aragorn though being kind of meh.

Anyone else seeing that it's not possible to pre-order it from FFG? An earlier version of the announcement had a link to the FFG store, but that link didn't work, and now it's been taken out and it says to order it from your local store. So, no pre-order bonus this time?

I like how the announcement didn't even try to hype up the hero in the pack, which they usually (not always) do.

Any reason why this can’t be preordered through FFG?

Yup nothing about the end of the game or hiatus.  I found that a little weird and not sure what to think of that.

Agreed, except that I would say I really don't like the art on that card at all.  Very disappointing.

Well, there's also still at least two other releases coming out (the Mines of Moria and Escape from Khazad-Dum custom scenario packs).  Presumably, since some of the world already has Nurn in hand but not these two packs, these packs are releasing after Nurn, despite being announced earlier.  Then, FFG can either announce the end of the game or could continue releasing Custom Scenario packs (maybe even doing two-per-traditional cycle). It's minimal work for them. since it basically just entails recombining existing art and text.  

What I don't understand is why make the custom scenario kits at all, especially at this point in the game's run if it's truly meant to be a finished product?  It feels to me like they're intended to be a new release model for the game, where quests-to-play are bought separately from player cards, a bit like the new Marvel Champions game.  Maybe the idea is to get a few Custom Scenario Kits on the market to fill the hiatus and keep the game on people's radars, then after the hiatus roll out some kind of new player-cards packs (or new organizations of old cards) to be used against these scenario packs.  These scenario packs basically represent the "greatest hits" of the game's original cycles without the need to run down 7 hard-to-find Products per cycle.

The art is existing for the custom packs, but the text is original, at least on the cards I've checked.  Still, just tweaking encounter cards for a kit is a lot less work than commissioning artwork, creating new quest mechanics, and developing and testing new player cards.  FFG *could* do more kits, if the market demand justified it and they could spare someone to do a little work.

But in this case the kits were designed for last year's Gencon and the aborted fellowship event, so they were never *intended* to be the final pre-hiatus products in the first place.

Just to reference what I was saying earlier: I was at GENCON last year and they did not commit to this cycle being the end of the game.  Andrew in his answer to me referenced destiny and Star Wars LCG where they used the word ‘complete’ to indicate you now have the full game available to you and no further expansions were coming.

What's with record store employee Aragorn?

To me, it evokes a friar/monk going down to the abbey cellar to grab another cask of beer.  


I think what makes this piece feel a bit out of place with the rest of the art for Aragorn is that--with very few exceptions--most portrayals of Aragorn seem to have him clean shaven or with a short, neat beard. Even FFG's own art for Aragorn tends to follow-this tread (the other three hero-versions are beardless, for instance).  I'm pretty sure had they used the art from either Thorongil or Desperate Path as the Sp-Aragorn art, it'd have been much better received. 

Makes me wonder if it was repurposed art from another character, like Robert Baratheon for the Thrones LCG or something?

Is that something they do? They tell an artist to draw what they feel to be a representation of Aragorn (or any other character), then print it as someone else. I guess if it's written into the contract with the artist they can do whatever they want. For Christmas they can promote SP Théoden as Santa Claus.

Fun fact: Bardic is the only mortal man who can simply walk into Mordor, and he has a cracking good time doing it!

By the way this pack now looks like it is available for pre-order directly through the site. Also, a pre-order promotion is also available.  I just placed mine. 😃

Discouraging that this pack still isn't even featured in the "Upcoming" section of the website.

Wonder when this is supposed to be released, as the article didn't even mention a quarter ("Land of Sorrow" still isn't available in Canada)?

I went back and found out the average days between when a pack is announced and when it's available for the Vengeance of Mordor cycle. It was 133 days. The Fortress of Nurn was announced on June 29th, putting it's predicted availability at around November 9th.

But anything can happen. I've noticed that it seems to already be available in other countries, so who knows...

That's what I find mind-boggling about FFG/Asmodee's distribution. An officially unreleased product by an American company is available in some countries, but not even on the release schedule for the U.S. and Canada. What a mess their distribution chain must be...

It'd be more discouraging if FFG made any attempt to keep the "Upcoming" section up to date.  The Upcoming section also doesn't have *any* entries for Marvel Champions, despite that being a hot-selling LCG in active production.

I just received an email from FFG (really Asmodee) saying my pre-order of The Fortress of Nurn is about to ship.

Funny, the "is Shipping Soon!" emails keep dropping into my junk/spam box, regardless of how many times that I mark that it isn't junk, so I missed it last Thursday. That is the email that gives you a chance to fix payment or anything else. I got the "In Process" email today, which is the email that means your credit card has been billed. So excited!!!

Usually, for me, its been a 7-10 layover from in process to shipping and then 1-2 days to ship. I would assume they are shooting for a 10/1 release date.

I find it interesting that the same week this final adventure pack ships to pre-orders is also the same week that FFG announces the next product release (Hunt for the Dreadnaught). Someone at FFG is certainly on top of things: that's a good sign!

If anyone has access to The Fortress of Nurn I would be very much interested in the story blurb than you can read after defeating the quest and I would ask anyone reading this and willing to do it, to contact me through PM and share the info. Thanks a lot.

As with The Land of Sorrow, there's no sign of Fortress of Nurn being released anywhere in Canada... someone in the U.S./Canada distribution chain seems to have really messed up with LotR (all other FFG products continue to be released up here at the same time as in the U.S., or at most a few days later).

It's incredibly frustrating.

I was wandering if this quest will finally be a good place to use Dour Handed (especially if you bring some players side quest). It seems it might do some good work against Soldier of Nurn

The first time around was a sound defeat in 3 rounds, but we were able to defeat Thane Ulchor at the second attempt, courtesy of some very well timed player's side quests. They are really amazing against this quest. All things considered a hard, but manageable quest. The narrative part was amazing in my opinion, a truly apt ending to it all.
