Are there any news about this adventure being available on PoD as Massing was?

Thanks!

I've posted this already before but here it is again. Publisher of Polish version of LOTR:LCG announced that The Battle of Lake-town will be available as POD in November 2012. I am sure that English version will also be available at the same time.

I have had the opportunity to attempt this quest 3 times now on 3 separate occasions at my weekly gaming group (a friend in our group went to Gencon). Anyway, it always KILLS us! Though, I still think  Massing is more difficult.
