Does having a song attached to a hero, giving it the blank resource icon qualify it for being of that sphere? I'm particularly referring to for use with the good meal card. Thank you.

Discard Good Meal to lower the cost of the next event you play this round that matches attached hero's sphere by 2.

Yes. A hero's spheres are determined by what resource icons he has (p. 8 of the rules), and a song adds another resource icon to that hero. So he gains an additional sphere.

Thanks. I just wanted to make sure I was reading it right.
