I wanted to get people's opinions on the latest issue of erratas that came out.  Do you agree, disagree, or are you on the fence about the decisions that were made?  I haven't played the game in about 6 months so I am not really in a position to say anything, but for those active players what are your thoughts?

i cant remember what the last errata was….was that the zigil miner an protector of lorien?

if so they killed the miner…thats for sure. protector needed the errata and is still usable…though i used to use it often in my decks

I don't think they killed the minner, it's still a resource enhancement of between 0-2 extra resources. Which is in line with the amount that other non-unique cards can generate.

It now requires you to use it with something that lets you know you'll be getting at least 1 number correct, but then, to get resources out of it reliabily pre-errata was the same. I think they just made it so that the minner is more inline with it's cost.

 

I was happy with the changes.
