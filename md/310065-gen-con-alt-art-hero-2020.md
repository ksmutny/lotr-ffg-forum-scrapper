Hello, 

 

I was hoping that there would be some announcement regarding getting the new custom scenario kit that would have been released at gen con complete with the alt art hero and playmat.  I take it that there has been no announcement regarding this?   Should I just go ahead and get the custom kit when it's back in stock? 

 

Thanks

I don't believe there has been any announcement at this time regarding FFG's plans for the LotR:LCG at Gencon.  So, unfortunately, no one knows if there would have been any Fellowship Events or Gencon Events this year, Covid notwithstanding.
