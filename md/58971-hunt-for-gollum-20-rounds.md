It wasn't pretty and it took forever but I managed to beat HFG in round 20!

I had like 22 cards in my hand at one point and the Encounter deck was down to about 9 cards remaining.

Not really sure why it took so long...the Clue cards were at the bottom of the encounter deck so that was a big part of it....

perhaps- bad shuffling experiences really made me take my time over it. i used to often get 3 clue cards at once, with 3 hunters guarding them, just daft - whats the chances of that happening- stuff. also if had certain cards in play after finishing a game, and didnt shuffle properly, i would get them exact cards back in play all together, so now i shuffle alot before each game, ESPECIALLY after just buying the pack.

That sounds so familiar....

this game was played on LackeyCCG. Other then hitting the shuffle button, i didn't have much other choice. Here were the cards i played:

3 Longbeard Orc Slayer
2 Celebrian's Stone
2 Steward of Gondor
3 Sneak Attack
1 Beorn
3 Northern Tracker
3 Unexpected Courage
3 A Test of Will
3 Dwarven Tomb
3 Hasty Stroke
1 Stand and Fight
3 The Galadhrim's Greeting
2 Daughter of the Nimrodel
3 Gleowine
3 Rivendell Minstrel
2 Forest Snare
2 Protector of Lorien
2 Self Preservation
1 Beorn's Hospitality
3 Gandalf
2 Song of Kings


Heroes:
1 Denethor
1 Bilbo Baggins
1 Eowyn

I actually got this card list from the youtube video that Tragictheblathering did showing how to use lackey. I stacked up attachments on Denethor so that he could pull both Lore and Leadership cards...

other then a few of the attachments (unexpected courage and the leadership songs/attachments) i didn't play too many other cards. I cancelled a few "when revealed" effects and that was pretty much it. I just couldn't get to those clue cards fast enough.

i think it was just one of those things then, i mean the clue cards statistically have to be at the bottom of the deck some games, just luck i suppose

I agree Rich. Just one of those things. Going to give it another go with the same deck and see what happens. I had 22 cards in my hand at one point. Probably would not have been that bad had i drew more enemy's

 Sometimes as I am prepping the encounter deck, I go through and separate copies of cards away from one another because shuffling, especially with card protectors on is not always easy.  Then I continue to shuffle afterwards so that they are hopefully mixed up well.
