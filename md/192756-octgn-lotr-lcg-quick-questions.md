# [OCTGN LotR LCG - Quick questions](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/192756-octgn-lotr-lcg-quick-questions/)

Hi, I've been using OCTGN for all my LotR LCG play for the past couple years (I buy all the packs physically before playing them on OCGTN).  I tend to play LotR LCG in bursts, and notice that OCTGN has changed a bit since the last time I played. 

 

I have some quick questions:

 

1) What is the recommended URL (site, forum, etc.) for downloading new decks as they are made available for OCTGN (6 months or so after physicaly release)?  

 

2) What is the recommended procedure for getting the card art for the new decks?  (Or is card art included already in the .o8c files?)

 

3) How do you remove/hide decks from OCTGN?  (I like to progress through LotR LCG in order of release.  At the same time, I like to test new decks to make sure their art downloaded correctly.  Since I'm still questing back in the Dwarrowdelf cycle, I'd like to be able to omit all post-Dwarrowdelf cards from within the Deck Editor, and then add them back as I progress through the packs). 

 

Thanks!

http://octgngames.com/lotrlcg/ [http://octgngames.com/lotrlcg/]

 

The card art is all in the image packs, which you can easily navigate to via the menu at the top of that page, and they're separated out by cycles and big boxes.

Hi tripecac.

 

1.) The largest collection of OCTGN plugins resides at http://www.octgngames.com [http://www.octgngames.com].  OCTGN now uses myget feeds to continuously update the plugins with the latest card releases/adventure packs.  (I think that's what you mean by "decks"). Find instructions for setting that up at http://octgngames.com/installing-games/ [http://octgngames.com/installing-games/].  As before, card art is censored for 6 months post-release.

 

2.) The o8c's for the packs >6mo old are very high quality and can be downloaded from http://octgngames.com/lotrlcg/image-packs/ [http://octgngames.com/lotrlcg/image-packs/].  For packs <6mo old I scan my own.

 

3.) You can use the filter settings in the OCTGN deck editor to change the expansions included in the card pool.  There are other deck editors with more sophisticated features out there as well.

 

Enjoy!

Hi, thanks for the info!

 

I have been using the filters in the deck editor to exclude packs that were released after the scenario I'm playing.

 

However, each time a new deck comes out, I have to remember to update my [saved] filters to exclude that as well.  Since I have separate filters saved for each combination of spheres that I play, it's a bit of a pain to update the filters to include and exclude packs.

 

What would be a lot easier is to simply "uninstall" whatever packs I don't want visible to the deck editor.  Is there a way to do that?

You should be using Rivendell Councilroom [http://ddddirk.github.io/lotrdb/] for your deck building.  The interface is 1000x better, you can select which packs you want to use, and you can export your deck as an .o8c file.

Thanks for the tip; I'll try managing my decks with that tool instead.

 

That said, I'm still wondering: is there an easy to way uninstall packs from OCTGN?  This could be useful for hiding custom encounter decks, nightmare decks, etc. that I don't intend to go through at this time.

No easy way no. You would have to delete the corresponding folders from the database folder. And they would reappear when the LOTR file for OCTGN updates.

Does that mean the .08c files are only for the card art, and the card list is handled separately, as part of the LotR LCG plugin itself?

Yes. The .08c files only deal with the images. The actual card data for the sets is contained in separate files.

Sorry Guys,

 

I am brand new on octgn.

I cannot figure out how to load encounter deck ?

 

Is there something that needed specificaly ? Like creating it like the player deck ?

 

Must be a really silly question but I am sure you can save me a lot of time.

 

 

EDIT : OK found it ... silly indeed

 

Thank you

Michael
