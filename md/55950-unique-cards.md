I was just listening to the podcast you recommended here [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=552611] and they where talking about Faramir and Celebrian Stone being unique, wich I had no idea they were. In fact I'm looking here and don't know how you can tell:

http://lotrlcg.com/cardFocus.php?Title=Faramir [http://lotrlcg.com/cardFocus.php?Title=Faramir]
http://lotrlcg.com/cardFocus.php?Title=Celebrian%27s%20Stone [http://lotrlcg.com/cardFocus.php?Title=Celebrian%27s%20Stone]

So how do I tell if a card is unique? Are there any others?

Thanks,

Javier

The symbol next to their name identifies them as unique. There are definitely more (Gandalf is unique). You can only have 1 copy of a unique card in play at a time (though you can still have 3 in your deck).

Where does it say that? I totally missed it...

Rulebook, page 8.

"Unique Cards
Some cards in this game represent specific, formally named characters, locations, and items from the Middle-earth setting. These cards are referred to in the game as “unique.” They are marked with a symbol before their card title to indicate their uniqueness.
If any player has a unique card in play, no player can play or put into play another card with the same title. Any attempt to do so will fail to the extent that the card attempting to enter play remains in its current location (hand, deck, discard pile) and does not enter play. This rule applies to all unique hero, ally, attachment, and event cards that might enter play. Note that a unique card is eligible to enter play if another card with the same title is in a player’s discard pile but not currently in play. Multiple copies of the same non-unique card can be in play simultaneously."
