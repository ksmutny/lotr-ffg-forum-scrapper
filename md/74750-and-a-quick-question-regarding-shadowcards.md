I tend to overthink things especial in this game. Does the shadow effect on Hunters from Mordor apply to all players or just the one that is engaged with the enemy with that card? Player 1 had one hero with one clue card and player 2 made an undefendet defence and got shadow wffect: "Deal 1 damage to each hero with a clue card. (3 damage if undefendet) ) So, does this apply to ALL heroes regardles of who controles them or just the ones controled by player 2?

Making sense?

 All heroes that have a clue attached… So all players

 Thanks. Thought so, would have been too good to be true otherwise :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]
