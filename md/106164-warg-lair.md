So i have never toughed this before, but now when i am thinking it, how this thing goes?

I mean that do i have to find Mountain Warg in both of piles and add 2 of them in the staging area, if in discard pile and encounter deck has 1 Mountain Warg or do i have to find it in both piles and then put only 1 Mountain Warg in staging area.

 

This is probably really easy and dumb guestion, but i cant speak/write english very well, so can someone help me  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

Not bad question.

 

If you are interested about no shuffling the encounter deck..., can you get the warg from discard pile only, and keep the order of the encounter deck?

You only add 1 to the staging area.

 

Every time a card instructs you to search the encounter deck you must shuffle it; even if you did find the card you were looking for in the discard pile.

 

I believe it is in the FAQ somewhere.

I probably found it

 

(1.31) Self-referential effects 
If a card refers to its own title in its text it should be 
read as referring only to that copy of the card. A card 
that refers to other copies of itself will use the language 
“any copy of...” or “another copy of...” or “a card with 
the title...”
 not shure what this means but i think its this XD

"search ..... and add it"

not add "them".

That isn´t it.

This part of the FAQ is about (and Im just stating a quick and totally made-up example) if a card called "Mountain Paths" has a text along the lines of "when mountain paths becomes the active location put 1 damage on each ally in play"; meaning that you only count that specific version of Mountain Paths that becomes the active location and not also the ones that remain in the staging area to do 1 damage each.
