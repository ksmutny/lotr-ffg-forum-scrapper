So i played Conflict at the carrock and i had this situation: Wargs was attacking to me and it was dealt by shadow effect, if i could used my hasty stroke would wargs went to a staging area after attack?

From Caleb

> If you cancel a shadow effect on a shadow card dealt to Wargs, then Wargs was still dealt a shadow card with a shadow effect and it's forced effect would not return it to the staging area.
