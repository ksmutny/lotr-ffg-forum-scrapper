When a card effect, like "Unwanted Attention" removes a hero or character from the quest, does that character ready? I'm guessing not, but it is a bit harsh.

Nope, just removes their willpower from your calculations.

 

There are much harsher effects out there than this, so just you be ready! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
