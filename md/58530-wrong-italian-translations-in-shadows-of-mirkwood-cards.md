Hi everybody

I just wanted to report a couple of translation errors/typos in the Italian edition:

Discordia (Infighting  - Shadows of Mirkwood, 58).

Italian text reads: "Azione: Sposta un qualsiasi numero di danni da un eroe a un altro". ("Action: move any number of damage from a hero to another").

While it should read "Azione: Sposta un qualsiasi numero di danno da un nemico a un altro" ("Action: move any number of damage from an enemy to another")

 

I Migliori del Riddermark (The Riddermark's Finest - Shadows of Mirkwood, 77).

Italian text reads: "Azione: Esaurisci I Migliori del Riddermark per paizzare 2 segnalini progresso su un luogo qualsiasi". ("Action: Exhaust The Riddermark's Finest to place 2 progress tokens on any location).

While it should read: "Azione: Esaurisci e scarta I Migliori del Riddermark per paizzare 2 segnalini progresso su un luogo qualsiasi". ("Action: Exhaust and discard The Riddermark's Finest to place 2 progress tokens on any location).

if this is so, then i would recommend contacting FFG directly. i do not think they check these posts

I think you'll have to contact the Italian publisher's customer support for things like that. FFG itself doesn't really have anything to do with localized versions of the game.

aaaah now is right. Infact I didn't understand Discordia!

I hope in the future italian release pack, the italian FFG give us some fixed cards
