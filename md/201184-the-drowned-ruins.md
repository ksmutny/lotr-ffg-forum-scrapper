Traps!  Silvans!  Dunedain!  Sunken Ruins!!  Woohoo!!  It all sounds awesome..It really seems like the devs are pulling out all the stops on each expansion/pack for this next cycle...Boats, sailing, explore-able map with locations, double sided locations.  Lots of really interesting mechanics coming our way.  Can't wait!

Was thinking the same thing. Hopefully that's the case, or maybe it'll be yet another female ffg-created elf. In any case, more ally and hero options for Silvan elves are very welcome. I am really curious about this new hero and how it will fit in the meta.

So this is the Underwater Temple level from Zelda. It's a shame I'm not into the theme of these quests, because the player cards look so good I need to get them anyways. And am I the only one who thinks it's weird they've spoiled basically the entire Dreamchaser cycle before Grey Havens is even available, yet not a peep about The Flame of the West saga expansion? I've been dying to see how they'll handle the Battle of the Pelennor.

I feel like we say that every time. FFG spoils super-early every cycle. I love hearing about all these great cards but I do wish they would wait a little longer and spoil less. 

 

As for the next Saga...honestly I would be happy not hearing anything about the player cards until we get them just so I can be surprised but I'm weird :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I don't know where the exact news came from, but on COTR they discussed how she'd been contracted by Wizards of the Coast to do some MTG work instead. I think it's a time commitment issue, and they probably pay better than FFG.

## 19 [Gizlivadi on February 2, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/201184-the-drowned-ruins/?do=findComment&comment=2028671)

I see. But it still doesn't quite make sense to me. She started doing MTG art since Theros block, and we still got her art during the last 2 years. Is this the new iteration of "is the game dying"?

If drawing for MtG was more lucrative than drawing for LotR, then it makes a lot of sense.

No, because nothing stands in the way of her drawing for both of them, because it's not like she is getting endless requests from both companies and is forced to choose - cards are not released so frequently and are usually arranged between a lot of different artists.

It's not hard to imagine a scenario in which a person was not able to do both.  Magali has said it takes her what, 10 hours of work to paint a card?  And she is given a list of cards to complete within a certain time frame, so she'll be kept busy for some weeks at a time when contracted for an FFG product.

I think that while she might cut back her work for FFG - a girl's got to eat after all -  I have a hunch she feels a bit of attachment to her Noldor portfolio and we will still see her work from time to time.

 

Caleb and Matt alluded to this in the video interview at GenCon as well.

## 30 [PsychoRocka on February 3, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/201184-the-drowned-ruins/?do=findComment&comment=2029748)

That art is so **** good for Elven stuff that isn't by Magali. A little more cartoony than her stuff but still really cool I reckon, especially the ornate door behind the courier!!!!

Awesome new Silvan allies, both very useful, both extremely bouncable. The spirit one can be used consistently with bounce effects to get bonus stats from Celeborn each time and place progress each time it is played. The tactics one similarly can weaken an enemies defense each time it is played. Pretty **** good cards if you ask me... 

 

The only issue with the tactics ally is how much better it seems to be than Mithlond Sea-watcher which makes me sad. It costs a single additional tactics resource and simply ALWAYS has 3 attack and ranged rather than only when the top card of your discard pile is an ally.... 

Yes the Noldor ally has 1 willpower which the Silvan one does not but they both have 2 hp and not only does the Silvan always have 3 attack and ranged but it has a completely additional ability... yes most noldor discard decks will almost always have a way to get an ally on the top of your discard pile, yes Lords of the Eldar only boosts the Noldor ally and yes he has that one point of willpower as well but I honestly feel like they both fill the same niche and even though my decks are focused mainly on Noldor rather than Silvan I am really leaning towards including the Silvan ally rather than the Noldor one....

1 more resource but you get the 3 attack and ranged permanently and not just under special circumstances and also get an additional ability to boot, AND even if you aren't playing Silvan encounter effects might put him back in your hand and you can then get multiple uses out of his secondary ability. I am sure there are decks in which each ally will perform better but I think this new Silvan ally trivialises the Noldor one except for in noldor discard decks... and even then there is still the potential for the silvan ally to be better... maybe I am just underestimating the value of paying 1 less resource hmmmmmmmmm

## 31 [banania on February 3, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/201184-the-drowned-ruins/?do=findComment&comment=2029766)

I actually don't care for Magali art. I would actually prefer more Elven art like thes ones Mithlond See-watcher, Galadriel ally, Lore Glorfindel, etc. More "etheral"/"dreamy" stuff. Less Peterjacksony stuff.

 

Back on topic, am I the only one finding the Marksman of Lorien is waaaaaaay to powerful? The only other non-unique ally with 3 attack is the Knight of Minas Tirith, and this one does not have an ability unless you fullfill the mono-Tactics condition, whereas you may trigger every single time the Marksman's ability.

 

His attack value is even bumped to 4 by Celeborn. You could say the same about the Knight and Leadership Boromir, but obviously you won't be playing Leadership Boromir in a mono-tactics deck, whereas you use Celeborn a lot (most of the time, if not all) when playing Silvan.

 

Considering this ally can cost you only 2 resources using O Lorien, this is getting a 4 attack (then 3) for 2 cost. Which is overpowered. Especially when you compare this card to other 3-cost Tactics allly like... Horseback Archer? (Arguably this one can only be played for 2 with Théoden, but he does not have any ability other than Ranged). At least the Marksman should not have the Ranged keyword!

Marksman of Lorien may be compared with the recently released Fornost Bowman. 3 cost tactics non unique ally with ranged both.

 

The ability of Marksman of Lorien is way too strong. In a deck with Haldir you can one shot almost every ennemy!! -1 def would have been more balanced i think.

 

Another Scout ally, this is cool, even if scout characters came from very differents traits (Rohan Silvan Dale and Noldor).

 

1rst AP  : Leadership Hero

2d AP : Spirit Hero (Hobbit maybe to go with Sam spirit ally and the Hobbit Event spoiled ?)

3d AP : Leadership Scout Hero (maybe Rohan?)

4th AP : Silvan Lore Hero

 

Missing 2 tactics heroes for having 2 Heroes of each sphere for the entire cycle. So i guess we will have 2 tactics heroes in a row !

Aragorn Tactics give -1 def (and not -2 def) to all ennemies engaged with him. I don't think his ability is irrelevant ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

 

Giving -1 def to any ennemy in play (not only engaged with you) until the end of the round is already a powerful effect in my opinion.

Aragorns ability is permanent and affects all enemies engaged, Marksman's ability triggers upon her entering play and lasts only until the end of the turn ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

 

So, yes, -1 def on 1 enemy until the end of the turn as an effect of an 3-costed ally entering play would indeed be too irrelevant to care about. It's not powerful enough effect for an ability of something that enters play and consumes entire round worth of tactics resources by doing so.

Yeah, I was thinking you had a definite point until I was reminded that the Mithlond Sea-Watcher is cheaper, at which point it became more "What? A more expensive ally is stronger than a cheaper one? You don't say!"

Comparing favourably to an old card which is quite clearly underpowered (and has been since release) does not make a new card overpowered.

Haldir and his brothers wear shadowy greys to blend in among the trees, like the cloaks given to the Fellowship.

> I don't have the books here at work, but do Tolkien describe the colour of garbs of Lórien elves at all?

"When Frodo came at last up on to the flet he found Legolas seated with three other Elves.  They were clad in shadowy-grey, and could not be seen among the tree-stems, unless they moved suddenly." [First meeting with Haldir, Orophin, and Rumil.]

 

Another elf "clad in grey" helped construct the rope bridge.

 

Three elf-wardens at Celeborn's palace are described as "...Frodo saw that they were tall and clad in grey mail, and from their shoulders hung long white cloaks."

 

Celeborn and Galadriel were met and "They were clad wholly in white".  They are described as dressed in white on subsequent meetings.

 

When they're given the cloaks of Lorien, the elves describe them as "the garb of our own people".  For the cloaks themselves "It was hard to say of what colour they were: grey with the hue of twilight under the trees they seemed to be, and yet if they were moved, or set in another light, they were green as shadowed leaves, or brown as fallow fields by night, dusk-silver as water under the stars."

 

Of course, none of the described elves may be representative of how the ordinary Galadhrim might dress in peace and safety, within their own city.

Legolas as a representative of Mirkwood was explicitly dressed in green and brown. An easy fix of the card text? Same trait after all.

I, too, wanted it to be based off the books. But swashbucklers battling the Kraken on their way to tropical islands to hunt for treasure chests is unfortunately based off a Disney theme park ride.

Look at that - green and brown.

In any case I think this is the most relevant quote, along with the fact that the point was that they were supposed to be well camouflaged - obviously having art where the elves are actually so well camouflaged we can't see them wouldn't work, but given that's still a concept, and that they're depicted as standing in a green and brown forest, having them wear green and brown makes perfect sense (so I suppose perhaps the next step is to argue that the forest is the wrong colour and should be more grey).

Tolkien does actually go into depth when describing the trees of that forest, too.

> Yes, if you ignore all but two words of the paragraph you almost have a point. Congrats.

I didn't ignore anything, thank you, I merely emphasised the key point, that there exists direct textual support for Lorien elves potentially wearing green and/or brown. In a certain light, the cloaks may appear to be green and/or brown. So is there any reason why we shouldn't think "Maybe the elves in that artwork are standing under just that sort of light" as opposed to "Those elves are wearing the wrong clothes" ?

On top of which, given again that the cloaks are supposed to be good camouflage, and that their colours seem to shift, perhaps the reason they're described repeatedly as grey is because their colours shift that way in twilight and in winter (as the forest itself is more grey at those times). Who's to say they don't look rather different in spring and summer?

Alternatively, if you don't buy the colour-shifting interpretation, who's to say the elves of Lorien don't dress differently in different seasons, again for reasons of camouflage? Or that different elves don't wear different things? To suggest that all Lorien elves only ever wear grey at all times is a pretty big assumption given the very low number of examples we meet in the books.

 

At the end of the day, the artist was asked for an elf, and they drew/painted an elf, based on what they imagined such an elf would look like based on all sorts of inspirations. I doubt colour-scheme was specified because it probably wasn't considered that important. But the point is there are plenty of potential explanations for the colour-scheme being other than what was described in the books without suggesting that the designers simply forgot about the books their game is based on (despite the clear love and respect shown to the theme in the game).

Actually, in the context of the paragraph, it's clear that the grey cloaks can actually, given the right lighting be "green as shadowed leaves" or "brown as fallow fields by night".  Maybe it's my monitor, but to me it looks like the art shows the archer in dull green and brown, and blending fairly well into the background.  While grey would seem most likely from the text, I think the text absolutely allows the art.  If it were a bright, garish green I would agree with the thematic objection.

 

Here's the description of the trees according to Legolas, and it too includes green:

 

"There are no trees like the trees of that land.  For in the autumn their leaves fall not, but turn to gold.  Not till the spring comes and the new green opens do they fall, and then the boughs are laden with yellow flowers; and the floor of the wood is golden, and golden is the roof, and its pillars are of silver, for the bark of the trees is smooth and grey.  So still our songs in Mirkwood say."

 

The company came in winter, so of course the description of the trees have them yellow-leaved at that time.

Fallow fields by night aren't brown. Shadowed leaves aren't green. Water under the stars is very dark. Dusk paints everything in shades of grey. 

 

Next you'll be claiming that balrogs have real, flapping wings.

 

 

Magali's art on silvan characters is fantastic for capturing the effect Tolkien was evoking from the grey cloth.

There's also a chance Tactics will only get 1 hero this cycle and perhaps Spirit will get two. Ignoring saga expansions (which the designers might be treating a a self-contained card pool, and which would require 1 Leadership, 1 Spirit and 2 Tactics heroes in the last two expansions to balance out the spheres), we currently have 12 Leadership, 13 Tactics, 12 Spirit, and 13 Lore heroes. Every deluxe + cycle since Heirs of Númenor has given us 2 heroes of each sphere. Shadows of Mirkwood + Khazad-dûm also does this, but Dwarrowdelf created an imbalance in favour of Tactics and Lore. We might get two same-sphere heroes in a row, but the only time that happened before was in Shadows of Mirkwood (Brand and Boromir). So they might be changing the non-Saga hero sphere balance to favour Spirit instead of Tactics (I doubt we'll get three Leadership heroes in the same cycle, but we already have three same-sphere in a deluxe + cycle: Bifur, Aragorn and Elrond). Spirit also has several of the generally acknowledged weaker heroes (Dunhere, Dwalin, Pippin, Fatty), so that shift wouldn't surprise me.

 

For The Drowned Ruins hero, Legolas is also a distinct possibility. We've been waiting for another hero version of Legolas since Core set, and Lore would fit. I think the next deluxe expansion has a good chance of being somewhere around Erebor, and Gimli, Legolas, and Thranduil are all possibilities for sometime near then. Most of the Silvan allies are Lórien themed, and it might be slightly odd to get Thranduil in the same pack as Marksman of Lórien, rather than some Mirkwood themed allies.

> Fallow fields by night aren't brown. Shadowed leaves aren't green. Water under the stars is very dark. Dusk paints everything in shades of grey. 

In my experience, fallow fields by night are still brown, and shadowed green leaves are still green.  Certainly the effect is to darken and dampen the color, but the colors are still.  If motivated by adherence to the text, surely the fact that Tolkien explicitly used the words "brown" and "green" to describe things you say are not that color should have some weight?  The entire point of the passage was to demonstrate how inconstant the color of the cloaks could be, not just think up fancy ways to say "it was gray".

 

Let us rewrite the passage to only include the color grey:

 

"It was hard to say of what colour they were:  grey with the hue of twilight under the trees they seemed to be; and yet if they were moved, or set in another light, they were grey as shadowed leaves, or grey as fallow fields by night, dusk-grey as water under the stars."

 

Doesn't work, and is non-canonical.

 

Eomer also missed the three hunters upon grass, and then in conversation said "Do we walk in legends or on the green earth in the daylight?"  Evidently, green is among the cloak's possibilities, though given the time of year I would again guess it was at best a dull green.

It doesn't work because it's bad writing and it's non-canonical because you wrote it.

 

The point of the passage was to establish the ability of the cloaks to provide camouflage and blend into natural surroundings. Contrast directly with Saruman's cloak of many colours.

I guess the difference is whether you think of the lord of the rings as a living, breathing world where people live, or as a collection of stories with characters and themes.

The thing that I really don't like about some of the designs of the elves and in general are not the colors, but just how obviously they are inspired from the movies. And I get some people atually like that, but it's just not for me at all. Not only from those weird shoulderpads on the jackets of many elves (I think they're supposed to be gambesons of some sort), and every elf needing a diadem with a swirling pattern or just a very John Howe-ish swirling pattern in general, but also the that corset-breastplate on Galadriel, the shield on Westfold Outrider (which looks exactly like a Weta prop [https://www.wetanz.com/assets/Uploads/lotrshieldsrohandlrg.jpg]), the movie-ish design on some of the baddies like the fin-like structures of Orthanc (Saruman's Orders) and Mordor (The Dark Lord's Summons), as well as the aforementioned painfully obvious Peter Jackson eye in the back of the cards. People forget those designs are all Jackson (or rather, John Howe.) Now those designs I think are effective and look good in the movies, but for a game that prides itself from distancing itself from the movies, they are just awkward. Looking at another LOTR card game made before the movies (MECCG), you can see the details on the clothing and design are very different. People in that game seem to wear much lighter clothes that are actually comfortable, like robes and tunics, as opposed to this where everyone wears lots of belts and buckles, which arguably are better for exploring or fighting, but why does Galadriel need a breastplate? Did they even read her description in the books?

Many audio and video interviews with Caleb by Team Covenant and COTR. They explcitly said they gave Legolas dark hair for this reason, as well as mentioned that sometimes they have to ask the artist to "change it up a bit, dress it a little different" becuase it looks to much like the movies, and when asked about the influence of Peter Jackson's movies in general Caleb has said that "the books are the books, the movies are the movies, they're kind of two different things".

I could be wrong here but I think the whole point here is that they are supposed to avoid the movies because of their license, not because of any thematic preference for the books.

 

I imagine it kind of makes sense to allow the art direction to go as far towards the movies (lets face it--the most common vision people have of the IP is Jackson's) as they can get away with without angering The Saul Zaentz Company.

 

And some of the design choices frankly have less to do with being true to either the books or the movies and have much more to do with the artist thinking something looks cool/interesting (I would presume that is where we get the Galadriel outfit--which personally I like).

In general I would disagree that the artwork is inspired by the movies - at least directly. Indirectly, sure, because the artists have almost certainly seen the movies, and they have shaped those artists' mental images of elves, dwarves, and so on - just as the books in their time shaped how people thought of elves and dwarves and so on, which historically had much more diverse depictions than we tend to see today. In this case though it's stronger because there are actual visuals rather than just descriptions which different people could still interpret different ways. They're not intentionally depicting elves as they were in the movies, it's just that because of how prominent the movies were, they're a massive determiner of what elves look like in their heads.

## 68 [Gizlivadi on February 4, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/201184-the-drowned-ruins/?do=findComment&comment=2031743)

I agree completely Pocketwraith. I am not saying that in general the artists are intentionally using the designs from the movies (except at least in the Westfold Outrider). I am aware of how influential the movies are, of how they pretty much shaped the modern depictions of elves and dwarves, and that the artists sometimes slip movie designs subconsciously into their art, but that's precisely the reason there should IMO be more control so as to not resemble the movies in any way. I get the feeling that if the Core Set were to come out say, today, many of the designs (particularly the encounter card back) would be different.

But why? What's wrong with some parts of the game resembling the movies? Especially the art, since while a lot of people (me included) will gripe about changes made to the story in the movies, the visual design has been very widely praised and provokes far fewer arguments (in the LotR movies at least, not so much The Hobbit). A huge number of people would say it's a very good visual representation of the things in the books, so why should another very good portrayal of those things from those books not use certain looks just because the movies did them first?

Because I want the game to look the least like the movies as possible. But as I said, it is just my opinion. It is totally possible for the players and even the art director to want the game to "flirt" with the aesthetic of the movies (as I said, the designs for the most part are effective), but I personally don't want that for the game. I came into this wanting a total artistic deviation from Jackson, as the whole premise of the game is to be based on the novels, not the movies. Yet I admit the influence of the movies is hard to overcome. Sometimes it is frustrating, but I'm not losing sleep over this. As a matter of fact, I like the art on these 2 silvan allies fine. The only real aesthetic problem I have is some exceptions (shield on the Outrider) and the Eye of Sauron. Other than that, the art of the game is still totally serviceable, even Galadriel and her breastplate, though I certainly wish the influence of the movies was less or none.

And the cloaks provide camouflage and blend into natural surroundings... even when the natural surroundings are GREEN.

 

It's a fair point that a silvan elf dressed in green and brown would be a better match for Mirkwood (Legolas is dressed in green and brown), than Lorien (Elves described there are in grey and white).  But the text does explicitly say the grey cloaks can appear green (and brown), and it shows it hiding them from the rohirrim on green grass.  Also, the few elves we see described in Lorien use two differing colors (grey and white) and nowhere does it prohibit them from wearing any colors beside these two.  (Nimrodel actually adds gold to the color mix in Legolas' song, and Appendix A has Galadriel clothing Aragorn in silver and white, with a cloak of elven grey and a bright gem.  At the wedding the fair folk of Lorien again have grey cloaks and white gems in their hair, but their clothes are not described.)

 

In the card in question, I think the green and brown appear muted enough and similar enough to the background to (I think) pass a basic plausibility test, though for an elf of Lorien a grey cloak would certainly be the best choice.  But you know, we've got a lot of Lorien associated cards:

 

Silverlode Archer

Lorien Guide

Daughter of Nimrodel

Haldir of Lorien (ally)

Celeborn

Naith Guide

Rumil

Haldir of Lorien (hero)

Galadhrim Minstrel

Defender of the Naith

Galadhon Archer

Orophin

Galadriel's Handmaiden

Cloak of Lorien

Rossiel

Galadhrim Weaver

Galadhrim Healer

 

Celeborn should be dressed in white and isn't, and while the rest should in reality *most likely* be dressed in "elven grey", I don't think any of them really are, including the card for the actual Cloak of Lorien.  Green and Brown appear frequently, but other colors also appear.  (Galadriel, not listed, is at least depicted in white.)  To the extent that there's a problem here, it neither began with this card nor is this card remarkable in any way as an offender.

 

I don't blame Peter Jackson for how Elves are depicted.  The stereotypical high fantasy elvish "look" was established decades before Jackson's movies, and for better or worse that stereotypical elf was inspired directly by Tolkien.

Fascinating story, thank you.  I goggled the event and found lots of hits, under titles like:

 

"6 bad football excuses"

"Top ten sporting excuses"

"Sir Alex Ferguson's top five excuses"

"The 10 lamest football excuses"

 

I looked at about fifteen different descriptions of the event, not one seemed to think the excuse was credible.  No one, not even Ferguson, said the uniforms appeared green in the right light.  And there were pictures, all of which showed a clear distinction between the grey-clad players and the green pitch.  I'll go out on a limb and suggest that none of the paying spectators had trouble seeing the players.

 

None of the articles had a player quoted on the lack of visibility, only the coach.

 

Over here in American football, there are a number of teams using grey uniforms, none of which have a reputation for invisibility.  To my knowledge, the only college team accused of invisible uniform is Boise State, who use blue home uniforms on blue artificial turf.  Fortunately it's not a perfect match, and only at a distance does the background of the floor matter anyway.  I've only seen one game where at a distance of 10-20 yards the players were partially invisible because of uniform, a 1985 visit to Utah State by BYU in a raging snowstorm, making the white jerseys disappear completely into the snow.  Quarterback Robbie Bosco said after the game he looked for the blue pants, and aimed the ball above them.

 

The canon clearly states that the grey elven cloak could appear green or brown in the right light.  I'm not sure why this is controversial, it's right in the text.

They dominated the league that season, but in 5 games wearing that kit they lost 4 and drew 1.

 

The grey shirts don't need to "look green" to be difficult to pick out against a green backdrop. No one has ever claimed they literally changed colour. Perception by the human eye doesn't work that way. Zerbra stripes are a form of camolflage, but they don't live on fields of black and white snow.

 

Players - like riders moving through a field they assumed was empty - had difficulty quickly recognising teammates at distance.

They went 15-0-4 at home that season, and 10-6-3 away.  That's still a substantial road discrepancy between with and without the grey kit (road only), but without checking strength of schedule the difference may or may not be significant.

 

I finally found a player account (Lee Sharpe) describing the incident and the effect:

---

It was a roasting hot day at The Dell. We didn't have a great record there anyway, but this game went really badly - we were a goal down pretty quickly, and three behind by half-time. Obviously something had to change.

 

I'm not sure if any of the players mentioned the kit. Personally I felt that we were playing really poorly, and that we couldn't really blame anything or anyone but ourselves. Having said that, it was a bit tricky to see players. It was all right if you had a bit of time to look up and see what was happening, but you didn't see much if you only had time to glance. I think the weather had something to do with it too - the fact that it was so bright made our dull grey harder to make out.

 

Anyway, I don't think anyone had time to complain. The manager just stormed in and said: "Get that kit off, you're getting changed." Those were the first words he said at half-time. I don't think he liked the shirt anyway - our results had been poor whenever we wore it, and we certainly never played in it again.

 

It seems a bit strange that we were ready with a totally different kit to change into, but maybe it's because someone thought that the grey kit might be confused with Southampton's - although given that they wear red and white stripes it doesn't seem very likely. We wore blue and white in the second half, and played a bit better. I'd probably put it down to a mixture of the new kit and the manager's hairdryer treatment at half-time. We didn't let any more in and Ryan Giggs scored towards the end.

---

Note that it's the brightness, not the pitch color, that he attributes to making it difficult to see.  But is the effect comparable to the Riders of Rohan "moving through a field that they assumed was empty"?

 

Not at all, IMO.  Unlike the soccer player having trouble when he takes a quick glance, the Riders had plenty of time to react.  Unlike the players, there were 105 of them to react.  Unlike the players, they were warriors who had recently fought a battle and were on high alert for further orcs.  Ugluk certainly had a high opinion of their skills of observation:

 

"But these Whiteskins have better night-eyes than most Men, from all I've heard, and don't forget their horses!  They can see the night-breeze, or so it's said."

 

Grishnakh would probably share that opinion, given that he was detected by a faint ring and a small glint, at night, lying on the ground, in a wide open space with only one fire, and was hit by an arrow immediately and was quickly ridden down.

Here's where the companions, sitting on the ground in their cloaks and waiting for the Rohirrim to notice them encountered the line of riders:

 

"In pairs they galloped by.  And though every now and then one rose in his stirrups and gazed ahead and to either side, they appeared not to perceive the three strangers sitting silently and watching them.  The host had almost passed when suddenly Aragorn stood up, and called in a loud voice:  'What news from the North, Riders of Rohan?'

 

With astonishing speed and skill they checked their steeds, wheeled, and came charging round..."

 

And Eomer asks:  "And strange too is your raiment.  Have you sprung out of the grass?  How did you escape our sight?  Are you elvish folk?"

 

This clearly is not your garden variety camo.  You say that grey doesn't need to "look green" to be difficult to pick out against green, and I'll grant that may be true.  BUT -- the text of the Fellowship of the Ring clearly establishes that the cloaks, in fact, CAN look green.  Man United's lame/legitimate/superstitious (pick one) excuse about the poor visibility of their grey kit doesn't include the slightest hint that the cause is the grey looking green, but Tolkien explicitly says that the cloaks can look green when they are introduced.

 

I don't get why you would criticize on thematic grounds, yet reject the text.

> Can this argument get any more ridiculous?

Obviously it can!

"The green of shadowed leaves" is not a generic grass green. I'm not ignoring the text at all.

 

Either way there is no way that the image from the card in question is depicting the grey cloaks of the elves of Lorien. It's a generic fantasy elf/Peter Jackson movie elf with the wrong label applied.

This is probably one of the only things I dislike about this community... Spend more time arguing about the things that matter, probably, the least. Is the art beautiful? Yes!! Then let's move on please.

BTW, Ian, loved the grey elf picture. Confused me for a sec, cuz I thought the image was just not loading correctly, but then I got it. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
