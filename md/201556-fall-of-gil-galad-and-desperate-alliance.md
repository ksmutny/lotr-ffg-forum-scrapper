If you Desperate Alliance away one of your heroes who happens to have The Fall of Gil-galad attached, and he is destroyed during that same phase, the threat reduction applies to the player you gave him to, right?

1.  Blame your friend for killing your hero. 

2.  Yes your friend would benefit from the threat reduction because "you/your etc." refer to the player controlling the character. 

3.  Exile said "friend".

lol, well, now that my suicidal Love of Tales deck has been nerfed, I'm exploring other cheesy suicidal deck ideas -- in this case, Treebeard hero's self-sacrificing for 13 threat reduction, ha.

Just get three of your friends together and have them each attach one Fall of Gil-Galad to Treebeard.  Then you get 52 threat reduction :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

That would be awesome.  Even though it's limit 1 per deck, it's not limit 1 per hero or unique.  Interesting...

The only problem is figuring out how to get to 52 threat without threating out ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]
