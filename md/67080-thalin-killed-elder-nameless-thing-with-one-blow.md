During my latest solo play of Foundations of Stone I had a brilliant move  in Stage 4.

ROUND  ”1”

Thalin is committed to the quest and the reviled encounter card is Elder Nameless Thing

Elder Nameless Thing
Type: Enemy
Encounter Set: Foundations of Stone
Threat Threashold: 40
Threat: 4 Attack: X Defense: 4 Hit Points: X
Nameless.
Forced: After Elder Nameless Thing engages a player, attach the top 3 cards of that player's deck to it.
X is the printed cost of all attached cards on this card. If there are no cards attached, X is 4.

Thalin deals 1 damage to it, but since it currently has no cards attached to it X is 4 and it’s not killed. The Elder Nameless Thing can’t engage me since my treat is 25.
Later in the round I exhaust Denethor to peek a top encounter card, it’s Deep Deep Dark(see below) I can’t believe my luck and immediately exhaust Imladris Stargazer and place Erebor Record Keeper at the top of my deck.


ROUND  ”2”

The reviled encounter card is Deep Deep Dark

Deep Deep Dark
Type: Treachery
Encounter Set: Foundations of Stone
Doomed 1. Surge.
When Revealed: Attach 1 card from the top of the first player's deck to each Nameless enemy in play, if able.
Shadow: If attacking enemy is Nameless, the defending player must discard his hand.

The top card from the first players deck is “Erebor Record Keeper” cost  1. It’s attached to Elder Nameless Thing. Now is X 1 and is Elder Nameless Thing it’s killed instantly!

Before I never realized that Thalin could kill Elder Nameless Thing with one blow!!!

It didn't die right away, so maybe Thalin was using a poisoned axe? :-)

 Very cool and very correct. I guess Thalin sliced it's aorta… and then it bleeder to death!

 Awesome move!!! Congrats man :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I haven't tried this scenario yet but maybe you could answer a question regard it? When it engages you you take the top 3 cards from your deck and attach them to it. The x = total cost of these 3 cards. If they all have 0 cost does it have 0 hit point then? Or are 0 cost cards not attached? Also can you remove attached cards from it?

Thanks. :-)

Questions: Yes 0. They are attached. No you can't remove attached cards.

Thanks but no thanks. I prefer to ask my questions in the main forum as this is where most are looking. But thanks for the answer :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
