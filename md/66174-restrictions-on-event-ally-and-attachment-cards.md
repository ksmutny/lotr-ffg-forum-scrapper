Other than as specified on a card, are there any restrictions on laying event, ally and attachment cards on another player?  I checked the FAQ, but couldn't find this.  I would assume there are no restrictions, but I would have thought this topic would have been addressed at least once in the rule book.

Thanks.

 Control and Ownership. page 25.

FFG makes it awfully difficult to find certain rules……

 Great Scott!  I scoured those rules, not sure how I missed that.  Thanks!

 I just have to say that reading "Great Scott!" with that avatar made me crack up.
