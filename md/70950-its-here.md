 Wow, what can I say, other than EPIC!!!

I was going to make a thread but you beat me to it. Everything looks wonderful, the art, the cards, everyhting. Looks like it's going to be an amazing expansion.

Well, to be honest, out of the digital artists in this game, Magali is the one I can stand the most, not to say I really love her work. However, by looking at some of the art (look at the box illustration, Smaug, Old Tommoddy and that treachery, and also some of the Magali pieces), it looks like the game's getting a more "traditional" feel, even if those pieces are indeed digital, or at least lighter and less "dark and gritty" than it was in earlier expansions.

 

Edit: on a second look, the artist for the boxes and some of the cards for these expansions seems to be Chris Rahn (I don't have OHAUH, so I haven't really looked at it), which is awesome because I love his art in Magic.

## 6 [richsabre on September 13, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/70950-its-here/?do=findComment&comment=693089)

true but looking at the cards every one of the player cards spoiled are hers, same with numenor…..now i really like her art as i keep saying, just it seems that all major characters get assigned to her, so a growing proportion of cards that will end up in decks will have the same art

this probably isnt an issue to most, however seeing the reaction to many people's thoughts on the new hobbit card game (not this one) it seems most favour digital….and not trad. digital but ultra realistic digital, which is one hell of a skill, but just doesnt appeal to me (ok arwen certainly did appeal haha)

perhaps i should do a poll on it

 hooray, news!

the box art looks superb and the cards are an intriguing mix so far.  that black arrow card is pretty cool and i like that it further expands the usefulness of "ranged" for single player.  i think that card pretty much makes it money in the bank we are going to get a tactics bard hero.

kinda surprised theres a new bilbo; seems like hes going to b even more crucial to the quests this time around too (i suppose he was very important for the 3rd OHUH quest)

## 8 [Narsil0420 on September 13, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/70950-its-here/?do=findComment&comment=693140)

Everything looks amazing! The Black Arrow! I can't wait to use this in Battle of Laketown and hopeful along with a Bard hero. I can't wait to play all six scenarios in a big campain!

Also a good reminder to us to be patient, they'll give us news when the time's right!

What's interesting is that it seems like this will come after Heirs of Numenor which is not the original report from Gen-Con.

I just noticed that on the FFG homepage, on the rotating headline graphics, there is another version of Smaug pictured that's different than the sleeing Smaug we see in the preview. This Smaug looks a little more angry! and also his attack is X instead of his Threat…

it is very likely we shall see him at least as an ally- he was spoiled very early in the game along with thorin, who we have seen in number 1, so hopefully we shall see him in number 2

Look at the "Black Arrow" card closely. I think it's going to be a limit of 1 per deck.

Looks like we'll have different versions of him here too, since the Smaug in the newsreel is called Smaug the Magnificent.

 I gotta be honest I was hoping for an entire cycle of 6 chapter packs.  BUT I am in no way less excited about this box, it look F*****g amazing.  I love Smaug can't wait to go toe to toe with him.

The new Bilbo looks like a guy I was in school with, so I don't know if I'm going to be able to take this one seriously, but I'm still faint with excitement for it! Six new treasures! Oh, beloved Arkenstone…soon you shall be mine… Looks like we're going to avoid all the Laketown thing then, from the description page's list of stuff we'll be doing this time. I wonder if the rules for stringing all the quests together will make reference to the Battle for Laketown scenario that will hopefully appear as PoD sometime in the coming weeks, so altogether there will be seven Hobbit scenarios to get through…

its a real shame that i dislike the bilbo art for this entire two packs, as its obviously the same portrayal throughout the cards….so its not just one thats screwed

the depiction couldnt be further from how i imagined bilbo…..

on the positive side though, i have a feeling the location art for this box is going to surpass even the first one- quite an achievement in my eyes if it does

Well it certainly doesn't mesh well with Tony Fati's Bilbo in THFG

Me too, I always imagined the bushy curly hair (probably Jackson's fault), and more brown than black. I'm not unhappy with Magali's work though, it's just not what I pictured.

ive looked for quite a while and the best i can come up with that closely represents who i see as bilbo is this [http://th06.deviantart.net/fs70/PRE/i/2012/151/8/9/bilbo_baggins_color_by_troubadour93-d51qtz5.jpg] person's art

probably comes from the fact of reading the hobbit when i was 10, so had something like this in mind, but i guess i young ian holm would probably be close so i think jackson did well there

I hear you on that, and on that topic, I think the guy that they've cast for the film looks the part (martin freeman [or Dr. Watson], see below). Maybe Magali had to dodge the real Bilbo look because FFG doesn't have film content rights.

The one in OHaUH and OtD actually reminds me of one of my professors.

yeah, i guess he's not a bad choice, but im just not feeling it with him

as for the avoiding film-like characters that is indeed what the artists are instructed (i remember one talking about it), however her thorin looks awefully familiar…….

PS- i apologise - im probably putting a negative spin on this thread, ironic given the exitment i put into the title, but i am actually much looking forward to the pack, and im sure the art will be amazing (and hopefully varied) as usual

## 32 [player1761766 on September 14, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/70950-its-here/?do=findComment&comment=693577)

I'm really looking forward to the art on this one, I'm a big fan of Magali's work, and quite enjoy the way more of the cards feature her work. It fits the theme well, I find, in a sort of epic fantasy kinda way. Maybe not seeing her on all of the cards would be the best move, as there are other artists with amazing stuff, but then there is a lot of stuff that is just terrible, specifically from the first Hobbit box. I'd definitely say though that it's not how I imagined Bilbo when I read it, though it isn't a bad picture, so I can live with it!

@John, yeah, that is creepily like how he looks now! Maybe I did, after all… gran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif]

Rich, I know you're not a fan of the films, but I have HUGE hopes for the upcoming Hobbit films.  Martin Freeman is one of the reasons for that… I've enjoyed him in pretty much everything he's done (including the generally-despised "Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy"- a poor film, but still enjoyed him in it…).  Plus the fact that he's bringing along Benedict Cumberbatch (yup, a real name) to play the voice of Smaug got me super excited when they anounced it!  The chemistry and snarkiness between the two as Holmes/Watson should play out brilliantly in the dialogue between Bilbo and Smaug.  Looking forward to Jackson redeeming himself!!  lol

I think we'll have to wait another year for Smaug though.
