Did anyone notice on the BGG page, there is an add that refers to the Black Riders expansion. If you look closely, you can see a new ally/hero partially behind the gamebox. Does anyone know who this is or where we can find the complete picture?

P.S.: It looks like art from Magali Villeneuve so maybe an Elf? (Legolas? :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png])

It can also be Sam, since the character has a backpack

Well I would snap a selfie and send it out, but I don't think that would keep with the artistic and imaginative flow of the genre. The picture I got this from was also a low res add so no help there.

What's wrong with it looking like Sean Austin?  What is it supposed to look like?  I don't think that its so bad.  Now if you like pippin (you said before that he is officially your favorite art) than i dont see how you can not like sam.  I think pippin looks like some wierd rockstar guy from a band.  the way his hair and face look.  sam looks more normal at least

The hair does look like the wigs they had the hobbits wear in the movie.

i dont see it on pippin (thankfully) but everyone for different tastes. as for the annoyance with the art, it comes from the similarities with the film characters, not the actual 'look'. i would much rather get a denethor (lore) type art, which i dont consider particularly good, than get someone who looks like john noble.

 

its a matter of principle....the art and artists in this game are good enough to carve out their own place in middle earth's history, without having to rely on other sources to bump up their popularity.

 

finally, out of all characters, sam is one the most depicted as his film version, rather than somoene orginal... seems many artist find it difficult to break away from that.

 

one could say that gandalf is most depicted as his film version, but this is incorrect- he is most depicted as John Howe depicted him orginally, and the film obviously chose Mckellan and made him up as they did in that light (i believe im right in saying Howe was a design consultant?)....so there is a subtle difference here in taking inspiration from a classic depiction of a character/place (gandalf, ringwraiths etc.), and lifting one straight from the film

PS- i have aquired over the years (or 2 and a half rather) a reputation for hating the films, and i just wanted to point out, given my above post, that that is not the case. i love the films....i think they are terrible adaptions, though im not dwelling on this point to derail the post. I do however think many aspects were done well, and sam is one of them. however my point for saying this is that while he acted sam well, i still do not think that artisits should draw on the actor himself- i mean, i cannot imagine picturing the actors when i read the books, but i must admit i'd be pretty annoyed if i saw the guy off pirates of the caribbean every time i pictured legolas, or Sharpe everytime i imagined boromir.

 

Its rather hard to avoid these problems when the artists depict them as so similar

I just wanted to piggyback on these rich. I would actually love to see a "John Noble" Denethor card, that would be almost as good as an alternate art Boromir featuring Sean Bean smiling, too bad such a photo doesn't exist! (I think CotR podcast brought this up)

 

Yes, Howe and that other guy (just kidding Alan Lee) were credited consultants, and cameo-ed in the prologue (I think) as two of the nine Kings of Men (apparently Ted Nasmith was asked to consult but declined because he was busy. Nevertheless a lot of his art seems to have been hijacked--see this site: http://tednasmith.narod.ru/ [http://tednasmith.narod.ru/] --and, perhaps unsurprisingly, went uncredited)

 

I feel the same about the films (despite my harping about Jackson's 'trilogy' in another thread recently): well done (as films, fun to watch, terrible adaptations).
