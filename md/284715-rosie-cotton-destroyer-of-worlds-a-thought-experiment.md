# [Rosie Cotton, Destroyer of Worlds: a Thought Experiment](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284715-rosie-cotton-destroyer-of-worlds-a-thought-experiment/)

## 1 [Some Sort on October 17, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284715-rosie-cotton-destroyer-of-worlds-a-thought-experiment/?do=findComment&comment=3506838)

Thought experiment: Just how high can you pump Rosie Cotton's attack power?

 

Rules:

1. Assume you are using one deck, which means no more than 3 heroes and no more than 3 copies of each card. The deck can be as large as you'd like, though.

2. No saga or encounter cards may be used, though player encounter cards are fine. Exception: you're free to assume there is one Eastern Crow in staging, one engaged with you, and one engaged with another player just to give you your choice of targets.

3. Assume that you've been playing the quest for arbitrarily long and have set everything up exactly to your liking. This means any number of cards in hand, any number of cards in play, any number of cards in your deck (in any order-- assume you just dropped a Gandalf's Search), any number of resources, any threat level, etc.

4. No using cards whose bonuses are potentially unlimited. This means no Keeping Count, no Lay of Nimrodel or Gondorian Fire, etc.

5. No Grave Cairn, just because.

6. No recurring any cards from your discard pile, because otherwise this becomes a game of "pick your favorite infinite loop". I'll make an exception for 3x Lords of the Eldar, because that's the only way to play it.

 

 

I've got an answer that I think is fairly optimized, but I'll hold off a couple days before posting it in case anyone else wants to give it a shot first.

 

Edit: @sappidus [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/251007-sappidus/] reminds me that Grave Cairn only counts printed attack, so it's back on the table. I mostly just didn't want to turn this into a dwarf-counting exercise.

 

Edit #2: a much simpler way of stating rule #6 is that no card can be played more than 3 times except for Courage Awakened / Noiseless Movement / etc, which can be played four times. (Because otherwise you just infinitely loop your attack buff of choice.)

I did just runthrough of the cardpool, so I could optimize this a bit more, but is your answer above or below 6,000?

I'm well below that. If you're hitting 6,000 without recycling cards then you thought of something I didn't.

How many readying effects are in the game?  Since Rosie with Sword-Thain can exhuast to add her willpower to her own willpower, she can double her willpower with every exhaust.  Only the final exhaust is needed to add her willpower to the attack.  With just Sword-Thain, three copies of Favor of the Lady, three Unexpected Courages and three Fast Hitches she can get her attack to ridiculous portions:

Exhaust to add willpower -- 10

UC, exhaust to add willpower -- 20

UC, exhaust to add willpower -- 40

UC, exhaust to add willpower -- 80

FH, exhaust to add willpower -- 160

FH, exhaust to add willpower -- 320

FH, exhaust to add to attack -- 322

To break 6000 just needs 5 more readies, and that's without bumping her initial willpower past 5 -- there's *lots* of cards that can increase her willpower.

Rosie's effect is once per phase.

Whoops, missed that once per phase bit. My new number is just 216 ?

Edit: +15 more if Grave Cairn is allowed

Rosie nerfed!  What's she supposed to do with only 216 attack?  I suppose with all those fast hitches she can kill a lot of bosses.

What we need is Hobbit-Friend, so we can have the biggest-ever Heavy Stroke.

Without much in the way of spoilers, it’s possible to do much better than 216 / 231 with grave cairn.

I think we're largely in the same place. I've found a couple extra points I could squeeze out, but I'm topping out at 1784.

 

Edit: an even 1800.

Does the no-recursion criterion extend to previous rounds? i.e., there can never be a point previous to the current round during which I've returned a card in the discard pile to the deck, my hand, or into play?

Not really sure where you're going with this, but color me curious. I can't think of any reason why that wouldn't be okay, so I say this is fine. (But if allowing this leads to some sort of infinite or near-infinite loop that trivializes the challenge, then no.)

OK, cool. I don't know if it'll be needed for my stab at this, but it is definitely possible to display permanent board states that can only be created in true solo through the (prior) use of recursion, so. Just wanted to be sure it didn't violate the spirit of your no-arbitrary-loops provisos.

I doubt it. If you really want to get Rosie an arbitrarily large sum of attack, go for it. It's not about to warp the meta; nobody would consistently play this type of deck in a group. Maybe once, solo, just to do it once.

And then there's this: :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I have a deck with every single card in the game. I have drawn them all in hand, with 1000 resources on every hero. My threat level is 0. What's the highest attack I can get on Rosie?

Additionally, the deck required to pull off my current solution would need to be a minimum of 269 cards. (And also getting 4-digit attack values isn't really a practical use of resources.)

If you take away the limits I set at the top, this is going to be stupidly arbitrarily large.

 

Just off the top of my head, if you go with this scenario and remove all the other limitations I set in the opening post, I managed to get Rosie's attack over 500,000,000. I could easily break a billion with just five minutes spent optimizing. Completely optimized I'd wager this is in the tens or even hundreds of billions.

Assuming a reasonable amount of resources each round, how long would it take to set up 269 cards?! XD

Do you mind plotting a curve of the development of her attack power each round? :)

Anyway, I am curious what cards/combinations you guys did dig out!

Use Parting Gifts to move a resource from Elrond to Faramir


Begin the quest phase. Peek at the top of the encounter deck with Henemarth. Commit to the quest with Rosie and Faramir. Use Wingfoot to declare whatever card type Henemarth saw. Ready Rosie with Fast Hitch. Then start readying and exhausting Faramir.

 * 1x from Steed of the Mark (with the resource from Elrond)
 * 3x from Unexpected Courage
 * 3x from Cram
 * 3x from Miruvor
 * 3x from Lembas
 * 3x from The White Council

Use Bartering to remove Sword-thain. Trigger Born Aloft to return Faramir to hand. Use Wizard Pipe to put Sword-thain on top of your deck. Trigger Elrond/Vilya to put it on Rosie. Ready Rosie with her second Fast Hitch.
Sneak Attack Faramir. Exhaust and ready him some more:

 * 1x - natural exhaust
 * 6x - exhaust Rosie to pass a Spare Hood and Cloak, ready Rosie after with Tale of Tinuviel from Sulien, ready Sulien and Faramir again with The Free Peoples, repeat three times. (Rosie satisfies the 9-trait requirement for Free Peoples all by herself.)
 * 3x - To Arms! (Spare Hood and Cloak fulfils the trigger)
 * 1x - Narya (on Gandalf)
 * 3x - Ever Vigilant

Play Bulwark of the West on Faramir (discard a Blood of Numenor from Rosie), then play Rallying Cry to pull him back to hand. Play Good Harvest and name "Leadership". Time to exhaust Faramir some more!

 * 2x - Sneak Attack Faramir / Bulwark of the West / Rallying Cry to pull back to hand
 * 6x - Reinforcements to bring Faramir and Eomund. Exhaust Faramir, play Mutual Accord, discard Eomund to Ride to Ruin, ready Faramir, exhaust Faramir again, discard Faramir to Rear Guard. (Repeat 3 times using all three copies of Faramir.)

Total net = 69 exhausts of Faramir = +69 Willpower to Galadriel and Rosie

Play 3x Pursuing the Enemy to get rid of the Greenwood Archers.
Trigger Born Aloft to get rid of Gandalf.
Trigger Born Aloft to get rid of Saruman, playing Grave Cairn 3x in response for +15 attack on Rosie.

Trigger your final Westfold Outrider to pull another Eastern Crow, trigger Captain of Gondor in response.

You're left with Elrond, Galadriel, Elfhelm, Rosie, and Sulien in play, turning on Strider's +2 WP bonus.

Trigger Rosie on herself to double it to 538, then ready with a Fast Hitch

Rosie's attack is:

 * (+0 Att): natural base
 * (+1 Att): Captain of Gondor (triggered when Westfold Outrider pulled over a crow)
 * (+1 Att): Elfhelm bonus
 * (+3 Att): 3x Dunedain Mark
 * (+9 Att): 3x Tale of Tinuviel with Sulien

=134 Attack

Play 3x Legacy of Numenor, 3x Deep Knowledge and 2x Seeing Stone to reach 40 threat.

Play Hands Upon the Bow to declare an attack against the Eastern Crow in staging.

 * (+1 Att)  : Hands Upon the Bow
 * (+538 Att): Trigger Herugrim in response
 * (+5 Att)  : Discard Black Arrow

Play a Valour Open the Armory. Pull an Elven-spear, discard Herugrim.

 * (+3 Att)  : Elven-spear

Play a Valour Open the Armory. Pull an Elven-spear, discard the old Elven-spear.

Play 2x Galadhrim's Greetings to drop threat to 28, then play

 * (+9 Att)  : 3x Unseen Strike
 * (+539 Att): Fair and Perilous
 * (+539 Att): Fair and Perilous
 * (+539 Att): Fair and Perilous

= 2311 total attack

(Speculative: is it possible to play two more Hands Upon the Bow for an additional +2 attack, bringing you to 2313? Am unsure.)

 

High-quality jank that didn't make the cut:
Originally I included Tom Cotton and played all of Rosie's stuff in one planning phase to give her Friend of Friends and Cotton's +2 attack bonus.

At one point I replaced Tom Cotton with Sam Gamgee and used Desperate Alliance to pass away Galadriel, opening up Strength of Arms to ready Faramir three more times.

At one point I committed Rosie to the quest alone so I could trigger Scouting Party three times, then used Late Adventurer to commit Faramir (to take advantage of Elwing's Flight) and Ally Arwen (to give Faramir sentinel). This got scrapped once I switched to Sword-thaining Faramir.

At one point I was unsure of how Herugrim worked and whether it would be legal to bring in another copy using Open the Armory, declare another attack with Hands Upon the Bow, then trigger it again for another bonus. (I don't think this works, but if it does we should be able to get over 3,000 attack.)

At one point I considered ending the sequence by Bartering away Rosie's Sword-thain again to activate Sword of Morthond + Outlands bonus, but you lose more buffs by losing Hero status than you gain by gaining Outlands status.

Anyone see any errors? Anything I overlooked that can push this even higher?

It is. But I don't think he needs it in the Quest phase…? He can just Born Aloft Faramir and Vilya in a Sword-Thain pre-set on top of his deck (not a Bartered and Wizard Pipe'd copy), unless I'm missing something.

Born Aloft specifies that it only works on allies, so it's necessary to get the sword-thain off first.

Born Aloft doesn't work on allies.

You could start the game with Beechbone in play and two damage already on Faramir. Add Vigilant Guard to Faramir's setup. During the quest phase you use three quick strikes on Beechbone (mixed in between the global readying effects), trigger his response each time, and move the damage to Faramir. This gets Faramir out of play for you and frees you up to Vilya another Sword-thain onto Rosie. Use a Gandalf's Search to stack one on top of your library instead. Put Faramir's Born Aloft on Beechbone instead and you stay under Strider threshold.

 

This gives you one less option for recurring Faramir, which costs you one ready. Because of the way willpower gets multiplied, each lost ready costs you 16 total attack, so this should put Rosie at 2295 attack.

 

@sappidus [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/251007-sappidus/] also mentioned that I could put the Celebrian's Stone on Galadriel to begin instead of the Mirkwood Long-knife, (which means she no longer needs elf-friend). This nets her +1 WP and lets me start with the third elven-spear on Rosie for +3 attack. Then I can use a Long Lake Trader to move Celebrian's stone over to Rosie after Nenya. In order to remain under Strider threshold I can use Desperate Alliance to send away one of my heroes.


This nets me +1 willpower and +3 attack, which because of the way willpower gets multiplied means 11 more attack. This gets me back up to 2306.

My solution is very similar, as I arrived at the same general strategy of using Galadriel/Faramir during the quest phase, swapping Sword-thain from Faramir to Rosie mid-phase. My solution varies in a couple aspects:

1. I have willpower-granting item attachments like Celebrian's Stone, Mirkwood Long-knives, Necklace of Girion, etc. on Galadriel, then once I use Nenya I move those attachments to Rosie using Long-lake Traders (who get readied plenty with Grim Resolve)

2. I get Sword-thain off of Faramir by using Treebeard hero + Song of Mocking. After I use Galadriel, I also kill her off with Treebeard + Song of Mocking. If you've dealt 4 damage to Treebeard during the resource phase, 3 damage to Galadriel during the planning phase, and 2 damage to Faramir in the planning phase, you should be able to kill off Faramir/Galadriel/Treebeard all in the quest phase, freeing up Sword-thain for Rosie (played via Vilya) and also activating Strider.

3. Then there are some really minor differences about certain attachments, like I used a different song on Faramir so that all the Songs of Hope could go on Galadriel/Rosie for maximum potential.

4. I did miss a few of these tricks though, like being able to play Bulwark by discarding a player card attachment. Neat!

Vigilant Guard would be a better solution to killing off Faramir and Galadriel so you can keep the Songs of Mocking on Rosie for the WP boost. And using Beechbone instead of Treebeard lets you keep Elfhelm in your lineup for another +2 WP / +1 attack net on Rosie. (Also, Song of Hope is limited one per hero, so you can put one on Rosie, one on Galadriel, and one on Faramir without sacrificing anything.)

 

Necklace of Girion is a good candidate to move via Long Lake Trader, though. That'd get me another +2 WP on Galadriel, which would get multiplied out to +16 attack on Rosie for a total of 1322.

Can Beechbone trigger enough times to kill off both heroes? I don't think he can.

Combining both should get you enough damage to kill Elrond as well after he's done with Vilya. This would let you use 3x Strength of Arms one of the times you sneak Faramir in.

Good point.

He can trigger three times with Quick Strikes, which is enough to kill off Faramir provided he entered the round with two damage already. I never needed to kill off any other heroes to get under the Strider threshold.

 

Good point about Strength of Arms. I had an iteration that used Elfhelm + Hero Sam + Galadriel before I was using Vilya to double-dip on Sword-thain, and I Desperate Allianced away Galadriel to open up Strength of Arms. If I used Treebeard instead of Elfhelm I could kill off Galadriel, Hero-Faramir, and himself, then Desperate Alliance away Elrond to open up Strength of Arms. The biggest problem is if you're triggering Faramir after Galadriel is gone (and presumably has already Nenya'd), you're not double-dipping on his willpower bonus.

 

Still, swapping out Elfhelm (who gives +2 WP / +1 Att) for Treebeard so I can Strength of Arms for +3 WP should result in a +7 attack net. So 1329 attack.
