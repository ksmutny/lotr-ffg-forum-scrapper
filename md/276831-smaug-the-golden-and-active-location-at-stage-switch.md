# [Smaug the Golden and active location at stage switch](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/276831-smaug-the-golden-and-active-location-at-stage-switch/)

Another uncertainty - played "The Lonely Mountain" (Hobbit OTD quest 2) solo recently. Was a bit unsure on how to play the following:

At stage 2, I quested successfully (as per FAQ 1.24, determined before placing progress), with 5 progress already on Smaug the Golden. The Forced effect on stage 2B adds a progress to Smaug (making 6) - the Forced effect on Smaug advances me to stage 4A. I'd assume as it's a new stage, I wouldn't add my progress to stage 4B - but what about any active location (which was there at stage 2B)? Do I add progress to it or not?

I think you would add progress to the location and new quest card. One treachery from the Angmar Awakened cycle switches the current quest, but you can still make progress on the new one.

As usual I agree with Wandalf. Changing the quest doesn't prevent you from putting progress. It is the same things when you change the quest during enemy (happens in several quests in the game) if nothing say the phase is over you can continue to kill other enemies

Interesting! So if you are both right (and I have no reason to believe otherwise), if there was enough progress made that phase to put at least 7 progress on the quest, the scenario would cycle straight through stage 4.a and 4.b back to 2.b. Tweak Smaug the Magnificent's tail, then put him straight back to bed!

Alas, it seems that Smaug doesn't like lullabies! I posed the question to FFG:

Q. "A question from The Lonely Mountain quest (Hobbit OTD quest 2). I am a bit unsure on how to play the following: At stage 2, I quested successfully (as per FAQ 1.24, determined before placing progress), with 5 progress already on Smaug the Golden. The Forced effect on stage 2B adds a progress to Smaug the Golden (making 6) - the Forced effect on Smaug advances me to stage 4A. I have yet to place any progress tokens. Can I place them on the active location (which was in place during the questing?). If I quest well enough, can I also place any remainder on stage 4B, even though it wasn't the stage I originally quested against?"

A. "The answer is that after you advance to a new stage, any remaining progress is canceled. This comes from page 22 of the original core rules: “Additional progress tokens earned against the quest do not carry over to the next stage.” I understand why this isn’t obvious because the core rules definitely did not account for the unique mechanics of The Lonely Mountain, but the scenario was built around this idea. If you could defeat stage 4B immediately after advancing to that stage, it would negate the entire purpose for that stage existing in the adventure. I hope you’re enjoying The Hobbit saga expansions! Cheers, Caleb"

So no progress placed - on either location or quest!

It does tally with my understanding of quest stage changes - to me, when you start quest resolution is when the "current quest" gets fixed...if it changes after that, progress is not carried over (my interpretation).

But how does this explain not being able to place progress on the location, at the very least?

Edit: I guess because progress is always placed on the quest, and active locations just siphon it off?
