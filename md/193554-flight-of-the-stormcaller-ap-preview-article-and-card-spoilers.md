If you read the article, it turns out that some of those spoiled cards actually do not come from this AP.  It says that the Eldahir ally, for example, comes from "later in the cycle."

Wowwy! Some of the most interesting cards I have seen in this game. The new trend seems to be cards that have effects that need outofsphere resources to trigger. Dwarven Sellsword is really good ally to do some things in a pince.

Glorfindel ally is great if you can play him from the discard pile with Caldara. But also it doesn't matter that he gets discarded. Effect is great.

Unique Hobbiy ally and Shirrif! Awesome. Effect mwha.

Inspiring Presence is great in a Hobbit deck with Treebeard or Sam. Especially Sam. Merry and Pippin powerrrr up!

That spoiled art from Glorfindel is some event at least! ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

Eldahir is cool! One of that dualsphere cards that buff dualsphere haha, nice!

Tides of Fate is a rescue card and I don't really like to play that way. A bit too tricksy. But powerfull if you can pull it off.

Excited for this cycle man!!

Way too cool!

This will be the best cycle to date.

Love the mix effects on the player cards.

As in pay a spirit icon on a lore card, or the players as a group can pay for effects.

Way to go Caleb & crew!

Yeah... this is gonna be amazing. I suspect so many dual or tri-sphere archetypes, be it Silvan, Noldor, Rohan, Hobbits, and a long etc, will be greatly boosted and be fixed of their weaknesses. Finally cards that work with 2 spheres! This will be just so great. Kind of a bummer that they pretty much spoiled the whole cycle, but I'm anxious to fight a huge sea monster.

Just too much traffic it seems. Not at all surprising, this is one amazing spoiler article. Also, that Dwarven Sellsword will be nuts in the Thorin's Company deck. Turn 1 Record Keeper and Sellsword for just 2 resources, and you already have the 5 dwarves to get more of Thorin's resources and keep the Sellsword around. Great stuff, can't be more excited for this.

I love that Inspiring Presence works perfectly with Gandalf, he can pay for both costs when playing off the top of the deck!

We usually get 9 new cards per pack right? The article says a leadership hero and three copies each of 10 player cards!

I know it's only 1 more card but still <3

The dual sphere stuff is interesting, but making the second sphere resources able to come from any player is brilliant.  One of my main complaints about most cooperative games is that you're basically playing solo at the same time, with very little opportunity to help each other.  LOTR has always been an exception to that, and this just ramps that up even more.  The potential for multi-deck synergy is going to open up a LOT of interesting paths.

## 13 [gandalfDK on November 14, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/193554-flight-of-the-stormcaller-ap-preview-article-and-card-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=1893059)

Is it so that Inspiring Presence buffs ALL other heroes in play? Thus meaning if you choose Gandalf, all other heroes get 2 def +? Then pay the leadership resources and you can even give every other hero +2 att.

That would be epic

I love that Glorfindel ally, particularly the theme they managed to capture with him coming from the discard pile. Maybe the closest we will get to a Silmarillion reference  :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

I love the new Glorfindel ally. Since I still mostly play solo or 2 player, I don't care as much for playing him. He's also made me reconsider the hero lineup in my ideal Noldor deck, as I originally had Glorfondel in it, along with Cirdan and Erestor, but probably I'll just add Elrond. But man, Glorfindel ally is great in that deck, he feels almost the same as his hero version, just add Swordthain. In a Caldara deck he'll work great as well, fueling your discard pile as well as being one of the best allies to play with her ability.

Inspiring Presence is also really good on Theoden (Sp) because it's in-sphere and Theoden has a very high threat cost.   Cant wait to see the rest of these half-spoiled cards, like Arrows from the Trees which looks great (visually).  

Glorfindel is really good if you can pay for him.  When I play spirit and I think about how many times I have 5 resources,  forget it   =p.  Might be a problem with Inspiring Presence too.   But Caldara maybe, and there's always Steward if you're splashing Ld.  

Most of the art on these cards is really, really impressive.   Great looking pack!

These cards look amazing, they are really nailing it in the gameplay department. Also nice to see the 1st 5 cost spirit ally.

Yeah, imagine him boarding your ship with that malicious grin changing into confusion as he sets foot on your deck without looking and gets trapped by the ranger spikes lying on it :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] And after the quest ends, heroes surround him and start asking: "You seem like such a nice guy, why are you doing this? There are plenty of other ways to earn the coin..." :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

What's a shiriff, by the way? I thought the word was sheriff. Or they changed it because a shiriff is a sheriff of the Shire?

 

Dwarf Sellsword is a 3/3/2/4 ally at the initial cost of 1. But I like that they finally decided to implement some kind of mercenary into the game.

I agree with Narsil, that enemy, much like the Southron Mercenaries from HoN, look actually pretty heroic. I'm really looking forward to these Corsair enemies, particularly Sahír. I like his name, sounds very Haradrim/Southron-ish. I wonder if he's going to be a main enemy in the cycle or if we'll just kill him off in the first pack. In any case, I like the premise of retrieving an ancient Numenorean relic from the pirates. I hope that this cycle relics and artifacts get more attention player card wise.

"What kind of person sets up a trap on the deck of their own ship?"

 

I'm not sure of the reasoning - though I think the etymological origin is something like 'Shire-reave', so I guess shirriff is closer - but shirriff is how they're referred to throughout the scouring of the Shire.

 

Dwarven Sellsword strikes me as kind of the opposite of an Ent - both give you more stats than you pay the value of, but the Ent has the disadvantage that you don't get to use them the first round you play it, whereas the Sellsword has the disadvantage that you'll end up paying more over time if you want continued use instead of just the quick burst of power.

 

 

Ally Glorfindel makes me incredibly excited for the possibilities in Caldara or Noldor decks (so long as I can persuade my friends to ditch the hero version).

In general, I love the idea of boosting effects with resources spent from other spheres, especially since it's the players as a group. Tides of Fate could be fun, and as I've found with Boomed and Trumpeted, an attack boost of 3 is enough that it doesn't really matter if the defending character didn't have very good attack to start with. Robin Smallburrow is another 2 cost 2 willpower ally in Lore so should see a lot of play even without the ability, and Inspiring Presence could be bonkers in the right context.

Now we know which kind of card would beat spirit Glorfindel:

 

spirit Glorfindel! ^_^ [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_happy.png]

 

Cards are looking great, though solo players are a bit restricted in their deck building with the new effects.

 

That hobbit is great and likely an auto-include even without his special ability. So far into the lore sphere only Mablung and these OP Ents have 2 WP for 2 cost.

I wonder what they mean about the support of decks with only two heroes. The pseudo dual cards certainly don't fit into this idea, unless I am missing something crucial...

Well, I suppose something like:"Cost: 0. Raise the cost to play this event by 2 for each hero you control. Action: Draw 50 cards." There are numerous ways to boost two-heroed decks, we probably just haven't seen them yet. We haven't seen mentioned Gondor support either.

Too bad the two cards I wanna see more of don't have their text visible.

 

"Heed the Dream". Dat art. Lore event maybe Gondor-related.

 

"Arrows in the Trees", I'm really hoping for a Trap event as :

- Anborn can retrieve a "Trap card" and not only attachments

- Dmarod can reduce the cost of "Trap card"

The art certainly does look trappy.

I'd appreciate also if this was to be a Lore-tactics combination of boosted event. Rangers of Ithilien are what I like the most, so a non-unique Tactics Gondorian Ranger would be cool too with some sort of defensive capability, Henneth Annûn Guard was a real miss (man, he's not even a Ranger...).

Wow! I am pretty sure Dwarven Sellsword is going to accelerate my Dain/Thorin/Ori deck.  Not sure what I'll have to take out to include those, though.  That card will make it so much easier to get 5 Dwarves on the first turn.

 

Honestly, most of these cards look really good!

> I would have liked that they would have boosted Secrecy first a bit more.

 

I have always thought in hindsight that Secrecy should have functioned more like Valour.  Valour is a game state which serves as a prerequisite for various effects.  Secrecy was only a cost reduction.  Later cards specifically work off of <=20 threat, but I wish it were designed more diversely from the start because we'd probably have deeper support for the feature by now.

 

In any case, more secrecy style effects - even dual-effect cards like Honour Guard - would be welcome.

Yeah, I mean the "below 20 threat do this"-thing. The cost reduction was fun but not that viable in terms of ideas and stuff. As you say, like with the Valour, that's great. Also the cards we do have are fun, but more would be better.

No reason they couldn't implement "Secrecy Action/Response" triggers at this point in the game. It would operate just like "Valour Action/Response" and wouldn't affect the existing Secrecy X keyword, either.

As someone who always hated HoN's focus on Mono-Sphere, I am a very happy man right. now.

 

And I love that they are FINALLY giving Spirit players some reason to try and not use Glorfindel other than "he's too good". 

 

And as someone who's two favorite decks right now are a pair of Dwarf decks and an Imrahil/Eomer chump deck...dat Dwarven Sellsword tho...
