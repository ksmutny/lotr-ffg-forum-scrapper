# [Why is there no official GenCon event for this game?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/176085-why-is-there-no-official-gencon-event-for-this-game/)

I'm not trying to be a naysayer or griper here. I just have an honest question. I see there are a couple of GenCon events for this game from a couple of highly regarded podcasting groups but there aren't any events put out by FFG. Is there a story behind this I'm missing? Does anyone know what the podcasters have planned?

That's really strange... yesterday FFG had three fellowship events on the official list (I still have the file on my PC). "CGM15738: The Lord of the Rings Fellowship Event - Murder at the Prancing Pony"

 

Now those events are gone. I speculate that it's a purely clerical issue that will hopefully be resolved soon.

 

 

 

The Grey Company and Cardboard of the Rings are both hosting events. 

 

Historically, CotR has been pretty hush-hush about the particulars of their Special Listener Events - especially when it comes to the swag. I imagine those guys will be spoiling a bit on their podcast as the event approaches.

 

The Grey Company had an unofficial gathering last year. This is their first official GenCon event. Once again, they'll probably spoil a bit in the coming weeks.

 

Bottom line, you show up to these events to play the game, enjoy good company, and maybe get a little swag.

It is very strange that the event has not been relisted yet, since this has been a well received event for the past few years. Wonder what happened?

Was wondering the same thing. This has historically been one of my must do events at Gencon.

There was an error made when posting this year's Gen Con event for The Lord of the Rings LCG: "Murder at the Prancing Pony" is not the correct title. The event was temporarily taken down from Gen Con's website to fix that mistake. It should be visible again later today.

The event is taking place, and it will be awesome!

I hope to see you there!

Love the username, Caleb! I'm on the wrong side of the Atlantic for GenCon, unfortunately.

 

Is there any info on when Fog on the Barrow-Downs may be released as a PoD scenario? We just recently acquired The Old Forest and have had tons of fun with it.

Let's hope Bombadil posts more often.

Thank goodness! I came here for this very reason, lol. The FFG LOTR event is always the top of my event "Must Do" list.

I'm sad to be on the wrong hemisphere of Earth for GenCon, but I hope it will be great!

Thanks for the link. The thing is that shipping to Sweden doubles the price, so I need to think quite carefully about it - I could get a whole expansion for the same price. I've been hoping that Barrow-Downs will be distributed to more local retailers like Lake-Town and Massing at Osgiliath have.

I know! I wish Thebookdepository would sell POD scenarios, that'd be so cool.

They have some listed but almost always unavailable....

So I'm seeing three events on Thurs-Sat at 7pm. I'm assuming that these are just so enough people have a chance to get the scenario, not that there are three different scenarios... It would be nice if there was some clarification on this.

Yay! Caleb on the forums!

Welcome! Our glorious overlord!  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

 

Do we have the proper name for the gen con event??? Murder at the Prancing Pony sounds pretty silly so not surprised it is wrong/fake haha. I wonder if it will be a fellowship event for the second or third box... and will it will contain!

Well, considering that they make these scenarios months in advance, I guess the theme/location of the quest will be the same, that is, it will still take place at the Prancing Pony most probably, or at least Bree, especially if you consider they most likely already commisioned the art for it so they wouldn't just suddenly change it. So I suppose it will be more or less the same, save for the name.

I just checked the Gen Con website and while "Murder at the Prancing Pony" is not there, I didn't see the new title. :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

and fellowship event indicates that it is a POD scenario that can be included and played in Saga mode as part of your campaign right?

The event is up now.

They always do the events at several different days/times each year just to give as many people as possible a chance to play the scenario.

I wouldn't say that.

So what's the new name of the scenario then?

## 24 [Olorin93 on May 14, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/176085-why-is-there-no-official-gencon-event-for-this-game/?do=findComment&comment=1620422)

I can't see a name on the GenCon website, just "Fellowship Event".
