So the inspiring presence article for the city of corsairs pack had this in it 

>  
> 
> For two Spirit resources, you choose a hero, and the card grants two bonus points of Defense Strength to every hero with a lower threat cost than your chosen hero until the end of the phase. Perhaps this allows Beregond [https://images-cdn.fantasyflightgames.com/filer_public/a5/24/a5246fe0-4e7d-4fc8-8409-ba634355993b/mec54-beregond-spirit.png] (The Flame of the West, 3) to defend two powerful attacks and reduce a player's threat by two. Perhaps it allows Boromir [https://images-cdn.fantasyflightgames.com/filer_public/b5/87/b5875ccd-8587-47e4-b3fd-85a6da9857d1/boromir.png] (The Dead Marshes, 95) to make a final stand against a whole ship's worth of Corsair Raiders. Either way, as with most of the "kicker" events, Inspiring Presence gains more value the more players you have at the table, meaning that you can pursue strategies in your largest multiplayer games that you might not play in solo or even two-player games.

 

So here is the question, how exactly does Beregond drop someones threat by 2, when his ability is once per round. Is this just a mistake on FFG's part, or have i been playing this wrong?

It has to be a mistake.

 

I guess the question is whether the mistake is the "Limit once per round" text on Beregond or if the mistake is the article.  I'm going to have to assume the article is incorrect unless someone asks the developers and receives a different answer.

I noticed that too when I read the article. It has to be a mistake.

The marketing people have been known to make quite a few mistakes in the past, at least for the other LCGs. The A:NR community has a good laugh/bellyache every time it happens in their game.
