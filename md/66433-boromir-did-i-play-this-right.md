 Boromir just saved the day for me but I want to make sure I played it correctly.

I was on Stage 2B of Flight from Moria, in the quest card Ëscape from Darkness."  The only way to place progress tokens on the quest is with Abandoned Tools, which says "Refresh Action: Exhaust attached hero to put a progress token on Escape from Darkness."

Well, I gave Abandoned Tools to Boromir and let him Ready 4 times in a row instantly with his ability.  It raised my threat by 4, but who cares.  I instantly placed 4 progress tokens on Escape from Darkness with Abandoned Tools and the game was over.

Was I allowed to do this?

Yep.

The effect on Abandoned Tools isn't limited to a set number of times per round. Similarly, Boromir's ability can be triggered as many times as you like during a given action window (provided you raise your threat by 1 each time). There is a player action window during the refresh phase, so Boromir can indeed ready and exhaust multiple times to complete that stage of Flight From Moria.

Yes.

My friends and I have two different "Best Scores" for Flight From Moria - one with Boromir and one without.  Our best score without Boromir is over twice our best with him. 

Our best with him was a win on the second turn …
