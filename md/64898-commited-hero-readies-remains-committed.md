Hello mates

I recently got The Dead Marshes and I came up with a question. After committing Eowyn to the quest and having attached Unexpected Courage I face one of the many Treachery Cards that ask the players to take an Escape Test. If Eowyn readies with U.C. to take the Test is she still considered Committed to the Quest? I believe they do unless I have misundertood the related paragraph in the Rulebook, pg 14, that says "the characters are considered committed to the Quest until the end of the phase unless removed by a card effect".

Thanks in advance!

characters remain 'commited' until the end of the quest phase regardless of whether they ready or not

If you ready Eowyn after she has committed to the quest, she is still considered to be committed to that quest for the duration of the quest phase, even though she is not exhausted.

It is important to note the timing of using Unexpected Courage. You can use it right after you commit characters to the quest, before revealing any cards from the encounter deck. You could also use Unexpected Courage after all cards have been revealed and resolved (though at that point it would be too late to participate in an escape test). What you cannot do is leave Eowyn exhausted and wait until an escape test is revealed to ready Eowyn with Unexpected Courage. This is because UC requires and action and there is no action window while cards are being revealed from the encounter deck.

Thanks a lot guys! Just as I thought! But the last about UC timing really turned everything upside down because to be honest I never showed much attention to the Time Sequence Table at the end of the Rulebook. It says clearly that players cannot interrupt with Actions in red windows! Such a small thing but too much trouble when being unnoticed…  I feel such a fool… My sister in coop having UC attached to Eleanor cancelled Treacheries twice whenever required in the Encounter Card Revealing sequence! Major mistake mates! I think we have to replay everything from the beginning…  And I tried so hard to be legal… 

Thank you again! I have a lot of up catching to do!
