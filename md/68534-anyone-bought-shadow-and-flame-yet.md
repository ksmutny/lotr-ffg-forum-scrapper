With the first Hobbit Sage expansion announced to be launched in "mid-August" I was wondering if the Shadow and Flame expantion is on sale elsewhere. I have not found it here in shopsÂ here in Denmark or on Amazon (but Amazon is usually a bit slow to get it).

Maybe we will be able to buy both S&F and the Saga expansions at the same time.
