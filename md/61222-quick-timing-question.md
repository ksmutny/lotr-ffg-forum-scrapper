One of my hero's managed to get "Caught in a Web".  However I drew "Unexpected Courage" and attached it to that same hero.  My question is can I use the action to offset the "Caught in the Web"'s condition to still add a resource during the refresh phase of the next turn? 

Thanks.

So what you are saying is that the hero gets the resourse whether he is exhaused or not.  Did I get that right?

yeah, they would have to otherwise youd never have the resources to ready the hero

there are similar treachery cards that actually state 'hero does not collect resources' so yeah, CIAW they do, you just dont ready 'naturally' in the refresh phase unless you pay 2 tokens each turn till you get rid of the card
