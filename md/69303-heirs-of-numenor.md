Hooray!!! Very exciting news!!! I suppose we'll be seeing some evil men and Mordor with them.

I'm calling:

Heroes:

Faramir Hero Card

Beregond Hero Card

(I need to reread LOTR to come up with anything else)

Maybe new versions of Denethor and Boromir (second more likely)

Unlikely (straight from LOTR) but possible, "Pippin, Guard of the Citadel"

Allies:

Osgiliath Rangers (or other rangers of the south.

Gondorian Cavalry.

Attachments:

Guards of the White Tower

White Tower Armor

Locations:

The White Tree

THE WHITE CITY!!!!!!

Yes come time for Gondor. I like the idea. Sounds like we will have some epic battles in Osgiliath and around Minas-Morgul!

## 9 [richsabre on August 17, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69303-heirs-of-numenor/?do=findComment&comment=675502)

im expecting a good news article on this when you get back from gen con ffg…hint hint haha

i think theres alot for the designers to do here….i mean firstly you have all the fiefdoms of gondor- that makes for a huge amout of choice in player cards. then you have mordor literally on its doorstep, so no shortage of enemies. then to the south you have harad, umbar, ships ….man so much potential here

Quite excited about it being Gondor. Although Heirs of Númenor may also refer to the remnants of Arnor. Really excited about the synergies, and we shall probably see Denethor, Boromir and Faramir all for the second time.

What scares me a bit is the huge gap between Hobbit part 1 and 2. Four months without new cards, how is a card addict to survive that?

Not bad… after that Rohan? Well, maybe, maybe not. But Gondor is good plase to have adventures!

Gondor is better later, when Saruman the white becomes Saruman manycolored… Much later in time scale. So there is much room before that.

Looks like this  cycle will be kind of Siege of Gondor or somethings….? Remind me last block of Decipher Lotr tcg…….Better if they will make other another story about Arnor for example they are also Heir of Dunadan.

does anyone know what happens here in the Lord of the Rings, before the main story starts? I'm wondering if FFG are still going to stick with their pre-Fellowship of the Rings timeline, and whether there is something in the Appendicies that will give us a clue as to what the quests are going to be about.

Basically Gondor is in decline because it has been holding off Mordor, which has been rising in the East. Minas Morgul, the city of the Witch-King, was far in the past the Eastern Minas Ithil (Tower of the Moon) to Minas Anor (Tower of the Sun), later Minas Tirith (Tower of the Citadel/Guard) in the West. All of Ithilien used to be the possession of Gondor, but lands west of the Anduin gradually succumbed to Mordor's rising power. The once great city of knowledge and capital city of Gondor, Osgiliath, fell in TA 2475 to uruks, and the Great Bridge was destroyed. Boromir regained the city in TA 3018, which was lost during the War of the Ring (TA 3018-19). The city may or may not have been rebuilt in the Fourth Age under Elessar/Aragorn (richsabre would you like to edit/add here?)

edit: here's the text from the back in case it was hard to read:

War shadows the land of Gondor. The minions of the Dark Lord pour forth from Minas Morgul as cruel Southrons march north. In The Lord of the Rings - Heirs of Numenor players battle through three new scenarios, defending Gondor against the encroaching might of the Enemy. In addition to powerful encounter and quest cards, Heirs of Numenor includes two new heroes and a variety of player cards that increase customization options of The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game.

The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game is a cooperative game where players assemble a fellowship and join together to resist the threat of the Dark Lard.

If I don't remember wrong. The Aragorn served in Gondor in different name before the War of the Ring. So there is a lot happenig before the Gandalf rides to Minas Tirith to read some old documents.

 

## 36 [Gizlivadi on August 19, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69303-heirs-of-numenor/?do=findComment&comment=676760)

 What can I say, this is probably going to be my favourite product for this game for all time (it is now, just judging by the premise). I just hope it won't overshadow the actual siege of Gondor that happened in the ROTk, but a good FOREshadow of it, with corsairs and southrons and all, is just amazing. The art on the back of the box looks maybe a little dark (though generally the art in this game is a little too dark) but still looking great as always. Can't wait for it.

i'd rather not, for a while anyway. besides the tactics hero in this expansion is Beregond.  the other hero will probably be Leadership, since we got Spirit and Lore heroes in Khazad-Dum

Nothing at all, just a complete guess. We have to get Ents at some point, and I doubt we'll see a Fangorn Forest cycle/expansion (since that would be awfully similar to all the Mirkwood business). On the other hand, Ents seem more like objectives (a la Grimbeorn) than allies to be included in any deck. 

I'm just looking forward to the Army of the Dead (fingers crossed).

## 49 [lleimmoen on August 21, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69303-heirs-of-numenor/?do=findComment&comment=678114)

Well, I would be disappointed to say the least if Ents are not player cards. I feel we have got to get other Creature allies beside Eagles.

If I am to guess when the Ents appear though, it would have to be Rohan but sooner we get them the better.

yes i actually think it is likely we shall go into fangorn, as you say in the rohan cycle. i dont think its similarity to mirkwood is a problem….after all it will have been while since mirkwood cycle

im sure ffg will be able to make them both different

as for what i think numenor pack will bring….im hoping hobbits….dont know why, just do

Hard to tell really. Aragorn and Glorfindel both switched spheres. Beorn on the other hand, coming from ally to hero (so just as what we expect from Faramir), remained Tactics.

For me, I feel Faramir does belong to Leadership. And since Beregond is going to be Tactics… those two sphere fall well together somehow.

Finally, I wonder whether we should see another Boromir. Given we will likely see 8 new heroes (2 for deluxe and 6 per the cycles) I think we might. And then again, I feel there might be a switch from Tactics to Leadership. It is hard for me to imagine a better fitting ability though, Tactics Boromir seems perfect to me.

Good points! And 6 cycle heroes. Anyone feel like engaging in pointless speculation about the HoN Cycle heroes? Perhaps we should wait and keep the suspense lower until we see previews for Hobbit II

staying with my hobbit prediction- Pippin, merry, sam (which is equivalent to getting the elrond family in dwarrowdelf) thus completeing our 4 main hobbits. the other 3 will be gondor related, possibly from the different fiefdoms……there is a page in the minas tirith chapter of Return of the King that name all the lords that come to the city's aid- im going with them

Are Hobbits really thematic for Gondor though? I suppose the same could be said for the Noldor in Dwarrowdelf, or miscellaneous hobbits/men in Mirkwood, but at least several quests were connected to Rivendell and the surrounding area in the case of the former (I can't explain the latter). Maybe the heroes in the APs need not be thematic to the cycle since the game is about building your own fellowship (from all of the cards) to go on quests.

im not basing it on anything other than that of course! just a hunch! and besides its time we had the most central race in middle earth developed on….

Leadership Faramir Hero is all i want to see!

 

 

I kinda think Faramir as a hero will belong in a different sphere, simply because Faramir as an ally is Leadership. We'll see, though, I guess!

 

 

Hard to tell really. Aragorn and Glorfindel both switched spheres. Beorn on the other hand, coming from ally to hero (so just as what we expect from Faramir), remained Tactics.

For me, I feel Faramir does belong to Leadership. And since Beregond is going to be Tactics… those two sphere fall well together somehow.

Finally, I wonder whether we should see another Boromir. Given we will likely see 8 new heroes (2 for deluxe and 6 per the cycles) I think we might. And then again, I feel there might be a switch from Tactics to Leadership. It is hard for me to imagine a better fitting ability though, Tactics Boromir seems perfect to me.



Leadership Faramir definitely makes the most sense, but if they really wanted to they could also do a Lore style Faramir hero.  They could go off of all the references in the book to him being a "wizard's apprentice" (not a direct quote, can't remember how it was worded) with how fond he was of Gandalf whenever he would show up to the White City.  And given that they made Aragorn Leadership/Lore, it seems likely to do the same with him, given their similarities in character.

I'm thinking of Spirit for Faramir, his huge willpower in resisting the Ring seems to rest more with that sphere. The idea of Beorn staying as Tactics though is a good point!

Just to answer the Hobbit prediction, I feel there will be Lord of the Rings saga - though I am not sure how it shall be named within the Lord of the Rings card game, haha. And for that saga we shall see Samwise, Meriadoc and Peregrin, and Fredegar also, I hope.

id be dissapointed if ffg concentrated too much on this saga thing…..not the fact that were getting the books as a saga- that is basically a must so it doesnt mess up the current system…no, my problem would be them holding off on 3 of the main characters just to release as a saga edition. id much rather see them sooner rather than later….unless of course im wrong in assuming ffg will (assuming it does at all) wait a considerable time before releasing another sage pack…..after all the trilogy would be a much bigger taking than the hobbit. to do it justice theyd have to make at least 6 saga packs….2 for each book.

rich, I think we might be more like 2 for each book (as in 12 packs; for six books, two in each volume). This might be excessive to some but I think that it would make for a fairly comprehensive experience. Even if FFG just did a spare pack for each of the big battles (Helm's Deep, Pelennor Fields, etc.) that would still make for 8-9 packs.

I don't see FFG releasing more than two saga packs a year (we've already got our two until next autumn (even though we still haven't officially heard about Hobbit II, probably later this week or next week). I'd bet that we get the LotR Saga over 3-4 years, here's my thoughts as to how the next year of releases looks:

Battle of Lake-Town; Hobbit II; HoN (Deluxe); HoN (cycle); FotR Saga I?; Gen-Con 2013 PoD?; FotR Saga II?, etc.

This seems reasonable. Also limiting the saga releases to two a year keeps the game going longer, which I think is a good thing.

As to your point about the other hobbits, I'm coming around to your view (bold quote above, give them to us sooner than later), after all who doesn't like Sam the best? (uh-oh thread derailing question!!!)

yeah, the CEO mentioned "6 weeks after Hobbit II" and Hobbit II was to come out around the movie (i.e. December) -- but that doesn't seem to mesh with the announcement today, what the "Upcoming" page states, and what FFG put on their FB page today, which is HoN comes out in Q4.

so, perhaps things have changed?

Also something to keep in mind, in a lot of buisnesses, Q4 does not end until the end of march, and begins in January.  This change from what the logical arrangement would be is due to the end of the fiscal year.  In which case, HoN will probably come out the same time as Kazad-um did earlier this year.

this seems highly unlikely to me, as it would cause too much confusion for FLGS and consumers. FFG is notoriously late with products (such as KD) but I think it's a safe wager that their version of Q4 means Oct-Nov-Dec.

I doubt we will see any LOTR books saga expansion since a lot of stuff was already edited (Khazad-dum, Elrond Family, Caradhras, Emyn Muil, …) Another trip to Khazad Dum ? To do what ? Balrog again and again, new dwarves again and again ? Not likely…

Understand me well, I'm a huge fan of the books and of this game, but it seems not possible to me that we get those boxes… Though I would love to find some Helm's Deep stuff or Pelennor Fields battle…

Yes. It is too soon to see the Blarog again. In addition, it wouldn't be good for any company to bring out the most popular stuff in a hurry and to have no trump cards. Better have something in reserve, and thin out the popular stuff…

## 72 [lleimmoen on August 22, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69303-heirs-of-numenor/?do=findComment&comment=679342)

Of course, it seems likely that if we are ever going to see LotR saga it will be in quite some time. My guess is that HoN and AtS cycle will take until the Q3 next year and we shall see a new cycle after that in Q4 again, perhaps around x-mas.

As for the Hobbit and HoN what's coming first, it seems to me they want to keep the saga sort of independent from the deluxe and adventure packs, that is why we saw the Overhill and Underhill only few days after Shadow and Flame. In a similar fashion, we may see the second part of the saga around the same time as HoN.

I was looking at the timing last year around announcements of Khazad and Dwarrodelf and noticed a couple things:

1. Khazad-dum was announed mid september, a month later than Heirs of Numenor so perhaps we will see it a bit sooner than KD.

2. Dwarrodelf and Redhorn Gate were announced around a month after KD so expect to see AtS's announcement mid-September.

War shadows the land of Gondor. The minions of the Dark Lord pour forth from Minas Morgul as cruel Southrons march north. In The Lord of the Rings - Heirs of Numenor players battle through three new scenarios, defending Gondor against the encroaching might of the Enemy. In addition to powerful encounter and quest cards, Heirs of Numenor includes two new heroes and a variety of player cards that increase customization options of The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game.

The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game is a cooperative game where players assemble a fellowship and join together to resist the threat of the Dark Lard.

Darn straight. I want a Thorongil card, darnit, though it should be Lore, and there's already a Loragorn. Perhaps Spirit?… Because that's what the game needs is more awesomesauce for Spirit ;-)

Hm. This makes me think, though: I don't know how it would work, but I'd love to see some sort of  "commander" scenario that forces you to decide how to lead an army. If FFG managed to do that in this expansion, I'd be seriously impressed. There's not much a better place to do it than Gondor.

Unfortunately, we're 20 years too late! It was 2960-2980 that Aragorn was in the service of Denethor's father Ecthelion II. In 2080 he had a great victory against the Corsairs. The game takes place between 3001-3018 when, as we know, Aragorn was hunting for Gollum.

Also, interestingly, in 3007, Aragorn's mother Gilraen died. I wonder if we'll ever see her as a card…

I think we still need some focus on Aragorn though. If not a new version, maybe an attachment that gives a global boost to the Dunedain? The ring of Barahir? If it also gave him the Tactics icon that would be great.

I can't wait to see some weaponry and armour other than for dwarves/elves. I think this will really be Tactics' moment to shine. Like they said in the preview, fighting will be just as important as willpower. I imagine something like you have to protect the front gates, if they get too much damage and are destroyed you get an additional encounter card per turn. Dynamics like this will change the focus of a lot of people's decks I think.

Also just a thought, but I guess Steward of Gondor with be even more of a powerful card now?

It would be foolish to do so. The game is called The Lord of the Rings after all. If they didn't do the novels and just keep on making sets about the time before the actual LOTR story, it would be as if they made a prologue and never showed the outcome of the story. All player cards have a shiny One Ring printed on their backs, and the role of the One Ring only becomes important during the LOTR novels. It would be kinda dumb not to do the story of the novels in its whole, and they can't be that dumb, can they?

I do like these little stories they're making up and the whole Middle-earth setting they're creating, but only if they're to create the tension and atmosphere before the main story takes off. The game won't start to feel complete to me until they begin with Frodo leaving Bag End. After all, they made The Hobbit, maybe as an experiment on making saga expansions based on novels.

I do like these little stories they're making up and the whole Middle-earth setting they're creating, but only if they're to create the tension and atmosphere before the main story takes off. The game won't start to feel complete to me until they begin with Frodo leaving Bag End. After all, they made The Hobbit, maybe as an experiment on making saga expansions based on novels. 

 

 

perhaps….i say perhaps as there is a problme in making the novels- mainly that we have encountered such places/foes that it would feel strange seeing them again and likewise  it would feel strange doing lotr and not seeing them

for example moria and the balrog….we've already seen it twice and been through moria twice, theres only so many ways you can do things like that without it getting stale

now, im not saying i dont want a saga lotr, however i am perfectly happy with the rpg style system of 'create your own adventure' ….in fact i like it as i can read the books if i want lotr, however we never see areas that we can potentially within the game system

for instance we never see anumminas, however on lotro we get to go there and see a certain representation of it….and its nice

And that's precisely why I don't want many different versions of characters/enemies, like so many people are eager to see. However, it would be stranger if they didn't do the novels, since the focus of the Lord of the Rings is the One Ring (so much that they put a picture of it behind every player card) it would be weird if we didn't get a card for it (besides Bilbo's Magic Ring, I mean a proper One Ring card), or if it never got any relevance in the game.

If FFG wants to create saga expansion about the three books of the LOTR, they surely shouldn't have done this Moria cycle… Even if they did not named the Balrog "Balrog" everything else have already been seen… Misty Mountains, Caradhras, Dwarrowdelf, … Even Rivendell…

"The Hobbit" expansion already contains a rebuild of "conflict at the Carrock".I will love it (when it will be out in my country) but it's kind of sad that a year and a half after the initial release they made duplicates of some quest.

Wait and see… I will take anything that will come out of their mind and I can't wait to see Helm's deep battle properly translatted or pelennor's fields battle, etc… But how could they do it properly ?

In my opinion is much better create they own story in ME then copy the books. We alredy do it so many times in other games!

Much better to see for example story about blue mages or going to Harad, fight with umbar pirates and so on. That what make me exiting!!!

I agree…  Not that I would dislike a LOTR saga at some point, but there is so much material that hasn't been touched on from Tolkien's material in other games.  This would be an excellent game to explore that material.  Harad would be an excellent place to base a cycle in.  Rich mentioned Annuminas…  I would LOVE to see something worked around that topic.  I don't know how they would handle some of the "older" material (first- and second-age locations) like that… perhaps sagas instead of full expansions/cycles?  Angmar and the fall of Arnor would provide a wealth of material (they could even create yet another version of Glorfindel to fit thematically… lol)…

yes thats one route and the appendices hold a wealth of material as you say- or they could do the lotro route and sort of make a (lore friendly) storyline where evill creatures have re populated carn dum- not stretching it too far really given who used to live there happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]

I don't understand why people seem to think that one option excludes the other. I DO love this "expanded Middle-earth" route they're going for, I mean, even as a former MECCG player I say this, since that game had LOTS of that (you could be one of the blue wizards or radagast, you could play as one of the ringwraiths and control forces in Harad, Umbar, etc. There was even a good deal of characters and locations related to the Pukel-men and the Lossoth). I love that they expand on that world, but it just kinda feels incomplete to have a game called "Lord of the Rings:THE Card Game" and not have any magic rings (the first one came a year after the release of the game) or at least THE magic ring. If they're going for that, why not just call it "Adventures in the Third Age" or something, at least that name would make justice to such a  game. So it kinda irritates me that people seem to abhor the idea of making Frodo's journey when they say "Ugh no don't make the books that's boring ugh let's see other stuff that's cool the books are so repetitive". Why not have both? Yes, other games have done that, other games have done both things, but after all the game's called "The Lord of the Rings", it's not like you would choose to play this game without expecting seeing the book's story done at some point. 

End rant.

Also, on the Balrog name thing, it's not like MaO is the last time we're gonna see The Witch King, so they could just print another card named Durin's Bane that just plays different.

these are all fair points-however i disagree on two points

1.doing the entire volumes from start to finish would take many packs and cycles…you could barely fit a book in each major cycle. this game was obviously set out in the beginning to NOT follow the main storyline. now i assume ffg has planned the future, so to take on such a major re-development of the game that would last for several years…now you could say, well condense it all into a few less pack…but is that doing it justice? bringing me onto my next point….

2.this game has a lifetime, and lets assume that ffg did end up undertaking such a major development. not only would it mean putting all else on hold, but it would also effectively end the game..after we got the return of the king pack and see sauron overthrown, saruman die and the shire saved, what then? do we go back out where we left off and go back into lothlorien, morder, rohan?

i think all this points to 1 thing….if ffg do this it will be a major development, and it will be far into the future of the game.

i do not think it is a bad idea at all to do the books, and i sure as hell dont find it boring….however its more a case of the practicality of the matter

ive always seen this game as doing the books anyways…just in a parallels. for example throwing the balrog into moria was obviously the khazad dum chapter, i assume we'll defend minas tirith and gondor in the next cycle which is obviously the early return of the king

all these are the books, just not the linear storyline. so we shall see the rings likely, and we shall see the one ring, it just may not be in the book's cycle, so this brings me back to my initial point- doing the books direct is not really needed.

About this, yes, I've thought that too, that's why I think the fact that we're seeing many places and little stories is a good thing to make the game last longer instead of just the novels and then pretty much nothing of importance. I've also thought that between this game and A Game of Thrones lcg, storywise it would be more appropiate if they had "changed" systems. I'll explain. While we see little stories and adventures in Lotr lcg and following a strict timeline, in AGOT lcg we have a vague take on the storyline, seeing the main story in broad terms but often returning to random minor plots in previous books and having "earlier" versions of characters in the new sets and returning characters that were dead, etc. A general, more free take on the story, which I think would fit Lotr better. While on the other hand, Lotr lcg's chapter-driven and episodic nature fits the ASOIAF novels better. Just a thought.

And I envy you. I wish I could see the game the same as you. Feeling, for example, HoN as early ROTK or Khazad Dum as the Moria chapter. Before seeing the Nazgul in the Shire, or Frodo in Bree and then in Rivendell, or the events of TTT, I could not feel like that about those sets.

maybe they'll save the Saga expansions to coincide with when the hobbit movies come out.

there's supposed to be 3 movies now, and both boxes of their first saga expansion (the hobbit) will come out in time for the first one. maybe we'll get another 2 boxes when the next one comes out next christmas (fellowship of the ring?), and another 2 the year after that (two towers?) then they can wrap the game up with the final installment the following christmas. that would be nearly 5 years after they launched it, which might be the limit

perhaps- i think we shall certainly see something each time jackson releases a movie, if for nothing more than to boost sales

however i still do not think this method solves all of the problem i state in my above post….once they start with the fellowship theyve basically sent themselves on a path to end the game in a very controlled manner….maybe thats what they want, i dont know…but once 5 years is here and we have the end of return of the king, players will probably lose interest as it will feel a little anti-climatic to have anything else…..

 

i guess this could easily be solved by not releasing them regularly….they just say heres the fellowship book 1 + book 2 in 6 months time….and then leave the two towers for a date when they feel is right and then maybe commit to the return of the king when they need a desperate last boost

I think that this applies only to the end of the return of the king, rather than to the beginning of fellowship. They don't have to do them one after the other. They can make, say, first half of fellowship, then something else, then second half, then a Rhoann cycle or whatever, and finally finish with the retunr of the king.

One thing allways is how long time they have the license! The ending of the license has ended many LOTR cards games before "natural" end. How fun would it be to have 4/18 part of the LOTR saga ready and then end the production? Smaller sets don't cause so much bad feeling I think…

I already have the Decipher TCG for Frodo's journey.  I don't need/want this game to retread that path.

I'd much rather have this game for The Hobbit, the time between the Hobbit and the time Frodo left the Shire, and for other adventures that happened during the Lord of the Rings that were not part of the "ringbound" journey of Frodo.  For example, the Battle of Mirkwood, the Battle of Dale, etc.

I'm exactly the same, here. In this sense, I don't feel a need to have the actual book done as a series of saga expansions, it's sometimes more fun to say "well, that's how Frodo and Sam dealt with the orcs in Mordor - how would Aragorn and Glorfindel do?" or whatever. Having the same situations that you can play with different characters makes this a very RPG-y card game, it has an epic feel to it that I really like.

But I do feel that the introduction of Saga Expansions is leaving the door open for them to do the book. I doubt they'll have so much fanfare for just two deluxe boxes and leave it at that. Unless they present the book as an Epic Expansion, something proportionate to the core set, though weighted towards the encounter decks than player decks. Say, six quests with eighteen encounter sets or something, giving us a set chunk of the book. These days, I just think anything's possible…

Maybe one day comes a deluxe expansion for the three books made up like the miskatonic expansion for arkham horror, recycling the old encounter cards for saga quests.
