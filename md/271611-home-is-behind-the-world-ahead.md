Well at least it's news of the physical card game.

God that 4p map looks amazing... Even for solo play, plenty of room to take over the table for those more complicated quests that require more real estate. I'm looking at you, Blood of Gondor.

Not a fan of them reprinting the Fellowship event mats. Being part of the event made them feel special. I guess they will start reprinting the championship mats for their other LCGs? Just without the "Champion" written on it?

 

I do really dig The Hobbit mat though. I will definitely have to grab that one!

These will look great while playing Middle Earth CCG

I have to agree with this one.  I'm glad they made a big mat, but it does take away from the "specialness" of the Fellowship mat.

Haha honestly don't care if my mat is exclusive or not.  Go ahead and re-print fellowship mats, if you ask me.

BUT I suspect they will remove the words "Fellowship event" from each of the re-printed mats.  Check your existing mat, it says Fellowship event + date on there.  The new ones may not (and from the images, they don't).

Ordered my fellowship mat! Looks great and I play 2 handed.  Like it was tailor made for me.

Oh heck, I need that much space one handed.

The other 4 I'd like to hang on my wall

I wonder if I could make a wetsuit out of them...

Ooh, that big mat is cool, even though I already have the fellowship mat. The size of it is quite appealing. Minor annoyance: The encounter discard pile to the left of the encounter deck? Both Quest and Active to the right of that? And then finally the Active location to the right of the Quest?? What the... O_o I do the exact opposite for my setups haha (I do Active, Quest, Encounter Deck, Encounter Discard). I could do without the outlines mucking up the art. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

These make me want to play super bad. They look amazing! I’m also ok with reprints even if I had won one of these.

Couldn't care less any more. Game's dead.

That large mat is great, been wanting something like that for ages!

Finally! Thank you so much FFG!

I'm really excited for the four player staging area mat.

I do the same setup, except for the active being below the quest deck. It shouldn't be too hard to switch the places since there will be cards over the labels.

That awkward moment when you sit down 4-player and the other players use a different configuration than you do.

No more! Now it will be written right on the playmat where the cards go. It's the law.

I just decided to get into this game and ordered the core set yesterday.  These mats are just so beautiful they’ll have to an immediate addition (sorry wallet).

## 20 [FrogTrigger on March 19, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/271611-home-is-behind-the-world-ahead/?do=findComment&comment=3253895)

Yea I've got the core game and first cycle, great game lots of fun to play. I keep re playing the first cycle with new people and they have all loved it. It is a bit hard to find old product right now though. I like to play them in order, so I need to start hunting down and slowly building up the next cycle.

This four player mat is awesome though, great design. Why not do something like this sooner? Like, I know this game is popular but it has to be nearing the end of its life cycle for content. Unless they are planning something with the newly announced MiddleEarth based TV series?

My 4 player mat just arrived.

How big is it exactly?

## 23 [Bullroarer Took on March 20, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/271611-home-is-behind-the-world-ahead/?do=findComment&comment=3254614)

26" x 26".  It's not big enough for 4 players certainly and at least for me it would be awkward for two.  (But it's great for me as a solo!)

Is anyone thinking of pooling some orders to reduce shipment cost to Europe (even better to Belgium, Netherlands or Switzerland).
I like the mats but shipping in stuff from the US is usually not worth the cost unless the order goes over 100$.

@Bullroarer Took [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/171578-bullroarer-took/]

I think the intent of the four player mat is to host (along with the encounter deck/discard, quest deck, active location, and victory display/out of play/removed from game) the staging area. That's what the big unshaded map area is for.

I really like the White city playmat, but it is not in the news.

What white city playmat?

Any stores in Europe indicating they will be selling these?

The big mat is handsome, to be sure… (Though I may not be showing it off to its best effect here; thanks, Vilya. :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]) As I'm 2-handing, I'm staging off to the side on the 2017 Fellowship mat—it's nearly empty because this is the end of a Crossings of Poros win. The space depicting the Nine was rather conveniently sized to hold all those extra encounter sets that quest needs, by the way.
