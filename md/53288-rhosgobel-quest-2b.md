Rhosgobel Quest Card 2B has a forced effect about removing cards from the game if they heal Wilyador. Does this mean that if you used Radagast's or Glorfindel's effects they would be removed?

Yes. An explanation (based on the story behind the quest) has already been given here: http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=545693 [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=545693]

 This is correct. I just picked up this AP and haven't played it yet, but I would probably stay away from using Glorfindel's ability unless it was a dire need. As a neutral ally, Radagast will be much easier to replace. Also, Radagast can heal more than one wound at a time, which makes it a much better reward for the sacrifice of the card. Save up his resources and then play them at once. Keep in mind Wilyador can only be healed up to 5 wounds at a time.

Or get rid of Rhosgobel during stage 1 (*cough*NT*cough*) and do some healing during it.

Yeah :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] extremaly hard to pull off succesfully. While in theory seems easy, practice is little different. Damned location has 4 hit points and the clock is ticking so fast in this scenario...
