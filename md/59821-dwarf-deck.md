I know dwarf decks aren't quite there yet. Why is that? I tried one last night in hopes to have at least a fairly competitive one, but couldn't even beat Flies and spiders with it (got as far as b3 and a dead ungoliath, but couldnt finish the 10 quest counters). It took me multiple tries to get as far as I did.

What are dwarf decks missing? The deck I tried was 3 sphere, with Dain, Bifur, and Thalin. The idea was that Dain would be a defensive piece, Bifur was a low threat quester with a respectable +3 will, and Thalin helped soften the enemies and had a now +2 will. It didn't matter.  I got smashed. Despite getting a few dwarf allies out to help quest and fight, i just got overloaded fairly quickly.

If a pure dwarf deck is not currently possible, what would they need to get there? Does anyone have any dwarf heavy decks (not necessarily pure dwarf decks) that treat them well?

I love Dwarf decks, I've built a really solid solo deck and a paired set of 2 player decks that consistently beat the Khazad Dum quests.

Both use 1xCore + all APs

Here's a deck list [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/index.php?/topic/1712-lotr-deck-hirsute/] for the solo deck.

theyre still missing some goodish questers - they dont have any heros over 2 willpower. apart from that they are not bad, great fighting/defending, good resource mining- pun intended, healing can be got from other thematically neutral cards ie self preservation so yeah- questing

Bifur and Gloin quest for 3. I'm assuming nobody would ever consider making a dwarf deck without Dain, so that means all the others get +1 Willpower.

It's more than enough to sustain you in terms of questing power. Especialy if you factor in that most of your allies (if you take the Lore road with Longbeard Map-Maker, Eerebor Hammersmith and Erebor Records Keeper) are gonna be 2 Willpower for very low cost.

why not? plenty of theme reasons, or if you're running without leadership, given the hero choices im guessing people dont always include him
