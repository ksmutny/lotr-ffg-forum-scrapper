Hi all,

I have a couple of questions regarding the prisoner in the scenario "escape from Dol Guldur".

1) Can I attach a claimed objective card to the prisoner while he is still face down?

2) Can I attach "Caught in a web" to the prisoner while he is still face down?

3) Does the prisoner's threat cost count towards the party's starting total threat while he is still face down, or will it only be added to party's total threat once he is turned over?
 

Thanks a lot in advance for your help!

 

Regards,

 

Agesilaos

Hello, for 1 and 2, the answer is no. The captured hero is a non-entity until rescued, so you must proceed as though he/she isn't even there while in captivity.

For 3, yes, the threat will always count against you because threat level is determined in step 2 of the set up and quest cards are not flipped over (which is when the prisoner is determined) until step 7. Also, keep in mind that a hero's threat cost is only counted during set up, for the remainder of the game it is irrelevant and therefore could not be counted when the prisoner is freed.

HI Titan,

thanks for the prompt reply and the answers, much appreciated! I was hoping for some flexibilty, but I guess I will have to keep playing this scenario the hard way…

Its not an easy scenario! Are you playing single player? If so i believe it is one of the hardest! You may benefit from gettng some more adventure packs to broaden your card base for making a deck to beat this single player!

 If your playing multi-player, good luck! It is still tough but not insurmountable!

Yeah, this is not a quest that scales well for solo players. In co-op, losing one hero out of six or more isn't nearly as big a deal. In solo, one out of three is tough. You are essentially playing a secrecy deck without the benefits of the low threat. Still, I wish you luck!
