Just wondering if easy mode is really that easy? My buddy and I have been playing a Road Darkens in easy mode and we still can't beat it. It's all just disheartening and I feel like we are bad at this game.

Even easy mode in LotR is considerably harder than other co-op/solo games, and Road Darkens is not the friendliest point of entry for new players (I assume you've just started with this game?). Usually, each successive expansion has harder quests to account for the growing pool of player cards.  As for "bad at this game," you probably just didn't take enough time to learn the basics of strategy with just the Core Set before moving on to expansions, especially ones that are more veteran friendly.

We are not new to the game. I think we just don't play enough. Hoping to change that.

Even easy is not that easy indeed. Many quests have a kind of puzzle aspect where you have to find a right strategy and tune your deck to it.

 

There is also a blog series that (https://darklingdoor.wordpress.com/2018/05/17/path-less-traveled-the-road-darkens-player-cards/ [https://darklingdoor.wordpress.com/2018/05/17/path-less-traveled-the-road-darkens-player-cards/]) that does plays of boxes using only the core cards and the ones in that box. It has covered The Road Darkens.


In case you hadn't already, check out Beorn's path for a good introduction.

My wife and I were having a hard tim too, then we discovered Boromir and Eagles. That's been a life saver and allowed us to occasionally beat a scenerio.
