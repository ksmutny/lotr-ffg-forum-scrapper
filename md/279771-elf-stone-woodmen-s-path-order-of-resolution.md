Hi

I'm trying a scouting Party deck with Haldan, the New Woodman Character. (paired with Lanwyn and Cirdan with Fearless scout)

Until now it's pretty efficient in a two handed solo game with another Dale focused combat deck (Brand son of Bain / Bard son of Brand / Beregond Tactics)

I have a rule question, and i can't find the answer.

When playing on the same location a Elf Stone and the new attachement Woodmen 's Path which passive effect resolves first?

Elf Stone says : +1 quest Point to active location

Woodmen 's Path says : Quests Points are reduced to 1.

So which one activates first when the location becomes active location? Should I choose? That's not so easy, because both are passive effects on player attachement cards.

I 've played as the location gets only 1. (not adding the +1 from the Elf Stone, but I might be wrong)

And no grim rules with this game, it's already hard enough. ^^

Thanks for the help.

I don't know what would be actual ruling, but my gut feeling is that since Woodmen's Path reduces the total quest point value and not the printed one, it trumps Elf-stone.

I don't think it matter which order the passive efforts are applied, since Woodman's Path specifies a fixed value.  So if you do the path first

Path -- sets quest value to 1.

Stone -- adds 1, quest value to 2.

Path -- passive kicks in again, sets quest value to 1.

 

If you do Stone first:

Stone -- adds 1, quest value to X+1.

Path -- sets quest value to 1.

Stone's passive effect can only kick in once, or it would infinitely recur itself.

Is your Dale combat focused deck running Spirit or Tactics Brand?

I’d be interesting in seeing the decklist of your fellowship, pal!

regarding the rules I think @dalestephenson nailed it

Evidence for @dalestephenson [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/256741-dalestephenson/]'s interpretation can be found in RR Modifiers:



> If a value is “set” to a specific number, the set modifier overrides all non-set modifiers. If multiple set modifiers are in conflict, the most recently resolved set modifier takes precedence.



(Boldface added.) Technically, Woodman's Path "reduces" (not "sets"), but I think the same principle applies.

The "set" reasoning sounds right.  But also, the game does give you leeway to order responses and discards. So, maybe its the player's choice to set the ordering of these cards' effects (2 quest points or 1 quest point).

I’m pretty sure it’s reduced to one, since this is a passive, not a response or a forced.
