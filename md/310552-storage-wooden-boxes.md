Hello

I’m looking for wooden box(es) as storage. I found these two online:

1. https://www.laseredgames.com/?pid=1564&Antique_LCG_Case_Large_with_Tray_-_LoTR [https://www.laseredgames.com/?pid=1564&Antique_LCG_Case_Large_with_Tray_-_LoTR]

2. 



Does anybody has experience with one of these or know order wooden boxes?

Thanks in advance
