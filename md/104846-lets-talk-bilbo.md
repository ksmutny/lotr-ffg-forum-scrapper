Game designers evaluated his ability as most powerful ability of all time as they gave him 3 points of threat over his head - biggest threat cost penalty ever seen in the history of LotR LCG. 

 

But let's think about what we actually get for those 3 points of additional starting threat.

A whole 1 additional card each draw phase! Pretty good from the first glance, but... game can be played in multiplayer, you know.

So, basically, the thing currently are:

In 1 player game player gets 100% card draw boost from Bilbo;

In 2 player game, the potency of this boost is halved to 50%;

In 3 player game, it's shrinked to 33%;

And finally, in a 4 player game it's no more than 25% of a boost.

 

Not so shiny anymore. More of it, you can't even choose a player to prosper - it's tied to the first player token. Even worse, Bilbo is weakling of a character by himself and requires major work around him to get him running well... and for that you need a card draw, which becomes extremely spread the more players are in the game. 

 

So, my question is... were designers too harsh when they were giving him this much of a threat cost disadvantage? Could it be justified? What kind of a errata do you think could help him? Perhaps lovering his threat cost a bit? Tweaking his ability a little? Some minor stat boost?

 

I have a couple of ideas about him of my own. Most of them revolve around his ability.

Most liberal one is changing his text into:

"At the beginning of the resource phase, choose a player to draw 1 card."

 

That'll keep his approximately at the same power level, but will at least give the player some control over what's going on with his ability. And control gives birth to decision, which is fun in my humble opinion.

 

Whadda'ya think?

Good post....

 

My idea is:

 

Bilbo is similar than Gleowine:

 

Gl%C3%A9owine.png [http://hallofbeorn.com/Images/Cards/Core-Set/Gl%C3%A9owine.png]

 

But, the problem of Bilbo is only first player can draw, you can't chose who draws.

But, the advantatges are:

...free cost in start of game (no need 2 resources, neither need the card in hand); no need exhaust him to draw.

 

With these pros and contras, lets think:

- Bilbo only gives to you a 'peculiar' Gleowine?

 

Or better said: 3 threat points cost (the extra 3 threat points of Bilbo) are good for a 'direct card in hand' free with 2 cost? Let's see: Galadhrim Greeting cost 3 resources per -6 threat...

 

The-Galadhrim%27s-Greeting.png [http://hallofbeorn.com/Images/Cards/Core-Set/The-Galadhrim%27s-Greeting.png]

 

So 1'5 resources would be 3 threat.

 

We can think about the standard cost of 3 threat points are 1'5 resources.

 

Verdict: Bilbo's hability is better than normal ranking, because his cost is cheaper: you get for free an 'hability' with cost 2 rescoures (as Gleowine, even better: you have him in first hand automaticaly); the conditions is 'raise 3 threat'... but it is cheaper than Galadhrim Greeting, where decreasing 3 threat (the penalty of Bilbo) would cost only 1'5 resources, not 2 (the cost, remember, bilbo 'gives').

 

Said as other way: Bilbo gives you 2 resources by reasing 3 threat, while Greeting only gives you 1,5 res.

 

Bilbo then is 'cheaper'. Plus, i return to say, you 'have in first hand' this card you are wanting :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

Finally: there are 2 good reasons for chose Bilbo, the 0'5 resource you win (diference betwen Bilbo and Galadhrim Greeting), and the 'card in first hand you want'. It needs, then another penalty: who draws the card will be the first player (you can't chose).

 

Uf! Very deep knowledges!!! :rolleyes: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_rolleyes.gif]

The little pointy you're missing is that most of other heroes get their abilities for free. And there are more powerful effects at much lesser(or none) cost in existance, like Dain Ironfoot.

 

Lets list all of threat penalties existing to this day:

 

Beregond: +1 threat cost for being able to defend anyone with his bulking 4 defense and sparing you those 3 resources from Gondorian Shield and Spear of the Citadel. All at the cost of 1 threat.

 

Elladan+Elrohir: Both got +1 threat penalty, which is technically -1 threat bonus as they are meant to be played together and while paired, get stats worth of 1 over their threat cost + an awesome ability.

 

Elrond: +1 for being able to pay for ally of ANY sphere and increasing all heal effects, basically making Warden of Healing an overpowered sheet? For just +1 threat cost? And don't forget while it's not his printed ability - he is the only one who can work with Vilya.

 

Grima: +1 threat for being able to reduce any cost of any card of any sphere. Also triggers any doom-related effects, which will(I'm sure) grow in numbers as cycle progresses. Diminishes and shrinks in multiplayer, yes, but if all players build accordingly - will prove extremely useful. Technically +1 resource per turn, +2 if you got your keys of Orthanc out.

 

Hirluin the Fair: +1 threat for... do I even need to say anything about this hero? :lol: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_laugh.png]

 

Merry: Probably should't have listed this one, but just for the sake of it - he immediately gets his threat worth with his passive bonus just from him alone, and continues to grow with each other hobbit hero you brought along. He can even strike for pounding 4 if you're playing any of sagas. Oh, and he's also readies people.

 

Theoden: I listed Merry here, so for the sake of consistency, I'll list Theoden too here. Let's just say that he actually overworks his threat cost for each other Tactics hero in play, regardless of the player controlling him. Pairs extremely well with Merry, btw.

 

 

So, as a conclusion, I'll say: Bilbo's ability is EXTREMELY overpriced. EXTREMELY, by the terms of the own game he is taking part in.

I'm not sure who you were saying was missing the point, but I certainly wasn't. I believe he was meant to cost 6, which would have been "free" as you put it. Somewhere along the line a mistake was made and 9 was put on the card and it wasn't caught until too late.

All of your points are valid and they contribute to my belief that a printing mistake was made.

## 6 [Glaurung on April 26, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/104846-lets-talk-bilbo/?do=findComment&comment=1063023)

Bilbo is cool! He give you card or free! you don't need to do nothing! and with attachments he can also be a good defender and quester. I the time of core set and first cycle he was really ok. But now sure we have many cards to choose so he value is much less now. But what you want from old small hobbit?!  

## 7 [MyNeighbourTrololo on April 26, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/104846-lets-talk-bilbo/?do=findComment&comment=1063033)

I was obviously referring to Mndela who tried to justify the threat cost increase by comparing the costs of Galadrim's Greeting and Gleowine.

 

Glaurung, what I want from an old and small hobbit is a reasonable threat cost.

## 8 [Mndela on April 26, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/104846-lets-talk-bilbo/?do=findComment&comment=1063069)

He had got the unique ring very long time, so his +3 threat is reasonable ^^.

 

 

Joke.

 

Seriously, let's compare with Beravor:

 

in 2 rounds, Beravor draw one round and another she defends..., so she gets 2 cards and 2 defense points; Bilbo is same, or better! Bilbo draws 2 cards and 2 defense (twice! so 4 defense).

 

How about this approach?

## 9 [MyNeighbourTrololo on April 26, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/104846-lets-talk-bilbo/?do=findComment&comment=1063074)

OK, let's compare to Beravor:

 

Beravor gives the cards to the one you want, not specifically the first player.

Beravor is more efficient defender than Bilbo because she has more health. 

Beravor can also attack and quest reasonably, Bilbo can't.

By your pare Beravor with readying effect, she will give 2 cards and add her stats to something, or even apply her stats to something twice. All Bilbo can do from readying is defend additional time. Needless to repeat he is worthless at defending unless extremely buffed. Most enemies nowdays will kill him with 1 strike even without a shadowcard.

...and she is only above 1 threat over Bilbo.

 

Seriously, stop trying to justify his oversized threat cost.

## 10 [Bullroarer Took on April 26, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/104846-lets-talk-bilbo/?do=findComment&comment=1063076)

Bilbo was not old during the time frame in which this game was supposed to take place. The saga expansions are different.

## 11 [Mndela on April 26, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/104846-lets-talk-bilbo/?do=findComment&comment=1063217)

I prefer Gleowine than Beravor, Beravor gives to you 2 cards, and Gleowine gives to you only 1 card. Ok, but you dont lose a hero 1 turn.

And here is Bilbo: Bilbo gives to you a 'decent' (because you not chose the player, but no problem, all players need to draw :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]) Gleowine at first round, further: at setup.

Ok, you dont win each round a very 'super-hero' but better than nothing (Bera exhausted) of course it is.

 

PD: and you win 1 threat (Bera costs 10 threat; Bilbo only 9)

 

PD2: and atm hobbit trait has more advantatges (determination, short cut, pippin, hobbit sense, fast hitch...) than ranger or dunedain trait.

Bilbo gives 1 card to a first player. Beravor gives 2 cards to a player in need. You might not need Bilbo at all at some turns, so his precious 2 defense and health go to waste. Also damaging trecheries and effects, don't forget about them, Bilbo is very fragile, he's no Frodo.

 

Bilbo's card draw is decent only in single player. It becomes worthless the more players are in the game. I wouldn't call a 2 card boost to a needing player "nothing". Well-timed drawn right card could change the game. And it's more probable when you're drawing two cards from the needed deck than 1 card from deck of first player.

 

PD: You don't win anything, you lose 3 threat to his actual stats of combined 6.

 

PD2: As I said before - Bilbo needs a lot to work around him to become usable. This requires time and, once again, good draw, which he can't provide if there is multiple players in the game.

He was not old in terms of Hobbits  ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] .

 

I have never been a fan of the Bilbo card, to the point where I have never even used it before. In terms of a Lore hero with defense he is actually not that great compared to someone like Denethor who has more hp, defense, and less threat. Also to consider him for questing or attacking is sort of a joke I think. Maybe I would use him in a multiplayer game, oddly only for his diminishing ability though. I would never use him in a solo game. So on this one I have to agree with MyNeighbour, Bilbo would be more appealing if he had a lower threat.

## 14 [kyrie on April 27, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/104846-lets-talk-bilbo/?do=findComment&comment=1063613)

Bilbo is way over-costed. Should be 6 at the most. Unless they gave him different stats, as his 2 defense is wasted. Beravor is always better, unless playing a mono-lore mono-hobbit deck. They really messed up him, seeing how he was such a influential character in the books. Frodo is way more powerful than him, and he did not even have the ring at the time of the events of this game (in between hobbit and Lord of the Rings story). They should release a new Bilbo to replace this useless one.

 

I realize this is really negative, but I think this card is pretty bad (though not as bad as poor ole' spirit Pippin).

## 15 [monkeyrama on April 27, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/104846-lets-talk-bilbo/?do=findComment&comment=1063724)

In solo play Bilbo is very useful. The fact that his ability is passive, and he has a high-ish threat cost despite his weak stats means that he can be safely caught in webs or stirring up local trouble and you don't lose much punch while still gaining the card. If I remember correctly, he'll even gain the card when poisoned in the Hobbit spider quest since it's a passive effect. With only very minimal extra card draw you can keep a good engine going for a deck.

But in multiplayer, he is much less good. I've always viewed him as a solo game hero, much like Brand is pretty much multiplayer only.

## 16 [MyNeighbourTrololo on April 27, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/104846-lets-talk-bilbo/?do=findComment&comment=1063728)

Caught in the Webs does not requires a high threat hero, it requires a highest threat player to choose 1 of his heroes to attach CitW to.

 

Well, you can't use Bilbo in Flies and Spiders because there is a Baggins sphere Bilbo already.

If they released some attachment for him, like they did for faramir with the spoiled wingfoot, he'd still have a chance to get used in multi-player. Maybe his magic ring? He still had it at this time in the game.

How about it lowering your threat as you turn invisible or something?

Bilbo was a mistake I think. They meant for it to say 6 but no one caught on.

Ring attachment like:

 

Attach to a Bilbo hero.

 

Response: after Bilbo defenses one attack, exhaust 'Ring' to raise 1 threat and reduce enemy's attack to 0.

 

 

It could be good. Shadows arent cancelled, if not it would be over-powered.

I could see something like that possibly making Bilbo more appealing. But only having 3 copies of it per deck would be still little tough. Maybe along with the attachment there could be an event card that does something like "Action: Search your deck for a 'ring' attachment and add it to your hand. Then shuffle your deck." That way with 6 Bilbo "buff" cards you will have about a 12-13% chance to get at least one of them in your starting hand, compared to only about 6-7% with only 3 cards. Perhaps Bilbo would be less frowned upon if he got some sort of boost.

He is playable. He is good, I would say. But for someone as special as Bilbo, he should have been more. The ally version seems very, very good though. 2 willpower, 2 hp, bring a pipe, shuffling the deck (I especially value that option for some strategies), that is power!

Yes yes ally version look very good true. More options more different strategy and deck building. Sounds good anyway….

Just wanted to point out that the game technically takes place during the 17 years between Bilbo's party (when he leaves the ring to Frodo) and when Frodo finally sets out from the Shire. So Bilbo doesn't have the ring during this time period and Frodo does, which is why Frodo has the damage cancellation ability.

My own two cents: I do think he's over-costed. I don't think it was a printing mistake, but rather a mistake by designers when the game was still new.

That's true. I didn't think long before posting, just had the idea and went with it. Oh well.

Yet the suggestion stands: attachment for Bibi to make him worth his cost.

I think your analysis is a bit one sided. You claim that the card draw being split between multiple players reduces the effect - I assume on the grounds that in 2 player you only draw 3 cards instead of 4. However you disregard the fact that in multiplayer the threat cost for the ability is also relatively lower. (+3 threat cost for 1 player, a relative cost of +1.5 threat for 2 player).

The two players can more easily benefit from the free card draw without needing more supporting cards (resource acceleration primarily). The free card draw being passive is also not relatively worse - it's still +1 hero still available. Bilbo like all hobbits has poor stats it's true, but the hobbit trait is significantly more powerful now than it was when Bilbo card was created (then it was basically blank but his card draw ability was more unique in the card pool too).

Bilbo in a hobbit deck is a viable alternative to lore pippin to get you access to fast hitch, especially if you don't think you need the +3 to engagement costs (which isn't needed or relevant in a lot of quests).

 I also think you're heavily undervaluing the benefit of +1 card in your starting hand (when the start of the game is the most critical) even compared to Berevor who may help more (with a ready effect) but you need to draw it turn 1 for that effect.

I'm not convinced the ability is worth +3 threat (although I think Bilbo is easily playable with a 3 threat cost). if Bilbo was threat 6 he would probably be in every lore line up forever though, I can't believe that people in this thread seriously think that he should be 6.

The extra threat cost heros are mainly paying for additional benefits -

Grima and Beregond each cost 1 threat extra - and are paying for resource advantage.

Hirlon, Elladan and Elrohir pay for the potential for better stats at a cost of 1 extra. (These guys also have the penalty of getting worse if things start to go against the player).

Elrond pays 1 threat for having two abilities. (the second is pretty weak though)

Now to my mind Bilbo is paying 3 threat and gets: A passive ability, that always triggers every turn, and is always useful.

So I think 3 threat is perfectly fine actually.

If it was, it would have been errated in the faq... it's been 6 faq since then !

 

But between Spirit Glorfindel and Lore Glorfindel, time has passed. Bilbon was design in a time where player'ss card where not so overpowered (except for few ones that still need balance). Then, at a certain point, player's became more and more powerfull, ability became greater (and so does responsability :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] ) to a point where, sure, Bilbon became bad...

 

It is best to compare him with card that were printed around the same time.

You missed something : galadrim's greeting.

Yes, it's a card, and to play it, you need to draw it. So the cost for 3 threat should be 1,5 resources + 0,5 card draw.

With Lorien's Wealth, we know that 3 card draw cost 1 card and 3 ressource, so that 2 card draw = 3 ressource, so 3 threat should be 2,25 ressources.

 

He was more balanced than most of the hero at the time... he was in the standard, but then, the standard changed, and he became weak.

 

Should they rebalanced him and make errata and reprint ? If they do, there is a lot of cards that need this, so they may never do it in the begining...

Rapier, quoting system of this forum is horrible, so consider this post as a reply to yours:

 

And I think your's is. Yes, it does. Because it is comparable to the encounter deck. You play with 4 players - you face 4 times more threats. But Bilbo still provides 1 card, regardless, which is 4 times less relevant in a 4 player game. That's just as a bold example.

 

Not saying they can't benefit from it. Saying they will benefit from it much less than one player, while feeling the double pressure. 

 

Loppin is very strong, I don't think I would ever swap him for Bilbo, especially in a multiplayer game. I have a hobbit deck, featuring both Loppin and Bilbo though. Works well in solo. Would probably suck in mulitplayer.

 

And I think you heavily overvaluating it. This 1 card might be exactly what you need, but it might (and most probably - will) be nothing. I never actually felt that disadvantage of Gandalf's delay.

 

I, for one, never said he should be 6 threat. All I'm saying is 9 threat is too friggin much. Either increase his stats ot reduce it.

 

I've already listed my analysis of overpriced heroes earlies, so I won't be doing it again.

That depends on how good their design is - for example card draw becomes stronger as decks become stronger. So even though you might argue that heroes are getting more powerful (and apart form some Errant ones I don't think they are) Bilbo is still going to maintain strength because he can always help you to draw into the combo you wanted.

I like the thoughts of Rapier. It brings to me to compare Bilbo with Deep Knowledge (from last pack):

 

Deep-Knowledge.png [http://hallofbeorn.com/Images/Cards/Voice-of-Isengard/Deep-Knowledge.png]

 

We can see that 1 extra drawn card costs 1 threat (without thinking you need the card in hand that triggers it, so it costs more than 1 threat, but ok); so if normal costs for 1 card is 1 threat, and a normal game is more than 3 rounds... Bilbo is cheaper than in first sight it seems!

Why are you still trying to justify this by comparing it to the player cards? It does not works this way. 

Other heroes get their abilities for free or for minor increase, in rare cases even decrease, of threat.

I'm thinking, Bilbo is greater even in multiplayer. For lore sphere is easy other options for drawing..., but, for example, if another player is leadership monosphere? That player would love Bilbo in game... ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

 

At the moment, drawing hability is very cheap for lore, but for other spheres drawing effects are more expensive..., so Bilbo's hability is more important and cheaper than we can see in first sight.

And I think not. Example: Dain Ironfoot. Released same cycle as Bilbo. No threat penalty. EVERY FRIGGIN DWARF IN THE GAME GETS +1 ATTACK AND +1 WILLPOWER WHILE DAIN IS STANDING. Again, no threat penalty. Now, stop trying to justify Bilbo by comparing him to the player cards. No, seriously, stop.

Hability of Dain is different than hability of Bilbo.

 

In fact, the best hability in the game is the drawing cards. As you have more cards in hand, your game become better, you have more options to play. Dain is useless if no dwarfs in game, in hand. :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] . You never see Dain alone, he is a king, and he goes with dwarves armies.

Bilbo can be played in all decks. So Bilbo is better, is more versatil.

 

Return to first theme: drawing bonus is better than other bonus (+wp, +attack, etc). So drawing effects must be more expensive.

If you want to draw cards, you need cards that draw cards. If you dont have them? You need more drawing...lol.

Only heroes in play in setup can fix this problem. Atm are: Pippin Beravor Ori...., all of them needs conditions: Ori needs 5 dwarves in game, Beravor needs to be exhausted, Pippin engages enemy... Only Bilbo has no conditions (so it is just his threat cost).

 

The hability of drawing cards has no price. Is the best hability. All tactic players make his mulligan around foe-hammer; spirit players around mathom....well, almost all, but it is ok, isn't?

 

Even if you want an specific card, for example, Gleowine. You need Word of Command, and Gandalf in game. So you need 2 specific cards in game and 6 resources. Bilbo gives to you all in the same setup of game. No need combos neither tones of resources. So it is good than developers add other costs like +3 threat points and limited to first player.

 

PD: and Bilbo is the unique heroe that allows to draw for other players diferent than lore sphere (wll, only Beravor is in adittion, jeje)

Why are you calling abilities "habilities"? Is it some archaic british wording or something?

 

On the subject: Yes, it's different, because it's a lot better.

Cards are no use if you can't play them.

Well, arguement "dain is useless if there are no dwars" is equal to me saying: "bilbo is useless if I put cards that do not belong to sphere of my heroes into my deck". Bilbo is worse because he can't do what Dain can. In solo, if you're running 2 another dwarf heroes, it's +4 worth of stats, and +6 for each additional dwarf player. It's also increases with each dwarf ally.

Bilbo is not good in comparsion to Dain. Dain has monsters stats and monster ability. Bilbo has weak stats and subpar ability. 

No additional card you draw during your first resource phase thanks to Bilbo can bring the same effect of Dain just being there standing. Also, Dain is just 2 threat points over the Bilbo, lol.

Comparing any hero except Spirit Glorfindel to Dain Ironfoot you'll find the other hero comes up short. Dain Ironfoot is basically the best hero in the game, Glorfindel is a contender because of his stupidly low threat cost - depending on what you want these two heroes might be comparable or one would be better than the other.

No other hero even comes close. You shouldn't be using these two heroes as the basis for any hero to hero comparison because the conclusion is essentially - every hero is bad, or these two should be weaker. (Glorfindel should come in at 9 or 10 threat, Dain should do attack or willpower not both).

Mndela, are you using Bilbo more than spirit glorfindel ? or more than Lore Pippin ? and win ? 

 

If you want to compare him, compare him with Ori.

If you play Ori, you surely play with Bombur, and a third dwarf hero, and erebor record keeper.

Well, in 80% of game where I play Ori, I have my 5th dwarf turn 1, if not, turn 2.

So... Bilbon as +3 threat for 1 or 2 more card ? yeah... crappy.

 

I need to deckbuild dwarf ? well, you need to boost bilbo too.

 

I have played a lot of "tournament" and we never, ever, see bilbo more than once. (and that's like, 60 or more decks seen) (and it was me, testing him, and he died first turn against nightmare ungoliant spawn... Ori survived with the help of Dain)

Here we go again, us errata seekers, haha. I actually think Dain should only work on Dwarf allies (just like they "dwarved" Battle Master). You still have a very, very good hero but it is not so straightforward, you do not get the boost from the off.

Just to throw some effects into the mix that could be powered by having a "spare hero" as some seem to think Bilbo to be. These effects all have in common that they are cheap resource-wise and if you built your deck with the strategy in mind to use one of your heroes exclusively to power such effects, then you can take it a long way. I have used Bilbo like this myself with good success.

And you still get the free card draw. Granted, it is less usable the more players there are (which I have also stated in earlier posts). Though you can´t look at Bilbo and then primarily choose to discuss him from a 4-player perspective; the example with Brand has already been mentioned in that regard.

 

Though I would still argue that Bilbo can work perfectly fine with burning brand and a bit of defense boost to take some enemy attacks as well.

Many heroes can be boosted to perform different spectacular things. Gimli, as an example, given right boost can kill most worthy foes with 1 hit alone. Oh, and if you happen to have heavy stroke in your hand...

 

That's not the point. Thread is not about how bad Bilbo is, it's about how bad he is for the amount of threat he brings compared to other heroes.

## 51 [Glowwyrm on April 28, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/104846-lets-talk-bilbo/?do=findComment&comment=1064994)

Bilbo is great!  A little over-costed, but I still play him, especially in multi-player games.  I think Bilbo is much worse in solo, when you can't afford a high-threat low stat hero, even if he's netting you some extra cards (though I have run him alongside Leadermir and Denethor for a solid Gondor swarm deck).  In multi-player, I can run a mono-Lore deck (my favorite is Bilbo, Pippin and Mirlonde) that starts at a low threat (allowing me to get a Resourceful down first turn) and runs support for the rest of the team (card draw, healing, trapping, ranger bowing etc.).  One of my goals in running mono-Lore in multi-player is to pass card draw around to all the other players at the table, because the ability to provide card advantage for your team is valuable, especially for the Tactics player.  Biblo makes this easy to do.  While Beravor is also good, Biblo being a hobbit opens up a nice synergy with Lore Pippin.  And with a burning Brand and Protector of Lorien, he becomes a credible defender.  And, if you're really dedicated to helping the team, you could run Bilbo and Beravor (which I will try some time).

And maybe Bilbo is not "better" than Dain, per se, but I find him a lot more interesting to use and he can be a valuable part of multi-player strategy.

But, the whole point of this thread is "do I wish Bilbo had a lower threat cost?"  I would say yes, and 7 or even 8 would be appropriate.  I still play him as is though.

But you're basically taking arguably the best hero in the game - who is clearly broken and on a different level of power from almost every other hero (bar 1). This is just a terrible thing to do in terms of your argument as it makes it look weaker.

Every hero except one looks crap compared to Dain.

> Bilbo is cool! He give you card or free! you don't need to do nothing! and with attachments he can also be a good defender and quester. I the time of core set and first cycle he was really ok. But now sure we have many cards to choose so he value is much less now. But what you want from old small hobbit?!  

This. All you need is Arwen or Protector of Lorien (that card makes him a beast in solo mode!) and Burning Brand plus some Fast Hitchs. With these new high attack enemies he is not that good anymore, ok, but there's still Hobbit Cloak to give Bilbo some additional DEF. There was a time however, when Bilbo was one of the best. In early game, he's ok. In end mid and endgame, he simply rocks the boat.

 

I'm glad that Bilbo exists. He's one of the few heroes that favour solo players.. A lot of my best results were gained with Bilbo.

No he doesn't. Dain is too good. This means that Dain is either undercosted (he could be threat 13 or 14 easily and still get played) or his ability is just too good to balance against the other heroes (which is my opinion).

Bilbo looks bad compared to Dain sure. So does Loreagon, As do all the other global boost heroes (Celebron, Boromir, Theodred). Basically everyone looks bad compared to Dain - so saying that Bilbo does too just doesn't prove anything except to bring your balance judgement into question.

You haven't responded to my argument that paying extra threat is usually for small benefits or large benefits with associated costs.

Bilbo is one of the only heroes in the game who can be hit by a cannot ready/exhaust affect and still help you because his ability is passive. 

Bilbo guarantees you access to his stats and the card draw unlike the only other hero that can guarantee card draw, Berevor. Now Berevor has better stats, 1 extra willpower, 1 extra attack and 2 extra hit points - for 1 extra threat. However Berevor can only give you 2 cards or 2 willpower, bilbo can give you 1 card and 1 willpower. As a defender (which is what Bilbo is best at) Bilbo can give you 1 card and 2 defence compared to 2 cards or 2 defence.

Also while Bilbo's card draw is no longer as good as it was (we have access to more card draw abilities than we used too) having the hobbit trait is better than ever. Bilbo can be targeted by 3 fast hitches, 2 ringmails,  boots of erebor, one hobbit cloak, a burning brand, bill the pony and help to power take no notice and receive halfling determination x3.

This extreme combo would give BIlbo 4 actions + 1 card a turn, 6 hitpoints, 4 defence vs enemies with a lower engagement than his threat and 6 vs enemies with a higher one, he could ignore all shadow cards and potentially have 12 defence, 7 attack and 7 wilpower.

Now yes, that requires you to put a lot of effort into bilbo (although in a hobbit deck that was red/purple/green you would probably run all those cards), realistically you wouldn't put all the fast hitches on bilbo or use the halfling derminations in one go like that. However as a defender you may well give bilbo all the other cards.

 You just can't get Berevor anywhere near that good - the hobbit trait is just better than the ranger one currently.

But really Bilbo's ability being completely passive - it doesn't even require an action window. If Bilbo is on the table you get the card - it's not possible to stop it, is so good. 

Maybe I could see him being threat 8 instead - anything lower than that and Bilbo would just be an auto-include. I think he still has a lot of advantages that justify threat 9 instead. I've never felt that bilbo wasn't pulling his weight.

Hey, you cannot argue against game experience. You could hand me a confession of Bilbo telling me how awful he truly is, but as I have played him, played him multiple times, I know what he is capable of.  I'm not sure how useful Bilbo is in multiplayer, as I'm only playing him solo. But for us loners he's one of the best. He simply synergizes perfectly with his own sphere.

Your point is that Bilbo should cost less threat because his ability is not worth it's cost, I think.

I think if Bilbo cost less threat he would be relatively too good.

I have advanced several arguments to examine Bilbo's power compared to other cards.

However ultimately we're all only providing evidence from play. You're basically arguing that you'd never play bilbo in multiplayer where you find him too weak - although I think you're doing a terrible job of arguing for your point because I think you're off topic too much.

For instance you basically argue that Bilbo is weak in multiplayer because of his ability ties to the first player token, but you didn't explain how you would change his threat in relation to this - only that it should be changed.

I mean I'm not clear on whether you think if your proposed change of (Bilbo's controller choosers a player) would then mean the ability was worth its 3 threat cost?

If you are arguing that then you must accept that in solo play his ability is worth 3 extra threat?

if you're not arguing that then is your point that it's not possible for this ability to be worth 3 threat? (i.e. one card a turn would never be worth that cost).

I would argue that a targeted +1 card a turn as a passive effect would be too good in two player, but maybe in 4 player it would help to keep bilbo more relevant. However I think that balancing him at 2 is more important than at 4.

Also the absolutely strongest argument for Bilbo being a weak hero is the value of his new ally card - in much the same way that Faramir's ally is very strong so it's hard to justify his hero (increasingly hard in more players where you can guarantee someone running faramir ally). This is a problem for all heroes that also have good ally cards though.

You could hand me a confession of Bilbo telling me how awful he truly is, but as I have played him, played him multiple times, I know what he is capable of.  I'm not sure how useful Bilbo is in multiplayer, as I'm only playing him solo. But for us loners he's one of the best. He simply synergizes perfectly with his own sphere.

Hmmmh, you point was that Bilbo's threat should be lowered. I think I got that. My point is that he is perfectly ok for solo play. Your first post has been reasonable, but there were certain points I disagree with:

 

- it's not diffcult to boost Bilbo's stats; his ability helps to get the cards that you need

- you completely ignored his Hobbit trait and his sphere

- you based your critics on a 3-4 player game, which should never be the basis to balance a card in general

- you ignore there are cards that specifically reward a large number of players, so it's perfectly ok to have at least some cards that favour a small number

-other heroes are not that hard to boost, it's not the reason to boost starting threat by 3;

-no trait in history has granted anybody a 3 threat overcharge;

-the cards in general should try to maintain balance between all numbers of players;

-and again, that's an extremely bad excuse for the starting threat overcharge of that size.

More Trololol Trolling, excellent thread read.

 

I play Bilbo I enjoy his ability in 1 and 2 player.

The question is not : "is he worth playing ?" Of course he is worth playing ! Depending on the cards, you want to play, and what you are expecting from the game.

 

The real question is : "is he better, even or worst compare to other heros ?"

And here, we are starting to compare apples to carrots. But let's try :

 

My only point of comparison is the uniqueness of his ability : Bilbo ability (eg drawing) is quite common especially in Lore sphere. You can obtain quite similar effect (Gleowyn) through cards you are playing. Nothing comparable to Aragorn (Lo) or Grima who provide such unique ability in their sphere. I would have personnaly much better understood a big gap between stats and threat cost for this 2 Heros.

I love that old fart and he is usually splashed into my deck when I need green playing solo or two handed

 

The biggest challenge now is just deciding what to do about that awesome doppelganger

Though you do not start with Gleowine on the table; you need to draw him first and then he costs 2 resources to play.

Bilbo is ready to contribute from round 1, giving you an edge from the get-go.

What I would like to see with old Bilbo is a scaling mechanic, for instance: "Reduce Bilbo's starting threat by 1 for each other player."  That way he would maintain his (I believe) justified cost in solo but become more appealing in multiplayer (specifically 3 or 4 player, where you get less out of his ability).

This may be a very good suggestion for an errata. Although I think it should be -1 threat for the 3rd player and -2 threat for the 4th. It might be neater to just say -1 threat per additional player. 

I find that Bilbo is completely playable in 2 player but I can see how he is less appealing at 4. (although that said in 4 player you're guaranteed to have threat reduction so I suppose it won't be as bad if he has 3 extra threat - but that argument does apply to any heroes).

> Have I said somewhere that he is unplayable?

First, this was a showcase of pure excitement after getting my ass whipped by this scenario with dozens of decks.

 

Second: well, you said that his ability isn't worth 3 points of additional threat:

 

> So, my question is... were designers too harsh when they were giving him this much of a threat cost disadvantage? Could it be justified? What kind of a errata do you think could help him? Perhaps lovering his threat cost a bit? Tweaking his ability a little? Some minor stat boost?

>  

Answer: it is worth it, there is no neeed for an errata, because he's already one of the strongest heroes. At least for solo play. Not that i don't like your idea of choosing the player who is going to receive a card.That's cool, but that doesn't justify an errata.

## 78 [MyNeighbourTrololo on May 5, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/104846-lets-talk-bilbo/?do=findComment&comment=1072628)

In the environment, where most heroes don't pay threat cost for their abilities, and those who do - pay minor cost, his ability is totally not worth it, gives the loss of scaling in the multiplayer, period.

Leaving his usability (or lack thereof) aside, his threat should in any case be lower for thematic reasons. He is a hobbit after all, therefore he should be fit for secrecy and sneaky low threat decks.

Could not also the thematic argument be made that since Bilbo is the most famous of hobbits (maybe aside from Bullroarer Took; but he is long dead) he would naturally draw more attention to any endeavor he dedicates his time to?

For thematic reasons Hobbits should be immune to Local Trouble...

In most of the cases - they are, thanks to abnormally low threat.

I like playing Bilbo in 1 & 2 player games. I don't play him in 3 & 4 player games. I think he should be -1 threat per extra player at the table to balance him out.

As a predominantly solo player I love Bilbo. I used to play him exclusively in my most powerful deck until more heroes were produced.
