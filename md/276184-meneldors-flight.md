MENELDOR'S FLIGHT ALLOWS TO "CHOOSE AN EAGLE ALLY. RETURN THAT CHARACTER TO ITS OWNER'S HAND."


IT DOES NOT STATE THAT THIS ALLY HAS TO BE IN THE GAME. DOES THIS MEAN THAT I CAN RETURN AN EAGLE ALLY FROM THE DISCARD PILE?

From the Rulebook, page 25:

Cards in your discard pile are considered to be "out of play" and so cannot be the target of Meneldor's Flight.

Cards in general only affect other cards in play unless the card specifically says it can.

It works well with Gandlaf paid full price before he is discarded.

That’s Borne Aloft. Meneldor’s Flight only works on eagles.

Oops... You're right! ?
