 Just wondering what people think the chances are of seeing a new version of Legolas in the second Hobbit set? I know he's not in the book, but I wonder if FFG will want to capitalise on the interest in the upcoming film? He's a very popular character after all. I think it's a double edged sword. It would be cool, and it makes perfect sense for him to be there, but I think purists might be disappointed in FFG pandering to the Movies. I am a purist, personally, but I also think more players and interest in the game can only be a good thing.

I assume they'll be a Mirkwood quest, and I know the Elves, while not enemies per se, are a hindrance to the dwarves at this stage. (A Legolas enemy?!) But during the Battle of Five Armies it would be good to be able to represent each race participating. Or is Thuranduil a better choice?

im a pureist and would personally burn my collection if ffg did that…..ok thats a lie (and a big one at that!!), but i hope not. i can see (and appreciate) ffg capitalising on the movies, and despite being dissapointed when they release the news months ago, i have come to see just what a great business move it is, which of course makes the game grow and keeps it going for us

placing in legolas has no such merits…

i should probaby note i really doubt this happenning anyways- the designers have alot of respect for tolkien lore which i respect and admire them for…..so i think they will stick to the characters actually present in the books

PS- i was so relieved when i saw the dwarves were REAL dwarves in the art from the hobbit cards…..sigh of relief…..

no chance at all, esp if this release is a marketing move to entice new players -- they have to buy the core set to play anyway, which would then be two legolas'.

anywho, FFG does not have the movie license and has to make an effort to differentiate their product -- that's (legal) reason enough to not have anyone not in the book.

Legolas wouldn't be that out of place, seeing as the dwarves and bilbo did stay in his kingdom for a few weeks. Sure he's not mentioned by name, but that doesn't mean he wasn't there. To add to that, we know that jackson is going to have him present in the movie. While FFG isn't representing the film, I don't think it would be unreasonable that they might try and hook new players in by using its popularity. I don't know if you can remember when the trilogy was in the theaters… but Legolas was the a fan favorite, and I think that from a marketing place, its perfectly possible that they might include him.

That being said, I'd prefer not to have him, as I feel like he doesn't particularly need another representation. Much rather get Balin, Thranduil, Bard, Maybe a new bilbo.

I rather thought the scenario we'll be seeing for the Mirkwood bit of the novel would be the escape from the elven king's halls, which, to my mind, would make Thranduil and Legolas, et al, enemies. Which I think could be a really interesting idea for the game, but who am I to say :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

So long as we don't get this Tauriel character…

Unless you have a problem with blonde Silvan elves (or Orlando Bloom). But yes I will acknowledge that for many, Leg's was the favorite. Even so, I think all of the members of the fellowship had their share of being favorites (possible exception of Boromir, who I think was unjustly portrayed as a total ass in the theatrical release, the extended cuts slightly made up for this but how many non-diehards have seen those?).

I didnt feel like they were THAT far off with Boromir, but they really screwed up on Faramir.  The changes to his character for the movie made no sense whatsoever and for people that have not read the books, ruined a great character.

i think they screwed legolas up beyond repair- they made him (and just about all elves) into some sort of ninja race

 The reason I wondered about Legolas was if they do four heros again, who would they be? Bard and Thranduil?

Does anyone know what will happen when they release a Balin character? Will he be banned from playing the Khazad-dum expansion? It would be pretty weird if he went to Moria to investigate his own death.

Well there are still two dwarves left, Balin and Oin (if i remember right) plus they might do Bard as a hero.  Those are my three guesses, as for the 4th it would probably be either made up or a revamped character.

The movie did all kinds of things that didn't make sense…Faramir was turned into a wimp, Denethor was turned into a crazed madman.  By the time Gandalf arrived to town, the beacons were already lit and there were no ill-will between Gondor and Rohan and the movie totally fabricated this gloom and doom and "there's no point" to the character.   Also, the elves never showed up at Helm's deep to help Rohan defend themselves….there are just crazy things like that which leave you scratching your head.

I like this idea. On a tangential topic, do we think that both Balin and Oin will be heroes? We had several of the dwarfs as allies in TH I, maybe we have the remaining two as allies in TH II. I would think that with the Battle ot 5 Armies we would have more of those "non-dwarf" characters, like Lord ot Eagles, Thranduil (even though we escape Mirkwood probably in quest 1 or 2), and Bard.

I also don't think that we'll get another Bilbo, as I expect the one from TH I will be a continue to be a mandatory "joint-hero" (if you'll permit the term) in TH II.

It looks like there is the artwork for it. It was posted a while back here:

yes that was spoiled very early on in the game for some reason- thorin was even shown on an early spoiler poster before the game came out (or early afterwards)….bit strange really

Thanks for that impaulm, I hadn't seen it. I like it, although I wish the light had been coming from the front rather than in the background (maybe a more majestic looking Gwaihir?), but I'm no artist (at least in the sense of the visual arts).

Team Covenant has a banner image up from an earlier stage in card development showing him.

It is really cool to see what was changed. Thorin's ability is related to Gloin's in a way. Legolas has totally different art (Good change!) and Gandalf is more costly but quite different in one power (Balrog would be insta-dead) . Threat levels are different too.

yeah its really interesting seeing the change- theres another one that has a few locations and enemies that are different……

the rules supplement explicitly states: "The new version of Bilbo Baggins cannot be used as a hero when playing any scenario from a product other than The Hobbit: Over Hill and Under Hill.

if taken literally, this means he can't be used in The Hobbit II and we'll get a new version.

Yeah, I just noticed that too. I hope it won't be similar to the two Arwen objectives from the start of the Dwarrowdelf cycle, and we'll get a different new Bilbo.

i must have missed something… are you saying that Legolas is in the new hobbit movie?

My mistake, I actually don't have TH I yet so I haven't read the rules, just what I've seen on the boards

Yes, I think that PJ confirmed at some moment that Orlando Bloom will recast for the Hobbit movie. And also PJ has made up a new female elf main character for the movie (the second one I suppose), Tauriel, played by Evangeline Lilly, from Lost. I think Galadriel makes an appearance too.

The white council is alluded to in the book. The film will actually portray those scenes, so yes Galadriel and Saruman will return. The film will also cover other scenes not explicitly explored in the book, for example the dwarves of erebor, and the vanishing of the necromancer from Dol Guldur. And yes, legolas is set to return.

yes as kcall07 states, the white council is mentioned but never 'scened out' in the flesh……same with alot of cinematic things that jackson will add in. i guess the point is that the hobbit is much more lighthearted than the trilogy, so he needs (needs?? nah….wants to) inject some 'action'

this is why ive always said the hobbit doesnt transfer well to film, and the reason i wont be going to see it gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]

Keep in mind too, that since The Hobbit is actually going to be in 3 movies, PJ has already confirmed that he is adding in stuff from appendacies that are going on at around the same time (really wishing for the Necromancer and his tower and the white councel throwing him out!).  So there will be a lot of people in the 3 hobbit movies that are not part of the main Bilbo storyline.

the biggest problem with farimire in the film is that it completely guts one of the major ideological messages of the entire book series.. it was a travesty how they handled him about on par of the re-write of the fate of Saraman
