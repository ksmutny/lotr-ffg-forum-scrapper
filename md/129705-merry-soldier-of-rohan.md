what would you guys think of an attatchment card that let merry change his ability so where it says hobbit it now becomes hobbit or rohan? with maybe a similar thing for pippin and gondor?

If you had it change from hobbit to Rohan but he remained hobbit (So he loses 1 attack for the versatility of working better with Rohan heroes) I could see that being okay (You could use Nor am I a stranger to give Merry the Rohan trait too).

I think I'd probably prefer an entirely separate version designed to work with Rohan though.

Same deal with Pippin really. I think the change would be okay, and steward would be able to bring him back to the same power level. However again, a seperate Gondor themed version may be better.

Or maybe this is a nicer way of showing their evolution. (I'm not sure a 3rd Pippin is really called for). 

These cards if they're coming, are most likely to be in the saga expansions (also where we may see the Rohan and Gondor hero versions).

I think we'll get new hero versions rather than title attachments.

The problem would be that you'd need to draw into these cards so you'd not have it "from the start".

Unless they design a new card mechanic for it. (Attach to Merry, Merry gains the Rohan trait, Merry gains +1 attack for each hero with the Rohan trait. Merry does not generate a resource in the first turn of the game).

But I think it's too strong this way - or well, maybe not since it's basically trading a resource just to make Merry the same as he usually is but with a different trait. But it hurts nor am I a stranger to do this.

It's gonna be a new version for each. A "setup attachment" that gives an ability is overpowered since you'd have the hero's ability plus the attachment from the start. They might as well make a new version with tht ability, and hopefully in another sphere (Pippin Leadership, Merry Spirit).

Except this setup attachment costs you 1 resource to replace an ability, not to get a new one.

I too think we're more likely to get all new heroes though.

Agree setup attachments would be overpowered. Would love to see a spirit version of Merry with his ability revolving around Rohan plus a Leadership Pippen with Gondor.

Something like a "Horn of the Riddermark" attachment that can be played on Rohan and Hobbit heroes would be a nice thematic way to 'Rohan' up Merry. Gives the hero the Rohan trait and exhaust to give some kind of bonus when engaging or attacking enemies with a higher engagement than your threat?

We might just see a couple of boons in the saga quests that attach to hobbitses.

I hope not. I want to be able to use Rohan and Gondor Hobbits in other quests too.

 

I also don't want new versions that are identical but in a different sphere with different traits and the same rules. I doubt very much that's the route that will be taken by the designers too.

I like the idea of setup attachments, I'll give them some more thought. I agree that 1 resource is insufficient to balance them.

I just think that they will be released as an alt version heroes someday.

I'm not sure if I would play Pippin. He has a reactive ability that only works after a hero takes damage, but why would I want to ready him? So I can attack for 1? And also, 1 resource in mono leadership is next to useless. He is inferior IMO to his Lore version, but could work OK in a multisphere deck.

He's Gondor. He's Hobbit. He's Warrior. Wink-wink. Also, multiplayer'n'low threat.

## 16 [gandalfDK on December 24, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/129705-merry-soldier-of-rohan/?do=findComment&comment=1379430)

This Pippin is weak. Draw a card instead of resource wouls be better imo although that doesn't theme witht the Gondir trait.

What if?

That is extremely playable. Maybe even OP. I'd love if it was real.

The second version is actually very nice. I'd use that. Merry for Steward of Gondor!

You shouldn't listen to these powermongers. The first version was fine as it was.

With stuff like "Hobbit-Cloak", that core event that let´s you ready a hero for exhausting another, "Peace, and Thought" etc there are still many options available to a seemingly weak hero. Plus the low threat is also good.

Hobbit Cloak + Gondorian Shield.

The first version was plenty powerful. The ability to gain extra resouces on a character with the Gondor trait opens that character up to Gondorian Fire and Blood of Numenor, which would also make the readying more useful.

It is fun to see how one of the best and more reliable ways to use the first version of Pippin is a Rohan hero (Erkenbrand) instead of a Gondor one.
