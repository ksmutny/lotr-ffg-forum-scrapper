Could someone explain how this works please,you exhaust a character to commit to the hide test when you have passed etc it says you are no longer committed to the test does this mean you un exhaust your character or do they stay exhausted for the whole turn much like questing etc.

you only ready if a card allows you to (i.e. unexpected courage) or during the refresh phase.

 

so, in short, yes, anyone you committed to the test stays exhausted. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

It just means, they aren't commited to the hide test anymore. So if you make another hide test in the same round/phase, you must commit new characters. The old ones don't count their willpower anymore.

I was under the impression the characters you selected for a hide test in-exhausted after the test as well. Thanks for clarifying!

Yes thanks for clearing that up,i was actually playing it like that keeping them exhausted but was finding it very hard so wondered if i was doing it right,ive only the core set and black riders so i suppose that makes it even harder.

thanks
