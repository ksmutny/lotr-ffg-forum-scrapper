1.) Will a sneak attack Gandalf return to my hand before paying a visit to the graveyard?

2.) Can I exhaust attachments and allies the turn they come into play?

thank you

1) He returns to your hand. When played with Sneak Attack, he is only out there for a phase as opposed to the entire turn, so Sneak Attack resolves before Gandalf's own ability does. Timing with Sneak Attack is very important because you must choose what you want to do with Gandalf, i.e. quest, attack,defend.

2) I always play it that they can be exhausted immediately upon coming into play. The chart at the back of the book shows the planning phase(where you would play most allies and all attachments) as green ,meaning actions can be taken at that time. So, in my interpretation, let's say you play Steward of Gondor on a character, it's effect is an action, so you can immediately exhaust it for it's resources while still in the planning phase. If the exhausting were done as a response, it would be different because then you would have to wait on it's trigger to exhaust it.

Both of the above posters are correct :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

The following link might provide some useful examples of how some of the more complex effects of cards in the game can, or cannot, interact:

Sneak attack + Gandalf seems like an insanely powerful combo cool.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/cool.gif]

I wonder if there's going to be some errata on this in the future.

I wonder if there's going to be some errata from Frodo cause with only 7 threat cost Frodo is way too good.Frodo can save you from the troll even if you have 0 cards in your hand and only your 3 heroes in play.

As for Gandalf don't forget that if he dies(it sounds like a joke but if you use him to block the troll despair's shadow effect can realy do that) you don't get him in your hand if you used sneak attack.

At the cost of 6 threat, strong but there is a counter part.

It's like each time you use Frodo's ability you increase his cost by the correct amount of threat.

Actually many heroes are strong and we can tell all are strong if played in a deck that use their abilities.

 yeah... currently, sneak attack and stand and fight work so well with gandalf... you can actually use him up to 6 times in a game... or even 9 times if you have a leadership spirit deck... hmmm maybe one to try out? i.e. 45 threat points less, or 36 damage to any monster... + his questing/fighting ability... I wonder if ever in this game they will make another powerful character like him... 

 

maybe RING A DING DILLO, TOM BOMBADILLO!!!!!!!!!!!! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] I just love that guy...

Frodo+Galadrim greetings is a very strong combo.Threat is not a promblem for spirit spherelengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif].

I was playing a game with my buddy (Nerdcore on the forums) and this is what won the game for us. Popping Gandalf in 2 phases in a row because I'm holding 2 of those is a lot of fun.

I have Leadership Spirit deck as well. Sneak Attack is the card I always look to get. And I wish there be a card in the future that would pull it from the discard pile (other than Will of the West).

I generally prefer my proxies to be in english so I haven't given Frodo a try yet.

When thinking about him I noticed one cool thing. Frodo makes undefended attacks less lethal. If Dol Guldur Orcs pops up as a shadow effect you just raise your threat by an additional three instead of watching a hero die.

Yes, choose your words wisely, else a hobbit will stab you from behind, on your knee. It took two people to kill him, but only one attacked from the rear.

 Well, when compared to the real tough guys like Aragorn or Faramir (I want Faramir as a hero!!gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]), hobbits may not seem like much, but they might surprise one day.....
