Im finding it a challenge to keep the Heros alive once they are being sacked…

Whilst being sacked, am I right that the sacked Heros can be attacked?

Lets say that 2 out of 3 Heros are sacked, and the last hero quests which leaves attacks from Trolls undefended (yes, they are not back in the staging area)

Where would the wounds be placed, if any?  On the quested hero only? Or on any of the Heros, sacked or not.

Thanks

i would image the sacked heros could still take damage.

the trick is keeping troll camp around and putting fast hitch on bilbo
