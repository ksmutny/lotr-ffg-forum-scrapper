 I could post 50 cards, but I'm A) lazy and B) haven't put the time into the game. 

Using resources from two core sets(the best amount of core sets) and the first AP cycle,  people add card or cards to the deck until it is molded to perfection. And maybe one day FFG will give us a deckbuilding subforum :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] 

Feel free to use songs/attachments that grant resource icons outside of Leadership and Tactics, but try to keep the heroes noble, if you catch my drift, but feel free to list your own hero combinations.

Aragorn
Imrahil
Legolas

Vassal of the Windlord x3
Horn of Gondor x2
Valiant Sacrifice x3
Sneak Attack x3

This should be enough to establish the beginnings of a theme.

Go nuts!....or let my post die in obscurity....

I kind of like this idea... pity you chose this forum instead of the "deck builder" forum @ cardgameDB.com

This is sort of like UP AND DOWN a common forum game.... Maybe we should incorporate its rules... Also you need to define what the role of this deck is.. solo, 2player 3player 4 player.

1) You may add cards until the deck is at 50.
2) You may add only 1 card, but as many copies of it as rules allow
3) After the deck is at 50 you have to remove cards to add cards
4) You may JUST remove cards (change a card form 3 copies to 1 copies for example)
5) You may JUST add xtra cards (change a card fro m1 copies to 3 copies (swap rule applys)
6) You may add/change 1 hero.
