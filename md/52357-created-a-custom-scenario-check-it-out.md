My first (hopefully of many) custom scenarios can be found here:

Please check it out and comment! I've already received a lot of helpful comments, and another user even translated the scenario into French.

I'll be working on more custom scenarios in the future, so keep checking for more updates. Thanks!

Interesting.  I like the looks of it.  Might give it a try later (after I fail EfDG a few more times :S)
