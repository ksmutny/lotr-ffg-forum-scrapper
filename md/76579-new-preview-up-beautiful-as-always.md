Just wanted to start a discussion about the latest preview. What do some of you think of the upcoming Hobbit installment? I like what I see in this article! The mechanics look fun, though I still prefer to play the non-saga type scenarios.

   The HOBBIT expansion is the one that i like the most so far . It is the only one that makes me feel that i play more than the core and not just the same game in a defferent way (and some more cards sonreir [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_scripts/ckeditor/plugins/smiley/images/sonreir.gif]) so my expectations for the 2nd are realy high .Hope it will be one more great expansion .

It sounds really innovative. I'm excited for it, but especially for the heroes

Sounds really fun as always. I was hoping for some sort of barrel riding at the end of the Mirkwood part lol (which, who knows maybe there still will be, they just didn't mention anything like that) but either way, the quests sound like they will be really fun.

I agree with someone in that other thread though, that said "as long as these are better than the riddle mechanic", cause yeah, that didn't work out so well. Wasn't a fan of that.
