The title of my post says it all. What is the reason for this long stop between packs? Anyone know what's up?

The answer to "when is the new pack due out?" is: not nearly soon enough, lol. But I think it should only be a week or two more.

But yeah, I think they just took a little extra time since it had completed a full cycle and because we had gotten the Khazad-Dum big expansion. So like a breather before diving in for another full cycle and a chance for people who don't buy everything asap to get all caught up, etc.

A reasonable thing, but man do I NEED some new cards again! ^_^ [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_happy.png]

Good to hear your opinions guys! Yeah, I can understand the breather; but like you two (and everyone else I am sure), I am siked for some new cards! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] By the way Rich, nice Tolkien humor there...I wonder what Saruman wants with all of those printing presses? Whatever it is, it can't be good.Â
