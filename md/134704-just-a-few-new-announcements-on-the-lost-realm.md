Looks fun! And Tactics gets threat reduction and shadow card removal.

The quest looks kind of cool, but not much information to go on.  I'm definitely looking forward to the undead quest(s) more, so the orcs are somewhat less interesting.

 

I like the player cards they spoiled.  Tireless Hunters is a nice alternative to Westfold Outrider, which was too expensive to use just for that ability.  A 1 cost event seems more appropriate and I like the shadow discard.  With Mablung it's basically a free event.

 

I'm a little worried about giving tactics any sort of threat reduction, but Secret Vigil seems fairly innocent.  It's a one time use, isn't an event (no Hama recycle), and only gives a small threat reduction to the tactics deck itself.  Could be useful later in the game to stay in the Valour range.

I hadn't noticed that Tactigorn lost sentinel somewhere along the way. Curious change.

My guess is this is supposed to be a take on his more aggressive side. Much less about standing back and protecting, and much more about taking the fight to the enemy.

I don't like Secret Vigil, tactics lose a little of his own identity. All reduce threat elements must own to spirit sphere, at least not to tactics.

Yeah, I wondered what the reason for that was, also.  Perhaps it's considered a balance for a powerful ability?  Although the Lore version has a pretty darn powerful ability in its own right... Anyway, I don't think the Tactics Aragorn ever had Sentinel on him (that I noticed).  I proxied him a couple of months back for a run at the Saga expansions and noticed that he did not have it then.

They kind of touched on it in the article.  The ability of Tactagorn - or anyone with Tireless Hunters - to engage enemies that are engaged with other players reduces the need for sentinel and ranged.  So I think his lack of sentinel fits with his ability to engage enemies.  It's like that saying, the best defense is a good offense.

 

> Often, though, you’ll find yourselves facing situations in which multiple enemies enter the staging area at once, and your Tactics player can’t engage them all. These situations occur frequently enough that many Tactics players feel the need to incorporate Ranged and Sentinel characters, as well as events such as Feint [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/ffg_content/lotr-lcg/the-lost-realm/feint.png] (Core Set, 34), in order to help their friends across the table.

I dont know how much i can emphasize how much i'm looking forward to using Mablung once this expansion drops. It seems from not only the new player cards but even from the encounter cards it wont be remotely difficult to generate 3 or more resources a turn from his ability.

I really disagree with this.  First of all, the most powerful threat reducing card in the game is in Lore.  Secondly, Tactics should be able to reduce threat somehow.  Someday it would be nice to be able to field a solo tactics deck and not just in Gondor.

## 11 [Solaufein on February 12, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/134704-just-a-few-new-announcements-on-the-lost-realm/?do=findComment&comment=1445585)

I agree, a nice thematic way for Tactics to reduce threat is great. It is also nice that it is vastly inferior to others in existence, but still solid enough to be used.

 

I also love that it fits right in with my Tactics/Lore Ranger/Trap deck, both thematically and mechanically, but that is neither here nor there. :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Sweet cards, this expansions is going to be so EPIC!!!!!! I'm very glad for Secret Vigil, Tactics needed threat reduction (no sphere should have monopoly on doing one thing). It seems super powerful and it is, reducing all players threat by 3 will be easy but it is also balanced by being an attachment which is not as easy as events for reusing so it can't easily be repeated. There are ways to pull back attachments however and search for them in your deck so getting 10 threat reduction for all players in a good situation could be possible but it will more likely be 3-6 each game.

 

Tireless Hunters is of course great and will synergize with many cards :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

To be honest cards looks really powerful. Th ability ranger objective ally say for each quest card in play. That something really new.

I also like that as an attachment it is limited. Event threat reduction just happens. You play it, bam, threat lowered. This requires an enemy in play, and for it to be one that you can engage, fight and kill. Sure, it can lower everyone's threat by 3-4, but not quite as easily and/or consistently as some of the other options.

Bets on the new hero? I think it must be Halbarad... But are there any other guesses?

Love the new player cards, encounter cards and art. Honestly this and Treason of Saruman can not arrive fast enough, almost drooling over both at this point. Probably going to proxy Secret Vigil AND Tireless Hunters and try them out tonight. Tireless Hunters is PERFECT for two handed players like me for when that one annoying enemy slips through and engages the wrong deck and you don't have sentinel set up on your uber defender yet. Simply slam Tireless Hunters down and that one enemy that slipped through will instead engage the combat deck and lose its shadow card too. 

Secret Vigil is EXACTLY the kind of card I've been waiting for to add to my tactics/leadership deck. Gandalf or Galahadrim's Greeting (in my other deck that pairs with the tactics/leadership one) is the only way to lower threat normally and half the time you use Gandalf one of his other abilities would be just as useful as threat reduction. It also reduces all players threat not just the combat deck/player that kills the enemy which is pretty sweet. The minus 1 threat is just bonus, to be completely honest I think it would be a little cooler and more useful if it instead gave -1 attack instead of -1 threat. I think Haldir will probably combo well with this card as you can attach it to a high threat, high engagement enemy in staging reducing its threat (and thereby making it more bearable to leave in staging) and you can then snipe it with a buffed up Haldir's ability and reduce each players threat whilst doing so! Pretty potent combo if you can get it to work. Any direct damage effects like Gandalf, Galadhon Archer, Rumil or even goblin cleaver would also work really well with it as you can essentially put Secret Vigil on an enemy during the planning phase, then use a direct damage effect to instantly destroy said enemy, both removing its threat from the staging area (or stopping it from making an attack against a player that turn if already engaged) AND reducing your threat.

Tactics is still the least viable standalone sphere, though. I'm glad it gets some diversity.

I love how Secret Vigil's ability to lower the threat of the attached enemy by 1 has a pro and con side.

 

Pro: If the enemy is in the staging area still, then it will help with questing.

Con: It weakens the threat lowering ability by 1, which is a great way to balance it and prevent it from being too strong for Tactics, but still is a con in the players' eyes.

Your hatred for me would make you say any nonsense against me, so I wont even bother.

 

joezim007, it doesn't weakens the threat lowering ability because it lowers the threat by the printed enemy threat.

Oops, missed that "printed" key word. Hmm. That seems a bit too strong now. 3+ threat enemies are not uncommon, so this is generally more powerful than Galadhrim's Greeting (in multiplayer at least). Granted, it still has a limited effect for individual players' threat levels, so it won't drop any one player substantially. I kinda liked the -1 threat reduction, but then again, cards like Ranger Spikes would also affect the threat reduction, which would suck.

 

Oh well. I'm not gonna complain. Boromir will be happy with this card for sure. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I am not sure more powerful is the right word. It is a greater threat reduction the Greeting, but it is a bit more conditional. Greeting can always buy some time for a player at 49. This requires some planning to do so. If a shadow card increases threat to 49, that player can't be saved with this, but they can be saved with Greeting. In addition, it requires an enemy to be out, not exactly rare, but in some scenarios isn't guaranteed either. Further, that enemy must be a good choice, meaning it has to allow attachments and be engageable/killable. These trade offs lead to a potentially bigger threat reduction. Pretty neatly balanced to my eyes.

I've been away for a few weeks, but now that I have access to internet I just saw these spoilers. Secret Vigil is of course great, but I'm not a big fan of Tireless Hunters. In solo it seems pretty worthless, especially since it's a combat action. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I see no use for it in solo, except for engaging a few boss enemies.

I could give a few specialized conditions where it's useful, but I think you're right in general. There are situations where optionally engaging an enemy has a penalty, and others where the enemy returns to the staging area after attacking.

It does discard the shadow card though, which is something.

I really like both cards. Especially Secret Vigil... having a Second Breakfast is looking rather more appealing these days now too. 
 
Both cards add to the difficultly I already have with Tactics... namely that I only like to splash them and there are already far more tactics cards I want to include, than I could ever fit into a deck. 
 
And it is cool to see a really powerful threat reduction come out that will benefit 3-4 player games. I hope that this helps with some of quests that ramp nastily for 3-4 player games.

Totally agree Tireless Hunters is a great card to move enemies that have engaged the 'wrong' deck/player; whether lacking defenders or attackers, or they already have too many other engaged enemies or the player wants to get the best out of Galadhrim Bow or whatever. And would cover nicely for a lack of sentinel.

I do find it ironic that you will be able to use a questing Spirit deck... with a just touch of Tactics to attach "Secret-vigil" to an enemy before you "Ride them Down". Talk about role reversal :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]  ...or perhaps a Théoden led Tactics questing deck with a splash of Spirit? ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

It is easier to play something like that on a location, as it nearly always stays in play until planning phase. Most enemies with high threat are easy to kill or should be killed fast because of their high attack, so letting them stay until planning phase is another cost.

## 42 [Eu8L1ch on February 19, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/134704-just-a-few-new-announcements-on-the-lost-realm/?do=findComment&comment=1455685)

My 2 cents about Secret Vigil:

I think it is pretty balanced.

For Solo play it gives Tactics, for the first time (barring Gandalf of course), threat reduction which is just vital for a host of tactics-based decks - especially those reliant upon attacking the staging area(Forth Eorlingas!, Hands upon the Bow, Rangers with Tactics splashed in for weapons etc.).

On the other hand, it scales with the # of players so it gains in raw power what it lost in terms of granting access to a key ability.

The problem I have with this card is, as Glaurung said, that threat reduction was not supposed to be part of Tactics; in my opinion  it becomes a problem of keeping each sphere unique while granting all of them access to key abilities (reminds me of color pie from MTG and all the issues related to it).

I think Tactics badly needs some additional support for solo play: no card draw, no threat reduction, very few resource acceleration, no questing power means it doesn't stand a chance against almost every scenario, while playing solo.

What leaves me doubtful is that its effect is very powerful for its cost: more often than not it will be 3 threat reduction for a cost of 1. Yes, you have to sustain additional costs, but it's still very good for a sphere that was not supposed to get threat reduction at all, until now.

I see an analogy with Ancient Mathom, which is a very good card providing an ability that its sphere would otherwise completely lack: in this case I think balance is achieved through making it the only (non-hero) card providing that ability for Spirit.

 

In the end, I trust the ability of the design team so I think it will end up being balanced.

Maybe, only one card about reduction threat in one sphere is like a card that can only 1 copy go inside a deck. You cant hope decrease threat effects as a plan, if you don't want to depend of a lot of lucky. So this card is occasional. Glaurung was ok in his comments.

I dunno...I see the value in keeping the spheres distinct, but also think that each sphere should have some kind of (maybe limited) response to each of the different types of challenges that the game commonly presents. Having each sphere have some form of thematically congruent card draw, resource gen, location management, etc provides variety for deck builds and playstyles. Of course, having each sphere maintain its specialty is important too. Otherwise everything gets diluted and same-y.

A difficult line to walk for sure.

I wouldn't like all spheres to be good at all things equally... but lets face it, till quite recently Tactics lagged a long way behind the other spheres in terms of soloing. So long as each sphere keeps, mainly to its traditional favour then i'm all for a little variety. Its not like tactics has a monopoly on combat

Spheres should have specializations that they alone are best at. But they shouldn't have a monopoly, they just get to do that easiest and get more cards for that specialization. Spirit is best at threat reduction. It has many ways to do so and it usually as easy as playing the card and go. Tactics having some threat reduction is a good thing even if they have to work for it (playing the attachment then killing the enemy).

 

If Tactics can't have threat reduction I don't think Spirit should have a hero with an attack higher than 2, or ways to do direct damage (Ride Them Down). Stick to roads guys in blue, only tactics can smash face. :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

As a solo player, I agree that all spheres should be able to do a little bit of everything, even if some things they can do very rarely and not as efficiently, if only so that they can be played mono-sphere in solo. I really like Secret Vigil for this very reason.
