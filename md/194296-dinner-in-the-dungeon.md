Easily one of my most anticipatef packs ever. They really raised my expectations with the Dunedain and Noldor support. Here's hoping they deliver.

## 3 [Raven1015 on November 24, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194296-dinner-in-the-dungeon/?do=findComment&comment=1906302)

That last piece needs to be the cover of a metal album.

## 4 [John Constantine on November 24, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194296-dinner-in-the-dungeon/?do=findComment&comment=1906303)

The last hero is a Spirit one, that's why I'm stoked the most.

If i get it right, when this undead fellow destroys an ally, the ally change side and becomes undead? If this is the case i really like it :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

## 6 [Bullroarer Took on November 25, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194296-dinner-in-the-dungeon/?do=findComment&comment=1906905)

That's how it appears. Like Walking Dead.

## 7 [GrandSpleen on November 25, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194296-dinner-in-the-dungeon/?do=findComment&comment=1906945)

Probably will be some other ways to make some undead as well (treacheries?)... otherwise it would be very easy to avoid the mechanic entirely (no chump blocks).  In any case an ally-less deck seems like it might be strong here

## 8 [banania on November 25, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194296-dinner-in-the-dungeon/?do=findComment&comment=1907070)

They raise my expectations too concerning this pack, and Noldor-Dunedain interaction. It seems to me the "Tale of Tinuviel" event will enable some kind of global effect for both those traits.

That spirit hero gotta be Arwen, as it was hinted it'd work with Elrond's sons. Could be a second version of Elrond, it would make sense.

I also believe there is to be a non-unique Dunedain bowman ally, and a Lore attachment (Weather-Stained Cloak) that i'd really like to see right now. Some more defensive capabilities for Rangers would make my Faramir-Damrod-Denethor deck more reliable.

## 9 [Valiko33 on November 25, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194296-dinner-in-the-dungeon/?do=findComment&comment=1907104)

Spirit Elrond would be amazing, espacially with a resource ability. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

Something like :

Action: Choose a hero and discard a card from your hand that has a cost equal to the top card of your discard pile, to add 1 resource to his resource pool. (Limit twice per round)

 

Hope the Dunedain leadership Weapon will be good too.

Looks too much like sphere bleeding to me. Resource generation should stay in Leadership.

 

I forgot about this Dunedain weapon, this definitely needs to be included into the mono-leadership Dunedain deck.

Kinda a bit late for that, mate :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

And I'm afraid, that rule was broken by the very core set:

Yes, I understand that, you are right, there is sphere bleeding in this game  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png].  I realise my message missed his purpose. I just wanted to say I don't like too much sphere bleeding, which I acknowledge is a vague notion, just a feeling, nothing more.

## 13 [John Constantine on November 25, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194296-dinner-in-the-dungeon/?do=findComment&comment=1907149)

Well, that depends on the way it's done. Introducing a 2-costed spirit attachment that exhausts to add 2 resources to a hero would be plain wrong, but all previous out-of-leadership effects that added resource were pretty smart and thematic about it.

## 14 [banania on November 25, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194296-dinner-in-the-dungeon/?do=findComment&comment=1907245)

Yep agree, the fact that "out-of-sphere" effects are not straightforward is a good thing, regardless.

## 15 [DukeWellington on November 25, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194296-dinner-in-the-dungeon/?do=findComment&comment=1907361)

More than one color can do something without it being considered color bleed. For instance, shadow cancellation or discard is in many colors and colors other than green can draw cards in different was (foe hammer, ancient mathom). Sometimes the color identity just means that one color is better than others or the effect in question must be tied to a certain area (like combat for red).

It seems to me that red is also allowed to do resource generation with cards like the Horn or Mablung. Red is just not as good as purple and, like all things red, it needs a connection to combat in some way. Spirit, however, should not have resource generation, in my opinion. If it did it would be a card like ranger supplies, but that still feels better in purple IMO.

## 16 [Bullroarer Took on November 25, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194296-dinner-in-the-dungeon/?do=findComment&comment=1907374)

Maybe it's as simple as Arwen gives one Noldor character +1 attack and another Noldor character +1 defense.

## 17 [Bullroarer Took on November 25, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194296-dinner-in-the-dungeon/?do=findComment&comment=1907377)

I still think it will have something to do with discard though as this was hinted at in the video.

## 18 [John Constantine on November 25, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194296-dinner-in-the-dungeon/?do=findComment&comment=1907393)

Have you heard of Zigil Miner?

## 19 [DukeWellington on November 25, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194296-dinner-in-the-dungeon/?do=findComment&comment=1907521)

I think Zigil Miner is a poorly designed card in terms of flavor. The only thing good about it, flavorwise, is the discard theme for dwarf tribe. Spirit should not get resources and how does digging for gold relate to blue? I think it would be better as a purple card. It was made back when blue could do everything. I also think Unexpected Courage is off color, but not as bad because blue should have some ready effects.

Spirit has lots of readying effects, I haven't counted but I'd wager leadership and spirit are neck and neck.

## 21 [John Constantine on November 26, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194296-dinner-in-the-dungeon/?do=findComment&comment=1908223)

Just counted through cardgamedb, leadship has 18, and spirit 11. This is sorta not purely correct way to compare, however, as there are things like scope, conditions of readying, repeatability and all that stuff to each card.

## 22 [GrandSpleen on November 26, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194296-dinner-in-the-dungeon/?do=findComment&comment=1908687)

I'll take a stab--

 

Spirit cards with some of readying effect:
-Idraen

-Eomund

-Hama

-Snowmane

Westfold Horse-breaker

-Unexpected Courage

-Ever my Heart Rises

-Miruvor

-Steed of the Mark

-Spare Hood and Cloak

-Renewed Friendship

 

 

....11 cards.

 

 

..and Leadership:

-Aragorn

-Prince Imrahil

-Elrohir

-Sam

-Faramir (hero)

-Forlong

-Gimli (ally)

-Heir of Mardil

-Orthanc Guard

-Cram

-Ever Vigilant

-Common Cause

-Grim Resolve

-Strength of Arms

-Lure of Moria

-Swift and Silent

-Descendants of Kings

-Taste it Again

 

 

-18 cards.

 

I got the same count as John Constantine. So yeah, leadership has many more readying cards than Spirit, but it's certainly not an out-of-sphere sort of effect to put a readying card into Spirit.

Unexpected Courageous?

## 24 [John Constantine on November 26, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194296-dinner-in-the-dungeon/?do=findComment&comment=1908758)

Light of Valinor is not readying effect per se.

## 25 [GrandSpleen on November 26, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194296-dinner-in-the-dungeon/?do=findComment&comment=1908759)

Weird, I remember looking at it on the list.  How did I miss typing that one in?  I'll replace Light of Valinor with UC, but that's splitting hairs a bit!

Well, when it comes to these kinds of discussions splitting hairs is where most of the debate occurs. For instance, I agree that ready effects are fine in Spirit, but I draw a distinction between a character readying himself (or herself with Idrean) and an outside effect readying a character. When the ready effect is internal it exemplifies spirit. When an outside force ready that signifies leadership. Now by this UC is perfectly within flavor, so I my problem with it is more that it is too cheap (should probably cost 3) or should be limited to blue heroes. Those kind of limits don't apply to purple IMO. That being said, I also love the flavor of food having a ready effect (cram, lembas). All such comments from me are in the tone of "if I designed LOTR" and not meant as an criticism of the actual game :-)

I think that Spirit is mostly good for questing boost and threat reduction.

 

Leadership is mostly good for readying effects and for resources.

## 28 [danpoage on November 27, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194296-dinner-in-the-dungeon/?do=findComment&comment=1909261)

In addition to readying and resource acceleration, Leadership has stat-boosting as a sub-theme. Dúnedain Warning, Mark and Quest, For Gondor!, Sam Gamgee, Durin's Song and Celeborn all being examples.
