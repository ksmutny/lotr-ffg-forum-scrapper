The title pretty much says it all: do only characters that are exhausted ready during the refresh phase? i.e., characters that are already ready do not additionally "ready"? This is relevant for effects such as Silvan Tracker and Wellinghall Preserver.

 

I feel like I already know the answer -- Core rules, p. 22 states, "During the refresh phase, all exhausted cards ready" -- but I'm just making sure.

Yeah, it's got to be that only exhausted characters ready.  Otherwise there would be no difference between Silvan Tracker saying "heal each character that readies" or "heal all characters."  Well, except for exhausted characters who are for some reason prevented from readying, but that is rare.

Same with any readying effect I think. You can't ready a readied character. So even if you played a Grim Resolve in the refresh phase, Silvan Tracker won't do any additional healing.

moral of the story; always exhaust these two allies to do something each round or you won't be getting their healing!  :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Mmm .. the Silvan Tracker must not ready for his effect. It grants all silvan characters to heal when the silvan character readies.

My bad, haven't looked at the card in a while. You are indeed correct.

Can't understand your interpretation JanB.

 

1 - Silvan Tracker is a Silvan.

2 - His response heals a silvan character when that character readies during refresh phase

3 - It doesn't excludes him.

4 - If he readies during refresh phase, all requisites of his response are met.

 

Why wouldn't his response be able to heal him?

 

Am i missing something?

I think he was just point out that the Silvan Tracker doesn't have to be exhausted for other Silvans to heal.  Yes, he has to be exhausted to heal himself.

He was responding to PsychoRocka as PsychoRocka forgot that Silvan Tracker does not need to ready in order to trigger its effect for Silvan characters.  Wellinghall Preserver must ready in order to trigger his effect.

You should read JanB's "The silvan tracker must not ready" as "the silvan tracker doesn't have to ready."  It looked like a second language thing to me.

Although the Silvan Tracker does not need to ready, the character's benefiting from his healing do need to become exhausted so they can ready to receive the benefit.
