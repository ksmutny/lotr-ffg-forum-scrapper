Can Radagast heal Enemies of the type Creature?

 

For use in the following combo:

Play a Forest Snare on an Enemy Creature engaged with you.

Attack it with Háma to retrieve a Tactics card from the discards.

Then use Radagast to heal the Enemy, if needed.

i highly doubt it….enemies are never player cards no matter what their traits…mind you it doesnt specify 'you control' but i still doubt it

 Your answer would also imply you wouldn't be able to use Radagast's ability to heal Creatures controled by other players.

I'd say he can do. It makes little sense, but I think so far it's not forbidden to waste your resources. lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif]

 Radagast loves all the little beasties.  Even the icky spiders.

It's an odd corner case, and I don't know that I'd ever design a deck around it, but it is perfectly legal given the card text. Radagast doesn't require that you control the Creature.

I would have to agree with this catch as Radagast states 'Creature' but does not specify 'Hero' or 'Character' like other 'healing cards'.  Limited in its usefulness though, apart from a source of returning those cards continually.  Another reason to run this wizard when not using Eagles.  Cheers!

When Radagast come to the game i though: Aga this guy can heal any creature even if they are enemies.But for now there is no point to heal any creature-enemies so lets wait and see maybe there will be some combo with that. So look like the first reason why Brown Wizards can heal the enemies.Very cool congratulation! Yes in my opinion is totally legal.

You Forest Snare a Creature enemy, keep hitting it with Mirkwood Runner and move the hits with Infighting onto the enemies revealed by the encounter deck. At one point you want to hit the creature with only two hp left, so you choose to heal 1 damage to keep it alive and have the highest amount of damage on it (after MR attacks). It probably cannot get more situational than this but there is another combo.
