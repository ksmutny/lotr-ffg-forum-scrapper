My question is, does Rossiel's ability target a card or not?

Looking at the FAQ [http://www.lotr-lcg-quest-companion.gamersdungeon.net/#Rule152], it seems to me that her ability works similar to Pippin's response (the example given in the FAQ), and therefore her ability should work.

In the case of Pippin, you read the engagement cost from the immune card and compare it to your threat, and if the first is higher than the second you can draw a card.

In Rossiel's case, you read the trait on the immune card and compare it to one in the victory display, and if it matches she gets +2wp/def.

Does this sound right?

Agree it should work.Â  Her ability targets Rossiel, not an enemy or location.
