I am relatively new to the mythogy of Middle Earth (seen the movies only until now, just finished the first book and am heading towards the Two Towers), but what characters aside from Thalin and Berevor were completley made up by FFG?  I enjoy getting into the lore of the games I play.  Thanks.

Ufthak is one of the orcs of the Cirith Ungol garrison, I think. Not a Chieftain though, or even a Chieftan.

I've read a few and have been meaning to read some others.  Thanks.  I'am a little disappointed that I recently heard elves didn't come to Helm's Deep.  I was looking forward to reading more about that in the next book ;^)  That brings me to another question:  What do LOTR fans in general think about Jackson's trilogy in terms of how well it fits the books?

well my opinions are well know on this forum and others- basically

they are great films, perhaps 2 of the greatest films ever made (TT sucked even as a film) but as adaptions they are pretty poor

this is one of the reasons im not going to see the hobbit- despite being an huge fan….its just too dear to me, and i dont want it ruined, which going on some of the previews, i think it may be…its no problem and i personally dont feel that im missing out as my images from my first reading will always by my 'the hobbit', just as my images from the books will always be my 'lord of the rings'

the problem with the books is that they dont go well as films- im talking more about the tom bombadil/ barrowwights and so on….these things were left out and the reason was theyd make for boring cinema- most people think this ok, but i personally think if a book doest go well as an adaption without changing it alot- then quite simply- dont make it…..those parts that were left out held all the charm and magic that made middle earth so real in my imagination. if i had seen the films first i dont think i would have gotten as into it as i am now, having read all the books first……and i hold myself fortunate that i dont picture any of the actors when read the books and have all my fond memories of my read throughs

and for once people cant give the 'it gives it good publicity and spreads the books' argument….come on- tolkien's legacy will live on regardless

thats my opinions on the film- i love them as films, but i do not feel tolkien would approve, having cut out many of his best parts, and even if he would, i dont, and unlike everyone else here, i have to live with myself, so have to keep myself happygui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]

oh yeah, and what i dislike most about the whole thing is that every thing tolkien after the films uses a red glowing eye as sauron-( that includes you ffg) its a metaphor dammit! we are given multiple references to saurons body, especially the fact he only has 4 fingers on 1 hand, now how would an eye have a hand?

I kind of know where you are coming from.  Being a Star Wars fan, the original trilogy holds a special place for me, and while I really enjoy aspects of the prequels, they didn't have the same magic as the source material.   I liked the LOTR trilogy and will probably see the Hobbit, but I do not have as yet (will after I read Return of the King and reread The Hobbit) a reference point for thier authenticity, though I thought the first film fit the book reasonably well.  Since you mentioned them, could you explain a bit more about the Barrowwights?  I was a bit confused about them in the book.  Thanks again.

of course

the area of the barrow down is near breeland, which lies within the old kingdom of arnor, more specifically what became Cardolan (which can be found in chapters 4 belowin my signature)

now arnor was a twin kingdom of gondor, however unlike gondor it broken, split into minor kingdoms, and eventually was pretty much ruined by the witch king in the third age, but many of their kings were buried on the barrows (which are inspired by such places in england) and afterwards the witch king sent evil spirits to inhabit them

interestinly in the original drafts tolkien had the nazgul as mounted barrow wights

Ah, I see.  I was confused as to whether they were ghosts or actual beings.  Thanks.  I have more questions, but I read through your website first as you may have already answered them.

I also dislike the films but for slightly different reasons than richsabre has cited. I could cite many objections, but in brief: the first one was quite promising but I rapidly became annoyed by the way Jackson's adaptation handled a number of key characters and situations, stripping them (in my view) of subtlely and nobility. Examples: Gimli (becomes a stock comedy dwarf), Denethor (just a mad fool), Faramir, Elrond (now just hates Men, and also somehow manages to teleport to Dunharrow!)

I actually think the Hobbit films will be better because the tone of the books is better suited to Jackson's knockabout approach.

PS Rich - do you know the old BBC radio dramatisation? I am just relistening to that childhood favourite - I think it is really pretty good. The scriptwriters even delved into Unfinished Tales for some of their material BUT they did axe Tom Bombadil and the Barrow-downs…

## 15 [Robert McMutton on June 25, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/66475-non-canon-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=649143)

 I agree with both of you, richsabre and jjeagle. As a Tolkien's fan, I dislike quite aspects of the films, mainly all that jjeagle commented above about changes in key characters and situations (Elrond is one of my greater concerns).

Anyways, the first film is the most accurate of the three, the third more or less, and the second one should be burning in hell forever. demonio.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/demonio.gif]

That being said, I am very very worried about the Hobbit film. I saw all the Dwarves, and frankly, some of them seems all but dwarves. preocupado.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/preocupado.gif]

As rich said, my readings of the books gave me my picture of Middle Earth, which quite differs from Peter Jackson's one.

## 16 [lleimmoen on June 25, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/66475-non-canon-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=649294)

I totally think the Hobbit will be much better as an adaptation. Most of the restrains that held the LotR will no longer be there. I think Jackson loves and knows the work. Yes, he's made some strange choices but he's done some very good ones, like casting Sean Bean or Ian McKellen in major roles when we could have got stars (by standards of then) instead. And I like the casting for this one even better, Freeman, Armitage, Cumberbatch are all great and non-populistic choices.

Also the amount of work that was put into the movies is beyond any other film project it seems; from planting gardens in the Shire long before shooting, to making every piece of armour; and the outcome shows. And the music is easilly one of the most memorable in cinematic history. Some of the scenes, like the charge of the Rohirrim in either of the latter two films, are just wonderful. And so is the tense and emotional action in Moria or on Amon Hen.

Still I think the movies deserved six volumes to fit the material because when you look at it, much was cut off, and much was simplified. And I think the movies could easilly stand on their own if made after each book (of which there are six).

That's why I'm happy they're making two films off the Hobbit because it lessens the chances we get simplified characters, indeed as Denethor or Elrond were in the LotR (as much as I like the actors who portrayed, especially Weaving).

Although I am very critical of the films I agree with these points. I think the visual recreation of Middle-earth that, as you say, the films went to incredible lengths to put together, was almost universally excellent. In fact this is what makes the other failings of the films so sad - that this opportunity and this work was thrown away.

And I agree that the music is brilliant - speaking of which, does anyone else share my habit of listening to the film music while playing the game? It really enhances the experience for me. I have the symphony version and you can find this in full on youtube.

## 19 [Titan on June 25, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/66475-non-canon-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=649422)

I have to say that if I had not seen the first movie, I probably would have never read the books. Personally, I think the movies are excellent. As mentioned above, I find that many of Tolkien's plot twists are difficult to incorporate in movies. The Tom Bombadil part, for example, I'm not sure if it would have been boring, as Rich suggested, but it is just irrelevant in terms of the main storyline. With 3 movies clocking in at or near 3 hours long, some things have to go.

Another thing that is difficult to incorporate is characters that play a key role, but are around only briefly. Hence why Glorfindel is nowhere to be found or for that matter, Erkenbrand in Two Towers. Instead they give Arwen and Eomer more to do, so as to have more continuity. I can understand why purists don't like it, but I think overall it works fine. The one thing I've never really understood is why the elves come to Helm's Deep, since they don't make that much of a difference, they all die there and that particular change never seems to really build into anything else. 

## 20 [richsabre on June 25, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/66475-non-canon-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=649502)

i think with the elves it was a way to show how they 'came to the aid of men' instead of buggering off to the undying lands…..which of course didnt happens anyways as the elves played a major part in holding off dol guldur during the war of the ring, held the fellowship in lothlorien (and of course with legolas) and ive also a feeling that either galadriel of elrond was responsible for sending the grey company, which of course had the twins present at the pelennor and morannon

the whole point of the lord of the rings and elves was that tolkien was making a point- the 3rd age was the age of men, and the elves were dwindling which makes the whole thing of them coming to helms deep strange as jackson addressed this point through the rather moody and ignorant version of elrond when he states to gandalf that the ages of elves is over and gandalf says 'we must look to men' there fore its then contadictory to have them fly in action movie style at the last moment only to get slaughtered…..

also while we're on the subject, does no one think the soldiers of gondor were portrayed as patheticly bad at fighting, compared to rohan. i mean i know they were up against 100,000 orcs wheres rohan had it a bit easier, but c'mon, they were the descendants of numenor, had the best armor and weapons, they could at least have taken a few orcs down with them haha

## 21 [Titan on June 25, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/66475-non-canon-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=649539)

I certainly can agree to that. Throughout the whole movie, Gondor soldiers are getting pushed around. I always recall the part when the orcs break into the city and a perfectly assembled battleline gets hammered in a matter of moments by them. Compared to that, Rohan does great since they actually wipe out many of the orcs still outside the city. But then again, how much can you expect from them? Gandalf had to rally them back to the battlements, even before the battle started, for crying out loud!

## 22 [gatharion on June 26, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/66475-non-canon-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=649690)

 My thoughts on the movies are a bit more kinda than most of those who seem to be speaking up, but I do also get where they're all coming from and don't necessarily disagree with the points they are making.

 

I also disliked the elves at Helm's Deep, although largely because they were all just killed and then never even mentioned again. I disliked that Merry and Pippin basically tricked the ents into going to war, making the ent moot, well…moot.

 

I actually approve of the changes done with Elrond and Faramir as I felt that they made for a stronger narrative as presented in the movie, but I certainly can't begrudge anyone who thought the characters were done a disservice. 

I missed the scouring of the Shire, but got why it also would have seemed like an anti-climax.

 

Overall I loved the casting and visuals in the movies. Those are the voices and visuals I get now in my head when I read the books.

## 23 [Troymk1 on June 26, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/66475-non-canon-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=650078)

If you looked into the history of that movie project it turns out that time and time again Peter Jackson made decisions that angered the powers that be because he was trying to uphold as much as possible of the true feel of Middle Earth.

I saw the inaccuracies, I saw what was left out. And here and there I felt a pang of disappointment, but upon examination I asked myself could I as a director/writer/producer have done better. And the answer is a resounding no. It's a different medium and it wasn't just made for the Tolkienistas (of which I am honoured to count myself) But as a film that had to stand on its own as a film. Or 10 hours or so of film to be exact. 

I think we forget what a monumental gamble this trilogy was to make investing a third of a Billion bucks behind  somewhat of a dark horse director. 

You guys are reminding me of my friend the archeologist who walked out of the film Gladiator for its inaccuracies.  ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

 

 

 

## 24 [richsabre on June 26, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/66475-non-canon-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=650118)

often we do these things and as i see it, we have every reason to.  i mean if we have strong feelings for something which we then see tore apart, then it annoys us correct……but some people are pickier than others…personally i am stubborn as a mule when it comes to things like accuracy.

for instance, im an astrophysics student, and i cant help but cringe at the horrible innacuracies of sci fi films, using terms such as 'light years' and 'parsec' incorrectly, especially to depict length of time instead of distance…not to mention all the other aspects of physics, which being honest, if you are going to try making a film based on science, even one loosely based, you are going to want to hire a consultant. in films i have seen if such as person was hired, they want fired. quick

anyways my point is that its only natural to feel cheated out of certain aspects of the film. i did not know about the fact that jackson tried to keep true and the powers that be held him back, so i have restored a bit of respect in him, but its only shifted my annoyance elsewhere.

Like Titan mentioned above, I began reading the books as a result of watching the movies.  I tried reading them when I was a teenager, but I just could not grasp Tolkien's writing style and did not finish the Fellowship.  I am almost read through the trilogy now, and what strikes me as a strong deviation from the books to the films is the introduction of romance between Aragorn and Arwen.  I was expecting it to play a prominent role in the novels, but it appears that it was something that Jackson developed mostly on his own, as there is just an occassional mention of the relationship in the novels.  This may change as I finish TRotK, but I imagine Jackson was inclined to include the relationship to pull-in a wider audience.

My greatest fear concerning The Hobbit is that it will not live up to the lofty expectations set before it by what is THE definitive resource on the topic; the Rankin/Bass animated film. gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]

Most of the Aragorn/Arwyn stuff is from the Tolkien. It's in the appendices at the back of Return of the King. 

## 27 [Khaden on June 26, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/66475-non-canon-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=650246)

As an avid fan of the movies I still cannot stand the way in which Faramir was portrayed in the films.  Granted, it would have taken up so much more time in order to flesh out his character the way that Tolkien does over the course of TT and ROTK, so I understand why Jackson and crew may have chose to portray him more of as a "younger Boramir" for lack of a better expression.  He seems more concerned with impressing his father by presenting him a trophy (the ring).  He seemed so much more intelligent and… softer of heart, if that makes sense.  More of a leader and less of a young man.

Overall though I really do love the films, but of course the books are by far much more magical.

I guess some people have more trouble than others suspending belief. I can understand where he was coming from though, because as a firefighter/paramedic I always shake my head when I watch the film Backdraft and see firefighters walking through burning buildings with no air packs on. Or when on many shows, someone does CPR for a couple of seconds and brings back someone from the brink as if nothing had happened.

To be completely off topic, I found Gladiator did have some subtle nods, though. For example, the emperor Commodus(Joaquin Phoenix) actually did fight as a gladiator, in what is suspected were "fixed" contests. Or in the opening battle, when the barbarians fire their arrows at the oncoming romans, and you see them using their shields in a particular way to cover in front and above themselves, a roman battle technique knows as "testudo" (turtle).

To further this tangent…

I recall after Gladiator came out and people were asking (or sometimes assuming!) that Commodus was really killed in the arena and that Russel's character was a historical figure.

To come back to the Elves at Helm's Deep. That scene bothers me the most perhaps. And it is not solely for the fact the Elves were there but much more for the fact they were unable to stand in sword-fight aginst the Uruk-hai. That for me was perhaps the dumbest thing mr Jackson did with the trilogy. An elite Elven warrior was of course far superior to an Uruk. Of course they could still die against them (when highly outnumbered) but to see in one shot Legolas and Gimli killing 40+ of them each and on the other the Elves being slaughtered is just against the lore completely.

If Elrond ever sent troops to aid in battle, they would rank among the best fighters in Middle-earth I would think.

## 32 [schmoo34 on June 27, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/66475-non-canon-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=650533)

I have enjoyed both the books and the movies and I do try to reconcile things often.  I don't consider myself to be an expert on either, however, the Tom Bobadil thing was always important to me, when reading the book, because he was a carefree man who was immune to the ring.  He picked it up and handed it back and just shrugged it off.  How many others would get all gnarled up over it?  It just seemed profound, deep, and significant for me and it somehow should have made it into the movie.

The other part I found funny is that the hobbits, Merry and Pippin, in particular are bumbling fools yet the movie portrayed them as bumbling fools in areas where they weren't in the book and then made them out to be heroes in areas where they were bumbling fools in the book.

From a pure disgust point of view, the movie really bothers me when Legolas does that contortion where he mounts a horse while running and defies physics and looks like he snapped his back in half while doing so.  It is visually distasteful and so not necessary.

Now for the praise from the move.'

The books have three parts to them that are annoying for me, as a reader, and I'm so very pleased the movies cut them out.

1) All of the eating…eat, eat, eat…everything is about a meal, and cooking.  The movie did incorporate it, but it didn't dwell on it obsessively like the books do.

2) THe singing.  The songs are awful…I'm sorry, they don't do it for me.  I'm very happy it was "Lord of the Rings" and not "Lord of the Rings - the musical"

3) The books are notorious for characters being missing for long periods of time, then they finally meet and spend a large length of time "catching up".  One great example is that when Frodo fled from the shire, Gandalf wasn't there in the book, yet in the movie he was.  Frodo actually took months from the time Gandalf asked him to leave to the time he actually left.  ANd all of that time, Gandalf was away…and, of course, you learn nothing about it until they meet up again…so the book focuses 100% on Frodo all the time and then everything is "fireside catchup".  So very happy the movie diverted and showed other characters rather than keeping the point of view the book had.

Other minor things.  I liked how the movie provided more urgency to Frodo's exodus from Hobbiton.  The book really doesn't have any sense of urgency…as mentioned already, months have passed since Gandalf urged him to leave.  Even after he left, it was very nonchalont and he was simply going to his newly purchased home (He wasn't really leaving). 

I found it interesting that Frodo stole from Farmer Maggot when he was a child and in the book, when they came to Farmer Maggot's house, he actually made them dinner (They ate again…note the obsession with food) and were quite friendly.  Pippin was with them by happenstance and Merry didn't meet them until after that scene…yet the movie portrayed Merry and Pippin as stealing from Farmer Maggot (the way Frodo did as a child) and catapulted the story forward that way.

Also, there were significant dialogue between Gandalf and Frodo regarding the ring in Frodo's home that the movie skipped…then, much later on, while in Moria, Gandalf stops so he could remember where to go next and starts to recite and say the things that the book had way in the beginning.   I picked up on the difference, I noticed it, however, I thought the movie integrated it wonderfully.

Lastly, I felt that Galadriel's gifts were more significant in the book than portrayed in the movie.

schmoo34- those are all valid points and i can see why you would say them, i just thought id better say that before i say the next part

i couldnt disagree more. (sorry happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif])

all the parts that you addressed above were areas i loved in the books- in fact they made the books for me. i love all the descriptive parts, the presents at te party, the meals, the hobbit names, the landscape, the weather. i love it all

the singing…now i agree that it would have been very strange in a 21st century movie, but remember LOTR was wrote in the time around the 2nd world war. now while this isnt all that long ago, many of the songs and poems were infact from even longer ago, pieces that tolkien adapted and inserted in

what really adds to the charm is the very language used. it just fits. perhaps its because im english (im sorry if you are too as that point will have little meaning).

but in any case, different people, different tastes

Yes, that part made it seem like Legolas was the only surviving Elven warrior of some skill (well with Haldir not far behind but still). The prologue did much better job in showing Elven superior fighting skills.

As an avid fan of the movies I still cannot stand the way in which Faramir was portrayed in the films.  Granted, it would have taken up so much more time in order to flesh out his character the way that Tolkien does over the course of TT and ROTK, so I understand why Jackson and crew may have chose to portray him more of as a "younger Boramir" for lack of a better expression.  He seems more concerned with impressing his father by presenting him a trophy (the ring).  He seemed so much more intelligent and… softer of heart, if that makes sense.  More of a leader and less of a young man.

Overall though I really do love the films, but of course the books are by far much more magical.

You have practically stolen the words out of my mouth.  Yes, the elves at Helms Deep are a major annoyance.  However, the single thing that GRATES on me is the slaughtering of Faramir's character.  As much as I agree with Rich on the viewability of the films on their own merit (and I own them all in multiple formats and sets), I absolutley HATE that Jackson absolutely destroyed my favorite person in the trilogy.  A lot of my fellow Tolkien friends find it odd that my favorite character is a 2nd-tier man (important, sure, but hardly one of the fellowship, etc).  My reason is that he and Eomer (another personal fav) represent the FUTURE and hope of Middle-Earth.  Even Gandalf and Elrond acknowledge that the future belongs to man (as opposed to elves, dwarves, etc).  And while the Numenoreans of old have their bloodlines running out, Faramir and Eomer stand out as a change from the corrupted men of previous generations. 

Specifically, I feel that Faramir is even MORE important as a specific counterpoint to his brother.  Tolkien quite clearly paints the picture that Boromir was the stronger son, the leader, the one favored by his father, while Faramir is disdained and practially hated by Denethor.  The very inclusion of Faramir is to lead to the point where he is able to make a VERY conscious decision to withstand the draw of the ring, allowing the quest to continue and succeed.  This stands in direct contrast to his own "superior" brother who gave in to the ring's seduction for power and led to the breaking of the fellowship.  Faramir exists to be the anti-Boromir!

… and then Jackson completely @*#*'s this up and destroys his character in the movie.  **** you, Peter.  **** you.

I believe the urgency made sense in the movie but I think the lack of it made total sense in the book. For my part at least, I really loved how the book was slowly getting "darker and more dangerous." Whilst I was reading it first I had no idea what it was going to turn into. So that "revelation" was really my favourite part of the book one.

The book also took enough time to portray the lovely easy-going life of the Hobbits which was best to show when the danger was not yet as immediate, I feel.

i feel this way everytime i look at the preview of thorin and co. - people say that its good to break out of the 'dwarf cliche' ….but seriously, is any among us going to argue that when tolkien wrote the hobbit, he had anything but the stereotypical dwarf in mind. i would be strongly inclined that he did have a stocky, bearded fellow with a rough attitude in mind. i may be wrong, but i doubt it

PS - im finding all this anti-jackson support here very strange indeed- ive been basically ran off forums for speaking out against the films….

I am reading the Lord of the Rings, and have read The Hobbit a long time ago, but this Silmarillion, is that in the same universe as the others?  So three tales?  Does the Silmarillion take place prior to the Hobbit in the timeline and deal mostly with Elves?  Thanks.

This was done intentionally by JRRT.  After The Hobbit was published and became a big success, his publishers wanted more material from him.  As we are all aware, he had a wealth of back-story (thousands of years) already on paper and in mind.  But as we all know the history of Middle-Earth is MUCH darker than what the small snap-shot of The Hobbit portrays.  So when he presented the material he wanted to publish (the stories that would make up the Silmarillion, etc), the publishers basically said ,"Ummmm holy crap, that's WAY too dark.  Don't you have any more cute Hobbit stories?!?!?"

So Tolkien basically said, "Well, they don't want my back-story, which I'm NOT rewriting to be more kid-friendly… so I guess I'll write what happens after the Hobbit"….

Now that very fictional conversation paints WHY the LOTR trilogy (I know, I know, forgive me purists who insist on thinking of it as nine books… it's just easier saying "trilogy" than "novemology", which is a completely made up word I just thought of…) has that progression of getting darker.  He started it off with the Hobbits at a birthday party for Bilbo, and built it from there.  His goal was to slowly take the reader from The Hobbit to his darker stuff, and BRILLIANTLY used the Trilogy as his vehicle to do so.  By the time you finish the LOTR cycle, you are fully immersed in the dark world that Middle-Earth has become, and going back to read his darker stories (such as The Children of Hurin or The Fall of Gondolin, two of my personal favorites… and make Greek/Shakespearian tragedy look like the Smurfs) isn't so much of a shock.  Now if only Christopher hadn't muddled it all up… lol

hey….prepare for some spoilers as theres no way to explain without these

yes they all happen in the same universe, which is our universe just long long ago ….however its slightly more tricky..

the silmarillion happens from the creating of the world arda - which includes middle earth and valinor, by eru, through its several major wars between the elves and melkor, to its splitting and removal of valinor from middle earth so it cannot be reached by physical means…so it cannot be sailed to unless by magic. numenor, though found within modern versions of the silmarillion is actually a different book called akallabeth

be warned though, the silmarillion, though a wonderful and enchanting tale, is nothing like the hobbit or LOTR. its much heavier (and i dont mean weight haha). what i mean is that its sort of like reading bible text ie …and on this day eru did this and that, and the valar did this and that, and so on…..this puts ALOT of people off it, but it is definitly worth reading

have you read the history series ie the discarded drafts- if not i think you would find them very interesting, but in any case it sounds as if you have.

its interesting to note from the history series that tolkien

1. did not think he could top the hobbit (in a letter to Unwin)

2. cut out ALOT of the 'daftness' of the hobbit way of life to get to the 'darker' parts- so what we read would have been much lighter if he hadnt made that choice

its also interesting to note that he had two firm critics - his son and his publishers son! both of whom would hardly want dark parts

Don't get me wrong, it's definitely a Love-Hate relationship for me and Jackson.  I very much appreciate that he has worked very hard for over a decade to bring these to the screen, and honestly, as with ANY adaptaion there will be differences.  ***And at least it wasn't James Effing Cameron violating our beloved lore***….  That's why there are some things about the film that I consider "forgiveable", in so-much as they don't change the overall weight and importance of the storyline and lore:  For example, sorry Tom Bombadil-lovers (Brownmantle, who is a RL friend, will take GREAT umbrage with me here), I can see why that particular "scene" wasn't in the film.  It IS a bit lengthy and doesn't hold massive influence on the rest of the story (again, this is only talking about the differences in making a movie… in the book, it is an enjoyable section and helps flesh out personalities, etc).  Compare this to the VICIOUS ASSAULT ON FARAMIR's CHARACTER…. (so I am slightly enraged about that particular point… lol).  But I do feel that at a critical point in the book, Faramir's character completely influenced the outcome of the quest.  And therefore, to drastically CHANGE that (versus being excluded) make s a significant change to an important figure…

Anyway, I do truly appreciate Jackon's efforts, and whatever my issues are with his interpretations, at least he has provided me something to watch with my kids as an alternatvie to the freaking Twilight travesty (books AND movies), or whatever abomination Justin Bieber will be eventually starring in… lol

lol… I think you and I have the same outlook on these things, just with a different response!  I will definitely see The Hobbit (at least the first one), despite what reviews it gets.  I have to know for myself how true it holds.  Unless I was getting reviews from folk like yourself or my Tolkien-loving friends, there's no amount of E! entertainment or Siskel and Roeper that can form an opinion for me.

But for all of that, with what issues I have with the film LOTR adaptations, and as much of a pessimistic stance as I can seem to take, I truly am an optimist at heart.  I WANT them to be gret films… and definitely hope that they are!  I would love nothing more than for my kids to grow up loving the same world and stories that I did :-)

 I totally get hating on Jackson for making Faramir a weaker character than he was in the books. He really did. However, I think Peter Jackson was right to do so. By making Faramir weaker, he made the Ring stronger. One of the really REALLY difficult things to convey about the story, especially in a visual medium like film, is the power and menace that is manifest in a tiny little inanimate object. If film Faramir had acted like book Faramir then I think it would have significantly weakened the power of the Ring that they had been trying to build up. A lot of dramatic tension could have been lost right then and there. Besides they do ultimately give Faramir some redemption as he does eventually let Frodo go in a way that Boromir could not.

It's interesting so many say Faramir, I find Aragorn (despite the talent of VM) to be much further off in the adaptation. And especially Denethor.

On the other hand, Boromir, Sméagol, Gandalf, Galadriel or Théoden to be portrayed very, very well.

I would have to disagree with this a bit.  There was always that whiney-schreechy sound effect when the ring was exerting its influence over someone.  That was a pretty good indication that something was going on.  Now, if one were deaf and watching the movie, yeah, that concept would be a significant obstacle to overcome.

hey….prepare for some spoilers as theres no way to explain without these

yes they all happen in the same universe, which is our universe just long long ago ….however its slightly more tricky..

the silmarillion happens from the creating of the world arda - which includes middle earth and valinor, by eru, through its several major wars between the elves and melkor, to its splitting and removal of valinor from middle earth so it cannot be reached by physical means…so it cannot be sailed to unless by magic. numenor, though found within modern versions of the silmarillion is actually a different book called akallabeth

be warned though, the silmarillion, though a wonderful and enchanting tale, is nothing like the hobbit or LOTR. its much heavier (and i dont mean weight haha). what i mean is that its sort of like reading bible text ie …and on this day eru did this and that, and the valar did this and that, and so on…..this puts ALOT of people off it, but it is definitly worth reading

 

 

 

As a quick plug- thanks for the series you've got going on the lore, Rich.  I've just had time to amble my way through the first couple, but I enjoy not only the concise intro to to Middle-Earth you are providing the forum, but possibly even more the way you are able to "narrate" your way through questions in your own mind and how they relate to Tolkiens writings… well done, Mate!

You seem to be implying that Jackson rescued Tolkien from obscurity. Certainly the films increased awareness of and interest in the book dramatically. But Tolkien was not an obscure writer beforehand. TLOTR sold 32 million copies in the USA (I think) from 1965 to 2001. TLOTR was voted "book of the century" in a number of major public polls before the films were released.

Good points. But the movie really only is an adaptation. And I like how Jackson himself talks about it that way (not that it is not hard to escape the fact).

Further I think the movies are not the ultimate version. It's been a decade already, and a decade from now most of the active film-goers will not have seen the movies when they got out, so there will certainly be a time for a new version.

And if the rights get sold, I think Silmarillion could make a great series as well. I know it will be hard but with all the terrible sh*te that is being made in tons every year, why not stick to the good stuff.

i think the silmarillion would be easier to make into a movie- there isnt as much personal info and background, so the director has more freedom. for instance hundreds of years pass, entire wars and battles are fought, all within a few pages or a chapter. this means that as long as the director uses the names, lore and so on, they have the freedom to expand on these battles without being unfaithful to the book. this must be an easier situation that the trilogy

I would be glad if The Silmarillion is finally made into a TV Series. I think it would produce a better result, due to the huge time period it includes, and the lot of events that happens in the First Age, that it could be produced into more than 11 hours of visual resources.

But I don't think we will get this anyway.

And yes, I really think Silmarillion is good and ready for adaptation. One just needs to pick up the good threads of storyline. It is a shame JRRT hadn't had enough time to pull it more together.

As for his son, I think he did well with the likes of Children of Húrin. That book seems almost finished. And I wonder whether he shall make the other two big stories off the Silmarillion, I think he mentioned he was still working on Beren and Lúthien and the Fall of Gondolin (and the subsequent Voyage of Earendil and the War of Wrath I believe).

Ben is correct (as usual).

 I just wanted to pop on and say that I just finished rereading Fellowship and some of the stuff from the movies was really spot on. As fans we can get very nitpicky about missing elements or stuff that's different from how we envisioned it, but given the nature of Hollywood and even just the conceits of film making, it's fairly remarkable that Jackson got as much "right" as he did.

 

The scene where Boromir tries to take the ring, for instance. They play out very similar in the book and in the movie and I think Sean Bean simply nailed the shifting emotions displayed by Boromir there.

 

Also, I just have to say, I don't know how many times I've watched or read Gandalf's confrontation with the Balrog on the Bridge of Khazad Dum, but every time, either in print or on film, I get goosebumps.

 

 

 

Remake the LotR movies? I wouldn't count on that for at LEAST twenty to thirty more years. They were a massive undertaking and in many people's minds, the Jackson films were pretty definitive. A status that is only being cemented by the release of the Hobbit.

 

A Silmirilion TV show or movie(s)? I'd be bowled over if that EVER happened. For one, it doesn't have the name recognition that Hollywood likes, but also there just isn't enough cohesive story there. Someone else mentioned that as a selling point, but if you're having to make so much up whole cloth, then why even bother dealing with complexities of wrangling with the copyright issues? Plus, making engaging characters and linear plots for something that is supposed to span for hundreds of years, is going to be a more daunting challenge than most Hollywood screenwriters are likely to tackle. 

IMO, Hollywood has never gotten a solid grasp on something as comperatively simple as the stories of King Arthur; I can't imagine the Silmirilion faring well.

A storyteller needs more tools in his box than just sound effects. 

I'm not even sure what you're suggesting here…that Jackson just shouldn't have employed said "whiney-schreechy" sound with Faramir? That wouldn't make much sense within the logic of the movie.

Either there is an opportunity for Faramir to get corrupted by the Ring or there is not. If there is no opportunity then there is pretty much no point to him meeting Frodo at all. If there is, but Faramir can just hand wave it away, then the ring come across as easily dismissible which then makes the struggle of all the other characters who have had to resist the ring seem really odd.

Even Galadriel they had to show being momentarily tempted to take the Ring. Having Faramir brush it off when neither his brother nor the elf-queen could would have been really odd and felt inconsistent in terms of the much-vaunted lure of the Ring. Gollum doesn't follow Frodo all across Middle-Earth just because he thought the Ring matched his ratty loincloth.

I think they could have done with Faramir what they did with Aragorn. When confronted with the ring, Faramir could have simply kept glancing back at the ring. Instead of taking the Hobbits to Osgiliath, he could have led them through the forest, the whole time sneaking glances at Frodo. The audience members that don't know Faramir's character would suspect treachery, and those who are familiar would see that the ring is drawing him in without him ever giving in to it. I think a simple thing like making sure he keeps looking back to Frodo or the ring would effectively portray the power of the ring without destroying Faramir's character.

True points, all.  However, comparing the Silmarillion to the legends surrounding Arthur is a bit misplaced.  The reason Hollywood has had so many different tellings of King Arthur is precisely because of the MANY variations of him written throughout the last 1200 years (an Arthurian character was mentioned as early as the 9th century in Latin texts).  With the Silmarillion, you have a SINGULAR author and undisputed origin.

However, you are correct with the "name recognition" aspect.  However, with the success of the LOTR cycle (and the presumes success of the Hobbit films), I think Hollywood would definitely be able to tie in the marketing to those films.  But you are definitely spot on about trying to do the entire Silmarillion.  I think they could have some success with telling specific stories;  the ones that have enough substance for entire films.  The Children of Hurin, the tales of Beren and Luthien, and the Fall of Gondolin are the most dominant (although that last one probably needs more tie-in to other stories to be a stand-alone film).  The first two have PLENTY of weight and story to be complete films/mini-series.  And HAS TO be better than a lot of the drivel being forced on us by Hollywood right now (I'm looking at you Twilight, Hunger Games, Percy Jackson, Titans, etc)…

 Considering they already have 3 of the 5 Middle Earth Quest heroes in this game, the completionist in me needs them to make the other two characters as heroes for this game as well. I'd like to see Eometh and Argalad.

I think your wish will easily be granted. I own the MEQ despite not liking and having not played in a long time, from the names though I think I remember Eometh is Rohan and Argalad Silvan, right? I believe there will be shortage especially for Silvan characters, thus we might see this guy soon.

Detouring the thread again, I really wonder what the approach for the Silvan shall be. What will be their strength? I think they may be a little more attack and less threat reduction oriented than Noldor. I mean more Lore and Tactics and little Spirit perhaps?

argalad sounds more like a dunedain name to me……..as for the silvan id like to see some sort of 'camouflage' keyword that allows them to pick off enemies in some cool new way, or looking at it the other way, they cannot be damaged by treachery or card effects, but at the same time they cannot defend (meaning they stay secret)

## 82 [lleimmoen on July 9, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/66475-non-canon-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=655853)

I am not really good with the names (etimology or linguistic behind them anyways) but I believe in MEQ Argalad really was an Elf from Woodland Realm.

I would really like a camouflage keyword, sounds superb and thematic for the Elves.

## 83 [richsabre on July 9, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/66475-non-canon-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=655868)

how about

camouflage

characters with camouflage are immune to treachery cards and cannot defend or commit to a quest

## 84 [jjeagle on July 9, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/66475-non-canon-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=655873)

I believe that Argalad means "royal tree" in Sindarin, so it is a perfectly plausible name for a (noble/royal) Elf of the Woodland Realm.

It looks a bit like a Dunedain name because the royal line of the kings of Arnor and the Chieftain of the Dunedain, also named in Sindarin, had the "Ar" or "Ara" prefix signifying royalty on all their names (Aragorn, Arathorn, etc).

Yes, I would love something along those lines. Perhaps cannot be damaged during Staging and Combat? To also avoid some general shadow effects? The bit about not being able to quest or defend (but could still attack) is especially neat.

One of the really REALLY difficult things to convey about the story, especially in a visual medium like film, is the power and menace that is manifest in a tiny little inanimate object.

 

 

I would have to disagree with this a bit.  There was always that whiney-schreechy sound effect when the ring was exerting its influence over someone.  That was a pretty good indication that something was going on.  Now, if one were deaf and watching the movie, yeah, that concept would be a significant obstacle to overcome.

A storyteller needs more tools in his box than just sound effects. 

I'm not even sure what you're suggesting here…that Jackson just shouldn't have employed said "whiney-schreechy" sound with Faramir? That wouldn't make much sense within the logic of the movie.

Either there is an opportunity for Faramir to get corrupted by the Ring or there is not. If there is no opportunity then there is pretty much no point to him meeting Frodo at all. If there is, but Faramir can just hand wave it away, then the ring come across as easily dismissible which then makes the struggle of all the other characters who have had to resist the ring seem really odd.

Even Galadriel they had to show being momentarily tempted to take the Ring. Having Faramir brush it off when neither his brother nor the elf-queen could would have been really odd and felt inconsistent in terms of the much-vaunted lure of the Ring. Gollum doesn't follow Frodo all across Middle-Earth just because he thought the Ring matched his ratty loincloth.



It is certainly the first; the opportunity for Faramir to be corrupted DID exist.  However, the way I read the text was that his Numenorian (sp?) heritage helped him resist the ring's power.  The fact that he was more Numenorian than his brother gave him strength against the ring's influence, whereas Boromir faltered.  In the case of Galadriel, my impression was that she was particularly vulnerable due to her possession of one of the three elven rings.

As for Gollum, gold rings are fine accessories for ANY attire!  (even ratty loincloths)  :-)

well as for gollum he was bascially hobbit, an hobbits had a particularly good resistance to magic and evil, hence frodo bearning the burdan through all the trials of the trilogy
