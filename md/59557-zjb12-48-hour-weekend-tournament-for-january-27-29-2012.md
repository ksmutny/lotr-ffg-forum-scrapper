## 1 [Zjb12 on January 26, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59557-zjb12-48-hour-weekend-tournament-for-january-27-29-2012/?do=findComment&comment=585006)

Hi!  Welcome to this weekend's Zjb12 48 Hour Quest.  This tournament begins at 5pm (CST/FFG time) Friday, January 27 and runs through Sunday, January 29, 5pm.  (Please do not include scores from times before or after that period.)

 

2 Part Quest: Over the Hills and Through the Woods to Grandpa Radagast's House We Go:  The Hills of Emyn Muil & A Journey to Rhosgobel (in that order)

Hero Pool: 1 of your 3 Heros must include either the warrior or dunedain trait.  You can only use heros from the core set and/or the following aps: Hunt for Gollum, Conflict at the Carrock, Journey to Rhosgobel, Hills of Emyn Muil.

Deck Pool/Off limit Cards:  Your deck pool may include cards from 1 Core Set, and 1 of each of the following aps: Hunt for Gollum, Conflict at the Carrock, Journey to Rhosgobel, Hills of Emyn Muil.  NOTE: If you are use to playing with cards from more than 1 core set, you might want to go back and check to make sure which cards had 1, 2, or 3 copies in the core set.  Or check, www.lotrlcg.com   There are no off limit cards as long as they come from this pool.  Again, only 1 core set.

Deck Size: 50 cards, no more, no less.  No changes in your heros or deck are allowed between the two quests since they constitute a complete game.  (Hero and Deck changes are allowed between game attempts.)

Encounter Decks:

The Hills of Emyn Muil Encounter Deck: Set up the Hills of Emyn Muil Encounter Deck as normal, but with this one change:  Do not use Dol Guldur Orcs.  Instead use Wilderlands.  Shuffle and run the game as normal except for this one change.

A Journey to Rhosgobel:  Set up A Journey to Rhosgobel Encoutner Deck as normal, but with this one change:  Do not use Dol Guldur Orcs.  Instead use Passage Through Mirkwood.  Shuffle and run the game as normal except for this one change.

Play:  We find our heros lost, dazed and confused from too much sun and not enough to eat.  Enemies are lurking in the hills and they long for escape northward.

Start out with Hills of Emyn Muil and play, making sure to acquire the 20 VPs needed, (you will find a few old foes who might help in this regard!) and the 1 progress token on the quest card.

As soon as you meet the requirements for the Emyn Muil quest card, freeze your half of the table.  Pick up the Emyn Muil encounter deck, clear out the quest card and active location; clear out the staging area and any enemies you are engaged with.  Touch nothing, do nothing with your heros, allies etc., unless you have an attachment on an enemy or location, (like ancient mathom, forest snare---if so, just discard these into your discard pile). 

You have made it out of the hills finally, but immediately upon leaving them, you find Wilyador damaged and needing (once again) to see his old buddy Radagast.  Put in the Journey to Rhosgobel encounter deck using the ap's setup on quest card 1A.  Make sure to follow the damage and healing rules!

Continue on in the phase in the round exactly where you left off with Emyn Muil as if just turning over one quest card to another.  There is NO reset of any type for the player's deck, heros, etc.

Scoring:  Tabulate your score per standard FFG rules and FAQ 10/31/11.  I will be using the scoring idea that is noted in a post by Juicebox called Measuring Success to acquire a weighted average.

Here's an idea of scoring with 5 attempts, L=loss;  90/L/85/79/L/.  Average score: (90+85+79)/3= 254/3 = 84.67

Win ratio: 5/3 = 1.67

Weighted would be 84.67 * 1.67 = 141.40 (rounded to nearest hundredth.)  This seems like a heavy penalty for losses, but the less losses you have, the penalty lessens, and with no losses, your average score is your weighted score.

Everyone is to play five games so we can have a fair comparison.  You can send in your scores 1 at a time or all together.  I will determine your win ratio factor once I have all your scores and wins and losses. 

When you post your scores please include: final  threat, damage, dead heros, rounds, and victory points, and heros used, as well as final total.  (When including rounds, give the number of rounds as well as the calculated points).

At the end of the 48 hours I will post the overall results and placings.  Please post your results to this forum topic.  As scores come in I will try to keep a posted scorecard going!

[A game attempt is considered an attempt as soon as you draw your initial hand of 6 cards.  You may take 1 mulligan at the beginning of the game for your opening hand as per normal rules.] 

Questions?  Please ask!

 This may sound easier that it actually is.  I tried several variations of this: take wilyador with you from the beginning in emyn muil applying the two damage per round rule; all 3 Heros must have Dunedain or warrior; even thicker encounter decks; no protector of Lorien, galadrim's greetings or will of the west.  It hey all seems just a bit too hard and I didn't want last weekends fiasco all over again.  Trust me, the hill trolls in emyn muil and all the treacherous between these two scenarios, along with needing good questing and healing skills, will make this interesting!

This one seems veeeeeeeery interesting.

I'll be playing it this weekend for sure!

 Tried my deck to see if it´s able to beat the quests. Sadly I don´t think I´ll have the time to try this.

Played it once and it took me over an hour. Not to mention shuffling and building the quest deck. So 7 tries would likely take me 7 hours of playing.

I am not sure if I can spare that much time in just two days.

yea 7 is a lot... why not just make it 3?

 I had set it at 5.  It is longer, that's why I reduced it.

I think it was 12 or 13 rounds and a threat of 0 with no wounds and 23 victory points. But it was just to test my deck and I think I won´t use it. It´s far to vulnerable with those restrictions.

Heh heh heh!!!!  I was going to put an evil smiley face but apparently the software has now banned me from smiley face usage!

Double quest does have a lot of treacheries.  That's why I actually relaxed my restrictions.  I was going to make it that all 3 Heros had to have the warrior or Dunedain trait. Mbut when I was close to winning and then in 1 encounter card lost most of my side of the board, I went to bed realizing we have to open the hero pool up to include Eleanor and or denethor if people want them.

 The other interesting part was my vps---8/22 in the first half were from hill trolls.  When those buggers pop out, you're not use to them in emyn muil.  Then I think I had Rhosgobel plus something else in the second half, so if I would have won, I would have had like 26-30vps.

## 15 [muemakan on January 26, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59557-zjb12-48-hour-weekend-tournament-for-january-27-29-2012/?do=findComment&comment=585310)

 Tried a few more turns and did not even come close to winning. Already played for 3 hours now and didn´t find a deck to beat it.

I think you made it way to hard again. For Emyn Muil you have to quest like hell and use some cards to kill locations. But the Wilderlands add big nasty enemies. So you need to fight them. Then you go straight to Rhosgobel. If you didn´t have the resources or cards to reduce you threat, you will likely already have a high threat. Hopefully you have cards to heal Wilyador or else it can be over very soon. 

And why so many changes? Limiting the cards is one way. Then you have to play 2 completely  different quest in on go and if that´s not enough we have to deal with other cards then the quest was planed for and we could see 4 hill trolls if we are unlucky.....

 So your first game didn't beat it then?  Let me know.  I can still reannounce tomorrow morning if I need to with something different.  I have a meeting in just a few minutes.

 Played 6 times to try some decks. Won 2 out of 6 games. One game I had only one Hill Troll and one Warg to beat. In the other there were only a Marsh Adder and a Wolfrider to beat. I am not sure if I would get a good ratio if I´ll try it. 

Well, we´ll see....

Thanks for the feedback!  Sounds good!  I think I will leave it for now.

 Made one change to my Heros and did a run through this morning and won on the first time.  This won't count, but here's my score as an example:  glorfindel, Eleanor, theodred.  6 damage; 13 rounds (130); threat 21; vps 27!  Total: 130.

## 20 [Zjb12 on January 27, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59557-zjb12-48-hour-weekend-tournament-for-january-27-29-2012/?do=findComment&comment=585644)

 Played 3 more games to just run through it, went 1-2, so 2-2 overall this morning.  Second win was 2 damage, 37 threat, 11 rounds, (110), 28vps=121.  None of these count, just testing more.   Think this is all set to go.  Going to leave as is.  It is hard, but winnable.

## 21 [Memetix on January 27, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59557-zjb12-48-hour-weekend-tournament-for-january-27-29-2012/?do=findComment&comment=585706)

I really look forward to trying out these competitions and hybrid quests.

I'm pretty demoralised though, I tried this 3 times with different decks, sadly I only made it through to the Rhosgobel stages once and then I was on 48 threat and didn't draw any threat reduction to save me, so I'm zero wins out of 3.

It could be fun if I had another 10 hours to throw at the problem, but I don't this weekend.

It will be interesting to see feedback from those that do have the time. Good Luck...... you'll need it.

 Thanks, I am 3-3 for the day.  But of course they don't count.  It's a toughly, that's for sure.

Just won with my first try, but it was very close.

 

Heroes: Price Imrahil, Théodred, Glorfindel

Threat: 45

Damage: 18 (Théodred and Glorfindel died)

Rounds: 220

VP: 20

Result: 263

 

Théodred died early in the hills of Emyn Muil. That's why it took me 18 turns to made it through this adventure. Then I had to sacrifice Glorfindel to get Wilyador down to 5 HP so that my one Athelas could heal the eagle.

You going to give it a go then when it starts this weekend?  Just a few hours away!  My last score was overe 200 as well.  How come you didn't have at least 24vps, (20 from emyn muil and the 4 for Rhosgobel?)

So if you use Glorifindel ability to heal Eagle then Glorifindel is removed from the game(quest card rule 2b). So you dont put him in discard pile and his threat didn count to scores in the end of the game.

Did you healed Wilyador with Glorfindel? I believe 'removed from the game' isn't equal to 'dead'.

If so, your end result is 251! It's getting better after every post. haha

****, thanks y'all. For me "removing" always means dead(why did he leave us anyway when he's not dead?) Cool thing ,as Glorfindel had two damage on him (yep, it was Rockslide).

 

And yep, I forgot that my group was at Rhosgobel (Théodred made the notes gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]).

 

So, the total score is then 251.

 It looks like people are starting to figure out decks to beat it.  Go time is 2 hours away!  Looking forward to hearing some interesting stories with this one, (like the warg that attacked me several rounds in a row during emyn mui and then either didn't have a shadow effect or always drew the one that returned him to the staging area.  I think I finally just brought Gandalf in and killed him.  What an annoying pest!)

Btw, your go time is midnight here in Central Europe. You should probably consider to choose a time that is early Euro evening to have more players participating.

Good point.  I am still figuring all this out.  Maybe sometime between 10am - and noon here, would that be about 5pm - 7pm where you are?

P.s.  have you guys got khazad dum yet?  I was wondering about that for next week.

Right now it is almost 11 pm in Germany.

 

About Khazad-Dum: it's avialable on German Amazon since today. I should get it early next week. happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]

 

Btw, next my try was far better - 165 points. My biggest problem was an early Marsh Adder and the famous pairing Wargs/Goblin Sniper - of course with no shadow effect happening for four-five turns. Without Glorfindels (underestimated) ability my party would have been toast in midgame. Managed to get through Rhosgobel in 2 turns.

## 32 [Zjb12 on January 27, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59557-zjb12-48-hour-weekend-tournament-for-january-27-29-2012/?do=findComment&comment=585788)

 The hills are the toughest part.  If you can pick up a lore of imladris while in the hills, it really helps out in the next part.  You also have to come out of the hills not too banged up or with a treachery canceller.  I had one game where if I hadn't been able to cancel a treachery, I'd have lost about half my board.  Glorfindels healing ability is pretty key as well.

## 33 [leptokurt on January 27, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59557-zjb12-48-hour-weekend-tournament-for-january-27-29-2012/?do=findComment&comment=585834)

Ok, my first official score:

 

Heroes: Prince Imrahil, Théodred, Glorfindel

Threat: 47

Damage: 0

Dead Heroes: 0

Rounds: 190

Victory Points: 34

Result: 203

 

Beside 5x Eastern Crows I saw no enemies! OTOH I got one location after the other. Three times I travelled to the Highlands only to draw Impassable Chasm afterwards. Got 1x Rockslide and 2x Pursued by Shadows, the second one being the enocunter of my last turn during Emyn Muil, so thankfully almost everyone was questing (question: because Faramir used his ability, he wass not queting so I had to add one threat for him, right?). The Brown Lands and the East Bight also have been explored by my fellowship. Could have ended this 3-4 turns earlier, but I kept drawing Emyn Muil locations ( VP are: Amon Hen, Amon Lhaw, 2x East Wall, 2x North Stair, 1x Outer Ridge, Shores of Nen Hithoel, 4x Highlands, Rhosgobel).

Rhosgobel dealt me two treacheries (Festering Wounds and Swarming Insects). As I had 3x Lore of Imladris and tons of resources left, I could easily heal Wilyador and finsih this quest in 2 turns.

 @leptokurt---good job!  I kept getting the east bight earlier today---I think I went there like three times kuz of it and other card effects---ugh!

I hope so.

 

Another question that came up during my second unofficial quest: When Rauros Falls is the active location, am I allowed to use Daughter of the Nimrodel's action during the planning or resource phase? Or do I have to keep her ready to commit her to the quest?

 I have always been unclear on that too.  Maybe we should ask in a separate topic and see if someone knows.

 First official score: threat, 28; rounds, 14 (140); no damage or dead Heros; Heros were glorfindel, eleanor, theodred.   24 vps (Amon hen, lhaw, hill troll, outer ridge, 2x shores of nen hithoel, Rhosgobel).  Final score: 144.

 You do not have to keep her ready.  This text is more along the lines of "You must commit everyone you can to this quest."  She's not eligible to quest if she's been exhausted earlier in the round.

 

To sort of highlight this more clearly - suppose Rauros Falls is active and Gimli has "Caught in a Web" on him.  It's the refresh phase.  Do you have to spend the 2 resources to ready him so that he'll be good to go for the Quest Phase?  Of course not.  Same story here.

Preparation: I knew right away that I wanted to play Lore and Spirit for these scenarios. These two are my favorite spheres anyway (Lore > Spirit), but they are especialy well adapted to both Hills of Emyn Muil (Northern Tracker) and Journey to Rhosgopel (Lore of Imladris). It was also interesting to try playing with a single Core Set for a change, although I hope it doesn't become a standard restriction on "tournament-style" posts (after all, it's easy enough to make proxies if required). One of the most interesting aspects of this game was the switch of encounter decks in both quests: this gives the quest a fresh look and makes them feel a bit like "new" quests.

Deck building - Heroes: I knew I wanted Denethor for sure for his "peaking" ability. When playing solo, I always try to use him. I also decided on Eleanor as my Spirit hero, fearing some of the treacheries in these quests. I was left with finding a Warrior or Dunedain hero to complete the trio. I considered Beravor (Dunedain), but with a single Unexpected Courage in the deck, it wasn't that powerful. Also, I needed a quester hero since both Denethor and Eleanor would remained ready most of the time. So I chose Glorfindel. It was my first time playing with him ever except in 4 players game. He's a Warrior, has great stats and his healing ability could come in handy in JtR. I wasn't too worried about the starting threat with 27. In retrospect, I didn't use Eleanor's ability very often, and most of those times, I had A Test of Will in hand anyway. I would probably switch Eleanor for Eowyn as the quester and add Beravor as the Dunedain hero instead. The extra cards would probably have accelerated my play a bit.

Deck building - Player cards: It was also interesting to build from a more limited card pool. I wanted to include Feint at first, until I realized that Song of Battle was out of scope. I went with a Leadership splash for Sneak Attack and Steward of Gondor. I added in a Dunedain Warning to make Denethor an invincible defender and chose to try a Dunedain Cache since I didn't have any eagle nor ranged character. That wasn't a good choice in retrospect: I had not realized how little time would be spent on the JtR quest. Must have for Lore included Lore of Imladris (to heal Wyliador) and Rivendell Minstrel to fetch the two Songs. I only played a single Gildor because of its high cost and I didn't want to find myself stuck with multiple copies of this unique ally. Spirit included the basics: Norther Tracker (star of the deck and a winning condition against THoEM), A Test of Will, The Galadhrim's Greetings, Dwarven Tomb (mostly to replay a GG before winning) and Ancient Mathom as my drawing engine (combines well with Erebor Hammersmith). I only included a single Hasty Stroke since I already had 2 A Burning Brand.

Deck building - What would I change: Haldir wasn't that useful. By the time I had the 4 resources, I was often looking to play other cards (early, I would favor the Minstrel; late, I'd have a Gandalf). Longbeard Map-Maker didn't shine either: I rarely had the resources to make use of him anyway. Not sure what other allies would have been better, however... I could have used more than one The Riddermark's Finest: its ability was great against THoEM and I didn't have any way to recycle him. I should definitively have played the second Protector of Lorien. Ever Vigilant could also have been a good addition to maximize the turns where Gandalf showed. The Strider's Path didn't see much play; maybe Secret Paths would have produced better results against this scenario (the travel costs are not "expensive" in THoEM, as opposed to what we see in the Core quests.

The quests: If I can make one critic about the format and the quest, its that the second part was almost useless. I always completed Journey to Rhosgopel in 2 turns with Lore of Imladris in hand because by then, I had a full army. Also, because THoEM can be won via Northern Tracker (putting the last exploration marker on the last location in staging bringing you to over 20 vp), I often fell into the first round of JtR with a maximized questing army. Either using a different scenario as the first part (THoEM gives you a lot of time to build up your army, although the addition of Wilderlands encounters made for a great challenge) or forcing a bigger reset between the two quests (such as reseting threat, maybe keeping only up to two allies, or some such thing) would have been better.

Loss on the first try: This first game led me to reflect upon the thread about why people find certain quests difficult or easy. The "experience factor" was mentionned in that thread, and it's what cost me that first lost. I haven't played often against THoEM. I didn't realize how difficult it may be if you start struggling against a bunch of ever increasing locations. In that game, I found myself engaging an Orc Horse Thieve. I had a choice at one point of trapping it with Forest Snare or playing an ally. I chose to play an ally because at that point, the staging area included a single location (one of the starting Amon location). I defended easily with Denethor, but got Rauros Falls as a shadow card, so the orcs went back in staging. Next round, I got a new location in staging and the extra 3 from the Orc prevented me from making progress. I defended again, but got the same shadow effect. It did the same for a 3rd round in a row. By then, that Orc was mighty and since it never stayed engaged, I didn't get a subsequent chance to trap it. After Denethor died, I scooped. You bet that I immediately trapped these Thieves in subsequent games.

Winning strategy: My games followed the same patterns. I tried to find at least a cheap ally in my starting hand as much as possible. The songs were always played on Glorfindel, along with Steward of Gondor. Denethor got A Burning Brand and Dunedain Warning. Glorfindel got the other attachments: Protector of Lorien and Dunedain Cache. Self-Preservation went were needed, but it ended up being Glorfindel more often than not. The generic pattern was: struggle for the first 2 turns; start stabilizing the field; get Northern Tracker active and then I made progress. By the 6th to 8th turn, I generaly had full board control, knew what was coming and was adjusting in consequence. Gandalf was used for threat lowering most of the games; I may have used him once to kill a Goblin Sniper. I didn't fight many enemies: mostly Eastern Crows and Orc Horse Thieves. I trapped the bigger ones when they showed (kept a Hill Troll trapped for a full game after the valiant sacrifice of an Erebor Hammersmith). By the 4th and 5th game, I was beginning to not worry so much about threat and chose a few time to quest less than needed, taking a threat increase, but allowing me a bit of flexibility (killing an enemy, peeking at the deck to set up a good turn after). I knew that I would always get a few Gandalf in play along with a couple of Galadhrim's Greetings before the end. On the first turn, I always quested with all 3 heroes and any ally I had. That was always the biggest risk I took: meeting a Warg on turn 1 with a lucky shadow card could have destroyed my strategy. Most of the other enemies are over 30 to engage, so with 5 or 6 points of Willpower questing, I was safe. I always traveled to the Amon location that prevents playing Events first so as to try to clear it.

All in all, a nice "event" and I hope to see more about other people's deck choice and gameplay.

 Game 2: loss in the hills.  Game 3: miraculous comeback. In the hills, only to threat out in Rhosgobel right after I got Gandalf from the response on mountains of mirkwood!!!!   Argh!!!!  1-2 for the tournament.  Gonna need two wins tomorrow or my weighted average is going to be to the moon!!!  ( to the moon Alice!!!!)

 @sick_boy:  hey!  Thanks for the game review.  Sounds like you really enjoyed it!

## 43 [leptokurt on January 28, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59557-zjb12-48-hour-weekend-tournament-for-january-27-29-2012/?do=findComment&comment=585997)

Hurray, my second try went far better, although it was a bit boring. This time I got only one enemy (King Spider, first turn of Rhosgobel).

 

Before I give a small review I have a question for you:

I ended Emyn Muil by using Snowbourn Scout's ability during the planning phase to explore the Highlands which got me 20 VP. So how do I continue after switching to the Rhosgobel deck? Am I still in the planning phase of the same turn? Or do I have to move my round marker by 1 and start with the resource phase of the next round? I played it like I still was in the planning phase if the same round. If that's so, one should be careful when finishing Emyn Muil during the questing phase, because the basically loose one turn to explore stage 1B of Emyn Muil, adding two extra damage to Wilyador.

Strategywise this would mean that a player should hold back Snowbourn Scout or use Riddermark's Finest ability so he can finish Emyn Muil before starting the quest phase.

 

So, here's my second adventure:

 

Heroes: Prince Imrahil, Théodred, Glorfindel

Threat: 29

Damage: 0

Dead Heroes: 0

Rounds: 80

Victory Points: 24

Result: 85

 

The encounters were lots of locations (all of them with the Emyn Muil trait!), one Rockslide and some harmless treacheries. Fortunatly Rockslide happened during turn 2, so Glorfindel was able to heal all my heroes in time. I had Celebrían's Stone in my starting hand, which helped a lot. I also had Sneak/Gandalf, Haldir, Snowbourn Scout, 2x Westroad Traveller and Riddermark's Finest as allies during the game. Other attachments were Song of Travel, Dúnedain Quest and Unexpected Courage.

 

Victory points were: Amon Hen, Amon Lhaw, 2x Highlands, Rauros Falls, Eastwall, Shore of Nen Hithoel, Rhosgobel

Played this into the wee hours this morning.  I won 3 out of 5, but I actually think the heroes and deck I used should be able to win close to 100% of the time (maybe perhaps not with the best individual scores though).  My two loses were due completely to "brain farts" in my play (highlighted below) as opposed to issues with my heroes/deck - I blame it on playing until 1:30 in the morning while drinking wine steadily. 

Thanks for putting together the tourney - was fun, and actually a lot easier than I thought it would be.  If you got through the Hills, then Rhosgobel was trivial and over in 3-4 rounds due to the allies and attachments built up by then.  After playing, I think 5 games is a lot to cram into 48 hours - would recommend 3 games next time despite luck weighing a little more heavily with less games to average out an overall score.

Details below:

Heroes: Glorfindel, Eowyn, Denethor

Deck: I can send details if anyone is interested.  Was a spirit/lore heavy deck with a sprinking of the usual leadership suspects (Sneak Attack, Steward of Gondor, Faramir)

 

Game #1

Win - 162 points

Threat: 37

Dead Heroes: 0

Damage Remaining: 0

Victory Points: 25

Round Points: 150

 

Game #2

Win - 138 points

Threat: 32

Dead Heroes: 0

Damage Remaining: 0

Victory Points: 24

Round Points: 130

Game #3

Fail - ended Hills with threat of 47 and then lost a few turns later when it hit 50.  Hit a troll and had low threat so didn't really worry about killing him, but then a second one popped up the next card and all of a sudden I had 2 to deal with and had not picked up a single Galadrin's Greeting.  Could have killed the first one easily if I had played a few cards differently but just didn't think I had to worry about threat as it was in the 20s when the first hill troll came up.

 

Game #4

Fail - really had a brain fart on this one.  It was the last turn on Rhosgobel and I had more than ennough will to finish the quest and an athleas to heal Willyador with an extra heal remaining from Glorfindel if needed.  I used Denethor to check the encounter deck and saw an Athleas card, could have moved it to the bottem of the deck as I didn't need it but left it.  Quested with all heroes (didn't need to) and then when I flipped the guard card it was **** festering wounds and nailed Wilyador for 2 additional damage (I could have handled 1 extra, but no, it had to be 2).  Had no ready heroes left to claim the Athleas, and ended up 1 short of healing Wilyador and lost the game.  Grrrrr.....

 

Game #5

Win - 198 points (of interest - did not use a single Lore of Imladris or Athleas)

Threat: 42

Dead Heroes: 12

Damage Remaining: 0

Victory Points: 36

Round Points: 198

Just read Sick_Boy's post and was intrigued by his deck so thought I would go ahead and post mine as it is similar, but there are some differences.  In hindsite I would replace Will of The West with Ancient Mathom - with 2 quests to play I thought I might run out of cards so added Will of the West, but in reality never needed to use it and what I needed more was a way to get at my Galadrim's Greeting and Lore of Imladris cards (one game they just refused to show up).

My decklist was:

Hero (3)
Denethor (Core) x1
Eowyn  (Core) x1
Glorfindel (Core) x1

Ally (23)
Daughter of the Nimrodel (Core) x3
Gandalf (Core) x3

Two more scores:

 

Third game: loss, thanks to Hill Troll in round 2 and Wargs in round 3

 

Fourth game:

 

Heroes: Prince Imrahil, Théodred, Glorfindel

Threat: 48

Damage: 0

Dead Heroes: 0

Rounds: 170

Victory Points: 30

Result: 188

 

Faced a Hill Troll and 2x Rockslide. Sacrificed a Miner of the Iron Hills to the troll and trapped him afterwards with Forest Snare. Rhosgobel was won thanks to Glorfindel healing ability and 1x Lore of Imladris (switched to Rhosgobel during the quest phase, so Willy had 6 damage to heal).

 Wow!  After going 4-5 yesterday, I start off this morning getting my butt handed to me by a boat load of enemies.  Game 4: loss.  That makes me 1-3 for the tournament.  At least you can say I didn't rig it!!!  ;-)

Yes, Radaghast plus I removed Glorfindel from the game to use his 1 heal ability.  That is one of the reasons why the score for this game was higher than the rest.  I just could not for the life of me draw an LoI card during the Hills quest and was stalling for a long time to try to get one, but finally had Radaghast in play with 5 resource on him that I just moved on.

 Well, finally another win.  Threat, 43; 13 rounds (130); no damage or dead Heros; 29vps (hen, lhaw, hill troll; 2x rauros falls; east wall of rohan; outer ridge; Rhosgobel.). Final score: 144.  Wow, my weighted average is going to be bad!!!

Lost my last attempt. I learned it the hard way why they didn't use the Wilderland encounters in Emyn Muil - you have almost zero chance to get rid of those Wargs. I got two of them and never had a single chance to attack them (the only shadow effect being "put the enemy back into the staging area"). This game left me quite frustrated as I did draw only useless cards both from the player and the enocunter deck - and still stood my ground for a long time. Then I got the Marsh Adder. Then Brown Lands. Loosing two games of five against this setup is quite disappointing, as I chose my heroes for a good win/loss ratio (and for not having that cursed spirit sphere).

 

The soring game itself is still very luck depending, as playing five games only is by far not enough to get a balanced score.

So, would it (not this weekend, but another time) be better to simply show wins and losses with average score next to it?  And which trumps which?  Say with my results, I went 2-3, average 144 per win.  So I would be .400 while sick boy was 4-1 (i think) and don't have his scores in front of me, but let's say 130 average.  So he'd be .800 with a win average of 130.  If you kept cumulative over tournament cycles, these numbers would change enough to start separating players and wins as well as score totals would matter wouldn't they?  (or is my head deluded kuz of my cold?)

The soring game itself is still very luck depending, as playing five games only is by far not enough to get a balanced score.

 

 

So, would it (not this weekend, but another time) be better to simply show wins and losses with average score next to it?  And which trumps which?  Say with my results, I went 2-3, average 144 per win.  So I would be .400 while sick boy was 4-1 (i think) and don't have his scores in front of me, but let's say 130 average.  So he'd be .800 with a win average of 130.  If you kept cumulative over tournament cycles, these numbers would change enough to start separating players and wins as well as score totals would matter wouldn't they?  (or is my head deluded kuz of my cold?)



 

I think the system works fine, but the more games you play, the less luck is involved. If you look at my five games, I was pretty lucky in one of them and was very very very unlucky in another. Five more games, with the option of not counting the worst and the best result would be better, but that's probably too time intensive. That's why I am looking forward to a living tournament (but then it's more tense when you play only for a couple of days).

All in all I think I had a lot of fun, the only thing I'd change is to remove the Wargs, but that's a minor detail in an overall ggerat looking picture. happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]

 In my warm up games yesterday I had the same problem with the wargs and also had some games where the hill troll kept getting the return to the staging area as well.  I still like your idea of trying a quest where you look to score points by going places and killing enemies.

My aim is to build a scoring system in which the spirit sphere becomes completly useless. gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]

 

Perhaps in your next tournament you could follow the suggestion that someone made not to score the heroes threat, and damage but only the rounds and VP. A spirit deck would then look less bombastic.

But I think I would want to score round points at something a lot less than 10, otherwise it doesn't seem worth it.

Plus Will of the West to reshuffle (and immediatly redrawing) these cards into the player deck. He always plays that deck. Surprisingly this works in approximately 100 percent of the games in which one tries this, even with only one coreset. Have to try this out myself.

Seems like it's very difficult to build a deck and employ a strategy that wins 100% of the time....I don't believe anyone has done it for this tourney yet.  Do you think playing solo there will always be cases where the draws from the encounter deck are so bad that there is no defense?  I'm curious what type of win % an expert player could generally expect to get versus the different difficulty scenarios?

Against this scenario I'd consider a win ratio of 80 percent as good. There are some encounters that can ruin the game for you when they appear early in the game - 2x Rockslide, a Hill Troll , 2x Wargs, Wargs/Goblin Sniper, East Bight/Brown Lands. Most of these can be countered, but early in the game you have to be lucky to have all the cards (= Gandalf in most cases)  that can help you.

I'm tempted to try again, but I just can't afford to stay up until 2 AM again tonight.  I think if I dropped a few of the cards I never ended up using for some additional ones with card draw capabilities and perhaps swapped Eoywn for Beravor I might be able to do significantly better....ahh well, maybe next time.  I always underestimate the power of additional card draws...

 RGun---u could, but it wouldn't count towards the tournament.  I don't think I changed my deck at all even though I went 2-3.  I am glad to see some people could be ptty successful.  It means it was not horrifically hard like last week!

Muemakan: Do you think you could post your full decklist?

I find your results very impressive in getting to 0 threat systematicaly. My games lasted a similar number of rounds as yours (11 to 16), but for you to take a starting theat of 27 and bring it down to 0 each time, you need to play a lot of Gandalf and/or GG. That's at least 6 or 7 play of either one per game, with only two Sneak Attack, two GG and a Dwarven Tomb. I understand Theodred accelerates your resources production so you can play Gandalf more often than I did, but that still sounds like a lot. Were you getting through your whole deck every time with Beravor's card drawing (I only had Gleowine and Ancient Mathom, so I wasn't going that fast, but I did come close to drawing the whole deck once).

I know it sounds like I'm doubting it, and maybe there's a part of it, but since I'm all for milking every last drop of score you can when playing, I'm also really interested to see if there's a strategy I'm missing here or something.

Also, in order to get that many victory points, were you using or not using Northern Tracker in the HoEM portion? For me, every time I had the Tracker, I was bound to finish the game very close to the 20 vp mark (plus getting the additional 4 from Rhosgopel) because Tracker cleaned the last locations while they were still in staging.

I tried muemakan's approach myself. I played only Emyn Muil with the Wilderland deck, was too lazy to put the Rhosgobel deck together, but I can promise you that it would have taken me only one more round to finish.

The result was: 12 rounds, 0 damage, 0 threat, 20 VP, 90 points

 

I think I got Unexpected Courage in round 4 or 5. The trick is to draw your whole deck, play 2x GG, 2x Sneak/Gandalf, 3x Gandalf. That lowers your threat by 37 points (I didn't even use Dwarven Tomb). In the meanwhile you draw your whole player deck, so that in the discard pile you only have the above mentioned cards plus a handful of other cards. Then you play Will of the West, and you can draw 5 cards each round from a deck that has only around 10 cards, so in 2 turns you have all those threat lowering cards in your hand again.

This deck is indeed a no brainer. You only have to survive the first two rounds (I had Henamarth in my starting hand who warned me twice that there was a Rockslide coming), and you have to get UC and SoG as son as possible.

 

Here is my deck list:

 

2x Northern Tracker

1x Éomund

3x Escort from Edoras

1x Unexpected Courage

3x Ancient Mathom

2x Galadrim's Greeting

2x Will of the West

2x Test of Will

 

2x Faramir

3x Snowbourn Scout

2x Steward of Gondor

1x Celebrían's Stone

3x Mark of the Dúnedain

1x Grim Resolve

2x Sneak Attack

Here´s my deck. Normally I have a Horn of Gondor so I don´t have to pay for sneaking. Theodred was used instead. The only way to do it with this deck is to draw your whole deck, and then draw another third of your already discarded deck to get your discard pile empty. 

I had one Tracker. He is very helpful in getting rid of a lot of locations at once........so they all count for victory points.

 

Heroes:

Eowyn, Beravor and Theodred

 

Spirit: 22

3 Westfold Horsebreaker

3 Stand and Fight

2 GG

2 Ride to Ruin

2 Riddermarks Finest

3 Old Mathom

2 Will of the West

1 Unexpected Courage

1 Northern Tracker

1Dwarven Tomb

1 A Test of Will

1 Hasty Stroke

 

 

Leadership: 12

1 Celebrians Stone

2 Vailiant Sacrifice

2 Sneak Attack

2 Common Cause

2 SoG

1 Daughter of Nimrodel

1 Erebor Hammersmith

Thanks for posting the decklist.

"Drawing your whole deck" is the part I was not clearly realizing in your strategy. I should have seen it, having played similar decks before.

I may give a try to that deck. It's been a while since I played 3 heroes from different spheres.

Okay, so the final tally is below!  Same as at the halfway point!  I think switching to normal length quests next weekend and perhaps 2 differing ones, we can draw in some more players!  Good job to all those who got invovled!  Thanks for trying it out and all your feedback! 

Place     Name             Scores                      W-L   Weighted Factor   Weighted Score

1.           Meumaken     87/97/155/105/L       4-1     1.25                      138.75   

2.           Sick_boy        L/128/163/109/135   4-1     1.25                       167.19

3.           Leptokurt        203/85/L/188/L         3-2     1.67                       264.97

4.           RGun             162/138/L/L/198       3-2      1.67                       277.22

5.            Zjb12             144/L/L/L/144          2-3       2.50                      360.00


 

Congrats again to Meumaken and Sick-boy for gong 4-1!!!  Leptokurt and RGun, also good job at 3-2!  And who is that guy at the end there with the interesting looking scorecard?!?  The same guy who along with his hobbits just got his butt handed to him by the Nameless Fear in Khazad-Dum!

Let me know your thoughts on the scoring system too!

P.S. In order for Meumaken to go 3-0 against my tournaments, next week he has to overcome his battle with the forum software and have no blank posts!!!

All this combo was already discovered long time before. Even before the changed of scores system to add 10 points every round.

If you use it on Nightmare mode you also can choose your strarting hand between quests. This is most crazy powerful!! That why i always say Will of the west Beravur should be ban or get some errata.

I remember the time when i sue to play Lotr tcg from Decipher. That game also use to have unlimited crazy draw form begin. But after first expansion was release people start to make crazy combo, designers invent rules of 4: you cannot draw more then 4 cards in 1 round. So i think our game maybe also need some kind of draw limit or Rule discard card in the end of the round. Or maybe make a rule for encounter deck cose i think encounter deck should to react on your hand size.

Well, I knew about this combo for a long time, but sometimes you only believe in something when you experienced it yourself. To be fair, if you only use one UC there's still no winning guarantee , but this kind of deck still would score far better results on average then any other.

IMO it would be enough to restrict Beravor's ability the same way as Glorfindel's - once per turn.

To avoid card draw becoming to powerful for tournaments all we have to do is ban Will of the West if we don´t want Deck like this one or the Zigil Miner.

It's not only the threat reducement (btw, I still favour the idea of not counting threat/damage for a result), but also the combo with PoL. Beravor, 3x UC, 3x PoL, and you never have to worry about questing again (so the rest of your deck can handle battle and treacheries). And even without WotW, one is able to reduce his threat to a minimum. I would have ended my game try with this deck with a threat of ~10 points without WotW.

Yes Protector is also very powerful. Should to have limit : for example no more then x cards to discard or something.

Beravur even with errata(once per round) still very powerful but actually all those things is easy to change to make UC unique or errata: limit one per hero.

Will of the west in my opinion even with errata( after you play it remove it from the game instead put it to discard pile) still to powerful so i vote for BAN this card out of the game forever!

Tracker should t have errata in my opinion : choose 1 location on staging area and put 1 progress token on this location.

There is also shoud to be some limit  how many cards you can draw per round. In MTG is quite simple and effective you can draw how much you want but in the end of the turn you should to discard until you have hand size (7cards).

In 2 players game those rules if they will be added by FFG  make sessions much more interesting and harder and more balanced with power of encounter decks.

The encounter deck should to react more on the players actions in the game. KD is right move but still not enough........

Glaurung: I don't think we'll see all the errata you suggest. The main reason is that those cards were designed as part of the Core set and served to establish the basis upon which all the game mechanics were balanced.

I'm pretty sure they keep Northern Tracker in mind when assigning value to locations, for example. They can assume players will have 2 Trackers at a time (from a single Core set), so any location with a cost of 2 or less to explore could have a major travel cost associated; players have ways to bypass it. However, once a location gets to 3 or more, you know it probably means at least 2 turns of Tracker questing; it's a different issue.

As for the whole concept of drawing your full deck and reshuffling only a limited number of events (such as Sneak Attack and Gandalf, guaranteeing a quick recycling once your deck is in your hand), I agree it's a powerful strategy and I'm not sure they fully thought it through. Would it warrant as many errata as you suggest (Beravor, Protector of Lorien, Will of the West)? I don't know. But there are other consequences to such changes that need to be considered. For example, if you force players to discard at the end of their turn for having more than X cards in hand, you increase the strength of a card such as Stand or Fight. Limiting Beravor's ability doesn't sound too bad, but other options could have been considered instead (such as making her starting threat higher, like it was done with Bilbo).

If we knew the form that organized play will take once they implement it, it would help a lot in these kind of debates... looks like it won't be for now (they announced Q1 organized play packages for the other LCG), but maybe before the summer...

he has been on about this like a broken record for a long time.. it is NEVER going to happen... EVER.

 

@Zjb12 Why not do some fun silly things.. like how about an event were the person with the most resources on a single character wins.. or who ever can finish the quest with teh most victory points wins... stuff like that more fun and out of left field.

I like the latter idea. And seriously, if we want to play tournaments then we have to do something about Beravor. I'd also like to have a quest cycle which is about rescuing Éowyn and Beravor from the hands of some evil sorcerer (so that you can't use both lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif]).

Will of the west and Beravur should be ban or get some errata in the tourny system for 2 players.Also Protector of Lorien is to powerful on this format.

With KD new Locations yes Tracker lose some advantage for now but in SOM cycle he is still too powerful.

I dont even talk about Miner ( i dont really understand how designers can make this card either) but they already change some ruels 2 times from first FAQ to Scond FAQ. So it mean they by them self not really  understand where they going........

Let me remind you 1 thing which is quite typical for all kind of card game like TCG,LCG,CCG. The first set (in our case is core set) is always  most powerfull and unbalanced. Most of the time many cards from the first sets get ban or Restricted (MTG, LOTR Decipher TCG).

Cose there is no other way to make game balanced except erratas, Ban and with time think more careful when you make new cards.But mistake can be heal only by erratas or Ban. It happens before and it will be happens again. You dont nee to be Expert in this game to understand Beravur and Will of the West+Protectoe of Lorien is Crazy powerful cards which is destroy all balance ( in 2 and more players game not for solo) completely.

I wouldn't count on it, Booooored. I think Glaurung's got a good point. History tends to repeat itself.

I wouldn't be surprised if we saw this happening at some point. I'm not afraid for Protector of Lorien (I don't agree with Glaurung; if the card draw is limited somehow, it becomes a less powerful card, at least on par with Longbeard Map-Maker) or Will of the West (at most, it could be errated that Will of the West itself is removed from the game after resolving instead of put in your discard pile). but Beravor could be errated (I don't think they'll "attack" Unexpected Courage because it was restricted in the Core set and we have Fast Hitch in 3 copies which does the same and hasn't been considered a problem yet).

But not anytime soon; certainly not until we have a tournament scene and even then, only after certain strategies prove to dominate the format.

 What if we had this rule in a tournament format, "after playing an event card, instead of placing it in the discard pile, remove it from play.". This would be similar to healing cards used in journey to Rhosgobel.  It would also toughen up play a little bit as you would know you are limited to how many times you could use certain cards.

Boored you have very good point: This will never happen! Why? Cose it cannot happen ever! Very good argument. What i can say about it....?

Maybe all what really game need is really just limit draw per round by some rules??? Maybe then game will dont need any erratas?

In my opinion with KD release game is quite good balanced for solo game. And look on Next cycle preview materials sounds like it will be ok on this way.

But what about co-op play? Then we come to point when you have 2 players and each play spirit/ Leadership/Lore you have 6 test of will, 6 Hasty stroke, 6 Sneak attack and 6 Gandalf +6 G greetings.Forget 6 UC as well. From certain point (normaly is after 3-4 first rounds) there is no point to play anymore Cose with Crazy Beravur Draw you can Cancel all Revealed effects, Shadow effects, Remove threats and Play Gandalf every round like a devil from Tabaco box.. In My opinion i quite boring! The rest of the game is just a matter of time cose you understand you win anayway! You know encounter deck and you already can see is done.

In my opinion this is most bad moment in this game.The game is just starting there is long session ahead but you already know you win! So what the point to play if you know this. From this moment you can start new game already. Very stupid moment!And this is not even the middle of the session. is Just a beginning!

So in my opinion the rules for co-op game definitely need some erratas or changes.

What i do usually when we play with my firend to make game more difficult? I remove from encounter decks  some cards. When we play Carrock i remove Grimbeorn and Locations. When we play KD i remove Torch and Books. But if you compare KD and SOM sure KD is much more harder and more Interesting to play cose there is a lot of Surge effect and also KD have much more Random elements.
