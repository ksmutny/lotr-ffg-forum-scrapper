This is probably obvious, but I wanted to be sure.

When the text on a card says (using Anfalas Herdsman, for example) something like "Each Outlands character you control gets +1 hit point" does that +1 hit point apply to the card with that text as well? So, by default, the Herdsman would have 2 hit points, not the 1 printed on the card?

Thanks!

Great, thanks! That's the way I've been playing it.
