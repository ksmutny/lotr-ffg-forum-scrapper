The Road returns as we continue through The Two Towers.

Frodo and Sam have made it across the Anduin, with Faramir of Gondor escorting them as they near his homeland. But there are other forces at work here, for Sauron ever searches for the One Ring, dispatching his Nazgul once again to locate it. Meanwhile Denethor sends his own agents to escort his errant son back to Minas Tirith along with such a mighty gift. And something from the past has emerged, intent on reclaiming their Precious.

`Yes, yes,' said Gollum. `All dead, all rotten. Elves and Men and Orcs. The Dead Marshes. There was a great battle long ago, yes, so they told him when Sm√©agol was young, when I was young before the Precious came. It was a great battle. Tall Men with long swords, and terrible Elves, and Orcses shrieking. They fought on the plain for days and months at the Black Gates. But the Marshes have grown since then, swallowed up the graves; always creeping, creeping.'

Here is the narrative for my Saga Campaign playthrough of Passage of the Marshes. Hope you guys enjoy!
