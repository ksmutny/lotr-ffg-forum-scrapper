Thought this would be a cool thread idea... Tolkien lore question and answer ... this isnt me answering lore questions (my knowledge or arrogance doesnt run so deep :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]) but for the whole forum... if you wonder something on LOTR or related material, ask, and the forum shall answer (hopefully :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png])

 

Giants... what exactly were they? i mean, we have trolls which are corruptions of ents, orcs are corruption of elves, wargs i assume (?) are corruptions of wolves...  but giants are only mentioned once and in the hobbit..and as far as i know tolkien never returns to them, or their alliegance in LOTR..we only know they at least help him periodically block up goblin cave entrances

 

so perhaps, if they arent of 'evil' then they are creatures in their own right... but i dont remember a reference to them in the creation of creatures in silmarillion.

 

any ideas?

Richard

Well, at least they exist so they can be used as encounter cards. Or maybe even player cards (never gonna happen ofc) :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Great idea!

 

In my opinion at least PJ depicted them as they are not. I don't think they are actually made of stone, but rather the word Stone-giants means that they live high up in the mountain, like Cave Troll, which are also not made of caves. But I guess they are just some mindfling of Tolkien that he thought was nice to put in at the moment he wrote it, but propably forgot about it later on. (as with many things) I see them more as Ents, "We are on nobody their sides", creatures who have no alliances with anybody, save for maybe the Eagles. Instead of the Ents, these Giants don't get roused, so probably only killed some annoying Goblins in the mountains.

great thoughts :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] i tend to agree (which echoes my thoughts on your post about skin changers ..which actually gave me the idea for this thread)

 

it does make me wonder on that note, why sauron ignored such a valuable assest he could have used (it appears to me at least they werent sophisticated and could have been brought under his control easy enough in time)

I think it's always important to remember that The Hobbit when it was written originally wasn't intended to be part of Tolkien's broader legendarium. So he probably included giants in The Hobbit because they fit the "fairy tale" quality of that particular story, but didn't necessarily have a part for them in the broader history of Middle-earth. Of course, Tolkien did like to reconcile certain discrepancies in his work, so it's surprising that he never touched on giants more at some later point. Of course, I haven't read every last piece of Tolkien (the histories of Middle-earth are still waiting for me), so it's possible that the answer lies in there somewhere, but I haven't heard of it. 

## 7 [Raven1015 on November 2, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126151-tolkien-lore-q-a/?do=findComment&comment=1319076)

Since this is the place to ask a question, I guess I'll ask, How much foresight do you think Gandalf had? There are plenty of examples of him making decisions and believing in people when no one else would, and he always seemed to turn out right. Taking a bet on one little Hobbit named Bilbo dramatically changed the course of events, as without Bilbo, the Dwarves would likely have been eaten by Spiders, ended up locked up forever in Thranduil's halls, etc., and the dragon would still have been alive during the War of the Ring. Another example is him insisting on Merry and Pippin's presence in the Fellowship, which seemed absurd at the time, but they went on to play key roles in victory.

 

So did Gandalf just really believe in people, especially the smallest and humble of peoples like Hobbits, and he was able to inspire them to the greatest heights? Or, due to his Maia nature, did he have foreknowledge of the future?

 

This isn't necessarily a question that can be answered, I realize, but perhaps is more of a philosophical destiny vs. free will type question.

I hope the answer not be about the Maia nature and knowledges about future. It would become boring...

## 9 [gandalfDK on November 2, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126151-tolkien-lore-q-a/?do=findComment&comment=1319160)

Hmmm good question Raven1015..

I tend to answer the question with another 'Why would an Istari/Maia not have foresight?'. He is not of Mankind, and although magic has no role as 'magic' in ME, he has powers, great powers.

But, if I would try to answer, I think not really. IMO he just does what hr thinks is right and as he says about Bilbo 'he gives me courage'. Gandalf took strenght out of the small, simple deeds, so perhaps he was inspired by Merry and Pippins love and friendship with Frodo and saw a strong bond between them, so he insisted on them joining.

On the other hand, he seems to know a lot of things already before they are reported to him. Frodo not being dead, Denethor mad. And with things of the Hobbit all the same..

Or maybe it was the Pipeweed. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

## 10 [Estel Edain on November 2, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126151-tolkien-lore-q-a/?do=findComment&comment=1319200)

When the three hunters meet Gandalf in Fangorn, we get his perspective on a few things. When he learns that Sam accompanied Frodo, he says, "It is news to me, yet it does not surprise me. Good! Very good! You lighten my heart." When he hears of Boromir's death, he answered, "Poor Boromir! I could not see what happened to him. ...But he escaped in the end. I am glad. It was not in vain that the young hobbits came with us, if only for Boromir's sake."

 

He then speaks of their peril: " 'War is upon us and all our friends, a war in which only the use of the Ring could give us surety of victory.' ... He rose and gazed out eastward, shading his eyes, as if he saw things far away that none of them could see. Then he shook his head. 'No,' he said in a soft voice, 'it has gone beyond our reach. Of that at least let us be glad. We can no longer be tempted to use the Ring."

 

Finally he speaks to Aragorn's seemingly useless choice to attempt rescuing Merry and Pippin: "You chose amid doubts the path that seemed right: the choice was just, and it has been rewarded. For so we have met in time, who otherwise might have met too late."

 

It seems clear that Gandalf sees more than others, yet much remains hidden to him. He has a sense of what is right in different circumstances, and for the rest he trusts to fate, like he tells Bilbo at the end of the Hobbit: "Surely you don't disbelieve the prophecies, because you had a hand in bringing them about yourself? You don't really suppose, do you, that all your adventures and escapes were managed by mere luck, just for your sole benefit? You are a very fine person, Mr. Baggins, and I am very fond of you; but you are only quite a little fellow in a wide world after all!"

 

This fits with Tolkien's idea of eucatastrophe. Gandalf seems helpless in the Battle of the Five Armies, ready for a last blast of magic, and then the Eagles come. I don't think he has clear foresight, but he's open to allowing fate to work, rather than trying to account for everything in the designs of the wise.

## 11 [Raven1015 on November 2, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126151-tolkien-lore-q-a/?do=findComment&comment=1319253)

Great answer, Estel Edain! That pretty much aligns with  my own thinking: he has some measure of foresight, but not total knowledge (and I agree with you too, Mndela, that if total knowledge were the case, it would be boring!). I like how this contrasts with Saruman. Saruman did not have faith in others, and so he sought total knowledge and total foreknowledge, even at the cost of dabbling in the arts of the Enemy. Gandalf, by contrast, seems to hold onto hope and be willing to leave some matters up to destiny and higher powers, making decisions based on his own wisdom and intuition rather than using something like the Palantir. At times, this makes it seem like he succeeded mostly on luck, but as referenced in that passage you quoted from the end of the Hobbit, it's more about faith in others and the ultimate triumph of good.

In the Book of Lost tales there are mentions on Giants, even names for them. Have read it only once and not own it so I don't remember much more. I also remember that there is a mention that Giants where created by Melcor. If any one has the book he might take a look

## 13 [richsabre on November 2, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126151-tolkien-lore-q-a/?do=findComment&comment=1319419)

thanks Nickpes, i dont have that book (yet) but ill look that one up

 

great answers on the gandalf foresight topic... as for my own thoughts, well i guess the short answer is i tend to agree with the idea he had at least some foresight into the happenings of middle earth

 

one thing always gets me though... what on earth was he intending to do when he got to mordor? this isnt ever touched upon and ive discussed this here before in one of my (long forgotten :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]) articles....when you total up the options (through the gate is unlikely, through cirith ungol even less likely, all the way around the mountain chains would have meant the war had ended) then im not sure what his plan was

 

my only thought is gandalf had seen some sort of foresight, of frodo inside mordor, and knew that somehow he got in there, but he did not know what.

## 14 [gandalfDK on November 2, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126151-tolkien-lore-q-a/?do=findComment&comment=1319623)

A couple of quotes that give to think about:
 

“It is not despair, for despair is only for those who see the end beyond all doubt. We do not.”
 

“For even the very wise cannot see all ends.” 

These two quotes suggested at least that Gandalf had some kind of foresight, but that he ´could not see all ends´, so it wasn´t any great power I think.
 

And again a hint of foresight:

 “You take after Bilbo,' said Gandalf. 'There is more about you than meets the eye, as I said of him long ago.' Frodo wondered if the remark meant more than it said.”

 

Especially about the Bilbo question:

"I'm looking for someone to share in an adventure, and it's very difficult to find anyone.' 
'I should think so, in these parts. We're plain, quiet folk and have no use for adventures. Nasty, disturbing, uncomfortable things, they make you late for dinner.” 

 

It has not so much to do with foresight, but 1. this could be a diversive tactic to lure Bilbo into the quest or 2. the 'very difficult' was true and Gandalf choose Bilbo rather by change than foresight.

 

About Gandalf's Folly:

 “Still that must be expected,' said Gandalf to himself. 'He is not half through yet, and to what he will come in the end not even Elrond can foretell. Not to evil, I think. He may become like a glass filled with a clear light for eyes to see that can.”

 

As I read it here, Elrond had more foreseeiing powers than Gandalf, but 'not even' would suggest that Gandalf had some himself.

GandalfDK, when you finally get your hands on Unfinished Tales, you're going to love it, if only for the chapter called The Quest of Erebor, in which Gandalf explains to the members of the Fellowship of the Ring after the War of the Ring how and why he came to push Thorin to take Bilbo on his expedition to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. Unfinished Tales contains excerpts from different drafts of the story. 

 

Gandalf admits to having some sort of "foresight," that he "feels it deep in his heart," that the quest will only succeed if Thorin takes Bilbo along… and this is based on Gandalf remembering having met Bilbo when he was a child, and on rumours he had heard about him while travelling through the Shire (at a time when Bilbo was away, "off again"), which made him sound promising to Gandalf. So he had not seen "adult Bilbo" yet when he insisted that Thorin take Bilbo with him (the Dwarves should take a Hobbit along, he argued, for Smaug would not recognize the scent of a Hobbit, whereas he would that of a Dwarf or other known enemies… and Gandalf supported the Dwarves' quest to reclaim Erebor and slay Smaug, for he feared that Sauron could make an ally of the dragon).

 

 

"I know your fame," Thorin answered. "I hope it is merited. But this foolish business of your hobbit makes me wonder whether it is foresight that is on you, and you are not crazed rather than foreseeing. So many cares may have disordered your wits."

 

 

In another draft, Gandalf answers questions about why he chose Bilbo for the quest to Erebor:

 

"And anyway you must begin at some point, with some one person. I dare say he was "chosen" and I was only chosen to choose him; but I picked out  Bilbo."

 

'How would you select any one Hobbit for such a purpose?' said Gandalf. 'I had not time to sort them all out; but I knew the Shire very well and by that time, although when I met Thorin I had been away for more than twenty years on less pleasant business. So naturally thinking over the Hobbits that I knew, I said to myself: "I want a dash of the Took" (but not too much, Master Peregrin) "and I want a good foundation of the stolider sort, a Baggins perhaps." That pointed at once to Bilbo. And I had known him once very well, almost up to his coming of age, better than he knew me. I liked him then. And now I found that he was "unattached" -- to jump on again, for of course I did not know all this until I went back to the Shire. I learned that he had never married. I thought that odd, though I guessed why it was; and the reason I guessed was not the one that most Hobbits gave me: that he had early been left very well by his own master. No, I guessed that he wanted to remain "unattached" for some reason deep down which he did not understand himself -- or would not acknowledge, for it alarmed him. He wanted, all the same, to be free to go when the chance came, or he had made up his courage. I remembered how he used to pester me with questions when he was a youngster about the Hobbits that had occasionally "gone off", as they said in the Shire. There were at least two of his uncles on the Took side that had done so."

 

 

So in the above excerpt, we see that Gandalf is a psychologist relying heavily on intuition, rather than definite foresight :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] … as confirmed by the following excerpt:

 

 

"'So I rode off back to Thorin in haste, to tackle the difficult task of persuading him to put aside his lofty designs [to take Erebor by force with a small army of Dwarves] and go secretly -- and take Bilbo with him. Without seeing Bilbo first. It was a mistake, and nearly proved disastrous. For Bilbo had changed, of course. At least, he was getting rather greedy and fat, and his old desires had dwindled down to a sort of private dream. Nothing could have been more dismaying than to find it actually in danger of coming true! He was altogether bewildered, and made a complete fool of himself. Thorin would have left in a rage, but for another strange chance, which I will mention in a moment."

 

With regards to the "mistake" that "nearly proved disastrous," Gandalf says:

 

"'It was on the morning of Tuesday, April 25th 2941, that I called to see Bilbo; and though I knew more or less what to expect, I must say that my confidence was shaken. I saw that things would be far more difficult than I had thought. But I persevered. Next day, Wednesday, April the 26th, I brought Thorin and his companions to Bag End; with great difficulty so far as Thorin was concerned -- he hung back to the last. And of course Bilbo was completely bewildered and behaved ridiculously. Everything in fact when extremely badly for me from the beginning; and that unfortunate business about the "professional third", which the Dwarves had got firmly in their heads, only made matters worse…"

 

Another relevant excerpt/explanation from Gandalf with regards to foresight/fate:

 

 

"In that distant time I said to a small and frightened hobbit [Frodo]: Bilbo was meant to find the ring, and not by its maker, and you therefore were meant to bear it. And I might have added: and I was meant to guide you both to those points.

"To do that I used in my waking mind only such means as were allowed to me, doing what lay to my hand according to such reasons as I had. But what I knew in my heart, or knew before I stepped on those grey shores: that is another matter. Olórin I was in the West that is forgotten, and only to those who are there shall I speak more openly."

 

 

In the essay on The Istari in Unfinished Tales, J.R.R. Tolkien writes:

 

 

Emissaries they [the 5 Istari] were from the Lords of the West, the Valar, who still took counsel for the governance of Middle-earth, and when the shadow of Sauron first began to stir again took this means of resisting him. For with the consent of Eru they they sent members of their own high order, but clad in bodies of Men, real and not feigned, but subject to the fears and pains and weariness of earth, able to hunger and thirst and be slain; though because of their noble spirits they did not die, and aged only by the cares and labours of many years. And this the Valar did, desiring to amend the the errors of old, especially that they had attempted to guard and seclude the Eldar by their own might and glory fully revealed; whereas now their emissaries were forbidden to reveal themselves in forms of majesty, or to seek to rule the wills of Men or Elves by open display of power, but coming in shapes weak and humble were bidden to advise and persuade Men and Elves to good, and to seek to unite in love and understanding all those whom Sauron, should he come again, would endeavour to dominate and corrupt […]"

 

"For it is said that being embodies the Istari had need to learn much anew by slow experience, and though they knew whence they came the memory of the Blessed Realm was to them a vision from afar off, for which (so long as they remained true to their mission) they yearned exceedingly. Thus by enduring of free will the pangs of exile and the deceits of Sauron they might address the evils of that time."

 

 

Christopher Tolkien remarks in the essay on The Istari:

 

"Most of the remaining writings about the Istari (as a group) are unhappily no more than very rapid jottings, often illegible. Of major interest, however, is a very brief and hasty sketch of a narrative, telling of a council of the Valar, summoned it seems by Manwë ('and maybe he was called upon by Eru for counsel?'), at which it was resolved to send out three emissaries to Middle-earth. 'Who would go? For they must be mighty, peers of Sauron, but must forgo might, and clothe themselves in flesh so as to treat on equality and win the trust of Elves and Men. But this would imperil them, dimming their wisdom and knowledge, and confusing them with fears, cares, and wearinesses coming from the flesh.' But only two came forward: Curumo [a.k.a. Saruman], who was chosen by Aulë, and Alatar [one of the Blue Wizards], who was sent by Oromë. Then Manwë asked, where was Olórin? And Olórin, who was clad in grey, and having just entered from a journey seated himself at the edge of the council, asked what Manwë would have of him. Manwë replied that he wished Olórin to go as the third messenger to Middle-earth (and it is remarked that 'Olórin was a lover of the Eldar that remained,' apparently to explain Manwë's choice). But Olórin replied that he was too weak for such a task, and that he feared Sauron.Then Manwë said that that was all the more reason why he should go […]"

 

"[…] The meaning of these relations between Istari and Valar is clearly, in light of the brief narrative just cited, that each Istar was chosen by each  Vala for his innate characteristics -- perhaps even that they were members of the 'people' of that Vala, in the same sense as is said of Sauron in  the Valaquenta (The Silmarillion) that in the beginning he was of the Maiar of Aulë, and he remained might in the lore of that people.'"

 



 

All of the above suggests to me that as a result of his ancient roots and connection with one of the Valar, Gandalf might have some insights into possible/likely futures. His limited ability to foretell future events also would have been a combination of intuition and deduction derived over a millennia of observing mortal/Elvish behaviour in Middle Earth (though as indicated in the second last spoiler, as an Istar, he had to "learn much anew by slow experience"). Aside from that, Gandalf does seem to believe in Fate (the inevitable outcome of the music of the Valar that created the world in the Silmarillion?) or discrete divine intervention leading things in a certain direction, though that fate can be altered through the (unanticipated) actions of mortals and immortals alike ('for even the very wise cannot see all ends').  

 

All this of course being a long-winded answer that essentially supports what Estel Edain and Gandalf DK have already suggested in prior posts…  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

As I waited for the Gandalf debate late replies, which I judge have now had the ttime to come, I would like to ask some other questions.

I was just reading the Apendices A- About the Dwarves and I always wonder about a couple of things:

1. Will the Dwarves go extinct in Middle-Earth in the Fourth Age?

2. Is there more writing about Gimli setting sail to the Undying Lands then that last note?

3. What was Dol Goldur before Sauron took refuge there?

4. What... Okay let's stick with the Dwarves-theme, how much did Moria occupy/take in area of the Misty Mountains?

5. Are there any tales about how Dwarves get children? ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

On Giants, they were a nature creature in tolkiens world.  the stone giants throw stones back and forth in the hobbit and many think that other giants tolkien mentioned where actually ents, or even huorns.  

“Bilbo… saw that across the valley the stone-giants were out, and where hurling rocks at one another for a game, and catching them, and tossing them down into the darkness where they smashed among the trees far below, or splintered into little bits with a bang…they could hear the giants guffawing and shouting all over the mountainside.”

As much as I love Peter Jackson, I gotta say he didn't understand the background behind tolkien's works as we see often happens.  But the designers for LOTR LCG saga expansion OHaUH hit the nail on the head.  it was a cool idea to but the stone giants in even though it isn't quite thematic for them to be enemies.  And I love the encounter card "guffawing giants" SO thematic.  Just got to love the "over misty mountains grim" quest.  The more I read tolkien the more I realize how incredible he was and what an incredible job the lotr lcg designers did transforming his masterpieces into an amazing game!  

Ok enough about giants!

gandalfDK: your qs!

1)The Dwarves [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_(Middle-earth)] of Durin's Folk [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durin%27s_Folk] prospered in Erebor [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erebor], and there are indications Gimli [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimli_(Middle-earth)] led a group of dwarves to Aglarond [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helm%27s_Deep#Aglarond].

Mining expeditions were sent to Khazad-dûm [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khazad-d%C3%BBm] where mithril [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mithril] was again mined, used to restore the gates of Minas Tirith [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minas_Tirith], but Khazad-dûm was not immediately recolonized. There are, however, indications that a Durin the Last [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durin] later did rebuild this Dwarven Kingdom, returning Durin's Folk to their ancestral homes.

Apparently the Dwarven race began to dwindle by the end of the Fourth Age, for their women made up less than a third of their population. Often, the women would not desire to marry, or want a husband that they couldn't have. Similarly, many Dwarven men were too engrossed in their crafts and did not have the time to take a wife and have children. Their ultimate fate is unclear. 



2) don't think so.  We don't even know whether he was excepted or not.  

3) it was originally built by Oropher, Thranduil's father.  it was called: Amon Hinc, or the barren hill.  The elves abandoned it because they would rather go northward.

4) dono 

5) dono either

gandalf says, and i believe im right in remembering, it is a 40 mile trek as the crow flies through moria...so thats is its width across the mountains... there is a detailed atlas by Fonstad which gives very indepth info on these things though unfortunatly i dont have a copy...

though i can imagine that given all the intertwining tunnels, various levels, habitable and mining areas.... it could stretch at least twice as far as that in north/south length, though im just guessing here

## 19 [TwiceBorn on November 4, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126151-tolkien-lore-q-a/?do=findComment&comment=1322099)

Richsabre is correct. I recently received a copy of the atlas, and it also says that Gandalf calculated it was at least "forty miles from the West-door to the East-gate in a direct line." The shallow valley in which the West-door was located was about three eights of a mile between the falls (Stair Falls) and the gate, and possibly two miles from end to end. The guardroom is shown to be around 3900 feet deep, and Fonstad judges that the "mines could have been as deep as 12,500 feet and still have been within the limits reached in our Primary World."  

 

The maps and text in the atlas explicitly reference various Tolkien sources. I highly recommend getting a copy of the atlas, it's a wonderful addition that enhances my reading enjoyment of all of Tolkiens's writings on Middle-Earth: http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/The_Atlas_of_Middle-earth.  [http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/The_Atlas_of_Middle-earth.%C2%A0]

 

As a point of reference, the Misty Mountains (including the Mountains of Angmar) are 702 miles in length.  

 

GandalfDK, I also find this compilation to be a handy reference work (though not necessarily 100% complete/correct, but close) if you're looking for quick answers on some subjects without flipping through your various Tolkien primary sources: http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1120372.The_Complete_Tolkien_Companion.  [http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1120372.The_Complete_Tolkien_Companion.%C2%A0]

Great topic idea, Rich! I love Tolkien's lore.

 

Can I point out that orcs descending from corrupted elves is an idea Tolkien eventually scrapped? He never quite seemed to settle on the origins of orcs, but decided they were their own race and reproduced as other mortal races did, and that they were not of elvish origin. 

 

I've been thinking about the lineage of the Noldor in the Third Age. Does anyone know whether Elrond could've claimed the title of High King of the Noldor after the fall of Gil-Galad? I'm just rereading the FotR and trying to get through the Council of Elrond, where Boromir (?) says something like the power of the lord of Imladris lies not in arms but in wise counsel. He obviously does not savour battle, but he seems to have been Gil-Galad's second-in-command in The Last Alliance. Maybe he didn't want to become king, but could he have made a case for himself if he wanted to unite the elves of Middle-Earth under one banner?

That's not exactly true, orcs were indeed some of the (first-born) Quendi captured by Morgoth and through torture, slavery and corruption were turned into orcs by Morgoths foul arts. He created the orcs in envy and mockery of the Elves.

I do not think Elrond had ever a desire to become High King. Elrond rather would have liked a counsil of the different Elves. But as a matter of fact, Elrond was the High King. There were not that many elves left to rule west of the Misty Mountains, other then already under his command, were there?

In early (and maybe even some printed) chronicles, yes, but Tolkien revisited these passages because he found a problem: he eventually settled on the fact that no one apart from Eru is capable of creating life, and Morgoth's ability to "corrupt" orcs means he can create a new race. And he wasn't supposed to be able to create life. This was a problem. Tolkien was also concerned with orcs' longevity - if they were indeed descended from elves, they'd probably be immortal and he didn't want that. This is muddled, but he seems eventually to have settled on the orcs not being related to elves - he just doesn't give an alternative explanation.

@RichSabre

I always thought of the Giants as a more primal or beast like species that fall in with all the various animals in middle earth. They may not necessarily have a fëa (soul) or at least not one that goes anywhere and simply dies with their hröa. Therefore they aren't all that important in the grand scheme of things and are just another creature, albiet a very humanoid one and probably one far cleverer than simple animals and most probably with sentience of some sort. Perhaps they are some sort of original experiment or project by Eru before he created his children, maybe he was just experimenting with appearance, size and nature and made the Giants but without fëa. He may have then left them in this primal state and decided that elves and men should be far smaller in stature but of a similar form. As far as Sauron using them perhaps they were too high in the mountains and too volatile for it to be worthwhile. I'm sure he could have brought them under his control if he tried hard enough/used enough forces to do so but the Giants may have taken out many orcs in the process so it might have just not been worth it especially when he already had armored Olog-Hai. Just my two cents :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

As far as the origin of the Orcs I'm not sure why their longevity was one of Tolkiens main concerns if they were indeed created from Tortured/Corrupted Elves as the loss of immortality could easily be explained as a side effect of being so cruelly and fully misshapen and tortured. Morgoth was able to infuse middle earth ITSELF and its various elements (gold, silver, water etc etc etc) with his own essence meaning that every being and place had the potential for corruption or greed. He is almost like corruption incarnate really so I can see him infusing the tortured and twisted elves with parts of his own being and essence which would surely effect and remove their gift of immortality and seems to have also been so full on that they were considered from that point on a different species. 

Merely disfiguring and torturing the elves into looking like the orcs do and breaking them mentally would not result in their offspring being the same either so obviously Morgoths essense or will being infused into them must have been what twisted them into a new race. So he hasn't created life but has rather corrupted an existing group of beings into a new type of being.

Holy cuss, I had a long and brilliant response typed up when a link got accidentally clicked. 

 

In short: could Giants have been ('internally', that is in the context of the story within the fictional narrative) an invention of Bilbo wanting to spice up his memoirs?

 

And, Elrond could easily have claimed kingship over the remaining High Elves had he wanted to, even if his heritage was not as closely linked to the original Nolodorin lords of the First Age, simply because (1) he was so wise and revered and (2) his father was Eärendil.

This is my own headcanon as to why The Hobbit is written so differently from The Lord of the Rings and for some of the discrepancies (why the Elves act so differently, the appearance of giants, etc.), all these differences reflect Bilbo's style as a storyteller and some of his poetic license.

## 29 [PsychoRocka on November 5, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126151-tolkien-lore-q-a/?do=findComment&comment=1323033)

That's a pretty cool way of looking at it and interesting theory. I'm sure he definitely would have added small bits and pieces to his story to make it sound grander!

I thought this was exactly why Tolkien wrote orcs as having been corrupted elves in the first place -- certainly Morgoth could not create life, so he took existing life and corrupted it instead.

The Vala, Aulë is attributed for creating the dwarves out of "impatience" to wait for the elves to awaken.

Eru eventually allowed them to be part of the world but because of the manner of their creation their animosity with the elves is an integral part of their being.

I know it's in the Silmarillion, but the Silmarillion is outdated.

 

Tolkien's own words in Text VIII of Myths Transformed in History of Middle-Earth volume X: Morgoth's Ring:

 

Orcs

 

Their nature and origin require more thought. They are not easy to work into the theory and system.

 

(1) As the case of Aule and the Dwarves shows, only Eru could make creatures with independent wills, and with reasoning powers. But Orcs seem to have both: they can try to cheat Morgoth/Sauron, rebel against him, or criticize him.

 

(2) ? Therefore they must be corruptions of something pre-existing.

 

(3) But Men had not yet appeared, when the Orcs had already existed. Aule constructed the Dwarves out of his memory of the Music; but Eru would not sanction the work of Melkor so as to allow the independence of the Orcs. (Not unless Orcs were ultimately remediable, or could be amended and 'saved'?)

 

It also seems clear (see 'Finrod and Andreth') that though Melkor could utterly corrupt and ruin individuals, it is not possible to comtemplate his absolute perversion of a whole people, or group of peoples, and his making that state heritable.

 

In that case Elves, as a source, are very unlikely. And are Orcs 'immortal', in the Elvish sense? Or trolls? It seems clearly implied in The Lord of the Rings that trolls existed in their own right, but were 'tinkered' with by Melkor.

 

Emphasis mine. 

 

This is a question of what you consider canon and not. Surely the Silmarillion should be considered canon, but so should the History of Middle-Earth, and that was published much later and had new ideas that Tolkien had not fully worked out when he wrote the early legends. When these two contradict each other, what are we to believe? I guess we could each decide for ourselves. It seems that Tolkien eventually did not intend for orcs to be related to elves, but died before he could make a final ruling on it.

And thus we have the earliest known "retcon."  Well, those writings are very theoretical, so as you say it is a question or what you consider canon.  The passage you cite is hardly "history," but rather a "notes scrawled in the margin" type of finding, in the process of arriving at a place that Tolkien unfortunately never arrived.

 

I would say it's too bold to say that Tolkien "scrapped" that idea of Orcs being bred from Elves.  He was clearly not satisfied with that, but in the end left us with only one account of their origin in prose that was intended for other people's eyes.

Agreed. Given what text we have between our hands - this is the only logical conclusion. Perhaps if Tolkien had lived longer and had more time to work on this we would have seen something different. Sadly it was not so, yet we have the Silmarillion in the state that Tolkien himself left behind and i can't think of a better/more trusted resource for the history of the old world of Tolkiens mythos.

## 36 [Olorin93 on November 5, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126151-tolkien-lore-q-a/?do=findComment&comment=1323639)

The quote you provide from the Silmarillion doesn't actually say "this is what happened", just what the Elves assumed. It seems also to be what Tolkien believed at the time. The reason the Silmarillion exists is that Christopher Tolkien wanted to try and make his father's notes into a coherent whole, which it never was. Few drafts were what could be viewed as complete. The History of Middle-Earth has other drafts and ideas, which I consider just as canon (and, if they are newer, perhaps even more).

## 37 [GrandSpleen on November 5, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126151-tolkien-lore-q-a/?do=findComment&comment=1323876)

Since Tolkien viewed the whole enterprise as himself "discovering" Middle-earth and not creating it, perhaps it is best if we take the same view and lay aside the notion that "canon" and "truth" are synonyms.  Nobody knows where orcs come from.  The elves believe the orcs are descended from corrupted elves.  Beyond that, all we can do is speculate.

I certainly don't hope that's true. (not that there is a truth) For I am an ornithologist and very interested in ME animals & plants (fauna and flora), so the more creatures the marrier. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] And if it were his memoirs, why would he tell about the Ring then? I don't quite remember it anymore, but did Gandalf force him to put it in or did he so himself? Because if I am correct Frodo and Gandalf talked about this subject in the Lord. Bilbo didn't want to tell the rest about the Ring, but Gandalf suspected. Afterwards Bilbo told the truth, but was still ashamed for not telling back then. Now my memories fail and did Bilbo put it in his memoirs because of that or not?

Also my new question: Are the Silvan Elves or rather Thranduil and the Mirkwood Elves setting sail for the other side too or do they remain? For Thranduil had not a Ring of Pwe so his realm did not fall/fail and could grow now Sauron and his evil was removed. Dol Goldir could have been cleansed and rebuild, the Old Forest Road reused. Yet I did not read anything about either their passing or staying. But there are some lines that suggest all Elves left, including Thran and co. Especially the part of Arwen going to Lorien after Aragorn's passing seems to suggest such, but only for Galadriel and Celeborn.''Galadriel had past away and also Celeborn was gone, the land was empty.' I always find it a great pity that the Elves left and everything they built to perish into decay and abandonisation.

The in-universe explanation for the difference in the stories is that Bilbo told the fake story in his memoirs. In fact, he never changed the story himself, but it was said that either Frodo or Sam changed this to reflect the true story later on.

I'm not sure I'm clear on the question. Are you asking if Thranduil sailed West? That remains unclear. The Call, if you will, remained/remains open to all of the Eldar for as long as the world lasts. Some (mostly those dark elves that did not heed the original call of the Valar, but also some Silvan/Noldor) refused the call even through physical death.

 

This whole issue came up with the heated Shadow of Mordor discussions and I was directed to a passage in the Histories in which Tolkien describes the Elves in spirit form and how they could resist the Call of Mandos, lusting to remain in Middle-earth. These often fell under the 'counter-summons' of Morgoth and later Sauron and their spirits were used for evil. 

 

All that's to say that, even though the Elves were bound to Middle-earth, each could make a choice to return to the Blessed Realm. I have no idea if Thranduil did or not, but any Elves that remained 'devolved' into the faerie spirits that became the subject of much of our own folklore ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

 

And, yes, it is very sad when the Elves go.

...Rhun....

 

yes, that is all ..

 

no, i mean, what was there? who lived there? who controlled there? what do we know of it? and why did aragorn visit there but gandalf never did?

## 46 [gandalfDK on November 6, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126151-tolkien-lore-q-a/?do=findComment&comment=1324988)

Yes, shipwreck, I was indeed asking if Thranduil sailed to the West. I was wondering, because after the Hobbit, he doesn't really get any attention. (It may be in the UT, but I have yet to read that (very quickly!)) Also I was wondering because I hoped he didn't so that there would be some Elves left in ME and his kingdom wouldn't be left to rot in Angband too, because Thranduil did not posses a Ring of Power, which would mean his realm wasn't dependend on its powe, so therefore non in it would then suddenly 'fall'.

 

As for Elrond becoming High King, I don't think he would have wanted such a title for himself. I see Elrond more in the way of a  puppiteer (hope it is translated well), the one in the back pulling some ropes. Ropes in the form of guided advice. And what I meant with my earlier post, the High King of the Noldor wouldn't rule over Lorien or Mirkwood, so why should he even take such a title? All other Elves west of the Misty Mountains are already under his control.

 

Rich, I was about to post a similair question. 

 

But I know some things about Rhûn. It has never been visited by Gandalf indeed and Aragorn once, but also Saruman and the two Blue Wizards travelled there. As we know, the Blue Wizards (Alatar and Pallando) stayed. My guess is that Gandalf just didn't have any business there and rather trusted Alatar and Pallando to solve matters there. Aragorn has probably travelled there to learn his 'enemy'. What are their principals and manners of living? He had to become a wise ruler and strength in war is found in knowing your enemy (scrying ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]), and also learning to respect other people for the choices they (have to/forced to) make. 

 

Rhûn is supposedly somewhat like Mongolia, but we actually don't know. There is a Sea in the middle of Rhûn, the Sea of Rhûn, so probably the climate around that area wasn't so bad. They have fought against Gondor mostly on horses (Wainraider) what also shows a connection to Atilla the Hun from Mongolia and rather not as the film depictes as mostly spearman. 

 

Rhûn is inhabitated by Dwarfs, Men and Elves. All live originates from Rhûn; In the far east of Rhûn is where the first Elves and Men woke up. Two groups of 'lost' Elves remained there, the ones we call Dark Elves and they resisted or rather ignored the Call (see above in other post for explanation). Also in the mountains that lie in the far east, 4 of the 7 Dwarf clans live there. That almost everything we know about those Dwarves. But the main group of inhabitants are Men, also know as Easterlings.  

 

It is suggested to be ruled by several kings, who were head of a tribe, so no unification, only if one king could rise up and claim command. Somewhat like in old Mongolia. The Easterlings have fought many wars with the West, under the service of Sauron and under themselfs. During the Wainraider invasion, they were united under 1 banner by a strong leader and so could assemble a force to almost conquer Gondor. (Eorl saved them luckily) In the Thirth Age, many of the several tribeleaders swore oaths to Sauron and their main army attacked Erebor and Dale In the Fourth Age Aragorn and his son subdued them in their wars against them, and probably made peace after several victories, when they had shown the new strenght of Gondor and Rohan.

 

We know not much about them. Not even what language they spoke..

"Rhun is somewhat like Mongolia" Hmmm, dodgy assumption right there... Tolkien did base the ORCS on the "less liked Mongolian types" to go against the European westerners. We do know that in Rhun there lived Southrons or Easterlings (don't remember) and certainly different media and games (especially MERP and MECCG) depicted these peoples as slightly west Asians and Arabic.

## 49 [gandalfDK on November 7, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126151-tolkien-lore-q-a/?do=findComment&comment=1325483)

Rhûn was mostly inhabitated by Easterlings (Southrons live in Harad, Harad also meaning South) and I did not say the people looked Asain or whatever, I was referring to the livestyle in old Mongolia in the age of the Roman Empire.

If memory serves that is where the wainriders come from, so I can see the Mongolian connexion (movie name, called it). I've also heard them compared to ancient Scythians.

GandalfDK hit all the bases, and I think I like that the East is so ambiguous. Besides possibilities of culture and debates over what they looked like, it gives credence to what Sam thinks in Two Towers (bequeathed to Faramir in the movies) -- was the Southron really evil at heart? We don't know how bad it was over there and why the evil men did what they did.

Also, I'm going to go ahead and disagree with you here. In a way, I'm glad Tolkien left unfinished. He passed before he could suck. Think about how many artists, musicians, writers, film-makers, etc, who just drag things on for way too long. I don't know that Tolkien would have inevitably fallen into that trap, had he published younger or lived longer, because he was so self-critical and meticulous. Even so, I appreciate that there are so many gaps and unexplained legends.

I will answer with a quote: 'People have to live with one great injustice all the time: the definite end of things.'

-The Dalai Lama

I cannot but elaborate a bit on this. With Tolkien dead, there never will be any more stories from him about ME whatsoever. That is really sad. Of course I actually don't wanr answers to all my questions, but even.for the posibility to a new tale or anything is kinda sad. That may even be one of the biggest reasons why I play LotR LCG, just fooling the mind 'yeah it's a new story!', works really well. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

next question

The dragons were a creation of Morgoth, but after Morgoth, were they all destroyed like the Balrogs (except a few like Smaug and Durins Bane)? And were did they live the most? What do we know about them? I read somewhere somthing about a colddrake, so I assume there are different species? Do.dlthey live in the lands above Gundabad and Angmar?

## 54 [GrandSpleen on November 8, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126151-tolkien-lore-q-a/?do=findComment&comment=1326460)

Yes, I've been wondering this myself, about dragons.  Should we expect to see one in The Lost Realm expansion?

## 55 [PsychoRocka on November 8, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126151-tolkien-lore-q-a/?do=findComment&comment=1326472)

After Morgoth I believe that Dragons lived and bred in a place called the Withered Heath which was North of Erebor on the Eastern most part of the Grey Mountains. The Dwarves once had a large colony in the Grey Mountains (Durin's Folk, I think in the Second age? perhaps the First age as well?) but due to constant attack from dragons in general they migrated to (if I can remember correctly) The Iron Hills and Erebor and abandoned all their mines and strongholds etc. Then Smaug (who I'm pretty sure is from the Withered Heath and only a few thousand years old and not at all created by Morgoth) came down to Erebor and took it for himself.

 

So there are almost definitely still some dragons left as the Grey Mountains were utterly abandoned by the third age by the Dwarves and I doubt anyone ventured up there specifically to slay dragons. They are probably only Colddrakes which are much smaller than Firedrakes (Smaug is one of these).

Considering that The Lost Realm and Angmar Awakened are taking place in the area that was once Arnor and Angmar (which is at the Western most point of the Grey Mountains and very far from the Withered Heath) I doubt there will be any dragons or drakes in that cycle. I guess that there could be some in Western parts of the Grey Mountains though... especially in the third age where there are no dwarves left to eat on the Eastern end!

Psycho hit most of what we know about the big lizards. My personal thought is that they diminished in power after Morgoth was defeated, and/or the most powerful ones were destroyed in the War of Wrath. The word 'worm' is used in later ages (as in Scatha the Worm) so I expect those dragons were more like Glaurung in that they could not fly, and so were somewhat more manageable. I also believe that's why Smaug was such a big deal: the last of the great winged dragons.

Sadly I have no real idea about Utumno..

 

I have some new questions! Creature Feature

 

Do we really now if there are different kinds of Wargs? Like Gundabad Wargs or Isengard Wargs? No right?

I think it is an adaption of PJ. But on the other hand, I don't see why it is not possible. Species living in different locations can show genetic differences, but then would Wargs be something to be seen as a name for a group of species like 'wolves' or 'doglike mammals' or more as 'Eurasian Wolf' or 'Eurasian Fox'? 

 

What are Fell Beasts? (if they even really carry that name?) 

 

What creatures towed Grond to the gates of Minas Tirith?

How many different kind of Olog-Hai are there?
 

What happened to all the creatures commanded by Sauron after his defeat?

Especially to the werewolves, as Gandalf suggested (somewhere?) they survived into the Third Age.

Getting into this 'creature' stuff, I've not thought at length about it but I believe, as you say, that a lot of primary world zoology can be applied. So, as you say, I don't see why there would not be different strands of wargs. One of the distinctions between wargs and plain old wolves is that wargs are more intelligent and able to speak their own language. With that in mind, I don't see why there wouldn't be different 'cultures' almost, in the same way that we see distinctions between the orcs of, say, Mordor and the orcs of Mountains -- both in appearance and ways.

I've always taken the Fell Beasts to be Sauron's lesser version of the dragons. If the dragons were bred by Morgoth, surely Sauron would want to mimic his master. So he tried to make winged creatures of terror but fell short of the mark, being a lesser person than the real Enemy.

 

I think the same applies to the rest of Sauron's servants. They are evil creatures, probably mutilated and reformed by Sauron from wild animals of distant lands that we don't see in the texts. Maybe oliphaunts? As such they were all, either in spirit or by fear, bound to Sauron. When the Ring is destroyed the orcs and trolls and the rest all flee in terror; we can assume any other critters did the same. I would expect that most found some quiet corner of Mordor or elsewhere to hide and brood in much the same way that the Balrogs (and, I suppose, the werewolves) did after the War of Wrath, there to lie in wait for adventurers of later tabletop games to engage.

 

The Orcs and Trolls are slightly different in that they seem to have their own ways when they are not under the direct subjugation of the Shadow. So, like the bits we get from three trolls of The Hobbit and the Grishnak in Rings, I think the orcs and trolls 'setup shop' on their own terms. Robbing, killing, and so on, to their own liking and independently.

 

As far the types of trolls, I have no idea. The One Ring RPG has a few different classifications like Stone-trolls, Hill-trolls, Cave-trolls, Bog-trolls, and so on. I would refer back to we said about the orcs and wargs -- the differences are largely in appearance with mild variances in their ways. They are still the same 'people'.

 

So there's a wide shot, but hopefully it's helpful :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Thanks shipwreck!

I was hoping you would answer my Sindarin question!

 

Hmm, thank you for your answer on the Wargs. I find them the most awesome creatures of ME. They are so fascinating!

 

For Trolls, we do know that there are different kinds of Trolls right? At least I thought there was some mentioning of Hill-Trolls and Cave-Trolls, but I may be wrong.

 

Yes, IMO PJ depicted Fell Beasts rightly in most ways. 

PJ also depicted some sort of rhinos in front of Grond, but anything could be. Even Oliphaunts, although I think that less likely, because otherwise I think the response of the Gondorian soldiers would have been different on the arrival of the Haradrim.

Question: what do we know about the Woodmen? Are they descending from the Nortmen like the Rohirrim?

## 64 [John Constantine on August 9, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126151-tolkien-lore-q-a/?do=findComment&comment=1727671)

Woodmen were a race of Men distantly related to the Edain who, by the Third Age, inhabited the western portion of Mirkwood forest.

 

During the early and mid parts of the First Age when men began spreading throughout Middle-earth, these people dwelled in the vast forested places in Middle-earth- particularly in Brethil. Surviving the tumults and wars over the ages, the descendants of these men came to live in Mirkwood along with a mysterious race of men called the Beornings.
The Woodmen and the Beornings probably had close ties since they lived near to each other braving the many dangers of the forest.
 
After the War of the Ring and the cleansing of Mirkwood, the Woodmen and the Beornings were given a large portion of the forest between Thranduil's kingdom, Lorien, and East Lórien to dwell in.

Ok, lets break this down.

 

I visited this thread for the first time. Saw a question, googled it and copypasted the answer here. 

 

Then I saw him dubbing my post with the link to the lotr wiki, and I was curious if posting existing material here is forbidden or something (I didn't initially assumed he was considering me as an "imposter"). So I apologized and asked. And was answered with a personal attack instead of a simple answer.

When I clarified that it was simply a question - I was met with a sarcasm and total distrust. 

 

Yeah, when some random person treats you like that for no reason - I see no good reason to treat that person in any other way.

Well...you always have strong opinions on the various discussions at hand (nothing wrong with that), but it often seem like you forget that everyone else are entitled to their own opinions as well. And you always need to have the last say regarding everything. It's not a coincidence that people are beginning to react to this behavior.

The Woodman and Beornings are much alike.

Much about this topic can be read in UT, especially in the chapters about Eorl and Cieion and also about the Woses. There are some mentions about the Woodmen there. Woodmen are, if I remember correct, actually a remnant of the nowadays called Rohirrim, who also came out of that corner. When the Wainraiders came and the Plague all folk there diminished and some fled into different lands. Those that fled to Mirkwood became the Woodmen and others that stayed, but later were given Rohan are the Rohirrim. (at least, it's something along those lines.)

Same. I've never known him outside these forums so I haven't the foggiest. I seem to remember he made a post or two late last year, but not sure if he expressed an interest in the game or returning to the website. Great guy.

Well, beyond what has already been said, we do know that the Wargs and Orcs of the MIsty Mountains were preparing to launch a devastating raid on the Woodmen when they came upon Bilbo and the Dwarves in their meeting place. This chance meeting changed the course of the Woodmen's history, as it distracted the Wargs/Orcs from their purpose and brought down the wrath of the Eagles upon them as well. Because of this event, the Woodmen survived to forge a broader alliance with the Beornings, securing that portion of the North, just as Thranduil's Elves, the Dwarves of Erebor, and the Men of Lake-town eventually served as a bulwark for their portion of the North. The really fascinating subtext of The Hobbit is the way in which Bilbo's adventure helped to create a fairly unified North that could stand against Sauron when the time came.

That's really cool. I think the designers have enough material to make a northern Rhovanion cycle, and they could even make a Woodmen and Beorning subtheme for the player cards. Imagine a quest about defending a woodmen village from orcs or drakes or something like that. It'd be amazing.

I second that. And I honestly can't see any reason not to go there next cycle. There's no way we're going to Rhun or Harad -- for which the lore is scarce and even if that'd be amazing -- before we go into Rhovanion again (we visited some of those places during The Hobbit saga expansion true, but that would not be the first overlap between Sagas and regular cycles).

Also this is a great opportunity to get real faction out of Dale, Beorning and Woodmen. I'd be very curious to see how Matt and Caleb expand on the very rare lore we have about them to create interesting traits synergy and flavor. They honestly did a nice job withthe Dunlendings.

That was what Gandalf intended when he "set up" the Quest for Erebor, either by removing an unpredictable enemy (Smaug) and create a few strongholds to defend the High Pass

Indeed. But Gandalf's intentions are one thing and the destiny of ending up just in that spot on just that night, to take the Warg glade/Woodmen example, are another. If it was just a matter of Gandalf setting everything up like a master manipulator or puppet-master, that wouldn't be nearly as interesting to me (and wouldn't carry the same message) as Gandalf setting things in motion and destiny taking care of the rest.

Yes, I like to think of it that way as well. A bit of both actually. Gandalf's setting his plan in motion, but with chance and luck also playing a big part.

He did leave the company on several occasions and they were not prepaired for it. Doesn't sound like a master plan to me.

Also, the growing skill, and the choices our most famous burglar made through the course of his journey had a massive impact on the course of history.

Since someone mentioned this thread recently, I thought I'd revive, as I miss lore discussions. 

 

So here's the question...how much do you think the Valar intervened in events of the Third Age, specifically around the time of the War of the Ring. Did they just send the Istari and that was enough? Or can you find other evidence of their helping the Free Peoples? Is the favor of the valar actually a thing in lore terms?

I personally don't know if the Valar per se helped during the Free People's march to the Black Gate (that's what the card is depicting I believe) but if I'm not mistaken, Tolkien said somewhere that the last act of intervention the Valar made was returning Gandalf to life.

Nice move,Raven1015! 

This is a very though question, seen the few things that speak of this. I would tend to think of the Istari as one of few, if not the only physical act of 'intervening'.
Of course, there is also Gandalf the Grey turning White. Glorfindel is there to end the Witch-King's rule up in Angmar and saved Frodo and Eagles. Also, the visions of Faramir and Boromir might be from the Valar.
Another remarkable thing is from the Unfinished Tales, I think, the rejection of Saruman his spirit.

But to explain their limited interventions in the Third Age, I have found this.

It is stated that the power of Manwë and the other Valar was also lessening. They were instructed to prepare Arda for the arrival of the Children and as time progressed, things became more and more 'things', they were 'weakened.'
I do not believe they did nothing, but they surely didn't sent out Örome to hunt Orcs.


A note in the Myths Transformed essays in History of Middle-earth 10:

Another note from the same essay.

> Nonetheless the breaking of Thangorodrim and the extrusion of Melkor was the end of 'Morgoth' as such, and for that age (and many ages after). It was thus, also, in a sense the end of Manwë's prime function and task as Elder King, until the End. He had been the Adversary of the Enemy.

I think it was Illuvatar himself who brought Gandalf back (see here http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Eru_Il%C3%BAvatar#Interventions). [http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Eru_Il%C3%BAvatar#Interventions).]

Not by the 'gods' whose business is only with this embodied world and its time; for he passed 'out of thought and time'.

 

Then Illuvatar intervened again at Mount Doom, causing Gollum to trip.

Huh. But at that point couldn't just about anything that happens that is attributable to "fate" also be attributable to Illuvatar? I mean, we know that Eru Illuvatar is a different entity to the Valar and pretty much the elven word for "God", the supreme being, etc. If we consider, as the Silmarillion states, that all that happens in it, including the LOTR trilogy, is just the mythology/cosmology of the elves and that Middle Earth is in fact our world but in a different onthological state, then Illuvatar is basically the same being as the christian God. So then we could make the conclusion that, if only Eru was responsible for bringing Gandalf back, then the Valar had no part in it.

## 109 [Seastan on December 7, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126151-tolkien-lore-q-a/?do=findComment&comment=1922001)

When he says 'gods' he definitely means Valar. When he says 'Authority' he refers to Eru Illuvatar, No need to dig any deeper than that. The Valar didn't have the power to bring Gandalf back.

Still, that doesn't make it a less interesting point.

On the letters, I would like to share the Tolkien Professors standpoint.

He says that once a book is written and published it is in the 'commonwealth'. He means by this that (the case was Tolkien) once his books were published, it's done. Tolkien does not have a 'higher' opinion then anyone else. His letters are his interpretation of the written story, so they are not some sort of appendix. You have to work with the story as is published, nothing more and nothing less.

That makes an interpretation the Tolkien Professor would come up with, on the same level as a letter or something Master of Lore might come up with.

I find this an interesting point and agree with him on most account.

## 111 [Estel Edain on December 7, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126151-tolkien-lore-q-a/?do=findComment&comment=1922383)

Luck, fate or providence is a significant theme of Tolkien's, and the Valar's participation in the Music of the Ainur suggests that they are in some sense involved as the story unfolds.

 

As Gandalf tells Frodo, the Ring

> "abandoned Gollum. Only to be picked up by the most unlikely person imaginable: Bilbo from the Shire! Behind that there was something else at work, beyond any design of the Ring-maker. I can put it no plainer than by saying that Bilbo was meant to find the Ring, and not by its maker. In which case you also were meant to have it. And that may be an encouraging thought."

 

The vision that Faramir and Boromir received is a bit like the old Laketown song foretelling the return of the King under the Mountain, with rivers running golden. At the end of The Hobbit, Bilbo hears about Laketown's new prosperity:

> "Then the prophecies of the old songs have turned out to be true, after a fashion!" said Bilbo.
> 
>  
> 
> "Of course!" said Gandalf. "And why should not they prove true? Surely you don't disbelieve the prophecies, because you had a hand in bringing them about yourself? You don't really suppose, do you, that all your adventures and escapes were managed by mere luck, just for your sole benefit? You are a very fine person, Mr. Baggins, and I am very fond of you; but you are only quite a little fellow in a wide world after all!"

 
If the vision of Faramir and Boromir is from the Valar, perhaps they also inspired that song.
 
The Eagles are associated with Manwe, and are a key part of the eucatastrophic moments so important to Tolkien. For more on this, look at Master of Lore's great article: https://masteroflore.wordpress.com/2013/03/18/the-eagles-are-coming/ [https://masteroflore.wordpress.com/2013/03/18/the-eagles-are-coming/]
 
At several key moments in the Lord of the Rings, Varda or Elbereth's name is invoked, and it clearly has power. At Weathertop, the Witch-king gives a shrill cry after Frodo calls out "O Elbereth! Gilthoniel!" The Witch-king magically silences Frodo when he invokes her name at the Ford of Bruinen. Legolas invokes Elbereth before his mighty shot that kills the Nazgûl's fell beast while travelling down the Anduin. Sam and Frodo use her name and the Phial of Galadriel to get past the Watchers and escape Cirith Ungol. Most significantly, when Shelob is about to kill Sam,

> a thought came to him, as if some remote voice had spoken, and he fumbled in his breast with his left hand, and found...the Phial of Galadriel.
> 
> ...
> 
> And then his tongue was loosed and his voice cried in a language which he did not know:
> A Elbereth Gilthoniel
> o menel palan-diriel,
> le nallon sí di'nguruthos!
> A tiro nin, Fanuilos!

 

Notice the passive voice, which leaves the source ambiguous: "a thought came" and "his tongue was loosed." In letter 278, Tolkien translated Sam's invocation as:

>  O Elbereth Starkindler from heaven gazing-afar, to thee I cry now in the shadow of (the fear of) death. O look towards me, Everwhite.

 

Sam then confronted Shelob with the Phial, which burns her deeply and drives her away (earlier, the Phial had only temporarily rebuffed her):

>  It flamed like a star that leaping from the firmament sears the dark air with intolerable light.

 

That definitely seems like an intervention by Varda Starkindler. It's similar to Sam asking Galadriel for rope after climbing down a cliff in Emyn Muil (and the knot comes undone), and for light and water in Mordor (which they get).

 

The Valar's interventions in the Third Age are generally indirect, as Arda becomes less explicitly magical, but they fit into the broader picture of "luck" helping those who persevere in virtue.
