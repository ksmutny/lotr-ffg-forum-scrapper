I just got my hands on this game and I am loving it.  Was able to successfully play through Passage Through Mirkwood using the starter decks in the core set.  Since I got this collection on ebay, it also includes the 6 Shadows of Mirkwood adventure packs and the Khazad Dum box.  Do I need to buy the other adventure packs and deluxe expansions to get the cards there to make successful decks or is it better to work through one cycle at a time?  What is the recommended order for buying the other adventure packs/deluxe expansion/saga expansions?  And I'm guessing the nightmare decks are something I should probably steer clear of for a while.

 

Thanks.

I think we need a megathread for stuff like this.

Hey, welcome to the game! Hope you enjoy it. 

 

With the core set, Mirkwood cycle packs and Khazad-Dum you should be set for a while. After that I would recommend the 6 Dwarrowdelf cycle packs (connected to Khazad-Dum) or the Black Riders saga expansion which has some great player cards. But really, I'd take it slow and figure out if you like the game in the long run before you start spending.

 

And someone always makes sure to link Beorn's Path [https://hallofbeorn.wordpress.com/beorns-path/] to new players. Check it out!

This game is **** awesome welcome to it!!!

As a newbiew myself i would say:

1: play packs/expansions one at a time in order of release.

2: the core scenarios are great, but while mirkwood is fun, anduin takes some luck/strategy to beat with only core cards and dol-guldur is ridiculously hard. But all are fun.

3: game opens up more as you get slowly used to new cards.

4: how many diffetent scenarios are available to buy???? Isnt that awesome!!! You dont get that with a 1vs1 card game.

5: did i mention the game is awesome.

6: so many variations, change the scenario and need to change the deck. So varied.

7: welcome again :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
