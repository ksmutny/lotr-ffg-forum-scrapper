The Old Hatreds and Wild Men of Dunland treachery cards from the Voice of Isengard say "Attach to the current quest." Do these stay in play for that entire quest you are playing or are they discarded after you progress to a new quest card (from 2b to 3a)?

Under the Attachment Cards in the rules it says "If the card to which an attachment is attached leaves play, the attachment card is discarded."  So are these cards attached to a quest card, say 2b and are then discarded when you progress to 3a or are they arbitrarily attached to the quest and will trigger their effects for the rest of whatever quest you are playing??

 

I would assume they attach to a specific quest card and when you progress to the next quest card are discarded.. what do you think?

Your assumption is correct. This question was asked and an official answer received: see this thread [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/100323-voi-att]
