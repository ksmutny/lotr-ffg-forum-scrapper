Man, for all you "theme" solo players out there, get ready for a brutal quest -- the threat gain is just unreal. The trolls are nasty. The "sack" deck is worse. I've tried this quest a few times with no success. So much damage, so much threat gain. I'm not ready to declare it unplayable solo, but it definitely requires a well-tailored deck.

And forget only having characters that were alive at the time of The Hobbit. haha.

they didn't give difficulty ratings, and i like to play in order, but i hear the 3rd is rough, as well. so, i can't say, as I've only tried the first.

it's nothing like the previous quests, IMO. previously, you worry about threat or damage, not both. this had both in multitude. the new gandalf is junk solo (too expensive to keep in play for most decks), particularly in this quest. putting back in the old gandalf is what allowed me to get as far as i did, but it still wasn't enough.

i don't want to spoil too much, but it's difficult without cards like Lore-agorn, Glorfindel, and other low threat type heroes.

if anything, it's like escape from gul dulgor, x4 (because instead of losing 1 hero, you can lose all 4 to sacks).

I wanted to try this quest quickly so I just used my Loragorn & the Ninja Twins deck and beat it two times out of three, but when you have Loragorn you largely don' care about threat.  (The loss was due to me getting greedy with Loragorn's ability.)  But to your point, I agree.  I am trying to build a deck that only uses Thorin & co. dwarves (or other generics, but no Gimli, Thalin, Dain) and I'm not sure how to manage the threat AND the trolls.

## 9 [Zdawg88 on August 20, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69522-1st-hobbit-quest-solo/?do=findComment&comment=677780)

 Yeah, this is the direction I'm going for this quest and haven't won yet. Themed and solo is tough. I've been running Thorin, Bifur, and Nori. Thorin is there for the resource collection, Bifur there for the Lore sphere and Dwarf Allies like the record keeper, and Nori to keep the Threat low. The first stage I've tried to stall to build my allies up plus Gandalf. Sort of like a strategy used often in conflict of the carrick. Once stage 2 comes up I try to pick off the lowest threat troll. Unfortunately without Dane the Dwarf allies like the Hammersmith and Mapmaker don't hit as hard. I'm thinking of trying to add some Tactics cards into the deck to get some combat boosting abilities into play. Having to run all spheres in solo is kind of tough so I'm not sure what I would take out. 

We'll see. I'm sure I could beat this quest, but I would like to keep the Heroes themed.

normally i don't care about theme as much, but seeing as how this is a saga expansion, and that seems to be the purpose, i wanted to give it a go.

 I'm thinking Thorin, Ori and Nori with Narvi's belt for a few Tactics cards when I need some big hits at the end.  Gotta love Nori holding up the tankard!

 Let's talk troll killing strategy.  The first troll can't be snared, and the first two can only be attacked by one character at a time.

Any good ideas?  ( A Sneak Attack Beorn wouldn't be a bad play maybe.)

When I played this the first time, someone used 2 Khazad! Khazad! with Goblin Cleaver on Gimli, who had 3 damage and a Dwarven Axe attached to one shot a troll. But I probably will never see that happen ever again.

I don't have the box yet, but I heared they give two decklists consisting of cards only from the hobbit and one core set. Can you do the quests with these (with any hope of success)? If not (and it sounds like) that would be… mockery…or at least not very nice?!

I was thinking Dain, Nori and Ori could be great - though a bit less thematic than the above, of course. I still don't have the box but I like what I am reading. Not only Shadow and Flame but also the Hobbit is going to be quite different from the previous experiences. Then we get the Lake Town and Númenor which might be very different again, hurray!

i doubt they can accomplish it solo (one has wondering took in it, for goodness sake!) but maybe paired together they can work.

I haven't tried the suggested decks - and I won't - because I don't think they're very good.  Not that I'm a great deck builder, but I don't like these at all.

My Thorin, Ori and Nori deck is 2 for 2 against the first quest.  I'm really happy with this deck, but it could be even better.*  The hard part for me isn't so much beating the trolls, it's finding the key and purse.  (I'm basically not putting them into the deck until stage 2 because the wording is so bad.)  The strategy is to slow play stage 1 while getting all my dwarven allies in play and reducing my threat via GG and Gandalf.  Then move to stage 2 and take the trolls on one by one.  By this time Erebor Battle Master will be swinging for 10 and can take a troll down in a couple of hits.*  Take out the first troll with EBM, then Forest Snare the 2nd one and then kill the third one.  The reason I snare the second one is that the third brings 2 sacks with him and I don't want to risk Ori being sacked at the wrong time.

*At first I included Khazad! and Heavy Stroke in my deck to increase EBM's hitting power, but Thorin is a sack magnet and is never around to play these for me at the critical time (with Narvi's Belt).  So I'm going to take these out and put in another Dwarven Tomb and Miner of the Iron Hills.

How does this quest compares with conflict at the carrock?

They seem so similar, as to make one of them redundant….

totally different. from my perspective, this is more like Escape from the core set, as your heroes get taken out of play and it's quite annoying (especially in solo)…and you really have to manage threat, which you don't in CaC.

## 20 [Shockeffect on August 22, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69522-1st-hobbit-quest-solo/?do=findComment&comment=679533)

I tried Richsabre's Flight from the ford deck that he has talked about, and beat it first try.  In response to the whole troll key and purse thing, what we noticed is you have to shuffle the discard pile back into the encounter deck when you start stage two.  We missed that our first few attempts. With this, its not nearly as difficult to get the objectives, and with the flight to the ford deck I was able to just quest through stage two and only engage one of the trolls, and keep it engaged with me.  It actually happened fairly easy.

In response to Koraldon, it is still pretty different, not to mention is very thematically entertaining.  Very likely, CatC was put out by ffg before they had thought of this, as it is a little redundant but Im sure almost no one minds, too cool of a quest!

They are so similar that I would hazard a guess as to say that Carrock was meant to recreate the situation in The Hobbit, but was designed BEFORE FFG got the license to do The Hobbit.

However, the trolls are different (and maybe a little worse) and the sacks and the sack mechnic are certainly different.  So I would not use the word 'redundant', but 'similar'.

I have to say that I just got it today and I'm really loving this quest! I think it's way more interesting than Carrock. It's great times trying to get the into the cave to get the Treasure cards! It's nice adding that optional bonus and I think really increases replayability. Well done FFG!!!

You can still collect resources and spend them even while sacked, as far as I can tell…

I thought that exhausting Narvi would be triggering an effect.  No?

Last night I changed my strategy a little bit more by waiting until I had a Troll Camp in the staging area before moving to 2.  Then I just left it there and ate the threat.  This allowed Bilbo to make quick work of the sacks and I never needed my Miners.  (Finally got the Treasures too!)

Do u find that Navri's belt is sufficient to pay all the costs for the three spheres or do u include any songs?

Narvi's Belt is only to pay for the Tactics cards, particularly the Erebor Battle Master.  I also have Ori and Nori for Spirit and Lore.  With a heavy dwarf deck, Thorin is pulling 2 resources every turn, and with Steward he's pulling 4.  Money is not an issue.  ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

 So there's no official difficulty in these quests? I only play solo, so I'm not sure if I want to get this expansion if they are too hard to solo with one deck.

The first and third are difficult, but they can be done solo.  Very fun quests.  I would definately reccomend getting them.

Is that right that Dain won't boost the dwarves when sacked? Because it says "can't trigger effects" I thought that only ment actions/response abilities. I've been playing that static abilities are still in effect.

You're playing it correctly. Static effects are never triggered, so Dain's boost will still work. In fact, since Dain can't exhaust while sacked, his ability will always be in effect. 

Also note that the sack cards only prevent characters from triggering their own effects; you can still make use of most attachments a sacked character may have.

Is it just me, or is the 3rd quest with Gollum - "Dungeons Deep, and Caverns Grim" actually quite difficult? I played this 2-player with my buddy and we got demolished with our themed decks. There's just so many ways to lose!

1. You can lose through threat level because you up it quickly by using Bilbo's Magic Ring to put extra resources on Bilbo for more "guesses" on the riddles. The riddles are even more difficult if you're running a triple-sphere deck, because it makes them even more difficult to guess correctly.

2. You have to reveal 2x (!?) the amount of encounter cards per player during the staging step (so 8 encounter cards in a 4 player game) so you can quickly be swarmed by enemies/treachery cards

3. Failing the riddles 3 times loses you the game instantly because Bilbo dies (and you can't heal Bilbo).

4. And to top it off, there's always at least 4 Threat (in a 2 player game) in the staging area because of Gollum's island location is in the staging area, and cannot be traveled to.

It's a brutal quest. Glaurung, you're gonna love it I think.

## 36 [Memetix on August 26, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69522-1st-hobbit-quest-solo/?do=findComment&comment=682206)

I threw together a tactics/leadership deck stuffed full of dwarves and used the new Beorn Hero. It has a high starting threat and I hadn't previewed the quest so I didn't know what was coming up. Bad move.

I quested through stage 1 in 3 turns and 2 of the trolls engage me and Sacked 2 heroes (I only had 1 ally out). I couldn't quest the next turn and the 3rd Troll engaged putting all my heroes in a sack. Game over.

So I tried again and played slower. By the time I had about 6 allies out (about 10 turns) including an erebor battle master I went for it.

All 3 Troll engaged (my threat was 43) on their first turn but I feinted 2 of them and sneaked out Gandalf to damage and then block the last one. Beorn hit it.

Next turn I played Gandalf to finish off the weaker troll meaning I could now attack them with more than 1 character. I killed one more this turn and the last one the next turn. There were 2 Troll Caves in the staging area so Bilbo was busy freeing sacked characters allowing me to do enough questing to stay alive but not enough to stop my threat increasing.

I had no time to hang around looking for a key or purse and felt a bit dissapointed but mightily relieved when the Sun suddenly came up. I was expecting more to happen in stage 3 …..

Is that right that Dain won't boost the dwarves when sacked? Because it says "can't trigger effects" I thought that only ment actions/response abilities. I've been playing that static abilities are still in effect.

 

 

You're playing it correctly. Static effects are never triggered, so Dain's boost will still work. In fact, since Dain can't exhaust while sacked, his ability will always be in effect. 

Also note that the sack cards only prevent characters from triggering their own effects; you can still make use of most attachments a sacked character may have.



Well…dammit! I think I might just give that scenario another try then! I suppose, thematically, his nearby presence will still provide a boost, even if he is stuck in A Smelly Sack, or whatever…

Dain, Nori and Ori were the trio I took with me in my first run-through of this today, despite the theme reservations. It went pretty well until Dain got sacked, losing the boost to all my other dwarfy allies (thank you, rich, I love that term!) and it was pretty much curtains from that point.

Is it just me, or is the 3rd quest with Gollum - "Dungeons Deep, and Caverns Grim" actually quite difficult? I played this 2-player with my buddy and we got demolished with our themed decks. There's just so many ways to lose!

1. You can lose through threat level because you up it quickly by using Bilbo's Magic Ring to put extra resources on Bilbo for more "guesses" on the riddles. The riddles are even more difficult if you're running a triple-sphere deck, because it makes them even more difficult to guess correctly.

2. You have to reveal 2x (!?) the amount of encounter cards per player during the staging step (so 8 encounter cards in a 4 player game) so you can quickly be swarmed by enemies/treachery cards

3. Failing the riddles 3 times loses you the game instantly because Bilbo dies (and you can't heal Bilbo).

4. And to top it off, there's always at least 4 Threat (in a 2 player game) in the staging area because of Gollum's island location is in the staging area, and cannot be traveled to.

It's a brutal quest. Glaurung, you're gonna love it I think.



 

Me and my buddy tried this quest 3 times last night and failed each time.  We were ok with the riddles but the Cave just adds so much threat plus the xtra cards that are revealed make it easy to get overwhelmed with enemies.  at least twice the two treacheries that 1) add two goblins to the staging area and 2) stop u from attacking enemies in the turn) where revealed together which basically just causes a slow painful death

On my first play through of the 3rd quest I ran out of player deck, I had gained control of the lake but my riddle progress was way behind. I started triggering the riddles where possible and having a 3 sphere deck it was hard work making much progress. I got hit by "Not fair" twice, both times removing 3 progress ….

Eventually I ran out of deck and therefore could never answer a riddle again.

Next play through I added an extra will of the west and a dwarven tomb to make sure I could recycle the deck and that made it all possible. Stage 3 was surprisingly difficult though, all the surge effects really piled out the goblins.

Overall, an excellent quest. I'm looking forward to replaying all the hobbit quests with 2 players now.

how does the riddle bit work? is it the same kind of mechanic that they used in the watcher in the water quest?

No, but it's somewhat similar. Each riddle effect will list criteria for you to "answer" (e.g., "The first player names a sphere and card type."). You then shuffle your player deck, discard a certain number of cards (dictated by the riddle effect) and add one progress to Stage 2B for each card that matches ALL the criteria on the riddle trigger. So, using the above example, you might call "Lore ally." You'd then shuffle and discard the top few cards (usually two or three), adding one progress for each Lore ally you discard. If you don't find any matches, Gollum attacks Bilbo. Lastly, Bilbo's Magic Ring allows the hobbit to spend his resources in order to discard additional cards during a riddle attempt.

Played the first scenario solo last night about 7 or 8 games. Failed every single one on the second stage. I cannot fathom out how you can do this. The trolls are too hard to kill more than one and my heroes just get sacked.

I tried the deck suggestions in the rules leaflet but those decks are just whack. I really don't know how to take this scenario on.

Play a deck that has lots of dwarf allies, three copies of Galadhrim's Greeting and three copies of Dwarven Tomb to recycle the Greetings.  When you Sneak Attack Gandalf reduce threat.

Slow play stage 1 until you are ready for stage 2.  You are not ready for stage 2 unless a copy of Troll Camp is in the staging area.  Do not explore it; take the threat hit.  Then Bilbo's job is to use his resources (which are almost useless otherwise) to remove sacks.  Put an Unexpected Courage on him or a Fast Hitch.  Play Path of Need on the Troll Cave.  With lots of dwarven allies Erebor Battle Master should be swinging a heavy stick and can take down a troll in one or two swings.

I use Thorin, Ori & Nori and am soon collecting many resources and cards.  With many allies out Ori and Nori often have time for Peace and Thought.  Don't forget to reduce your threat every time an ally comes into play.

This same deck also fairs well against the second adventure unless you draw an early Guffawing Giants.  The second adventure isn't so special imo.  I haven't had a chance at the third one yet.

Keep in mind that you don't actually have to kill any of the trolls. If you want, you can focus your deck around generating boatloads of willpower (Faramir, Astonishing Speed, etc.) and try to burn through the encounter deck.

Forgot to mention that.  I often don't quest at all during stage 1.  It's really easy to get too far ahead of yourself because SO much of the encounter deck is treacheries.  There is a card "Late to the Party?" or something like that that helps with this, but I don't use it.  You need lots and lots of threat reducers.

I finally beat this quest, had to kill all 3 trolls but never got the troll key, so i didn't discover the treasures (bummer!). had to use gandalf to lower threat, which allowed me to, for the most part, deal with one troll at a time. lots of the treacheries are nasty as they either raise your threat or sack you or force a troll to engage with you. nasty stuff. the battlemasters made relatively quick work of the trolls but i wasn't able to quest much to kind the key b/c i was needing to hold back defenders or attackers. oh, and having all of your attachments discarded really sucks, too! haha.  either way, it's a fun quest and i love the treasure hunting aspect as it really increases replayability!

Yeh i play solo and Henamarth is priceless so you can control the progress. The only snag is the treachery that deals a damage to allies which kills him so i try to keep back a Test of Will or two to cancel this.

That's what I ended up doing in the end. Threw everything into willpower and sped my way through the quest. Meant that I didn't get the treasures but hey. Maybe in a 2+ player game might be doable but right now I don't know how a solo deck could take the trolls on successfully.

Second quest seemed like a breeze until the third stage at which point I simply got mobbed by hordes of goblins and couldn't control them.

 My Hobbit themed dwarf deck did well against the first two quests, but got owned on the third.  I'm not even sure what I'm going to do to my deck to make it beatable.  I'm for sure going to try the new Gandalf and probably throw in some eagles as well.  It's a tough quest for a band dwarves though as the difficulty starts right away.  I'm really pleased with Quests 1 & 3, but 2 less so.

So close, but a Not Fair! Not Fair!  Followed closely by a What's in my Pocket? Led to my demise.  I had 8 progress on 2B, but Bilbo had 2 damage on him when I discarded 7 cards to Pocket.  Had I been able to discard an 8th I would have moved on to stage 3.  This is a good Quest.

Yeah, it really requires that you know your deck inside and out. You have to always be thinking about the chances of revealing any particular card type/sphere/cost. Even with a powerful build a la Elrond & Vilya, you're sunk if you can't answer those riddles correctly.

Using a dwarf deck with Nori makes the 1st quest pretty manageable.  I dont use the Galadrium's Greeting or use Gandalf's effect to lower my threat just because the sheer number of allies i can put in play lower my threat by more than enough…all i need to do is set up the allies then once Erebor Battle Master has enough to 1-shot a troll (or two shot with the help of record keeper) i can progress thru the trolls cleanly.

 Finally beat #3.  Took more than two hours and I wasn't stalling at all.  A couple of keys:

Getting Path of Need on Lake in the Cavern.

Next, lots and lots of one cost spirit events and then recycling the deck with Will of the West.  I really don't think the quest is doable without Will of the West.  It takes so long to get nine progress on 2B and you have to discard so many cards.

You know you are most funny player for me. I read many times your comments and almost all of them is declare you play this game quite long already but looks like you really dont know even basis rules. But your last comments is a grown of this!

How you can play Path of need on location which is immune to players card effect?  And how you can travel to Lake ???

Even if it was available to play PON to Lake is doesn work anyway cose PON never  can be Active location!!!

 I never travelled to the Lake.  I just played Path of Need on it.  Caleb has already ruled that PoN doesn't directly interact with the card it's attached to so it is legal to play it on it.  But you're right that PoN's effect only works when the location is active.  Back to the drawing board.

Anyway so how you can use POD if you cannot travel to Lake so POD is useless right? And i still dont understand how yo can play POD on location which one is immune to player card effect.

I have to agree with the comment about will of the west. My deck (Beorne, Ori, Nori) walked the first 2 quests but ran out of cards on the 3rd quest. I added a second will of the west and a dwarven tomb to address the problem.

I was surprised at how effective Beorn is, he was able to block when needed and the damage built up but he never got more than 7 in any of the games. I haven't tried him with any "non-hobbit" quests yet, but I'm looking forward to it.

I used a similar approach after I got my head around the quest, and managed to hack the big guys down after "slow-playing" the first stage.  I think the mechanic of blasting through the deck to symbolize the passing of the evening unto sunrise vs. trying to swarm the trolls was pretty ingenious.  As it happens, I had exactly 12 Dorfs out there.  How thematic was my victory - save perhaps for the use of Gimli.

Yes this is idea to get treasures. But i didn get exited about it. I dont care about treasures. My strategy is : start slowly, build up allies army, go to second quest, engage first troll, defend against him every round and meantime quest very active to discard all encounter deck. This strategy work very well but yes no treasures then. Anyway Hobbit is really cool i love it! This time FFG make cool job!

Has anybody been able to win the first quest solo using only 1 Core set and the Hobbit expansion?  I've got all of the APs to-date, but decided to challenge myself by trying to play the Hobbit with just the Core set and Hobbit cards.  So far, I've tried 5 times and have not yet been able to get past stage 2B, or for that matter kill a single Troll.  Not having access to the Song cards is hurting - I'm playing a tri-sphere Leadership (Thorin), Spirit (Nori), Tactics (Beorn) deck.  I'm close to surrendering and giving up on this approach.

 what state are the characters in when you remove the sack. Im thinking the way they were in when sacked. also troll camp says that bilbo can use the action even if he is sacked. So does that mean he can use it more then once since he is not exhausted or ready. Is it once per round. I'm thinking it's best just not to get sacked at all and leave the trolls in the staging area and quest a lot.

Any good ideas?  ( A Sneak Attack Beorn wouldn't be a bad play maybe.)

 



Ok, does the bolded part refer to Tom's card text? Because in my German version his text states that a troll can only be atacked by a single player at a time. Could anyone confirm that B.R. is right about that?

  Well, usually they translate the cards very good, but this time they really messed it up. One time they translate the word "character" with "ally" (on the sack cards), and one time with "player". I get the feeling that the translator hasn't played the game before translating it. Quest 1 is really only a kindergarden version in German…

 

Thanks for clearing that!

Actually, in English there is at least one of the "sack" cards that does mention an ally, so that may be translated correctly.

 Feel like I'm a bit late to the Hobbit party, having only just recently played the first two quests, but it seems FFG did an amazing job with these quests! First run through of Troll quest, and ended up engaged to all three trolls across the two teams of dwarves thanks to some nasty shadow effects. We almost got the first troll killed while only engaged with two of the trolls, only for the treachery that forces you to engage with a troll brought the last one in, and sacked enough characters to really push us.

Then, with glorious timing, the new Gandalf popped up (came into my partners hand at just the right moment, just like Gandalf), and in two turns of questing we managed, just, with nearly every ally dead from the trolls, to discard the last card from the deck, with our threat levels pushing 46 and 48, and Gandalf hanging around to finish off the job! Perfect combo of a win in good narrative fashion, and with defeat so near. I love the fact that the quest holds so true to the narrative of the Hobbit, and yet also makes it work in gameplay terms that are really satisfying. If FFG continues like this with quests (and the track record recently is so good with FoS etc) I'll be very happy!

I tried to do this solo tonight and basically threw in the towel when I saw 3 trolls in the staging area.  Between them and the sack effects, my whole party was going to get slaughtered.  I was using heroes from the saga expansion (2 dwarves plus that bear).  I wonder if it is like Conflict at the Carrock where you keep your threat ultra low and wait through the first part of the quest before engaging the trolls.  Any suggestions on winning this using the heroes and themes from the Saga expansion???

Sorry for the double post, but I have two more questions

1/ Do you mix the Treasure cards into the encounter deck and then "discover them"?  It seems that since they have rings on the back they would stick out when you are mixing up the encounter deck.

2/  Can you use 3 Gandalf cards from the core set AND the 3 new Gandalf cards from the saga expansion in the same deck?

1. Treasures are player cards and can be put into your player deck for scenarios 2 and 3 IF you can claim them during this quest.

2. The rules state only 3 cards with the same name per deck, so no you can't have 3 of both types of Gandalf.

 

As for tactics, I played a similar sounding deck to you and did very little questing in stage 1 so as not to complete it before I was ready. I had 2 trolls engage by then, but I had a troll camp in play and a fast hitch on Bilbo, so the sack cards were never a problem.

## 90 [leptokurt on September 19, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69522-1st-hobbit-quest-solo/?do=findComment&comment=696509)

I finally managed to beat the third quest on a regular basis. Inspired by Mementix's solo-sphere deck I created a two-sphere (spirit/leadership) deck with tons of 2 and 3 cost allies. Men, I didn't use Lorien Guide for ages! But that way I could finally solve these riddles before I ran out of cards (didn't need to use  Will of the West so far). My heroes were Dain/Nori/Dwalin which is a good combo to keep your threat low (<30).

 

The quest still feels overly complicated. I like fighting against the hordes of goblins, but the riddles feel like they've put too much new stuff into one quest. I like it better now but still the whole expansion doesn't give me that feeling of awesomeness like KD did. The news about HoN sounds promising though!

I tried about 10 times solo using just the cards from 1 core set and the hobbit expansion and did not have any luck.  I finally gave up and used some of the good tactics cards from the Darrowdelf cycle (e.g. Erebor BattleMaster, Heavy Stroke, Khazad!, Khazad!, etc.) and a couple of the key Neutral cards to help with making sure I can get the Troll Key in the unlucky case it gets put in the Discard pile if it comes up as a Shadow Card (e.g. Shadow of the Past, The End Comes).  The strategy I use is to avoid completing 1st quest phase until a Troll Camp comes up and I have enough allies to help with questing and defending against the trolls (cheap allies make good troll fodder).  Then as soon as I complete the 1st quest phase I travel to the Troll Camp (I used to avoid doing this as I wanted to ensure I didn't explore it and lose it from play, but then I realized a better strategy is to travel to it so that the threat level in the staging area comes down significantly and the first few rounds during the 2nd quest phase you don't really need to worry about over questing and exploring it anyways).  I then try to bring down the trolls one at a time to make it managable removing the sacks and leave the last troll alive until I have the troll key and have explored the troll cave.  With this approach I was able to improve my win rate, but it still took me quite a few more attempts before I successfully found the treasure (when I changed my strategy to travel to the troll camp right away that helped a lot).  My last game had an epic ending - the Troll Key was the 3rd last card in the encounter deck and I was in danger of discarding the last encounter card before I was able to explore the troll cave but I was able to use "The End Comes" to shuffle the encounter discard pile pack into the deck to allow me to find the treasures.  Never found a good use for the card until now!

I use a dwarf deck and heroes Beorn, Thorin, Nori and Bilbo to stick with the Hobbit theme.  The only non-hobbit ally I added was Arwyn so that I could use Elrond's Counsel for some extra threat reduction relief.

It feels like the Dwarrowdelf cycle is a must to survive the Hobbit quests with regularity. You'll find some of the other dwarves from the Hobbit in that cycle, too, I believe, so I picked the cycle packs up despite not liking the theme of the Dwarrowdelf quests.

At the very least get Erebor Battle Master, who is +1 attack for each Dwarf in play. He's in The Long Dark.

The funny part about my recent play-through [http://spontaneousderivation.com/2012/09/22/an-lotrlcg-saga-the-hobbit-we-must-away-ere-break-of-day/] (which makes use of this deck [http://spontaneousderivation.com/2012/09/22/an-lotrlcg-saga-the-hobbit-we-must-away-ere-break-of-day/www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=285&efcid=4&efidt=717553]) is that my threat was so high I ended up engaging the Trolls from hardest to least instead of the other way around, but that was alright because I had so many dwarf allies in play that there were plenty of sack targets other than the Battle Master. Card draw from Ori provided me with enough Khazad! Khazad!'s and Goblin-Cleavers and Dwarrowdelf Axes that the Battle Master ended up one-shotting each troll to the awe of Gimli and company.

I think engaging from most-HP to least also allowed me to one-shot the trolls one after another, because I lost one dwarf ally to blocking each turn. I only just made the kills each time.  I don't recommend this methodology, though.

It sounds like your deck worked really well, the battle master does make the final fight a lot easier.

I'm a bit confused how you managed to take on the trolls one at a time if your threat was so high, surely they would all have engaged you together i.e. on the same turn, adding 4 sacks (1 of which you could remove with Bilbo and a Troll Camp). Unless I've been playing it wrong, the only way to optionally engage them 1 at a time is to have your threat below 23.

It's actually CaffeineAddict's deck, not mine (and the link to it got messed up somehow in my previous post; here's the actual link [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=285&efcid=4&efidt=717553], unless I've messed up the URL again).

The most enemies that can engage you at a time is two: one is optional and your choice, the other forced. Take a look at the engagement rules again; I was forced to engage a Troll, the highest threat one possible that was still at or under my threat (which was in the 40s, so it had to be the biggest, hairiest one). But only one. Otherwise the game would, indeed, be extremely, extremely hard.

I wanted to add a clarification here: that's the most enemies that can join the possibly monstrous cadre currently beating your party. If I hadn't one-shotted the biggest troll, the next biggest would have joined him on my next turn, and on the next turn after that, the smallest one. I could have indeed three trolls beating on me, it just takes three turns to accumulate them.

This is very wrong. Check the rulebook again, page 16:

"Once all players have made an engagement check, the first player makes a second engagement check. Players continue making engagement checks in this manner until there are no enemies remaining in the staging area that can engage any of the players."

So if your threat was at 40, all 3 trolls are engaging you (assuming you are playing solo obviously).

I am playing solo, but rather than one deck I am playing 2 (Simulating 2 players).  I actually replicated the 2 decks on the back of the over hill, underhill booklet which use the cards from the core and the Saga edition.

Here are some thoughts,

I think I rushed through the first quest phase too fast.  I need more cards to engage the trolls

This feels like a refined version of "Conflict of Carrock", start slowly, build up an army and keep your threat low, then move in to engage the trolls.  Probably using Gandalf from the Core would be a good way to reduce threat, as well as other threat reducing cards. 

Gimli will probably be my MVP with a suit of armor, since he will be able to dish out enough damage to kill the trolls very quickly.

You need lots of allies in play to act as defense fodder against the trolls

The one thing that really really bothers me is Tom (the Troll's) special ability, that Trolls can only be attacked by one character at a time.  This would make the game a nightmare because it would take teamwork to destroy the Trolls in the first place (having 3 attack one for instance).  I can understand not being allowed to use attachments, otherwise using "Forest Trap" would make this too easy.  Attacking one at a time means that their health can only be bled slowly.  If anyone can clarify this I would appreciate it.

wlk is right - all three trolls will engage you when our threat is too high. There is no restriction to the number of enemies that can engage you.

Well, I only play solo, but I think the same strategies should apply to two player games. When playing this scenario I usually try to keep my threat low enough so that I only have to fight one of the trolls at a time. I think everything else will not work, no matter how good your deck might be.

My first deck was built around Dáin as the main defender, pimped up with some Dunedain Warnings, Chain Mails and Arwen. The troll killer was Erebor Battle Master, who had an attack value of 7-10 with all these dwarves in play. So the plan was to delay the second stage until I had EBM and enough dwarves out, but not delaying it too long to avoid a fight with two trolls. Khazad-Khazad and Heavy Stroke are nice cards that help EBM to kill the trolls with one single blow. Instead of EBM you might also use Gimli + Citadel Plate.

My second deck was spirit/lore with the aim to play as many cheap allies with much WP as possible. Westroad Traveller, Erebor Record Keeper, Escort from Edoras, Arwen etc. Some of them got sacrificed to the trolls, the others allowed me to quest like the wind so that I gathered enough progress to complete the adventure before the trolls could even blink.

Btw, both stragies also work against S&F.

 

In your case I'd say that you should combine these two with one player defending (and perhaps attacking) and the other one questing. Remember you don't need to defeat the trolls, as the sunlight will take care of them once you have enough progress.

 

Re: Gandalf - I used the new version but it was quite counter-productive in this (in fact in all three) scenario which is why I dropped him. The old Gandalf might help, but since FoS I don't use him anymore. If you want to use him though, you probably should add Grave Cairn to your deck. Play Gandalf with Sneak Attack (or with Born Aloft) and use his ATT for one of your other characters.

That is the missing point!  I thought that to pass through this quest you had to physically defeat all three Trolls.  Questing and eventually beating all 3 because you got all of the event cards makes this quest sooooo much easier.  Thank you so much for clarifying this for me.  I have not read the hobbit for several years so I forgot what happened in the book.

These scenarios are good, but there are many moving parts.  After I finish all 3 Hobbit scenarios in sequence, I am going old school back to the original core set and playing them again.

I played again.  I find the most challenging is balancing the questing progress and the level of threat.  Quest too much and you run into the Trolls to early, quest too little and your threat goes up to high.  There are many treachery cards which send your threat level up. 

Playing with more players is better too because it "burns up" encounter cards faster, thereby making the second part of the game easier to overcome with a high level of questing. 

 

BTW, which are the best cards to managing threat?

I played again.  I find the most challenging is balancing the questing progress and the level of threat.  Quest too much and you run into the Trolls to early, quest too little and your threat goes up to high.  There are many treachery cards which send your threat level up. 

Playing with more players is better too because it "burns up" encounter cards faster, thereby making the second part of the game easier to overcome with a high level of questing. 

BTW, which are the best cards to managing threat?

 

 

Elrond's Counsel (The Watcher in the Water) - but you need a unique Noldor character for it (such as Arwen, who is good for multiplayer as well). Will give some other character +1 WP and reduce threat by 3.

The Galadhrim's Greeting (Core) - reduce multiple player threats by 2, or reduce a single player's threat by 6.

Gandalf (Core) - he can reduce threat by 5.

Ever Onward (Khazad Dum) - not a threat reducer per se, but keeps you from increasing threat due to questing unsuccessfully.

ETA: Lore Aragorn (The Watcher in the Water): resets your threat to your starting threat.

I also played again with the same deck and the correct engagement rules this time. I managed my threat better and ended up engaging only two of the trolls at once (gah). A surprise Gandalf managed to keep my threat low enough so that the third troll did not join next turn (turn after that, though, I had three trolls). Ended up killing all three, but it was a very, very close thing. After running through the available, unsacked cannon fodder (woefully reducing the Battle Master's prowess), two feints kept the party alive, at least the part that was unsacked.

Final threat: 46, ouch

Turns: 7

Dead heros: Bifur, killed in the sack :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png] 7 threat

Damage on Gimli: 3

Victory: all three trolls for 12 points

Obtained the Troll Purse but didn't manage to get the Key, not that Bilbo had any resources left to pay for Key use anyways.

Now I want to make a Quest Like the Frickin' Wind deck.

The Troll Key is obtained not by spending resources but by exhausting Bilbo after an attack that damages the troll carrying it.

I know that; but even if I did get it, it would be useless, because of this on Troll Cave:

"Players cannot travel to Troll Cave unless Bilbo Baggins has the Troll Key attached and the first player spends 5 [baggins] resources. (2 [baggins] resources instead if Bilbo Baggins has the Troll Purse attached.)"

Bilbo had no resources left and I was clean running out of time and allies. sad.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sad.gif]

This is a tough scenario.  I tried several times with the two decks on the back of the booklet, but the threat levels go too high even before you engage the trolls.  Too many cards do things like add Doom to the track and kill your allies.  I tried again with a single deck and tried to keep my threat low but that did not seem to work either.

Any suggestions, I assume I am playing this right because it looks really hard.  How did you guys win?  I would hate to have to bust my credit rating to have to get more decks.

Here are my thoughts, for what they're worth.

To survive this quest, you need good threat management. That almost certainly means running Core Gandalf (rather than new Gandalf, unless you have threat under really good control), definitely Galadhrim's Greetings, and at least one Dwarven Tomb to recycle a Greeting. If you run with Nori, every dwarf you play will reduce  your threat by 1---a big advantage if you're running almost all dwarven allies.

The dwarf heroes in OHaUH have synergy with large numbers of dwarves in a deck---Ori draws cards based on having five+ dwarves in play, and Thorin does the same for his excess resource generation. This is why the set resonates so well with the Dwarrowdelf cycle. Every additional dwarven ally counts.

Even without the Dwarrowdelf cycle, though, there are still a lotta dwarven allies.

I think you can do things with Thorin, Ori, and Nori; and as many dwarven allies as possible. That gives you Spirit, Leadership, and Lore: and gives you resource generation, card draw, and threat reduction. Card draw will be particularly essential to getting any deck off the ground, and you need every draw in this quest. You want five dwarves in play STAT as soon as possible; fortunately, you can get your pick of cheap dwarves with Zigil Miner, Erebor Record Keeper, Miner of the Iron Hills, Erebor Hammersmith. More expensive dwarves like the Longbeard Map-Maker and Longbeard Orc Slayer are hardier, and with excess resource generation from Thorin, the Slayer can be more reliably played.

Stick in the Galadhirm's Greetings and the Dwarven Tomb. Add in more card draw support, like Ancient Mathom. Remember that Gandalf (Core) can also give you cards. Durin's Song will help, as may Ever Onward. You also have access to Dunedain Mark. And naturally Steward of Gondor. If you have a Song of Wisdom on Thorin, you need not worry about not having enough resources to pay for Lore allies.

I came up with a decklist containing nothing but cards from 1x each of Core, Mirkwood Cycle, and Khazad-Dum, ETA: and Over Hill & Under Hill. I also tested it out.

Here's the deck:

Hero (3)
Nori (OHaUH) x1
Ori (OHaUH) x1
Thorin Oakenshield (OHaUH) x1


Ally (25)
Gandalf (Core) x3
Brok Ironfist (Core) x1
Dori (OHaUH) x2
Erebor Hammersmith (Core) x2
Erebor Record Keeper (KD) x3
Fili (OHaUH) x2
Kili (OHaUH) x2
Longbeard Map-Maker (CatC) x3
Longbeard Orc Slayer (Core) x2
Miner of the Iron Hills (Core) x2
Zigil Miner (KD) x3


Attachment (13)
Song of Wisdom (CatC) x3
Protector of Lorien (Core) x2
Steward of Gondor (Core) x1
Unexpected Courage (Core) x1
Ancient Mathom (AJtR) x3
Dunedain Mark (THfG) x3


Event (12)
A Test of Will (Core) x2
Durin's Song (KD) x3
Dwarven Tomb (Core) x1
Ever Onward (KD) x2
Hasty Stroke (Core) x2
The Galadhrim's Greeting (Core) x2

Running it against the first scenario, I actually managed to win. But it was an extremely close win---this deck is fragile preciseley because some of the best cards from Core only have two copies. A Test of Will and The Galadhrim's Greeting stands out among these cards. However, I managed to pile in enough dwarves and dwarven allies to keep the dwarf synergy with the heroes going after turn 2.

Some highlights:

- The Galadhrim's Greetings could not have come later and still have me win the game. It was, like I said, a very close thing. They kept me from having two trolls engaged at the same time.

- Gandalf was also, for some reason, in the second half of the deck. Good thing Ori had serious card draw; at the end of the game, only three cards were left in my deck.

- Fili and Kili popping out together was a surprisingly huge help. 2 dwarves for 3 cost is amazing.

- A Test of Will was so necessary to deal with treachery-heavy decks that I recycled one with the Dwarven Tomb. Hasty Stroke also helped, since some of the shadow effects are equally nasty.

- I had no choice---I had to engage the trolls from least to greatest. Things got easier after the second troll died.

- Bilbo kept sacks away. Thorin was a sack magnet, so I had to exhaust Bilbo and pay threat to keep trolls engaged. :-/

- Unsacked by Bilbo, Thorin had two Dunedain Marks on him, and with plentiful application of Durin's Songs, managed to kill the smallest and the middle trolls before I took on the big guy (who I actually chose to engage for once).

- Protector of Lorien played a huge roll in keeping threat down during the endgame with the trolls by turning card draw into will power. The Map-Makers also helped---every Lore resource helped.

- With the final troll engaged to me already and killing one of my allies, a final Gandalf managed to damage him and then, with the help of Thorin, kill him.

- I got the Key, but it was attached to the final troll and everybody was too busy killing him to explore the Cave properly. Closest I have ever gotten to the treasures.
 

Edit: final score -

Threat: 37
Dead heroes: 0
Wounds: 0
Victory points: 12
Turns: 14

so… 165. I seem to hit that pretty regularly.

I had a similar deck when I played, I finally got it.  Here were some thoughts on how to win

Gandalf (Core set), Sneak attack, Galadrim's greeting, and Dwarven tomb were essential to keeping threat low

Having 5 dwarves in play was essential to activate the special powers of Thorin, Ori, and Nori

Secret paths was essential in round two when the trolls appear to eliminate the threat levels of any locations once the questing sprint appears. 

Henmarith Riversong is essential in a solo game.  He basically allows the player to manage every encounter before it appears.  This helps time exactly how long one needs to stay at the first part of the game. 

I found that it is best to save your allies until the second part of the quest when the trolls appear, there are too many treachery cards which will kill your allies before that.  In addition, there is nothing in the first part of the quest that your heroes cannot handle. 

Once the Trolls appear, activate EVERYONE to the quests (including Gandalf) and make a mad dash to eliminate every remaining encounter card.

I played for a really long time.  I basically played until I had most of my cards. 

Burglar Baggins is really only used at the second part of the quest when the Trolls appear. 

My impression is that fighting the trolls is too risky.  Considering that you can only use one person to attack (Because of Tom) and cannot use attachments, makes a long drawn out melee too dangerous.
