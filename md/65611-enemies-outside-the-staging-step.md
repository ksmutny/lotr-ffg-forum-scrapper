Thalin, Core Set hero, reads:

"While Thalin is committed to a quest, deal 1 damage to each enemy as it is revealed by the encounter deck."

now, the thing that's been bugging me for a while is this: If an enemy is added to the staging area at any other time than the staging step: i.e. shadow cards which say "add this enemy to the staging area" - do they still get the damage?

I guess the thing it depends on, is whether Thalin is still committed to the quest, even though you've long since resolved the willpower vs threat and moved on? or is he only counted as being committed to the quest during the questing phase?

 

any thoughts?

 Core rule book, page 14: "Characters committed to a quest are considered committed to that quest through the end of the quest phase, unless removed from the quest by a card effect."

Hope that clears things up a bit.

EDIT: Oh, too slow!

Note also the nuance that (as per the FAQ), a card is only considered to have been "revealed from the encounter deck" (as Thalin requires) if the relevant effect specifically uses the word revealed. "Added to the staging area" wouldn't allow Thalin to hit an enemy.

Example: if an enemy is added to the staging area by Cave Torch during questing, this enemy would not take a damage from Thalin.
