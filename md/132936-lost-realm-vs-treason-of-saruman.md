Since they are (hopefully) coming pretty close together, I'm curious which one folks are more excited for...Personally, I think I'm a bit more excited for The Lost Realm. Setting is awesome looking, like the idea of side quests and I'm really excited for the emphasis on the Dunedain player cards.

How about everyone else?

Lost Realm. But that is not to say I am not also excited about Treason of Saruman!

Lost Realm, I love getting totally new content compared to an already told story. The Dunedain stuff looks awesome and having all the APs to go with it! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Well, although right now I'm more hyped for The Lost Realm, I think it's mainly because we have more of an idea of what's going to be in it. Whereas with ToS, we have what, three player cards spoiled? Two of which don't really count because they are in the Fellowship Sphere. So, I think as it comes closer to both coming out and as more spoiler articles come, I'll be pretty excited for both.

I'm more excited for Treason of Saruman, mostly because I'm probably more likely to use cards from it in my current decks. My top decks are a Rohan deck and a Silvan deck and I expect support for Rohan and a new Legolas.

The Lost Realm. As I've already stated in other threads, I'm excited about more Dúnedain and hopefully Noldor, and any new heroes we might encounter. 

 

I'd be more excited about the Treason of Saruman if I had actually completed the earlier Saga expansions. I have both The Black Riders and The Road Darkens, but we haven't yet beaten A Knife in the Dark...

Treason of Saruman!

The Lost Realm. Simply because the spoilers have been aimed more toward the player cards whereas Treason of Saruman has focused on the quests (as they probably should for a saga box).

The Lost Realm. Because it's 100% that Saruman hero won't be released in the Treason of Saruman box :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Also, undead.

The lost realm, I always wondered what Arnor looked like.

Halbarad was always one of my favorite characters. I hope his hero version and art are amazing! My love for Leadership will be even greater once we get him.

I'm really excited for Treason of Saruman. I'm interested to see how the captive thing works out and what they've come up with for spliting the campaign into two branches. Also excited to see if there's a new Legolas.

I would like to see how they will implement two-colored heroes.

Lost Realm.

Side quests looks like a great new addition.

Dunedain & Arnor setting.

That doesn't mean I'm not looking forward to Treason of Saruman too though.

I do hope this saga box will be better filled player card wise...

At the risk of appearing naive...Is this really a thing that is happening?

That's just the thing I'm suspecting. Saga boxes used to have 1 hero for each sphere. Then, The Road Darkens broke the rule introducing a neutral hero, BUT this hero could be played with literally any sphere, so he can be considered 4-colored hero. And that's why I'm suspecting that the reason they lowered the number of heroes in the Treason of Saruman to 2 is because each hero will represent two spheres at once in some way. All my speculation and suspicion, though.

That would certainly open some interesting deck building possibilities...there would probably need to be something to offset how potentially powerful it would be...something like must share each of its dual spheres with another hero in the deck (limiting a deck to 2 spheres, but having more flexibility with resources), or a really high threat, or some other effect.  

 

Neat idea though.

So, you don't even use Gandalf or other stuff from the box?

I'm enjoying the saga quests, so while i am looking forward to the lost realm, I'm more excited for The Treason of Saruman. Can't wait to defend Helm's Deep.
