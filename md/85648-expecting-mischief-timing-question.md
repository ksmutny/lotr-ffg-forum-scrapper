# [Expecting Mischief Timing Question](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85648-expecting-mischief-timing-question/)

So first up--sorry if this has already been answered. On phone so it's hard to check.

 

My question is simple--does expecting mischief trigger before or after an encounter cards "when revealed" effect? Also, does it trigger before keywords like "surge" or "doomed" like Thalin does (I assume not  based on the different language)?

 

Thanks in advance for the help!

Good question. Should be same as Thalin but im not sure here…….

Yeah, I'm not sure either.  But the language is different.  I would probably resolve Expecting Mischief after the When Revealed or Surge effects on a card.  Thalin says "as it is revealed," but Expecting Mischeif lacks that language.

Maybe the keyword Action can be used in this instance to determine this card´s timing?

Like an event you play beforehand and it lingers/hovers around the staging area waiting for it´s condition to be met but unlike a response it can only be activated the next time there is an action window?

That would put the effect off till after the staging step though but it´s a thought.

Hmm--and here I was hoping for an easy answer :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 
The confusion for me is that Thalin (that DOES take effect before keywords and "when revealed" effects) is specifically worded to say that the damage is placed "as" revealed. Expecting Mischief, however is simply worded "first enemy revealed". 
 
Normally I would say that this would clearly mean that keywords and enemy "when revealed" effects would trigger first as the action window for you to play an event is AFTER encounter cards are revealed. BUT in the case of Expecting Mischief, the card is already played and is engaging in its effect even before encounter staging.
 
So…yeah. No idea. Honestly though if it DOESN'T trigger first the card is a bit crap (yeah, yeah--Denathor and Henamarth (sp?), but that is limiting utility).
 
Anyway--any other ideas? I may just have to email FF.

UPDATE!

I contacted FF and Caleb dropped me a line to clear things up.

Official word is that as the effect comes into play BEFORE any encounter card is revealed it triggers before keywords and "when revealed" effects. If the enemy is destroyed, those effects never trigger.

Great, great news for this card. Now an auto-include for me in all 3 or 4 player games where I have any lore.

Now that I think about it though, I have another question--this time about its interaction w/ Thalin. As they are simultaneous effects could the first player chose to NOT trigger Expecting Mischief against a 1hp enemy by triggering Thalin's effect first an killing it? Would that allow Expecting Mischief to trigger on the next enemy revealed or would it simply not trigger?

Hmmmm...

nice!

as to the 2nd, i would say no.....if it was a response you could chose, but it isnt. i would say it just all goes to the first enemy

perhaps i am wrong so i would see what others think first

i asked a similar question recently

"....when i reveal a 2 health enemy, and have expecting mischeif and ranger spikes in staging....what happens? am i correct in thinking that the 2 damage kills it before it 'hits' the staging area, meaning the spikes arent attatched so are eligble for the next enemy?

the spikes says 'enters the staging area' but i dont think they do if they die"

Yeah--kind of think it won't fly. But then again if Thalin's ability triggers "as" it's revealed and resolves then it may never be revealed to be a target for Expectig Mischief. Hmmm.....

If ranger spikes and expecting mischief are in the staging area together would that come under the 'simultaneous action' rule? Thereby the first player choosing which happens first? So technically you could have the expecting mischief kill a 2 hp or lower enemy and then still have the spikes remain in the staging area and attach to the following enemy? Or in the case of more than two hp's the enemy would be damaged as well as stuck in the spikes?

i would say no, as mischief triggers 'when revealed' but spikes is when it hits staging area. i seem to remember the new FAQ having something about spikes
