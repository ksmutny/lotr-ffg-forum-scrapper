One question.

When can this be purchased from you guys?

I'm waiting to place an order, not only for the core game, but the first action pack as well and on the website, I get not yet available.

I've seen on the forums that some folks have talked about pre-ordering but I am having difficulty with that link, if there is one.

Thanks!

I can't speak for FFG, but there are multiple vendors on Amazon and eBay who have the game for sale and ready to ship, just search for "lord of the rings card game".

Full disclosure - I'm one of the eBay vendors.

Thanks for the advice.

I did just that, and found an e-bay seller and purchased the game.

 Henceforth, I am calling the expansions "action packs"

Just thought I'd share that.

I am wondering though since most other vendors already shipped between 16th and 18th of April!

Still 30 April listed at my FLGS llorando.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/llorando.gif] . And ordering from overseas won't really speed things up anyways, especially with Easter just around the corner.

Ah, Maelstrom (UK) have the same release date.

I've had WFRP stuff on pre-order from Maelstrom before, and I've found that when its released earlier than expected, their release dates don't always get updated. When I've spoken to the shop, they have said they rely on the main distributor for release dates, and don't always get told if these change, although that could well be down to Maelstrom rather than the distributor.

Anyway I think the UK distributor (Esdevium) is also responsible for Europe, so it may be Fantasiapelit simply haven't got an updated release date?

Could be worth checking with them if you haven't already, to ensure they know the game has been released already. I've done that with Maelstrom a couple of times in the past and then they managed to get hold of my pre-order from the distributor, and ship it a few days later, and updating their release date at the same time.

I think they know. Whenever I inquire about an FFG game, as to when it comes out, all they can say is "whenever it comes out", meaning FFG release dates aren't all that accurate from their experience.

I think there have been instances where some UK suppliers order their copies direct from the suppliers/printers, so that those game come straight the UK, instead of making a round trip to FFG first.
