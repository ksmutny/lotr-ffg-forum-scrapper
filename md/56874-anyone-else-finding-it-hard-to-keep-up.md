Although I do have a backlog it is mainly due to Christmas shopping and new baby stuff taking priority.

It is certainly financially a lot easier to keep up with LotR than it was when I was playing Magic (or Vs. System) and there a 1000s of cards I don't have playsets of in thoses games from sets when I was investing £100+...

I have more trouble keeping up playing a quest before the next one comes out. Next week, Dead Marshes, then I still have Dol Guldur (and Osgiliath) to fully play through, but I'm guessing Return to Mirkwood comes out before I've finished those 12-18 plays (normally one play per day).

Money is not a factor for me, but time is. There are still other great games to play...

Same here. And if I decide to play the Star Wars game next year, it will get even worse.........

I made the mistake to try the A Game of Thrones LCG while waiting for the Dead Marshes to arrive here in Austria. Boy, that was a mistake I think, cause it looks like this will be eating a lot of time as well in the future...

It's already sometimes hard to find enough time for all the great games out there. Currently I'm also buying all Thunderstone and Nightfall expansions as well, but LOTR is my top priority when it comes to bringing the new stuff to the table.

So keeping up with the output of the Adventure packs can be difficult at times, but then again: We usually have to wait a bit longer than most players in the US, so that gives my playgroup enough time to beat the quests several times...

What I'm more worried about right now is the amount of cards that never get played. I mean my gf and I have our two decks (Leadership/Lore and Spirit/Tactics) and we tinker a bit with them, but never really get to try out all the new player cards... which is a shame in my opinion.

On that point, when i get a new pack i make a point of trying everything out in that pack, even if i dont like the card, but i only play this game, so i have all the time i want to tinker back and forth

I haven't bee able to play much, yet I still get every AP when they're released. I've only played Dead Marshes once and I haven't even played Return to Mirkwood yet despite having it for nearly a week or 2. I mostly blame Skyrim. lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif]

I have more trouble finding people to play with and the time to play than I do purchasing the new packs. In fact, I've been purchasing both Warhammer: Invasion and LotR packs and I'm considering splurging a few hundred dollars on AGoT but I really need to find some people to play with or a regular playtime for the people I know who will play.

 I'm in grad school right now so time and money are both very short.  I also just got JtR and it is tough avoiding spoilers here in the forums for the last three Mirkwood APs.  

 

The new Moria expansion set looks awesome, but I was sad to realize that continuing with this game is going to require quite a bigger an investment than I was lead to believe when I bought the core set.  Perhaps that's a result my own lack of perception due to giddiness :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]  

 

Some how or other I'm going to try to keep playing this game as well as play the new Star Wars LCG when that comes out next year.  Wish me luck!

Agreed. I'm not worried, though, between Christmas and New Year's Day I typically have plenty of time to catch up.

I've pretty much pencilled that period for Gears of War (six plays, one per day). Since a rotation of six plays for LotR also takes six days, not enough to get plays during that period sad.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sad.gif] . I suppose if I lose one fast and early, might play two plays, but that's the limit as then each of my four decks have been in action and seeing the same deck twice in one day is too boring to consider playing again.
