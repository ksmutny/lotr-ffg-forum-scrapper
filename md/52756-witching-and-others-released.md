will the gen con scenario cards be re-released in other packs? i find it hard to believe that important characters such as the witch king and places such as osgiliath have already been released, not even in an official pack, and wont be included in future mordor adventure packs.

Once Massing at Osgilliath  goes up on the Print on Demand page, you'll be able to buy the whole expansion cheaply that way. No need to see them reprinted in other sets.

 There is still a possibility they will be reprinted into other expansions as well.  They may have different effects though.  The Journey to Rosgobel expansion comes with another version of Black Forest Bats that has the same stats as the original, but a different power that fits the theme of the quest better.

yes i just found it strange that a massive character would only be released on print on demand quality
