 See subject.

Or is it just me?

Probably because the comments sections often led to lengthy, informative discussions, which you would want on the forum for easy reference to other players. At least, that's one reason.

yeah i never got discussing it on the news page- you couldnt quote or reply to others etc. but leaving comments there would have been nice

i mean its not like we didnt just open up threads on here anyways- well i at least always used to be one of the first to view the news per week and used to open threads- that was before these randomly timed articles- I MISS MONDAY NIGHT PREVIEW Wahhhh llorando.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/llorando.gif]

oh yeah loving the nameless things- way to go ffg on using that little known creatures, shows you really care about the little (or really big) things in middle earth. gotta love me some middle earth mysteries

 I always liked the ability to comment on the announcement. It made it easier to find out what people thought about the the product. This blind redirect isn't the greatest thing (Is there even a thread about the new Adventure pack?), but I suppose FFG wants more people to post on the forums. Considering some of the negative posts in recent announcements (specifically Mansions of Madness and all the "why are you announcing X when none of the packs from the set are available yet) it might be to control some of the responses.

I think I prefer the comments getting consolidated in a forum post.. but the news item should link directly to a thread on the subject NOT just to the forum.

I liked reading the comments. It gave a quick first impression what others would think about the news or the product.

 I thought the elder nameless thing (or whatever it was called) looked interesting - the more powerful cards you run, the harder it is to kill - it'll play havoc with the Ziggy/Gildor deck I just built based around last week's article...

However, it only gets the attached cards only after engagement.  It has only 4 hit point when in the staging area, and is the perfect target of Gandalf.

or a marked dunhere... that guy is a superstar.... it can also be feint / snared and then it is THE  best thing for use with infighting, as you could stack enough dmg on it that you could instant kill any creature in the game.. so in fact this card could be a really good thing ofr you to pull with a ton of resources.
