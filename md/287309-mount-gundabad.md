My take on the ones not fully revealed...

Round Shield - Tactics Attachment, 0 Cost, Item Armor - Attach to a character. Restricted. Response: After a shadow effect is triggered during combat, exhaust Round Shield to give attached character +2D for this attack.

Drinking Song - Lore Event, 0 Cost, Song - Action: Count the number of cards in your hand and shuffle your hand into your deck. Then, draw an equal number of cards plus 1 additional card if you control a unique Hobbit character.

Erebor Toymaker - Spirit Ally, 3 Cost, Dwarf Craftsman - Response: After you play Erebor Toymaker from you hand, reduce the cost of the next attachment played this phase by 1.

But this Bilbo seems good on the first glance. Of course sometimes there is no enemy in the staging area but most of the time he will be questing for 3+ with a potential to deal damage: that for 9 threat in Tactics seems a great deal.

## 8 [lleimmoen on December 4, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/287309-mount-gundabad/?do=findComment&comment=3557530)

Also, Drinking Song seems amazing with a Hobbit. Actually fully playable without but otherwise amazing.

New Bilbo hero rocks.

9 threat in tactic is quite standard and basically Bilbo equals to a 3-5 willpower hero which is totally great. Him plus Eowyn means tactic can really quest now for a mere 15 initial treath.¬†

Sometimes you don't have enemies in staging area to trigger it's effect, sure, but won't be often. And hobbit pony exist for a reason.¬†

The add in extra damage to guarding enemy is very fun.

Gaffer Gamgee ally is great. 2 cost questing ally with a disposable feint effect in lore is huge although conditional. Not even discarded like Grimbold so you can pay it again next round.¬†¬†

Can Bilbo's response be used against an enemy that's immune to player card effects? The first part seems to target Bilbo himself but the part about dealing damage might not work. I'm not sure.

The whole "choose an enemy" part is leaving me to think neither will work.

Damage won't work, sure.¬†

I think also the first effect won't apply but I might be wrong should Bilbo be considered the target and the chosen enemy not.

A bit underwhelmed with Biblo on first blush, after some thought though....there is no limit cap.¬† There are 4, 5, and 6 threat enemies. Nightmare mode could make him even better.¬† Boy Thrors ring and Bilbo are some thinkers.¬† Lot of possibilities¬†

Ranger spikes are not his friend, doesnt say printed threat. Dont put him in a fellowship with Argalad either, they work against each other. Thalin would work though and anborn. (For the damage part)

22 enemies with 5 or more threat. Mostly bosses, who engage immediately. So look at mostly having a plus 4 as a cap

You are right....

Ok still ¬†+3 avg means a eowyn like ¬†4 willpower in tactic. Not bad and the consistent 1 damage can be more significant than it appears at first glance.

I have to say it. Bilbo hero sucks for 9 threat! 9! With stats of 1 1 2 2! Not again!

The only way I see him being of use is with a hobbit ponny really.

Ah ah ah.

This time at least his stats are *actually* equal to his likely stats.

Ok not super as ability but in tactic it can bring some benefits.¬†

He is a great burglar. Put sting on him, play a guarded card, quest and cancel that threat gain, deal 2 damage to the enemy, defend the enemy and deal sting damage. Or have some staging area attack. Keep threat low and rack up powerful guarded cards. Of course this is best case scenario type stuff¬†

Seems like you would need spirit and lore for fast hitch and hobbit pony though.

Now we have the Necklace of Girion, the Arkenstone, Orcrist, Glamdring, Sting and Thr√≥r's Ring, of which all are mentioned in the Hobbit aside from the last one. I wonder what the last guarded attachment will be: very likely Spirit, as all other spheres have one already. The last remaining treasure cards from Over Hill and Under Hill are not interesting and important enough to be guarded attachments though. And while the Sceptre of Ann√∫minas and the Elendilmir both would fit into Spirit they have nothing to do with the Hobbit or Rhovanion. Is there any other item in Middle-earth that could be a guarded Spirit attachment?

Oh man, why did they leave Bilbo at nine threat?¬†
Tactics Eowyn has 4 willpower from the get go (meaning she can do other stuff like one of these annoying hide tests etc.)¬†and a powerful ability. While different I would rank Bilbos ability lower in terms of power. Two damage is great as it opens up some neat tricks with Gondorian spearman and spear of the citadel, but how often do enemies guard stuff? Sure there are a handful of player cards and some quests, making it¬† quite niche. And dealing one damage is not too great. Argalad already does something very similar and profits from stuff like light of valinor etc. Ofc he is in lore and usefull quester shouldn't be too common in tactics, but other spheres are more generous in adding "out of sphere stats" I feel.
Bilbo probably will be good in mono tactics anyway for the (most likely) above avarage willpower, but with 6 or seven willpower I would have been much more happy. Would have made him more interssting for secrecy, too (and this is his Burgluar version, so he should be sneaky). This way I don't see why I shouldn't just pick Eowyn, if I want one tactics hero (with high willpower and low threat), as she is more constant and can really be a life saver against high health enemies.

Love the general Hobbit support in this pack though :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Let me state that I don't think Bilbo to be Grimbeorn or Eowyn in terms of power but I like him all the same.¬†

Bilbo is the hobbit with higher effective willpower with ability to damage enemy in staging area. A couple of turns plus sting on Sam means 3 damage which is enough to dispatch a lot of orcs enemy.¬†

I think we are now close to be able to play two hobbit decks against many quest. ¬†

I really like the potential of hobbit pony on him. If you run him and thalin, you could drop two damage on enemy when they are revealed from the encounter deck.¬†

Bilbo is clearly meant to be played with Sting. Get it out of your deck, play it, attach it to the next enemy (no location) and Bilbo takes care of it on his own, as long as your threat is low enough and the enemy is not immune. Bilbo also makes sure, that the threat of the extra enemy does not count (sort of) and as soon as it is dead, attach Sting to Bilbo and he has the stats fitting his threat cost, not counting his quest boost. And before someone complains, that he needs an attachment to be worth his stats, look at Galadriel: While she has an awesome ability, she cannot use her willpower for questing, so without Nenya she is even more overpriced than Bilbo (5 extra threat compared to 3). And yet this has not stopped her from being a top hero.

I think Bilbo's 9 would be easier to take if he could also find Guarded cards in your deck.¬† As is he's overcosted again, and since the neutral card is known it won't be a Bilbo-specific attachment that reduces the threat of both versions.¬† OTOH, the neutral card *does* at least allow Bilbo to partake in Hobbit secrecy decks, since Bilbo+Shirefolk+Hobbit+Hobbit is <20 threat.¬† Both Bilbo's extra card and Bilbo's direct damage to staging are especially welcome to Hobbit decks -- and guarded cards also work best for turtle decks, which secrecy decks generally are.

The toymaker is overcosted by 1, there are a ton¬†of 2wp for 2 resources options out there. So if his discount is 1, you aren't getting a discount and need a second card in hand to even get your value¬†

Well I guess Secrecy Hobbit decks have one more amazing tool now at their disposal with The Shirefolk. Gaffer Gamgee is also amazing, providing attack cancellation and sinergizing quite well with Raise the Shire and Tom Cotton. Drinking Song is also a good event for both drawing and getting rid of cards in your hand that are not really useful at the moment. I guess I will try thinking about a good Hobbit deck right now.

If the Erebor Toymaker reduces the cost of the next attachment by 2 it could be an awesome card.

I cannot imagine any cards will interact with the trait. It's more flavor text than anything. Can you imagine any other character with that trait? I could be wrong of course but I'd bet big we will never see anything make use of that trait

Today he is the only character with that trait. It could be used by designers to trigger some effects limiting it's use to Bilbo and maybe few other characters in the future. ¬†

Guarded cards fetching effects? Not sure. As of today I agree it's just flavour text and nothing else

The only thing a Burglar does right now is to not increase Smaug's threat. Still I can imagine a card like Word of Command or The Seeing-stone for Burglars to fetch guarded cards from the deck. For instance:

Burglar's Sense: Tactics event, cost 1

Play only if you control a Burglar character. Action: Search your deck for a card with the guarded keyword and add it to your hand. Shuffle your deck.

Ever as he climbed the same white gleam had shone before him and drawn his feet towards it. - The Hobbit

Note there is no requirement to exhaust, as it has only a few targets in the deck.

There's quite a few 2-for-2, 6 unique characters in spirit and lore, but for non-unique characters there are three that are fire and forget and all are fragile -- Galadriel's Handmaiden, Ethir Swordsman, and West Road Traveler.¬† Then there's a few others with drawbacks -- Escort for Edoras (one-shot quester), Lindon Navigator (have to discard to keep after questing), Curious Brandybuck (goes away after exploring active location), and Wandering Ent (enters exhausted).¬† 3 cost for 2 willpower is more common for fire-and-forget questers, though a number of them have cooler abilities IMO.

One thing the Toymaker has that other 2-wp questers mostly don't have is the dwarf trait.¬† The only other 2-wp non-unique dwarfs are Dwarven Sellsword (ongoing cost) and Longbeard Elder.¬† In spirit there's only Bofur, so I can see the Toymaker being popular in a dwarven mining deck, especially if those become more attachment heavy in response to Thror's Ring.

I'd have to play with Bilbo to really assess his ability in full, but I am increasingly finding that the threat cost of heroes is less important as the game develops. Back in the old days sub-30 threat total was important, but now a 9 threat hero seems like no biggie (and perhaps it's just that T-Eowyn has thrown the curve so much with her ability, which is *so good*). I can definitely see the advantages in Bilbo. I really want to try out a direct damage deck in which all the heroes deal damage each round (Thalin, Bilbo and Argalad - am I forgetting some other options...?).

Good hobbit support here, and Sting looks very tempting for a guarded card.

The problem with Argalad is that he would reduce the enemies threat, and then Bilbo would have less willpower.¬† I'd agree I'd like to make the deck you describe, but those 2 particular heroes abilities¬†clash.¬† It could work anyway, just not consistently I think.¬†

Yeah, that's true. Although what you could do instead is to choose the order of activation so that you clear off enemies that are ready to be offed with Argalad, and choose your moments to activate him. I can't recall off the top of my head, but would Bilbo's willpower be reduced by Argalad's action is you activate Argalad after staging and before quest resolution?¬†

Actually, given the order of activation, Argalad need not affect Bilbo:

'A lasting effect created by a player card ability must be¬†calculated at the time that the ability is triggered, and that¬†effect is not recalculated if the game state changes.'

So activate Bilbo's response when he quests, then later activate Argalad for the same enemy. The fact that Argalad has reduced the willpower later does not affect Bilbo's response, since they are both player card abilities, and therefore not recalculated. Does this logic hold?

I was thinking the two abilities would counter each other.

Bilbo select an enemy and gets stat boost equal to enemy threat until and that phase. When argalad activate he reduce enemy threat. So even if triggering argalad after staging the reduction would apply to Bilbo boost.¬†

Unless I understood Bilbo wrong the response effect allow to choose the enemy while the stat boost is not fixed at that moment. It could goes up or down depending on enemy threat variations. ¬†If the enemy is discarded before¬†quest resolution I assume Bilbo stat boost will be 0

I'm leaning towards it being fixed at the time of response [courtesy of the lasting effect ruling], which means that Bilbo could get the boost even if Argalad not only reduces the enemy's threat, but if he actually kills the enemy in question.¬† But since that would work out well for the players, perhaps I'm optimistic on that point.

What about picking an immune enemy for the willpower boost?¬† It's clearly "choosing" an enemy, but it does not affect the enemy in any way.¬† Cards that boost based on being lower than engagement cost "interact" with a specific immune enemy, but work just fine -- why should it be OK to interact with the engagement cost but not OK to interact with the threat?¬† (The direct damage wouldn't work, of course.)

Hard to say, the FAQ clearly states "that player card effects cannot directly influence or interact with a card that is immune to player card effects." But it also says "you may still use Pippin's Response to draw a card, because this response is not affecting the enemy in any way."

And even though I see drawing a card due to engagement cost as interacting, it is allowed due to not affecting the enemy in any way and the same applies to Bilbo's response. So I would vote for allowed.

As far as modifying an enemy's threat goes (or even killing him), the FAQ writes: "A lasting effect created by a player card ability must be calculated at the time the ability is triggered, and that effect is not recalculated if the game state changes." So Bilbo gets a willpower boost as soon as he commits to the quest and keeps it to the end of the phase.

The question is whether it is "the target" when only Bilbo is affected.¬† Pippin's response *does* work when engaging an immune enemy with engagement > threat, after all, and that's not possible without interacting with the immune enemy's threat.

Does Robin Smallburrow's response work with immune locations?

FWIW I'm in general agreement with @dalestephenson [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/256741-dalestephenson/]'s interpretation here, that we have "read access" to encounter cards, regardless of Immune status. What's problematic for Tilbo is that he uses the word "choose", which, as has been pointed out, is specifically called out in the FAQ on Immunity.

I think Bilbo will be pretty much just a niche character: trap decks or something where a big enemy stays in the staging area? Even then, 9 threat really works against him.

Tactics seems like a bad sphere for the ability too: they have the tools to just kill stuff, not leave it and out quest it.

Not unplayable, but definitely lacking.

Bilbo is clearly an hero working differently from his sphere colleagues.

Which sometimes can be great, think of T-Eowyn or S-Beregond

Early to say as we did not have the time yet to try him in practice but i consider him quite good in hobbit deck as alternative to merry or Tom cotton to splash tactic to access to some key cards (dagger of westernesse , feint, handling determination, ¬†etc..).

And if he finally works with argalad then things can get really interesting... ¬†Bilbo and argalad strikes for 2. Add in a gondorian superman with a spear and you kill 1 4hitpoints enemy every round without needs to defend. Not considering Thalin, goblin cleaver or any other dire t damage effect.

Not a powerhouse but a fun hero not made for all decks .¬†

We have Open the Armory, so finding Sting in a Bilbo deck is going to be pretty easy.

I think people are going to be surprised at Bilbo's power, as it's clear that his ability was designed in part to make up for his high threat cost. Personally, I think he'll be incredibly fun and thematic to play, which is what I want out of the character. People that by default compare every questing hero to Eowyn are going to be frequently disappointed.

I would not say, Bilbo requires a high threat enemy to work. Essentially he negates the threat of one enemy and damages him in the process. Imagine a solo game with an enemy in the staging area, only Bilbo commits to the quest and a treachery is about to be revealed (one that does not increase threat in any way). If the enemy has 1 threat, Bilbo will have 2 willpower, quest succesfully, deal 1 damage and place 1 progress. If the enemy has 5 threat, Bilbo will have 6 willpower, quest succesfully, deal 1 damage and place 1 progress. If there is an empty staging area, Bilbo will have 1 willpower, quest succesfully and place 1 progress.

So in the end, it does not matter how much threat the enemy has, the result will be the same(save for the damage). It's more like a repeatable Radagast's Cunning without cost, but a damage component instead.

And why would Tactics be bad for him? Most direct damage cards are in this sphere anyway. And every enemy you can kill without a defender saves you actions, resources or cards.

Yeah, but it still requires an enemy to be in the staging area; 9 threat really works against the whole secrecy thing.

Bilbo + Folco is .... OK, but Merry or Pippin work better with more hobbit heroes in play so that feels like it is working against some of the more common heroes a¬† Bilbo deck might use.

There is some synergy with traps, but his ability just doesn't complement ranger spikes. the way I read it, the -2 threat from spikes cancels out any Bilbo gain.

He's in tactics, the sphere best suited to engaging and killing enemies.

Not only is he 9 threat for 6 stats, but 2 defense with 2 hp? pretty fragile for a defender - or even a quester in a lot of missions. Due to poor stat allocation, he's probably a bit more over-costed than adding up his stats might indicate.

His damage is done to the same enemy his threat is against, which means he is torn between killing something weak or canceling something high threat.

I don't see any real synergy with Sting - any version of it.

Not unplayable by any means, but it feels like a lot of missed opportunities.

If he was in the same sphere as "Hobbit Pony" and "Fastred", Bilbo would be better. If his stats were 2-1-1-2 for 8 cost AND spirit, he'd be something to be a bit excited about.

(He's not horrible by any means; he is comparable to Leadership-Eomer - who also feels like a hero who doesn't work as well as he should.)

There are enemies in this game with high engagment cost that you do not want to/cannot engage early or never at all. Something like a Goblin Sniper, Orc Vanguard, Cave Eel, Umbar Assassin, Carn D√ªm Garrison, Island Watcher etc. Trolls, Giants and Mum√¢ks tend to have too many hitpoints to kill them this way. You could also compare Bilbo to Thalin: The former provides potentially more willpower and damage over time, while the latter can deal more damage per round.

And let's be honest, while a hero like Beravor has a 10 statpoints, most likely they will not be used, as Beravor will draw cards. So this would also be 10 threat for effectively 4 hit points and some card draw.

Yeah, but if you take Fastred (or Damrod for traps), you don't have all-hobbit or (hobbit-ranger), which removes some of the stuff you can do - like Shirefolk. (I think Shirefolk is a great card: but does it work well with Bilbo + Dwarves or anything thematic?)

I wasn't advocating Bilbo in that deck -- but honestly, I've got to say Fastred/LeEomer/TaBilbo would be great fun.¬† Fastred pops an enemy back in staging, then the following questing phase Bilbo can steal its threat and ding it, while Eomer quests and kills it.¬† Plus Bilbo's the right sphere to play weapons and armor on Fastred and LeEomer.¬† Total awesomeness.

Shirefolk is only for all-Hobbit decks -- but the *existence* of Shirefolk means that *any* Hobbit deck has reasonable expectation of low threat, even if they're using either version of 9-threat Bilbo.¬† I don't think Bilbo had to be priced so high -- I'm just saying that even at nine threat, either version is going to be an asset in an all hobbit deck.

Sounds plausible to me.¬† I've done a lot of deck analysis for my Stereotypical deck series, and Beravor is usually the most picked utility hero in Lore -- that's not enough to actually be selected for a stereotypical deck, though, since thematic picks usually outnumber utility picks.

She's still fantastic, even more now that we have more readying options than ever. In a deck that can pump out allies like crazy with just a couple attachments, like Dale, drawing 2 extra cards per turn is more useful than the 3rd hero stats honestly.

I used that as well, though I hoped, there was a way in RingsDB to show rankings. At any rate, while Tactics √âowyn is ranked at #4 in HoB, she has less than 640 decks on RingsDB, compared to Beravor's 680. Though it is possible, that HoB only counts unique decks.

I was thinking this too, because spirit-Pippin has always been another hero that is a huge missed opportunity.

Thematically though, you want Bilbo to work with Dwarves and Gandalf.¬† If I want a thematic deck, I don't want Bilbo and Pippin, I want Bilbo-Gandalf-Thorin. It feels like there should be something there, and I am just not seeing it.

Beravor is still great and probably even better now than a couple of cycles ago.¬†

Her missed stat with contemporary allies are often not missed at all. I stopped playing ready effect on her since is often better pay the same cost for an ally of 2 willpower or attack. I don't think she is worth the unexpected courage you can play on your killer attacked or wall defender just for her 2 points of stat.¬†

But her ability still rocks and makes many decks far better. Some recent cards like duneadain pipe increase her value even more.¬†

If you need access to lore or repeatable card draw to make your deck better than I can't think of a better options.

There is a thematic deck that almost creates itself:

Bilbo - Gandalf - Thorin
Glamdring - Sting - Orcrist - Magic Ring
The dwarf allies

For our scenario, "Gandalf" is a captive in Dol-Guldur and Thorin recruits Bilbo to rescue him and following that they learn Golum was a prisoner too and head off in pursuit.

I think this is supposed to represent him in the Hobbit timeline though. I mean, it would make little sense to have a young Bilbo running around with Sam and Merry, but then¬†again you can have Thorin and Thorin III in the same deck, same as with the Bard's.

Thematically, Bilbo, Gandalf and Thorin didn't work together smoothly at all.¬† So if the deck reflects that, it's properly thematic!

I like that TaBilbo is especially good for SpPippin, not for thematic reasons (Pippin was very young when Bilbo left the shire), but because I love cards that make old little-used cards better.¬† It expands the effective card pool twice as fast.

Grimbeorn is certainly a stand-out, but Dain, Haldan and Bard are all really solid and open up new playstyles. I think the support for existing decks ( silvan, eagles ) has been good, and the addition of cards like the boots really help multiplayer play. Really been pleased with the new options; if anything, Grimbeorn is a bit too much power-creep (which reduces diversity in decks!)

It is one of the best fight hero for solo, but fight hero are still better in multiplayer.

There is no awesome interactions between Grimbeorn and others heroes, my personal lineup is TaAragorn Grimbeorn LeaDenethor , I have other tactics resource to spend, so I can keep Grimbeorn one for his ability, I play many attachments for boost Grimbeorn (and other characters) defense and attack. It work fine to me.

But the game changer cards of the cycle is Drinking Song. It enable so many strategies to be able to redraw your hand.

The current cycle has turned three different flavor attributes¬†into tribes -- Dale, Woodmen, and Beorning.¬† Only the first of those is really strong at this point, but three new tribes is really unprecedented.¬† The mechanics of each (ally attachments, location attachments, ally replacement) seem pretty fresh to me.¬† YMMV.

I am particularly pleased to see cards that strengthen past coasters.¬† TaBilbo's effect is roughly similar to Argalad (who didn't get a threat penalty), effectively mitigating enemy threat while possibly doing direct damage.¬† But as the first *hobbit* to have that effect, Bilbo makes Spirit Pippin better.¬† And of course, any new direct damage heroes has synergy with old direct damage heroes.¬† Ultimately everything in the game comes down to questing successfully, surviving and defeating enemies, and not threating out -- every card in the game is just variation on accomplishing those tasks.¬† But the more ways the game gives me to do those core tasks, the greater the effective diversity of the game is to me.¬† I think this cycle has done a good job of that.

Ah ah ah.

Not sure,¬†it could be LoreGlofindel. ¬†

I would love an partner hero making HIM more popular....

As for Spirit Pippin I'm not sure he will work so great with new Bilbo. I think Bilbo would partner well with any hobbit. Keep an enemy in staging and damage him with Bilbo. Engage a more manageable one and draw with lore pippin and defend with Sam or Tom in order to play an off sphere hobbit next round. Spirit merry is great too as he would grant access to¬†hobbit pony and reduce your threat. Frodo could be less fitting but not obscenely bad.

To be clear, I'm not saying that Spirit Pippin is necessarily the best hobbit to go with Tactics Bilbo, just as I'm not claiming that Dori is the best hero to go with Grimbeorn.¬† But the reverse is true -- *if* you play Spirit Pippin, he has synergy with Tactics Bilbo and no other hobbit.¬† Tactics Bilbo likes enemies in staging; Spirit Pippin's lone ability is to force enemies back to staging (for¬†a cost).¬† [Of course, if Pippin uses his ability just once, his threat cost is the same as TaBilbo!)

Lore Glorfindel's biggest problem is Spirit Glorfindel.¬† If Spirit Glorfindel didn't exist, LoGlorfindel + Light of Valinor + Asfaloth is well worth the threat cost.¬† He does have synergy with Elrond and self-damaging heroes, but those are all high cost.¬† Maybe what LoGlorfindel needs is a self-damaging hobbit....

## 115 [dalestephenson on December 7, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/287309-mount-gundabad/?do=findComment&comment=3560291)

What Fatty needs is a hobbit that either mitigates or benefits from player-inflected threat raises.¬† This would also help SpPippin and SpFrodo.¬† Maybe something like this:

Lobelia Sackville-Baggins

2 wp, 2 att, 0 def, 2 hp (6 threat)

Response: After your threat is raised by any player card effect, exhaust Lobelia to reduce your threat by the same amount.

I think it is more that his threat is too high for his ability, and the cost better suited to Leadership or Gondor. He has synergy with a Elrond and Treebeard, but you aren't going to run the three of them together outside of specific missions (Shadow and Flame?)¬†

Make him 9 cost: 3-2-1-3 stats - "discard a card from your hand to heal a point of damage."

Yeah. Lore glorfindel is probably the worst designed hero of the core set and difficult to bring back to regular play. His ability/sphere make him difficult to play. His cost/stats is totally fine. ¬†But we had from cycle two better alternatives for questing and attacking (Elrond plus light of valinor equals glorfindel in terms of Acton attack and elrond¬†abities are among the best in the game. Aragorn hit for 3 and had an ability totally game changing at the time of release). Basically with lore glorfindel you have a very good hero in terms of stats with high¬†cost equalling those stats and basically no ability which is a crime for an high cost hero.¬†Not enough considering all best alternatives around.

Fatty and Pippin need:

Hobbit Sense: 1 cost - spirit - after your threat is raised by a player card, discard Hobbit Ferocity to grant each Hobbit hero you control +1 attack, defense, willpower until the end of the phase. Reduce your threat by 1.

True, but I stand by my point -- if Spirit Glorfindel didn't exist but Asfaloth did, he'd still see a lot of play.¬† Even if his ability would be better with a discard instead of resource cost (absolutely true), Asfaloth is fantastic on Glorfindel and only on Glorfindel.¬† Glorfindel's high cost and stat distribution are absolutely a practical problem, but the existence of a low-cost alternative with an identical statline -- and the same ability to exploit Asfaloth, has neutered the poor fellow.¬† Elrond's a fantastic, widely used hero with not one but two useful abilities.¬† Make a cost-six spirit Elrond with identical stats and Spirit Glorfindel's drawback, and it would *seriously* cut into Lore Elrond's popularity.

Spirit Glorfindel aside, I agree that his stats are poorly distributed.¬† Paying for 5 hp is tough when he has no defensive chops, and without any built-in readying his high wp/attack values means you're paying for something you don't use.¬† Since 30 threat was a magic bad number in the first cycle, that really limited the decks he could go in -- and it didn't help that the *one* quest where Glorfindel's ability would be really useful, he couldn't use it.

Still, since SpGlorfindel exists, the question then becomes how to make LoGlorfindel *in his current form* be more popular.¬† What you need is a self-damaging resource generator with low threat in lore.

## 120 [Onidsen on December 7, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/287309-mount-gundabad/?do=findComment&comment=3560377)

@dalestephenson [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/256741-dalestephenson/], I'll give a little pushback there. Asfaloth is a worthwhile card even without Glorfindel. Much better on Glorfindel, of course, but totally worth playing even without.

I agree that lore Glorfindel is a much better hero than he's normally given credit for. What he needs to bring him into use could be something as¬†small as an attachment that keys off of spending a resource to activate an ability. Perhaps exhaust it to add a resource after you spend one on an ability. Works with Gildor and the twins, too.

At this point you're exhausting two heroes to mitigate one enemy's threat :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png].

Anyway, I think L Glorfindel is woefully underrated.

I think about 'how much would I pay for this ability if it was an attachment?' ...¬†

Like most abilities, LoGlorfindel's ability costs 0 threat.¬† His high threat has nothing to do with his ability, it's simply a function of his high stats.

With that said, Dunedain Remedy is the closest equivalent to his ability, and that costs zero (the first hit is free).¬† It also can be used more than once per round and it's available in a non-Lore sphere.¬† OTOH, it's restricted to healing heroes.¬† And it's a great card....

I think Lore Glorfindel's underrated not because of his ability (though having always available healing *really is* valuable), but because of how good he is with his toys.

So not to change the subject away from lore glorfindel, but any bold predictions for the last AP of this cycle? Pretty clear that it will be a Lore hero, but who/what trait? Guarded card predictions?

Since they already have redone two heroes this set (brand and bilbo), I think it will be a new one. My bold prediction is Radagast, one of course, many¬†people will be underwhelmed. Such high expectations for that hero, not going to be able to live up to the expectations. Though I wonder if they will keep istari neutral -- it's been that way so far.

As others have suggested, I think it's either anduril or wormsbane (though I think that might actually appear as an objective attachment).¬†

More dale allies. That's a bold one, I know.

## 127 [Onidsen on December 7, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/287309-mount-gundabad/?do=findComment&comment=3560581)

I'm still pretty sure that the last guarded attachment will be the mithril shirt.

My guess for what it does: 1 cost in spirit, guarded by a location only,¬†+1 defense, +1 hit point, exhaust to cancel a point of damage dealt to the attached hero.

What? People (myself included) have been predicting Radagast in this cycle for pretty much years at this point (even before we knew Ered Mithrin was coming, people were predicting a Rhovanion cycle with¬†Radagast). As for what sphere (or non-sphere) he will be in, while I would prefer for all Istari to be neutral, if they could make all 4 remaining Istari and wanted to put them in spheres, we would have exactly enough for 1 wizard in each sphere and Gandalf being neutral (makes sense for the grey wizard). I still prefer all neutral but I wouldn't mind a Lore Radagast at all.

We've only had one FFG-invented hero this cycle (Haldan), and unsurprisingly¬†have had no female heroes.¬† So I'll predict an FFG-invented female for the final hero.

Not that I wouldn't mind ending with Lobelia Sackville-Baggins....

Radagast would be awesome and the final artifact is OBVIOUSLY the "Star of Elendil"

Bold prediction: there will be a secret mission included with the last pack that involves time travel, the "Dunland Trap", returning the artifact back where it came so that Aragorn can find it during the sack of Isengard so the space time continuum doesn't collapse in on itself.

Ha! I love this. But, I was just reading this section in Unfinished Tales, and he finds it hidden inside Orthanc, along with some other relics of Isildur's that Saruman had stolen, after he becomes king. Which would still lead to the same result, I suppose. But this does make me wonder what other time-travel or logicially inconsistent scenarios we can create!

Indeed the Star of Elendil is a card I've been waiting for for a while now. A sort of Voice of Isengard remake cycle themed around searching for¬†all these numen√≥rean artifacts, jewels palantiri, along with an actual Saruman hero this time around would be literally the perfect cycle for me.

There are actually two Stars of Elendil, the original one was lost when Isildur died at the Gladden Fields and then a new one was made in Rivendell for Valandil.

The LCG is set between the happenings of the Hobbit and Bilbo's departure of the Shire with the exception of Saga expansions and some PoDs. I wonder when the Siege of Ann√∫minas is set.

Sting, Glamdring and Orcrist have been found by Thorin's company and they remained in the possession of Bilbo, Gandalf and Thorin. As Thorin died at the Battle of Five Armies, Orcrist was placed on his tomb, together with the Arkenstone. The Necklace of Girion was given to Bard the Bowman in exchange for the Arkenstone, who then gave it to Thranduil. The necklace and the stone were both guarded by Smaug. And Thr√≥r's Ring was taken from his son in the Dungeons of Dul Guldur by Sauron himself. So technically all of the Guarded artifacts are already in the possession of some heroes or Sauron.

So how on Middle-earth are we supposed to find Glamdring or Thr√≥r's Ring guarded by a lowly Goblin?

The Elendilmir and Radagast are also my guesses for the last pack. I did not foresee Bilbo, but Gwaihir instead.

I wonder if we will at some point meet a vampire similar to Thuringwethil. The Hobbit after all mentions "Soon actucal darkness was coming into a stormy sky; while still the great bats swirled about the heads and ears of elves and men, or fastened vampire-like on the strickened."

Gandalf staff does this (and more things)¬†and it is not guarded.

Burning brand does it better.

At this point it seems Caleb just decided to make the iconic artifacts of Middle Earth (minus the One Ring sadly) to just be playable in regular decks, despite timeline issues, and I can't agree more with it. So no, I don't think there's a contrived lore reason for us being able to have Orcrist or the Arkenstone.¬†The reason is that Orcrist is a classic, iconic Tolkien weapon and it just had to be in the game as a playable card. Honestly, I would aboslutely love a One Ring player card (be it guarded or otherwise).

We are pretty far beyond needing lore justifications for our cards at this point. As early as the 2nd cycle of the game, we had eagles flying around in Moria. Since it is a deck building game, if you want a deck which is lore correct, it is your privilege to be able to create one. That desire need not prevent other players from creating decks which are wildly divergent from the lore though. The way the game is engineered, you can do either one. It‚Äôs lovely.¬†

Gaffer is not that good, it require a threat really low to function, so it stay mainly for hobbit/secrecy deck and even don't function on any enemy. And more important: it don't work on enemies that will engage you because of your threat, almost only on enemies you choose to engage. So you will more often optionally engage but you can't rely on it for unexpected fight.

It stay a really solid card for low threat decks, whom I really do like. But it is way less powerful than the auto-include quickbeam or arwen.

I'd argue that he's a great ally. Two cost for one willpower and a Feint in Lore. Of course, the engagement cost requirement factors in.

I'll grant you that he's not a powerful as quickbeam or arwen, though! :lol: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_laugh.png]

I wanted to see a Hobbit cost reduction card come into the card pool, because a deck with Tom Cotton has incentive to bounce them in and out of play like Silvans.¬† But with Gaffer I'm pretty sure now that we will never see one.¬† He would be bonkers.¬† Even if your threat is like 38 mid-game, there will still be that 44 or 45 threat troll up there in staging, waiting to come down and swing for 7 attack.¬†¬†

You also have a powerful resource mechanic available for hobbit (in addition of steward I mean): resourceful. Secrecy and hobbit really should be seen at sub thematic (like dwarf swarm and dwarf mining are sub-thematic of dwarf): they really easily can be combined.

So I really intent to be able to cast Gaffer every turn and get access to a feint each turn. And we really can have powerful threat reduction in hobbit so ending at 38 would be rare. That will be great!

For your in-and-out hobbit you can already check for Curious Brandybuck. I play with optimized hobbit & secrecy fellowship with 3 on every deck and, since we have many draw we get to bring multiple of them in play every turn under any player control. That's really great!

My French is a bit rusty, but I'd translate it as follows:

Action: Count the number of cards in your hand and shuffle your hand into your deck. Then, draw an equal number of cards. Draw an additional card, if you control a unique Hobbit character.

It's a reference to the Arkham Horror LCG. The latest cycle for that game just wrapped up, and if you complete certain conditions along the way and recover some time-travelling artifact, you get to play a Super Secret Bonus Scenario, which is basically travelling back in time to undo the events of the 2nd scenario in the campaign.

Yes, exactly.

The Star of Elendil (one of them?) was found by Aragorn following the destruction of Isengard by the ents. So, at some point, Saruman must have acquired it. The Ringmaker cycle sort of hints at many of the events of the two towers: alliance with Dunland, creation of the white hand orcs, etc.

The Arkham reference was kind of a joke about setting the timeline straight after using an artifact when it shouldn't have been used.

It is probably better than that. In many deck you will play the best (or the top 2 may be) card of your hand and then recycle the rest to see essential cards. It give you the maximum chance to see your best cards on turn one, since you can even play another one. And it become really awesome when combine with other draw engine, so it basically ensure we no longer will fail our shot in combo decks.

I'm pretty sure that an optimal decklist for your hobbit deck will include 3 of each and still contain 50 cards. If you interested in my opinion in what you should remove I can give it to you (create a topic or give me ringsdb link for example). And playing 53 cards with 3 of each seem still better than 50 cards with only one of them.

Armor of Erebor has similar cost and benefit to Ring Mail, though in general I'd rather have an extra hp than sentinel -- though in combination with Hauberk of Mail the sentinel is worth an extra hp.¬† On dwarves I don't think it's a big difference, but the eligibility for attachment-loving Dale allies opens up more possibilities.¬† It's not limit 1, though getting sentinel twice has no value.

Greenwood Defender's ability to defend without exhausting would be fantastic with better defense, but even with Celeborn's boost there's a limit to how many defenses can be handled with 3/3.¬† At 3-cost he's difficult to flit in and out of play, but with a defensive attachment could be good.¬† With zero willpower and zero attack, he has no backup utility.

Elf Guide generates a resource when pulling a Silvan out of play.¬† Not sure it's a big enough effect to get it in Silvan decks, though it does let Galion generate a resource for free.

I think Drinking Song will be the most widely used card in the deck, though I expect to see Shirefolk in all hobbit hero decks.

The really cool thing I have just realized yesterday by reading Erebor Toymaker is that, by its wording, the attachment discount is not limited to the player who played it. In a 4 player fellowship, going by turn order, if the first player (let's call it Player A) plays the Toymaker he can enjoy the discount but if it does not play any attachment it will be the first amongst Players B, C and D who plays an attachment to enjoy the discount. Quite versatile for multiplayer.

Now we have two spirit events that return Silvans to your hand, and two Leadership events that do the same.

Only one Lore and one Tactics event.¬† Seems like we might get a whole suite of 2nd Silvan-returning events per sphere.¬† Lore would likely be healing in some form, if you consider the Tree People's ally swap to be a form of card draw.¬† The existing Tactics event deals direct damage, so we might expect a second one to add or subtract attack or defense value from characters or enemies.

Only one pack remaining in the cycle. If we do get the extra 2 Silvan events, they either both show up in the final pack, or we get another cycle.¬† Woo!¬† (people have been saying Thorin and Gildor are confirmation of another cycle, but I could still see them being released together in a non-collector's edition of the 2-player starter kit).

## 176 [lleimmoen on February 6, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/287309-mount-gundabad/?do=findComment&comment=3614909)

At the first glance Elf Guide is exactly the card I always wanted in my Silvan decks. I have been often choosing between the few Leadership 0 cost rescource accelerators, but this one seems to do it best, returning the Silvan as you like it. Choosing any hero, not only yours, is a great bonus, too.

And how much better is Greenwood Defender than Denfender of the Naith, especially with Thranduil.

This it it. Greenwood defender is a better replacement of defender of Naith in a good number of cases. Then if any of the two will make the deck cut is greatly depending on deckbuilding¬†¬†and quests. Not auto include in Silvan deck but a solid option to consider where multiple defense is needed.

The event is ok and a worth addition to the archetype.¬† Again not necessarlily an auto include but a good option to have.¬†

With elvenking release,¬† Silvan event become less mandatory for the archetype freeing a lot of space in deck for different choices. I think no Silvan event now is by definition an auto include while all remains good options to choose from. Which is only good.

## 178 [lleimmoen on February 6, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/287309-mount-gundabad/?do=findComment&comment=3614925)

Yes, it is already hard to make the cut for many of the allies. I have been playing the deck since I first seen the cards spoiled (long before they came out) and basically never stopped. And came to the magic number of 26 Silvan allies that has¬†not changed recently.

Anyway, do you think, we shall see the second Silvan event¬†also for Lore and Tactics? There is only¬†one pack left in this cycle...

¬†

PS. I only run a single copy of the Elven-king and I prefer the events mostly. Partly because neither Celeborn nor Thranduil are neccessarily oft needed for double duty, and the events are powerful in their primary effects and possible to fetch with the Minstrel.

The main advantage of the Elven King for me is to continue playing allies and get their effects when you run out of your events. And Thranduil could defend twice in a round, which is always useful.

## 180 [Halberto on February 6, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/287309-mount-gundabad/?do=findComment&comment=3615142)

Yes, the power of elvenking isprimarily in being a¬†¬†repeatable effect able to return constanlty allies to hand and secondly in the reading effect itself. Both celeborn and thranduil has stats making worth readying even if not outstanding when not buffed and often it won't be the case.

¬†Silvan¬† is¬†now an archetype¬† down to choices: few silvan event and more attachemt or more silvan event and less attachment? Galadriel or not? If¬† yes with many toys or none? with many blue cards (light of valinor for celeborn +¬† mirkwood knife) and resource acceleration ( steward?, new silvan event? Captain Winston on Galadriel?).¬†

How many combat allies from tactic? How many green utility allies?¬†

Sneak attack and Gandalf or not space enough?

Very good tale for long term board state improvement or no?

So many valid choices...¬†

Tonight with my girlfriend we played back to back The Ghost of Framsburg and Mount Gundabad, winning them both once. We found much harder The Ghost of Framsburg (it took us three tries to win, while one was enough for Mount Gundabad), probably because our decks can't handle very well lots of threat increases (and also because there are quite a few effects in The Ghost of Framsburg which block readying effects, around which we build a lot) and are instead very well versed in handling brutal combats so Mount Gundabad was easier for us. Playing Mount Gundabad we ammitedly had some luck with the quest order at the beginning (less so afterwards) and we were able to finish it in the combat phase of the 6th turn.

In any case they are both very thematic and interesting quest, especially Mount Gundabad that really sold the whole "wandering in the ruins with a dragon roaming around" feel. Totally approved.

## 189 [GrandSpleen on February 23, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/287309-mount-gundabad/?do=findComment&comment=3632044)

Main problem with Lore Glorfindel's ability is the limit, in my opinion.¬† You have ways to deckbuild and get around the cost (I don't think it matters that the ways to get those resources are mostly non-Lore cards; a card doesn't need to exist in a mono-sphere vacuum in order to be "good").¬† Having healing right from the start of the game can be a big deal in some scenarios¬†or decks.¬† With a higher limit, he could be the *only* healing card in your deck (as long as you don't really need to heal allies).¬† As he is, he certainly cannot pull that weight. So if you think you need healing and include Glorfindel, you're going to be including Glorfindel *and* some other healing cards on top of that. This shifts his role in a deck. His ability doesn't provide the cornerstone which makes your deck work, he ends up providing 'insurance' basically.¬†¬†

I've thought some about cards which would revitalize lore Glorfindel specifically, but have come up blank.¬† Any idea I has would end up being overpowered by the existence of other cards.¬† Ideas revolve around 1) providing some benefit when you pay a resource to activate a hero card's Action ability, or 2) providing some benefit when healing a card.¬† Either would make other existing cards too powerful.¬† I guess you could make it super restricted or even make it "Attach to Glorfindel," but I tend to dislike cards that belong to 1 and only 1 character.

Instead of a new card, Lorefindel just needs a higher limit for his action, as you said. Even D√∫nedain Remedy can heal for more, and it is not even from the Lore sphere.

There are several cases where the devs have errataed a card to make it better, but I think¬†in no case was the card printed as originally designed and then errata-ed for the purpose of making it more playable.¬† Arkenstone was clearly a misprint, and I suspect Ravens of the Mountain was probably a misprint.¬† Out of the Wild received positive errata (adding the card to the victory display makes it better for a victory display deck, which is the primary use of the card), but it seems obvious to me that it was done to prevent its use in a degenerate case.

It's not a player card, but the changes to Troll Purse and Troll Key make it easier to get the treasures from the first Hobbit quest; I don't know if those were misprinted originally or they did just change them to make it easier on the player.

I wish the devs *would* errata player cards to make them more playable, though I appreciate them inventing new cards that synergize with old bad cards.

Sometimes the process and repercussion of errata are more trouble than having a few less playable cards. Yes those cards are less powerful, but that has no effect on the game's overall health. I think the developers might want to limit the amount of errata given since players then have cards that say and actually do different things. Just my two cents as to why we haven't gotten positive player card errata.

I believe they never managed the promised ‚Äòonce a month‚Äô release of the adventure packs, not even in 2011. And I knew the previous cycle was especially slow, but I had a (probably misleading) feeling that this cycle things got a bit quicker again.

Anyway, knowing it is now already at least a month since somebody got his hands on Mount Gundabad and it is still not officially released yet, perhaps we can at least see the spoilers before we actually get the pack... I usually do two or three weeks after the official release, earliest.

Here's the date of the "Now available" articles for the current cycle:

16 Aug 2018 Withered Heath

18 Oct 2018 Roam Across Rhovanion

13 Dec 2018 Fire in the Night

7 Feb 2019 The Ghost of Framsburg

The last two were not dedicated articles, but in a "FFG products available now" article, so the actual release may have been slightly earlier.¬† So it's approximately two months, but the longest gap (2 months 2 days) is between the first two, and Framsburg/Gundabad looks likely to be the shortest gap.¬† I think there's a good chance of getting the final pack by the end of May.

Of course, it doesn't compare to getting it two months early in Italy...¬†üôÑ

I will let you guys know if I will get similarly lucky with The Fate of Wilderland :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

This quest seems pretty hard. Tried it with a pair of tactics/noldor decks that have done well against the rest of the cycle. I was holding my own for quite a while, and I got 19 points of damage on Dagnir, but the actual win condition is really hard to reach.¬†

Eventually, some nasty treacheries wiped out my allies, and I started losing heroes before I could rebuild. It was all downhill from there.
