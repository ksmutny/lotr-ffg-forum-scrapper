So i have a couple of questions regarding the upcoming BR expansion:

 

Lets say you have Sam (8), Merry (6), and Pippin (6) that makes 20 threat,

 

1. Imagine sam dies and you replace it with Glorfindel (5) so now your threat would be 18 (17 normal +1 because of the penalty). Now lets say i swich Merry for Aragorn (12), What would be the new threat:

 

a.) 24 (23 of normal threat +1 for changing to Aragor)

 

b.) 25 (23 of normal threat +1 for changing and +1 for adding Glorfindel for the death of Sam)

 

If it is option b this could mean that if you change heroes constantly the +1 threat would stack up?

 

2. What happens if you change a hero for one with the same name, for example changing lore pippin for spirit pippin, would this add +1 threat or since the hero has the same name it doesn´t receive the penalty?

I think the same hero is the same hero regarding the sphere. You dont need to rise your threat tis time.  

I see like you have a pile of the dead hero and you must add to your starting threat + number of heroes in your dead pile.

+ 1 if you just a change a hero. So is quite easy actually.

I do it now with my own compaign through all Hobbits quests using  cards include a heroes only from the Core set and both Hobbits expansion. I lost Beorn on the first quest so my starting threat is up to 1.

Thanks for the reply Glaurung, i think this will be a very good expansion. By the way if you are playing solo in your hobbit campaign try using thorin, ori and oin it´s quite powerful and i have beaten the 6 quests with the same heroes and without loosing any of them (although i did use cards from other expansions).

Has anyone received formal confirmation on how this works?  Both interpretations make sense.  Strict reading of rule book it seems you wouldn't have to raise your threat but I've learned that strict reading often ends up being wrong...

The Road Darkens instruction manual says that you don't have to take the threat increase if you switch a hero for one with the same name.

Thank you!  I was reading the Black Riders rule book and it doesn't disambiguate like the one from The Road Darkens.  For others here is the direct quote from The Road Darkens:

 

> Q: In Campaign Mode, if I used one version of a hero in a previous scenario and I wish to use a different version of that hero for next scenario, do I incur a +1 threat penalty?
>  
> A: No. As long as the new hero shares the same title as the previous hero, there is no penalty.
