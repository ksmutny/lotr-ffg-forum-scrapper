Is there a feature on the site to subscribe to a living card game and get teh new packs mailed out as they are produced?

That's a good idea but as far as I know, there is no program like that in place. I have a standing pre-order on anything Warhammer Invasion with my LGS. That's about the next best thing I suppose. Now that I think about it, I prefer this. Once the packs hit the stores, spoilers go up and then I have to have it now. I don't want to have to wait for FFG to ship it to me. Plus, if nothing else, it gives me a chance to drag the GF to the "Pokemon Store" once a month.

Go to your local store and subscribe there. That is what I did. He brings me in one of every pack for AGoT and LotR.

Likewise, although being in the UK, some chapter packs mysteriously never make it over here... For the most part th FLGS is the way to go- supporting the industry and saving yourself all the ordering hassle.
