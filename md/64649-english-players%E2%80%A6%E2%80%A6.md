I got mine here: http://www.gameslore.com/ [http://www.gameslore.com/]

I have always found them to deliver quickly and reliably in the UK.

Well I have ordered it from GamesLore now on your advice, hope they are quicker than Mealstrom!

 

 Out of interest how do you pre-order with GamesLore? I couldnt see it on the products that are not out yet!!
