# [Full Dunland Trap spoilers!](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/109099-full-dunland-trap-spoilers/)

## 1 [Estel Edain on June 21, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/109099-full-dunland-trap-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=1128259)

After a four month wait, new player cards are here! Except for Firefoot (recently spoiled at http://couplevscardboard.com [http://couplevscardboard.com]), the already spoiled cards can be found at http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=4592. [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=4592.]

 

Celeborn (spoiled)

 

Leadership

Naith Guide (spoiled)

 

Swift and Silent - Event, cost 1; Action: Ready a hero you control. Then, if your threat is 20 or less and this is the first time you played a copy of Swift and Silent this round, return this card to your hand instead of discarding it.

 

Tactics

Firefoot (spoiled)

 

Close Call (spoiled)

 

Spirit

Blue Mountain Trader - Ally, cost 2, 1w 0a 1d 2hp; Dwarf. Action: Choose another player. That player gains control of Blue Mountain Trader. Then, that player moves 1 resource from the resource pool of a hero he controls to the resource pool of a hero you control, or Blue Mountain Trader is discarded.

 

The Fall of Gil-galad - Attachment, cost 1; Song. Limit 1 per deck. Attach to a hero. Response: When attached hero is destroyed, add The Fall of Gil-galad to the victory display to reduce you threat by X, where X is the attached hero's threat cost. Victory 1.

 

Lore

Ithilien Lookout - Ally, cost 3, 1w 2a 0d 2hp; Gondor. Ranger. Secrecy 2. Response: After Ithilien Lookout enters play, look at the top card of the encounter deck. If it is an enemy, you may discard it.

The Tree People (spoiled)

 

Neutral

The White Council - Event, cost X; X is the number of players in the game. Action: Starting with the first player, each player chooses 1 different option: ready a hero he controls, add 1 resource to the resource pool of a hero he controls, draw 1 card, or shuffle 1 card from his discard pile into his deck.

 

Secrecy makes a comeback, and we have our second player card (not counting Treasures) with Victory points. The Fall of Gil-galad combines nicely with Rivendell Minstrel and with either Landroval or Fortune and Fate. 

 

Ithilien Lookout is very good with the secrecy discount, and acceptable without it. Like Miruvor, Swift and Silent can consistently ready different heroes (while your threat is 20 or less). It doesn't have the flexibility of Miruvor, but it also doesn't block your card draw like reusing Miruvor does. It will combo nicely with Leaf Brooch when The Three Trials comes out.

 

It might be surprising to see more support for dwarves, but Blue Mountain Trader is a nice addition that isn't overpowered. It's reminiscent of Wandering Took and Rider of the Mark. Outside of a dwarf deck it might be useful for moving resources, and it's only the second non-unique Spirit dwarf.

 

I'm not sure how good The White Council will be. None of its effects are especially powerful, but it provides versatility and, since it's neutral, it might compensate for a sphere's weaknesses.

Thanks, i agree with your points, i especially like the fall of gil galad and ithilien lookout

Fail of Gil-Galad looks really strange for me now……..who want to do that??? But actually in Caldara deck yes maybe…...

From the newly spoiled cards, White Council seems by far and wide the best to me. So versatile and useful in many a deck, and obviously in coop. I can already see running this card with via Vilya.

Ithilien Lookout is good, I would say he is better generally better than Ithilien Archer without the secrecy discount, but I generally dislike to play secrecy cards in a non-secrecy deck and I run no secrecy decks now. The new secrecy cards, except the ranger, are not intriguing enough to build a new deck around them, for me.

## 5 [HeavyKaragh on June 21, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/109099-full-dunland-trap-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=1128358)

I think The Fall of Gil-Galad, can't be used with Caldara's action: destroyed not equal to discarded. What do you think?

## 6 [PsychoRocka on June 21, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/109099-full-dunland-trap-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=1128364)

Fall of Gil galad might be good on Loragorn or Elrond in two player/two handed play for harder quests. Near the end if they block an attack that ends up killing them at least you get a threat reduction of 13/12! (Make sure you use loragorns threat reset first!) I usually use them as defenders anyway and in the games I play where they do die I might stand more of a chance to still win with a threat reduction of 12/13 allowing the other deck to deal with most enemies etc.

White council whilst still pretty good, is nowhere near as good as I thought it would be. Was really hoping it would do some minor healing or remove a condition attachment. Drawing a card is good but the shuffle a card from your discard pile into deck is useless for my play style.

Ithilien lookout seems pretty cool and possibly better than ithilien archer but lacks ranged which is awesome in two player/two handed. Might try him out and see how good his extra effect really is. Secrecy seems wasted on him though.

Thanks so much for the spoilers! Don't think I'll get dunland trap too soon due to living in Australia so really appreciate it =)

Yeah, it couldn't. It is limited to 1 per deck, so I think I'll include it into my spirit deck, as there is high chances of someone dying in a 4 player game.

Spirit lacks dwarves. I'm glad it's being fixed. Ranger is good for both secrecy and non-secrecy alike, decent enough.

## 11 [Nickpes on June 21, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/109099-full-dunland-trap-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=1128408)

Fall of Gil Galad can be used with a lot of high threat heroes, and then with Landroval or the spirit Fortune or Fate card bring back the hero.

## 12 [Pharmboys2013 on June 21, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/109099-full-dunland-trap-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=1128446)

Fall of Gil-Galad is certainly going to be a card that generates a lot of discussion. By name alone I hope it features some truly epic art. I'm sure some people will try to build around it and make it work but for the most part I can't see it being anything more than a token addition. The fact that it's an attachment and not an event really makes it more difficult to use because now you either need to have a pretty good idea of which of your heroes is most likely to die first or play it on someone with the intention of sacrificing them off. Plus with only one copy in the deck it might not always be in your hand at the ideal time. Very interesting card still, also interesting how they're developing spirit to include this theme of death and resurrection now.

The dwarf trader is a nice unique addition the ability may be useful but I think he'll mostly get seen in dwarf decks featuring spirit since it was already pointed out they lacked non-unique dwarf allies.

Ithilien lookout is certainly the card I'm looking forward to the most (among the cards that weren't already spoiled that is). I'm really pleased that this is arguably the first "secrecy" card that can still be used reliably and efficiently in non-secrecy decks. That ability is really great and obviously combines with a lot of other lore cards to make sure you take out an enemy. If you are using secrecy a phenomenal combo will be with risk some light (which I think is an underrated card to begin with) for what I think would be a secrecy cost of 1 you could look at top 3, put worst card at the bottom then kill off the worst enemy among the cards before it appears. The lookout obviously draws comparisons to ithilien archer but as a primarily solo player the lookout is a more ideal choice for me that can always be changed if I play with more people. It's nice to have choices even among the archetypes

## 13 [ana4 on June 21, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/109099-full-dunland-trap-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=1128450)

Shuffling a card back into a deck is a feature I am valuing more and more. The deck-shuffle alone is very useful for a variety of decks -- Stargazer, mono-sphere attachments, etc.

## 14 [MyNeighbourTrololo on June 21, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/109099-full-dunland-trap-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=1128467)

I don't think there is a point to build around gil-galad. You just put it there, and use it if it pops up and fits.

## 15 [Bullroarer Took on June 21, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/109099-full-dunland-trap-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=1128469)

It's a shame it can't be used with Boromir's 2nd ability.

## 16 [Narsil0420 on June 21, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/109099-full-dunland-trap-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=1128474)

I was expecting that we would get more Silvan cards in this pack so a little disappointed but they really are living up to "a smattering of cards for many different deck types." That's probably wiser in the long run since not everyone is as excited as I am about Silvan cards, I'm sure.

 

I think the Dwarf is very cool because it allows a spirit player to get a little bit of money which they're not great at and I think it's a great ability to be able to share an ally. I would do it more except the Wandering Took's ability never seems to work (it's not usually the spirit player that needs their threat lowered!)

 

Now I'm getting excited to revisit Secrecy but it might be best to wait for Leaf Brooch. Hmm... I wonder if a Celeborn/Mirlonde Silvan Secrecy deck would work... Or Elrond/Mirlonde...

 

Mainly this pack makes me excited for things to come as we seem to just have tastes of things here. At least we don't have another 4 month wait ahead of us! One month will seem like a snap!

Ha I agree, the wait for the three trials will feel like an instant. Will likely hold off until then to build a secrecy deck so swift and silent will have to get comfortable in my binder for just a bit

## 18 [Narsil0420 on June 21, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/109099-full-dunland-trap-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=1128598)

Which Encounter sets does it use? Other basics of the scenario?

Obviously. It's a dunland trap, so prepare to meet some old dunland friendsies.

Urg - did we really need to see secrecy resurrected ? Will the person who asked for this please stand up....oh no-one ?

Still I'm excited for the elves, although we need a few more packs before they really get going.

I stand up for more secrecy love, and I think am not the only one.

 

Aside from player cards, is there some info about the quest?

I haven't yet played the scenario, but it's listed as difficulty 7 and it uses the Dunlending Warriors and Weary Travelers encounter sets. Since there are no locations in those encounter sets, The Dunland Trap has several locations, and they interact with card draw. A unique (mini-boss) enemy and a unique location are set aside at the beginning of the quest, time counters remain important, and there's a 20 engagement cost enemy to make life interesting for low threat decks.

## 23 [MyNeighbourTrololo on June 21, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/109099-full-dunland-trap-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=1128670)

I stand up for developing anything underdeveloped and left in shadow, secrecy included.

The idea of Secrecy has intrigued me a lot but definitely needed more fleshing out. I'm excited to see a bunch more secrecy cards. If they continue to be cheap and help with action advantage, then 2-hero secrecy decks will become more viable. Fall of Gil Galad + Fortunate or Fate can be useful when you only have 2 heroes and need to keep your threat low.

Lore secrecy. No hidden meanings. First secrecy card that is decent outside of secrecy, as I had pointed out earlier. Totally gonna use dat in my 4 player lore deck. With Boromir, the Lookout will be 2/3/0/2. 

## 32 [Gizlivadi on June 22, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/109099-full-dunland-trap-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=1128749)

Btw, the Ithilien lookout has incredibly good art. I love the colors.

 

But I must say the art of the Fall of Gil-Galad is a big disappointment... I was, strangely enough, gladly expecting a Magali, a very epic art of the battle itself or something like that. And we got just a stylized picture on a wall. Quite meh IMO, even though the picture itself alone is not bad, but definately not deserving of being on that card.

Yeah, I'm thinking about it. Mirlonde and Faramir? add Pippin and try to get down to secrecy with Spirit cards (Fall of Gil-Galad?) and Rivendell Minstrel/Song of Travel?

For a starting threat of 22? I'm thinking more about Lore Aragorn and Glorfindel. bam. add of course 3 resourceful, master of the forge, etc. Maybe even a few songs, but if you already have 1 resourceful on both heroes, that's 2 resources per turn of that hero's sphere, which is better that all 2-sphere lineups, since there would be one hero who would get 1 less resource. You could use Faramir i guess as well, and maybe the deck would have a enemy in the staging area strategy with Noiseless Movements, Advance Warning, etc. And of course traps and rangers. Could work, but it would need adding Tactics for Great Yew Bow... 

 

Edit: ****, I just rememeberd I couldn't use advance warning... that card sucks.

Yeah, I often get stuck really wanting to make thematic things work (like Faramir). That and I am really sick of Glorfindel even though he's made for secrecy...

Can't wait to smash some Dunland face! Looks like you can't kill Chief Turch till the last quest stage or something, he reads "cannot leave play". Removing a time counter every time an enemy engages seems pretty **** nasty too, especially when combined with cards like In Need of Rest from weary travelers!

Denethor, Pippin, Mirlonde is 19 and you can help yourself with Needful to Know. Unless you are going to sing Spirit, you are not going to keep it secret for long, but the opening round or two can give you some advantage. Risk Some Light, Ithilien Lookout are great opening cards for that deck.

I don't want to spoil too much about the quest. I'll say this much: stage 1 requires many progress tokens, but has a fairly nasty Time 2 forced effect, so that will probably trigger a few times. Stage 2 is brief, as was spoiled in the preview, and it sets the stage for a challenging battle in stage 3, the final stage. The quest cards are more significant than the encounter cards in giving this scenario its unique flavour and challenge.

 

I'll spoil one more encounter card, but unfortunately I don't have a camera immediately available.

 

Hithaeglir Foothills - X threat, 4 quest points; Enedwaith. Hills. Surge. X is the number of resource tokens on this card. Forced: After a player draws any number of cards, place 1 resource token here.

Does a Blue Mountain Trader + Harbor Master [http://www.hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Harbor-Master-TDF] combo mean infinite defence in a multiplayer game?

Nope. Moving a resource does not triggers his ability. Only adding.

Fair enough. I assumed you could break down the act of moving a resource into removing it from one hero and adding it to another.

Yeah, I can't help but repeat that sentiment. This is the card I am looking forward most (next to the Silvan love).

By the way, could anyone link us to the full image of The White Council? (Not the partial spoiler.)

I've been using this setup for mono lore secrecy with some success. The key card is Resourceful, for overcoming lore's resource lack. This plus the strong draw form the basis for playing a bunch of allies. Elf stone can put in some of the more expensive ones. Secrecy is not maintained for long, but if you can get in one resourceful, that's usually enough. A timely elf-stoned Gandalf helps. Ithilien lookout will fit this deck perfectly (once I get it).

Yes, Blue Mountain Trader does create an infinite defense loop combo with Harbor Master. Good catch. Moving resources adds resources to another hero, as officially ruled by Caleb. Thus, you could just toss it back and forth forever until his defense is infinite...

We asked Caleb about this for our Progression Series review - it does not work.

Ithilien Lookout has an awesome effect, but I'm not sure I'm going to use it in my secrecy decks. Non-secrecy Lore decks? Absolutely. But with the amount of resource acceleration and free allies that a strong secrecy build brings, I'm not sure what I'd swap out to have space for them. Dunedain Wanderer, maybe, but the 2 defense is a big deal in a lot of quests.

Dúnedain Wanderer is very weak compared to Ithilien Lookout. I mean, they are just about equal not considering the cost - which is 2 less without and 1 less with the discount in favour of the Southern Ranger.

Yea, but Dunedain Wanderer has 2 more stat points, both in defense, which as chrsjxn pointed out, can be extremely useful. He should cost 1 more resource than Ithilien Lookout when comparing stats. And if you're playing multiplayer, then his Sentinel and Ranged can be very handy.

I just generally happy to see allies that support secrecy. And of all the deck archetypes, the ranger decks make the most sense as secrecy decks. The stats on both are pretty epic for their cost once secrecy is factored in. Overall, with these gradual additions, it looks like secrecy will become very viable soon. Not least because secrecy cost reduced allies chain into A Very Good Tale very nicely.

An Extremely Good Tale:

Exhaust all allies you control to shuffle your deck and discard top X cards, where X is the number of allies you exhausted, up to 10. Put all allies discarded by this effect into play under your control.
