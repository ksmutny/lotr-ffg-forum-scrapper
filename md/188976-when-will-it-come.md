Just started LOTR LCG and I'm captivated by it! I love this game and want to buy every expansion and play them all but there's one problem....Im a Completionist! I can't see buying another expansion until i get the Shadows of mirkwood cycle, and seeing as how Hunt for Gollum is unavailable (Except for $40 on Amazon-OUTRAGEOUS!), looks like I'm stuck with the core set for a while unless i go out of order. 

 

So 2 questions?

 

When will the Shadows of mirkwood cycle be available?

 

Can i buy a different expansion pack without losing story value by going out of order?

Did some looking around. This website: http://www.gameonestore.com/product-p/lotrhuntgollum01.htm [http://www.gameonestore.com/product-p/lotrhuntgollum01.htm]doesn't seem to indicate that it's out of stock.

 

FFG's upcoming page: https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/upcoming/ [https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/upcoming/]shows that the Mirkwood cycle is at the printers. So the reprint of this cycle is coming soon.

Question 1:

 

FFG has a product manufacturing status page that is very helpful:

 

https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/upcoming/ [https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/upcoming/]

 

You can filter the page by product type, such as Living Card Games.

 

The last update for the Shadows Over Mirkwood cycle was on July 23 of this year and was listed as "At the Printer". Hopefully its actually "On the Boat" at this time, since that update is rather old. Check your various FLGS and comic books stores to see if they might have some Shadows APs lying around. They just might. Also, Barnes and Noble has a pretty solid board/game game inventory, including X-Wing, by FFG. It's possible they might carry LOTR.

 

Question 2:

 

The Shadows Over Mirkwood and Dwarrowdelf cycles both had fairly loose storylines, so you wouldn't lose all that much by playing APs in those cycles out of order. The developers started implementing a more defined storyline in the APs beginning with the Heirs of Numenor cycle.

 

On a related note - the Saga boxes, which cover The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings Trilogy (we have boxes through the Two Towers at this time) obviously have storylines that closely follow those books, so you'd certainly want to play those in order if story consistency matters to you. The Lord of the Rings Saga boxes, in particular, are quite good and community members usually highly recommend them. If you are a completionist, the Hobbit boxes are also worthwhile, though not quite as highly recommended as the Lord of the Rings boxes.

For anyone based in europe here is a link to a dutch tolkien store who has makes it his sport to sell ALL things tolkien.

 

Which means he also has all the older LotR LCG packs in stock, even PoDs.

 

He has a awsome store, but does alot of his selling online now a days.

 

The site is in dutch, but you'll be able to figure out the shopping cart thing.

As noted above, the storyline is looser in the first two cycles so you wouldn't lose as much by going out of order. And furthermore, story doesn't really carry over between cycles. So if you skipped Shadows of Mirkwood and went straight to Khazad-Dum and the Dwarrowdelf cycle, you wouldn't lose anything story-wise at all.

Thanks for the link Noccus. I've had a hard time getting the Conflict at the Carrock AP. Are the products sold in English?

As noted above, saga expansions are out of the main order, so you could get a couple to bridge the gap until the reprints arrive :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Yay for completionist :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
