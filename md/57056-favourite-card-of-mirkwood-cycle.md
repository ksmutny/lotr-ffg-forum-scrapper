Place your votes....can be usefullness, thematic greatness, looks (im looking at you west road traveller babeo.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/babeo.gif]), whatever reason you want

 

mine is song of travel, that picture of the view outside a hobbit hole just captures the imagination of tolkiens world perfectly

Boy, it's really tough to pick just one. There are so many powerful, thematic cards that also happen to have outstanding art.

If forced, though, I'd probably go with Gildor Inglorion. Awesome stats, intriguing ability, and fantastic art. Anything by Magali Villeneuve is top notch, but this particular piece is especially impressive. 

Honorable Mentions: Support of the Eagles, Ride to Ruin, Prince Imrahil

Richsabre! That is also my favorite card simply due to the art! I have to play it in all of my decks because I love the art soooooooooooooo much.

Prince Imrahil followed closely by Elfhelm for player cards.   The four named Trolls from Conflict at the Carrock for encounter cards.

 Longbeard Map-Maker!  I can't wait for the lore dwarf leader in Khazad-dum to team up with Dwalin for some serious map-maker questing!

Favorite card for multiplayer: Gildor's Counsel

Favorite card for soloplayer: Bilbo Baggins

Favorite card all around: Ancient Mathom

I have a soft spot for the Winged Guardian. Maybe because I like eagles and he was the first one. And also because he is a real tough defender, which there aren't too many of. 

Prince Imrahil is also a favorite, as far as powerful cards. And if we are talking about pretty girls, West Road Traveller might be nice, but I'm far more partial to Dunedain Watcher. Darker, more dangerous, there's just something about her.

On that note does no one else think WRT looks like Kaley Cuoco?

I think mine is Radagast.  I like him a lot.  It was one of the few previewed cards that I was counting down the days to get.

I am surprised Gandalf wasn't mentioned as he has long been a game winner and with plenty of 'repeat' cards. (Not 'Stand and Fight")  However, I will vote for 'Unexpected Courage' for its usefulness and theme.  No wonder only 1 was put in the Core set.  My budget wont let me buy extra sets, so it is a joy to get this 1 gem into play.  There are a lot of nice cards for returning Attachments now, just in case you lose it.  Cheers!

OP specified Mirkwood cycle which folks interpreted as excluding the core set.  If you add the core set in, my favorite is Steward of Gondor.

Haldir.  A Great character, fantastically realized art, and an incredibly versatile set of stats.  Plus, the push on cards with elven keywords means he keeps getting better.

Boromir.  Great art, Good card, Best Mirkwood hero.

Favorite artwork from any card so far: "Under the Shadow" treachery card.

 Hero: Boromir. What a beast!

Player card: Song of Kings. Not including a Leadership hero yet still being able to play Steward, Sneak Attack and Snowbourne Scout helps me so much as a solo player.

Special art award: Song of Travel.

I have to put a vote for the art on the Gollum objective card in Return to Mirkwood. I've loved that picture since the preview all those months ago, and to finally have it there when I played the scenario last weekend was fantastic! I have yet to actually beat the scenario, but can imagine, having made it past all those beasties and through all those tantrums, finally getting back to Thranduil's halls and flinging the miserable little wretch on the stones. "There's your grubby little imp! Quite the merry chase you led us on too, you little devil!"

Ahem.

Haldir is a very pretty card as well. But I have to pick Gollum :-)

I may not be qualified to judge yet, because I made the mistake of ordering RETURN with KHAZAD and now I have to wait for both to ship at once. I'm breaking it into several categories, because there are too many cards I love. 

My inner Bilbo likes Radagast. I like telling tales of the further adventures of the sometimes-hapless Brown Wizard.
My inner Pippin likes a card I don't own yet. Support of the Eagles, my deck is itching for three copies.
My inner Boromir likes, well, Boromir.

I have to give honorable mention to my Favorite Quest: Journey to Rhosgobel. As a big Eagle fan, I love the chance to save one's life. It's kind of irritating that if the eagle has 1 damage on it out of 20 HP, you lose at the end, that irritates my inner Bilbo. Still my favorite.


If we are allowed to include the core set in our considerations, I will switch my Bilbo/Pippin/Boromir choices to Eowyn/Steward/Gimli. difficult to use together in a deck, but my favorites.

Favorite Shadow card: Nazgul of Dol Guldur. When that thing hits the table, my blood chills and I can almost hear the Nazgul scream from the films. I lose shortly afterwards, but that doesn't ruin the magic of the moment.
