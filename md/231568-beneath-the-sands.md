2/2/0/2 Rohan Scout guy in spirit for 3? The meta shift is real.

 

Also, that neutral event... wat?

I like that Rohan ally -- and it's nice to see a Tactics side-quest worth having.

Been waiting for Dunedain Lookout since the Gollum cycle.  (Or a card very close to it.)

Would have preferred something other than spiders as main enemy. But the labyrinth aspect of the quest sounds interesting.

Dúnedain Lookout is very solid. On the other hand, I don't think the neutral event will be seeing much play

## 7 [PsychoRocka on October 4, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/231568-beneath-the-sands/?do=findComment&comment=2441753)

Woah... these allies are bananas. About time we get an ally that can cancel when revealed effects (albeit only on enemies)!

He has nice stats for his low cost of 2 as well which is always nice. Won't be too painful discarding him to use his ability as he has low stats but at the same time he will still serve a purpose until his ability is needed even with his low cost. 

 

The rohan ally is potentially even better. 2/2/0/2 for 3 is pretty good to begin with. The ability is fantastic (so long as you are running side quests) and allows you to utilize both the 2 attack and 2 willpower.  Its also another scout character so works with Scouting Party. Finally it doesn't even say player side quest so this is a great ally for Lost Realm and Angmar Awakened and any other quests that feature side quests. 

Not as crazy about the neutral event... 9 traits is actually quite a lot.... 

Even if all three heroes you run are different races lets say Noldor, Dwarf and Dunedain thats only three so far.

Lets say one of them is noble thats 4. Even if one is a ranger and another is a warrior thats still only 6. You may think it would be fairly easy to then get up to 9 with allies but the thing is the vast majority of allies are going to be the same trait as the heroes in a deck so for this example I've already given you would need something like a Rohan, Gondor and Ent ally in play alongside those heroes with the 6 traits. In the example FFG gave just Denethor and Elfhelm alone give you 6 traits but both of them have 3 each and there are not that many heroes that have 3 each the vast majority only have one or two. 

Then again we do have a bunch of attachments coming that will provide heroes with extra traits so those cards will make this event much more viable or at least playable in a wider variety of decks. I don't know, I see this being a very niche card considering most decks are at least somewhat thematic and run around just a few key traits and even those decks that do feature many traits will still only have 5 or 6 between their heroes and so you cannot play this card until you have a handful of different allies with different traits out. I guess its a card you want to play late game anyway for a big quest push and tons of readying so it doesn't matter quite as much that it has so much setup but there is always a chance that setup won't come together or that you will need it early game. Love the theme of this card but not sure how usable it will actually be.

Any Dunedain Ranger bumps you up to 8, which means you need just 1 more trait from the beginning to go.

Yeah I was trying to find a hero combination that would start with 9 traits out of the gate, but I couldn't figure one out.  You can get 8 without too much fuss.  If you are playing in a Saga scenario you'll have a Fellowship hero (or Baggins sphere Bilbo) which could put you over the top without playing any allies.

 

But at 8 traits, it wouldn't be difficult to achieve the 9th if you toss in an Ent, a Healer, or something like that.

That's a good point. Mega unthematic deck though.... Gondorian Steward, Rohan warrior and a Dunedain ranger from the north.

It's funny how such useless and pointless thing as a Steward trait became relevant just for this one event.

## 15 [NathanH on October 4, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/231568-beneath-the-sands/?do=findComment&comment=2441957)

Quite a few generally useful cards have fairly random traits too, and they fit in all sorts of decks. Warden of Healing will snag you Healer, Master of the Forge is a Craftsman, and so on. I just looked through the four decks we're playing at the moment, and total number of traits are 14, 14, 12, 10.

## 16 [banania on October 4, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/231568-beneath-the-sands/?do=findComment&comment=2441959)

Cool cards, though I fail to see how Rohan relates to side quests until now.

The neutral event is fine but still costs 5 resources. So even if the condition on traits is achievable, the cost, even neutral is hefty.

## 17 [NathanH on October 4, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/231568-beneath-the-sands/?do=findComment&comment=2441961)

The effect is extremely powerful, though. At the very least I think it's a staple card for Saga quests, where your extra hero can sometimes collect resource that are hard to spend, and you're likely to hit the Trait requirement or get very close just from your four heroes.

 

Unfortunately I couldn't find a 3-hero combination that has 9 different traits right from the start.

I'm a bit disapointed with the new Rohan ally. He has pretty good stats, but his effect is not related with Rohan mecanic at all.

I would have prefered they swap the ability of the Rider of rohan with the Dunedain Lookout ability.

 

Dunedain are obviously much more related with side quests. For instance you have the new Dunedain hero Thurindir, that give you the alibity to have a side quest in your hand first turn. And on the other hand, discard albilities are so much related with Rohan... It would have been so nice to have a consistent cancel of when revealed ennemy effects with Gameling in play...

 

And Rohan have already a lot of readying effects. Sneak Attack (or Ride to ruin) + Eomund for instance. Or Ceorl, or even the very expensive We Do Not Sleep.

 

And i still prefer the good old Rider of the mark as non unique 3 cost rohan spirit ally :-p

When I was reading the article and it mentioned 6 traits across just Elfhelm and Denethor I was instantly like wait 3 traits on Denethor...? Gondor yep, Noble yep, what else could possibly be on him.... then I see that it is "Steward".......

Pretty weird. No card cares about the "steward" trait and it does nothing whatsoever (except give you another trait for this new event). Also how is Steward a trait....? It is a title and position not an inherent part of his identity. Like it is an extremely important part of his identity but did not become so until he became the actual Steward.

Steward of Gondor attachment doesn't give the attached character the Steward trait it gives the Gondor trait because Steward is just a title and position not a trait. I feel like they just slapped it on for cards like this new event and other new cards we might get that want you to have as many traits as possible.

PsychoRocka, Stewards trait is obiviously a remnant of the past, thing that got ultimately scrapped and unused, just like Archer trait which is present on two cards from the core set and that's it. They added him to the new version of Denethor for the simple matter of consistency.

Woah the original Lore Denethor has the Steward trait as well... how have I never noticed that.

But the leadership ally does not... Seems extremely inconsistent if anything to me....

Steward trait on original version.

Then it is abandoned and not included on the second version for whatever reason.

Then for the third version they decide they will include it this time because they are releasing new cards that care about how many traits you have :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

Denethor ally looks pretty young to me in comparison to his heroe versions, maybe that version of him was not a steward at the moment. I don't really think that Lead Denethor's Steward trait retainment has anything to do with this new event, they just kept it because original Denethor hero had one.

## 25 [PsychoRocka on October 4, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/231568-beneath-the-sands/?do=findComment&comment=2442043)

Yeah fair point. If memory serves correct he was somewhere in his 50's/60's when he became Steward so it is definitely possible that card depicts him before that happens. You are probably right as to why they included it but it just seems silly that all three don't have the Steward trait or preferably none of them do.

I am not claiming I have ever been very good at picking power of cards. On the contrary, many times I have misunderstood. However, I think I have understood the value of global boosters. For instance I knew Lords of Eldar would be extremely powerful in a right deck, in fact a maker of a Noldor discard deck, despite the general lukewarm reaction from the small community. I feel absolutely certain that The Free Peoples has a great potential in any ally heavy deck, not devoted to a particular nation. Not that Gandalf/Vilya deck needs much help, but it will be an absolute winner there, more so with the potential of playing it via Vilya.

Or a Caldara deck that doesn't care what traits is going in it. 5 resources to ready a huge army seems pretty good.

## 28 [banania on October 4, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/231568-beneath-the-sands/?do=findComment&comment=2442049)

I must add that in a lot of decks (mostly trait-based decks!), 9 different traits is not that achievable. For instance, playing my Gondor swarm deck (mono-ledership Faramir/Denethor/Boromir), I have Gondor, Steward, Noble, Ranger, Warrior, Healer (when I get those Wardens out with A Very Good Tale or the Herald), which cap me at 5 or 6 traits. I could certainly get 3 more traits out, should I tech the deck for it.

 

But that's the point. I don't deny the card is powerful, but it requires a bit of teching if planning to include it in most of the decks. And still, you have to provide the 5 resources + teching for an event you might not even draw, or have the resources to play

Well, if I was gifted with the divine power to change all cards on the earth by my sheer will, every version of Denethor would lose the Steward trait. They can't go back in time and remove Steward from Lore Denethor, so that's why they prolly felt obligated to include the Steward trait into his Lead version.

A ringbearer alone adds another 2 traits hobbit and ring-bearer so as long as you aren't using hobbits that is.

Way easier to use in Saga quests/Campaign mode.

It's a hefty requirement, a hefty cost, and a hefty event -- boosting willpower and readying *everyone* (not just your characters), is huge.  Yes, the setup requirements are substantial, but it's a late game card, and since it's neutral being able to afford it late game isn't that problematic.  If you have Steward of Gondor, that's one turn's resources.

 

Is it usable for thematic non-polyglot decks?  Probably not.  But then, the actual fellowship was explicitly and intentionally varied to represent the free peoples, so the title is certainly thematic.

## 32 [dalestephenson on October 4, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/231568-beneath-the-sands/?do=findComment&comment=2442230)

Eagles will be great for qualifying, because they all provide two traits (Creature, Eagle) that no hero has.  The last Eagles deck I played had TaTheoden/TaAragorn/Dori for six traits, and since it had 3x Honour Guard and a companion deck that was providing Steward of Gondor, getting to nine traits would be no problem.

Vilya "plays" all the events you try to use it for, so you can't get around the restriction this way. Source: that thread in the rules forum I should really save a bookmark for sometime.

Of course, this is a good summary. And also a nice thing to say about the design of the card. I dislike designs which always work. For Lords of the Eldar, you need mostly Noldor and some discard tool, for The Free Peoples you need a variety of traits: most of the "nation" decks will not work. The good thing for the play itself is, that you usually want this effect when there are more allies in play -- more characters get ready and get the boost -- which is when it is much easier to achieve the requirement.

5 resources is the least restrictive requirement for playing this card.

> I'm excited about the focus on traits! It also pushes me out of my tribe building tendencies.

even if i'll never use these cards, i'm really loving that it's already forcing people into rethinking how they build decks to get 9 traits, or including an Elf and Dwarf, or Ranger and Warrior, or perhaps all of them in the same deck... what decks they currently have that would need to be reworked to include this card, for example, or new decks that could be designed.

if i were a developer and came up with this card, that would absolutely be the perfect response after spoiling this card i think. these cards, like a lot of cards that came out in Angmar Awakened, really open the design space for how you can build a deck.

it's a neutral card, but one that really can't fit that well into many existing decks, and every existing deck that meets its requirements did so incidentally. now, people have a specific reason and goal to try to gather as many traits as possible when building their deck.

i know the player card pool isn't as big as other card games because so many released cards are for enemy AI, but this game has been out for what? 5 years now, and it's completely changing how people look at building decks, and that is the hallmark of a great card that comes out this late in a game's cycle imo.

On a slightly different note re: The Free People, it's just occurred to me that 'late game' cards have added value in the current trend in the game, because quests tend not to end easy and start hard anymore. I remember the early days of the game where you only really had to survive the first 2 rounds effectively to squash the quest, but now quests are usually balanced to either stay just as difficult or get more difficult as you flip through quest cards. So these 'late game' push cards are increasing in value. I may have to start including them more.

The more I think about it the better the Free People seems.  Once the Sands of Harad comes out, how many people are going to make a Three Hunters deck using the new Gimli and Legolas? They already have five and then you get seven with Aragorn.  Throw in a Robin Smallburrow with Hobbit and Shirriff traits (if you have lore resources) and bam, 9 different traits with 4 characters!

The Free Peoples will also be easier to play with all the quests that give you Objective Allies. Like those Dreamchaser quests where you are given allies with Corsair and Raider traits.

Yes, I started checking immediately. My Gandalf deck has 16 different traits and I do not think there ever was a game when I would not have nine by the end of it -- unless it was that typical first round scratch due to a fallen hero.

 

Robin and Denethor have the two special "status" traits (and I hope to see more of those at some point). But it is also easy to get a craftsman every now and then. Healer and Scout have got great boosts lately, whilst warrior and ranger and noble have been popular since the start.

You know the cardgame took a wrong turn when building a deck around the *actual* fellowship of the ring is considered unthematic. Which the designers obviously are trying to remedy in this cycle. We've already seen a couple of cross-trait cards and I'm getting the feeling that they'll try to push players out of the single-trait deckbuilding.

 

It's interesting that originally the game was designed around spheres and the idea that, like the book, different people would come together to stand against the darkness. Ever since we've had the Dwarves though, fans have requested all traits to be viable. I still think it's sad that 'thematic' is a term used to describe single-trait decks and 'unthematic' is used for cross-trait decks. Especially since a big part of the Lotr story is about characters from all walks of life overcoming their inward view and learning to respect each other and work together.

 

No matter how hard Caleb is going to try, the most thematic pairing in the game is Zigil Miner and Imladris Stargazer. These two interact in a way that feels exactly like Gimli and Legolas did in the books: they don't *need*  each other to work, yet together they achieve amazing things. #bestlovestoryinlotrlcg

Well, one of the main problems stems from the synergy cards provide to certain traits. If I'm using Celeborn, I'm playing O Lorien. So then it makes sense to play a lot of Silvan. All of the tribes have this synergy, making these tribal decks common. Hirluin, Spirit Theoden, Dain, Leadership Boromir, Ally Treebeard, etc. You're not optimizing your deck by paying for allies without matching tribal traits. Maybe if there were cost reducers for Warriors, Rangers, Scouts, Healers, etc, we could make these multi trait tribal decks without sacrificing efficiency. Just a thought.

If there were a critical mass of cards (or just a few heroes!) that create new "tribes" out of traits like Warrior, Ranger, or Noble, then you'd see people playing fewer of the traditional tribal decks.

There was no Steward of Gondor nor anyone from Rohan in the fellowship.

I actually disagree quite strongly on this point.

There are definitely combinations that are thematic but just throwing together some heroes and saying its thematic because all the free peoples had to unite to stand against the darkness to me is really silly.

There was one fellowship.... not multiple ones.. there was ONE group of diverse characters that set out as the fellowship.

Dwarf and Elf relations continued to be pretty absymal in the third age (Gimli and Legolas are the only exception to this).

Denethor doesn't even except that help will come when the beacons are lit. The dunedain act secretly and on their own in the shadows to protect the people of the Shire, Bree and the surrounding areas.

Remember the LAST alliance of Elves and Men, it was exactly that a last alliance where they marched together. We do not see that in the Third Age outside of Legoland and Gimli. Contrary to Peter Jackson's nonsense there were no Elves at Helms Deep.

Yes part of the story is about a group of characters from a diverse range of backgrounds and races coming together to form a fellowship but other than the fellowship itself most of the races and groups of people in middle earth are actually quite wary and/or dismissive of other races. Hell the people of Bree and surrounding areas are mistrustful and scared of the Dunedain Rangers which are the only thing keeping them safe.

So yes a fellowship line-up is thematic, yes a three hunters deck is thematic. Merry pippin and treebeard is thematic. Hell you could even say that Rohan and Treebeard (and Ent allies and whatnot) are thematic when playing the Isengard Saga Box as the Ents and Huorns destroyed the fleeing uruk-hai after Helm's deep and assaulted Orthanc. They don't actually fight alongside each other but do have a common foe and both fought great battles in Rohan at the same time. A Gandalf deck heavy on eagles you could call thematic considering his connection and friendship with them. Also cross trait decks can be thematic too so long as it is people that actually did work together in some way. A Dunedain/Noldor mix is thematic. As is a Silvan/Noldor mix, a Rohan/Gondor mix or even Dwarf/Hobbit can be considered thematic.

Throwing Boromir, Galadriel and Hama in a deck that has Ent and Eagle allies because they all work well together and it is a strong no nonsense deck is all well and fine. But it is not a thematic deck by any stretch of the imagination. None of these characters fought together or were even in the same place very long or at all.

Also just to be clear I'm not saying people SHOULD play thematic decks people can use whatever they want in this game which is part of why its so amazing. A hero line up or decks are not thematic just because a diverse group of characters are included though.

Also if you hunt around on the forums you would realise that it seems to be fairly accepted that the ultimate thematic way to play the game is to play campaign mode using only characters that were actually part of each scenario/quest and changing the line up following this rule as you go. These are decks built around the fellowship so your statement that decks built around the actual fellowship are considered unthematic is literally the opposite of the actual truth. Nothing is more thematic than a fellowship deck.

That is the actual fellowship however.... Your own version of the fellowship with Na'aisayah, Theoden, Erestor, Halbarad and Long dead Bard the Bowman/Dwalin is definitely not thematic just because it is a large group of peoples and traits coming together/fighting together.

Does it matter if your decks are unthematic though? Those who are actual sticklers for this and/or tolkien enthusiasts that want to use thematic decks will do so. Those who do not care so much will not.

Definitely depends on what versions of Legolas, Gimli and Aragorn you are running. 

Tactigorn, Tactics Legolas and Leadership Gimli only have Dunedain, Ranger, Warrior, Noble, Silvan, Dwarf so only six instead of seven (no scout on tactics Legolas).

Psychorocka, I enjoyed your post and it's a fair point that the fellowship's racial mix was essentially unique in the history we have, and that some combination of peoples are thematic while others are not.

 

OTOH, the nested post where you said that a Steward of Gondor, Rohan Warrior, and Dunedain Ranger made for a "mega unthematic" grouping I do disagree with.  All three were involved in the Siege of Minas Tirith, and though they did not meet due to Denethor's self-immolation, they certainly could have -- and *would* have if Denethor had made different choices.  It might be unthematic for the Hobbit saga, but I think it's actually a very thematic lineup for Flame of the West.

 

There's actually precedent between the Hobbit and the LOTR for Dunedain among the fighters of Rohan and Gondor.  Aragorn served in both realms in disguise, and since the non-saga game is set between the two, in theory a Denethor/Aragorn [Thorongil]/Theoden grouping may have occurred in the historical timeline.  Theoden was born in Gondor and the speech of Gondor was used in Thengel's house, it's no stretch to think young Theoden may have spent time at Mundburg serving Ecthelion, who himself sought out "all men of worth from near or far to enter his service".

 

Balin and Bard are only provided in the Hobbit saga, but of the 76 years between the two sagas, Bard lived for 35 of them and Balin for 52 -- that would make them available for quests that *could* be produced in the game period, though so far the cycles hint or state a period close to the beginning of LOTR.  (If they are intended to all be in chronological order, and we place Dead Marshes/Return to Mirkwood in 3017 to coincide with the actual capture of Gollum, that leaves only one year for all the quests to be done before the saga quests start -- which in itself seems highly implausible.)

Good point re Aragorn fighting amongst and for the men of Rohan and Gondor as Thorongil.

Also yeah that line-up would be a fairly thematic line-up for Flame of the West so another very good point.

I think there are 2 different interpretations of "theme" here. One being that the game expresses general themes of the book (like different peoples banding together), and the other being a more rigid interpretation of the specific characters and races ever interacting within the universe. I am much more interested in the former myself, so I am super happy about where this cycle is going.

While I don't necessarily disagree with this (a Three Hunters deck IMO is indeed one of the pinnacles of thematic decks in this game), I am really bugged when people bring this up over and over again. Why? Because by this reasoning every build and combination is thematic. Which is ALSO true, because this is a thematic game in a general sense. Everything about it is designed to be thematic in the first place, so it feels like a tautology when people say "but the theme of LOTR is different cultures coming together so any combination of traits is thematic". Well, yeah, but that's a characteristic of the entire game. It's not like we're gonna see lightsabers or Sauron-aligned player cards or something actually unthematic in a general sense. So why state the obvious? When people say thematic or unthematic it's because they wanna differentiate between decks that grab characters all over Middle Earth and decks that keep characters that belong to the same  realm or might have known each other. Sure, thematic is not the word to call it, but it seems you're forgetting that, by your definition, pretty much everything (except maybe Eagles in Moria, etc) is designed to be thematic because that's the whole point of the game; there are no "unthematic" possible lineups in this game by your definition just like there are no unthematic possible business-related outcomes in Monopoly. So, the word is useless, either change the definition or don't use it at all.

Your point is a good one, but I think what that segment of the community is saying is that "thematic" should indeed be abolished as a synonym for "trait-sharing" or whatnot. That many have settled on using it that way doesn't by itself make it right to do so.

Yeah, I agree with that. I don't say thematic myself when talking about trait-focused decks. I think though that it's weird people act as if the game being thematic and pointing it out was something new, when it's been staring at you right from the beginning.

i do think some people use the term really loosely though.

i saw a deck someone posted once with Treebeard and Elrond with the title of the deck including the words HIGHLY THEMATIC in all caps, which made me think 'oh yeah... that time Elrond went into Fangorn to get help from the ents...'

I am a bit confused about the confusion here. To me the term "thematic" in terms of deck-building is a term used for decks that follow certain theme, like Silvan or Rangers, in contrast to decks which do not follow a theme and just try to win. I do not see any problem in that terminology. But of course, one can have more than just a single culture deck and call it thematic. For ages, I have been running this sort of "Free Peoples" deck with representatives of different cultures coming together, calling it Council of Elrond. And naturally, you can find many themes, like Gondor joining with Rohan (as in the books) or Noldor joining with Dwarves (as not in these books). To restrain from the logical terminology seems absurd, but there are conflicting ideas about everything.

I don't think thematic is a terribly useful term, because it means different things to different people.  For trait-based deckbuilding, I think "tribal" is a better word than thematic, and there's a distinction between a thematic deck, a thematic hero lineup, and a thematic adventure.  Grima/Arwen/Cirdan isn't a thematic hero lineup, but could certainly be coupled with nothing but Noldor allies and a wealth of Noldor-restricted events and attachments.  Elrond/Elladan/Elrohir is a thematic lineup, but if it's filled with a polyglot mess of allies for Elrond to pop into play with Vilya, the deck isn't very thematic.  Treebeard/LoPippin/TaMerry is a thematic lineup, and can be coupled with a very thematic mass of ents and hobbit/ent boosting cards -- but sending that very thematic deck through Moria isn't a very thematic adventure.  Hardly any players are devoted to 100% purely thematic situations, as it would be rather limiting (and difficult) to only play Return to Mirkwood with one hero (Aragorn) and no allies.

 

So what's left?  There's at least thematic choices.  When I see deck notes describe a build as "thematic", I think that's code for "I know this deck would be better with card X, but I'm leaving it out for a weaker card with a better thematic fit."  The classic example of this would be the powerful and ubiquitous Steward of Gondor.  Providing extra resources out the wazoo *is* a thematic role for the Steward of Gondor, but putting it on anyone but Denethor or his sons gives no thematic to thrill to me.  Theme isn't the only reason to leave SoG out of a leadership deck -- you could just be bored with it, or not want to conflict with somebody else in a multiplayer setting, or you may intentionally want to have the power level of the deck weaker for a more challenging game -- but sometimes it is kept out *purely to avoid a thematic disconnect*, and a player making that choice is IMO a thematic player, even if his hero grouping or ally mix would never have happened in Middle Earth.

 

In short, there are thematic *choices* that can be made.  They may affect hero lineup, they may affect what's in the deck, they may affect what's *not* in the deck.  Thematic isn't a binary on/off switch, it's just a consideration that may affect any part of the game.

> Hardly any players are devoted to 100% purely thematic situations

 

I don't quite qualify, but for the Saga expansions (and associated PoD quests), my dream is to recreate the book as closely as possible. I was pretty successful at doing that for the Hobbit quests. You can read my playthroughs with accompanying thematic descriptions at http://talesfromthecards.wordpress.com/author/esteledain/ [http://talesfromthecards.wordpress.com/author/esteledain/]; I didn't do full write-ups for The Battle of Lake-town or The Battle of Five Armies, but you can find my decks for them on ringsdb: http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/715/bard-s-black-arrow-a-thematic-solo-lake-town-deck-1.0 [http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/715/bard-s-black-arrow-a-thematic-solo-lake-town-deck-1.0] and http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/716/three-armies-eagles-and-a-giant-bear-a-thematic-bo5a-deck-1.0 [http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/716/three-armies-eagles-and-a-giant-bear-a-thematic-bo5a-deck-1.0] (starring Ravenhill Scout!). I'm pleased that I got Bard to one-shot Smaug (with the help of The Old Thrush and other avian support), and that The Battle of Five Armies had a minor eucatastrophic moment when the Eagles finally arrived.

 

For The Lord of the Rings saga campaign, the player card pool doesn't yet have all the tools I need to build the decks I want to build. In A Shadow of the Past, for example, I don't want to include Merry (since he wasn't present until they reached Buckleberry Ferry), and I want to avoid (or at least minimize) combat with the Black Riders. Spirit Pippin, Out of Sight, Hobbit Sense, and A Elbereth! Githoniel! are how I want to deal with them,  but I need a great deal of willpower to pass hide tests (until I can get set up, and then engage the Black Riders and power quest while avoiding combat with OoS/H-s). I don't want many allies, since that makes Hide tests more difficult, so I want a few cheap high willpower allies (preferably Elves or Dúnedain, though hobbits and even dwarves could be thematic) and willpower-boosting attachments. A Spirit Sam hero (which seems likely to arrive at some point) would help, since then I would start with two Spirit resources, allowing me to immediately play a 2 willpower ally.

 

This is just one example, but there are many cards that I'm waiting for so that my player decks can stay close to the book and have a chance at beating the quests (such as ally versions of Merry and Pippin for The Road Darkens). As the card pool grows, new options arise. Spirit Legolas should enable a Three Hunters deck that has enough willpower for The Uruk-hai (especially as we get better Rohan allies, like Rider of Rohan). The quests from the fourth and sixth boxes will be challenging, since (with the exception of Journey to the Cross-roads) I want to play them with Sam, Galadriel, and Fellowship Frodo as my heroes, and no permanent allies (Elrond and core set Gandalf are fine). Even there, though, Strider and Vanish from Sight help (using the designer-approved house rule that you can play them if you control fewer than three non-Baggins/Fellowship heroes). As the card pool continues to grow, I'm patiently hoping for the cards that will let me recreate the book.

Estel Edain, that's really cool.  I think trying to construct the perfectly thematic deck for a quest is a great idea, and as the deck pool grows it becomes more and more feasible.  I used the example of a lone Aragorn deck trying to beat Return to Mirkwood -- but the Strider attachment makes that dream *way more possible* than it was before.  As the pool grows, perfectly thematic adventures becomes viable against an increasing number of quests.

 

But at the same time, playing *exclusively* perfectly thematic adventures would be very, very limiting and I doubt anyone does it.  I could be wrong, since outside saga quests, the Gollum quests in the first cycle, and the trips to Moria in the second cycle (not thematic if you win), there's a wider variety of heroes/allies that plausibly *could* have done the task.
