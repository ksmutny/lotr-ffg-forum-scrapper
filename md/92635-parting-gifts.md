The card is the next:

And my question is: can you move to your hero the leadership resources from other leadership heroes you don't control, heroes of your friends?

I asked this question once, and the consensus was yes you can... nothing on the card or in the rules, as far as we could tell, prevents it.

 

We didn't pursue an official answer though.

But then..., no all the people can play with the cooperative spirit 100%, it could happen that one player wants resources and other player also, the first player ask for resources to his 'friend' and he answers that not :angry: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_angry.png] . Nothing prevents that if the first player uses Parting Gifts, the second player losses his resources, lol!!! :rolleyes: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_rolleyes.gif]

 

 

Other card by the similar way is Dol Guldur Orcs: if you are the first player, can you place the damage tokens in the quested character of other player, even if he dies (one hero, do you imagine?) and his controller doesn't want? :blink: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_blink.png]

About Dol Guldur Orcs, yes. The first player can choose any questing character (controlled by himself or by other players).
