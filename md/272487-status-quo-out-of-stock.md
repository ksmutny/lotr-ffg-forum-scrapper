The oldest four adventure pack cycles are almost completely out of stock. This annoys me less for the availability and more for the fact that this actually not good for FFG. This is there company. People would buy more of their stuff if they sold more stuff. :wacko: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wacko.png] FFG, for your own sake (and that of new players), buy a faster printer.

Alternatively, we could crowd fund and get one for them. :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

They keep reprint supply low because a reprint run isn't nearly as profitable as the original run.

I would think that a second run (or third, or fourth) would sell out pretty quickly. I watch FFG's upcoming page and that seems to be the case with LotR LCG at least. Of course, who am I am kidding! I know nothing about sales success.

You probably don't.

If there is no further explanation your point will not convince anyone, since only the one who already know what you say will agree. So it is not very useful.

I probably don't know nothing about sales success? Why thank you, you're too kind! :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]
