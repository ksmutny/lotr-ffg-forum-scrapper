Thanks -- and thanks for the link -- just printed it out -- is there any other source for official rules clarification/corrections that I should have handy?

Haha ::hands book::

There are a lot of clarifications for different situations, these are not always easy to find.  Keep the updated rule book and FAQ nearby, and read through them before embarking on any quest.  If you run into a problem, come here and we'll get you sorted out.

There's also a unofficial faq that regroup all the answers from mail with Caleb, but it's quite a mess since answers seems to change over time. Well, it's mostly accurate and may be used as a shortcut if you're searching the forum for a duplicate of your question.
