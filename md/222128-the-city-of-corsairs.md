Fantastic stuff. Glad to finally see Tactics Imrahil after being wrong last pack. And Outlands support is fantastic!

 

Now who then will be the other hero in Flame of the West?

Intresting hero. Can we expect an Imrahil ally in flame of the west (the last sentence in Prince of Dol Amroth)?

The other Flame of the West hero will proably be Beregond then.

I am very curious about the Knight if the white tower. Seems very strong, he must have a setback somewhere

I'm thinking Prince Imrahil could go nicely in a Silvan deck. There are some nice Warrior trait Silvans, but you can also give him Elf-friend to play the rest. And then you can play your Feigned Voices/Pursuing the Enemy/Island Amid Perils to return the ally to your hand so it doesn't get shuffled back in at the end of the phase.

## 7 [Slothgodfather on June 8, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/222128-the-city-of-corsairs/?do=findComment&comment=2257585)

Prince of Dol Amroth seems extremely situational, but also a new way to build some outlands decks.  yes I know the consensus here is to hate them, but building a powerhouse machine like that is still fun.

 

A new Beregond would be awesome, but I'm afraid of what his power level would have to be to get me to stop running his current version.

I'm totally fine with the Outlands support. If anything, it will help richly thematic (or tribal if you dislike the term) Outlands decks, now with Hirluin and Imrahil!

 

Also, I'm tempted to say this cycle has seen and will see better Gondor support than even the Agaist the Shadow cycle!

I'm excited about the Knight of the White Tower. Gondor are supposed to be great at defence (e.g. extra bonus on For Gondor!) but all the good defensive stuff is in Tactics (Beregond, Shield, Defender of Rammas), so Leadership Gondor tends to end up chump-blocking quite often.

I suspect the Knight keyword will be something like "doesn't exhaust to defend". And yeah, I agree with your analysis, that's why the White Tower Watchman is so great! Here's hoping this ally wors great in the same deck.

When I first read Slave Ship, I read "deal 1 point of damage to non-Ship characters" rather then "deal 1 point of damage to a non-Ship character" ... What a difference a few letters make!

Keyword? It's obviously a card text that refers to the card itself by name. Also, with such high stats for his cost, I suspect his text is going ot be a tradeoff/downside.

I'm glad they made Prince Imrahil gain Outlands trait via an expensive attachment so he wouldn't be immediately ridiculous in an Outlands deck. This Imrahil will also he able to help in Gondor decks that like to use A Very Good Tale to muster allies because he can pop one in for a single resource that can then be exhausted for AVGT. I'm not sure how much I'd like him with Theoden and Eowyn, like the article suggested, but who knows.

Yeah not that fond of Outlands getting even more powerful, not matter how thematic that Title card is. I am sick and tried of seeing every other deck on ringsdb including Ethir Swordsman as it is...

Anyway, Imrahil seems like a Hero you could fit into many different types of decks. Nice!

I don't remember where, but i remember somebody speaking about a new imrahil hero version could be released in this cycle. You guys remember where did it happened? And how is spoken it? I'm curious... How could it known? Just musings... or there was any clue to think about this Imrahil?

I did, when A Storm on Cobas Haven was anounced, they teased a new Tactics hero, and since the quest takes place in Dol Amroth I speculated Tactics Imrahil was the hero in the pack, and it ended up being Na'asiyah. Had to wait for the very next announcent though!

Yes, it might have to be Beregond for Flame. It would be fun if he stayed with the same stats and become Spirit, thus within a box an ultimate defender and quester would swap spheres… and become very unorthodox in their new ones, Beregond even more so, I would say, no matter the ability.

By the way, Prince of Dol Amroth goes much better on the Leadership Imrahil, I feel. Him, Denethor and Hirluin will beat anything. But I might not bother trying, Outlands felt like cheating three years ago, they should be much more ridiculous now...

> I feel. Him, Denethor and Hirluin will beat anything.

That is exactly my plan when I saw that attachment.

## 32 [DukeWellington on June 8, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/222128-the-city-of-corsairs/?do=findComment&comment=2257985)

Initial observations:

A new archetype is emerging in deck design where you empty your deck so that you can control exactly what you put back and play over and over again. I see tactics Imrahil fitting into that style. For instance, with an empty deck and Beorn you can use Imrahil to attack for 8 every round. That can come in handy.

I like the Imrahil Silvan deck idea.

I just looked it up, the Elrond ally does NOT have the noble trait... bummer.

Red deck questing is becoming a thing, and I definitely approve. I like color identity as much as anyone, but certain aspects of the game (like questing) are too indispensable to be eliminated from a color. Imrahil is a good questing hero because his ability still applies while exhausted. I think this is one of the most important areas in the game to improve and I'm happy to see that the designers agree.

I love power decking and it seems that Outlands has no cieling. The pack does not, however, actually improve the trait. Unlike Silvans, Outlands does not benefit from allies coming in and out of play, so Imrahil does not fit even with the title. Also, the title grants one extra resource a round, which is nice, but at a cost of 3 it takes three rounds to break even. If you compare that to leadership Denethor the contest is a complete joke. Outlands decks don't take that long to destroy quests so the title is not even worth playing. Oh well.

So, the article and pack are titled "The City of Corsairs", but the partially spoiled quest card says "City of the Corsairs". Which one is it? Something tells me it originally was "The City of Corsairs" but as an afterthought they decided to change the cards so it says "City of the Corsairs" becuase they didn't want too many more packs beggining with "The", but forgot to change the packaging.

But you will draw Beorn after you shuffle him into an empty deck... Enter Miruvor, heh. (An idea, like so many, from the head of Seastan.)

Why do people think Leadership Imrahil is better for Outlands? His ability is counter-intuitive to building up an army. Tactics Imrahil creates more bodies to use A Very Good Tale on and get temporary bonuses from.

I think the biggest gain is the Outlands trait, honestly. Giving Imrahil the bonuses from the allies is probably going to be huge. A potential +3 to any of his stats will be ridiculous.

Running Leadership Imrahil lets you play Lord of Morthond which is pretty good. Also there are many more leadership related Outlands cards.

 

Also I am just now realizing that now that we have In Service of the Steward, you can give any ally Sword of Morthond too. You could make OHaUH Gandalf 7/7/7/7 with that Outlands trait!

Why is nobody else discussing this aspect:

When I glanced as Inspiring Prescense" the upper-case "P" looks like an upper-case "D" and I swear it said "Inspiring Dress scense"

Sure the white robe looks good but it's not exactly groundbreaking on the catwalk.

I know it's not spelled that way but c'mon, look at the card and tell me you don't see it...

I dont know about "better", but I do know early game when outlands are weak. You have to use a guy or 2 to block while you're setting up your monster army it would give PI good action economy to help get through the early game until you are set up.

Yes, the attachment does not do much for Outlands. Except, the allies will leave play in such a deck if you want it or not -- and thus Leadership Imrahil, with the attachment, will usually get to use two of his boosted stats, so the cost might be worth it… but again, I do not see myself trying it...

Giving a hero with action advantage an Outlands trait is kinda bonkers to be honest.

Is new Imrahil a severe case of sphere bleed? His ability seems very much Leadership-y to me. This type of ally mustering shouldn't be in tactics, even as a combat action.

## 47 [John Constantine on June 9, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/222128-the-city-of-corsairs/?do=findComment&comment=2258999)

But it's not mustering, it's jump-in - kick some ass (or get your ass kicked for the team) - jump out (if your ass is still intact). Pretty Tacticsy to me.

I get that. I don't see how bringing in a temporary ally to chump block is worse than chumping to ready Imrahil. Yea, the action advantage is bonkers on an Outlands character (Forlong anyone?), but the trigger for that action advantage doesn't synergize with Outlands at all.

I don't think they really wanted to boost Outlands that much either, but so many people talked about the fact that Prince Imrahil should technically be Outlands, so they granted us our wish.

One last thing: pairing the new Imrahil with hero Gandalf could be awesome. Like with Elrond, Wizard Pipe could be used to set up the top card so you never fail with his ability... or at the very least you can see the top card.

First: Outlands deck doesn't necessairly consists of only Outlands guys (Envoy of Pelargir, sneaky Gandalf, etc). Also, there are some non-essential Outlands guys you can afford to lose (Hunters, Forlong, etc.). And, to top it off, you might even play multiplayer and someone else loses a character!

I think elves works crazy good with Imarhil.   You could give him elf-friend and then spam Galadriel and get out fast, powerful, and cheap attachments,  or Elrond of course as well.    Galadhrim Healer as well.  

Could also go with Nor am I a Stranger and use him for Rohan card draw with Gamling, when the ally leaves play return them to your hand.  Probably not a super strong combo, but a decent one.  Might be some play with Mutual Accord to fetch Eomund, let him die, ready all the Rohan (and Gondor) characters.

Beregond? Why the b÷;@/y heck doesn't anyone remember poor Halbarad?

And want to see Davy Jones (pirate with tentacles by John Constantine).

Galadriel needs to be played from hand, so she doesn't work in this case. The other examples should work though. Too bad Horn of Gondor doesn't work to get the resource back anymore unless you're chumping that ally.

Well, it has been three years, but my Outlands deck used to rely heavily on chump-blocking, always in the beginning, and sometimes latter game too. And it makes all the more sense to use them for it considering Men of the West and Lord of Morthond, you actually get rewarded for doing that.

Halbarad is quite likely to show up in Flame of the West, but I think most people are mentioning Beregond because the Battle of Pelennor Fields is a big moment for Gondor, so it seems likely that we'll get a Gondor hero (like Theoden in Treason of Saruman). With Denethor and Imrahil now quite unlikely as heroes in the saga, Beregond is the most prominent Gondor character from the first half of Return of the King. On the other hand, Beregond doesn't participate in the battle. A Leadership Eomer hero would also fit, but might make the box too Rohan-focused (so we might get an Eomer ally). Given that the quests focus on the Grey Company, a Spirit Halbarad hero is definitely posssible (and the Dunedain are thematically connected to Gondor). At this point I expect an Imrahil ally (Leadership?), and Beregond, Halbarad, and Eomer characters to show up. That leaves space for one (or two, if one of the above doesn't show up) more ally, who might be Merry, Denethor, or the twins.

Sneak attack on a stick for a hero ability is pretty nice, especially because it can be used when exhausted.

 

Another hero specific attachment? Yawn.

Well, I wouldn't mind seeing a specific attachment for Imrahil, if it didn't have to do with Outlands -- although it does make sense, thematically. On the other hand, I feel like the Outlands are the biggest trait mishap of the whole design.

new Imrahil is nice .. gives the opportunity to make a good-willpower-mono-tactics-deck or gives you tactics in a non-mono-leadership-outlands-deck. 

but his action is kinda lame. it's the same like many events but with cost of one res and mostly no idea if you find a perfect ally for solving the current situation (e.g. hero will die - need chumpblock) ..

Nice hero. Nice attachment. Built in sneak attack is very strong. Look forward to trying him out.

Also very excited for the 3 Gondor allies. That Knight of the White Tower looks fantastic. Very much looking forward to see the text associated there.
