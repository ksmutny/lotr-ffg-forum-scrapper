Just made it to 3b, Escape to Buckland. Quest card says to reveal a black rider and that it cannot be cancelled. Does that mean I can’t use Frodo’s ability with the One Ring to cancel the effects of the Black Rider that was just revealed? I am trying to avoid having to do the Hide 2 test (as All my characters are currently exhausted).

Stopping Frodo's ability is exactly what Stage 3b is designed to do, I'm afraid.

I was afraid you would say that... looks like Sam and Pippen are about to take two undefended strikes....
