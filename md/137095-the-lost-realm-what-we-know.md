As I did with the last cycle I am going to collect the tidbits of information that we have in one thread.  I am of course going to collect the Angmar Awakened information here as well in the succeeding posts.

 

The Lost Realm

Aragorn – Tactics

Halbarad - Leadership

 

Leadership – Ranger Summons (1) - Event

Leadership – Heir of Valandil (2) – Attachment

Leadership – Weather Hills Watchman (2) - Ally

 

Lore – Expert Trackers (0) - Event

Lore – Sarn Ford Sentry (3) – Ally

Lore – Athelas (1) - Attachment

 

Spirit - Ally - Warden of Annuminas (4)

Spirit - Attachment - Star Brooch (1)

 

Tactics – Dunedain Hunter (0) – Ally

Tactics – Tireless Hunters (1) – Event

Tactics – Secret Vigil (1) - Attachment

 

{Neutral – Ranger of the North (-) – Ally}

Neutral – Gather Information - Quest

 

As always if I’ve missed something let me know and I’ll update/correct the thread.  I’m a little unsure how to classify the side quests because it looks like “Delay the Enemy” from Wastes of Eriador has Tactics colors.  Also, Ranger of the North is technically an encounter card, but I’ve put it here since it is the consequence of Ranger Summons.  Nice art on that one… ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

Many of those cards were announced in the Wastes of Eriador article, but we do not know that they're actually from the pack, such as the Veteran of Osgiliath.

Veteran of Osgiliath is in Wastes of Eriador. The little symbol in the bottom right hand corner of his card is the same as stage 1B "Across the Wastes" from the quest. Other than him and Honor Guard, I would agree you can't confirm some of the others.

## 5 [Gizlivadi on March 7, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/137095-the-lost-realm-what-we-know/?do=findComment&comment=1480701)

They all have the same symbol because they're all from the same cycle. There's no individual symbol for each pack. The only indicator we have is the number, and considering the fact that the Honor Guard has the number 4 and that the number in the Veteran looks like a 20 or 30 something, I would say that it's not from The Wastes of Eriador.

Ohhh, my mistake. I suppose they're just showing a bunch of cards that are affected by Valor for that article.

As we get more information I will put the cards where they should be.  For the moment I'm going to leave them in Wastes.

The image at the top of the announcement article for TWoE shows that Ranger of Cardolan and Scout Ahead will be in Wastes of Eriador because it shows them with the encounter cards,  Honor Guard will also most likely be in Wastes because its collector set number is 4.

 

Hope Rekindled, The Door is Closed, Tale of Tinuviel, Hold Your Ground, Delay the Enemy, and Veteran of Osgiliath are spread throughout the cycle.  We know that Delay the Enemy will not be in EfMG because its description page says we'll get a spirit side quest (unless the pack gives us two side quests), and we probably won't get Hold Your Ground either because EfMG's 2 Tactics cards are supposed to be Ent-themed.

 

I don't see you have that EfMG has a spirit side quest.

We know for sure that some player side quests do have a sphere, like Scout Ahead, Delay the Enemy and the unknown spirit side quest, so I think it's safe to assume Gather Information is a neutral side quest. 

 

Also, while Ranger of the North has the encounter keyword and card back, I think he'll count towards the player card count in the Lost Realm, but maybe I'm wrong.

I made the changes by adding an "Other Known Cards" section.  I didn't realize that Wastes and Gram had their own product pages already.

 

Regarding Ranger of the North, I believe the card back will be an encounter card back and he will not be shuffled into your deck.  If you play Ranger Summons then you take the card from an out of play state and shuffle it into the encounter deck.  If you have a card like Hennemarth in play that can be doubly valuable.

I think there is a pattern regarding hero spheres, which makes it easy to believe that we will get a Spirit Dunedain hero in this box. Here is why:

 

- The Core set contained only Tactics and Leadership dwarf heros. What did we get in Khazad-dum? Spirit and Lore.

- Gondor Core set: Spirit and Lore. Heirs of Numenor? Tactics and Leadership.

- Rohan Core set: Leadership and Spirit. Voice of Isengard? Tactics and Lore.

- Dunedain Core set: Leadership and Lore. The Lost Realm? Exactly!

 

It seems pretty clear that the designers sooner or later want every trait to be represented in every sphere, so that even the most thematic deck builders can build a deck using their favourite spheres. I think that's pretty cool.

 

(P.S.: by the same reasoning, the deluxe expansion after The Lost Realm should bring us more elves, who were only represented in Tactics and Lore in Core set days. =) )

This is very clever, a great observation. And only a Spirit hero away from being true, plus we can easily get a Spirit and a Leadership Elf in the next deluxe. Elves do deserve a deluxe box.

 

However, I doubt designer plan as much as we would like to see oft. I believe the process to be more random. There had been patterns that later fell apart. And Spirit seems the least candidate for a Dúnedain hero right now. Still, if it is correct, I will bow once more.

We haven't seen any Spirit cards yet.  Perhaps we aren't getting any until Wastes?  They certainly ballyhooed Spirit Noldor...

Nah, we'll get spirit cards in The Lost Realm I think... Maybe not all of them will be Dunedain themed though, possibly we get some hobbit synergy.

The two Spirit cards (all thats left unspoiled) will be an ally and an attachment and from this quote about the box "new Dúnedain allies for each of the game’s four spheres of influence, and a handful of events and attachments that help your Dúnedain , Rangers , and other characters track down and defeat foes that might otherwise threaten the simpler folk of the North." all allies will be Dunedain but the attachment could be anything..

I remember that line now an agree that we will get a Spirit ally, but I don't see how you divine that the other Spirit card will be an attachment. (?)

If that list is right it looks like we're getting an ally, an attachment, and an event from every other sphere so I don't know why you guys are assuming we'd only get one or the other from Spirit.

## 19 [Catastrophic09 on March 13, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/137095-the-lost-realm-what-we-know/?do=findComment&comment=1488985)

Because the card numbers which we know clearly show how much space is left for player cards. In these Deluxe boxes we never get every card type from all the spheres, instead we get 2-3 cards from each sphere so some get more love than others. Back to the card numbers.. 1&2 are the heroes, 3-6 are allies, 7-9 events, 10-13 attachments, 14 is the side quest, 15 the neutral Ranger of the North guy who gets shuffled into the encounter deck and 16 goes into the encounter cards starting with the objective-ally Iarion. Thats why I said 6 and 13 would be Spirit because thats what is missing and the order makes it clear it would be an ally and an attachment.

You're right, I wasn't paying attention to the card numbers.

Interesting. I wonder if the Ranger of the North bumped the other Spirit card out. All previous deluxe boxes had the player cards divided evenly amongst the spheres, didn't they? (Heroes excepted, of course)

## 22 [MyNeighbourTrololo on March 14, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/137095-the-lost-realm-what-we-know/?do=findComment&comment=1489483)

Ranger of North could take the neutral slot. Or there was other neutral card spoiled and I forgot about it?

## 23 [Catastrophic09 on March 14, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/137095-the-lost-realm-what-we-know/?do=findComment&comment=1489494)

The player side quest I think is also neutral along with Ranger of the North.  

 

This website [http://ffgapp.com/static/ffgcatalog/lcgmc/#/products/117] is beautiful by the way to see all the cards from their original boxes easily. Over time the card numbers have been organized differently in the Deluxe boxes for example Khazad-dum ordered the cards by spheres and Leadership and Tactics got 3 cards each while Spirit and Lore only got 2 and then 1 neutral. Heirs had a lot of player cards: 4 each of Leadership and Lore while Spirit and Tactics got 3 each. After Heirs the order of card numbers goes by type rather than sphere which only matters when we try to now figure out what future cards are! lol  Voice gave us 2 cards for Leadership, Lore and Spirit while Tactics and neutral each got 3 which is crazy for neutral but Road Darkens also had 3 neutral cards.

 

So, no the cards have never been divided equally and even in a couple of the last packs from the Dwarrowdelf we got 0 neutral cards and 3 Lore cards! So the designers aren't afraid to change things up a bit with lots of neutral cards or maybe an expansion with far more of one sphere.

 

fun fact: there are currently 81 cards for Leadership, Tactics and Spirit but Lore has 84. Neutral has 32. So even though cards aren't divided equally from each pack they have still been well rounded except for Lore who has a few extra. All these ridiculous numbers have come from being obsessed with this game yet being stuck in the current drought.. hahha ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

I found this on the Grey Company Facebook page.  Here's what I can make of it.  These are just guesses, so correct me if I'm wrong:

 

Borders of Bree-land

Arnor.

While Borders of Bree-land is in the staging area, it gains: "Forced: At the end of the quest phase, return 1 enemy engaged with ________ player to the staging area."  (The blank is probably "each" or "the first".)

 

The Shades of Angmar 1B

When Revealed: Each player must search the encounter deck for a ______ [?Baleful] Shade and put it into play engaged with him.  Shuffle the encounter deck and reveal 1 encounter card per player.

Forced: At the end of each _______ phase, each player must discard the top card of his deck.

If a player has 0 cards in his deck, he is eliminated from the game.

 

Biting Wind

Weather.

A..... _____________________ characters committed ____________________ number of characters.

Shadow: Deal 1 damage ___________________ character.

 

 

P.S. I wonder what would happen if someone scanned that QR code on the box at GenCon....

Well, the ffgapp page used to have a code for each Lotr product that was consecutive to the previous product, so you could actually go to the page of a future release, only to get a "this product has not yet been released" message. So I think that's what would've happened if you scanned that code in Gen Con.
