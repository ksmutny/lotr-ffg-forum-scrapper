I know of all the expansions this game has, and was wondering when can you add ally's, events and attachments from other expansions? Is there a ruling on when you can add new cards from different scenerio's to your deck?

Thanks for the help

You can add cards as you feel like it.

If you want a challenge you could choose to only add cards that were out at the time the quest you are trying to solve was out.

There are no limitations on this. Expansions and Adventure Packs both give you new scenarios and increase your player card pool. The heroes I use most all came in adventure packs.
