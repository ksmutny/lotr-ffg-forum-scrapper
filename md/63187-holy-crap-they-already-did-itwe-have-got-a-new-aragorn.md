 I'm into it. I wanted a more Strider-like Aragorn anyway. Makes me wonder what other heroes/allies they may give this treatment to. His ability is incredible.

 Hello, my name is Aragorn. I wear a sword and a jewel my girlfriend gave to me. I have 5 Willpower and can play lore, spirit and leadership cards.

At first glance, I don't think that his ability is that useful to maintain secrecy in a secrecy deck, since his starting threat is 12.  The lowest that you can start with him in a two hero deck is 19, only two rounds shy of 20.   On the other hand, in those games (using three hero decks)  when you are closely ticking torwards 50, a reset to your original threat seems like a invaluable lifesaver.   Still don't know how much useful he might be without also playing the broken sword attachment.  Then he becomes a monster quester.   This attachment might be even worth playing on the Leadership Aragorn even if he already is leadership anyways.

Funny how the featured Secrecy deck in the article calls for 3 Celebrian's Stones.  I see it as FFG's "subtle" push for us to buy three Core sets.  Really?  Aren't there plenty of cards available to build decent Secrecy decks?

It may not give you much time for secrecy, but it will give you secrecy when you know that you need it the most.  Say you have a hand full of secrecy cards but your threat is above twenty: pop Strider's ability and then go to town with all of those cards (some of which may lower your threat even more, keeping you well below twenty).

I really love the card art on "Strider", much more than the Aragorn that was released in the core set... (something about his face I think)

Nobody crying power creep and broken yet, weird.

Anyway, might be time to retire Glorfindel from my Lore/Leadership deck with Gloin and Denethor, throw in Strider + Blade (and Stone), then toss out Aragorn from Leadership/Tactics and put Imrahil in there. But where to put Glorfindel llorando.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/llorando.gif] ? Only deck with Lore left is Beravor/Eleanor/Eowyn and, well, can't toss out Beravor I don't think. And not enough leftovers for Leftover #2 deck.

Excellent point, however, when you play Secrecy you need the allies out fast (via Timely Aid preferably) or you are going to get bogged down by the threat accumulation in the staging area.  Without allies to quest (or optionally engaging enemies)  you are quickly out of Secrecy AND with a resource disadvantage on top of that.    You need those secrecy cards in your hand in the starting hand or very early in the game.     Most games that I have played using Secrecy are won or lost in the first few turns...

Really...it is already hard enough for 4 players not to complain about hero selection but adding a new lore Aragorn is going to push my group over the fence on this one. They couldn't think of any new heroes to add for Lore. They could have made a custom hero with the same stats and abilities. Sadly I think in order to keep my group playing we will have to house rule it that both Aragorns can be in play under two different players.

Personally I like this game but my group is getting less and less interested with all these new Ambush, Lost, and insta-lose treachery cards. I hope once they get through this cycle they will stop adding new rules for each AP and get back to the basics. I'm all for new Enemy keywords but not a new one every AP.

 I'm disappointed that by the end of the second year of this game we'll already have two Aragorns and two Bilbos. At this rate, I'll bet ya that Frodo's gonna get another version before the years' out. And why is he still a threat of 12? The reason I don't use Aragorn very much is because his threat is so high. I'm not gonna be any more likely to play this one than the last one since his stats are identical.

One thing's for sure, though: This one could be a game-changer for competitions.

While I'm horribly disappointed in FFG by re-releasing a hero already with the plethora of available characters that haven't had an adaptation yet, I think Lore Aragorn looks really interesting, and the Sword that was Broken pretty much makes up for it in my book. I've never been happier to already use Aragorn in my deck!

it had to be Strider. and i think that it is good that we get different versions of the same heroes instead of armies of new ones (same goes to new Bilbo). it gives those important characters an extra depth.

All right, that looks interesting. I hoped for a hobbit, but I guess I can life with that. A shame that Aragorn can't be partnered with a dwarf (only Bifur, but that's be a waste). Théodred looks like a good partner choice indee, the other ones being Frodo or Dunhere.

Next hero should be spirit, right? I cross my finders for a cheap (6-7 threat) hobbit. Pippin? Or a spirit elf?

the next hero will be

Actually it's, "Draw 14 player cards and exhaust Aragorn to reveal the finall quest stage. Then place 37 progress tokens on it."

It's OK. He's going to have a threat cost of 41. It's a very balanced card...

Not taking into account that they rereleased a hero we already have and that they had to so that other cards they designed make sense (I wonder which came first), you really have to admit the sword that was broken is very nicely designed fluff-wise.

## 28 [leptokurt on April 16, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/63187-holy-crap-they-already-did-itwe-have-got-a-new-aragorn/?do=findComment&comment=618433)

I don't think Strider's threat level is a problem for secrecy decks. One problem I faced in many of my games was that the secrecy cards were only available when my threat was already past 20. With Strider's ability the player can collect these cards and play them at a point he needs them. Needful Knowledge could lower the threat even more.

Btw, just run a Théodred/Frodo/Bifur secrecy deck against The Carrock. Lots of allies and "Hail of Stones" = Wow! Next time I will add Grim Resolve to my deck just to kill two trolls in a single round. "Unexpected Strike" is also neat in combat heavy scenarios.

Now I'm not saying he's a bad card, and I'm not saying they shouldn't make new versions of old heroes. I think you're right that it adds a lot of depth. I'm just surprised it's happened so soon.

I'd have to say, I'm still up in the air on the Bilbo thing. Re-releasing heroes doesn't add the kind of depth that this game should be working towards, it cuts back on the combinations you can have. You play Bilbo in any of your decks? Not anymore you don't. While the new Lore Aragorn kind of skirts the issue by being 12 threat (2 Aragorns wouldn't be feasible threat wise for a secrecy deck), if they start putting out duplicates of all the heroes they already have, I don't think this is a route FFG should take. It isn't like there's a shortage of characters to choose from...

im not a good enough deck builder to really take into account combos- i usually just make decks with characters i like..so its probably not going to affect me that much

Overall I still think the game is delivering top notch stuff, but like you Rich and many others here, I haven't been satisfied with the last two updates like previous ones. I also think it is a) far too early to spin off a Hobbit "saga" set (even though I love what I have seen thematically so far), and b) It is absolutely too early to release a duplicate hero when there are plenty of others to release for now.  I can't stress enough how torn I am with the new updates.  I love the art on all the new cards, but I just hope the rules work out without seeming too weird.

A couple of things jumped out at me:

One, the threat of 12 is odd for a secrecy hero. Though I suppose that can be explained as an attempt to balance the card. 

Two, given the cards we are seeing, it seems like leadership is a far superior fit than the other spheres because otherwise you miss out on the benefits of Celebrian's Stone and the Sword. Sure, you can add a Song and the Rivendell Minstrel but that just seems to make things more complicated and take away space from other cards. In fact, Theodred is such a much better fit than anyone else, I almost don't see why you would play him with any other hero currently available.

And what is with the mentioning of Boromir as a partner? Certainly not for a secrecy deck!

I don't think he's mentioned as a partner for a Secrecy deck. Aragorn's useful in any deck where your threat might eventually become a problem. Boromir and Frodo each have abilities that can convert stuff to threat levels (actions and wounds, respectively). Aragorn allows you to use them with abandon until the point you use his Refresh ability to drive the threat back down.

 I'm not saying that the game is dropping off, I really love it a lot. It has become a huge hobby of mine, and I'd hate to see it drop off. I still think it's a high quality game, I just wish they hadn't gone in this direction. Will I still buy the expansion? Yes. But do I wish they had put out a new hero and not Aragorn? You bet.

Can someone calmly articulate what all the hate is about? FFG is publishing a cooperative Lord of the Rings card game and putting out new quests to play quite regularly, including the Water. In. The. Freaking. Water. How cool is that? Not every hero is going to be one that you (or me) likes. They have to cater to everyone. And so far they're doing an excellent job. If you don't want the new Aragorn, then don't buy the Water in the Water adventure back. But I suspect that most of you will, because you actually like the game. And because the Watcher in the Water is awesome!

I'd be fine with it being a hero "I don't like" I just don't think it's good practice for them to put out a hero that's already out.

I like the new Aragorn.  I'm not disappointed at all, and I don't think it's laziness.  Most card games seem to have multiple versions of the same character.   Like someone else said, it adds depth to that character.  And we're still going to be getting many more heroes as the game develops... I don't see what there is to worry about.  It's an awesome game!  Then again, I'm still new to it (only 4 packs into the Mirkwood cycle), and haven't had time to get bored with the heroes/characters I have.  Maybe it would be different if I had more experience... I don't know.

The Bilbo in me is really excited by this. I've found it hard to include the original Aragorn into decks that weren't leadership heavy because I just don't like the combo of his high starting threat and his text being less than useful until you get your resource engine set up. In short, I just didn't see the King of the Free Peoples being wanted everywhere. But I can see all sorts of starting fellowships (sorry, old Decipher game coming back to me) for the Boromir in me to use with this Aragorn precisely because of the ability to see your threat climb up to 45 and go "WAIT!". In short, he's going to be wanted everywhere. 

One other thing that I'm thinking of: FFG needs to think long term if they want this game to continue, and I think this card shows that. Based on current patterns, we can expect 8 heroes every cycle. Sure, there's lots of characters that they could choose from, but many people are probably like me. They probably want to play with the 9 of the Fellowship, Bilbo, Faramir, and other big name guys. Mablung, Damrod, Halbarad...sure it'll be nice to see these people. But I want my heroes to be HEROES.

When the original set came out there was talk about including FFG originals such as Thalin as being kind of lame. Sure, the cynical side is that they're stretching out the heroes we want to make more money. But the objective side can admit that maybe saving some of the desired heroes, like Merry, Sam or Pippin, for later can help sell those later items. If getting a new Aragorn in a pack now means that they feel they can save Merry and Pippin to be the two heroes in the next Deluxe Expansion then I'm all for it. They need to sell the Deluxe Expansions so that people can pick and choose their adventure packs in that cycle. I see the Deluxe Expansions as key to the business model, because if you choose to not get one, you're choosing to not get the next 6 released items, either.

In conclusion: Aragorn now, mid-cycle, is probably good timing to save a desired, not yet released, hero or two for the next Deluxe Expansion. And I'll really want to play with this new Aragorn from a deckbuilding perspective, so I'm glad he's coming out now.

I would have expected the last two previews a year from now.  I don't think they are bad, I just think there are plenty of core elements that need developed before going off in the directions they are and reworking existing heroes.  Of course, I also felt that it was too early to start the Secrecy approach.  I appreciate that they are looking to keep the game fresh - just would have like to see some fundamentals developed further.

conykchameleon - where did you read hate, complaints about power creep and unoriginality?  Other than a few jokes, I missed anything real negative...just surprise and some mild critques.

They just screwed up, they probably meant Boromir, Imrahil (being also Dunedain although they are actually traited just Gondor in the game) and core Aragorn can all ready. It is a feeble line of thinking as we get Denethor and Beravor who cannot.

To add to the discussion: I am torn, also. While I think it is unnecessary to duplicate this early I like the new version of Aragorn much better. It feels much more accordiing to the story. He is sort of a hidden weapon - most of the game he is clearly not as strong as the guys like Imrahil or Boromir (not thinking the attachments now) but then he can change everything. And the spehre seems more fit - though obviously Aragorn was a great leader (perhaps just not in those years that much). Now to Glorfindel, I hope he is coming in this cycle already.

Hey, everyone gets an opinion right? =) I don't think Loragorn is unoriginal, and I think he does fill a gap the Lore sphere had. I almost think that if this had been a Tactics Glorfindel as someone mentioned I'd be frowning less and doing a lot more Tactics deckbuilding right now. Lol.

 I remember a comment about ''insta-lose'' treachery cards...I agree with it. I know we haven't been privy to a lot of the encounter cards from the next expansion but it is true that some of the later quests had a lot of ''When Revealed : All your heroes die'' kind of effects. I hope they will tone it down in the coming expansions.

As for Aragorn...well...the fact that they re-released a hero in a different version doesn't bother me : in fact I love it because it enables us to explore other aspects of the character. In fact, a lot of the characters sometimes seem out of place in their sphere...Bilbo could easily have been a Spirit hero, for instance. So a new Aragorn ? I dig.

However, I wish they would have made him more different regarding his stats, for example. That way he would have been thematically more coherent (I see Strider more as Aragorn the Quester / Ranger). That, and well...his ability is powerful, no doubt, but I never liked abilities that are one-use. If not for his sentinel trait, Aragorn is actually a blank hero for the rest of the game. Perhaps it's just me, but I like when my abilities see constant use.

Overall though, I'm sure this pack will be awesome :-)

Funny that you mention the lack of solo play cards in the current cycle because up until this cycle I haven't really gotten into solo deck building.  The secrecy cards have me intrigued for some possible fun solo play.  That being said I have noticed a bit of a flux in multiplayer only cards

Funny, I would heartly welcome if they would replace Beravor's ability with "Draw ten cards from your deck. Use this ability once per game."

Seriously, i think Strider's ability is that strong and cool that it makes up for being used only once.

I like it.  I've been solo playing with straight Lore, using Glorfindel, Beravor, and Bilbo and hoping for more Lore heroes to add, since Bifur is useless in solo play.  Bilbo and Beravor, on the other hand, are downright stupid-awesome in this deck, since all that card-spamming makes Guardian of Lorien insanely powerful.  Add songs of travel and you can combine Gildor Inglorion with Zigil Miner, and have all the resources you want.  Add fast hitch, good meals, burning brand, song of travel and boots of erabor and Bilbo becomes invincible, can play events for cheap AND he can refresh himself 1/turn.  Being it's solo, Bilbo also gives you 2 cards every round.  Its a great combo, so long as you add will of the west.  I've been able to beat every adventure so far without too much trouble, though return to Mirkwood is tough because your threat goes up so fast.

Therefore, I may replace Glorfindel with the Loragorn (aka Strider), which will mean resetting my threat once per game in addition to everything else.  I might even add a few broken swords and leadership cards to the deck, which makes it a straight lore deck with spirit and leadership capabilities and super-fast card draw, and potential for endless resources.  I don't miss tactics because I can add so many mirkwood runners and Haldir.

Thoughts?

No need to be derisive, friend. I clearly recognize the power of this ability...I just meant to say I prefer a hero with an ability I can use more than once...just feels more dynamic.

@Morithain : Well, if you play multi-sphere Bifur can be useful even in solo, because he can insure that you do not get ressource-screwed lore-wise. At least IMO. That, and with Dain he quests at 3 Will for a threat value of 7...not too shabby :-)

That's a good point about Bifur!  I never thought of that, for some reason I thought it had to be another player.  Good advice, I'll have to think about that.  But it would have to be pretty good considering the ability of this deck to create the ultimate hobbit juggernaut in Bilbo + fast hitch + erebor boots + good meal + burning brand + guardian of Lorien.  Considering the first three of those stat buffs cost 0-1 resources, it builds pretty fast.

I am currently playing with Bifur in a solo secrecy deck. As TFA already mentioned, he is good at collecting resources. He also has a low starting threat, he makes a good combo with Dáin and he's a dwarf, so you can use Erebor Record Keeper to ready him and all these other nice dwarven cards.

I still like Bilbo more, as his card draw ability is awesome (and not overpowered) and Fast Hitch can ready him without the need to pay for it

That's funny about Berevor used by 'loosers' hahaha...but seriously, she's awesome with Bilbo because it means four cards every round!  That generates so many cards, you can quest with one character as much as you need with discards (so long as you have will of the west!) when combined with guardian of lorien.  But I like the erebor recordkeeper idea. I use him to ready the Zigil miner twice; in combination with Gildor's ability, you can blast out 9 resources in one turn if you draw right.

What?  Beravor too powerful?  Sez who?  If you use her card draw power she can't do much else.  I don't think she's too powerful, though she's pretty good in conjunction with Bilbo in solitaire play IF you don't get bogged down with monsters and you need her for other things.

But I may try Glorfindel, Bilbo and Strider instead of Beravor, just to see what you're talking about.

 I just wanted to add that I played a whole mess of quests solo with an all Dwarf Deck and Bifur was an absolutely essential element. Especially with the Erebor Record Keeper AND the Long Beard Map Maker.

 

However, I can see why he wouldn't be much good in a mono-sphere deck.

 

 

I think the comment about Aragorn and Dunedain characters readying themselves was in reference to the earlier Aragorn and the elf twins.

I play Bifur in my mono sphere deck just because he is a second lore character that costs so little Starting Threat.  He is an above average quester and defender, plus, only 7 Starting Threat!

Beravor herself isn't overpowered, but:

Play Unexpetced Courage on her and you get five cards each round. Play UC twice or more on her and you get seven/nine cards each round etc. Add Will of the West to your deck, wait until you have all the cards (5-7 rounds) in your hand, play Sneak/Gandalf as often as you can, get the Sneak Attacks back with Will of the West and play them again. Play another Will of the West and play them again. That either kills every enemy around or lowers your threat by at least 30 points. Not to mention all the other nice things Gandalf can do.

That's why she is broken (and it's rather dull to play with her that way, believe me). If you house rule her, like not playing UC on her, she is fine.

Are you bychance the secondary account of booored? So she isn't overpowered but broken because there's a bunch of other cards that happen to allow you to draw more cards?! Maybe in bizarro-world. If you build a deck containing all of these cards, that's your choice. If you don't like the result, why don't you build it differently?

Anyway, I'll have to chime in and say that I, too, find it's too early to have duplicate heroes. I'd have hoped we'd see at least six different heroes for each sphere before there was any duplication. Then you could have two players playing the same mono-sphere decks, which might be an interesting exercise.

 A few thoughts:

firstly "Sword that was broken" - really? surely they mean "Blade that was broken." Also seems a bit weird that a sword gives a leadership rather than a tactics icon.

I don't think it's that big a deal releasing new copies of Heroes. This Strider is cool (although I prefer my own version) Disco Bilbo is hideous, and Glorfindel is pitiful compared with what Glorfindel should be.

At least whilst they're issuing additional versions of Aragorn or Bilbo, they aren't bringing out swarms of Hobbits who have no business in the game. The whole reason Bilbo was so significant was that what he did was so unhobbitish. Generic Took allies are reasonable, but I think it's already a bit dubious having Frodo pre-Fellowship, and I definitely don't want to see Sam, Merry or Pippin - none of them ever left the Shire or had any reason to! 

New heroes should be folks like Halbarad, Faramir, Theodred, Angbor, Thranduil, not characters who would never have been getting involved in fights with Orcs.

Bit annoyed about the sample deck list that is so heavily reliant on 3x celebrian's stone to play all of those Spirit Cards. Otherwise it's pretty cool.

Yeah, I can see that.  I've never considered playing her that way.  The combination of Bilbo and Beravor is already 4 cards per round, plus you add Gleowine x2 and you can get 6 cards per round without unexpected courage.  Using sneak/Gandalf is awesome, but I don't play any tactics with my deck, but it's not a bad way to go.

Gleowine is unique so you could not have more than one in play at the same time. I agree that Beravor by herself isn't broken because she forces you into a decision: exhaust to draw and not have her available for anything else or use her for something else but cannot draw. UC is what causes the issue since the ability to refresh a hero is huge.

Are you bychance the secondary account of booored? So she isn't overpowered but broken because there's a bunch of other cards that happen to allow you to draw more cards?! Maybe in bizarro-world. If you build a deck containing all of these cards, that's your choice. If you don't like the result, why don't you build it differently?

 

Anyway, I'll have to chime in and say that I, too, find it's too early to have duplicate heroes. I'd have hoped we'd see at least six different heroes for each sphere before there was any duplication. Then you could have two players playing the same mono-sphere decks, which might be an interesting exercise.

I am fine with Beravor, really. I just think that Beravor + 3 UC is exploiting a loophole in the game mechanics. There is a difference between drawing one, two or seven cards each round. A huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, difference. As I am not using Beravor, I apparently build my decks differently. Perhaps I am just too lazy to hold 50 cards in my hand. I prefer them lying next to me. gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]

I find it really bizarre to think that people who manage to buy and draw 3x unexpected courage (neither of these being a particularly easy task) have nothing better to do than put them all on Beravor for card draw- really? not on Legolas for 3+ attack (he invariably has at least one blade of Gondolin on him) and progress tokens? not on a sentinel defender? not on Dain so that he can use his 3 defence and still give all dwarves in play +1 attack, all on Beravor.

just seems incredibly dull

Very good point Mighty Jim. I also do not understand the strategy of drawing 8 cards with Beravor each round. In our play-group we have got 6 copies in total, so she could be drawing 14 in coop. But one needs money to pay for the cards too (unless he wants to feed them all to the Protector) and there is always Legolas, Dunhere or someone else needing Courage too. The new Aragorn seems like a good adept for it by the way.

The exception for me is when I play solo with Denethor (and the Hobbits usually), then there is no decision to be made: all Courage goes to the Steward with dull consistency.

Well, look at it this way. Once you are in a game, the two most important things your deck can do are draw your cards and collect the resources to play them. If you can do both these things in abundance, you will win a lot of games. It just opens up a lot of possibilities for you. Beravor and UC essentially use up one hero and one deck slot to take care of one half of this issue and that gives you plenty of room to work on the other half. Can it be dull and considered lazy? Certainly so. But it is also brutally efficient and that's why it gets a lot of use.

Feeding them all to Protector of Lorien is exactly what you want to do with the combo. Lets you finish quests in 1 round each (when there are no requirements other than putting progress on them).

Also, the other goal is to empty your deck, not so you can play the cards, but so you can then use Will of the West to set your deck with only the cards you want... like you are playing a 6 cards deck with 3 Sneak Attack and 3 Gandalf.

(Both these are mostly solo-play strategies, although they also work in coop; but in coop, it's harder to not share the wealth around, so UC often ends up on Ranged or Sentinel character)

May sound boring, but it works. To each is own.

 No, of course it works. And of course it is efficient once you get the combo going. But not only it may be a bit boring but perhaps also too slow, so either if you count the score or if you try to fulfill the potential of your many characters this may not be the best way around it. I am saying "may" though, I think it is questionable. I would be more certain about the Will of the West, to draw all but a few cards which you then recycle must surely take unnecessary number of rounds which you could otherwise spend by having already won the game and probably enjoy the variety of the process much more.

Having said that, more than a few times I have caught myself accumulating all the willpower for the final round, trying to hit over 100 with multiple copies of Astonishing Speed, Faramir on the Vigilant crack and feeding the Protector. To each his own indeed.

 I suspect the Blade that was Broken gives Leadership and not Tactics because it is not a usable sword (it's still broken afterall), but it is a symbol of the kingship of old.
