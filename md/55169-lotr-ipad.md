 What do you think of an ipad version of LotR card game??

I think that it would be a bad idea.  The complexity of the game and itneractions between multiple cards would make it difficult to code.  The game relies on monthly expansions, so creating the product would not be a one time investment, but a constant full time project that would require significant staffing. On top of that, I am doubtful that the market would be the price point necessary to make the product viable and that an ipad version of the game would essential be a competive product against the cardboard version of the game.

I agree with Bohemond, but I'm wondering if you could use Lackeyccg since it does run on a Mac platform. I have played using it on my PC and although its a bit clunky, it actually works pretty well.

I can't see a LOTR Card Game App coming any time.

I would like to see a third party deck building App though. For all the LCGs FFG produce would be nice.

 I could easily see a port of this game for the iPad. Don't know how but don't rule it out. There's another game, a CCT, where you buy it and then you can purchase boosters ingame. So you could do it here to. Maybe a strictly solo game would be most reasonable to expect though.

I would buy it for sure gran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif]

 I think an iOS version of the game CAN be made.  Look at the card game Ascension thst's on the iPod, iPhone, and iPad.  The app is amazing and lets you play this deck building game with up to 4 players.  What would be good for FFG to do is have the core app be the cost of the physical core set minus the physical production cost, shipping, and percentage going to stores... That way they are still making the same amount of profits.  Then have the expansions purchasable in the app itself like others apps.  

Keep in mind a lot of gaming companies are making tablet versions.  Look at AEG with there upcoming release of Thunderstone for iOS.  FFG is already supporting this idea a bit with their announcement of a Elder Sign game for the iOS.

 I was playing Shadow Era on my ipad. And thought about a lotr based game. I know there are some rules that are not easy to be adapted, but I think with some changes it could be great.

rubbish... you could easily code this card game into a computer game.. no worries.. (assuming you could get everyone to agree on some of teh terribly worded rules mean :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]) The computer version wouldn't have to be on the same release timing as the card game, they could do it by full adventure pack series at a time instead of individual ones. MTGo works perfectly and it has some pretty heavy rule interactions. 

iPad, not so keen on... but Steam/360/PSN version of the game like that Duels of the Planswalkers would be frickn awesome, do it for thrones and coc as well... Duels has made a fortune, topping sales charts for Steam, 360 and PSN... there is definatly a market for a games like these on computers,

Nothing about the production of magic in the digital format should be construed as easy.  It took years to make that product workable. 

MTG Online has brand awareness that this product doesn't have, and requires far more staff than FFG could commit to similar project.  I am skeptical of the success of a digital version without those resources.

 I'm going to dissent from the rest of the thread here.  I may be unique in that most of my iPad game time is spent on airplanes and other times where I don't have an internet connection or I don't want to commit a full 30min for an interactive online game.  So most of my gaming is solo.  I find the AI is not good enough to challenge me in most euro games on the iPad, while games meant to play solo do not have an AI problem.  For example Ghost Stories is the best iPad boardgame so far in that regard: it is challenging without an opponent.

I do think there will be some complicated interactions but this could actually make the game better if they coded and tested them before printing them.  This is how Dominion works now: expansions are all tested online before release.

This isn't true imo. Duels of the Planeswalkers on Steam / 360 and PSN hit a completely new market.. most players if you read the steam forum and even the wizards forum on the game have never once used a real card or played MTGo... it is a totally new market for these types of games.. and duels is a HUGE hit, as booored... said one of the top sellers on all 3 platforms... FFG would make lots of money if they did this with CoC, or the other LCGs and it would not affect negatively on card sales, infact if duels is anything to go buy, it would increase card sales

As for complexity of coding.. no.. it isn't hard. I made a 360 version of Call of Cthulhu for 360 and PC as part of my major project at collage. I did all the programming by myself, as well as the basic animations needed, and used card scans for GFX... the game worked flawlessly and looked pretty much the same as Duels... If I could do this by myself in less than 6 months... a team of professionals could do it easy. (mine did not have multiplayer though)

yea, but you wouldn't need a AI for LoTRs... the "AI" is controlled the games rules... it would be a perfect conversion of the game... no harder or easier than in real life.
