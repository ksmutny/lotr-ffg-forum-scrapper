Shamelessly lifted from BGG:

Modern LCG Core box size! Tiny threat trackers! Rewritten rules! (Online rules reference pdf to follow…?)

This is cute.

My flgs has the old sized boxes. Should I pick one up as an investment, or will this not affect the price of the last edition?

Huh, this doesn't seem like an FFG move. At least there are now two rulebooks. I wonder if this is a counterfeit like suggested in the BGG thread. By the way, those threat trackers look neat.

It will probably not affect the price.

From what little we can glimpse of the Learn to Play booklet in the pics, that would be a helluva counterfeit effort. They even went out of their way to define the "neither successful nor unsuccessful" quest state, a point even veterans often are shaky on.

Cool. Maybe this means more investment by FFG in their games beyond more mere expansions.

I'd LOVE to get some info on the "mere expansions" though. Am I the only one?

THEY DID IT!  A RRG! With a separate Enemy Attack framework!

That ruleset mentions "Online only" - sure this for the physical LOTR LCG or the new digital game? Scrolling through, perhaps it is the former.
Also, it's not the full rules system -

> Quote
> 
> "This document is intended as the definitive source for rules information, but does not teach players how to play the game. Players should first read the Learn to Play book in its entirety and use this Rules Reference as needed while playing the game."

Page 2 of the Rules Reference.

Also note the info at the bottom of the cover page -

> Quote
> 
> Rules Reference
> SUMMARY OF CHANGES
> New entries and changes from previous editions will be noted in this space.

So this is the second part of the rules, not the only part.

@timbolton [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/149249-timbolton/] The quote you point out and the note at the bottom of the cover page do point to this being only part of the rules. But this is consistent with modern FFG rulebook layouts. They did the same thing with Imperial Assault.

The revisited Horn of Gondor reads "destroyed", the version in that online rule book is the old one?! Does that mean, that they did not care to update their cards?!??? :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

They should've done the card illustration with the old Zigil Miner, just to really troll the community. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

This is shown in the LotR Card Game LCG  (the physical one) section of the products in FFG site...

 

EDIT: And that is the only add in the rules section of the product, that still only has the rules until Mumakil

So is the Learn to Play booklet going to be tiny you think?

It might be. Although the indication that this is an online-only book may indicate no significant change to the current in-print rulebook, with this simply serving as the Rules Reference book that is actually printed for other games. I honestly don't know.

For some reason I was thinking this online book was possibly replacing the FAQ, but maybe we'll have the "Learn to Play", the "Rules Reference" and "FAQs"  together.

No, it'll be three separate documents, but I imagine at least some rulings from the FAQ did manage to make their way into the RRG.

This is a hoax everyone! It was all Photoshop!

:o [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_ohmy.png]. How do you know?

I would guess that Felswrath's post was an April Fool's joke (too late?)

## 23 [Wandalf the Gizzard on April 2, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/272462-new-core-box-and-more/?do=findComment&comment=3270613)

If it was a hoax, explain the new RRG on FFG's support page (which comes in the new box along with a "how to play").

## 24 [Felswrath on April 3, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/272462-new-core-box-and-more/?do=findComment&comment=3271421)

Everybody on the FB page is convinced it's a joke at any rate. I think it's the sizes of everything that's not real.

But you can go to the FFG page and download it...

Are you looking at the Cardboard of the Rings facebook page? Because they did a related April Fools joke. But they are not FFG!

This. You said it better than I could have.

Looks like it was that page. It was quoted in Lord of the Rings LCG Players.
