So in watcher in the water, the grasping tentacle gets me with its forced action so i cant stop it and my hero has it attached as a "tentacle attachment"

Seeing as this isnt a condition.. things like miner of the hills cannot get rid of it.

So seeing as WP isnt affected, that character just quests.

Then an encounter card (black uruks i think) is revealed and insists i remove an "attachment" from a questing character.. so I cant see any wording there that is stopping me discarding the tentacle...

Am I playing that right? Or is the tentacle stuck for eternity?

You are correct - Black Uruks are the only means of removing those tentacles other than having the character leave play, because unlike most such things, they don't specify that it must be an attachment you control.

Agreed... a very rare instance where an enemy becomes your friend... if only very temporarily! Don't look this gift horse in the mouth!Â  :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]
