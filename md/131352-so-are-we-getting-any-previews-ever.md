This is getting mildly annoying. The last actual news article was published in the 3rd of November. It's been more than 2 months. I will not talk about other LCG's since they seem to be completely out of sync with ours (SW just got their new expansion while we'll get ours presumably late March), but seriously, is there anything that the designers can preview at this point? It seems like this is the "dry season" for LOTR LCG, and I understand they don't want to prevew stuff too much ahead of time, but we already got our announcements. Is a little preview too much to ask?

I hope the next cycle's previews start to show up soon. The Treason of Saruman and The Lost Realm are both "at the printers", so I would expect to see more about the cycle before TLR is "on the boat".

Last year i were always waiting for new previews or spoilers as i call them as most of you. But now actually not since when i got the last three shadow cycle packs, i didn't know almost anything of those packs and the feeling of seeing new heroes, player -and encounter cards were much better, than opening new pack knowing all cards inside of it.

To each of it's own. While you can simply don't watch the spoilers to prevent this  lack of opening new pack experience, we, the people who eager to see new previews, cannot unwrap news that do not exist.

Agree. If you don't want spoilers, don't look at them. Assuming these expansions come in March, I'll not be having them in my hands until al least early May, so any kind of preview article by the designers is very welcome for my part.

Twice in 2014 we saw a product remain "On the Boat" for two months. I really wouldn't plan on seeing any product on the shelves until June.

Ah yes, I forgot that the arrival schedule for products is as reliable as difficulty ratings for quests. It seems it'll be July or even August for me then...

Does anybody know why they are so wrong most of the time???

1) they are very subjective, so they'll never be consistent anyway.

2) our own ratings are largely based off of comparison to other quests, and in the cases of the earlier quests, they didn't know about the quests that would be coming afterward, so they couldn't compare the difficulty ratings.

3) as the card pool grows, every quest gets easier, so our perception of the first cycle's difficulty is skewed compared to what it was when the quests came out.

4) some quests can be extremely easy if you tailor your deck for it and extremely difficult if you don't.

5) for practically all quests, the difficulty changes dramatically for different numbers of players, so a single difficulty rating can't account for all 4 variations in player numbers.

Because to rate something with something as precise as a number in this matters is a giant failure, as the expereince will hugely vary with the number of players and the deck constitution. They should've taken "rough" approach: easy/normal/hard.

I'm relatively new to the game...in the last couple of years roughly how many deluxe expansions/adv packs come out in a year? Is the goal a new exp or ap each month? Or is it less than that?

## 15 [Bullroarer Took on January 13, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/131352-so-are-we-getting-any-previews-ever/?do=findComment&comment=1403941)

For the past few years we've received one deluxe expansion, six chapter packs based on that deluxe expansion, one saga expansion and one PoD pack.

> I'm relatively new to the game...in the last couple of years roughly how many deluxe expansions/adv packs come out in a year? Is the goal a new exp or ap each month? Or is it less than that?

The goal is a new pack each month but it usually turns out that we get 1 Deluxe box, 6 Adventure Packs, 1 Saga box and a print on demand GenCon quest each year which is about 9 new products each year (excluding Nightmare packs).

Thanks for the replies... Maybe this year we'll luck our way into 2 saga expansions with ToS (hopefully) coming early in the year.

One other question...how does this compare to other LCG release schedules?

Maybe they put too much attention on nightmare decks in the second half of 2014, I hope they can focus on the deluxe, saga and AP.

Theme and stories are more important than strength of encounter decks.

I know somebody that disagrees with that and then secondly, strong encounter decks can go with theme and stories or visa versa, it's not one or the other, but I see your point. Then again, I don't think that they were putting more attention to the nightmare decks, as for this game, the new AP's etc. (everything) has already been planned way ahead.

Wow still nothing, for some reason I thought they'd whip together an article with some spoilers for the first AP of Angmar Awakened or even just more spoilers for Treason of Isengard OR The Lost Realm just to increase morale and breathe some new life into the forums.

Don't despair!

 

Wastes of Eriador is scheduled for delivery in the second quarter of 2015 and Escape from Mount Gram is scheduled for release "early in the second quarter" of 2015.  So I think we'll get them both in the next two weeks!

There are many joke possibilities about ffg shipments but this is very original (though not many will get it, maybe not even a majority here on the boards). Very funny.

And yeah, it usually makes me sick thinking about all the pollution these huge ships make. The fact they are slower than pain makes it even worse.

Two months on the boat, we could get a preview or two. There are dozens of other games (and usually two or three per game for some) before we get one for LotR lcg, these days. What I really miss are those before (not after) release articles. At the time of Dwarrodelf, we would get like three or four each week before the release of an adventure pack. Those were exciting times. Bring back the Preview Monday!

Is it me, or does it always seem like the LotR LCG is always stuck with slower boats compared to the other LCGs in the FFG lineup? Needless to say, the wait is killing me... @_@

I am not sure. There is one question I would like to ask though. In the past, I think I remember I heard that they produce all six packs in the cycle at the same time but from what I observe it does not seem to be the case. Maybe the card design is one process but then the packs get printed in a sequence, not simultaneously. Wouldn't it be advantageous to really do it this way though? Once the design for the cycle is finished, to print all six packs, have them shipped (though in fact it would really be better to print them in the States and avoid the stupid shipping), and release them in given intervals?

I see what you're after there, Fingolfin.... you don't want to have to cross the sea to obtain your treasure, like your half-brother Feanor, in a crazy First Age-style Operation CWAL [http://starcraft.wikia.com/wiki/Operation_CWAL].

Haha.

 

Those passages, by the way, are what makes Silmarillion so great, in my opinion. The sheer determination. The doom, the tragedy, and sometimes, the redemption. No wonder these early works (written first, though not published) were of such style, around the time of the both World Wars. It was only later that Tolkien inclined toward a bit more optimistic work.

Its a shame, as a newbie this year, this seems the quietest ive seen the forum.

After I started we seemed to get a great flow of anouncements and teasers for upcoming stuff, which kept chat on the forum flowing.

At the moment things do seem slower.

With new stuff or teasers, folks chat around those and also visit more and thus post too on the smaller issue threads.

Do we usually get a quiet spot like this inbetween teaser and product?

What usually happens after AP6 hits the shelves do we get instand teasers for the next cycle or do we go into a bit of a quiet spell for some time??

Judging by the speed of FFG's boat, the 6th AP probably won't get here 'til February ( :lol: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_laugh.png]) so we'll probably have at least the new Saga and the new Deluxe teased quite a bit.

Lol

Its not a boat, its a big log paddled by Gollum..

I just hope ffg manage to retain momentum between releases-teasers-new announcements so that there is always SOMETHING keeping us all chatting and thus the momentum of the game up.

Any brand new players need to enter the forum with that chatter of excitement and discussion to inspire and fuel them (it did me and i bought everything). Quiet forum doesnt inspire new players... and nothing keeps the forum buzzing more than new product or teasers or announcements of the next cycle development etc (basically new stuff to speculate at snd proof of the continued support of the game).

C'mon ffg marketing dudes, keep hold of your captive audience for this excellent product!!

Also, it's not uncommon to have an information low point around the end of cycle announcement, then interested is boosted up by the actual release of the firsts APs and most above all, the announcements made at GenCon.

 

We experienced last year the same june-may low point and the had The Dunland Trap, Three Trials, Trouble in Tharbad at GenCon (and the Old Forest too -- and what a quest) as well as announcement for The Lost Realm and Treason of Saruman.

The cycle of quiet and flurry is nothing new and will probably continue into the future. Basically we get deluxe (often near the same time as a Saga), which causes a lot of chatter, then a long dry spell until the first AP. Then, the AP's usually come quickly, one right after the other. Then, another delay/quiet period between 6th AP and next deluxe.

 

I'm not too worried about Mount Gram. Once Waste hits, we'll probably see a speedup like usual.

Every other LCG has approximately twice the number of player cards per pack than LOTR. I don't really want that many encounter cards to be spoiled.

It doesn't take a cynic to know how feeble this attempt is. I do not think it needs further pointing out, unless one just enjoys repeating the obvious all the time.

On the other hand, it has been proven over and over that the designers do read these forums, just as they address personal mail. I myself had two of my concerns covered in an article. Furthermore, much of the errata comes directly as consequence to the decks posted here. I do not think the designers themselves try to create loops with their own cards. As I really dislike some of the errata (Horn of Gondor, for instance), it feels like something good could actually come off the rant.

Still, it could be much earlier than last years. I remember in 2013 the first pack came in mid-May or so, 2014 was mid-June, and I cannot recall last year but the announcement of the last pack came mid-July. I believe this time we could get the first pack still in April perhaps?

They write it when they are told to. What I meant is that it's not up to them when and what to write/spoil.

Star Wars Armada is not a Living Card Game to my knowledge. And, if it's a board game that had no info about any new stuff in about a year - then it's probably discontinued.

GoT: 9,503 topics and 71,707 replies.     Average 7.5 replies per thread.

LotR: 7,084 topics and 82,171 replies.    Average 11.6 replies per thread.

 

I'd say we just manage to keep threads going for longer.  I'd suspect a lot of GoT's posts are "How do this work/Can I do this/Did I just break the game... etc" with a reply explaining the rule and - if the second person is lucky - a "thanks" reply.   LotR tends to have more in depth conversations about the theme and what not as well as deck building, etc.  Since GoT is competitive, there isn't much shared collaborative deck building going on like there is here.

 

Also, the forums at Cardgamedb are a LOT more active for GoT (at least back when I was playing 1e GoT it was. I don't follow 2e.) while the LotR forum section is mostly dead with few exceptions.

 

 

And for the record - I'd sign that petition as well.

Having your forums, a deck builder and individual card discussions all in one place (for every LCG FFG has) is pretty nice.   Only reason I showed up on these forums is because Psychorocka mentioned they were way more active than the mostly dead cardgamedb LotR forums (so it's his fault I'm here).

Armada is an FFG minitures game along the lines of Xwing, so it has regular 'Waves' of new ships, much like a cycle in lotr lcg. The game is newish, apparently selling well and very much alive, but we've had no new content announcements since April last year. No it's not an LCG as you rightly say, but it is a living game that evolves with each wave of ships released, in much the same way, including controversial errata etc. I play both games, so I was just pointing out that a few weeks silence is nothing compared to Armada!!!

I'm sad for your Armada, but we're kinda discussing card games here. I could fetch you any discontinued game from FFG's limitless supply and act happy that LotR LCG is not, but that's kinda not the case here.

Armada's not discontinued, just slow.  FFG recently announced the summer OP kit for it, and when I looked earlier this year at what FFG products were actually being sold most by OLGS (for a thread on BGG), it was very high in the list.

 

While it's not a card game, there's obviously a lot of commonality between Living Card Games and Living Miniature Games.  Our card game is certainly going to be easier to manufacture, but there's no reason to suppose Armada fans would be any happier with lack of news than we are.

Still being sold and discontinued are not controversial, CoC LCG is discontinued, but is still sold.

 

Regardless, I find it inapropriate to bring up game of a different genre here just because it has similar release problem. Maybe topic like that should be taken to this game's forum.

I'm not sure what continuing to sell CoC (poorly, IIRC) has to do with Armada at all.  CoC had its end of life announced and an end to organized play.  Armada hasn't had end of life announced, has upcoming organized play, and seemed to be selling very well.

 

Nor do I find it inappropriate to bring up a game of "another genre" here, given that the game is:

 

1) Published by the very same publisher

2) Is designed to be expanded in an analogous manner to the LCG line.

 

While there are differences between miniatures games and card games in general, with respect to the announcement and delivery of new content LCG is very much in the same family with FFG's miniature games, and not with conventional card games.  The differences in gameplay simply aren't relevant to the discussion we're having about the timeliness of previews.  The difference in delivery timing is more relevant (all-at-once waves versus spread-out cycles), though even there the saga expansions directly correspond to the waves in terms of timing.

 

I for one am interested, while waiting to hear something about Flame of the West, to know that some other FFG community is getting even less in the way of spoilers.

Surely we are now long overdue for both a news article and for Flight of the Stormcaller to be changed to Shipping now....

its last update was on the 28th of Jan... it is almost the 28th of March now so has been almost 8 weeks.... so much for 4 -6... 

I really wish this game got as much love and regular updates from FFG as AGOT and Netrunner....

Oh I have tried it alright. Get excited, it is that good.

On another note, preview tonight surely. The Flame is being announced with a great hero spoil (plus two or three other great cards) and the state of the Stormcrawled shifts into the shipping state and in about a week we have the spoilers. Call me an idealist?

There's still a week before the month is over. Panic then.

There is no need to panic. There is a lot of materials for the game planned.

 

I think Matt and Caleb should have some difficulties with the creation of the scenarios of The Flame of The West.

There is a lot of events in The return of The King (they can create at least 7 or 8 scenarios till the end) , and it should be hard balance difficulty (especially with the Boons Burdens fot the lasts scenarios).

 

Nonetheless, i don't understand why we had a giant new (Nightmare of the end of ring maker + Nightmare of The Road Darkens) instead of 2 little news with a gap of 2 or 3 weeks. I prefer to have more regular news, even with less contents.

No, sving him to the last hero in the game!

 

And he is going to have high threat + lots of threat raising effects + good with palantir + abilities to fight the encounter deck openly on a whole new level. Playing with top card faceup seems theamatic.

Something interesting from one of the recent AGOT2 spoilers mechanic-wise. It cancels an effect based on a single world contained within that effect's text. Do you think something like that can be used for softer cancel effects of LotR?

Quite possibly, but it's so conditional. I'm trying to think of an encounter card effect that I hate enough to run a cancel like that. Dunedain Watcher is a similar card except she is a hard shadow cancel on a stick, and four cycles later we still haven't seen her sibling which would hard cancel a treachery.

Free To Choose is similar in that it is keyed off of a threat raise.

Free to Choose isn't a cancel though and is more keyed off an effect rather than a particular word.   Minas Tirith Lampwright is a decent example since triggers off of the word "surge" and discards themselves, except it is worse since there is a chance it doesn't cancel the surge effect (if you guess wrong).

 

I'm not sure what else - outside of actual keywords like surge and doom - that we'd want to target enough that we'd actually include them in.   

 

"discard" "exhaust" "raise" "reveal" "seach" "engaged"

 

Just some ideas of common words used in treacheries.   Not sure I'd like to see anything that was word specific like that.

A card that discards to let you cancel an encounter card with the phrase "search the encounter deck" would be fantastic. They would have to avoid giving such a character the Rohan trait, otherwise Gamling shenanigans would ensue.

It has been over 8 weeks at this point.

It is meant to take 6 weeks tops on the boat and roughly 2 weeks "shipping now"

so yeah we should legit already have this pack in our hands at this point....

 

it hasn't been updated since the 28th of Jan, well over 2 months now.....

Also I've been checking the news page on a daily basis and that second game of thrones update was 100% not there until JUST NOW yet the Descent 2nd edition news was there far beforehand....

So not only are we seeing previews for everything else first but it seems AGOT even gets magical time traveling news as well :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

So they just threw four Nightmare Decks at once and have been silent with any other Lotr  news for quiet a long time :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

At least we know two upcoming heroes . Let's hope we will get a chance to see two other leadership heroes soon.

Would be nice to see a leadership dwarf, or a leadership Rohirrim ^^

Please, don't do this. Yes, there are children starving in Africa. But it has absolutely nothing to do with the matter at hand. People love this game and eager to see some news, yet no news for really long time, this is a legit concern to be discussed on this appropriate forums, no bigger tragedy can change this fact.

I love this game but honestly, if they just announced that the game got discontinued right now, I wouldn't morn much. There are plenty of cards/quests for me to enjoy this game for a long time.

And we know that the game isn't discontinued. I'm certain they will at least finish this cycle, so why be concerned? Just enjoy the down time and donate the money you would have so spent this month on the game to a starving child in Africa or something.

This is not the place for this sort of stuff..... I am 100% with John here this is not the time or place to speak of such things regardless of how serious they may be. 

This is the forum for this specific game and people who love this game (many of which are huge tolkien fans as well) are interested in seeing some news/spoilers which are long long overdue and so we are restless and eager for news.....

how dare we right? 

 

I personally would be gutted and most definitely would care if they announced that the game is ending after this cycle and the last two saga boxes....

there is definitely more than enough material, support and interest for them to do at least one more cycle and hopefully much more. There is so much more they could potentially do and I think many others are in the same boat as me and want this game to last as long as possible. If you don't care that much thats fine but some of us do so please don't trivialise our love for this game.

Just a bit of information to soften all the "we are not getting any spoilers compared to other games". 4 adventure packs have had a news and we've already had 24 spoilers or image glimpses of player cards, which is already a third of the player cards for next cycle, with 2 more announcement news for the last APs :-)

While we STILL wait for spoilers or news...... -_- [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sleep.png]

I hope we get a unique ally version of Halbarad in this cycle...

Also Elrohir and Elladan allies or heroes...

An ally version of Cirdan would be nice but perhaps it is too soon for that..

Still hoping we see Thranduil at last as well, that would be fantastic, it would be cool if there was a slightly different silvan mechanic that appears on the elves of Mirkwood as opposed to the bouncing in and out of play strategy of the Lorien silvans.
We know we are getting more support for existing traits and I am curious to see how each trait is bolstered... Silvan's got a nice healer recently, the new dwarf allies are pretty **** powerful (sellsword and azain) and Dunedain got Eldahir and hobbits get ally Sam and Robin Smallburrow. What else will we see? Some more Gondor and Rohan support? More Dale support on top of Lanwyn? More Valour cards?

 

I really want to see what the tactics event Last Stand that features Hama does and really want to see what the other tactics event Revealed in Wrath does as well... I'm hoping Revealed in Wrath is one of those cards that allows any player to pay resources of another sphere to activate another effect... seems like it might be a really good card for Noldor decks as it seemingly features Glorfindel. I wonder if it does direct damage or if it boosts a character or what....

i've been using the Marksman of Lorien for a while now and it is amazingly... such great value for its cost...

the 2 hitpoints is amazing, the bonus when it enters play is great and the 3 base attack AND ranged is fantastic.

In proper silvan decks with O Lorien and Celeborn it will have even more value!

I wonder what other cards we will see that boost 2 hero decks... I wonder what else they can do (other than bonus resources or stats or readying effects) that will actually achieve this other than secrecy cards..? Will be interesting to see what they do!

Arrows from the Trees and Interrogation both look really interesting as well and perhaps Arrows will be a direct damage card?

Interrogation could be any manner of things and maybe it even allows you to manipulate an enemy to look at or even reorder the top few cards of the encounter deck? I wonder if we will see other new traps on top of Entangling Nets which is an amazing card, 1 cost for -2 attack AND -2 defence? makes the enemy both easier to defend against and easier to destroy not to mention various other combos you can pull off like Straight Shot etc.

 

Finally behind the new Lanwyn hero and behind Eldahir and what I assume is Captain's Wisdom there appears to be a new ally that is some sort of muscly person with a glove and what appears to me to be a hammer or smithing tool. Looks like we will get another smith type ally, can't tell if its a man or dwarf or even elf from just that arm or even what sphere the card is but I am still very curious as to what this ally might do.

What I'm most curious about is the Gondor support we're getting this cycle. I pray to all the Valar that we get a lowish threat Leadership Gondor hero with a nice ability and decent willpower. That would boost the trait quite a bit, as well as some kind of way to draw cards (Captain's Wisdom hopefully?). I really want Leadership Gondor to be actually top tier.

Still no news, but already a lot cards are spoiled!! We have informations on 25 cards, with still 2 AP to be spoiled.

An AP cycle contains 60 differents players cards (6 heroes and 54 differents players cards for deck), so we already have 41% of the cards spoiled (or at least with illustration and some text). :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]  With 2 more news, we will have more than 50% of the cards of the cycle partially spoiled.

 

It very impressive for the spirit sphere. For instance, i think we already have all the informations about the spirit allies of the StormCaller cycle now.

 

We have 4 spirit allies spoiled.

 

* Glorfindel

* Sam Gamgee

Rhovanian-outrider

Woodland Courier

 

In Angmar Awakened -->4 spirits allies

In The Ring Maker --> 4 spirit allies

In Against the Shadow --> 5 spirit allies

In Dwarrowdelf --> 4 spirit allies

The only exception is Hunt For Gollum with 6 spirit allies, but it was the begining of the game, not sure it's relevant.

Does anyone care for the Fate of Numenor quest? I thought it was super bland and boring. I just started playing Grey Havens, took a couple months off for AGOT 2.0 and can't say I'm too impressed. I own all the NM and Gencon packs and am starting to feel like there's enough content out there for me. I'll probably try the first chapter pack but I think my time with continuing this game is over. I have tons of pleasure with all the content I own.

I enjoyed all 3 of the quests from the box.  I actually liked the island exploring the most due to it being an actual new mechanic with the double sided locations.   The first quest (sailing) is just a hide test before every quest phase and the last quest (aflame) is a different take on the burning keyword from the Battle at Lake Town.   I did enjoy those still, but the middle quest was my favorite.

Fate of Numenor is quickly becoming one of my all-time favorites.

## 219 [PsychoRocka on April 5, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/131352-so-are-we-getting-any-previews-ever/?do=findComment&comment=2150664)

I really enjoy Fate of Numenor as well and it is probably my favourite in the box with Raid on the Grey Havens in a close second.
Not a fan of Sailing thus far and it really sort of is just a more complicated version of hide tests or escape tests. It can also be insanely luck based and you might get no symbols on like 5 cards or like 3 symbols on just 2 cards which I really don't like... 

I love the lost island mechanic and double sided locations.

I like that location threat is fairly static or at least fairly easy to predict in this quest. Yes there may be several lost islands but you know until you travel to them they are all 2 threat (or 3 if that certain treachery appears!) and you know they will only increase if you get to stage 2 or get that treachery that adds an extra one to staging.

They replace each other when you travel but do not appear otherwise again except for that one treachery or stage 2's effect.

I find this stops location lock and makes it way easier to deal with locations in general.

 

I actually sort of wish every quest was designed like this with a separate deck for locations and a new one only gets added to staging once you travel to a location already in play. Double sided locations is awesome too but I don't think they should be like that for every quest, just certain ones. 

All that being said it is an extremely easy quest (for my decks at least) and I haven't lost a game against it yet.

I've lost more than one attempt at both other quests in the box so for me it is definitely the easiest.

 

Honestly after Carn Dum and Dread Realm I think I prefer easier quests now though.... its just more fun to see your deck work properly and to have several smaller exciting moments that you have to overcome than seeing your deck get slowly decimated and barely hanging on all game and being ready to restart everything at any possible moment every turn.

I'm just not interested in restarting several times in a row on turn 2 or 3 with a game that requires as much space and setup as this one does, especially playing two handed...
 

I suspect that this might be why people don't like this quest though? It really has very little teeth and is pretty **** easy to beat (I find that the Throngs of Unfaithful are perhaps one of the worst cards just because they almost never go away) and I know most people don't enjoy overly easy quests.

My first experience with the quest was a mono-tactics deck and a version of my Rapid Fire Gandalf enabler deck. I had so little questing the tactics player had to commit each round also (with Unexpected Courage so it wasn't too bad) and a few turns we only got progress because of Hands upon the Bow!   It was definitely a very challenging quest with this setup - mainly because I hadn't included any allies in the Gandalf deck yet, so max WP was 10 from my side.   It was definitely a lot harder than it should have been.   I've played it several times since then with various decks and it is definitely the easiest of the three.  Especially if someone is running staging area location control - such as the new lore event.    But I still love the mechanics of it a lot more than the other two.

I would love some strategy articles for our game in regards to the upcoming cycle or the Noldor archetype, doesn't necessarily have to have spoilers. I mean I would obviously MUCH prefer some spoilers but yeah even strategy articles would be fantastic....

 

They could even do second breakfast articles where they don't actually spoil any player cards or even encounter cards but just talk about the new mechanics and threats we will face and how they came to design it that way....

They actually do, just not through the FFG news. Last week there were ton of non-stop spoilers for the Wolves of the North box, which ended up with all the remaining unspoiled cards getting spoiled by an espanol guy at the end of the week (presumably because he already has the box in his possession).

I agree with you John. There's definitely an issue with one of these things you've mentioned above today. We are a bunch of lads who love this game not only for it's Tolkien's flavour but also because it's mechanically sound and we have a great fun during a play. Anyways unfortunately we have to devote a lot of money to this game which makes us not only players but also customers. Exactly - customers. That's why in my personal estimation FFG should let us know what is going on and why is there such a huge delay in delivery as well as in providing us any news on the forum. Each company knows that selling and providing something to the customers is one thing but having good customer care service is another and it can be sometimes more important than selling any product itself.

Someone else thinks they maybe try to chage sailing and/or ship enemies? We obviously only have 1 quest to feature sailing, but it seemed to have some flaws.

The big Problem for me is, that the best way to Play the sailing quest is to ignore every ship enemie. Keeping threat below their Engagement cost and staying at the best heading allows to fully Focus on questing and ignore combat.

 

I don't think Things will stay this way (FFG should have seen after 2 test Plays that you can just quest through the first quest) as the next 2 quest look like we have to fight enemies on ships to win, but the remaining quests might not have "forced" ship combat and FFG could try Change that.

Don't they design all quests before finishing the deluxe though? Anyway, that first sailing quest may not be in the greatest ever, but it's a perfectly fine and playable quest. A dedicated questing deck should be able to win without engaging occasionally, and I doubt you'll be able to avoid all combat consistently (i.e. in a majority of playthroughs).

## 256 [Calvadur on April 10, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/131352-so-are-we-getting-any-previews-ever/?do=findComment&comment=2159877)

I played the quest 4 times (3x solo 1x duo) and every time it was no problem to avoid the ships. The decks were made for that with starting threats 5-10 points below engagement cost. A little threat reduction and you are good to go, as the quest takes 4-6 rounds to finish. Coming from lost realm/angmar awakend/land of shadow it is such a hard change of power. Everything engagement cost over 30, no real punishment for leaving enemies in the staging area...

 

I agree the quest is perfectly playable, but it is on the easier side as, in my opinion, the complete box, what is not bad, as especially new Players don't need much to hold their ground. I just have the fear that ship enemies will stay this way: Keep them in the staging area, better quest hard than fight, when no effects force you to engage them.

No game previews may be forthcoming, but I did find this short piece from NPR about Tolkein's only-recently-published translation of a Finnish epic, Story of Kullervo: http://www.npr.org/2016/04/10/471619609/frodo-bilbo-kullervo-tolkiens-finnish-adventure [http://www.npr.org/2016/04/10/471619609/frodo-bilbo-kullervo-tolkiens-finnish-adventure]. Apparently (new to me, anyway), this Finnish hero Kullervo was the inspiration for Turin Turambar of the First Age.

My guess is that they discovered a printing problem with Flight of the Stormcaller - maybe some of the cards got the wrong backs, or some of the cards were missing crucial text - and they worked with the printer to get the pack re-printed. In the meantime, given the delay of the first pack in the cycle, they've put a freeze on the rest of the cycle, including preview articles.

Same with nightmare. Same with announcing the next cycle. 

Also a delay like this wouldn't stop them from doing a second breakfast where they just give us a taster of the quest and what the mechanics might be based on or similar to. It doesn't have to be a week out that they release second breakfast... they can do it whenever and it isn't really time sensitive as they never spoil actual cards in second breakfast and when they do its like one or two cards tops and encounter cards not player ones.

FFG does have a tendency to make some bad decisions. Like cancelling Battlelore for example, (but not telling anyone that they cancelled it). I hate their inane secrecy. I should become a playtester for every game just so that I don't have to deal with the secrecy. My guess is that there will be one more cycle after this, and the final Saga will be released at Gencon 2017, followed by the final packs in cycle 7 to end the game around Worlds 2017. Then we get to work on the legacy project. I've got quite a few plans already for organizing it.

 

 

And then, my Runebound LCG I have been designing forever will get accepted by LCG and published! :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

I wonder about what the story is gonna be, and what Harad friends we're gonna get. I think it's obvious the heroes will meet and befriend one or several Haradrim at one point, plus there's also that art of a Harad dude helping a Gondorian out of a burning building. A Harad hero or two are to be expected IMO. Oh, and Kahliel looks darn cool.

I have no illusions about being original.

I think there quite a few people who think they are funny… and quite a few who find them not so. But that is people and life, so it is basically useless to mention.

It is useful for me, as I had an increasingly growing itch every time someone made that joke.

To each his own. Some people feel that way about Gandalf jokes. Others feel the same about never ending wishes for magic rings or artifacts. And some don't believe that discussions about custom made cards are at all interesting. Or that there is any need what so ever for starting an argument over these things...

Exactly, or the ever common one-liners that mean very little. If everyone would itch to scorn at them this place would be much worse.

You gotta give me some credit, I kept it sealed until now for a pretty long time. But every patience has it's end.

 

Regardless, I just thought that "Wizard is Never Late" is a cool name concept for an Istari event or something.

Actually it would be a terrible name, because this game is not based on the movies, but on the novels, says right in the box.

I don't know if these cards have been spoiled or not but while looking for what gaps I needed to fill that FFG doesn't sell directly, I noticed FFG has posted an announcement of the Adventure Pack for the fourth Haradrim cycle on the main page.

I don't really mind the printing delays, it's the lack of news that baffles me. It's been Runewars minis and AGOT LCG non-stop for the last month and couple weeks. How hard is it to write something up, even if to just spoil a couple cards? And I fully expect next article will be a preview for Race a la Off the Beaten Path "spoiling" cards we've already seen.

One of the spoiled cards has a glaring error so it may be just that. I'm assuming the best.

I presume the "glaring error" is that the settler is actually useful instead of being useless like the other woodmen?

Eryn Galen Settler reads "in the staging" in its ability instead of "in the staging area".

It is the responsibility of the individual to confront the absurd and craft meaning for oneself, to fight phenomenological futility of existence by self-manufacturing purpose. 

I think that, in our case, this means actively playing the game in new and refreshing ways while we wait.     :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
