Apparently somehow we got Crossings of Poros spoilers before Black Serpent... weird, but I'll take it. This is probably already my favorite pack of the cycle, and those who've read my posts anticipating certain themes will instantly recognize why. So without further adue and needless to say SPOILERS AHEAD

Quickbeam will go well coupled with Lore (Self-Preservation, Wellinghall Preserver).  I like readying best on a defender, though, and with only 1 defense and no restricted attachments I don't think he'd do well there.

Beorning Guardian's discarding effect wouldn't be used often, but 3 attack for 3 resources makes him playable, and he can absorb some damage.

Bulwark of the West is an immediate sideboard card for any Leadership deck in a Condition quest.  Love it.

Halfast Gamgee is 2 willpower in leadership for net-2 resources without completed side-quests and only gets cheaper, and there's no restriction on where the rebate resource goes.  It's great to see a named hobbit who is only referenced and not met in the book.

The Dam Bursts is very narrow and probably only fits in a red/green ent deck.  It's a pity it doesn't ready *all* damaged ents instead of just ones you control.

Magic Ring is very powerful and thematic, though at 1-per-deck it'll be hard to plan around it.  It'll look good on Lore Aragorn.

Hall of Beorn shows Flight to the Sea/Wind from the Sea for spirit, our second encounter-deck-adding card.  At least this time the added card has a beneficial shadow.

It also has Emyn Arnen Ranger (lore trap lover), and Followed (tactics trap).

Quickbeam – Non-unique Tactics Hero

Beorning Guardian – Tactics ally

Followed – Tactics attachment

Halfast Gamgee – Leadership ally  (He’s not Halfast at all!)

Bulwark of the West – Leadership event

Emyn Arnen Ranger – Lore ally

The Dam Bursts – Lore event

Flight to the Sea – Spirit event

Wind from the Sea – Event/encounter card result of Flight to the Sea

Magic Ring – Neutral attachment

 

I think that's all.

I feel like the non - unique on Quickbeam has to be an oversight. I can't imagine any reason to make any hero non - unique,  let alone that one.

But I do like the hero quite a lot.  First hero with a native 4 attack, if I remember right.

And the other cards are pure gold.

I'm glad Magic Ring is both only one per deck and also not unique because it's certainly going to be an auto include in a lot of decks but it ought to still feel special.

Magic ring is really good. I will also make proxies so I can play with it right now. Halfast Gamgee seem to be a playable card, but not a stapple. Quickbeam will be errated to be unique soon I guess. He is interesting in an ent deck but not really outside of that.

## 19 [Kjeld on July 12, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/253912-crossings-of-poros-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=2876200)

It would be a lot of fun to play a Quickbeam + Beorn smash deck. Together, they're almost powerful enough to take on and defeat a Hill Troll first turn with no other cards or hero actions. With a Boomed and Trumpeted in hand, they would succeed.

The non-unique Quickbeam is an error or an joke?

## 21 [soullos on July 12, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/253912-crossings-of-poros-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=2876291)

Quickbeam must've been an error. I wonder if FFG is reprinting the whole AP to fix this glaring error and this pack somehow just got out of the wild. It would explain why the release schedule has been sooooo slow lately and that Crossings of Poros has been stuck "in development" on the upcoming page for so long now. (Hell, while we've been in the Harad cycle, AH LCG released their Core set, an entire cycle and will start a new one, and we're only just now halfway. Crazy! @_@.) I wouldn't mind waiting for a fixed version, but the novelty of a non-unique hero is kind of great. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

I wonder if the reason for the delay in releasing The Black Serpent is that they accidentally switched it with Crossings of Poros?

Seems like a decent pack. The Dam Breaks is pretty cool, makes me want to build an Ent deck again, maybe with Quickbeam hero at the helm. 

Magic Ring is nice, it will see play.

Most of these cards are solid cards, but they don't really inspire me to run out and build a new deck. I mostly just want to slot them into my existing decks.

Like the cards, especially Quickbeam and the ring. Seems a nice pack for player cards

## 24 [John Constantine on July 12, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/253912-crossings-of-poros-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=2876523)

Why the hype behind the ring? Is everybody that willing to sacrifice 1 threat each turn?

1 healing for 1 threat? Prepostrous! Will only be ever used in situations where a hero's life gonna depend on it.

1 resource for 1 threat? Sounds good on paper. In reality, you're paying 2 for this ring, so you're gonna have to wait 3 turns for it to bring you net profit, and that would be only in terms of resources, the first two times you'll use it to gain a resouece, you'll be making up for it cost and raising your threat by 1 each time you do so. In short the term of 3 turns, it's gonna look like "pay 2 resources and raise your threat by 3 to wait 3 turnd and gain 1 resource". Looks very slow for a game that blows you out with ten 9 attack enemies on turn 1.

Readying for 1 threat is the most decent thing this ring has, but in the current pool with so many readying stuff around, it's really hard to justify for me personally.

 

I'm not saying it is completely horrible, it has diverse potential, I just don't see why it gets "oh my god this is going into every deck ever" kind of hype. It's 1 per deck. There will be games you won't even draw it.

The ring has many things going for it.

1. It's neutral, so a first turn play is easily possible or you can use stacked up ressources, because you can out of a specifics sphere cards. Following that you can use it to play a 2cost card of an specific sphere every turn while playing a three sphere deck. It provides an unconditional readying effect for any sphere, too.
2. As hinted in point one the ring provides a good amount of versitality.
3. 1 threat really isn't the world. Even Boromir decks work most of the time without going all out on threat reduction.

 

But I see your point and I think there are some "archetype" situation where the ring is better or worse:

A good situation: You run a three sphere deck and want a 2 cost ally first turn (e.g. Arwen) done.
A worse situation: You play e.g. a Caldara deck (=mono sphere) and play the ring. If you don't need the readying playing something else probably would have been better.


TL;DR: Neutral, smoothes ressources, unconditional readying option, but probably should have an instant effect to be worth it.

 

Note I don't garantee that the stuff I wrote up, without playing with the ring, does work out as I imagine, but I think that are points many people see in the ring and should explain why we are so hyped :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]
The one per deck rule limits the consistency, especially of a first turn draw, but you probably aren't sad about drawing it later in the game (= It's not bad if you DON'T get it first turn)

Another minor point, but it's the first instance of healing outside of lore other than the Remedy. It's not that great if you are primarily using it that way, but at least it's an option.

I think the hype comes from beeing able to splash it into any kind of deck, thus adding e.g. healing to a non-lore deck, etc.

Honestly, if I would need healing all that much, I'd build a deck that has lore rather than rely on one 2-cost card in a deck that allows me to heal 1 damage for 1 threat per turn.

## 29 [Flrbb on July 12, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/253912-crossings-of-poros-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=2877063)

Why do Quickbeam has to get 2 damage? Shouldn't 1 be enough? :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Besides, why the cards say (C) 2016?

The availability of so many diverse effects on one neutral card is pretty neat. Keep in mind you're paying for all of these things, not just any one. For instance, the healing isn't a great deal, but if you brought it along for the readying, you might find a situation where one point of healing makes the difference on the survival of a hero. 

I don't think it's busted good, but I think it fits in a lot of decks. The amount of flexibility is impressive.

I don't always need to ready.  I don't always need one measly point of healing.  I don't always need an extra resource.

But if I do, I'm usually willing to pay 1 threat for it.

This is going in all my decks ever because it's my favorite card to come out of FFG in ages. For years I predicted, wished, BEGGED for the exploration of the  Artifact trait and particularly the themes of magic or lesser rings. There were people who disagreed with me and said we would never get these magical artifacts or these "darker" themes. They were at least partially wrong, because we did get a Lesser Ring, and like the Beorning it might be a hint of more Artifacts to come in the next cycle. Thematically speaking, one of these was something I most wanted to see. Not only that, but for the other reasons people listed this card is amazing, if anything to have 1 copy of a piece of Gandalf's Staff (the thing I use it for the most is resource acceleration anyway), emergency healing and readying in neutral. This card is incredible. I love every single part of it. Maybe it won't go in ALL my decks ever as I have like 10 physical decks built at all times, but if I were to buy enough copies of this pack, it probably would.

Now that we have a Lesser Ring and they seem to be more open to explore artifice and corruption, it's all the more likely. I really would love to have Saruman hero as well.

We all want Saruman, but he needs to be unique. I'm working on some (right now 11 in text form) custom Saruman cards (with some very unique abilities), and would be very disappointed if the real cards were less "extreme". 

Nice cards, love the Hero and the ring.

the craziest thing happened today. As i usually do, i pre-ordered the whole haradrim cycle in a local retailer (in Greece).

Today the Crossing of Poros was updated to be "in stock". At first i was sure of it to be a mistake, but it turned out to be true.

 

So I have in my hands the 6th adventure pack that seems to be "in development".

 

There is no logical explanation behind this. (or apparently there is, but we don't know it yet)

THIS POST IS FULL OF SPOILERS, PLEASE DO NOT READ FURTHER UNLESS YOU WANT TO KNOW WHERE WE ARE GOING NEXT!

 

First of all, i think the next cycle is taking place in Dale !

And i quote from the Epilogue's last sentences: (context: Denethor made Kahliel take an oath never to attack Gondor again, then Kahliel is troubled because his folk is now houseless)

 

"Gondor is not the only realm in Middle-Earth. There are others who are not so proud. Perhaps King Brand in Dale will have room for you. His kingdom already has dealings with Elves and Dwarves; your people are closer kin than they", reassured one of the heroes

"Tell me of Dale and King Brand", said Kahliel.

 

The adventure uses the following encounter sets: Crossings of Poros, Mountains of Shadow (also included in this adventure pack), Desert Sands, Desert Creatures, Harad Soldiers and Mordor Orcs.

 

And unfortunately Quickbeam does not have the unique symbol.

 

If there is anything else I can tell you, questions are welcome :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Ultra Spectacular Ruse Nonbo of the Day: ready Quickbeam by dealing 2 damage, then exhaust the magic ring to heal one damage and take one threat...   just ignore the fact that the ring can ready him for 1 threat anyway.  we're going for SYNERGY

i don't know why exactly you were able to get it early, but i can tell you that they print the whole cycle at once and then slowly ship them out.  that's why, when there are delays, they're usually between cycles, but once a cycle starts shipping, there often aren't any delays between each pack

Great news if Antonick is correct!

Dam Bursts will fit nicely in my Treebeard/Merry/Pippin deck Ent and Hobbit themed deck. The fact that Ents enter exhausted really weakens that deck, so this will help.

I also like Bulwark of the West which will fit in my Gondor leadership deck when required.

The Magic Ring isn't a game changer IMO, but it's wonderfully thematic and will slot in all my decks

Pretty funny that a card who have a slot in all your decks is not a "game changer". It will obviously change the way to build decks since this is a solid option in all deck, so threat management should be re-thinking now :).

So, you're gonna magically start building whole decks around a 1-of that does a little bit of this and a little bit of that while raising your threat? Don't make me laugh. And also, a card that goes everywhere, as you say, is not a game changer.

A card that goes everywhere is a staple.  It's neither powerful enough nor common enough to build whole decks around it, but there may be no other card in the entire cycle that will find its way into so many decks.

I'm not sure if that reply was to me, but in all fairness I didn't say that I would start building decks around it - rather it would slot into existing decks. Actually I share some of your scepticism, but I still think it's a fun little card that can be useful. The way I play the game is to create a number of decks that last throughout each cycle* and have a sideboard of staples I can add into each. Currently I'm playing through Nightmare Hunt for Gollum Cycle with:

- Gondor leadership deck

- Dunedain leadership deck

- Noldor deck

- Silvan deck

- Rohirrim deck

- Gondor Outlands deck

- Dwarf deck

- Ent / Hobbits deck

The Magic Ring cards will simply go in my sideboard and then be inserted into one of these decks as I choose.

(*I am occasionally forced to create specialist decks mid way through cycles but try not to if possible)

(**My Gondor leadership deck (Denethor, Boromir, Theodred) absolutely stomped Nightmare Hunt for Gollum on Monday. I was generating 25 willpower by turn 5!)

the magic ring reminds me of cards like Gather Information or Treebeard, which are pretty decent options when deckbuilding and you need some extra "filler" cards to reach 50

I have a hunch that Crossing was mistakenly sent out in place of Black Serpent.  In the US it was probably hastily recalled but in Europe they are being sold.  I normally would have been notified that Black Serpent is available for pickup today.  I'm going to drop in to my store later to pick up the Grey Havens Nightmares so I'll see if they can spill some beans.  Probably we need to wait another week or two for Serpent now.

I doubt it will happen, but it would be nice if this got FFG to stop this "In Development" farce.

Since the ally Quickbeam has a unique symbol, won't he conflict with the same-name Hero?

If ever there was a character to be in two places at once, "Quickbeam" seems a good candidate.

no, you're not taking it far enough.

play 2-, 3-, hell even 4-handed and go Oprah on your decks and include Quickbeam for everyone!

hell, make a mono tactics with 3 Quickbeam heroes--make FOUR mono tactics with 12 Quickbeams!

once you've done that, then you can start considering playing 12-handed Annuminas with 36

Of course, you've always been able to use multiple copies of the same hero, since uniqueness rules only prevent cards entering play if another copy is already in play. Since heroes all enter play simultaneously, you're fine!

In my opinion, the Magic Ring is a nice and thematic addition to the card pool. We don't have to be too radical about it. It is a good card that will find a place in many decks. I can speically think of some of my multi-sphere deck were I will include it to smooth resources when need it or to ready the hero. I have a dwarf deck with Nori that can afford the extra threat, or my Rohan Gondor deck with Spirit Beregon where I will include the ring.

Probably it is not a card you will use every round, but it will be very helpful on those rounds where you need the extra resource or the extra ready effect.

After all is a magic ring! "There are many magic rings in this world, Bilbo Baggings, and none of them should be used lightly"

For someone who has gotten this pack; I'm assuming you just get 1x copy of the Quickbeam hero?

And has anyone sent in a question yet on if this Quickbeam is supposed to be non-unique or not?

I would probably buy 3x of this pack to get 3x Quickbeams just for fun, but I'm not doing that until I know for sure whether they're just gonna errata/fix him though.

Knowing nothing is sure in this world, I would bet that they are 100% going to "errata" Herobeam.
I can't really see how someone could assume they left the symbol out deliberatly. All heroes are unique (makes sense as they all are unique beings in Tolkien's world) and we even have an ally of the same name, who is unique, too.

And you really don't need 3 packs or to care about errata to have fun with this game. Use proxies or whatever. If you have fun playing 3 copies of a hero just do it, FFG can't and wouldn't stop you. This is a game for personal enjoyment, not professional high stakes poker.

If I've learned anything in 24 years of playing card games, it's that no card game rule is set in stone. FFG could easily make a non-unique hero. It'd be kind of fun even. I personally think this Quickbeam thing was just a mistake, but then again maybe it's not. If it was deliberate you'd also think they'd give us the full 3x copies. That's why I was asking.

But if it was deliberate, and for some reason there was only 1x Quickbeam included, I would totally buy 2x more of the pack. I like having the official cards, for my personal enjoyment.

There's just 1 copy of the Quickbeam hero in the pack, same as always. So like everyone else, I'm sure it's an oversight. And the worst one to date come to think of it.

I could certainly see FFG releasing a non-unique hero some day, but Quickbeam is definitely not the one to do it with. He's an actual named character from the books. I'm sure the lack of a unique symbol was an oversight.

Mostly this, but FFG also gave us "BORN Aloft" and messed up the 'A Elbereth Gilthoniel' hymn on a card title (and I think there was another one I'm forgetting?), so I wasn't *completely* ready to rule out them making a non-unique hero and just sticking with the name Quickbeam for some reason.

Well, if it is about just having fun - you don't need their permission, just go hog wild with 3 Splorfindels like there is no tomorrow.

 

There is nothing wrong with a possibility of a non-unique hero, it is just too obvious that Quickbeams lack of unique symbol is a mistake.

I like to stick within the rules.

There's still the possibility that FFG will see this mistake, conclude that it doesn't break anything in the game too badly, and just leave it be as opposed to issuing another errata.

In which case I'd grab up 2x more of the pack.

Born Aloft isn't an error with the potential to break fundamental interactions of the game. It's just a bad card. You don't errata bad cards. You errata broken cards, and you errata obvious errors.

Quickbeam will be errata'ed. The simple existence of a Quickbeam ally that is also unique will guarantee that.

Born Aloft may not be a good card, but I think the errata needed is just for the name -- should be borne aloft.  Even eagles aren't born aloft, they haven't learned to fly yet.

I'm sure Quickbeam will be errataed, but I doubt a three-Quickbeam grouping would break anything fundamental.

Yea, obviously its is a "fake". It was done with StrangeEons. Typing "enterprises" was to long for me. :/

I printed that card because I wanted to test that hero. I used Elrond and Mirlonde (Pippin will work also; same theat, same questing power, a bit more pragile, not so much synergy with SilvanTracker, but better printed abilities and also synergy with the new event from that pack) as other heroes, adding "all the usual ent things" plus some cards to fill up to 50 cards...

Had a spare time today, managed to upload the encounter cards of this set (haven't seen some of them around)

If anyone was still curious on a Quickbeam ruling now that the pack is out, I sent the question in to FFG, just to be sure:

So what the **** was with the delay if not to fix Quickbeam?

*sigh*

IMO the delay was essentially a spacing out of the packs so that there wasn't a huge gap between Crossings and Rhovanion.  Caleb has been busy working on the digital version of the game and there are only so many hours in the day.  Prepare for a new normal.

The slow pace of this cycle's release was dominated by a single huge gap between two packs.  I'll grant the possibility that the slowdown was intentional to prevent an overlong gap before Rhovanion, but surely it would have made more sense to space the packs evenly?

With the Saga releases complete and not being replaced with other content (unless you count the digital game), I think we're going to end up with a two month gap between releases going forward, double what it was in the past. This is sort of expected, since we had 1.5 developers working on the card game (100% of Caleb's time and 50% of Matt's time), we now have about 0.75 developers working on it. So while the game still has a long life ahead, I think we will have to unfortunately get used to longer intervals between content.

I need the longer intervals.  I only have like 10% of the expansions.  It's gonna take me a very long time to get caught up.  (Just got back into the game recently) after 5 years or so

No I haven't seen it anywhere in the UK.

Same here. It's getting a little vexing.

You can just order directly from FFG's website.

I pre-ordered it from my usual supplier months ago, when its release looked imminent, so i've already paid for it. I don't understand what the holdup is.

I see. I like to avoid pre-orders because of all the logistic mess like this.

Still no sign, three weeks on.

According to the PDF that Asmodee puts out (and my FLGS in the North East uses) Crossing of Poros is out next week (and it's about flipping time)

Holy!! And I thought here in Chile we had delayed product. I've had my Crossings of Poros for weeks now!

I think there was one product for LOTR that never got an official release over here but I'm pretty sure that Poros is the most delayed release to actually (hopefully) hit stores in the UK.

Finally received my copy yesterday.
