 Yes, it's amazing.

A blast to watch and very intuitive to use.

Thx !

 

Edit: I notice some mistakes though. Faramir & Guard of the Citadel are not displayed when sorting cards with the Gondor trait.

Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Look for updated versions with this fixed (along with any other errors people point out).
