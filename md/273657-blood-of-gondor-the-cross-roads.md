The Cross-Roads is put in the staging area at the beginning of the quest (stage 1A). It reads "The current quest card gains siege (and loses battle)"  However the current quest card does not have "battle", 1B is a normal questing stage. Stage 2 does have battle. Are the parenthesis assuming someone leaves The Cross Roads in staging until you get to 2A/B?  

For Stage 1B I treat it as siege until I explore The Cross-Roads correct?

Oh, follow up question on same quest. Stage 1B says "At the beginning of the quest phase, each player takes 1 hidden card". Do I do this before activating an action such as Denethor's ability to look at the top card? Or can I activate Denethor before and then I know if my hidden card is an enemy or not?

Thanks!

Okay, just finished the scenario and I probably answered my own question. The encounter deck is small enough it was recycled so The Cross-Roads did come back up during stage 2B. This was actually a great help as my siege questing ability was in much better shape than my battle questing. I kept it in the staging area for the remainder of the game.

And when I played, I dealt the hidden card first, then activated Denethor.  I guess I could use the action window in the planning phase to use Denethor and look at what will become the hidden card instead...

Exactly right. There is no window at the start of the quest phase, but you can use Denethor in the planning

There is no possibility to make an action before resolving an encounter "at the beginning of", we must first resolve it before even checking if we have an action windows. But we have an action window on the beginning of the quest phase (after this effect), so your answer is quite disturbing.

I expressed myself poorly - you expressed what I meant better.  What I was trying to say was that the was no opportunity for actions before triggers that go off at the beginning of the phase.  There is definitely a  action window before committing characters to the quest.

And with the Crossroads, I believe there are cards that change the "type" of quest to Battle, which the Crossroads mitigates.
