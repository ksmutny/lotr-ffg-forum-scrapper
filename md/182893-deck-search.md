I bought 14 expansions on Sunday. 0__0

 

In other news, my Caldara deck is nearly complete. I've only a few 'Out of Stock' expansions to find. I tested it last night and while it was very fun, I didn't see a single Fortune or Fate.

 

It got me thinking - with my two roommates also joining me in games, one of whom has been building a Lore deck, are there cards in the game that permit a target player to search her deck for a specific card and either discard or draw it, shuffling the deck afterwards?

Gather Information, Word of Command, Mirror of Galadriel. That's all I remember but I think that's it.

Oh good I have Mirror of Galadriel. I used Galadriel, Eowyn, and Caldara last night. It was fun but I couldn't fend off even the weakest enemies. I was a quest wizard tho.

 

How does something like Gather Information work?

If you've got a mono spirit deck your best bet for finding specific cards is just discarding as much of your deck as you can using Emery, Zigil Miners, etc. Then play the cards you need directly from your discard using Dwarven Tomb, Map of Earnil, Stand and Fight, etc.

 

That said, if you are using Galadriel and her mirror it shouldn't be hand to find Fortune of Fate when you need it.

 

As for Gather Information (and other side quests) you can read about them here: https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2015/1/20/shall-we-turn-east-or-west/ [https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2015/1/20/shall-we-turn-east-or-west/]

Another tactic is to get a card draw engine going so that you can draw cards into your hand very quickly, which eliminates the need to search for them. Lore hero Bilbo from The Hunt for Gollum is good for this. I only know the cards up to Conflict at the Carrock, so I'm sure there are subsequent cards that could be used to construct a powerful card draw engine. I have heard of players drawing their entire deck on the first turn.

Unfortunately if you are building a Caldara deck you severely handicap the strategy by bringing a non-spirit hero.

I've actually found Eowyn/Caldara/Galadriel can do pretty OK combat-wise, because if you use Caldara to muster 4-cost Spirit allies, they all have 2 attack and 2 defence, which is the best you can get from Spirit allies. Hobbit Gandalf is also really useful. It's actually kind of my go-to deck for trying to solo Nightmare quests at this point.

That mirror is unreliable! Haha it was fun but we won the game tonight before I even pulled Fortune or Fate into my hand. -___-

I'm very excited to try Idraen. I think she'll be the muscle my list has been missing. I originally had Eowyn, Caldara,and Idraen in mind for my list but after trying Galadriel,her ring, and her mirror I am really at a loss for who to cut. Ironically, Caldara is the weakest link by far.
