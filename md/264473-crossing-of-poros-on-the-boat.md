Exactly a year to the day it was spoiled. Did they ever give us an official reasoning behind its delay? I knew Quickbeam was missing his unique symbol but I don't know if FFG ever came out and confirmed that was the reason or not.

So with Quickbeam officially not unique, anyone going to shell out 3x for a Quickbeam/Quickbeam/Quickbeam lineup?

I have a dim recollection of someone finding a line in the rule book that basically said it doesn't matter if a hero has the unique symbol or not.  Did I dream it?

Someone (NathanH?) had a nice post pointing out that the imprecision of the Core set rules regarding uniqueness allowed for all kinds of shenanigans… In particular:

> Quote
> 
> If any player has a unique card in play, no player can play or put into play another card with the same title. Any attempt to do so will fail to the extent that the card attempting to enter play remains in its current location (hand, deck, discard pile) and does not enter play. This rule applies to all unique hero, ally, attachment, and event cards that might enter play. 

Since starting heroes do not "enter play"—the relevant line in the rules is that they are "placed in front" of you—the above paragraph doesn't apply to heroes. Technically. Everybody gets an Aragorn! Or 3!

I would give anyone in my group trying to take advantage of this a wedgie.

Since Quickbeam is (uniquely) not a unique hero, I don't think that text applies to him.  The game has a way to indicate uniqueness, Quickbeam doesn't have it, and given that the potential problem has been known for *months* it's obviously not important to FFG that it be fixed.

Of course, between the expense involved in buying three packs and the inevitable FAQ correction I don't actually expect anyone to run triple Quickbeam.  I wouldn't be a fan at all of delaying Crossings of Poros six months -- I want my Magic Ring!  But given that they *did* delay Crossings of Poros for six months, if anyone attempts to exploit the lack of a symbol, good for them.

Too bad they didn't delay it to actually correct Quickbeam.

Not sure how all this works with shipping and printing.  But we learned about Quickbeam missing his uniqueness symbol long ago, due to some people getting their packs early.  This means at least some packs were already printed at that time (in other words: past the stage where correction is possible).    Best guess is all packs were already printed way back then, when some people got theirs early.  The Quickbeam you now hold in your hand was already printed when those first pictures went online.  

So the error was likely discovered after printing occurred.  With that in mind, it would be a terrible financial decision to trash them all and get them reprinted.  So no, I wouldn't expect the delay had resulted from needing to get him corrected.

What if FFG doesn't even know about the error? Haha

I thought the delay was for Quickbeam.  I guess now we wait to see how the announce the rest of the years products, and we'll see if they really are slowing down now that the saga is over.

If they were all printed by July 11, 2017, I wouldn't expect them to reprint it just to fix Quickbeam.  Issuing an errata is far more logical.  However, if they were all printed by July 11, 2017, I'd expect the pack to be released before February 2018.  Taking at least seven months for a printed product to get to stores doesn't seem like a great financial decision either, though maybe they thought a massive unexplained delay in the middle of a cycle is preferable to a massive unexplained delays between cycles.  But it's clearly taken *much* longer to get to market than they thought a year ago, and if they were printed on the original schedule the delay is mystifying.

I'm operating under the assumption it was out of their hands.

I don't believe that for a second.  I believe that with Caleb working on the DCG they knew that Rhovanion wasn't going to be released until this summer and so the started to delay the releases instead of having a 9 to 12 month break.

## 34 [Authraw on February 9, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/264473-crossing-of-poros-on-the-boat/?do=findComment&comment=3206627)

Yeah, I suspect that they knew they needed a big delay sometime (although it's anyone's guess as to why) so they decided to put it in the middle of a cycle rather than between them in order to stave off "the game is dead" rumours. We still have them all the time, but I feel like they would be much worse if we had the delay between products and didn't have anything "still in the queue".

No way.  There is simply no way that there won't be more demands on Caleb's time.  We have a new normal now which will be slower than the old normal.  (As inconceivable as that is.)

The wait between packs is just ridiculous now. I only get to play games once or twice a week at the moment, but since the last pack was released, I've finished up my saga campaign, got into Arkham Horror LCG and am now half way though the third campaign. At this point I'm starting not to care about this game anymore. I've found this cycle quite lacklustre, and prolonged waits between mediocre scenarios isn't helping.

Much harder than Cirith Gurat and much harder to play right too.  Take your time reading the cards folks.

So meanwhile I wait for release at my country, has this last AP taken the title of "closing the cycle the hard way", like we've been used in the past (except one or two cycles)?

Guys, just grabbed from my FLGS The Crossings of Poros here in Spain and take a look at Quickbeam (Ramaviva).

This has been the second strange thing that has happened not only on this cycle but I think on the entire game since release: first, a front image different to the rest of, at least, USA/English version for The Dungeons of Cirith Gurat (you guys have an orc? I have the dungeon warg). And then, Quickbeam hero with the "unique" icon.

What a strange site to live.

It is the same for french: different front image (french trad team says it is because FFG US change the front on last minute) and quickbeam have the right design (unique).

Also the German version has the correct unique symbol on Quickbeam. In addition, Asmodee UK has blocked the distribution of the english pack stated to be released the 8th of February. Maybe they are adding the correct card?

But the english pack seem to be released with the mistake on the US. It will be strange if, in Europe only, we get the right version, even in english ^^.
