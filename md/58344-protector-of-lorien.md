 If you were to put 2 PoL's on a character, do you +2 then for each card that is discarded?

That would be cool, but I don't think that's how it works.

 In order to trigger a card ability, you must pay its cost.  In this case, to trigger PoL, you must discard a card.  The copy of PoL you didn't trigger doesn't care about that card, since you didn't trigger it.

You're right - that's not how it works.

yes it doesnt work like that, to get +2 you would have to discard 2 cards regardless.  im not sure if there is much benefit attaching two to a character as the POL action is not limited and doesnt need to exhaust etc. so you could discard as many cards as able to and get what ever effects you wish from it

 Thanks guys!  That's what I figured, but thought I might as well ask!
