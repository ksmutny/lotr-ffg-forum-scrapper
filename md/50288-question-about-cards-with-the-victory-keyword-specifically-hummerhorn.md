From the rulebook

Some enemy and locations cards award victory points when they are defeated. When such a card leaves play, one player should.....

 

My question is:

Can a card be considered defeated even if it has no effect..... example a Hill Troll as a shadow card(do i get the victory points???)...

OK, obviously a monster is considered defeated if killed by any means and a location is considered defeated if it is explored....

 

My question is based on the card Hummerhorn which has Victory Points. It has a really nasty shadow effect that can make you loose the game or cripples you real bad. Now OK if i kill the hummerhorn i get the VP for sure but what if i draw Hummerhorn as a shadow card and it takes effect??? Shouldn't i get the VP for surviving such a thing???

 

P.S. So far i am only counting as VP only killed and explored locations because i want to be fair with my results but Hummerhorns shadow effect with VP has got me into thinking.

No, you need to defeat it in combat. When it comes as a shadow card, normal "discard of shadow card"-rules apply.
