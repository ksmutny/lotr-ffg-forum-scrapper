I'm still relatively new to this game and, as my other posts would indicate, I'm still way behind on my collection. I'm still work on the Mirkwood cycle. I have been having difficulty finding these packs in the stores. Is there an online website that's good to buy from that has little shipping cost?

i get all of my adventure packs and sets with miniaturemarket.com; not only do they have a rewards program but their prices are great and the shipping is reasonable (you can get an adventure pack, with shipping, for less than MSRP in most cases). hope this helps!

 I can sell you my core set + the first 4 chapter packs (Through The Hills of Emyn Muil). I also have the Massing at Osgilith scenario from GenCon. Contact me on my site at Lotrlcg.com [http://www.lotrlcg.com/] and we can figure something out.

 

All the cards have been sleeved and were really only used for scanning for the site. The game didn't appeal to my non-gamer friends like I thought it would, and I will be playing 3 FFG LCGs once Netrunner and Star Wars come out, so I stopped buying LOTR.

Thanks for the website Dain. Those prices are really good.

 

Mason240, I may be in touch. I already have the 1st two Mirkwood sets and a Core but I may want a 2nd core set.
