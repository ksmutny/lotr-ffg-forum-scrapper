Sorry. newbie here asking the question about something everyone has heard one hundred times, and I did search around quite a bit.

l know I have to pull out Ungoliant, already beaten or not, but I haven't found quite the answer I'm looking for. "When revealed: each player must search encounter deck and discard pile for 1 Spider card of his choice, and add it to the staging area." I know i have to pull out Spawn, but do I ALSO pull another Spider? OR is the pretty little lady my "choice"?

And while I have your attention, the planning stage is the only time you can play allies & attachments. Do I have that right.

Fascinating game.

Thanx in advance for your help.

Now lets go questing!

Hi dizpatcher!

 

1) You're allowed to choose ANY spider, so it doesn't have to be Ungoliant's Spawn. It makes sense though to choose the big ugly one, as you have to find and defeat her to win the game.

 

2) You have that right about allies and attachments. Some cards like "Sneak Attack" allow you to play allies or attachments in other phases of the game, but they explicitely say so.
