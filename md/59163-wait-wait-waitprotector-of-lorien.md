I was listening to Episode #10 of CoTR and heard Brian talk about a game where they played "Protector of Lorien" and discarded a ton of cards to get like "45 willpower"...I thought only "X" cards could be used like that?

no there is no restriction.....get bilbo with double card draw and beravor, and you can discard tonnes of cards per turn

how in the heck are we supposed to know this? I have been told so many times to "do what the card says"...i am really frustrated now...how many cards do i have that say one thing and mean something else.

The only part of the Protector of Lorien card is the ACTION. I guess, there is not rule to the number of ACTIONS you can take....that would allow repeated use of this card...you just envoke the action over and over.

if an action is not limited- ie quest action or limited once per turn etc then it can be used each and EVERY green window in the chart at the back of the rule book

It can be used over and over in the same "green window" correct? I invoke the action, discard....invoke the action, discard, and so on till i don't want to invoke the action anymore...that could all be done in the same "green window"

yeah....think of it more like .....'i want an extra 7 willpower of bilbo' so ill use his protector of lorien, discard 7 cards and get that. you could think of doing the action 7 times over, which is technically what youre doing

The card says very clearly... . "Discard a card from your hand 2to add...." There is no provisions on the card limiting it to only ONCE a turn. Still, look at the card.. there is NOTHING on the card that says you can not do it multiple times, you do not need to tap it even.. you just discard a card to do it... that is the end of an action, then hey .. I'll do a 2nd action, that is a 2nd card discard. You just need to read the cards very carefully, the card behaves exactly as it is written, so to know how the card works.. you just need to read it.

It is true that these types of card games foster "game lawyers". It is just something you get used to the complex interaction of rules, as you play more of these type of games.

There is the argument that they could have made it "discard X cards to give +X... " this would have been clearer. Though there is a subtle difference here, as that card would discard all the cards in a single action. While at the moment to discard 10 cards is 10 actions. This leaves the game rules with the ability to disrupt this card at any time between each action. Say they make a location "Every player action add a encounter card to the staging area" or something like that. In these games many card are designed in a way that is a little odd, to allow the designers to add more functionality to the game latter.

So unless the card specifically limits the number of times you can use its action, you can assume it can be used over and over

yes. Unless the action requires a condition.. like say tapping.

longbeard map maker is another good example of unlimited buffing

Blowing my mind here. I need to go back thru and look at some of the cards i have used that i limited without knowing i could use them more.

lots of people got mapmaker wrong, then suddenly he is like one of the best cards in the game :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] I know I was backwards about him at first.

It's not just him, any ACTION card can be used multiple times...that is what is sticking with me here. This opens the game up much more. I played Journey Down the Anduin and had like 22 cards in my hand at one point. Knowing this about the Action cards could have saved me an ugly defeat.
