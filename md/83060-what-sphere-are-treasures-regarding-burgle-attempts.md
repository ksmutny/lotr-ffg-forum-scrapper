# [What sphere are Treasures? (Regarding Burgle attempts)](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83060-what-sphere-are-treasures-regarding-burgle-attempts/)

I'm playing the Lonely Mountain quest from The Hobbit: On the Doorstep and while performing a Burgle attempt I revealed a Treasure card from the top of my deck, specifically Glamdring. For the Burgle attempt to be a success I have to discard 1 card from my hand that matches the revealed card's sphere and type.

My question is what is Glamdring's (and all other Treasures') sphere? As far as I know there isn't really a Treasure sphere nor are Treasure cards considered to be Baggins sphere. Are they neutral? I have another Treasure card in my hand that I could discard in order to have a successful Burgle attempt but I wasn't sure if that would satisfy the condition.

 

Thoughts? help?

Thanks!
