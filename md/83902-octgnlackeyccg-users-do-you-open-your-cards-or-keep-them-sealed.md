Last year, I  played with the cards, and got through Rhogobel. 

This year, I've been playing using OCTGN rather than the actual cards.  This is mostly for convenience, but also lack of a good playing table.

I've just finished Rhosgobel, and am starting Emyn Muil.  I hadn't opened the Emyn Muil pack yet, so it was sort of exciting to physically open it, even if I'm going to be playing in OCTGN.

But then I realized that by opening the cards, I'm devaluing them.

So I am wondering: for those of you who play virtually (via OCTGN, LackeyCCG, or VASSAL), do you open your quest packs and expansions?  Or do you keep them sealed?

I open them since I do my own scans to use (no "censored" copies for me). And I still play IRL with friends or solo from time to time.

I open the cards because I play with friends too. If I didn't play this game with friends, I'd probably be a loser and not even buy the packs.
