If i had these to in the same deck could each hero attack the same enemy in the staging area at different times of the combat phase? So, could haldir make an attack and then Dunhere make an attack?

The rulebook states that you can only declare 1 attack on each enemy engaged. It does not comment on how many attacks can be declared if the enemy is not engaged.

Dunhere text does say if he attacks alone, but i read Haldir like Quick Strike which can grant an additional attack on the same enemy in the same combat phase.

Further, can Haldir attack an enemy that engaged the previous round cor the normal attack, and then attack it again using his combat action, as long as no new enemies were engaged that round?

I don't think you can combine the attacks because Haldir's attack is an action, not a regular attack like Dunhere.

## 3 [Tracker1 on August 23, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/114445-haldir-and-dunhere/?do=findComment&comment=1220375)

I'm not suggesting combining them.

 

Let's say Haldir attacks the enemy in the staging area at the beginning of the combat phase, and then Dunhere makes his attack on the same enemy in the staging area later in the combat phase.

## 4 [GrandSpleen on August 23, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/114445-haldir-and-dunhere/?do=findComment&comment=1220500)

I wondered the same thing as soon as I saw Haldir's ability, but the FAQ prevents it:

 



"If, through card effects such as ranged, a player is able

to declare attacks against enemies with which he is

not engaged, he is still only permitted a single attack

against each of these enemies."


## 5 [alogos on August 23, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/114445-haldir-and-dunhere/?do=findComment&comment=1220602)

Dunhere can declare an attack, but Haldir is an action that declare him as an attacker, like Swift  Quick Strike. Thus Dunhere count towards your attack limit, but not Haldir, you are just exhausting him, not making a regular attack.

Nope, i would love this to work too, but if you read grandspleen his quote, you can't do this.

Haldir is a card effect, and so there is no chance for a second attack according to this FAQ rule.

Shame though.

## 7 [Tracker1 on August 23, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/114445-haldir-and-dunhere/?do=findComment&comment=1220774)

Interesting, I don't play 2 player, but I always thought player 1 could exhaust a ranged character and play quickstrike on an enemey engaged with player 2 and then ready that character and then declare a ranged attack on the same enemy during player 1 combat phase, and ready again to participate in an attack declared by player 2 on the same enemy

Sorry if I am completely bashing these rules, it's been a long time since playing 2 player

The limitation of attack's declaration is thoses made by players.

In case of Haldir and Quick Strike, the player does not declare an attack, those you bypass the limit.

## 9 [Tracker1 on August 23, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/114445-haldir-and-dunhere/?do=findComment&comment=1220909)

Okay, to sum it up, a player controlling both Haldir and Dunhere can attack the same enemy in the staging area at different times during the combat phase.

Eh? That's odd. Doesn't this contradict the 1st part of the quote grandspleen posted completely?

Confused camel here....

How about we ask Caleb to be sure?

Guys, guys, guys.  Haldir and Quick Strike both make you "declare" an attack.  It's in the card text!  There is no bypass from Declaration Highway here.  

 

> Interesting, I don't play 2 player, but I always thought player 1 could exhaust a ranged character and play quickstrike on an enemey engaged with player 2 and then ready that character and then declare a ranged attack on the same enemy during player 1 combat phase, and ready again to participate in an attack declared by player 2 on the same enemy
> 
>  

 

Then for this: Player 1 has an Orc engaged.  Player 2 has a ranged Elf.  He can use Quickstrike, exhaust Mr. Elf, and attack Player 1's Orc.  That is one attack declaration.  Then if he can ready Mr. Elf, he can participate in an attack declared by Player 1 against the same Orc.  He cannot, however, declare his own new attack against the same Orc even if he can be readied a third time.

Well, for me, it is

Haldir and Quick Strike both make you  them "declare" an attack.

I'll ask Caleb then.

Yeah, I think this is correct, going off the (almost) identical wording to Quick Strike and this [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/index.php?/topic/1702-official-nate-rule-clarifications/?p=12231] clarification from Nate.

 

EDIT: I don't think this:

 

> "If, through card effects such as ranged, a player is able

applies to Haldir or Quick Strike because that refers to declaring attacks using the standard game framework.

On the other hand, 'immune' cards can be affected by Quick Strike, and the entire justification behind this in the FAQ is that Quick Strike, unlike Hands Upon the Bow, simply enables a standard game framework effect (declaring an attack).  So if Quick Strike falls into the 'framework effect' category, these limits should apply, yes?

Yes, they probably should.  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

Except that they're already ruled you can use Quick Strike to attack the same enemy twice.

 

Could you argue that it's the declaration (rather than the attack as a whole) that is limited, and that Quick Strike performs the declaration as a card effect? I'm not sure at this point!

## 18 [GrandSpleen on August 25, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/114445-haldir-and-dunhere/?do=findComment&comment=1224531)

Well, that ruling from Nate is 2 years old and doesn't appear in the FAQ.  The designers previously ruled that Hands Upon the Bow could be used to target immune enemies (now it cannot) and that shadow cards did not count as "encounter cards" (now they do).  We'll just have to wait and see what Caleb says.

While we wait for an answer, here's another question for you: say you've got Merry/Pippin/Sam or some such deck.  If you were to play Hobbit-sense...

 

Hobbit-sense.png [http://hallofbeorn.com/Images/Cards/Encounter-at-Amon-Din/Hobbit-sense.png]

 

Would you say you could then use Quick Strike to attack enemies?  Or if you played this, then got Haldir from another player via Desperate Alliance, would it be a legal play to use his ability to attack enemies (provided they were already engaged this turn)?

## 21 [alogos on August 30, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/114445-haldir-and-dunhere/?do=findComment&comment=1238563)

Looks like it cannot since "cannot" is the strongest wording on cards we know so far. So it always has higher priority. Next to that other players can always declare ranged attacks on the enemies engaged with you, you just cannot participate in those attacks yourself.

What you can do, is use "Quick Strike" in any phase but the combat phase. For Example, you use "Quick Strike" in "encounter phase" or "refresh phase".

And here's the answer :

>  
> 
>  
> 
> The limitations on attacks has to do with the number of attacks the game itself grants each player against an enemy each round. The extra language in the FAQ that reads: “If, through card effects such as ranged, a player is able to declare attacks against enemies with which he is not engaged, he is still only permitted a single attack against each of these enemies” is there because the core rules insert does not address the issues of ranged attacks. It simply reads: “A player has the opportunity to declare 1 attack against each enemy with which he is engaged.” So FAQ item 1.11 is meant to clarify that you are also limited to 1 attack against enemies you are not engaged with.
> But again, those are attacks made via the Attacking Enemies step of the combat phase. Card effects such as Quick Strike and Haldir are special abilities that grant attacks in addition to the normal attacks granted by the combat phase. That means you can use Quick Strike to attack an enemy that you have already attacked that phase.

 

Maybe I should ask for GrandSpleen's question too, because it was not an answer about player declaring or character declaring.

I would say you cannot use extra attack's cards when playing Hobbit Sense however.

> Further, can Haldir attack an enemy that engaged the previous round cor the normal attack, and then attack it again using his combat action, as long as no new enemies were engaged that round?

 

No because Haldir specifically says that his ability only works with enemies not engaged with you.

I have sent a follow-up question about Hobbit-sense and to see if we can clarify the FAQ entry a bit further.  Will post on here once I get a response.

## 29 [GrandSpleen on September 13, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/114445-haldir-and-dunhere/?do=findComment&comment=1260854)

I got an answer.  The question was "can you use cards to attack enemies in the same phase after you play Hobbit-sense," and "what cards does FAQ entry 1.11 apply to."  Here is the reply:

 

Let me answer your second question first: FAQ entry 1.11 was meant to clarify that the game only grants each player 1 attack against each enemy even when using Ranged. That was because the way the core rules were written the restriction only applied to enemies engaged with you. Entry 1.11 should NOT be interpreted as limiting all additional methods of declaring attacks, such as Quick Strike, Hands Upon the Bow, Great Yew Bow or Haldir. Those methods are card effects that generate attacks and are thus exempt from the rule that limits the number of attacks granted by the core game rules and FAQ.
That leads us into your first question: Hobbit-sense prevents enemies engaged with you from making attacks granted by the Resolve Enemy Attacks step of the combat phase, and it prevents you from making attacks granted by the Attacking Enemies step. It does not prevent you from using those other card effects I mentioned. Those cards generate attacks but they do not technically “declare attacks” as described in the rules because they skip skip the declaration of attack and step 1 of Attacking Enemies by having you choose an enemy target and telling you which character to exhaust. 
Cheers,
Caleb

-------------------

 

So: the 'once per round' rule applies only to attacks declared through the normal framework (which includes Ranged attacks).  Any card effect granting an 'extra' attack will not consume your 'once per round' declaration limit.  So you can attack an enemy in the staging area via your normal attack with Dunhere, then follow-up with a second attack using Haldir's ability.  

 

And, Hobbit-sense doesn't prevent you from attacking enemies via card effects.

No. The second one refere to immunity, not to additional declaration of attack.

It does seem that way when you read them out of context, but you shouldn't read them out of context.

## 32 [DaeMord on September 13, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/114445-haldir-and-dunhere/?do=findComment&comment=1260980)

actually i disagree, these 2 subjects overlap if an extra attack is not a framework effect, then quickstrike should not be able to be used against imune to player card effect mobs, however if it is a framework effect then you should not be able to be used in the way defined above.

 

Quick strike in the faq was specificly defined to target the hero card and then do an attack using framework effects, in order that it could be used against mobs who are imune to player card effects, the wording above from caleb would suggest that actually quickstrike targets the mob in question thus should be effected by things that prevent non framework effects from happening

 

The 2 rulings are in contradiction, either it produces a framework effect and targets the hero, or it doesnt and targets the mob, but then cannot be used against immune to player card effects

 

this effects anything doing anything like this, and tbh shouldnt be seen to be doing both because if it is targeting the mob, but bypassing imunity, this raises questions about what is a "framework effect" and once again raises "immunity to player card effects" as a somewhat confusing and ildefined ruling

## 33 [alogos on September 13, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/114445-haldir-and-dunhere/?do=findComment&comment=1261083)

Immunity rules are weird, and I could not prove you wrong. This is not the first ruling I turn a blind eye on.

## 34 [GrandSpleen on September 13, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/114445-haldir-and-dunhere/?do=findComment&comment=1261223)

DaeMord, I agree and said pretty much exactly the same thing earlier in this thread.  If it's a framework effect it shouldn't be breaking limits imposed on framework effects, if it's not a framework effect it shouldn't work against immune enemies.

 

My gut tells me that we are dealing a little with 'tradition' rather than just consistent reasoning, and devs are trying to clarify current rules questions, especially as they relate to newer game effects, without overturning old rulings (the old Quick Strike ruling vs. the newer immunity rules).  It leads to explanations that look contradictory.

 

alogos has the correct response, I think.

## 35 [DaeMord on September 13, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/114445-haldir-and-dunhere/?do=findComment&comment=1261252)

I do agree thats probably what were looking at, the concern i have, is when you compile all of these rules together you end up arriving at this kind of conclusion.

 

You can use quick strike on Hero Beorn to attack an enemy that is also imune to player card effects.

 

This may be the ruling but it just seems wrong to me.

 

I feel personally that quick strike could do with an erata to clarify exactly what it is and is not targetting, and could we please have a specific definition on EXACTLY what a framework effect is, because i struggle to define a framework effect that actually allows all these rules to happen consistently, and without simply being "because caleb says so"

i mean ill grant you that all rules are ultimately that, but if were completely honest even if it is just "cause caleb says so" the very least we would like to see is internal consistency that you dont have rules breaking rules, which potentially is exactly what is happening right here

Hi all,

 

I'm going through my mind-breaking construction of a new Haldir deck.

Do we declare an attack with the combat action of Haldir, or is it just a Combat action that enables you to declare Haldir as an attacker. I got 2 questions for it:

1. Unseen strike

Question: Can we use Unseen Strike when using the Combat Action of Haldir.

2. Black Arrow

 

Question: Can we use Black Arrow when using the Combat Action of Haldir.

This might seem dumb questions, but I'm rather confused on this topic, so wanted to check it.

## 37 [alogos on October 15, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/114445-haldir-and-dunhere/?do=findComment&comment=1300173)

Haldir is declared as an attacker and resolve his attack, so no problem with unseen strike or black arrow, or almost every cards you can think of.
