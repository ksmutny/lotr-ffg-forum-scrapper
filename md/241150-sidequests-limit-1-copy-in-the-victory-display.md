Hi Folks,

with the Haradrim Cycle we got new sidequests. The old ones were limited by 1 per deck, which is very simple to play and handle.
But the new once have a limitation about 1 copy in the victory display. So i think i can include 3 copies of them into my deck and can play 2 or more of them at the same time (they are not unique), but can i make one of them to the current quest if a copy of this side quest is currently in the victory display?

Were does an explored side quest go if there is a copy of it currently in the victory display?

It goes in the owner's discard pile (there is a paragraph on that in the Sands of Harad rule book).  I see no reason why you couldn't play multiple copies of the same quest into the staging area.

Rules aside, is there a particular reason why you want to do this? Building a deck that uses East Road Ranger as the main source of willpower to bide time for the deck to get running?

Nope .. no reason simply asking. The new Thurindir-Hero get's +1 WIL for each Side Quest in the victory display.  I only want to check how max +WIL i could give him in Solo and MP.

Ah .. thanks .. i do not own the SoH-Box, so i don't know the rule. That helps.
