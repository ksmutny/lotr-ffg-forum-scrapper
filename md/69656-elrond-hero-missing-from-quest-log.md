It is very irritating that FFG is so slow in updating the quest log system with new heroes. No sign of Elrond from Shadow and Flame which has been out for over two weeks.

I use it for every game I play. I really like it.

I've also been trying to use it.

Yes, the Quest Log is a nice tool for keeping track of ones victories. It is fun to see the statistics on hero uses for one self and the community. However, multiplayer games could be better supported.

Anyway, FFG, please support Quest Log properly and add the new heroes as soon as they are released. It can't be that much work.

I don't see the new quests either.

 

But I'm another that uses it for every game I play.

I still use it. Just haven't had much time to play lately.
