 Took a while, but I knew this deck would work eventually!!!

Heros-denethor, eowyn, gimli

Neutral cards-gandalf(3); radagast, (2); song of kings (3); song of wisdom (1); song of travel (1).

Lore-daughter of the nimrodel (1); miner of the iron hills (2); self-preservation (2); forest snare (2); lore of imladris (1).

Leadership-steward of gondor (2); sneak attack (2).

Spirit-unexpected courage (1); stand & fight (2); the riddemark's finest (2); dwarven tomb (1); the galadrim's greeting (2).

Tactics-quick strike (2); beorn (1); gondorian spearman (2); feint (2); landroval (1); beorning beekeeper (2); swift strike (1); horn of gondor (1); winged guardian (2); dwarven axe (2); descendant of thorondor (2); citadel plate (2).

 

It worked, ESP. When Gimli ended up with two dwarven axes and two damage on him for a 8 attack paired with grimbeorn's attack!

Since direct damage from both Treacheries and Shadow effects is missing in Carrock, getting Gimli + 2xCitadel Plates up to 12 damage is fairly easy and safe to do. Then you just swing for 14 just by himself cool.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/cool.gif] .

 Yes, for sure!  Just weren't part of my draw last night, but the axes helped instead!

 Ugh!  I just realized I might have played a card at the wrong time in last nights game that could have changed the overall.  Might have won might have not if i had played it at the appropriate time.  Sometimes this game is so frustrating!
