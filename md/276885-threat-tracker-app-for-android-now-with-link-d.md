# [Threat Tracker App for Android (now with link :D )](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/276885-threat-tracker-app-for-android-now-with-link-d/)

This is an edit, the old post follows below.

-----------------------------

As I am bad at advertising, here is the link LotR_LCG_Helper v1.44 (Dropbox) [https://www.dropbox.com/s/1blnqfvealkvqmp/LotR_LCG_Helper.apk?dl=0]

The app does not require anything on your phone.

Features:

 * Keeps track of your threat, and amount of rounds
 * Can help compute the quest resolution for up to 4 players (optional, does not affect Threat and Round counters)
 * Show a time table: how long did each round take
 * Has a data base which keep track of the games you've played
 * Shows statistics to each mission: e.g. win ratio per mission, per player count, avg. time, amount of games played,...

I think everything is quite self-explanatory, exept the Start Over button. Dues to safty reasons you have to hold it longer to reset the state.

Due to hardware limitations I tested the app only on my own mobile. Dunno how well it works on others. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] Anyhow, feel free to give feedback.

I do not know if this post violates any forum restictions. I do not want to harm anyone, just share this for free.

Hey,

because I was bored, I tried to build an android app. (I am new to the procedure of programming apps for mobile.) So far, I have a very simple one which tracks your threat and counts the rounds. Nothing special, but I thought maybe others want it, too. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] No adds and hopefully for free, of course!

This is where the real questions kick in. ?

I used some LotR pictures (which are probably copyrighted) as well as some icon graphics (from OCTGN, I think). So I do wonder about any legal issues. Any ideas if this simple app can "fly under the radar" without getting me in trouble, when making it public? Whom to contact at FFG(?) or anywhere else?

Also, it seems to me that when publishing at the android play store I am forced to have a Developers Account, which is 25$ just for registration. :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png] WTF!? I want to give something for free here.... ?

Any serious alternatives? Well, I could send the APK via mail...

Regards,

Flrbb

You could remove all the copyrighted material and publish on fdroid.

 

There are already some mtg apps on there.

If FFG let octgn live, they probably won't mind an app as long as you're not making profit on it.

@Flrbb [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/245439-flrbb/] Is this on the apple appstore?

No, it is not. I do own only an Android mobile. No possibility to test and develop for Apple on my side. Besides, I program only in my spare time. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] But if you know a way to convert a APK to whatever Apple needs, just let me know - I could try then...
