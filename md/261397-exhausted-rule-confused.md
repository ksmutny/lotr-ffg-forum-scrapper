If i use 2 characters to comit to a quest, the rule book says they are exhausted. So how can they fight or do anything else in the quest if the are used (exhausted).

Can you of my remaining characters jump in anf help later, like attach or defend or use other abilites?

If characters are exhausted they can't exhaust to attack or defend.  So in general you can't commit characters to the quest if you want them available to fight later.  However, there are card effects that let you ready characters (for example, Leadership Aragorn's ability, or Unexpected Courage), which will let you exhaust to quest and ready, allowing double-duty.

Wow. I was trying out all spirit heros from the core set. I was not getting any ally, so when I commited characters with no allies - this is when I realised how are they supposed to do anything if the very act of commiting makes them (exhausted) unable to help out in the quest. 

This game throws up a new MAJOR question every time I play it.
