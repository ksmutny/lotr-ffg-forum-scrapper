i have played both ranger spikes and expecting mischief into the staging area …..probably should have kept them for 1 by 1 play but i i forgot.

so…when i reveal a 2 health enemy, what happens? am i correct in thinking that the 2 damage kills it before it 'hits' the staging area, meaning the spikes arent attatched so are eligble for the next enemy?

the spikes says 'enters the staging area' but i dont think they do if they die

thanks

I would suggest to you Rich that the rules as they are currently written do not cover this timing scenario. These two cards do not use any of the timing language that has been defined in the rulebook or subsequent FAQs. So really it's up to you…

Yeah, not clear.  I think the best you can do is assume the effects are simultaneous, in which case the first player decides the order in which they are resolved.  Thus you could keep Ranger Spikes in the staging area by choosing to resolve Expecting Mischief first.
