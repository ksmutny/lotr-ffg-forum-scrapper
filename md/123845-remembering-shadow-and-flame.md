I have played Shadow and Flame since long time ago, i have some questions still i have noticed:

 

1. Why the quest card 3b has 1 quest point? It is useless..., last phrase writes: 'if you discard Durin's Bane by the ... location effect, then players win the game'.

Then? Why 1 quest point? It is irrellevant.

 

2. If you deal damage to Durin's Bane further than his hp..., do you put the extra damage tokens anyway on him... or only up to his hp (27)?

 

 

Thanks

I don't have that adventure pack yet… but maybe it's worth sending your questions to Caleb/FFG (especially the first one)?

No need.  You don't need the progress point to win.  It's just not a tight scenario design.  Extra parts and all that.
