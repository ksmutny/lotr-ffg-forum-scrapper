Just started to play the game, and I love it. Only thing that bothers me is the lack of female Hero's. Its 3 out of 22 Hero cards. If the world would be divided in these numbers we would be in decline for a world population..... Or atleast the Female's don't need to worry about a lack of attention.....

Even in the books of Tolkien these numbers are prity bad, there are loads of references to female hero's or mentioned (especially the elves and the horse tribes).

 

How you guys think about it?

tolkien's work is male heavy-just the way it is.....it isnt sexist, or anything like that, it just is. i certainly wouldnt say that tolkein has many references to female heros/characters, the silmarillion being the exception

i mean dont think i havnt thought about it, but FFG do have to keep to tolkiens work, which means they cant create too much of their own work

plus remember alot of the cards are soldiers- in middle earth women didnt go to war, with a few specific exeptions.....i dont know what else to say without starting to sound offensive, which im not intending to be....

prepare for it to not get any better- weve already seen the two main female from the trilogy - eowyn are arwen, and there really isnt many more....i think arwen will be at least an ally at some point, given the text of redhorn rule sheet

PS- also remember when tolkien wrote.....it was many decades ago.....the worlds changed....its the same (and dare i say this???) about saying there isnt many (insert colour of skin here) characters.....it was a different century (and millenia!!)

over the years ive seen many forum threads discussing the lack of variant in race/sex in tolkiens work, and i dont agree with any of them (not that im saying your saying any of this...its just a related point)

WELCOME TO THE GAME BY THE WAY

I think a lot of this is due to the time the original stories were written. While he is not sexist or racist, he is a product of him time and the entire time was sexist and racist. He dose have some meaty roles for girls. Ewoyn and Galadriel.. but that is pretty much it. Arwen doesn't count

As for the game in 2012.. well there is no excuse for not having female characters and heroes it is something my wife complains about every time we make a new deck. Making up Elenore had no ill effects... so make up some more.

I also think it might have something to do with the fact that Dwarfs are in a way androgynous construct. They are nearly entirely perceived as shortish men with beards. So much so that Terry Pratchett makes an entire run of jokes by having dwarf girls have full beards and look exactly like men. So when people see a fantasy female dwarf there just isn't the same resonance as we get from art form a male dwarf, because there is a lack of historical context of that image we can draw from. I'm not saying female dwarf images do not work or that we shouldn't see them.. I am just saying that in the vast majority of fantasy they are nvr even mentioned let alone have a collective image that people form different parts of the world will instantly recognise as a dwarf.

Still, I agree.. more chicks please.

As boored just said, they can create them. They did it with Beravor and Eleanor. Why not do it with other heroes?

As for characters in the generic sense, there are still a few female characters we may see further down the line: Galadriel, the lady of Tom Bombadil, the old lady that recognizes Aragorn as the king because he has the hands of a healer (sorry, I'm not too good remembering the names). I'm sure they can make up a number of Dale female characters. There's also Rosie Cotton and a few hobbit females referred to explicitely in the books. Maybe even an Entwife at some point? They could also use female art to represent non-gender specific allies

the main point here i think is that FFG have plenty of work taking characters from tolkiens creations- and if they forsook them just to be politically correct then i dont think that a good thing at all....i dont think they PURPOSELY stay away from females- its just theres so many offical characters to do- and they should come first - NO MATTER WHAT SEX (there see....im not being sexist)...and as ive said the official characters are mostly all male.....just the way it is

sorry to be controversial....but theres a hundred and more characters (as stated several female!!) that are in middle earth that FFG havnt touched on, why forget about them?

All in good time............

though.....given that the majority of FFG's audience are male (thats correct right??) im surprised (and pleased) that they havnt cashed in on that and made lots of nice looking female characters that have nothing to do with the game

I agree with richsabre.  Let's have real characters before adding any more fake ones.  You can already play a deck with all female heroes if you want.

As to the era in which Tolkien wrote, people had different levels of respect and honor for women then they do now.  Women were seen as the better nurturers, and thus the idea of them participating in wars made their stomachs turn.

Tolkien's friend, C.S. Lewis, the author of the Chronicles of Narnia series, wrote "Wars are ugly when women fight."

I don't know if he means they are ugly because the idea of a violent woman was ugly to him, or if he meant that seeing violence done to a woman was ugly to him.  It may have been both.  But even Lewis knew the value of arming the women of his stories with bows and arrows and daggers for self defense.

indeed - good points byron- and remember how horrifyed everyone was when derhelm/eowyn was revealed to be in the pelennor?  it would be rather un-tolkienist to change that fact

the key role of women in the trilogy at least is one of protecting the children, healers, ruling in the stead of men who have gone to war, and (after the last march on mordor) the utter last defence of middle earth....yes theres galadriel, but she is sort of one of the most powerful beings in middle earth, wilder of a ring of power, so is an expeption to this rule

ive noticed that two of the female characters are dunedain, and with their nature that is probably the safest bet that they can make, however there are no women in the grey company, they are all men.......so yeah....take that to be whatever you want it to be

the flip side is now of course theres nothing to stop female characters having other roles but soldiers- plenty of other things out there, i mean these are quests not wars....

yes things are different in this age, but so are a lot of things- this game's greatness is in its level of accuracy, which so far has been pretty good

anyways, my main points remains about the sheer amount of official characters there are to get through

ps....im looking forward to goldberry...she'll be an interesting character if we see her.....the entwives however were never found....still may not stop ffg..

pps....i have a bad feeling about this thread......

Interesting. My wife really dislikes playing with any made-up characters, so whenever possible avoids using Eleanor or Beravor.

 

Given some of the comments above, about other potential characters, I think we need to be careful about drawing on tenuous amount of information to "find" existing characters that could be used. The woman who talks about the hands of the king being healing - fair enough for a low-cost ally, but a bit poor for a hero.

Galadriel as a hero or Goldberry as a powerful ally, would definitely be good at some point tho (Tom Bombadil or Goldberry as heroes would involve them wandering too far from home.)

the woman (IORETH) who is about when aragorn is healing is a bit of a daft creation of tolkien in my opinion (i found her to be rather funny in her ways and especially gandalfs words about her), and the way i read it, meant to be a bit of a nuisance, not any help, so i agree no hero material there (well i guess in her defense she is a healer, and gives good advice---ok so an ally)

goldberry as you state along with tom shouldnt leave their bounds, maybe an objective card?

weve always got lobellia sackville-baggins- should be fun to see how they put her in (again not hero material)

-im sorry. im really trying to be of more help to the OP. but you cant get what isnt there

Middle-Earth CCG had Ioreth as a character you could have in your party, though she usually just hung around Rivendell with Halbarad. ICE also added their own characters, there were at least two female elves for the hero player, few more Agents for Sauron. Goldberry and Lobelia were both allies, with Lobelia also having an Agent (hazard) version.

The 3 female hero's in this game are often used in many decks and I would argue that Eowyn is the best, well-rounded hero in the game against any quest deck.  They may not be getting much love from FFG, but LOTR is rich in powerful and epic female characters.  Evetually we will see Arwyn, Galadriel and maybe even Rosey Cotton.  Although the Lady of the Wood may not be a playable hero, but probably an ally, similar to Gandalf with powerful effects for a round.  But like I said, Eowyn rocks, she gets a lot of attention from me, I keep her exhausted as often as I can to score some progress.

Sweet.  Theres more people on this forum that couldn't disagree with you more.  If you experimented with her in a few decks, against multiple encounter decks and quests, you would probably see the value of the card.  If you need any tips or deck constructs with her, let me know.

trust me - booored will have experimented with her in decks, as we all have who've been here since core-infact me and booored had this discussion months ago which i started regarding her usefulness...i was back then experiementing with other combos and was beginning to break out of my eowyn phase

she isnt that great when it comes down to it, her 1 good point (and yes i used to think she was the sh*t too) is her 4 willpower, but there are far better ways now to quest, perhaps not until you have a few quests packs under you, but still more reliable ways

i used to use her in EVERY **** deck i made, and only now ive stopped do i win more

she is sort of the easy way to make a questing deck without using any combos- and yes combos can be used on her to effect, but it just is missing that juice that really makes a good deck

I think Eowyn is neither better nor worse than the majority of heroes. In fact, there are very few heroes that I feel stand out as either better or worse than the rest. I can't stand Denethor, for example, but I know other people really like him. Beravor seems to me like the clear winner, but you have to build a deck around her to take full advantage of the possibilities of card draw. Boromir's ability to ready whenever he wants is simply nuts, but unless you can ensure you benefit from it, it's not worth the threat increase.

That said, Eowyn excels at questing, as everyone knows, and one of the strongest, simplest decks to play through the initial cycle (and Khazad-dum) was a Rohan deck:

Heroes: Eowyn, Theodred, Dunhere (Starting threat: 25)

Allies: Snowbourn Scout x3, Westfold Horse-Breaker x3, Escort from Edoras x3, Gleowine x2, Miner of the Iron Hills x2, Daughter of the Nimrodel x2, Faramir x1, Eomund x3, Gandalf x3 (22)

Attachments: Dunedain Mark x3, Ancient Mathom x3, Steward of Gondor x3 (9)

Events: A Test of Will x3, Stand and Fight x3, Sneak Attack x3, Will of the West x2, Dwarven Tomb x3, The Galadhrim's Greeting x2, A Light in the Dark x3 (20)

With Eowyn and Theodred committed to questing, you could make lots of progress each turn, and Dunhere would take care of enemies in the staging area. Galadhrim's Greeting and Gandalf would drop your threat so that you didn't have to engage enemies, Dunedain Mark would boost Dunhere so he'd be strong enough to overcome defense strengths, and A Light in the Dark could force enemies that engaged you back into the staging area for Dunhere to attack. Without a Lore hero, the Lore allies need to be played by Stand and Fight, of course, but they each provide valuable, situational effects: card draw, condition removal, and healing.

It seems there were a lot of variants on this deck that saw play, each tweaking the core base by 5 cards or so, and Eowyn was crucial to all of them (as were Theodred and Dunhere). Low starting threat and high starting willpower are the core of the deck.

Agree 100% about Beravor. If your deck is designed for it she is just stupid, it is impossible to loose.

exactly , she is kind of like training wheels for new players. Allowing them to get a handle on one of the game play aspects early on. We all know that the hardest part of this game is the initial rounds b4 you get your allys out and she takes that pressure off, but as any Eowyn deck player will know that by mid and defiantly by end game you are questing for a billion times more than you need.. often over questing even. This means her abilities is completely useless, as she is now a wasted utility slot. Deck builders soon noticed this as the card pool grew that there are simple so many better options to replace her with, options that carry a useful function though out the entire course of the quest. While I still think she is good for noobs to get a handle on the game, once you are comfortable I strongly encourage you to swap her out and it will not be long till you are getting much better scores with out her and having more fun, as lets face it, questing isn't the coolest "trick" a card can do is it?

Eowyn is neither strong as some folks believe nor as weak as others maintain.  She is certainly not a requirement for solo deck building; However she is not simply a crutch for new players or weak deckbuilders.  She's very good at what she does - questing...not only with her strength but because her power gives her flexibility to provide variable quest strength - a nice feature in scenarios where you want to control the pace of your progress.   Get Faramir and Elfhelm in with her and questing by herself, with Faramir in support as needed, gives you the ability to deal with threat from 4-7.  She does this at a fairly low threat level as her other stats are weak...which is fine as she is a specialist.

To say that you can replace her questing prowess easily with card combos is correct but completely misses the point that by playing her you free up deck space to include combos to deal with other aspects of the game.  

Bottom line is that it's personal preference.

no, many people completely misunderstand this.... . the point is that in a deck that where she run by end or mid game she is irrelevant, as you simply do not need her questing ability in nay way. You could nvr tap her again and not notice a difference, so she becomes a empty slot, that you could run a card that has a valid effect till the end of the game. The argument that you can place other cards as that she frees up questing abilities in your of no consequence as you always end up with a deck that over quests due to card pool. There are a few scenarios that she is good in, Massing is one of them, due to the extreme start position in a solo game, but as any massing player knows as you add more players again this becomes less and less important.

I do foresee a time in the future once the card pool opens up more were she again will become relevant. A time were you can field many more specific spells with no aid to questing. In a deck like that you can rely on her ability for the entire game, but as it stands now there is simply not enough cards, no matter the combo of cards you always end up with a overly powerful quest deck.

Hey Boored - I understand your point.  I simply disagree with it.  Here's why:

1) Back of the envelope analysis - Eowyn is 4 quest power with 5 if needed and cards in hand;  This is at least the equivalent of sending 3 allies questing  (figuring 2, 2, 1 Will allies).  In general, I'm sending Eowyn rather than those 3 allies who are doing other things for me like defending, attacking or kicking off special abilities.  I'll take that trade.  Yes, you can send 2 and buff them with a combo to get there, but that leads to my second point...

2) I primarily play a Purple Blue deck (green splashed in to have a chance at JtR).  For a while I played some of the blue quest/quest bumping cards, but I've pretty much pulled them all - for the reason you state.  I don't need the questing allies or quest buffs.  Since I'm using allies, attachments and events for other elements, I usually don't have an overpowered quest deck.  Eowyn is usually the key questor for me through game's end.   I can concentrate on cards that give me attack, defense, threat management, versatility, etc.  Sure I've got the Stone but if you have Aragorn and blue in, you play it.  Faramir is great for questing bumps, but he's a rock solid ally.  Northern tracker is another rock solid ally who quests for reasons other than will.  Other than those 3 I don't think I have any in that relate to questing (I'll check the cards later). 

Long paragraph but in summary, I've got an Eowyn deck that does not do in most games (and I've probably played a couple hundred with it) what you say  will always happen.

3) She's a specialist so you do use her for a niche, making her fairly useless for other things.  However you can offset that by combining her with versatile heroes like Aragorn and Imrahil in my case.  Those heroes handle the other stuff and can complement questing if needed.  She makes a great 3rd with them.

4) Her ability scales up with multi player.  Add 1-3 questing power depending on players.  This can be critical when you are running with others that may have weak questing.

5) There are scenarios where her high and buffable will are important - She probably won't die in a snowstorm on Caradhras; She can help control the progress on CatC, great for final Escape tests in Dead Marshes, etc.

I was going to type up a detailed argument, but I will settle for "what Woz said."

im in the middle here

while i do not think her the supreme master of questing and all round solo play as arathorn was saying, hence my earlier reply, i still think she has alot of merit in my solo decks

i usually use her when paired with tactics and a heavy fighting deck, so that as woz says i have a good quester in a non-questing deck

this is evened out in the end then, as without a massive amount of willpower coming off one hero, it would be a questing-empty deck

the main reason i dont use her is because i sort of burned her out during last year when my strategies were crappy and i just had a very linear view of the game that barely utilised combos- so i used to think along the lines of - big questing card, big figting card, thats it.....whereas now im better at getting cards that work well together

well, maybe i am being a bit hard on her. I mean we have all used her. I just think that she has some real short falls in the utility dept. I like having all my heroes serve a function for the entire game. As I said I think she is going to get better as the card pool opens but for example... Bifur imo OWNS her... he only quest for 1 less with Dain on the field and has mana fixing and is lower threat.... and higher attack.... great example of a card (admittedly needing a support card.. but most people run dain when running dwarfism deck.. or probably should.)

When I am deck building, I focus heavily on ensuring that the deck can do well in both the mid/end game as well as the beginning. If you are searching for high scores, I could possibly understand your perspective. If you are aiming for win percentage, I couldn't disagree more. Heroes are the only way to guarantee early game capability, and the early game is the most critical time to survive/prosper. If you are depending on a card draw to decently quest or fight, you are wide open to a poor deck draw derailing the game quickly + you are further restricted on when to mulligan. A pool of capable heroes gives you longer to get your engine running and Eowyn makes this equation much simpler to the point that you can essentially pick any two other heroes and know that questing is covered early on. One of the things that makes Beravor so absurd is that she is so effective at being part of an engine in the mid/end game while also offering up solid questing and fighting at the beginning. You could make a similar argument for a few other heroes (Gloin comes to mind), but it is hard to imagine Eowyn not being at least a middle of the road hero.

Boored,

To be honest, I think your point is more of personal preference.  Nothing wrong with that.  I love the versatility and utility of Aragorn and Imrahil so I kinda play to that with the deck and let Eowyn do her thing.  First time we see a card that allows Will to be used for AT or Def instead or draw your will in cards/reduce your threat by the will of a hero - you get the point- she'll definitely jump in powers

Rich,

I understand your view.  I also have a couple other decks that I run with to give a bit of variety.  They play very differently, and I don't use the same hero in any of them - even if it results in a "sub optimal" line up.

Beano,

Good point.  I love the game - hate both scoring systems.  I only worry about Ws and Ls.
