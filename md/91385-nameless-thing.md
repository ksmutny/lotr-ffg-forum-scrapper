Sorry feel like I have been posting too much here lately. I have been through the forums here and at BGG and can't figure something out.

I am assuming that the cards attached to nameless thing go back to the player once the thing is killed but I can't see anywhere where this is spelled out. Even the Insert for Foundations of Stone doesn't mention it (which would have been helpful).

I assume they kind of act like guarded cards but I wanted to check on it to make sure we played it correctly.

Hmmm - now that we are playing it I can see a lot of these cards make you discard from your deck. So I am now guessing these attached cards go to the discard pile after you defeat the creature?

Yes, they go to the discard pile. The reason why there is no specific mention in the Foundations of Stone rules sheet is because the Core Set rules already handle this situation. Because these face up cards count as attachments, they are discarded to their owner's discard pile when the attached enemy leaves play.

The rules sheets that come in the packs often go over items in the core rules (mentioning certain mechanics for example) that are helpful towards understanding the quest. This would have been a good one to include IMHO.

Picky I know, but having the sentence "These cards count as an attachment" would have been helpful, as the rule you mention refers specifically to "Attachment" cards (which are in the 'card type' section of the card) and nowhere is it mentioned that these count as such.

We played it correct in the end I suppose.

An attachment is not limited to a card with the attachment type. For example, treacheries like "Caught in a Web" become attachments. Even though they have a card type of "Treachery" when they are revealed, they become Attachments after their effect successfully resolves. Anything that is currently acting as an attachment is always discarded when the card that it is attached to leaves play. Because the Nameless enemies uses the phase "attach" the cards from the top of your deck are acting like attachments, just as Caught in the Web does. I agree that this could have been more clear, but in general the game uses language very specifically to address ambiguities like this. Whenever you see the word "attach" the card that is being referenced will act as an "Attachment" and interacts with other cards in the game accordingly.
