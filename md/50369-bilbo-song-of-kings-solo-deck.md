This deck attempts to take the best of each sphere and make them into one deck with the use of Bilbo and Song of Kings.

Basic Break Down:

Eowyn: Quest and Quest and more questing for her

Bilbo: Quest or can defend till deck gets setup.

Thalin: Beat Stick of deck ( Choice Thalin sense he can wound minions while he quests and has a lower threat cost that allows the deck to have some time to set up before a troll hits or something else big)

I know there is a possible of getting clog with cards that can't be used but from the playing it the deck seems to come out in the end.

It beats 9 out of 10 times. Most of the higher place cards get played towards the middle or end of the game. The deck looks odd from the card list but ifonce you figure out how it works it can take on basically any situation out there. I will have to try the deck you post once I get a chance.
