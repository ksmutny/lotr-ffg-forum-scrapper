I still don't have the first box NM expansion.  I really need to get my LGS on the ball on this...

I seem to have missed the spoiler. At least the art. And art is one important! :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

Hobbit boxes are awful. These are the only NM quests I am not interested in buying.

Couldn't agree more but as a perfectionist and collector I'll have to buy them just so that I have them.... but will pretty much never play them. The first box was done so badly and the quests in the second box are crappy enough without nightmare, nightmare will only make them more frustrating. Also as much as I really hate the other 5 quests I LOVE the battle of five armies so am slightly keen to play the nm version.

So true... Dislike all but battle of five armies!

We Must Away Ere Break of Day... vast improvement over Conflict at the Carrock.  No random sacks and two paths to victory. Nuff said.

 

Over the Misty Mountains Grim... fairly easy quest, lots of little goblin to kill, which is right up my alley. 

 

Dungeons Deep and Caverns Dim, one of my top 5 quests to this day.  Had some very good experiences with this one.  Can be very challenging, and if you dislike the riddle mechanic then you'll hate the quest.  I love the drama though.  It's not random despite what people say, you make an educated guess about the composition of your own deck, that's about as close as you can mechanically get to simulating a riddle contest.  I even played a couple of games where my deck was almost uniform in composition-- Bilbo sailed through the riddling and we got to the last stage too early, got creamed because the dwarves weren't set up yet.  But fun times anyway.

 

Flies and Spiders... cool theme, moderate difficulty. Don't let Bilbo go unconscious and you're made.  Fun quest.

 

The Lonely Mountain... very unique quest.  Crows and a dragon are the only enemies you have to deal with, but oh what a dragon.  Problem is, this quest is also easy-- yes, you heard right.  Smaug is easy to break.  Rider of the Mark on each side of the table, and you can remove his shadow card thus guaranteeing only a single attack, when he is attacking at all.  At that point the quest is trivial to defeat.  I like this one for the flavor, but don't play it too often.

 

Battle of the Five Armies... definitely my favorite of all of the "big battle" themed quests, but still I rarely play this one.  Battles are not my thing, and although they occupy a prominent place in the Lord of the Rings itself, large scale battles are not what the quest of the ring is about.  I'm in love with quests like Shadow of the Past and Fog on the Barrow-Downs, battles are fun sometimes but like I said not the most memorable quests for me.  That said, BotFA is my favorite as it's a moderate-high difficulty level for me and I like it when eagles pop out of the encounter deck :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Gotta disagree wholeheartedly here.

Conflict is two trillion billion million times better than We Must Away.

Much prefer random sacks to completely unavoidable overpowered sacks RIGHT when you have to face three trolls. Removing them costs too much and is too difficult as well (should be able to do it whether troll camp is in staging or not, if you dont keep/save one in staging you're just screwed....)

The effect that only lets one character attack trolls at a time is just insanely stupid. 

if you have a high enough willpower deck and low enough threat you can just quest and turn them to stone and not actually face any trolls which although thematic means you dont actually have to bring decent combat cards/decks to the table. 

Don't even get me started on the nightmare version of this quest...... Mince them Fine is the stupidest encounter card ever made.

 

Forgot about Over the Misty Mountains, that quest actually isn't bad at all, neither is the nightmare version and I like defeating the Great Goblin.

About ruddle quest:

I like it. Really unique quest and nmode make it much more interesting. I know many players hate this quest but this quest one of my favorite!
