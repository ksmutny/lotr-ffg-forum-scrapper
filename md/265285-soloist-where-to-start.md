I would like to get into this game, the physical game incase it needs to be clarified.  I will likely be playing solo.  What would you recommend I get after the core set?

Few, if any, could give you better advice than the author of the blog Tales from the cards:

In addition to the New Player Buying Guide that Freeman linked, I'd also bookmark the Lord of the Rings LCG Quest Companion [http://lotr-lcg-quest-companion.com/home.html].  In particular, the Player Difficulty ratings are a bit more reliable than the Official Difficulty ratings.

Just always remember that to play a quest from an adventure pack requires the corresponding Deluxe expansion.  So it doesn't make much sense to buy (for instance) Escape from Mount Gram without buying The Lost Realm, unless you just really want that Veteran of Osgiliath, and don't care at all about playing the quest!

If you're interested, I'm working on a blog series that analyzes how the game plays when you buy expansions out of release order:

Hey, I just started a few weeks ago, and I ended up buying Khazad-Dum after the core set, and then Return to Mirkwood AP for Dain Ironfoot(holy heck he feels like cheating).  That has worked pretty well for me.  I feel like I can reliably beat the first quest in Khazad-Dum, and I'm going to go back and try Escape from Dol Goldur for my first foray into two-handing it.

 

The hard part is not just buying a ton of stuff so I have a ton more cards to play with.  I'm trying to stick to beating quests with only the cards that were available when the particular quest came out.

 Hello, all.  Progress report time.  I have obtained Khazad-Dum and the first pack in that cycle.  I really like the idea of a Dwarven Armory deck.  The problem that I have been encountering is dealing with locations and questing.  Is there any pack that has a Tactics hero with good Willpower?  I do appreciate the help I have been given so far.

These cards are your friends for Tactics Questing. There's also a card that gives the current quest the Battle keyword, which means you quest using Attack instead of Willpower, but you need a mono-Tactics deck and is harder to make work.

Proxy yourself 3x Wait No Longer. Makes a huge difference to Tactics decks ability to quest, especially when playing solo.

Agreed. Also proxy in 3X Open the Armory and 3X Sterner than Steel.
