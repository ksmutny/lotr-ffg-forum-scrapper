Looks like March it is then.

 

Nice article, though.

Nothing much new in here. Even Nate's analysis of the game (the 3 aspects of questing, attacking and defending versus the 3 heroes, etc.) wasn't anything we didn't knew about. Still makes for an interesting read and the fact that they are going with more "strategy" articles (coming after Boromir's Guide the last few weeks) is nice. I assume the article (and I believe the subsequent ones will do it more) answers some questions new players may have; didn't we just have a new post a couple days ago about which sphere combinations work best together?

Sad news is, I think the reference to a the new hero being presented in 2 weeks mean we won't have the next AP before March. Too bad; I'm also a junky eagerly awaiting my fix of new cards and quests. And even worse, it could also mean there will be no new preview for the next two weeks...

 Yeah, as a new player I benefited from Nate's ramblings on The Rule of Three.

No, they said next week they're going to talk about Secrecy, so I assume we'll see some of the Redhorn Gate cards, and then in two weeks we'll see the hero from Redhorn! Sweet! I hope it's one of Elrond's sons! Also, the reveal of the hero usually comes right before it's released so hopefully on the 1st or 2nd of March.

That's excellent news.
I won't keep my hopes high, but getting my hands on this AP before my classes starts will be awesome.

FFG releases these packs to fast imo. In a game like CoC or aGoT or w/e it doesn't matter as you are just getting playing cards and then amending your decks and making new ones.. but I have hardly played though the shadow of mirkwood quests let alone played Khaz much.. I mean how many times have you guys played say the 7th level? They are coming out way to fast imo... like I do not care. i'll just buy them at my own pace.. but I just do nto get the rush to get Darowdelf.. how can you have gotten your fill of Khaz yet?

I never played Khazad-Dum...
That's the reason I want Redhorn Gate, they're both in the same parcel.

 

The good thing is, if they make dwarrodelf available today, you won't buy it; but many people will. If they wait four weeks, you may still not buy it; so what's the point? I can't see how that's a problem for people who WANT the new cycle. I'm not bored (no pun intended) with 'old' quests, heck, I only played Return TWICE! But I'm never tired of seeing new stuff; hence the reason I already have 6 custom quests.

 

Of course, there is the fact that I bought the entire Mirkwood cycle at once, so I'm not used to wait that long to discover and play a new quest, maybe I'll need more patience from now on.

 

TL;DR: I WANT MORE HEROES! sad.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sad.gif]

I still believe we will be able to purchase Redhorn Gate before March.

I always want more player cards, but when I get them I have a hard time keeping my deck down in the 50-60 card range. Still, I want more new player cards.
