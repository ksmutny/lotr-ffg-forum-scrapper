# [Playing 200 games in a year (or at least trying to)](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/)

## 1 [silverthorn on March 19, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1018885)

In order to get away from spending a lot more time deck building than actually playing LOTR I decided to challenge myself to play the game two hundred times in a year. I decided to start with the Hobbit quests using a all-Dwarf deck comprising Balin, Nori & Thorin Oakenshild alongside another deck consisting of Legolas, Mirlonde and Beorn (until another Silvan hero is released).

 

GAME ONE - WE MUST AWAY ERE BREAK OF DAY

 

The game was a success (although the ally body count was astronomical) and all the booty was collected from the Troll Cave. Points totals were as follows:

THE DWARVES: Threat Level: 41 + Threat From Dead Heroes: 0 +Damage on surviving heroes: 0 - Victory Points: 14 +Rounds (6) x10: 60. Total: 87.

THE NON-DWARVES: Threat Level: 41 + Threat From Dead Heroes: + Damage on surviving heroes: 3 - Victory Points: 14 +Rounds (6) x10: 60. Total: 90.

Go for 300 games!

I'd be scared to know how many times I've played over a year. :o [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_ohmy.png]

I keep a spreadsheet of my victories and losses, so I've got a record of almost every game I've ever played... right now it's sitting at 355, and I've been playing for just over two years.  So 200 a year is not in my league and this is a goal I can root for -- go for it silverthorn!

I usually play 3 or 4 times for a day..., so: 3'5 x 365 days: lol

Thats pretty good!

 

I have not played this for a year yet so I do not know if I can do 300, or 200 games, but Im sure I can definitely do 200 games once a year has came around. Sounds like a fun challenge!

 

I started playing in December and my current record is at 53 games so far. May do one more before I go to bed.

Why single people doesn't think about this game. Only after you have married and have kids? lol

## 10 [silverthorn on March 20, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1020103)

I've played a lot of LOTR since I first posted (since I'm going to have a lot less time to play for most of April I'm getting as much questing in as possible). Thanks for the encouragement.

GAME TWO - OVER THE MISTY MOUNTAINS GRIM (ATTEMPT ONE).

A complete failure, nothing more to say. Move along.

GAME THREE - OVER THE MISTY MOUNTAINS GRIM (ATTEMPT TWO).

More succesful, Legolas killed a lot of goblins (and I was glad that I swapped three copies of Mighty Prowess into my Elf heavy deck when all the Gobbos turned up). The final points totals were as follows.

DWARVES Threat Level: 46. Dead Hero Threat: 0. Damage on Surviving Heroes: 4. Victory Points: 3. Rounds (5): 50. Total: 97.
NON-DWARVES: Threat Level: 49. Dead Hero Threat: 0. Damage on Surviving Heroes: 3. Victory Points: 3. Rounds (5): 50. Total: 99.

GAME FOUR - DUNGEONS DEEP AND CAVERNS DIM

This was more down to luck than anything else but a win's a win. Points Totals were as follows:
DWARVES Threat Level: 35. Dead Hero Threat: 0. Damage on Surviving Heroes: 0. Victory Points: 1. Rounds (9): 90. Total: 124.
NON-DWARVES: Threat Level: 42. Dead Hero Threat: 0. Damage on Surviving Heroes: 0. Victory Points: 1. Rounds (9): 90. Total: 131.

GAME FIVE - FLIES AND SPIDERS

Again, a game where Legolas turned the tide, adding a ridiculous amount of Progress Tokens by killing an industrial amount of Spiders. Points Values were as follows:
DWARVES Threat Level: 32. Dead Hero Threat: 0. Damage on Surviving Heroes: 5. Victory Points: 0. Rounds (10): 100. Total: 137.
NON-DWARVES: Threat Level: 37. Dead Hero Threat: 0. Damage on Surviving Heroes: 8 (all on Beorn, that bear-man can take a truly unfeasable amount of hurt). Victory Points: 0. Rounds (10): 100. Total: 145.

GAME SIX - THE LONELY MOUNTAIN

A game won by nothing more than excessive amounts of jammy luck. By the time I had finished the Elves had hit 50 threat two turns before, the last hero standing was Balin and I would have been fubar'd if I had drawn badly on the last Quest Phase. Points Values were as follows:
DWARVES Threat Level: 48. Dead Hero Threat: 21. Damage on Surviving Heroes: 5. (Balin had Citadel Plate on him) Victory Points: 10. Rounds (11): 110. Total: 174.
NON-DWARVES: Failed to complete game.

As an aside, I have noticed that Legolas has been MVP in pretty much every game (he killed Smaug in Lonely Mountain using the Black Arrow on the turn before the Elves hit 50 threat). He's a absolute beast when the killing starts.

Wait what? Could you maybe try and rephrase that?

Sorry, but I can't seem to make out what you mean by this.

I think he means that putting time into this game is easier when you are single, as compared to having a wife, and kids (aka time consumers).

Yes, true.

 

And it is a little joke, but really: when people are single, they don't know the game; when are married, then they find out it.

## 14 [tacomen253 on March 21, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1021394)

I get what you are saying. I think it is because Lord of the Rings has been around for such a long time that it appeals to a range of age groups; the Hobbit novel first came out in 1937. This card game only has been around for what, a few years now?

## 15 [silverthorn on March 21, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1021408)

GAME SEVEN - BATTLE OF FIVE ARMIES (ATTEMPT ONE)

Game lost due to losing all my heroes to a ridiculous amount of Orcs.

GAME EIGHT - BATTLE OF FIVE ARMIES (ATTEMPT TWO)

More of the above.

GAME NINE - BATTLE OF FIVE ARMIES (ATTEMPT ONE)

Finally managed to beat the mission (one part a lot more luck as far as Shadow draws go, one part managing to get all of the healing related cards into play early). Ponts Totals were as follows:

DWARVES: Threat Level: 36, Dad Hero Threat Level: 0, Damage on surviving heroes: 9, Victory Points: 1, Turns (9): 90, Total: 134.
NON-DWARVES: Threat Level: 37, Dad Hero Threat Level: 0, Damage on surviving heroes: 9, Victory Points: 1, Turns (9): 90, Total: 135.

Having completed the Hobbit Saga Expansions I wanted to make some changes to my decks for the quests set fifty-odd years since two thirds of the heroes in my Dwarf deck died at the Battle of Five Armies or in Moria. I changed the decks to a Lore & Spirit deck consisting of Aragorn, Eowyn and Glorfindel and a Leadership & Tactics deck consisting of Beorn (presumably being a were-bear made him longer-living than average), Legolas and Theodred (mostly just to keep the threat level under 30).

With new decks to fine-tune I readied myself for the Nightmare decks.

GAME TEN - PASSAGE THROUGH MIRKWOOD (NIGHTMARE)

This was much harder than I expected (I know, the clue is in the name of the difficulty level). If it hadn't been for the two Blades of Gondolin on Legolas I would have been swamped by the amount of Locations in play.The new decks worked well, although differently to the old decks. Although he was included for his low Threat Value, Theodred managed to keep the resources flowing whilst ensuring several drawn Quest Phases after the locations started to mount up. Points Totals were as follows:

LEADERSHIP & TACTICS: Threat Level: 43, Dead Hero Threat: 0, Damage on surviving heroes: 0 (I had five healers out at one point healing for all it was worth), Victory Points: 4, Turns (6): 60, Total: 99.
LORE & SPIRIT: Threat Level: 27 (I used Aragorn's ability on the last turn to drop the decks threat from 47 to 26), Dead Hero Threat: 0, Damage on surviving heroes: 0, Victory Points: 4, Turns (6): 60, Total: 83.

Me too. I found the game then I'am married.

 

But I don't think it is to time consuming. The the Kids are in bed and my wife is watching TV, I sit at the diner table and play the game. I can chat with my wife than I do so - so I play rather than watching TV and I have enough time. I play now for 4 months and have played 166 Games. So 200 in a year will work.

GAME 11 - JOURNEY DOWN THE ANDUIN (NIGHTMARE)

A mission which was less complicated than I had expected, mostly due to having probably the two best starting hands I've managed to get since I started this challenge. Points Totals were as follows:

LORE & SPIRIT: Threat Level: 37, Dead Hero Threat: 0, Damage: 4, VP: 0, Turns (5): 50, Total: 91.
LEADERSHIP & TACTICS: Threat Level: 39, Dead Hero Threat: 0, Damage: 1, VP: 0, Turns (5): 50, Total: 90.

GAME 12 - ESCAPE FROM DOL GOLDUR (NIGHTMARE) TRY ONE

A total loss, Eowyn being the prisoner meant that I was questing for so little that I was swamped withing five turns.

GAME 13 - ESCAPE FROM DOL GOLDUR (NIGHTMARE) TRY TWO

Again, swamped (this time due to Beorn being captured).

GAME 14 - ESCAPE FROM DOL GOLDUR (NIGHTMARE) TRY THREE

Two rebuilt decks (along with Theodred being captured) meant that I managed to grind out a win at last. Points Totals were as follows:

LORE & SPIRIT: Threat Level: 40, Dead Hero Threat: 0, Damage: 11, VP: 0, Turns (7): 70, Total: 121.
LEADERSHIP & TACTICS: Threat Level: 44, Dead Hero Threat: 0, Damage: 15, VP: 0, Turns (7): 70, Total: 129.

GAME 15 - HUNT FOR GOLLUM (NIGHTMARE)

Managed to win the game with one Clue card in play (due to a combination of Legolas with Blade of Gondolin killing a lot of enemies before I could get through too much of the Encounter deck). Points Totals were as follows:

LORE & SPIRIT: Threat Level: 32, Dead Hero Threat: 0, Damage: 2, VP: 0, Turns (6): 60, Total: 94.
LEADERSHIP & TACTICS: Threat Level: 35, Dead Hero Threat: 0, Damage: 0, VP: 0, Turns (60): , Total: 95.

GAME 16 - CONFLICT AT THE CARROCK (NIGHTMARE) TRY ONE

Failed, everyone was killed by Trolls, basically anything which could go wrong did go wrong.

GAME 17 - CONFLICT AT THE CARROCK (NIGHTMARE) TRY TWO

Completely diffferent from last time, I managed to avoid Trolls before hitting Stage 2 and just managed to scrape a win with casualties (Glorfindel and Theodred) after avoiding my Lore and Spirit deck threating out by remembering to use Aragorn's ability (I'm used to using Leadership Aragorn more than Loragorn). Points Totals were as follows:

LORE & SPIRIT: Threat Level: 27, Dead Hero Threat: 5, Damage: 6, VP: 20, Turns (7): 70, Total: 88.
LEADERSHIP & TACTICS: Threat Level: 49, Dead Hero Threat: 8, Damage: 9, VP: 20, Turns (7): 70, Total: 116.

GAME 18 - A JOURNEY TO RHOSGOBEL (NIGHTMARE)

An interesting quest where I burned through all of my healing-related cards and had to hope that I could get a third Athelas before I completed Phase 2. Thankfully I managed to gain the third Athelas on the turn that Legolas killed a goblin and provided the Progress to complete Phase 2. Wilyador had 15 wounds which were just removed by the Athelas gaining me the win. Points values were as follows:

LORE & SPIRIT: Threat Level: 31, Dead Hero Threat: 0, Damage: 2, VP: 4, Turns (5): 50, Total: 87.
LEADERSHIP & TACTICS: Threat Level: 31, Dead Hero Threat: 0, Damage: 0, VP: 4, Turns (5): 50, Total: 85.

GAME 19 - HILLS OF EMYN MUIL

After all the Nightmare quests I was glad to be back to standard difficulty. This was a quest where I was thankful for getting a Asfaloth in my starting hand because he/she was instrumental in blowing through enough locations to complete the quest. One of the few quests where Legolas was not the MVP (Glorfindel took the honors). Points values were as follows:

LORE & SPIRIT: Threat Level: 40, Dead Hero Threat: 0, Damage: 2, VP: 21, Turns (9): 90, Total: 111.
LEADERSHIP & TACTICS: Threat Level: 32, Dead Hero Threat: 0, Damage: 7, VP: 21, Turns (9): , Total: 108.

GAME 20 - THE DEAD MARSHES

Again, a game where the double act of Beorn and Legolas were killing enough enemies to counter the amount of locations which were coming into play. Points values were as follows:

LORE & SPIRIT: Threat Level: 32, Dead Hero Threat: 0, Damage: 0, VP: 7, Turns (6): 60, Total: 85.
LEADERSHIP & TACTICS: Threat Level: 32, Dead Hero Threat: 0, Damage: 3, VP: 7, Turns (6): 60, Total: 88.

GAME 21 - RETURN TO MIRKWOOD

Beorn, Legolas and Theodred were mostly guarding Gollum (thanks to Beorn's ability to defend all day long). Points values were as follows:

LORE & SPIRIT: Threat Level: 39, Dead Hero Threat: 0, Damage: 4, VP: 0, Turns (8): 80, Total: 118.
LEADERSHIP & TACTICS: Threat Level: 44, Dead Hero Threat: 0, Damage: 0, VP: 0, Turns (8): 80, Total: 124.

After finishing Return to Mirkwood I changed the Leadership/Tactics deck to remove all the Eagles and Eagle-related cards (for various not being able to fit underground relared reasons, the were-bear is bad enough), the Lore and Spirit deck didn't need any alterations. Anyway, onward to Dwarrowdelf.

## 19 [silverthorn on March 25, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1025980)

After further consideration I decided to make more substantial changes to the decks. Eowyn & Theodred have returned to Rohan, replaced by Beravor (joining Aragorn and Glorfindel) and Prince Imrahil (joining Beorn & Legolas in a deck with a large number of chump blockers so that Imrahil can hopefully quest and attack in the same round). the only sticking point is the high starting threat but hopefully I'll draw threat reduction cards quickly.

Yes, i also started playing this about 3 years ago right around same time my son was born. Yeah that was a super busy time, but there was plenty of time to get some playing in when Mom and baby were doing their thing. Now, he is going to bed pretty ealry (most of the time) and most of the night is free, so i can usually get some playing in each day.

I'd say this is such a great game for new Dads that it should come with the baby. You probably will not get much playing in right away, but in a few months it's the perfect time filler if you like gaming, and can't get out much to do it at the time.

This game needs lot of time. I am a gamer of lots of games. And since i knew LOTR, i onlly play it, no time for other games.

GAME 21 - INTO THE PIT (ATTEMPT ONE)

A resounding failure. After losing Aragorn in turn one to a Sudden Pitfall shadow draw there was no recovery. Both decks hit 50 threat by turn 7.

GAME 22 - INTO THE PIT (ATTEMPT TWO)

More succesful. Pretty much everything went to plan. Prince Imrahil was a lot more useful than Theodred ever was (He was mostly just accumulating more resources than I could spend with the Leadership cards in the deck at the time) and the Ranger-ish deck did what it was meant to do, having two Lore heroes in play meant that I was playing certain important cards a lot faster (especially with a Song of Wisdom in my opening hand). Points values were as follws:

LORE & SPIRIT: Threat Level: 39, Dead Hero Threat: 0, Damage: 0, VP: 4, Turns (6): 60, Total: 95.
LEADERSHIP & TACTICS: Threat Level: 42, Dead Hero Threat: 0, Damage: 5 (all on Beorn), VP: 4, Turns (60): , Total: 103.

22 games in a week.  Keep this up and you will accomplish 200 games in under 3 months my friend.

> 22 games in a week.  Keep this up and you will accomplish 200 games in under 3 months my friend.

 

I'm going to be playing a lot less for about a month from next week, added to a agreement I made with a newly found group of fellow players which means that I'm having to build a deck for solo and multi-player play (sometimes we play the scenario solo, sometimes we play multi-player). 

 

We decided that, rather than everyone turning up with the same heroes (the night where four players turned up with decks featuring Spirit Glorfindel apparently being a shining example) everyone would draw a race/faction at random from a hat and build a deck based on that. After being stupid enough to agree to that I drew Dwarves out of the hat. It's a long time since I played anything other than two-handed so it's a uphill struggle working out which heroes to put in the deck.

> everyone would draw a race/faction at random from a hat and build a deck based on that. 

 

hah, I actually like this idea.  You might get something like dwarves, which essentially builds itself, but what if you get shafted and have to build a deck that focuses on Silvan? (in its current game state)  You could do it but you won't reach the power level of other archetypes... could make for a fun deckbuilding challenge.

I received a phone call from one of the other players, it turns out he's only played Dwarves since the game started and he was wanting to know if I would swap races with him. Since I've built a few Dwarf decks over the years (with, admittedly, low levels of success) so I agreed. As a result I'm building a Gondor-based deck (A deck type I haven't tried since the Dwarrowdelf cycle). With a little luck I should play a game at some point tonight.

If you want a lot of game a suggestion is to do Into Ithilien with a deck that is not ready to battle quest... Your games will take 2-3 minutes and you can get 30-40 games in in just a few hours... ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] seriously good luck.

After building a Gandor-themed deck I decided to go back to the Core Set quests and play them through solo.

GAME - PASSAGE THROUGH MIRKWOOD (NIGHTMARE) TRY ONE
Heroes: Beregond, Boromir (Tactics), Eleanor.

I had the major problem that I was not generating enough Willpower to counter the locations coming into play. I was swamped and hit 50 threats on turn 7. After this I went back to the drawing board.

GAME - PASSAGE THROUGH MIRKWOOD (NIGHTMARE) TRY TWO
Heroes: Boromir (Leadership), Eleanor, Prince Imrahil.
MVP: Prince Imrahil (I managed to maintain a steady string of dead allies so that he could quest and attack in most rounds).

This deck went a lot better than the Tactics/Spirit deck. I was generating a lot of resources and managed to beat Ungoliant's Spawn for the win on turn seven.

Threat Level: 35
Dead Hero Threat: 0
Damage: 4
VP: 0
Turns (7): 70
Total: 109

## 29 [silverthorn on March 30, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1032099)

GAME 25 - JOURNEY DOWN THE ANDUIN (NIGHTMARE) TRY ONE

 

Heroes: Boromir (Leadership), Eleanor, Prince Imrahil

A complete failure. The Troll was adding so much Threat by killing chump blockers that my threat hit 49 by the time I killed the troll.

 

GAME 26 - JOURNEY DOWN THE ANDUIN (NIGHTMARE) TRY TWO

 

Heroes: Boromir (Leadership), Hirluin the Fair, Prince Imrahil.

This, not strictly all-Gondor deck went better than the last effort. Thanks to putting Steward of Gondor on Hirluin on turn one I was putting a large number of Outlands characters into play and using Lord of Murthond to get extra card draws. Regardless I ran out of threat on Phase 3B.

I can see the reason of your failures here. You take two extremely high threat heroes on Anduin - Boromir and Imrahil. You want to keep your threat as low as possible to prevent early engagements.

As I said, I'm playing less games (and getting really sick of trying to build a working Gondor deck).

 

GAME 27 - JOURNEY DOWN THE ANDUIN (NIGHTMARE) TRY THREE

Heroes: Beregond, Denethor, Faramir

Suffered from being unable to kill the Troll fast enough due to drawing six straight enemies in a row. I decided to go with a two-tactics, one lore deck next time.

 

GAME 28 - JOURNEY DOWN THE ANDUIN (NIGHTMARE) TRY FOUR

Heroes: Beregond, Bifur, Boromir

This deck worked better than the other decks (probably due to the fact that I had turn or two more to prepare for the Hill Troll), although I lost due to a bad set of draws from my deck.

Try to build the deck around quick resource acceleration and card draw with a low threat. Strong heroes are good, but you need an army to win this. And strong heroes attract too much attention too early.

Have you gone back two handed solo? Pure solo is

Boring and you don't see the full effect for the encounter deck and make use of works like ranges and sentinel

After another meeting with the other players we had to go back to the drawing board as far as who was building which decks. The plan is to play through all the Lord of the Rings Saga quests as a group with each deck having at least one member of the Fellowship in it (one Hobbit deck (with Sam, Merry & Pippin), one Dwarf deck, one Silvan/Noldor deck, one Dunedain/Noldor deck with Aragorn, Elladan & Elrohir and a Gondor-based deck).

 

We decided to wotk out which types of deck we had rarely or never played before. As a result, due to the fact that I spent a whole lot of time building decks instead of playing, I agreed to build a Hobbit based deck (as soon as I work out how to do a tri-sphere Leadership-Spirit-Tactics deck). Due to the fact that they are well, how can I put this, Hobbits I'm going to build a all-Lore deck to work with it and go back to playing two-handed.

GAME 29 - PASSAGE THROUGH MIRKWOOD

 

Heroes - The Hobbits:Merry, Pippin (Lore), Samwise Gamgee.

Heroes - The Non-Hobbits: Beorn, Eowyn, Legolas.

 

This worked better than I expected, I loaded the Hobbit deck with mostly 0 or 1 cost cards and let Beorn defend most of the damage heading the Hobbits way. With Sam and Eowyn questing for 7 on turn one the game went fairly smoothly. After turn six the game ended with the Hobbits scoring 89 and the non-hobbits scoring 98.

GAME 30 - JOURNEY DOWN THE ANDUIN

 

Heroes - The Hobbits:Merry, Pippin (Lore), Samwise Gamgee.

Heroes - The Non-Hobbits: Beorn, Eowyn, Legolas.

 

Again, the decks worked well together, the extra three turns which Pippin gave against the Troll gave me time to equip Legolas with a Black Arrow and Hand Upon The Bow allowing me to do massive amounts of damage to the Troll before he could attack anyone). Again the Hobbits came out ahead, 87 to 103.

 

GAME 31 - ESCAPE FROM DOL GOLDUR

 

Heroes - The Hobbits:Merry, Pippin (Lore), Samwise Gamgee.

Heroes - The Non-Hobbits: Beorn, Eowyn, Legolas.

 

Merry was the prisoner and the game was a much harder struggle than the first two quests. Beorn was killed by the Nazgul in order for Merry, Pippin, Sam and Legolas to team up to kill him. The Hobbits came out ahead again 119 to 137 (the 20 starting threat is much more useful than I would have thought)

GAME 32 - THE WATCHER IN THE WATER (I got sick of playing quests I've just been through so I decided to jump to untried quests, bypassing Road to Rivendell because that's the only pack I don't have).

 

Heroes - The Hobbits:Merry, Pippin (Lore), Samwise Gamgee.

Heroes - The Non-Hobbits: Beorn, Eowyn, Legolas.

 

This went remarkably well, I don't think I've ever had such a good pair of starting hands in the same game before. Due to a low-danger set of Encounter draws (apart from an unfortunate turn one Disturbed Waters) the quest was completed by turn five with the Hobbits scoring 76 and the non-hobbits 90.

## 38 [silverthorn on April 13, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1047396)

GAME 33 - A SHADOW OF THE PAST

 

Again, leaving my standard plan for a five-player run through The Black Riders. My notes are a little less studious than normal since I was a little overwhelmed by playing five-player LOTR.

 

Heroes

Team Hobbit (also known as me): Merry, Pippin (Lore), Sam Gamgee.

Team Aragorn: Aragorn (Lore), Beravor, Glorfindel (Spirit).

Team Boromir: Beregond, Boromir (Leadership), Prince Imrahil.

Team Gimli: Gimli, Nori, Thalin,

Team Legolas: Elladan, Elrohir, Legolas.

 

The game was, to say the least, chaotic. There was a few close calls for my characters but the assembled heroes managed to get Frodo to the ferry. The one thing I noticed was that a few of my fellows were glad that I took the Pippin who increases Engagement Costs due to high starting threats.

 

GAME 34 - A KNIFE IN THE DARK

 

Heroes same as before.

 

Again, everything went by in a blur due to my lack of experience of playing with more than two players. Regardless everyone survived and Merry became a warrior.

 

GAME 35 - FLIGHT TO THE FORD

 

Heroes same as before.

 

This was a challenge, While my hobbits made it to Rivendell unscathed, Thalin and Beravor fell in the effort. As such, things will be more complicated whenever The Road Darkens gets released (I'm starting to think that starting threat levels could increase to a stupid extent in five player run-throughs just due to the sheer amount of characters in play at one time).

 

Upon returning from the group I had enough time to squeeze in a less insane game:

 

GAME 36 - THE LONG DARK

 

Heroes - The Hobbits:Merry, Pippin (Lore), Samwise Gamgee.

Heroes - The Non-Hobbits: Beorn, Eowyn, Legolas.

 

This was, again, less of a challenge than I was expecting. The hero combination seems to be working well together. The hobbits won 74 points to 85.

## 39 [silverthorn on April 13, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1047755)

GAME 37 - FOUNDATIONS OF STONE

 

Heroes - The Hobbits:Merry, Pippin (Lore), Samwise Gamgee.

Heroes - The Non-Hobbits: Beorn, Eowyn, Legolas.

 

This was tough, Merry & Pippin were lost and every other hero was low on Hit Points by the time I finished the quest.

 

GAME 38 - SHADOW AND FLAME

 

Heroes - The Hobbits:Merry, Pippin (Lore), Samwise Gamgee.

Heroes - The Non-Hobbits: Beorn, Eowyn, Legolas.

 

If the last quest was tough, this was a blood bath. By the time I managed to use the Dark Pit's ability to get rid of the Balrog, the only heroes left standing were Merry and Beorn (on one hit point).

I'm going to have to rebuild my decks since it turns out I've been playing Beorn all kinds of wrong and I think the all-Hobbit deck may be kept for when I'm playing the LOTR Saga scenarios (since the Spirit/Tactics deck does all the work).

## 41 [silverthorn on April 15, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1050466)

After much consideration I decided to change my decks to a Spirit/Tactics deck consisting of Beregond, Eowyn & Legolas and a Leadership & Lore deck comprising Elrond, Hirluin the Fair & Mirlonde.

I also keep a spreadsheet of all my games and I just passed the One Thousand mark! In three years of playing that's 335 per year!

Since I've finally got the time to get some industrial scale questing in I've got some more questing under my belt.

 

GAME 39 - PERIL IN PELAGIR

 

Heroes: Elrond, Hirluin & Mirlonde and Berogond, Eowyn & Legolas.

 

This game went well. The new decks seemed to gel together well and between Elrond and Hirluin I was bringing out a ridiculous amount of Outlands guys. The quest was won after six turns with Elrond and company scoring 109 (after losing Mirlonde) and Legolas's team scoring 105.

 

GAME 40 - INTO ITHILIEN

 

Heroes: Elrond, Hirluin & Mirlonde and Berogond, Eowyn & Legolas.

 

If the last game went well, this one went even better. By turn two Elrond had Vilya & Unexpected Courage on him meaning that I was litterally running out of space for Elrond's company's allies. Added to Eagles entering play at the right time everything was good. The game took eight turns with Elrond's company scorring 119 to Legolas's company's 122.

 

GAME 41 - SIEGE OF CAIR ANDROS

 

Heroes: Elrond, Hirluin & Mirlonde and Berogond, Eowyn & Legolas.

 

If anything this game went better than the last two, either the decks are really working or I'm due a major case of bad luck. None of the heroes came out of the game uninjured but the quest was accomplished in eight turns with Elrond's company scoring 111 to Legolas's company's 112.

 

GAME 42 - THE STEWARD'S FEAR

 

Heroes: Elrond, Hirluin & Mirlonde and Berogond, Eowyn & Legolas.

 

My luck continued to hold as this quest again went well (despite Hirluin dying early on). The quest was completed on turn five with Legolas's company scoring 85 to Elrond's company's 97.

## 44 [silverthorn on May 11, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1080597)

I've finally got a lot more time to spend on trying to reclaim the time I've lost over the last few weeks. I decided to change the deck to a solo deck consisting of Aragorn (Lore), Faramir and Glorfindel (Spirit).

 

GAME 43 - PASSAGE THROUGH MIRKWOOD (NIGHTMARE)

Heroes: Aragorn (Lore), Faramir and Glorfindel (Spirit).

Result: Win (Threat Level: 28 (I  was on 9 progress on stage 3B so I used Loragorn's ability. Dead Hero Threat: 0. Damage: 0 (I had four healers out by the end of the game. Victory Points: 4 (Chieftain Ufthank). Turns: 12. Total Points: 144).

My progress was hampered by drawing a ridiculous amount of locations and the fact that I only drew 4 Spirit cards all game (2 Lights of Valinor, thankfully one in my starting hand, and 2 Escorts from Edoras). All in all a interesting, if slow start with the new deck.

## 45 [silverthorn on May 12, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1081386)

GAME 44 TO 46 - JOURNEY DOWN THE ANDUIN (NIGHTMARE) ATTEMPTS ONE THROUGH THREE

Heroes: Aragorn (Lore), Faramir and Glorfindel (Spirit).

Result: Three straight losses, the combination of heroes and allies can't kill the Troll so I'm going back to basics.

Tonight or tomorrow morning I'm going to really nail some quests, I've spend too much money vs not enough time for this game so far. But I'm going to make a deck and just have fun with it. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

That was the basic idea behind the 200 games in a year challenge, I spent 95% of my time building decks and 5% playing the game. I'll be able to get back to playing games on Wednesday or Thursday since a friend of mine ordered Road to Rivendell (the only non-POD set I managed to miss) off a prominent internet auction site for me so I'll be building a deck using Elladan and Elrohir as soon as that arrives.

GAME 47 - PASSAGE THROUGH MIRKWOOD (NIGHTMARE)... again.

Heroes: Aragorn (Lore), Beravor & Glorfindel. Elladan, Elrohir & Legolas.

 

The two decks worked well first time out despite losing the first quest phase by 5. The cards in Road To Rivendell were a revelation (Putting Blade of Gondolin and Rivendell Blade on Legolas made him a absolute monster) and the twins synergised well together. The game was completed on turn 6 and Aragorn's team only just beat Legolas's team 96 to 97.

GAME 48 - JOURNEY DOWN THE ANDUIN (NIGHTMARE)

Heroes: Aragorn (Lore), Beravor & Glorfindel. Elladan, Elrohir & Legolas.

 

This was a bloodbath. I had to kill four Hill Trolls and lost Aragorn, Beravor and Legolas in the effort. Regardless I managed to complete the quest in thirteen turns, Legolas's team winning 137 to Aragon's teams 145.

## 52 [silverthorn on May 15, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1085774)

GAME 49 - ESCAPE FROM DOL GOLDUR (NIGHTMARE)

Heroes: Elrond, Glorfindel (Spirit) & Mirlonde. Elladan, Elrohir & Legolas

 

This was another bloodbath, every hero had at least two wounds by the end of the game and both decks threat levels were over 45 when I gambled on playing everyone with any Willpower in order to beat the final Quest Phase. The game was over by turn eight with team Elrond scoring 131 to team Legolas's 134.

I'm using a deck made from the brothers and spirit Glorfindel. I'm enjoying it and have gotten 12 games down. Thanks for the inspiration.

If/when I start playing two handed again I think I'll try putting legolas in with the brothers, seems like it would work well.

Legolas is probably the most constant hero in the decks I've been playing with (especially since I got my hands on Rivendell Blade) because he's the only (for lack of  a better term) fighter hero who can contribute to questing without needing extra cards (although Blade of Gondolin is a nice bonus), unless I missed someone. I'm a little less gung-ho about Elladan and Elrohir after one of them was made prisoner in Escape from Dol Goldur and crippled my questing ability.

The brothers are the backbone of one of my decks (also has legolas as the third hero!), one of them being the prisoner in dol guldur is very brutal though...

Check it out, it might help you with what works well with them:

Just tried this with the two handed decks I posted... Got Loragorn as the prisoner but still lost brutally...... had ungoliants spawn, the new spider that gets surge if there are unclaimed clues and the treachery that makes every player discard all but 2 cards as the first three encounter cards guarding the objectives so I knew there was very little chance of victory from the start...... very very brutal start. I then went on to fight chieftain Uftak and kill him as well as ungoliants spawn and the other spider, kept control somewhat over locations and thought I may actually come back from the terrible start but then I copped a Torture Chamber and another location followed by another Torture Chamber and a Torture Master in the one go and the prisoner was killed.... was only 1 quest point away from clearing the chamber that went to 3 resources too.....

 

I beat most of the other nightmare decks I've played so far first or second try but this one is just crazy hard.... looks like it may take a little while, so many nasty nightmare cards.....

I decided to try and build two decks around themes and keep to the basic themes on all the quests (accounting for the fact that some of the heroes in one of the decks historically don't make it past the Battle of Five Armies).

 

GAME 50  (Woop! A quarter of the way to my target) - WE MUST AWAY 'ERE BREAK OF DAY:

Heroes - The Dwarves: Balin, Nori & Thorin Oakenshiled.

Heroes - The Elves: Elrond, Legolas & Mirlonde.

 

The two decks seemed to gel well together. The high-spot of the game being the Elves killing one of the Trolls on the turn that the Dwarves had ground another to one wound then using Mighty Prowess to kill the Dwarf-fodder Troll. All the heroes survived (although a whole load of allies died) and all the booty was captured. The game lasted 7 turns and the Dwarves won 89 points to 92.

 

GAME 51 - ACROSS THE MISTY MOUNTAINS GRIM

Heroes - The Dwarves: Balin, Nori & Thorin Oakenshiled.

Heroes - The Elves: Elrond, Legolas & Mirlonde.

 

I hit massively lucky with opening hands, pulling Vilya from the Elf deck and Steward of Gondor and Unexpected Courage from the Dwarf deck. Aftet Nori received the Stewardship and played Unexpected Courage on Elrond carrying Vilya I was churning out cards on the Elven side with Dwarves just behind. By the time the game was won on turn 8 I was running out of space to put all the allies in play. Again, the Dwarves squeeked a win through 108 to the Elves 109.

GAME 53 - DUNGEONS DEEP AND CAVERNS DIM

Heroes - The Dwarves: Balin, Nori & Thorin Oakenshiled.

Heroes - The Elves: Elrond, Legolas & Mirlonde.

 

Another win, despite the fact that both decks seemed to be running slower than normally. I hit lucky with Bilbo riddling and managed to get past Phase 2 in three turns, countering the lack of Allies coming into play for the Dwarves. All in all a lucky win in five turns with the Elves winning by 89 points to 92.

## 59 [silverthorn on May 22, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1093688)

GAME 54 - SPIDERS AND FLIES

Heroes - The Dwarves: Balin, Nori & Thorin Oakenshiled.

Heroes - The Elves: Elrond, Legolas & Mirlonde.

 

I managed to scrape a win by the narrowest of margins (mostly due to my once again putting Mighty Prowess on Legolas and racking up extra wounds aplenty on the huge number of spiders).

 

GAME 55 - THE LONELY MOUNTAIN

Heroes - The Dwarves: Balin, Nori & Thorin Oakenshiled.

Heroes - The Elves: Elrond, Legolas & Mirlonde.

 

Once again, a win by a flukey margin.

 

GAME 56 - THE BATTLE OF FIVE ARMIES

Heroes - The Dwarves: Balin, Nori & Thorin Oakenshiled.

Heroes - The Elves: Elrond, Legolas & Mirlonde.

 

This was brutal. I lost Legolas, Balin, Nori & Elrond before I managed to complete the campaign. Now to rebuild my Dwarf deck (since half the heroes are supposed to be dead by the time the next lot of scenarios begin).

I managed to get through fifty games a lot faster than I expected (even before I hit a big delay a couple of months ago). I'm trying to work out a pair of Elf-heavy  decks suitable for the The Dark Riders quests without going for a all-Hobbit deck. I'm guessing on something Ranger-related (with Loragorn) and a elf-heavy deck (probably with the brothers).

GAME 57 - PASSAGE THROUGH MIRKWOOD (AGAIN AND AGIN)

 

Heroes: Aragorn (Lore) Eowyn & Glorfindel (Spirit) and Elladan, Elrohir & Legolas.

 

This game was over in five turns (due to a combination of Sword that was Broken on Aragorn and Ally Faramir's bonus as well as several allies meaning that Aragorn's team quested for 26 on turn five, steam-rollering that Phase 3B which doesn't involve Ungoliant's Spawn.

For me, the secret would be to leave my family and my job. I don't watch tv so that won't accomplish much. I don't think the trade is good for me. Edited May 25, 2014 by joezim007

GAME 58 - JOURNEY DOWN THE ANDUIN (NIGHTMARE)

 

Heroes: Aragorn (Lore) Eowyn & Glorfindel (Spirit) and Elladan, Elrohir & Legolas.

 

Completed, although the all-Elf team hit 50 threat the turn before the end of the game. Despite the heavy mob getting side-lined Aragorn's team managed to complete the game in 7 turns with a total of six damage on the heroes. The final score was 113.

GAME 59 - ESCAPE FROM DOL GOLDUR (MIGHTMARE)

 

Heroes: Aragorn (Lore) Eowyn & Glorfindel (Spirit) and Elladan, Elrohir & Legolas.

 

Completed, with Legolas as the prisoner. As seems to be the norm for EFDG it was a 10 turn slog where the easiest part was dealing with the Nazgul (multiple Ranged attackers from Legolas's deck attacking the Nazgul, along with a Blade of Rivendell and Legolas shooting it with the Black Arrow killed it). In the end, the final scores were 131 for Aragorn's team to 141 for Legolas's team (due to a last turn use of Aragorn's ability).

GAME 60 - HUNT FOR GOLLUM (NIGHTMARE)

Heroes: Aragorn (Lore) Eowyn & Glorfindel (Spirit) and Elladan, Elrohir & Legolas.

 

This went well with a early Asfaloth allowing for accelerated disposal of the large number of Locations which came up in play. The quest was completed in eight turns with Aragorn's team winning by 114 points to Legolas's team's 118.

Do you manage to sneak a loragon threat reset in just before the end or do you typically use it during the game?

I tend to use it either at the end (if I'm pretty sure the game's nearly beat) or when Loragorn is low on Wounds (in case he cops it before I can use it).

GAME 61 - CONFLICT AT THE CARROCK (NIGHTMARE)

Heroes: Aragorn (Lore) Eowyn & Glorfindel (Spirit) and Elladan, Elrohir & Legolas.

 

This game was won in seven turns due to the brave sacrifice of all the allies who I let the Trolls dispose of whilst most of the heroes ground down enough Trolls to win. Rivendell Bows turned out to be as useful as I had expected and the game was won by Aragorn's team by 91 points to 100.

GAME 62 - A JOURNEY TO RHOSGOBEL (NIGHTMARE)

Heroes: Aragorn (Lore) Eowyn & Glorfindel (Spirit) and Elladan, Elrohir & Legolas.

 

I swapped out the Gandalf's in Aragorn's deck for three copies of Radagast and it pretty much meant nothing. By the end of turn five I was barely saved by using all the healers I had in play to keep the Eagle's wounds low enough that three copies of Athelas healed him completely. All in all a win with Aragorn's team winning by 77 points to Legolas's teams 83.

GAME 63 - THE HILLS OF EMYN MULL (NIGHTMARE)

Heroes: Aragorn (Lore) Eowyn & Glorfindel (Spirit) and Elladan, Elrohir & Legolas.

 

This was my first attempts at the Nightmare mode versions of the last three Shadows of Mirkwood quests. This was won due to Legolas killing a Tunnelling Nameless Thing using a Black Arrow (admittedly with assistance from one of the Brothers) the putting the Progress on Ruaros Falls to complete it. The three VP for Ruaros Falls added to the one VP from Black Arrow gave me the winning VP's. After 10 turns the scores were 125 for Aragorn's team versus 128 for Legolas's team.

 

GAME 64 - THE DEADLY MARSHES (NIGHTMARE)

Heroes: Aragorn (Lore) Eowyn & Glorfindel (Spirit) and Elladan, Elrohir & Legolas.

This was won due to an advanced amount of jamminess. On turn 6 I completed stage 3B with 6 resources on Gollum after using Legolas's team to provide the one progress I needed. After using a card from each deck to bolster Eowyn's Willpower I came up to a total of 17 Willpower. The Escape Test's total came to 16. In the end the scores were 92 for Aragorn's team versus 96 for Legolas's team.

GAME 65 - RETURN TO MIRKWOOD (NIGHTMARE)

Heroes: Aragorn (Lore) Eowyn & Glorfindel (Spirit) and Elladan, Elrohir & Legolas.

Thsi win was aclose run thing with the Elves guarding Gollum on the final 9th turn on 48 threat. Regardless, the Shadows of Mirkwood cycle is over and done with Aragorn's team winning by 128 points to 140. Onward to Dwarrowdelf.

GAME 66 - INTO THE PIT

Heroes: Aragorn (Lore) Eowyn & Glorfindel (Spirit) and Elladan, Elrohir & Legolas.

 

This mission went remarkably well, over five turns everything went well, Aragorn didn't fall down a hole on turn one :lol: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_laugh.png]  and the two decks gelled together well. In the end, Aragorn's team won by 73 points (the final threat was 27 without using Loragorn's ability) to Legolas's team's 85.

GAME 67 - THE SEVENTH LEVEL

Heroes: Aragorn (Lore) Eowyn & Glorfindel (Spirit) and Elladan, Elrohir & Legolas.

 

Another game where (other than no Light's of Valinor cropping up) things seemed to go well. The decks are capable of working well when the prime cards don't turn up during the game. After five turns, the scores were 82 for Aragorn's team vs 84 for Legolas's team (I didn't have a chance to use Loragorn's ability before I hit enough willpower to complete Stage 2B).

## 81 [silverthorn on June 8, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1112595)

GAME 68 - FLIGHT FROM MORIA

Heroes: Aragorn (Lore) Eowyn & Glorfindel (Spirit) and Elladan, Elrohir & Legolas.

 

This went not so well. Elrohir fell down a deep hole (due to the same card which did in Aragorn the first time I played this mission) but I gor a Unexpected Tools in the stage 1 setup and Escape from Darkness turned up second. All in all, the game took 6 turns and the scores were 89 for Aragorn's team vs 101 for Legolas's team.

GAME 69 - THE REDHORN GATE

Heroes: Aragorn (Lore) Eowyn & Glorfindel (Spirit) and Elladan, Elrohir & Legolas.

 

For this deck, rather than removing the Arwen allies from Aragorn's deck I used them as fodder for Eowyn's ability. This managed to grab me the extra progress to complete the game in turn 5 with a Black Arrow use on a goblin grabbing the extra VP to hit 5 VP (hence not using Loragorn's ability again due to just squeeking through on the Quest stage) In the end the scores were 77 for Aragorn's deck and 80

GAME 70 - ROAD TO RIVENDELL

Heroes: Aragorn (Lore) Eowyn & Glorfindel (Spirit) and Elladan, Elrohir & Legolas.

 

This was my first time attempting this mission (since I only got the pack a few weeks ago) and things seemed to go well. Over 5 turns I managed to out-quest everthing whilst Legolas and the brothers killed anything which got in the way. One thing was that no enemies with the Ambush ability cropped up. In the end I managed to score 81 points with both decks (no Light of Valinor on Glorfindel and damage on Aragorn's team bumped up their score).

GAME 71 - WATCHER IN THE WATER

Heroes: Aragorn (Lore) Eowyn & Glorfindel (Spirit) and Elladan, Elrohir & Legolas.

 

A bloodbath, Elladan and Eowyn were lost in seven turns as I managed to fluke a win. The surviving heroes all took varying amounts of damage before the win. The scores were 117 for Aragorn's team against 119 for Legolas's team.

Sorry for not posting for a while, it's taken me a while to get over a bad case of flu but, regardless, now that there are finally new sets out :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] I decided to jump to sets I had yet to try out therefore...

 

GAME 72 - ENCOUNTER AT AMON DIN

Heroes: Aragorn (Lore) Eowyn & Glorfindel (Spirit) and Elladan, Elrohir & Legolas.

 

Everything seemed to go my way with Legolas using a combination of Rivendell Bow, Hands Upon The Bow, Black Arrow and Blade of Gondolin to snipe Ghulat as soon as he entered the staging area. After that I completed the quest in five turns (thanks to low threat cards coming out in the Quest Phase) with the scores 71 for Aragorn's heroes against 74 for the Elves.

If I'm honest I started using Elladan and Elrohir for the simple reason that I'd finally got my hands on Road to Rivendell (the fact that the synergy is nifty was just a bonus). Now they are the powerhouses of the deck (even if Legolas tends to get all the credit when I'm writing the games up). The six heroes are probably the best combination of heroes I've used and (barring someone dying when I get to the Dark Riders) I really can't see my changing them. The plan, should I get that far (I'm probably a fair way behind schedule now) is to go back to Passage Through Mirkwood after I get up to date with the same heroes but probably different decks (I made a few minor changes as Dunland Trap came out and I'm guessing the situation will be the same as I proceed)

GAME 73 - ASSAULT ON OSGILIATH

 
Heroes: Aragorn (Lore) Eowyn & Glorfindel (Spirit) and Elladan, Elrohir & Legolas.
This one was easier than I expected, thanks to a combination of no more Osgiliath locations coming into play added to getting Asfaloth & Light of Valinor in my starting hand. By the end of turn three every hero was carrying at least one wound (6 damage from Archery on turn two) but the game was completed. Final scores were 64 for Aragorn's team and 69 for Legolas's.

GAME 74 - THE BLOOD OF GONDOR

Heroes: Aragorn (Lore), Eowyn, Glorfindel (Spirit) & Elladan, Elrohir & Legolas.

 

This was hard. Over six turns only ridiculous amounts of healing kept the VIP's alive. In the end almost every hero was on their last legs before Legolas fluked a win by killing a low-rent Orc to scrape the win. Aragorn's heroes won the game 80 points to 93.

 

GAME 75 - PASSAGE THROUGH MIRKWOOD (SOLO)

Heroes: Aragorn (Leadership), Dunhere and Eowyn

Having downloaded OCTGN I decided to give playing solo a try again, using only cards from sets released when the quest became available as well as my standard tooled up two-handed games. A nice idea but as I found on it makes things really complicated. I completed the basic version of Passage with the following score: Turns: 5 (50) + Threat: 34 + Damage: 7 = 91.

## 90 [silverthorn on July 17, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1158629)

GAME 76 - PASSAGE THROUGH MIRKWOOD

Heroes: Eowyn, Gimli, Legolas.

This went well, The old combination of heroes I used when I first bought the Core set was brought out of retirement and went through the quest fairly easily. The score was as follows: Points: 4 (40) + Threat: 35 + Total Damage: 3 - VP: 4 = 74.

 

GAME 77 - JOURNEY DOWN THE ANDUIN

Heroes: Eowyn, Gimli, Legolas.

This went badly. Getting the card which boosts your threat for each hero not assigned to a quest during set-up, pushing me over the limit to avoid dealing with the Hill Troll on turn one, set the tone for the (thankfully short) game. Getting enemies every turn didn't improve anything. In the end, the Hill Troll killed Gimli and caused enough extra threat to make me hit 50 on turn three. I'm going to have to go back to the drawing board.

I prefer two-handed myself but I wanted to try building decks using only the cards in play at the time, I'll be playing two-handed as well, interspersed with playing old quests solo.

## 93 [silverthorn on July 17, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1159382)

As a aside, the plan for now is to complete all the quests I haven't completed two-handed (from Morgul Vale to Dunland Trap and the Dark Riders quests) then focus on the solo games, playing the new quest packs two-hamded as they come out.

## 94 [silverthorn on July 18, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1160474)

GAME 78 - THE MORGUL VALE

Heroes: Aragorn (Lore), Eowyn, Glorfindel (Spirit) & Elladan, Elrohir & Legolas.

This was one of those games where everything seemed to fall into place. A first turn Rivendell Bow on Aragorn added to a relatively harmless set of Encounter deck draws meant that turns 2-4 descended into a pattern of one of team Legolas's allies taking a hit from the big bad then the brothers, Legolas and sniper Aragorn killing them. Elrohir took a lethal hit from the Nazgul but the use of a Black Arrow killed the Nazgul on turn four. Scores were 72 for Aragorn's heroes to 85 for the elves.

GAME 79 - THE FORDS OF ISEN

Heroes: Aragorn (Lore), Eowyn, Glorfindel (Spirit). Alladan, Elrohir & Legolas

A bloodbath, the heroes were swamped on turn 4.

 

GAME 80 - THE FORDS OF ISEN

Heroes: Aragorn (Lore), Eowyn, Glorfindel (Spirit). Alladan, Elrohir & Legolas

This was succesful, although Elrohir, Glorfindel & Legolas were lost and everyone else was wounded. This time I remembered to use one card per deck to buff Eowyn each turn. In the end the scores were 92 for Aragorn's team (thanks to using Aragorn's ability on turn six) to 117 for Legolas's team

GAME 80 - TO CATCH AN ORC

Heroes: Aragorn (Lore), Eowyn, Glorfindel (Spirit). Alladan, Elrohir & Legolas

 

This one seemed to fall into place. Nothing went unduly wrong and the whole thing was finished in 6 turns. The scores were 87 for Aragorn's team to 96 for the Elves.

GAME 81 - INTO ITHILIEN

Heroes: Aragorn (Lore), Eowyn, Glorfindel (Spirit). Alladan, Elrohir & Legolas

Completed with minimal fuss. Due to being in a hurry (due to a pressing engagement last night) I forgot to note the scores but the game was finished in 5 turns.

GAME 82 - THE DUNLAND TRAP

Heroes: Aragorn (Lore), Eowyn, Glorfindel (Spirit) & Elladan, Elrohir, Legolas

Completed in 5 turns, although Eowyn and Aragorn were lost and every other hero had at least 2 wounds on them. Scores were 91 for Legolas's team against 100 for Aragorn's team (unless I'm mistaken it's the first time the elves have scored lower than Aragorn's team)

 

GAME 83 - THE THREE TRIALS

Heroes: Aragorn (Lore), Eowyn, Glorfindel (Spirit) & Elladan, Elrohir, Legolas

A messy affair, every hero wound up wounded. Completed in seven turns. Scores were 81 for Aragorn's team to 92 for the Elves.

Since the release of the second Fellowship Sage box seems to be soon I'm going to hold off playing the Dark Riders two-handed until it comes out. therefore:

 

GAME 84 - PASSAGE THROUGH MIRKWOOD

Heroes: Aragorn (Leadership), Eowyn & Theodred.

Using a deck comprising only Core set cards. Completed fairly easily.

Score was: Turns 4: 40 + Threat: 33 + Damage: 4 = 77.

## 100 [silverthorn on August 10, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1192055)

GAME 85 - JOURNEY DOWN THE ANDUIN

Heroes: Aragorn (Leadership), Eowyn & Theodred.

Completed gradually over 11 turns. I used two Galadhrim's Greetings (and a Steward of Gondor on Eowyn) to keep my threat low enough to be able to get two Longbeard Orc Slayers in play to kill the Hill Troll. My score was: Turns 11: 110 +Threat: 27 + Damage: 2 - VP: 4 = 135.

You are doing great! Keep up the good work!

GAME 86 - PASSAGE THROUGH MIRKWOOD

Heroes: Eowyn, Gimli, Legolas.

 

Due to losing Eowyn in turn 2 I hit 50 threat in 6 turns (although, at that point I was down to Legolas and a Wandering Took with three enemies engaged so I wouldn't have survived the turn anyway). I may switch Eowyn out for Beravor and give this another go.

GAME 87 - A SHADOW OF THE PAST

Heroes: Aragorn (Lore), Eowyn, Glorfindel (Spirit) & Elladan, Elrohir & Legolas.

Completed in 8 turns with (thankfully) no hero casualties (due to a lucky run of healers). Added Mister Underhill & Gandalf's Delay to the Campaign Pool. Scores were 107 for Aragorn's team to 119 for Legolas's team.

 

GAME 88 - A KNIFE IN THE DARK

Heroes: Aragorn (Lore), Eowyn, Glorfindel (Spirit) & Elladan, Elrohir & Legolas.

Completed in 5 turns with (again) No hero losses. I gave Tireless Ranger to Legolas (making his deck a all-Ranger affair) and Skilled Healer to Eowyn (so that she's not got three starting Hit Points anymore). Points totals were 70 for Aragorn's team and 77 for the Mighty Morphin Elven Rangers  :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] .

GAME 89 - FLIGHT TO THE FORD

Heroes: Aragorn (Lore), Eowyn, Glorfindel (Spirit) & Elladan, Elrohir & Legolas.

Completed in 8 turns with no hero losses, although all the heroes were wounded at least once. Panicked and Fear of Discovery were added to the Campaign Pool. The scores were 122 each.

 

Since I'm now up-to-date I'm going back to the beginning and I'm going to try the quests solo again (although I'm ditching the idea of playing them with only cards produced to that point as it was a bad idea).

## 105 [silverthorn on August 19, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1210522)

The hero line up for my next lot of solo questing is going to be, oddly enough, Elladan, Elrohir & Legolas (only in a much more elven-focussed deck). I should be able to run through Passage To Mirkwood (again  :rolleyes: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_rolleyes.gif] ) tomorrow.

## 106 [silverthorn on August 19, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1212083)

GAME 90 - PASSAGE THROUGH MIRKWOOD

Heroes: Aragorn (Leadership), Eowyn, Theodred.

Having changed my mind about ditching the whole 'playing through the quests solo using only cards released to the point that the mission was published' this mission was surprisingly easy. Everything seemed to fall into place. Points wrere:

Rounds (4): 40

Threat: 28

Damage: 5

Total: 73

## 107 [silverthorn on August 21, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1217716)

GAME 91 - PASSAGE THROUGH MIRKWOOD

Heroes: Denethor, Eowyn, Legolas

Playing with just cards from the core set has forced me to be creative with my hero selection. I can count the amount of times I've used Walther in a deck or played tri-sphere on the fingers of one hand. Regardless, the deck performed better than I expected. Points were as follows:

Turns (7): 70

Threat: 33.

Damage: 1

Total; 104

## 108 [silverthorn on August 22, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1217985)

GAME 92 – JOURNEY DOWN THE ANDUIN

Heroes: Denethor, Eowyn, Legolas,

Again using only cards from the Core Set. This attempt succeeded because my Starting Threat was low enough that I had managed to accumulate enough resources (through a turn 1 Horn of Gondor on Denethor, although it should have been on Legolas since I had 11 resources on Walther at one point) to be able to play two full-cost Gandalf's on successive turns and kill the Hill Troll that way. Later I killed enemies as they hit the staging area on Phase 2 and cleared the Staging Area for Phase 3. I drew a pair of Locations on Phase 3B winning the quest. Points were:

Turns (11): 110

Threat: 42

Damage: 2

VP: 8

Total: 146

## 109 [silverthorn on August 22, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1219825)

GAMES 93 & 94 - ESCAPE FROM DOL GOLDUR

Heroes: Denethor, Eowyn, Legolas

On both occasions I was swamped because of having Denethor as the captive and three enemies showing up attached to the Objectives. I understand why people say that this quest is impossible with Core Set only decks.

## 110 [silverthorn on August 23, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1220141)

GAME 95 - PASSAGE THRIOUGH MIRKWOOD

Heroes: Denethor, Eowyn, Dunhere

This new combination seems to work better than the combo with Legolas. The Score was:

Turns (6): 60

Threat: 35

Damage: 2

Total: 97

 

GAME 96 - JOURNEY DOWN THE ANDUIN

Heroes: Denethor, Eowyn, Dunhere

This quest took a lot of turns but the heroes again seemed to work well together.

Turns (13): 130 (I had to play a holding action, using cards to lower my threat until I could get a Forest Snares out of the deck and slap it on the Hill Troll)

Threat: 42

VP: 4

Total: 168

## 111 [silverthorn on August 23, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1220730)

GAME 97 - ESCAPE FROM DOL GOLDUR

Heroes: Denethor, Dunhere, Eowyn

This was closer to a defeat than any time I've played LOTR. No hero came out unscathed (or, indeed with less than two damage) and I was going through Allies at a ridiculous rate. The score was:

 

Turns (9): 90

Threat: 49

Damage: 7

VP: 5

Total: 141

## 112 [PsychoRocka on August 23, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1220870)

Silverthorn I joined this forum on 26 Feb 2014 and started using the quest log on 3 March 2014 so probably have a whole handful of games I played before I joined the forums (maybe a month or so worth) and also from between joining the forums and actually using the log but as of tonight I just logged my 200th game =D

Which is just between a 5 month period so if I remain to get this much time/stay this interested in the game I should easily break 400 in a year!

Since I decided to try this I've hit stumbling block after stumbling block (I was planning to get one game in at least per day, that idea went kablooey about three weeks into the challenge). I seem to be getting more games in now (mostly on OCTGN) but I'm planning to start playing using physical cards as soon as I can get my hands on the new quest pack (since Haldir will probably go into the deck).

GAME 98 - HUNT FOR GOLLUM

Heroes: Denethor, Dunhere, Eowyn.

A less than spectacular victory since I had exactly one Clue card in play in Phase 3. Regardless, I've noticed that I seem to be playing a lot more Allies than I normally do.

 

Turns (8): 80

Threat: 37

Score: 117

## 115 [silverthorn on August 24, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1221473)

GAME 99 - CONFLICT AT THE CARROCK

Heroes: Denethor, Dunhere, Eowyn.

Lost due to not being able to kill a first turn Hill Troll (there were five or so cards I could have used which just refused to crop up, it may be the worst game I've played for card draw).

## 116 [silverthorn on August 24, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1222144)

GAME 100 CONFLICT AT THE CARROCK (ATTEMPT TWO)

Heroes: Aragorn (Leadership), Eowyn, Theodred

Optimized to get Leadership resources into play toot-sweet. Worked a lot better than the last try. I managed to get the Trolls into combat one at a time and (ab)use Grimbeorn as target for all their attacks with Aragorn, Grrmbeorn and a lot of Leadership allies (three Veteran Axehands at one point) to kill them.

 

Turns (10): 100

Threat: 35

VP: 4

Total: 131

 

This means I've managed half of my planned 200 games (with all the delays I've hit) in just over 5 months.

GAME 101 - JOURNEY TO RHOSGOBEL

Heroes: Beravor, Bilbo Baggins, Legolas

This game was shot to heck when I lost Bilbo on turn 1 due to damage from an Exhaustion. Suffice to say that the game didn't recover from that.

 

GAME 102 - JOURNEY TO RHOSGOBEL (ATTEMPT TWO)

Heroes; Beravor, Bilbo Baggins, Legolas

This time I managed to get two Caught In A Web's in Beravor and Bilbo by turn two. It's like I've hit a brick wall with this quest.

## 122 [silverthorn on August 25, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1223766)

GAME 103 - JOURNEY TO RHOSGOBEL (ATTEMPT THREE)

Heroes: Denethor, Eowyn, Legolas.

This hero combo barely squeeked a victory (I had two Athelas and 10 wounds on Wilyador when I hit Stage 3).

Rounds (9): 90

Threat: 29

Damage: 5

Total: 124

 

GAME 104 - HILLS OF EMYN MUL

Heroes: Denethor, Eowyn, Legolas

This one was a lot easier than the last quest. It just took slow, steady progress to beat it.

Rounds (12): 120

Threat: 36

VP: 21

Total 135

## 123 [silverthorn on August 25, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1223802)

GAME 105 - THE DEAD MARSHES

Heroes: Denethor, Eowyn, Legolas

This quest was helped by having two Escorts From Edoras in my starting hand. I wound up using them mostly for questing and Eowyn for beating Escape Tests. In the end I had to face a four-card Escape test and drew no cards with Escape values.

Rounds (5): 50

Threat: 30

Score: 83

## 124 [silverthorn on August 25, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1224103)

GAME 106 - RETURN TO MIRKWOOD

Heroes: Denethor, Eowyn, Legolas
I have a suspicion that I encountered every treachery or Shadow effect which increased threat in this game. 

Turns (3): 30

Threat: 46

Damage: 4

Total 80

 

GAME 107 - INTO THE PIT
Heroes: Eown, Gimli, Legolas

Trying a new team of heroes turned out well. Eowyn quested, Legolas kicked seven shades of stuff out of Orcs and Gimil absorbed enough damage that he was on 9 wounds when the game finished (thankfully, I managed to put two Citadel Plates on him). It was a long quest but I managed to finish it.

Turns (10): 100

Threat: 43

Damage: 9 (all on Gimli)

VP: 4

Total: 148

## 125 [silverthorn on August 25, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1224415)

GAME 108 - THE SEVENTH LEVEL

Heroes: Eowyn, Gimli, Legolas

Again, the heroes each did what they did best and I didn't get swamped by enemies. Putting the Horn of Gondor onto Eowyn allowed me to get two Escorts From Edoras into play quickly and (thanks to Legolas providing enough Progress from killing Orcs to finish the first two stages allowing me to keep the Escorts from discarding).

 

Turns (9): 90

Threat: 31

Damage: 1

How did you beat Return to Mirkwood in 3 turns? Isn't that impossible?

I was questing to a ridiculous degree (due to a low amount of enemies turning up but a stupid amount of treachery cards which added threat one way or the other). I know I seemed to be going through the mission at a heck of a rate so I may have done something wrong.

## 128 [PsychoRocka on August 26, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1225180)

> I was questing to a ridiculous degree (due to a low amount of enemies turning up but a stupid amount of treachery cards which added threat one way or the other). I know I seemed to be going through the mission at a heck of a rate so I may have done something wrong.

The earliest you'd be able to beat it is during turn 4 cause there are 4 quest stages.

That would be pretty goddamn difficult though....

The quest points for each stage are 12, 3, 7, 2. Between a big quest rush, some luck, and Legolas' ability, I don't see why a 3 round game can't happen on occasion. It would be extremely unlikely to pull off (and may require more of the cardpool), but it seems possible to win during the 2nd round if you get a first turn Blade of Gondolin on Legolas: First turn, spam cheap willpower effects to clear stage 1. In combat, hope for a bat to kill and make the progress for stage 2. Quest with what's still in play on round 2 to clear stage 3 and then hope for another weak enemy for Legolas to kill to win. As mentioned, this will only happen once in every 1,000 games or so, but it can be done!

Hmmmm I think once every 1,000,000,000,000 game you mean? Especially considering if there is a SINGLE other enemy in play on stage 4 you cannot win till you kill it

Yup. I shouldn't have made it sound so hopeful, since I doubt I'll ever get a victory in that manner.

 

But I do think Silverthorn's victory is perfectly reasonable in a treachery-heavy draw from the encounter deck.

## 132 [GrandSpleen on August 26, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1225343)

Yeah, it can be done.

 

Round 1 - Quest halfway through first quest stage.

Round 2 - Finish stage 1 of quest, go on to stage 2.  Legolas defeats an enemy, and with Gondolin Blade attached (or some other effect, like Ravens of the Mountain), finish stage 2 and go to stage 3.

Round 3 - Quest through stage 3.

Round 4 - Quest through stage 4 and defeat all enemies.  Even if you hold everyone back for combat, Legolas can clear the stage by himself after defeating an enemy.

 

Game ends on round 4, so 30 points from turns (as reported above).   Would be fun to watch this game in action, very lucky indeed!

All the encounter cards were either enemies who Legolas could kill with two Blades of Gondolin or Treachery/Shadow cards which increased my Threat (by the end of the game I was sick as a parrot about the threat increases).

GAME 109 - ESCAPE FROM MORIA

Heroes:Eowyn, Gimli, Legolas

This game seemed to take longer than it did. Other than a distinct lack of Tactics card draws (boy was I glad I put the HoG on Eowyn) things went according to plan.

Turns (5): 50

Threat: 37

VP: 7

Total: 80

GAME 110 & 111 - THE REDHORN GATE

Heroes: Eowyn, Gimli, Legolas

The first time I tried this quest I made the error of counting Caradhras's WP penalty while it was in the Staging Area. Once I realised that I started again and had a lot more luck. The game was not much of a challenge.

Turns (5): 50

Threat: 34

Damage: 2

VP: 5

Total: 81

 

GAME 112 - ROAD TO RIVENDELL

Heroes: Elladan, Elrohir, Eowyn

Replacing Legolas & Gimli with the brothers seems to have worked well. I placed a Horn of Gondor straight onto Eowyn and that (alongside the bonus resources added by Arwen) allowed me to pay for the high number of Spirit allies I was playing

Turns (10). 100

Threat: 39

Total: 139

GAME 113 - THE WATCHER IN THE WATER

Heroes: Elladan, Elrohir, Eowyn

This mission seemed to have taken less turns than I had thought. Getting Arwen out early on bolstered Elrohir's defenses and Elladan killed about half a dozen tentacles (or is that the other way around). All in all, the current hero combo seems strong.

Turns (7): 70

GAME 114 - PASSAGE THROUGH MIRKWOOD (NIGHTMARE)

Heroes; Celeborn, Haldir of Lorien, Legolas

This all-Silvan deck worked well, if slowly (I managed to draw enough high--Threat locations that I was on 37 threat at the end of turn two). Once the deck started rolling I was putting a lot of allies into play (despite being tri-sphere). 

 

Turns (11): 110 + Threat: 39 - VP: 4 = 145.

## 140 [silverthorn on September 9, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1255407)

GAME 115 - PASSAGE THROUGH MIRKWOOD (NIGHTMARE)

Heroes: Beregond, Eowyn & Legolas

My new plan is to try and complete all the quests (other than the Hobbit ones since two of the heroes weren't born then) with the same hero combo. In this case the quest went well, although I wound up having to deal with Ungoliant's Spawn (thankfully, I had a Black Arrow in place on Legolas).

Turns (5): 50 + Threat: 32 + Damage: 2 = 84.

## 141 [silverthorn on September 27, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1279044)

GAME 116 - PASSAGE THROUGH MIRKWOOD (PROGRESSIVE VERSION)

Heroes: Eowyn, Gimli, Legolas.

Trying the old idea of completing quests using decks from sets created at the time, this deck worked better than I had expected.

Turns (5): 50 + Threat: 35 + Damage: 3 = 88.

 

GAME 117 - JOURNEY DOWN THE ANDUIN (PROGRESSIVE VERSION)

Heroes: Eowyn, Gimi, Legolas.

Due to a lot of early high threat Locations and a couple of the cards which increase threat for every character who isn't questing (not a fun card when Eowyn was doing the bulk of questing), I hit 48 threat on turn three and Eowyn spent most of her resources from that point paying for Galadhrim's Greetings and towards a couple of late-game Gandalf's to kill off a second Hill Troll who popped up on turn 13. All. in all a real struggle to complete the mission (and Journey isn't even the hardest mission in Core Set).

Turns (14): 140 + Threat: 40 + Damage: 1 - VP: 8 = 173.

GAME 118 - PASSAGE THROUGH MIRKWOOD (NIGHTMARE)

Hereos: Beregond, Eowyn, Legolas.

This is probably the worst run of luck I've ever had in a game of LOTR LCG. By the end of turn one, Legolas was dead from the unfortunate combination of losing a Defender of Rammas to a Hummerhorns shadow draw which meant that the follow-up attack from a East Bight Patrol was going to kill one of my heroes and the game went downhill from there. I lasted as far as the combat phase of turn two when three enemies killed my other two heroes with undefended attacks. All in all, not my best hour of playing.

GAME 119 - PASSAGE THROUGH MIRKWOOD (NIGHTMARE)

Heroes: Beregond, Haldir of Lorien, Legolas.

This quest was not as difficult as the final score I achieved may make it look. I probably hit every location in the deck, pushing the amount of turns it took to grind through them higher and higher. I also had to do the 'Beorn's Path' option, then hit the Ungolients Spawn o half-way through that.

Turns (14): 140

Threat: 40

VP: 4.

Total: 176.

GAME 120 – PASSAGE THROUGH MIRKWOOD

Heroes: Beregond, Eowyn, Legolas

This deck, going back to one of my old favourites seemed to work well, despite my hitting a unusually low number of enemies. Eowyn quested well and Legolas killed anything which showed up but Beregond had little or nothing to do (I put a Defender of Rammas into play on turn one and he pulled most of the defending duties because I couldn't remember if there was a Shadow effect in standard Passage which destroys defenders or not). The Beorn's Path version of Stage 3B turned into a slog when I was questing heavily but I kept on hitting locations, rendering Legolas as a sub-par quester (I had put a Light of Valinor on him the turn I blew through Stage 2B, which was handy).

 

Completed Turns (9): 90

Threat: 34.

Damage: 2

VP: 0

Total: 126.

GAME 121 - A SHADOW OF THE PAST

Heroes: Aragorn (Lore), Eowyn & Glorfindel (Spirit) and Elladan, Elrohir & Legolas

Going back to a working combination of decks for arun through of all six Fellowship quests. The two decks worked well, with Aragorn's heroes questing hard and Legolas's team killing anything which showed up. In the end Gandalf's Delay and Mister Underhill were added to the Campaign Log. After 8 rounds the scores were 115 for Legolas's team to 117 for Aragorn's team.

GAME 122 - A KNIFE IN THE DARK

Heroes: Aragorn (Lore), Eowyn & Glorfindel (Spirit) and Elladan, Elrohir & Legolas

This went badly. I couldn't kill Bin Ferny fast enough and I wound up with 4 Ringwraiths and the Witch-King at Weathertop. Everybody died. I need to either rebuild my decks from the ground up or start over with new hero combos.

I've decided to go back to my old-school decks with the same heroes which is on  http://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/104951-two-handed-decks/page-2 [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/104951-two-handed-decks/page-2]. These were ridiculously good decks so I'll give A Knife In The Dark without changing them and see how they hold up before I make any modifications.

GAME 123 - SHADOW OF THE PAST

Heroes; Aragorn (Leadership), Beravor & Theodred and Dunhere, Eomer & Eowyn.

This combo of heroes seemed to work well. The quest went well and I completed the game in 7 or 8 turns (for some reason the post I posted didn't make it as far as this page). Mister Underhill & Gandalf's Delay were added to the Campaign Pool.

 

GAME 124 - A KNIFE IN THE DARK

Heroes; Aragorn (Leadership), Beravor & Theodred and Dunhere, Eomer & Eowyn.

I was swamped at Weathertop. I may have to change the decks a little.

GAME 125 - A KNIFE IN THE DARK

Heroes; Aragorn (Leadership), Beravor & Theodred and Dunhere, Eomer & Eowyn.

After the disappointment of the last game this one went a lot better. Everybody had at least one wound on them but no heroes died and I managed to complete the quest. In the aftermath Eowyn gained the Warrior trait and Theodred became a Ranger.

GAME 126 - FLIGHT TO THE FORD

Heroes; Aragorn (Leadership), Beravor & Theodred and Dunhere, Eomer & Eowyn.

Another game I just won. Again, every hero was wounded and I was lucky to only gain two new Burdens, Overcome By Terror and Panicked, to the Campaign Pool. The problem with these missions has been the high stats on the Nazgul. At least with the Road Darkens there should be less Nazgul to fight.

As good as only gaining two is I definitely recommend playing again and getting just the one (or even none) burden. It will help make the entire campaign more managable.

## 152 [silverthorn on October 17, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1302862)

This run through is more a 'darn the consequences' run since I plan to go back to playing solo after this so I probably won't revisit this combo again. Of course chances are that this decision will bite me on the rump before I'm finished the Road Darkens.

GAME 127 - THE RING GOES SOUTH

Heroes: Aragorn (Leadership), Beravor & Theodred and Dunhere, Eomer & Eowyn.

This one was troublesome. I managed to get into Moria (just) but Dunhere was killed by the Watcher in the Water. Added to that, I managed to gain Lust For The Ring as a burden. I'm guessing the luck which has got me through some of the scenarios has turned and it may only get worse.

GAME 128 - JOURNEY IN THE DARK

Heroes: Aragorn (Leadership), Beravor & Theodred and Dwalin, Eomer & Eowyn.

This one went so badly awry that I nearly threw the towel on three occasions. Eomer sacrificed himself after I had lost Theodred and Dwalin to Orc attacks. Finally, the last three heroes managed to get out of Moria but (due to a colossal miscalculation on my part) managed to complete the level with the Balrog still in play, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. If the game had continued past that turn I would likely have lost either Beravor or Aragorn the next turn, In the aftermath, Overcome By Grief, Grievous Wound, Pursued by the Enemy and Shadow of Fear were added to the Campaign Pool.

I didn't start until  the 19th March so I should be able to complete at least 200 games by then (although I've had a lot less time to play games recently I'm going to have more time now, unless something else unexpected happens).

GAME #129 - A SHADOW OF THE PAST

Heroes: Denethor, Eowyn & Gimli.

This slightly odd combination worked very well, if a little slowly. Of the cards I expected to need the most only one (Unexpected Courage, thankfully in my opening hand) showed up. Unexpected Courage let me use Denethor's ability to filter the danger cards out of my way, which was handy since all of Frodo's resources were paying for the upkeep on Gildor Inglorion. Any enemies were dealt with by Gimli (with two Dwarven Axes and not bothering with the 'load Gimli up on damage cards and let him carve up the enemy' plan I originally had. All in all, a good first outing for this deck. In the aftermath I added The Ring Draws Them and Gildor Inglorion to my campaign pool. The final score was: Rounds (14): 140 + Threat: 42 - VP: 1 = 181.

GAME #130 - A KNIFE IN THE DARK

Heroes: Denethor, Eowyn & Gimli.

Another success, also another slow success. I didn't manage to get Unexpected Courage and thus Denethor spent most of the time doing nothing but scrying. This, alongside Frodo's ability and use of Hasty Stroke and A Test of Will managed to get me into a fight with the Witch-King having put no Nazgul into the deck. After that it was a case of using all the allies I had deployed to beat up the Witch-King and win the game. In the end, Skilled Healer went on Gimli, so that he can take more damage and buff up more. The score was: Rounds: (13): 130 + Threat: 43 - VP: 3 = 170. The scores may be high but at least I'm having less trouble than the last decks I tried.

GAME 131 - A SHADOW OF THE PAST

Heroes: Bifur, Dain Ironfoot & Gloin and Gimli, Nori & Thalin.

After dipping my toes back into solo play I decided to return to the relative safety of playing two-handed. The idea of two Dwarf-based decks worked well and everything seemed to click, apart from having five Locations in play when Stage 3A came into play. Dain did very little (which is his main purpose in life, the Spirit/Tactics deck dealt with any enemies and he was mostly there to make the other Dwarves better) and after a huge slog the game was complete. In the aftermath I took the boon Mister Underhill (it's better than having a Elf following them around like a love-sick puppy) and the Burden The Ring Draws Them. All in all a good start.

## 160 [silverthorn on October 22, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1307789)

GAME 132 - A KNIFE IN THE DARK

Heroes: Bifur, Dain Ironfoot & Gloin and Gimli, Nori & Thalin.

Again, the two decks seemed to gel together well. Despite the long hard slog to the finish every hero made it out alive and Dain gained the Noble Hero card (so that the king of the Dwarves gets the Noble trait) and Gimli got the Skilled Healer card to boost his Hit Points and (potentially) the damage he can put out.

 

GAME 133 - FLIGHT TO THE FORD

Heroes: Bifur, Dain Ironfoot & Gloin and Gimli, Nori & Thalin.

Another hard thought victory with pretty much all the heroes injured to one degree or another and a huge amount of dead allies. Due to taking a ridiculous amount of attacks from Ringwraiths I managed to win the game with only one Burden in play, Fear of Discovery, which should make later games easier. Onwards to Rivendell.

GAME 134 - THE RING GOES SOUTH

Heroes: Bifur, Dain Ironfoot & Gloin and Gimli, Nori & Thalin.

This run-through was nowhere near as bad as the last time I played this. Thanks to the Skilled Healer on Gimli, he could take five points of damage from The Watcher, then hit back for 8, doing enough damage to retrieve Frodo, In the next turn I quested with just about everyone and blew through the Doors of Durin to win the scenario. Lust For The Ring came up as a Shadow effect so I dodged that burden.

## 162 [silverthorn on October 22, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1308415)

GAME 135 - A JOURNEY IN THE DARK

Heroes: Bifur, Dain Ironfoot & Gloin and Gimli, Nori & Thalin.

This one was a slog. No hero was on less than two wounds (and I was massively grateful for Hardy Leadership). Nori was sacrficed (due to his being on one hit point and no healers in play or hand, so the odds of him surviving were low to non-existent).  Despite that I managed to complete the quest, adding Pursued by the Enemy & Overcome By Grief to the campaign pool.

 

GAME 136 - THE BREAKING OF THE FELLOWSHIP

Heroes: Bifur, Dain Ironfoot & Gloin and Dwalin, Gimli & Thalin.

This was less of a slog than a blood-bath. Gloin was lost by a bad Shadow card (and Gimli notched up a ridiculous amount of dead Uruk's in revenge). In the end Ill Fate was added to the campaign pool and Nori & Bifur were captured.

 

All in, the new scenarios have been fun, if a little on the tough side. I'm lucking forward to eventually playing them again when I next get to this point when I start playing through the scenarios again.

I made a mistake reporting this (this is what happens when I didn't make notes like I normally do). Nori was sacrificed to the Balrog and Dwalin was captured with Bifur during the Breaking of the Fellowship

I was planning to try all the scenarios I've got (except for the Hobbit ones because they are before most of the heroes were born) solo tonight until I saw the release article for Nin-In-Elph (http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=5144 [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=5144] if you haven't seen it yet). I was thinking about doing a deck with LeaderGorn, Theodred and someone else and new hero fits well so I'll probably hold off until Tuesday or Wednesday when I'm likely to get it.

GAME 137 - PASSAGE THROUGH MIRKWOOD

Heroes: Beregond, Eowyn and Legolas.

 

Set-Up

 

I start off with a starting threat of 28. My starting hand is Hasty Stroke, Descendant of Thorandor, A Test Of Will, Song Of Travel, Radagast and The Eagles Are Coming. I choose to mulligan and get Escort From Edoras, A Test Of Will, Gandalf (Core), Vassal of the Windlord, Eagles of the Misty Mountains and Arwen Undomiel. It's not a great starting hand but it will have to do.

 

Quest stage 1A tells me to put a Forest Spider and Old Forest Road into the staging area for a total threat of 3.

 

The first thing to happen is all my heroes gain one resource each.(Beregond 1, Eowyn 1, Legolas 1) and draw The Galadhrim's Greetings.

 

In the Planning Phase I play Vassal of the Windlord (Legolas -1/0).

 

In the Quest Phase I exhaust Eowyn for a total Willpower of 4. The Staging draw is Black Forest Bats for a total threat of 4 but Black Forest Bats's ability removes Eowyn from the quest. I lose by 4 and my threat goes up to 32.

 

In the Travel Phase I travel to Old Forest Road and use it's ability to refresh Eowyn.

 

In the Encounter Phase, both Black Forest Bats and Forest Spider have lower Threat ratings than my threat total of 28 so they both attack.

 

As the Combat Phase begins I place a Shadow card on both attackers and the Forest Spider attacks Beregond and the Black Forest Bats attack Eowyn.

 

The Shadow card for the Forest Spider is Necromancer's Pass, no effect meaning that the Forest Spider's attack strength is 3 (thanks to the +1 it gains in it's first turn, no damage done). The Black Forest Bats's shadow card is Mountains Of Mirkwood, no effect. The Bats do one damage to Eowyn, which is stopped by her Defence strength.

 

Legolas attacks the Forest Spider for 3 damage, of which the Spider's defence counts for 1, leaving him on 2 Wounds.

 

With that the round ends and I refresh all my cards before putting my threat up to 33.

 

As turn two begins I have nothing in the Staging Area, Old Forest Road is the Active Location and I am engaged with Black Forest Bats & a Forest Spider (with 2 wounds remaining).

 

As the Resource Phase begins I place one resource on all my heroes (Beregond: 2, Eowyn: 2, Legolas: 1) and I draw The Eagles Are Coming. I immediately play it and look at the top 5 cards of my deck, looking for Eagle cards. Out of the 5 cards I only get another Vassal of the Windlord. The other 4 cards are shuffled into my deck.

 

In the Planning Phase I play another Vassal of the Windlord (Beregond -1/1 resource) and Arwen Undomiel (Eowyn -2/0 resources).

 

As the Quest Phase begins I exhaust Eowyn (for 4) and Arwen Undomiel (for 2, Arwen adding +1 defence to one of the Vassal of the Windlords for this turn) for a total Willpower of 6. The Staging draw is Forest Gate, for a total threat of 2. I make 4 progress, using 3 to explore Old Forest Road and put 1 progress on Stage 1B.

 

In the Travel Phase I travel to Forest Gate, allowing me to draw 2 cards. These are Gondorian Shield and Light of Valinor. Both cards will be going straight into play next turn.

 

Since there are no Enemies in the Staging Area I go straight to the Combat Phase, adding a shadow card to Black Forest Bats and Forest Spider. The Black Forest Bats engage one of the Vassals of the Windlord and the Forest Bats engage Beregond.

 

The Black Forest Bats shadow card is The Necromancer's Reach for no effect. The attack strength is 1 against the Vassal of the Windlord's augmented 1 defence, no damage.

 

The Forest Spider's shadow card is Caught In A Web, no effect and a nasty Treachery out of play. The Forest Spider does 2 attack, woefully inadequate compared to Beregond's 4 defence

 

Legolas attacks the Forest Spider for 3 damage, doing 2 damage to the Spider and killing it. Legolas's ability adds 2 progress to Forest Gate,

 

The other Vassal of the Windlord attacks the Black Forest Bats for 3 damage, killing them but causing the Vassal to the discarded.

 

At that point, with nothing in the staging area or engaged with me I refresh all my cards and increase my threat to 34.

 

At the beginning of turn 3 I add one resource to all my heroes (Beregond: 2, Eowyn: 1, Legolas: 2) and draw Eagles of the Misty Mountains.

 

In Planning I play Light Of Valinor (Eowyn -1/0 resources) on Legolas meaning that he can quest without exhausting. He may only quest for 1 but every little helps. I also play Eagle of the Misty Mountains (Beregond -2/0 resources, Legolas -2/0 resources).

 

In the Quest phase I exhaust Eowyn for 4, Legolas quests for 1 without exhausting and Arwen exhausts to quest for 2 (while adding 1 to Beregond's defence for this turn). This gives me a total Willpower of 7.

 

The Staging draw is another Forest Spider for a total Threat of 2, 5 progress is made. 2 goes on Forest Gate, exploring it and 3 goes onto Stage 1B, leaving me with 4 of the needed 8 progress.

 

There are no locations to travel to so I move onto the Encounter Phase where the Forest Spider's threat is low enough for it to engage me.

 

The Spider engages Beregond. The Shadow card is Enchanted Stream for no effect. The Spider attacks for 3 which doesn't penetrate Beregond's 4 defence.

 

Legolas and the Vassal of the Windlord attack the Forest Spider for a combined attack of 6, killing it and adding 2 progress to stage 1B. Whereas the Vassal would normally go to the discard pile Eagles of the Misty Mountains's ability means that the Vassal goes under the Eagles adding 1 to the Eagle's attack and defence.

 

With the combat over all my cards refresh and my threat goes up to 35.

 

As turn 4 begins I add a resource to all my heroes (Beregond: 1, Eowyn: 1, Legolas: 1) and draw Radagast. He will be useful when I get the resources to pay for him.

 

In the Planning phase I play Gondorian Shield on Beregond (Beregond -1/0 resources). This card puts Beregond's defence up to 6.

 

In the Quest phase I exhaust Eowyn for 4 and Arwen for 2, adding 1 to Beregond's already prodigious defence for the round. This gives a total Willpower of 6. The Staging draw is Dol Goldur Beastmaster for a total Threat of 2. 4 Progress is made, 2 completes Stage 1B and the other 2 is lost.

 

Stage 2A has no game text, Stage 2B only needs 2 progress to complete but when it is completed I have to randomly select one of the two Stage 3's.

 

The Dol Goldur Beastmaster's threat is low enough that it engages me.

 

In the Combat Phase I have to add 2 Shadow cards to the Dol Goldur Beastmaster. He engages Beregond. The Shadow cards are Great Forest Web, no effect and Ungolient's Spawn, this is possibly the worst Shadow effect in the quest as it immediately increases my threat to 39 and, unfortunately I have nothing to stop it. After that the Beastmaster's attack is 3 to Beregond's 7 defense.

 

Legolas and the Eagles of the Misty Mountains attack the Dol Goldur Beastmaster for 7 attack, killing it. Legolas's ability adds 2 progress to Stage 2B, completing it.

 

I shuffled the two stage 3B and drew “Don't Leave The Path”. This is bad as it means that I have to search the Encounter Discard pile for Ungolient's Spawn and put it into my Staging Area. On the up side, all I need to do is defeat it to win the quest. The problem is that it's a tough spider to beat.

 

With the end of the Combat phase I refresh all of my cards and increase my threat to 40.

 

Turn Five begins with all my heroes getting a resource (Beregond: 1, Eowyn: 2, Legolas: 2) and I draw a Escort From Edoras.

 

In the Planning Phase I play Gandalf (Beregond -1/0 resources, Eowyn -2/0 resources, Legolas: -2/0 resources) and immediately cause 4 damage to Ungolient's Spawn, leaving it with 5 wounds remaining.

 

In the Quest phase I exhaust Eowyn for 4 and Arwen for 2 (adding 1 to Beregond's defense) for a total of 6 willpower. The Shadow draw is The Necromancer's Reach which does 1 damage to Eowyn and Arwen Undomiel. The Threat total is 3 so I make 3 progress. This is meaningless since the quest only ends when the Ungolient's Spawn dies.

 

Since there are no locations in play I go straight to the Encounter Stage. The Ungolient's Spawn immediately engages Beregond. The Shadow card is Necromancer's Pass, no effect. The Ungolient's Spawn does 5 damage against Beregond's 7 defence. No damage.

 

In return, Legolas, The Eagle of the Misty Mountains and Gandalf attack the Spawn for 11 damage, 4 more damage than was needed to kill it and end the game.

 

 

As far as the game went everything seemed to go to plan. Playing solo means that I could steadily deal with everything that came my way. All my heroes did what they were there to do admirably and I have no complaints about the deck.

 

As far as scores go, the deck scored as follows:

 

Completed Turns (4): 40.

Threat: 40.

Threat of Dead Heroes: 0.

Damage on Surviving Heroes: 1 (Eowyn).

Victory Points: 0.

Total; 81.

GAME 138 – JOURNEY DOWN THE ANDUIN

Heroes: Beregond, Eowyn & Legolas

 

I'm using the same deck as the last game, but hoping for a Gondorian Shield in my opening hand this time. As per usual my starting threat is twenty eight. My opening hand is Winged Guardian, Vassal of the Windlord, Eagles of the Misty Mountains, Gondorian Shield, Unexpected Courage and Citadel Plate. All in all it's got the card I most needed so I'll keep it.

 

Stage 1A requires me to play the top card in the encounter deck, namely Driven By Shadow. This has no effect but surges. The replacement is Banks of the Anduin.

 

Stage 1B tells me to search the encounter deck for a Hill Troll and add it to the staging area. It also says that I cannot pass to stage 2A unless I make eight progress and kill the Hill Troll. The Banks of the Anduin and the Hill Troll make for a total threat of two in the staging area.

 

Turn one begins with me adding one resource to all my heroes (Beregond: One, Eowyn: One, Legolas: One) and drawing Light of Valinor. This makes for a top class opening hand.

 

In the Planning phase I spend one resource from Eowyn to play Light of Valinor on Legolas, play Gondorian Shield on Beregond for free and one resource from Legolas to play Vassal of the Windlord. That leaves me with some important cards in play but no resources.

 

As the Quest phase begins I exhaust and commit Eowyn for four willpower and commit Legolas for one willpower, giving me a total of five willpower.

 

The staging draw is The Brown Lands, which is pretty much the worst card I could have hoped for. It is a five threat location which means that the threat total is seven. This means that I lose by two and put my threat up to thirty, meaning that the Hill Troll will be engaging me this turn. I'm so glad I got a Gondorian Shield out.

 

In the Travel phase I travel to the Brown Lands, which allows me to immediately place one progress token on it and explore it. The Brown Lands goes straight into the discard pile.

 

During the encounter phase I have no choice but to have the Hill Troll engage me.

 

The Hill Troll gains a shadow card and attacks Beregond. The shadow card is Eastern Crows, which adds one to the Hill Troll's attack, boosting it to seven. Against Beregond's six defence it does one damage.

 

In retaliation Legolas and the Vassal attack the Troll for six, doing three damage to it and leaving it with six more wounds. I then discard the Vassal.

 

At the end of turn one I refresh all my cards and increase my threat to thirty one.

 

At the start of turn two I add one resource to all my heroes and draw The Eagles Are Coming.

 

At the start of the Planning phase I play the Eagles are Coming, which allows me to draw the top 5 cards of my deck and add any cards with the Eagle keyword into my hand. The cards are Gandalf (Core), Hasty Stroke, Song of Battle, The Eagles Are Coming and Support of the Eagles. The last two go into my hand and the rest are shuffled back into the deck.

 

I then play the new The Eagles Are Coming and draw Black Arrow, Song of Battle, Gwalhir, Feint and Hasty Stroke. Out of those only Gwalhir goes into my hand. The rest are shuffled back into the deck.

 

After all that I spend the resources on Beregond and Legolas to play Winged Guardian.

 

In the Quest phase I exhaust and commit Eowyn for four willpower and commit Legolas for one willpower, giving me a total of five willpower.

 

The staging draw is Dol Goldur Orcs, for a total threat of three. I put the two progress on Stage 1B. The Orcs also do two damage to Legolas.

 

In the Travel phase I travel to Banks of the Anduin.

 

In the encounter phase I am forced to engage the Dol Goldur Orcs.

 

Going on to the combat phase I add a shadow card to Dol Goldur Orcs and Hill Troll. The Hill Troll attacks Beregond, the Shadow card is Evil Strom, no effect and the Troll's six attack does no damage to Beregond.

 

The Dol Goldur Orcs attack the Winged Guardian, the Shadow card is Wargs, boosting the Orcs attack to three, insufficient to break through the Winged Guardian's four defence. I am forced to discard the Guardian.

 

Legolas attacks the Dol Goldur Orcs for three damage, killing them and adding two progress to The Banks of the Anduin.

 

To finish off turn two I refresh all my cards and increase my threat to thirty two.

 

Commencing turn three I add one resource to all my heroes and draw Radagast.

 

In the planning phase I spend the two resources on Eowyn to play Unexpected Courage in Beregond.

 

In the quest phase I exhaust and commit Eowyn for four willpower and commit Legolas for one willpower, giving me a total of five willpower.

 

The staging draw is Pursued By Shadow, which raises my threat to thirty three. This give a total of zero threat. I put one progress on Banks of the Anduin, exploring it and placing it back on top of the Encounter deck, and put four progress on Stage 1B, putting it on six progress of the eight I need.

 

There are no locations to travel to and no unengaged enemies so the combat phase begins with a shadow card being placed on the Hill Troll before it engages Beregond. The Shadow card is the Banks of the Anduin I put on top of the encounter deck, which has no effect. The six damage the Hill Troll inflicts is matched by Beregond's defence. I then use Unexpected Courage to refresh him.

 

Beregond and Legolas attack the Hill Troll for four damage, doing one wound and putting him on four wounds.

 

At the end of the round I refresh all my cards and increase my threat to thirty four.

 

At the start of turn four I place one resource on all my heroes and draw Arwen Undomiel.

 

During planning I spend two resources each from Beregond and Legolas to play Eagles of the Misty Mountains.

 

As usual, in the quest phase I exhaust and commit Eowyn for four willpower and commit Legolas for one willpower, giving me a total of five willpower.

 

The shadow draw is Necromancers Pass, for a total threat of three. I add two progress to Phase 1B for a total of eight threat. All I need to do to complete it is kill the Hill Troll, something which is turning out to be a problem.

 

In the travel phase I travel to the Necromancers Pass which means that I have to discard two random cards from my hand. The cards are Gwalhir and Support of the Eagles, which is not good.

 

Due to there being no enemies in the staging area, the combat phase starts with Hill Troll gaining a shadow card and attacking Beregond. The Shadow card is Banks of the Anduin for no effect. The Hill Troll's six attack does no damage to Beregond and I use Unexpected Courage to refresh him.

 

In retaliation, Legolas, Beregond and the Eagles of the Misty Mountains attack for six, doing three damage to the Hill Troll and leaving it on seven wounds.

 

At the end of the round I refresh all my cards and increase my threat to thirty five.

 

As turn five begins I add a resource to each of my heroes and draw Radagast.

 

In the planning stage I spend the two resources on Eowyn to play Arwen Undomiel.

 

In the Quest phase I exhaust and commit Eowyn for four and Arwen Undomiel for two, adding one defence to Beregond, then commit Legolas for one making a total willpower of seven.

 

The staging draw is Misty Mountain Goblins for a total threat of two. Of the five progress made, two explores Necromancers Pass and the other three are ignored.

 

As there are no locations in the staging area the encounter phase means that I engage the Misty Mountain Goblins.

 

At the start of the combat phase I add a shadow card to the Hill Troll and the Misty Mountain Goblins who both engage Beregond. The Hill Troll's shadow card is Misty Mountain Goblins, which removes one progress from Stage 1A. The Hill Troll's six attack does no damage compared to Beregond's buffed seven defence.

 

I use Unexpected Courage to refresh Beregond then the Misty Mountain Goblins attack him, removing another progress from stage 1A. The shadow card is Gladden Fields, no effect. The Goblin's two attack does nothing.

 

Legolas and the Eagles of the Misty Mountains attack the Hill Troll for five attack, doing two damage and finally killing it.

 

The Hill Troll goes into my Victory Display, earning four Victory Points and Legolas adds two progress to stage 1A finishing it.

 

Moving on to stage 2B I have to reveal two cards in the quest phase and I can only optionally engage enemies. I have to put sixteen progress on the quest to progress,

 

To end turn five I refresh all my cards and increase my threat to thirty six.

 

At the start of turn six I add one resource to all my heroes and draw Support of the Eagles.

 

During planning I spend two resources from Beregond to play Citadel Plate on Beregond.

 

In the Quest phase I exhaust and commit Eowyn for four and Arwen Undomiel for two, adding one defence to Beregond, then commit Legolas for one making a total willpower of seven.

 

The staging draws are, firstly Eastern Crows for one threat which surges to another Hill Troll (darn it) for one threat. The second draw is another Necromancers Pass for three, giving a threat total of five. Two progress is placed on stage 2B.

 

In the travel phase I travel to Necromancers Pass, discarding Support of the Eagles and one of the Radagast's in my hand.

 

I choose not to optionally engage any enemies so the combat phase begins with me putting a shadow card on Misty Mountain Goblins before they attack Beregond, removing one progress from phase 2B. The shadow card is Massing at Night, which tells me to draw another shadow card. The second shadow card is The Brown Lands for no effect. The Misty Mountain Goblins do two attack against Beregond's seven defence,

 

Legolas and the Eagles of the Misty Mountains kill the Misty Mountains Goblins and add two progress to Necromancers Pass, exploring it.

 

At the end of turn six I refresh all my cards and increase my threat to thirty seven.

 

As turn seven begins I add a resource to all my heroes and draw Horn of Gondor.

 

In the planning phase I spend one resource from Legolas to play the Horn of Gondor on Eowyn and three resources from Legolas and one resource from Eowyn and Beregond to play Radagast. This also empties my hand.

 

The quest phase sees me exhaust and commit Eowyn for four, Arwen Undomiel for two and Radagast for two as well as committing Legolas for one, giving me a total of nine.

 

The staging draws are Evil Storm, which does one damage to all my characters and Treacherous Fog, which has no effect. This means a total threat of two and seven progress going on stage 2B, leaving me on eight of sixteen needed progress.

 

In the encounter phase I optionally engage the Eastern Crows. They gain a shadow card and attack Beregond. The shadow card is another Eastern Crows and makes their attack two against Beregond's buffed seven defence.

 

In return, Legolas attacks and kills the Eastern Crows, adding two progress to stage 2B and the Horn of Gondor adds one resource to Eowyn. The Eastern Crows are shuffled back into the encounter deck.

 

After refreshing all my cards I increase my threat to thirty eight.

 

At the start of turn eight I add one resource to all my heroes and draw Gandalf (Core).

 

In planning I spend all the resources on Beregond, Eowyn and Legolas to play Gandalf then use his ability to draw three cards, Eagles of the Misty Mountains, Rivendell Blade and Song of Travel. I then spend one resource from Eowyn to play Song of Travel on Legolas.

 

In the quest phase I exhaust and commit Eowyn for four, Arwen Undomiel for two and Radagast for two as well as committing Legolas for one, giving me a total of nine.

 

The staging draws are Wolf Rider for one who surges, Gladden Fields for three and Pursued By Shadow which increases my threat to forty one. I'm really heart-sick of the lack of encounter negation cards I've drawn. The threat total is five meaning that four progress goes on Stage 2B.

 

In the Travel phase I travel to Gladden Fields.

 

I decide to optionally engage the Hill Troll, who then gains a shadow card before attacking Beregond. The shadow card is Enchanted Stream, which does nothing. The Hill Troll's six attack is repulsed by Beregond's seven defence.

 

In retaliation Legolas, Eagles of the Misty Mountains and Gandalf attack the Hill Troll for nine, doing seven damage and leaving it with two wounds left.

 

At the end of the round all my cards refresh and Gandalf leaves play. My threat then increases (thanks to Gladden Fields) to forty three.

 

Turn nine begins with me adding one resource to all my heroes and drawing Song of Battle.

 

In the planning phase I spend one resource from Legolas to play Rivendell Blade on him, then spend one resource from Beregond to play Song of Battle on Eowyn.

 

In the quest phase I exhaust and commit Eowyn, Radagast and Arwen Undomiel and commit Legolas for a total of nine willpower. The staging draws are another Gladden Fields for three and Goblin Sniper for two. The total threat is six so three progress explores Gladden Fields.

 

In the travel phase I don't travel. I then decide not to optionally engage any enemies which brings me to the combat phase. The Hill Troll gains a shadow card and attacks Beregond. The shadow card is The Necromancers Reach for no effect. The Hill Troll's six attack does nothing to Beregond.

 

Legolas, using the Rivendell Blade to knock the Hill Troll's defence to one, attacks the Hill Troll with the Eagle of the Misty Mountains and kills it. Legolas's ability adds two progress to stage 2B and completes it as well as adding a resource to Eowyn through Horn of Gondor. The Hill Troll goes into the Victory display and gives me a total of eight victory points.

 

Stage 3B tells me to add two cards to the staging area Defiance, which does nothing and Treacherous Fog, which makes me discard the Eagles of the Misty Mountains from my hand. I also skip the staging step of the Quest phase from now on. All I have to do is kill the Goblin Sniper and the Wolf Rider to complete the quest.

 

At the end of the combat phase the Goblin Sniper does one damage to Beregond before I refresh all my cards and increase my threat to forty four.

 

Turn ten begins with me adding one resource to all my heroes and drawing another Arwen Undomiel.

 

Since I already have a Arwen in play I skip the planning and travel stages and exhaust and commit Eowyn (then discard the Arwen in my hand to add one willpower) and Radagast for a total of seven willpower.

 

The threat total in the staging area is still five so no progress is made.

 

In the encounter stage the Wolf Rider engages me.

 

In the combat phase the Wolf Rider gains a shadow card. The Wolf Rider attacks Beregond and the shadow card is Evil Storm for no effect. The Wolf Rider's two attack is insufficient to damage Beregond. In response, Legolas kills him, adding one resource to Eowyn thanks to Horn of Gondor.

 

At the end of the combat round the Goblin Sniper does one damage to Radagast before I refresh all my cards and increase my threat to 45.

 

At the start of turn eleven I add one resource to all my heroes and draw Radagast.

 

I skip the planning and travel stages and exhaust and commit Eowyn (then discard the Radagast in my hand to add one willpower) and Radagast for a total of seven willpower.

 

The total threat is five so no progress is made. In the encounter phase I engage the Goblin Sniper.

 

After adding a shadow card, the Goblin Sniper attacks Beregond. The shadow card is Chieftain Ufthak for no effect. The Goblin Sniper does two attack against Beregond's seven defence, then Legolas kills it, ending the game.

 

This quest was a lot tougher than Passage Through Mirkwood, mostly because I was lacking in certain cards. I think I'll stick with this deck when I tackle Escape From Dol Goldur.

 

In the end, the score was:

 

Completed turns (11): 110

Threat: 45

Damage on surviving heroes: 7.

Victory Points: 8.

Total: 154.

I just realised from watching one of the Cardboard of the Rings game videos on Youtube that I've been playing Horn of Gondor for years :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]. Basically I've been counting dead enemies as characters but from the sound of it that's wrong.

Gosh darn it to heck. I use Horn of Gondor all the time and never noticed that enemies aren't characters. I must have read it in the rules but it mustn't have stuck.

## 171 [silverthorn on October 28, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1314738)

GAME 139 – ESCAPE FROM DOL GOLDUR

Heroes: Beregond, Eowyn, Legolas

 

For this game I made some changes to the deck, removing the Eagles for other cards and putting some wound negation cards and more threat reduction cards into the deck. Although Dol Goldur is one of the more difficult quests I hope the changes might work.

 

As per usual, my starting threat is twenty eight. My starting hand is Bofur, Veteran Axehand, Gondorian Shield, Gondorian Spearman, another Gondorian Spearman and Elrond's Counsel. Despite my not knowing who I'll have available at the start of the game I'll stick with this hand.

 

Stage 1A tells me to search for the three Objective cards and put them into the staging area. Since all three have Guarded I have to place a card from the top of the Encounter Deck on each of them, Gandalf's Map gains Hummerhorns, Dungeon Torch gains Under the Shadow which has no effect and is discarded and Shadow Key gains Endless Caverns, which increases my threat to twenty nine and surges, adding Eyes of the Forest. It discards the Elrond's Counsel from my hand.

 

Flipping to Stage 1B, I have to randomly select one of my heroes to be a captive. The random selection is Beregond, which is pretty much the second worst possible option. Thankfully I put a few good defensive allies into the deck.

 

With a feeling that this is not going to end well, I move on to turn one.

 

Turn one begins with me adding one resource to all my heroes and drawing Close Call. In the planning phase I do nothing.

 

In the Quest phase I exhaust and commit Eowyn for a total of four willpower. The Staging draw is Caught In A Web, which only makes things more complicated as it means I have to select a hero to only be able to refresh if I spend two resources from him. This will have to go on Legolas. The threat total is two meaning that two progress goes onto Stage 1B. 

 

In the Travel phase I travel to Endless Caverns.

 

The Hummerhorns engagement cost is higher than my threat so it stays in the staging area so I skip the combat phase before refreshing Eowyn and increasing my threat to thirty.

 

Turn Two begins with me adding a resource to my heroes and drawing Rivendell Blade, a useless item because it will only play on Legolas.

 

In the planning phase I spend the two resources on Legolas to play Veteran Axehand.

 

In the Quest phase I again exhaust and commit Eowyn for four willpower. The staging draw is Dungeon Jailer for a total threat of two, meaning that I add two of three progress to Endless Caverns.

 

Since both the Dungeon Jailer and the Hummerhorns have higher threat values than mine I don't optionally engage them and after refreshing Eowyn increase my threat to thirty one and end the turn. 

 

Turn three begins with me adding a resource to my heroes and drawing Black Arrow, another currently useless attachment. 

 

The planning phase passes without incident and in the quest phase I exhaust and commit Eowyn again for a total of four willpower. The staging draw is Cavern Guardian who increases my threat to and makes a total threat of four. No progress is made.

 

In the encounter phase the Cavern Guardian's threat is low enough that he engages me, adding a shadow card. The shadow card is Mountains of Mirkwood for no effect as he attacks the Veteran Axehand. His two attack does one of two wounds on the Veteran Axehand and after refreshing my cards and increasing my threat to thirty three the turn ends.

 

As turn four begins I again add one resource to my heroes and draw Elrond's Counsel, a handy card at this point.

 

As the planning phase commences I do nothing so play proceeds to the quest phase where I commit Eowyn for four and play Elrond's Counsel to boost my willpower to five and lower my threat to thirty. The staging draw is Necromancers Pass for a total threat of five. Again,, no progress is made.

 

In the encounter phase the enemies in the staging area have higher threat's than mine so they stay there for now and play proceeds to the combat phase where I add a shadow card to the Cavern Guardian. He attacks the Veteran Axehand and the shadow card is Enchanted Stream for no effect. The two damage is enough to kill the Veteran Axehand before Legolas attacks the Cavern Guardian for three, killing him and adding two progress, one explores the Endless Caverns, releasing the Shadow Key. I increase my threat to thirty two to attach the Shadow Key to Legolas, who will now take a point of damage every turn.

 

At the end of the turn I spend the two resources on Legolas to refresh him then add one wound from the Shadow Key, refresh Eowyn and increase my threat to thirty three whilst hoping that I might draw a Spirit card next turn.

 

As turn five begins I add a resource to my heroes and draw another Gondorian Spearman. It appears that the fates are conspiring against me.

 

In the planning stage I play the Black Arrow and Rivendell Blade on Legolas for a total of one resource from Legolas.

 

In the Quest phase I risk exhausting Eowyn and Legolas for a total of five willpower. The staging draw is another Caught In A Web. This has to go onto Eowyn and it pretty much cripples my heroes. On the something resembling bright side it makes for a total threat of five so I don't actually lose the quest phase.

 

In the travel phase I travel to Necromancers Pass and discard two random cards, namely Gondorian Spearman and Close Call. Wondering if this game can actually get any worse, I bypass the encounter and combat phases before adding a damage to Legolas and spending two resources from Eowyn to refresh her before increasing my threat to thirty four.

 

Turn six begins with me adding a resource to all my heroes and drawing A Test Of Will. While it's a Spirit card it's also a card which is conditional. Regardless I proceed to the Planning phase where I risk spending the two resources on Legolas to play a Gondorian Spearman.

 

In the quest phase I exhaust and commit Eowyn for a total of four willpower. The staging draw is The Necromancers Reach, which I spend one resource from Eowyn to play A Test Of Will to get rid of. The total threat is two so I make 2 progress, exploring the Necromancer's Pass.

 

Bypassing the encounter and combat phases, I end turn six by increasing Legolas's damage to three of four wounds and spending two of Eowyn's resources to refresh her before increasing my threat to thirty five.

 

As turn seven commences I add a resource to my heroes and draw Spear of the Citadel. I'm pretty sure I actually put Spirit cards into this fershlugging deck. Regardless, I proceed to planning where nothing happens.

 

In the quest phase I again exhaust Eowyn for four willpower. The staging draw is another Endless Caverns which increases my threat to thirty six and surges, adding Mountains of Mirkwood to the staging area. The total threat is five, meaning that I have unsuccessfully quested, meaning that Dungeon Jailer's text kicks in shuffling the unclaimed Dungeon Torch back into the encounter deck. 

 

At this point, with Legolas about to die at the end of the turn and no light at the end of the tunnel (unless it's a Uruk with a flamethrower). I decided to concede the game. I'm going to build a Leadership/Lore deck and try this baby two-handed since I honestly can't figure out how to beat it single player.

GAME 140 - ESCAPE FROM DOL GOLDUR
Heroes: Beravor, Eowyn and Legolas & Aragorn, Bifur and Theodred

 

I've give up on the whole writing up the games since it turns a fun half-hour or so into four or five hours of soul-crushing writing. Suffice to say that playing the game two-handed made it winnable although it did end up with Bifur both the prisoner at the start and dead at the end. alongside Beregond. All in all, a hard-won victory and a pair of decks which will probably need some modification although I'm starting to think that it's just that my card draws were appalng in both games.

## 173 [silverthorn on October 30, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1316630)

GAME 141 - PASSAGE THROUGH MIRKWOOD (PROGRESSION)

Heroes: Denethor, Eowyn, Gimli.

I managed to complete this quest using only core set cards while forgetting completely about putting Unexpected Courage on Denethor so that he could scry for the next card to go into the staging area. The deck is a little rough but the hero combo seems to work.

## 174 [silverthorn on October 30, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1317182)

GAME 142 - HUNT FOR GOLLUM

Heroes: Beravor, Eowyn and Legolas & Aragorn, Bifur and Theodred

This game went a lot better than the previous couple of games. Cards turned up when I needed them (including a Light of Valinor which went on Legolas on turn one and I completely forgot about until the last turn when I was one willpower short of completing the game and I noticed it  :o [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_ohmy.png]  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]  :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]  :rolleyes: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_rolleyes.gif] ). All in all, the Leadership/Lore deck was rolling out twenty four willpower per turn by the end of the game (thanks to Sword that was Broken and Faramir). As it turns out I was right about the decks being not so much flawed as just my having really bad luck with card draw.

## 175 [silverthorn on November 1, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1318904)

GAME 143 - CONFLICT AT THE CARROCK

Heroes: Beravor, Eowyn and Legolas & Aragorn, Bifur and Theodred

This was a struggle, I decided to hold off on using the four Core Gandalf's split between my decks to wound the Trolls as they came down one at a time into combat with Legolas's deck. All in all, it went well but I'm pretty much back to playing decks which I've used a lot in the past. I'm working on a solo deck with Gandalf as a hero and probably a completely different deck for the next game i play.

## 176 [silverthorn on November 2, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1319612)

GAME 144 - A JOURNEY TO RHOSGOBEL

Heroes: Aragorn (Lore), Gandalf, Glorfindel.

I decided going into building this deck that (a) I would build a solo deck using Gandalf and (b) I would not use Legolas and Eowyn since they have been in just about all the decks I've built for this challenge. As it turns out the deck worked well, Gandalf is possibly wildly over-powerful and allowed me to win the game. In the end Wilyador was one ten wounds (after sacrificing two Wardens of Healing and a Daughter of Nimrodel to heal him and I had two Athalos so I scraped a win by powering through the stages as quickly as I could. Getting Asfaloth as the top card of the deck on turn one probably turned it from a narrow defeat into a narrow win.

 

My score was:

Rounds (5): 50

Threat: 36

Damage: 2 (on Aragorn)

VP: 2 (2 Flame of Arnor)

Total; 84.

## 177 [silverthorn on November 8, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1326397)

GAME 145 - HILLS OF EMYN MULL
Heroes:  Aragorn (Lore), Gandalf, Glorfindel.

This one was a drag because of the amount of enemies I had to deal with. Gandalf is wildly over-powerful. By the end of the game I had 16 cards in hand and 9 allies in play. My score was:

 

Completed Turns (11): 110

Threat: 32

Damage: 0

VP: 22.

Total: 120.

## 178 [silverthorn on November 9, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1328119)

GAME 146 - THE DEAD MARSHES

Heroes; Aragorn (Lore), Gandalf, Glorfindel (Spirit).

This one went surprisingly well again, mostly because of Gandalf's massive over-powerfulness. I think I may go for a less broken hero combo next time since I want to try something Ranger-related since Wingfoot looks like a handy card and it gets kind of forgotten in the istari related shenanigans.

## 179 [silverthorn on November 11, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1330969)

GAME 147 - RETURN TO MIRKWOOD

Heroes: Beravor, Boromir (Leadership) and Mablung

This one went catastrophically wrong, Being on 47 threat going into the refresh phase on turn three sealed my fate. I now remember why I tend to avoid Gondor decks like the plague.

## 180 [silverthorn on November 12, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1332067)

GAMES 148 & 149 - RETURN TO MIRKWOOD

Heroes: Haldir of Lorien, Idraen and Mablung

This deck worked but I threated out because of my threat increasing by 4 per turn. I steadily made changes to the deck, learning from my mistakes until.

 

GAME 150 - RETURN TO MIRKWOOD

Heroes: Haldir of Lorien, Idraen and Mablung

I managed to get a win by a massive fluke. I managed to use three Core Gandalf's, three Elrond's Counsel's and two Galadhrim's Greetings to keep my threat low enough to manage to quest through to the end. In the end Mablung managed to survive long enough to complete the quest.

GAME 151 - INTO THE PIT

Heroes: Aragorn (Lore), Frodo Baggins, Glorfindel (Spirit).

This hero combo, thought up on a whim, seemed to work well. Even though I didn't get either Asfaloth or Henamarth Riversong into play the hero combo worked; Aragorn attacks and drops threat from 48 to 24, Frodo quests and takes undefended attacks and Glorfy quests and attacks. All in all, this is possibly the best no Eowyn or Legolas deck I've tried recently. 

 

Turns (7): 70.

Threat: 25.

Dead Hero Threat: 0.

Damage: 0.

VP: 4.

Score: 91.

GAME 152 - THE SEVENTH LEVEL

Heroes: Aragorn (Lore), Frodo Baggins, Glorfindel (Spirit).

This was odd, I hit very few enemies (even with stage 2B's rules) and the game was easier than it's ever been.

 



Turns (9): 90.

Threat: 38.

Dead Hero Threat: 0.

Damage: 0.

VP: 2.

Score: 126.

GAME 153 - STONE OF ERECH

Heroes: Celeborn, Galadriel and Glorfindel & Haldir of Lorien, Legolas & Mirlonde.

These decks are pretty darn strong. I went into the quest completely blind as to what I had in store and lost Legolas and Glorfindel before beating it in 8 turns (I guess, I was not taking notes but I had just swapped in Night so I guess that it was 8 turns). All in all, the decks are pretty nifty and I'm going to go back to the Hobbit mission and try all the quests with them.

I didn't start this until March this year so I've got 4 months to complete it. I'll probably keep writing up my games after I hit 200 games since it's been interesting to read through all the decks I've tried up until now.

GAME 154 – THE FORDS OF ISEN

 

PLAYER SET-UP

 

Heroes: Denethor, Eowyn, Gimli.

Threat: 28.

Starting Hand: Arwen Undomiel, Gandalf (Core), Gondorian Spearman x2, Self-Preservation and Will Of The West, 

Mulligan: A Test Of Will, Daeron's Runes, Gondorian Spearman, Miner of the Iron Hills, Warden Of Healing and Will Of The West. I did a mulligan in the hopes of getting Henamarth Riversong into play, ho hum.

 

QUEST SET-UP

Stage: 1B (0/6 progress, 5 remaining time counters).

Active Location: None.

Staging Area: Dunland Prowler (1) and The Islet (0/1 progress remaining) with Grima attached (1).

 

TURN ONE

 

As the game begins I add 1 resource to all my heroes and draw Imladris Stargazer.

 

At the start of the planning phase I play Daeron's Runes, draw A Test Of Will and Feint and discard Feint. 

 

In the quest phase I commit Eowyn for a total of 4 willpower. The staging area containing Dunland Prowler (2, thanks to my large hand) and The Islet with Grima attached (1) are bolstered by Gap of Rohan (2) for a total threat of 5. My threat increases to 29.

 

in the travel phase I travel to the Islet.

 

In the encounter phase I have a low enough threat that I don't need to engage the Dunland Prowler.

 

At the end of the combat phase I exhaust Denethor to look at the top card in the encounter deck, Dunland Chieftain. I move it to the bottom of the encounter deck. 

 

I move on the refresh phase where my cards refresh and my threat increases to 30. I then remove 1 time counter from Stage 1B.

 

TURN TWO

 

In the resource phase I add a resource to all my heroes and draw Unexpected Courage.

 

During planning I spend 2 resources from Gimli to play Gondorian Spearman, 2 resources from Denethor to play Warden of Healing and 2 resources from Eowyn to play Unexpected Courage on Denethor.

 

In the quest phase I commit Eowyn (4), Denethor (1) then refresh him with Unexpected Courage and the Warden of Healing (1) for a total of 6 willpower.

 

The staging area containing Dunland Prowler (2) and Gap of Rohan (2) is bolstered by Down From The Hills, a treachery which forces me to remove a time counter from stage 1B. 2 progress is made, 1 of which explores the Islet and frees Grima before 1 progress is made on stage 1B. 1 VP is added and the Islet goes into my Victory area.

 

In the travel phase I travel to the Gap of Rohan.

 

In the encounter phase I optionally engage the Dunland Prowler. 

 

During the combat phase the Dunland Prowler gets a shadow card then attacks us as I take it undefended. The shadow card is Wild Men of Dunland for no effect. The attack does 2 damage to Gimli. In return, Gimli, Grima and the Gondorian Spearman attack for 6 (6 attack – 3 defence) doing 3 damage to the Dunland Prowler and killing it. Denethor then exhausts to look at the top encounter card, Old Hatreds which I place at the bottom of the deck.

 

To end the turn I refresh all my cards, increase my threat to 31 and remove a time counter from stage 1B.

 

TURN THREE

 

In the resource phase I add 1 resource to all my heroes and draw Close Call.

 

Since I do nothing in the planning phase I proceed to the quest phase where I commit Denethor (1) then ready him with Unexpected Courage, Eowyn (4), Warden of Healing (1) and Grima (2) for a total willpower of 8. I then discard Will Of The West to add another willpower for a total of 9.

 

The staging draw is Ill Tidings, which I spend 1 resource from Eowyn to play A Test Of Will and cancel it's effects. The total threat is 0 so 9 progress is made, the first 3 explore the Gap of Rohan and the rest explore Stage 1B.

 

Stage 2B means that I need to search the encounter deck for a Dunland enemy. I choose Dunland Prowler. I then put 2 time counters on Stage 2B.

 

Since there are no locations in the staging area I move to the encounter phase where I optionally engage the Dunland Prowler.

 

In the combat phase a shadow card is added to Dunland Prowler and he attacks Denethor. The shadow card is The King's Road, which does nothing. The Dunland Prowler does no damage (2 attack – 3 defence = 0 damage) and Gimli and the Gondorian Spearman attack, doing 2 damage (5 attack – 3 defence = 2 damage). 

 

To end the turn I refresh all my cards and ncrease my threat to 32. I then remove a time counter from stage 2B.

 

TURN FOUR

 

In the resource phase I add a resource to all my heroes and draw Hasty Stroke.

 

In the planning phase I spend 2 resources from Denethor to play Erebor Hammersmith.

 

In the quest phase I exhaust Denethor (1) then refresh him with Unexpected Courage, Eowyn and discard Will Of The West to boost her willpower (5), Warden of Healing (1), Grima (2) and Erebor Hammersmith (1) for a total of 10 willpower.

 

The staging draw is The King's Road (2). 8 progress is added to Stage 2B.

 

In the Travel phase I am forced to travel to the Kings Road.

 

Since there are no enemies in the staging area I proceed directly to the combat phase where I add a shadow card to the Dunland Prowler and declare the Gondorian Spearman as a defender. The Spearman automatically does the fatal 1 damage to the Prowler, killing it and discarding the shadow card, a Dunland Tribesman. I then exhaust Denethor to look at the top card of the encounter deck, Gap of Rohan and return it to the top of the encounter deck.

 

At the end of the turn I refresh all my cards, increase my threat to 33 and remove the last time counter from stage 2B, this does the same damage as the number of cards in my hand, namely 5. I put the whole lot on Gimli, then play Close Call to cancel 3 of them but increase my threat to 36. Another 2 time counters go onto stage 2B.

 

TURN FIVE

 

In the resource phase I add a resource to all my heroes and draw another Warden of Healing.

 

In the planning stage I spend 2 resources from Eowyn to play Imladris Stargazer, then exhaust her to look at the top 5 cards of my deck and rearrange them.

 

In the quest phase I exhaust Denethor (1) then refresh him with Unexpected Courage, Eowyn and discard Miner of the Iron Hills (5), Gimli (2), Warden of Healing (1), Grima (2) and Erebor Hammersmith (1) for a total of 12 willpower.

 

The staging draw, unsurprisingly is Gap of Rohan for 2 threat, leaving me making 10 progress. The first 5 explore the Kings Road and the next 5 go onto stage 2B leaving me with 1 progress to make.

 

After travelling to the Gap of Rohan, I ignore the encounter phase and, at the end of the combat phase exhaust Denethor to see the top card of the encounter deck, Dunland Raider, who goes to the bottom of the encounter deck.

 

At the end of the turn, I refresh all my cards and increase my threat to 34 before removing a time counter from Stage 2B.

 

TURN FIVE

 

To begin with, I add a resource to all my heroes and draw Henamarth Riversong.

 

In the planning phase I spend 1 resource from Denethor to play Henamarth Riversong, I then exhaust Imladris Stargazer to rearrange the top 5 cards in my deck and exhaust Henamarth Riversong to look at the top card of the deck, Dunlanding Bandit.

 

Knowing what is coming my way, I commit Eowyn (4) and Grima (2) for a total of 6 willpower. 

 

Predictably the staging draw is Dunlanding Bandit for a total threat of 2. I make 4 progress, the first 3 explore the Gap of Rohan and the last one explores stage 2B.

 

Stage 3 tells me to search the deck for a Dunland enemy, once again I pick the Dunland Prowler and put 3 time counters on stage 3B.

 

In the encounter phase I am forced to engage both of the enemies in the staging area.

 

As combat begins, both enemies gain a shadow card before the Dunlanding Bandit attacks Denethor. His shadow card has no effect and the attack does 1 damage to Denethor. Unexpected Courage exhausts to ready him in time for the next attack from the Dunland Prowler. His shadow card also has no effect and the attack does no damage.

 

In response, Gimli attacks the Dunlanding Bandit for 6, killing it.

 

At the end of the turn all my cards refresh and my threat increases to 35. I then remove a time counter from stage 3B.

 

TURN SIX

 

To begin the turn I add a resource to all my heroes and draw Arwen Undomiel.

 

In the planning phase I spend 2 resources from Eowyn to play Arwen Undomiel, spend 2 resources from Denethor to play Warden of Healing and exhaust Denthor to look at the top card of the encounter deck, a Dunland Tribesman who goes to the bottom of the encounter deck. I then exhaust Henamarth Riversong to look at the top card of the encounter deck, a Dunlending Bandit.

 

In the Quest phase I commit Eowyn (4), Arwen Undomiel (2) adding her bonus to Gondorian Spearman and Grima (2), both Wardens of Healing (2) and Erebor Hammersmith (1) for a total willpower of 11.

 

The staging draw is Dunlending Bandit for 2 threat, meaning that 9 progress is made towards stage 3B. 

 

After bypassing the travel phase the encounter phase sees me engaged by the Dunlending Bandit.

 

In the combat phase shadow cards are dealt and the Dunlending Bandit attacks the Gondorian Spearman, suffering 1 wound before he kills the Spearman.

 

The Dunland Prowler attacks Denethor, doing no damage. In return, Gimli kills the Dunlending Bandit. At the end of the phase I exhaust Imladris Stargazer to rearrange the top 5 cards of my deck.

 

At the end of the turn I refresh all my cards and increase my threat to 35 and remove a time counter from stage 3B.

 

TURN SEVEN

 

To begin I add a resource to all my heroes then draw Dwarrowdelf Axe (finally a smegging Tactics card).

 

In the planning phase I spend 1 of Gimli's 6 resources to play Dwarrowdelf Axe on him. I then exhaust Denethor to look at the top card of the encounter deck.a Dunland Berserker who goes straight to the bottom of the encounter deck. I then exhaust Unexpected Courage to refresh him before exhausting Henamarth Riversong to look at the new top card, Wild Men Of Dunland. I'm glad I didn't spend the resource on Eowyn.

 

In the quest phase I commit Eowyn (4), Arwen Undomiel (2), putting her bonus on Denethor and Grima (2) for a total threat of 8.

 

The staging draw is Wild Men of Dunland which surges before I spend 1 resource from Eowyn to play A Test Of Will and negate it. The surge card is Pillaging and Burning which makes me draw Gondorian Shield and raises my threat to 37. the threat total is 0 so 8 progress goes onto stage 3B, enough to explore it.

 

All I have to do is kill the Dunland Prowler and the quest's complete. Going into the combat phase I add a shadow card to the Prowler before he attacks Denethor. The shadow card is Dunland Chieftain for no effect and the Prowler does no damage to Denethor before Gimli wallops him for 7 damage, killing him and winning the quest.

 

In the end the score was as follows:

 

Turns (7): 70

Threat: 37

Damage on heroes: 5 (1 on Denethor, 4 on Gimli).

VP: 1 (the Islet).

Total: 111.

 

In conclusion, Denethor is nasty after a readying effect is played on him. The ability to potentially delay nasty encounter cards is excessively useful and his high defence is a bonus. The other heroes did their assigned tasks well and the quest was a slog but never seemed insurmountable. All in all a nice first quest for this deck.

100 games in a month, that's impressive. 


 


GAME 155 – PASSAGE THROUGH MIRKWOOD


 


SET-UP


As will become standard for this run through the scenarios my heroes are Beregond, Eowyn and Legolas for a starting threat of 28. My starting hand is A Test Of Will, Defender of Rammas, Feint, Galadhon Archer, Song of Travel and Spear of the Citadel. I'll keep this hand.


 


The quest set-up is normal for this quest, Forest Spider and Old Forest Gate go in the staging area.


 


TURN ONE


 


To start off I add a resource to all my heroes and draw Black Arrow. In the planning phase I play Black Arrow on Legolas and Spear of the Citadel on Beregond before spending a resource each from Beregond and Legolas to play Galadhon Archer. Her ability does 1 point of damage on the Forest Spider.


 


In the quest phase I commit Eowyn for 4 willpower. The staging draw is Mountains of Mirkwood for a total 5 threat. My threat value increases to 29.


 


in the travel phase I travel to Old Forest Road, using it's ability to refresh Eowyn.


 


After engaging the Forest Spider in the encounter phase the Spider gains a shadow card and attacks Beregond whose Spear of the Citadel does another damage to it. The shadow card is Black Forest Bats and has no effect and the Forest Spider's 3 attack does nothing to Beregond's 4 defence.


 


In retaliation Legolas attacks for 3, killing the Forest Spider and adding 2 progress to Old Forest Road.


 


At the end of the round I refresh my cards and increase my threat to 30.


 


TURN TWO


 


After adding a resource to all my heroes and drawing Gondorian Shield I attach the Gondorian Shield to Beregond the spend a resource from Eowyn to play Song of Travel on Legolas before I spend a resource from Legolas and Beregond to play Defender of Rammas.


 


In the quest phase I commit Eowyn for 4 willpower while the staging draw is another Forest Spider for a total of 4 threat. No progress is made.


 


After skipping the travel phase I engage the Forest Spider and it attacks Beregond, then takes 1 wound because of Beregond's Spear of the Citadel. The Forest Spider's attack of 3 does nothing with Beregond's defence at 6.


 


In return, Legolas and the Galadhon Archer attack for 5, killing the Forest Spider then adding 1 progress to explore the Old Forest Road before adding 1 progress to stage 1B.


 


At the end of the round I refresh my cards then increase my threat to 31.


 


TURN THREE


 


After adding a resource to all my heroes I draw Gondorian Spearman. With the new resource I spend a resource from Legolas and Beregond to play Gondorian Spearman.


 


During Questing I commit Eowyn for 4 willpower and draw another Forest Spider for a total of 4 threat (I did shuffle the encounter deck). No progress is made again.


 


In the travel phase I travel to the Mountains of Mirkwood, drawing the top card of the encounter deck, a King Spider. In the encounter phase I engage both spiders, exhausting the Defender of Rammas and proceed to the combat phase.


 


The King Spider engages Beregond, suffering 1 wound from his Spear of the Citadel while the Forest Spider attacks Gondorian Spearman and also takes 1 wound. The King Spider's 3 attack does nothing to Beregond and the Forest Spider gets a boost of 1 extra attack from Dol Goldur Orcs and overkills the Gondorian Spearman.


 


In return, Legolas attacks the King Spider for 3, killing it and adding 2 progress to Mountains of Mirkwood. The Galadhon Archer attacks for 2, doing 1 damage to the Forest Spider.


 


With a empty staging area I refresh all my cards and increase my threat to 32.


 


TURN FOUR


 


After adding resources I draw Close Call (I did put Spirit cards into the deck) and skip planning. In the quest phase I commit Eowyn for 4 willpower and draw Old Forest Road for 1 threat. I add1 progress to explore Mountains of Mirkwood and 2 progress goes onto Stage 1B. Thanks to Mountains of Mirkwood I can search the top 5 cards of my deck and put 1 into my hand. I choose Ethir Swordsman and shuffle the others into my deck.


 


In the travel phase I travel to Old Forest Road, refreshing Eowyn.


 


Since I have a empty staging area I proceed to the combat phase where the Forest Spider attacks Beregond and suffers a third wound from Beregond's Spear of the Citadel before his 2 attack does nothing to the Gondorian defensive behemoth.


 


On the counter-attack Legolas kills the Forest Spider and adds 2 progress to Old Forest Road before I refresh all my cards and increase my threat to 33.


 


TURN FIVE


 


After adding resources and drawing Boromir I spend 2 resources from Eowyn to play Ethir Swordsman and 2 resources each from Beregond and Legolas to play Boromir.


 


During Questing I commit Eowyn and the Ethir Swordsman for a total of 6 willpower before drawing Dol Goldur Orcs for a total of 2 threat. I would have had to take 2 damage on Eowyn but I play Close Call to increase my threat to 35 instead. 1 progress explores the Old Forest Road and the other 3 progress goes onto stage 1B leaving me with 2 progress left.


 


In the encounter phase I engage the Dol Goldur Orcs who proceed to attack Beregond, taking 1 damage from Beregond's sharp pointy stick and doing nothing to the Gondor hero. In return, Legolas attacks and kills the Dol Goldur Orcs, his ability adding the 2 progress needed to proceed to stage 2.


 


At the end of the round I refresh everything and increase my threat to 36.


 


TURN SIX


 


After adding resources I draw Guthlaf before spending 1 resource each from Beregond and Legolas to play Guthlaf.


 


During the quest phase I commit Eowyn, Ethir Swordsman and Guthlaf for a total willpower of 7. Against this I draw East Bight Patrol for a total of 3. Of the 4 progress I made, 2 explored Stage 2B and the rest is lost. I then randomly select a Stage 3. I hit lucky, drawing Beorn's Path.


 


Since there are no locations in the staging area I proceed to the encounter phase where I have to engage the East Bight Patrol.


 


The East Bight Patrol attacks Beregond, taking 1 damage and doing nothing to Beregond. Again, Legolas attacks and kills the East Bight Patrol, adding 2 of 10 progress to stage 3B before I refresh everything and increase my threat to 37.


 


TURN SEVEN


 


After adding resources I draw Core Gandalf before again skipping planning.


 


In the quest phase I commit Eowyn, Ethir Swordsman and Guthlaf for a total of 7 willpower. Against this I draw Hummerhorns for a total of 1 threat. 6 progress goes onto stage 3B for a total of 8 of 10 progress.


 


In the encounter phase I ignore the Hummerhorns and skip the combat phase before refreshing my cards and increasing my threat to 38.


 


TURN EIGHT


After adding resources I draw Galadriel's Handmaiden before spending 2 resources from Eowyn to play Galadriel's Handmaiden, reducing my threat to 37, then spend 1 resource from Eowyn and 2 resources each from Beregond and Legolas to play Gandalf. I then use his ability to do 4 damage to the Hummerhorns, killing them.


 


In the quest phase I commit Eowyn, Ethir Swordsman, Guthlaf, Galadriel's Handmaiden and Gandalf for a impressive 13 willpower. Against this I draw The Necromancer's Reach which does 1 damage to Eowyn, Guthlaf and Gandalf and outright kills Ethir Swordsman and Galadriel's Handmaiden. My reduced willpower is 9 against the staging area's 0 meaning that I add 9 progress stage 3B, exploring it and winning the game.


 


In conclusion this deck works well against arguably the easiest quest in the game. Beregond is ridiculous once you get his shield and stick on him and Legolas didn't get a chance to do much more than kill enemies with his basic abilities after I put a few toys into the deck for him to use. Eowyn did what Eowyn always does, quested like her life depended on it and Boromir pretty much did nothing at all. He may be card box bound if he doesn't at least do something in the next couple of games.


 


My score was as follows:


 


Completed Turns (8): 80


Threat: 37


Wounds: 1 (on Eowyn due to the last turn Necromancer's Reach).


VP: 0


Total: 117.


## 190 [silverthorn on November 26, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1347650)

GAME 156 – JOURNEY DOWN THE ANDUIN

 

As per usual my heroes are Beregond, Eowyn and Legolas for a total starting threat of 28. My initial starting hand is Feint, Galadriel's Handmaiden, Close Call, another Close Call, Guthlaf and another Galadriel's Handmaiden. Due to the lack of a Gondorian Shield I mulligan, drawing Unexpected Courage, Arwen Undomiel, Song of Travel, Hasty Stroke, Horn of Gondor and Citadel Plate. This is probably a worse hand than the one I mulligan'd but I'll have to hope it works.

 

Stage 1A tells me to draw the top card of the encounter deck. It is Banks of the Anduin, a 1 threat location. Stage 1B tells me to search the encounter deck for a Hill Troll and put it into the staging area. This is not good since it will attack me in turn three at the latest. 

 

TURN ONE

After adding a resource to all my heroes and drawing Feint (which will come in handy when the Hill Troll engages me) I spend 1 resource from Beregond to play Song of Travel on Legolas then spent 1 resource each from Legolas and Eowyn to play Arwen Undomiel.

 

Proceeding to the quest phase I commit Eowyn and Arwen (adding the defence bonus to Beregond) for a total willpower of 6.

 

Against that the staging draw is Eastern Crows which surges to Gladden Fields for a total threat of 6. No progress is made.

 

In the travel phase I travel to the Gladden Fields, 

 

After optionally engaging the Eastern Crows they attack Beregond. The shadow card has no effect and they do no damage. Legolas then attacks the Eastern Crows and easily kills them, adding 2 of 3 progress to the Gladden Fields.

 

At the end of the round I refresh all my cards and (thanks to Gladden Fields) increase my threat to 30.

 

TURN TWO

 

As usual I add a resource to all my heroes and draw Black Arrow, a handy card considering who will be attacking this turn.

 

In the planning phase I play the Black Arrow on Legolas then spend a resource from Legolas and Beregond to play Plate Armour on Beregond.

 

In the quest phase I commit Eowyn and Arwen (putting her defence bonus on Beregond) for a total of 6 willpower. Against that the 2 threat in the staging area is bolstered by Pursued By Shadow, a nasty 0 threat treachery which increases my threat to 32. The total threat is 2, which means that 4 progress is made. 1 progress explores Gladden Fields and nets me 3 VP before the next 3 progress goes onto stage 1B.

 

In the travel phase I travel to the Banks of the Anduin, then the Hill Troll engages me in the encounter phase.

 

The Hill Troll attacks Beregond, the Shadow card, Massing At Night adds another shadow card, which has no effect before the Hill Troll's 6 attack does 1 wound to Beregond.

 

In response, Legolas attacks the Hill Troll, using the Black Arrow to boost his attack to 8, He does 5 of 9 damage to the Hill Troll and gains another VP from the Black Arrow.

 

At the end of the turn my cards refresh and my threat increases to 33.

 

TURN THREE

 

After adding resources and drawing Defender of Rammas I spend 2 resources from Eowyn to play Unexpected Courage on Beregond and 1 resource from Beregond to play Horn of Gondor on Eowyn.

 

In the quest phase I commit Eowyn and Arwen (adding the defence bonus to Beregond) for a total willpower of 6. Against this the empty staging area is bolstered by The Brown Lands, a 5 threat location which means that I only make 1 of 3 progress towards Banks of the Anduin.

 

I then skip the travel and encounter phases and move to the combat phase where the Hill Troll attacks Beregond again. With a useless shadow card, the Troll does 1 more damage to Beregond, who exhausts Unexpected Courage to refresh.

 

Legolas and Beregond then attack the Hill Troll, doing another damage to it before all my cards refresh and I increase my threat to 34.

 

TURN FOUR

 

After adding resources I draw Boromir before spending 1 resource each from Beregond and Legolas to play Defender from Rammas.

 

In the quest phase I commit Eowyn and Arwen (adding the defence bonus to Beregond) for a total willpower of 6. Against this I draw Evil Storm and hit lucky that my threat is 1 below the threshold for the card to effect me. The total threat is 5, meaning that another progress is made Banks of the Anduin.

 

Again skipping the travel and encounter phases the Hill Troll attacks Beregond again but I spend 1 resource from Legolas to play Feint and stop the attack. Beregond, Legolas and the Defender from Rammas attack the Hill Troll doing the 2 damage needed to kill it and adding another 4 VP as well as making 2 more progress. 1 progress explores Banks of the Anduin and returns it to the top of the encounter deck and 1 progress goes onto Stage 1B.

 

At the end of the turn I refresh everything then increase my threat to 35.

 

TURN FIVE

 

After adding resources I draw Rivendell Blade before spending 1 resource from Legolas to play the Rivendell Blade on him.

 

In the quest phase I commit Eowyn, Legolas and Arwen (adding the defence bonus to Beregond) for a total willpower of 7. Against this I draw Banks of the Anduin for a total threat of 6. 1 progress goes onto stage 1B.

 

In the travel phase I travel to and automatically explore The Brown Lands.

 

Skipping the encounter and combat phases I refresh all my cards and increase my threat to 36.

 

TURN SIX

 

After adding resources I draw Guthlaf before spending 1 resource each from Legolas and Beregond to pay for Guthlaf.

 

In the questing phase I commit Eowyn, Arwen (adding her defence bonus to Beregond, as usual) and Guthlaf for a total of 7 willpower. In opposition I draw Misty Mountain Goblins for a total of 3 threat. 5 progress is made, 3 of which finally explores Stage 1B.

 

Stage 2B is different, I have to draw 2 cards a turn and can only optionally engage enemies. I also have to make 16 progress to proceed to stage 3.

 

With that in mind I use the travel phase to travel to Banks of the Anduin and use the encounter phase to engage the Misty Mountain Goblins. They would have stripped a progress if they had arrived later but now it's less dangerous.

 

The Misty Mountain Goblins attack Beregond and do nothing to him. In return, Legolas attacks and kills them, adding 2 of 3 progress onto Banks of the Anduin.

 

At the end of the turn, my cards refresh and my threat increases to 37.

 

TURN SEVEN

 

After adding resources and drawing The Galadhrim's Greeting I spend 3 resources from Eowyn to play The Galadhrim's Greeting and reduce my threat to 31.

 

In the questing phase I commit Eowyn, Arwen (adding her defence bonus to Beregond, as usual) and Guthlaf for a total of 7 willpower. On the other hand I draw Goblin Sniper and The Necromancer's Reach which does 1 damage to Eowyn, Arwen and Guthlaf. Despite this I quest for 5 progress. 1 explores Banks of the Anduin and I gain 4 of 16 progress towards stage 2B. Banks of the Anduin goes to the top of the encounter deck.

 

I skip the travel phase and opt to engage the Goblin Sniper who attacks Beregond. His attack does nothing and Legolas kills the Sniper to gain a total of 6 of 16 progress towards stage 2B.

 

At the end of the turn I refresh everything and increase my threat to 32.

 

TURN EIGHT

 

After adding resources I draw another Defender of Rammas. In the planning stage I spend 2 resources each from Beregond and Legolas to pay for Boromir.

 

In the quest phase I commit Eowyn, Arwen (adding her bonus to Beregond), Boromir and Guthlaf for a total of 8 willpower.  The staging cards were The East Bight and Enchanted Stream for a total threat of 3, meaning that another 5 progress went onto Stage 1B putting me on 11 of 16 progress. I then travelled to the East Bight,

 

I finally refreshed and increased my threat to 33.

 

TURN NINE

 

After adding resources I draw another Arwen Undomiel then spend 1 resource each from Beregond and Legolas to play another Defender of Rammas.

 

n the quest phase I commit Eowyn, Arwen (adding her bonus to Beregond), Boromir and Guthlaf for a total of 8 willpower. The staging cards are another The Necromancer's Reach which does 1 damage to Eowyn and Boromir (readying him) and outright kills Arwen Undomiel and Guthlaf (netting Eowyn 2 more resources). The next card is Dol Goldur Orcs. After the losses I suffered my total willpower is 5 against 4 threat. 1 progress is added to The East Bight.

 

In the Encounter phase I engage the Dol Goldur Orcs then kill one of my Defenders of Rammas (adding a resource to Eowyn).. The Dol Goldur Orcs then attack Beregond. Even with Wargs as a shadow card they do no damage

 

In return, Legolas attacks and kills the Dol Goldur Orcs, adding 2 more progress to The East Bight.

 

With my ranks reduced I refresh everything before increasing my threat to 34.

 

TURN TEN

 

After adding resources I draw Song of Battle before spending 2 resources from Eowyn to play Arwen Undomiel again.

 

In the quest phase I commit Eowyn, Boromir and Arwen (adding her defence buff to Beregond) for a total of 7 willpower. The staging cards are Dol Goldur Orcs again and Pursued By Shadow, which  increases my threat to 37. The total threat is 4, which means I make 3 progress, enough to explore the East Bight.

 

In the travel phase I travel to the Enchanted Stream before using the encounter phase to engage the Dol Goldur Orcs, which kills the other Defender of Rammas (adding a resource to Eowyn).. The Dol Goldur Orcs attack Beregond and, even with a attack buff do nothing to him. In response Legolas does his thing and kills them to explore the Enchanted Stream.

 

At the end of the turn I refresh everything and increase my threat to 38.

 

TURN ELEVEN

 

Geez, anyway. After adding resources I draw Core Gandalf. I then spend 1 resource from Beregond and 2 resources each from Eowyn and Legolas to play Gandalf. I then use his ability to draw 3 cards, namely two Close Calls and a Gondorian Spearman. I then spend 2 resources from Beregond to play Gondorian Spearman.

 

In the quest phase I commit Eowyn, Arwen Undomiel (who buffs Beregond), Boromir and Gandalf for a total of 11 willpower. The staging draws are Gladden Fields and Banks of the Anduin for a total threat of 4. 7 progress goes onto stage 2B, completing it.

 

Stage 3B makes me draw 2 encounter cards, Misty Mountain Goblins and Necromancers Pass. I basically need to kill the Misty Mountain Goblins to win the quest.

 

In the travel phase I travel to the Gladden Fields before optionally engaging the Misty Mountain Goblins who attack Beregond. Their shadow card does nothing and the Goblins bounce off Beregond's defence. In response Legolas attacks and kills the Goblins to finally finish the quest.

 

In conclusion, once again my heroes did what they were supposed to do and everything went according to plan, if a little slowly. The score was as follows:

 

Turns (11):  110

Threat: 38

Damage: 4

VP: 8

Total Score: 144

GAME 157 – ESCAPE FROM DOL GOLDUR


 


For this, probably the most difficult quest in the game I use my standard Beregond, Eowyn and Legolas combo giving me a starting threat of 28. My starting hand is Defender of Rammas, Gandalf (Core), Citadel Plate, Guthlaf, Galadhon Archer and Spear of the Citadel. Since I have no idea what hero will be captured I keep this one.


 


Stage 1A tells me to place the three objective cards, guarded into the staging area; Dungeon Torch is guarded by Enchanted Stream, Shadow Key guarded by Dol Goldur Beastmaster and Gandalf's Map guarded by Driven By Shadow. This is only getting worse.


 


Stage 1B makes things even worse by having one of my heroes be captured; after random selection processes I wind up with Legolas as the captive, which is all kinds of bad. Guessing that this will end badly and quickly I proceed onwards.


 


TURN ONE


 


After adding resources I draw Galadriel's Handmaiden before I play a discounted Spear of the Citadel on Beregond.


 


In the quest phase I commit Eowyn for 4 willpower. The staging draw is Iron Shackles, which goes on top of my deck but adds no threat. Since the threat total is 4 I add no progress.


 


In the travel phase I travel to Enchanted Stream with Dungeon Torch.


 


In the encounter phase I do not optionally engage anyone so there is no combat phase and I end the turn by refreshing my cards and increasing my threat to 29.


 


TURN TWO


 


After adding resources I discard Iron Shackles instead of drawing a card. I then spend 2 resources from Beregond to play Galadhon Archer and add 1 wound to Dol Goldur Beastmaster. I then spend 2 resources from Eowyn to play Galadriel's Handmaiden which reduces my threat back to 28.


 


in the quest phase I commit Eowyn and Galadriel's Handmaiden for 6 willpower. The staging draw is Dol Goldur Orcs for a total of 4 threat. 2 progress is made, which explored Enchanted Stream and means that I increase my threat back to 30 and attach it to Beregond.


 


Skipping the travel phase I optionally engage the Dol Goldur Orcs who attack Beregond and take 1 of 3 wounds from the Spear of the Citadel. The Orcs attack of 2 bounces off Beregond's 4 defence before the Galadhon Archer kills them with her 2 attack.


 


At the end of the turn I refresh everything and increase my threat to 33.


 


TURN THREE


 


After adding resources I draw Song of Battle and proceed to the planning stage where I do nothing.


 


In the quest phase I commit Eowyn and Galadriel's Handmaiden for 6 willpower. The staging draw is Eyes of the Forest which forces me to discard nothing from my hand. The 2 total threat means that I make 4 of 9 progress towards stage 2.


 


Again skipping the travel phase I proceed to the encounter phase where I risk engaging the Dol Goldur Beastmaster. He then attacks Beregond and suffers a wound from Beregond's Spear, the Cavern Guardian shadow card returning Dungeon Torch to the staging area before Dol Goldur Beastmaster does no damage to Beregond.


 


Galadhon Archer then attacks the Dol Goldur Beastmaster, doing another point of damage to him.


 


To end the round I refresh my cards and put my threat up to 34.


 


TURN FOUR


 


After adding resources I draw Boromir before I spend 2 resources from Beregond to play Guthlaf.


 


In the quest phase I exhaust Eowyn, Galadriel's Handmaiden and Guthlaf for a total of 7 willpower. Against this I draw Hummerhorns for 1 threat. The 6 progress is enough to explore Stage 1B but I need to get one of the Objective cards to finish the stage.


 


I then skip travel and encounter, proceeding directly to the combat phase where the Dol Goldur Beastmaster attacks Beregond, taking another wound from Beregond's beating stick. The two shadow cards are useless and the Beastmaster does no damage. To deliver the coup de grace the Galadhon Archer, who has really delivered the goods so far this game, does the last point of damage to kill the Dol Goldur Beastmaster before I attach Gandalf's Map to Eowyn, raising my threat to 36 and moving on to stage 2B.


 


At the end of the round I refresh all my cards and increase my threat to 37.


 


TURN FIVE


 


To start off with I add a resource to my heroes and draw Gondorian Spearman before spending 1 resource from Eowyn to play Song Of Battle on her.


 


n the quest phase I exhaust Eowyn, Galadriel's Handmaiden and Guthlaf for a total of 7 willpower. Against this I draw Mountains of Mirkwood for a total of 3 threat. Of the 4 progress I make, the first progress realeases Legolas with 1 wound on him and adds the Nazgul of Dol Goldur to the staging area.


 


In the travel phase I travel to Mountains of Mirkwood and draw Under the Shadow, which has no effect.


 


In the encounter phase I risk engaging the Nazgul of Dol Goldur, who attacks Beregond, gaining a wound from Beregond's spear. Luckily there is no shadow effect and the Nazgul does no damage to Beregond. In return Legolas and the Galadhon Archer do 2 more damage to the Nazgul.


 


In the end of the round I refresh everyone and increase my threat to 38.


 


TURN SIX


 


To start I add a resource to my heroes and draw Rivendell Blade before I spend 1 resource from Legolas to play the Rivendell Blade on him then spend 2 resources from Beregond and 3 from Eowyn to play Core Gandalf, using his ability to kill the Hummerhorns and gain 5 VP.


 


In the quest phase I exhaust Eowyn and Galadriel's Handmaiden for a total of 6 willpower. Against that I draw Necromancer's Pass for 2 threat. Of the 4 progress I make, 3 explores Mountains of Mirkwood, allowing me to take another Galadhon Archer into my hand before the last progress goes on stage 2B.


 


During the travel phase I travel to the Necromancer's Pass, discarding Defender of Rammas and Citadel Plate.


 


Skipping the encounter phase I proceed to combat where the Nazgul attacks Beregond again and takes another point of damage from Beregond's Spear. Luckily there is no shadow effect and Beregond takes no damage. In return Legolas, Galadhon Archer, Guthlaf and Gandalf attack for a total of 10 damage which (with Legolas's Rivendell Blade) is more than enough to kill the Nazgul of Dol Goldur.


 


Buoyed up by killing the Nazgul, I increase my threat to 39 and discard Gandalf.


 


TURN SEVEN


 


After adding resources I draw Elven Mail before I spend a resource from Legolas and Beregond to play Galadhon Archer.


 


In the quest phase I commit Eowyn, Galadriel's Handmaiden and Guthlaf for a total of 7 willpower. The staging draw is Caught In A Web, which I attach to Legolas for a total of 0 threat. The first 2 progress explores Necromancer's Pass and the other 5 goes onto stage 2B.


 


At the end of the turn I refresh and increase my threat to 40.


 


TURN EIGHT


 


As usual I add resources then draw Defender of Rammas before I spend 1 resource from Legolas and Beregond and 2 resources from Eowyn to play Boromir.


 


In the quest phase I commit Eowyn, Galadriel's Handmaiden and Guthlaf for a total of 7 willpower. The staging draw is Under the Shadow for a total threat of 1. Of the 6 progress made, 5 explores Stage 2B and I increase my threat to 44 to take the other 2 objectives and attach them to Legolas and Beregond before moving on to stage 3B.


 


At the end of the turn I refresh and discard the three objectives before increasing my threat to 45. This is troubling as it means that I am going to have to race through stage 3B.


 


TURN NINE


 


At the start of the turn I add resources and draw Defender of Rammas before proceeding tot he quest phase where I commit Legolas, Eowyn, Galadriel's Handmaiden, Guthlaf and Boromir for a total of 9 willpower. In order to win the quest I need to draw a card with less than 4 threat. I draw Caught in a Web, which attaches to Eowyn just as I manage to win the quest (presumably by Beregond and his allies dragging Eowyn and Legolas out of Dol Goldur, webbing and all).


 


I suspect I hit very lucky with this game. The hero combo is showing it's quality more and more as the quests get steadily more complicated and I've never had a deck complete EfDG on the first time. The score was:


 


Turns (9): 90


Threat: 45.


Damage: 1


VP: 5


Total: 131

I just beat my head against Dul Goldur for a while yesterday evening - wanted to win with my Outlands deck, but to no avail  :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] glad to see it's actually beatable!  :rolleyes: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_rolleyes.gif]

Like I said, I hit lucky with the encounter deck. The nasty shadow cards invariably turned up as staging draws and vice versa. I've never managed to beat it first time with a deck before so I guess it was luck.

GAME 158 – THE HUNT FOR GOLLUM

 

After realising that the Beregond/Eowyn/Legolas combo has been used a whole lot of times since it is a powerhouse combo I decided to try a different approach.

 

I decided to go with a Scout based deck with Haldir of Lorien and Idraen as well as Bilbo Baggins for card draw. This gives me a total threat of 29.

 

My starting hand is Arwen Undomiel, Daughter of the Nimrodel x2, Galadriel's Handmaiden, Gandalf (Core) and Henamarth Riversong. Since it's got Henamarth Riversong in it I'll keep it.

 

The quest's set-up is relatively easy, I draw the top card from the encounter deck, Banks of the Anduin.

 

TURN ONE

 

At the start of the turn I add a resource to all my heroes and draw A Test Of Will and Gandalf (Core) before I spend 1 resource from Bilbo to pay for Henamarth Riversong. I then exhaust Henamarth to look at the top card of the encounter deck. It is a Signs of Gollum.

 

In the quest phase I commit Bilbo, Haldir and Idraen for a total of 5 willpower. Against that I draw, oddly enough, Signs of Gollum which is guarded by River Ninglor for a total of 3 threat. The 2 progress I make is added to stage 1B.

 

In the travel phase I travel to River Ninglor then skip the encounter and combat phases. At the end of the turn I refresh my cards and increase my threat to 30 before River Ninglor removes a progress from stage 1B.

 

TURN TWO

 

To start off I add resources and draw Self-Preservation and Warden of Healing. I then spend 1 resource each from Bilbo and Haldir to pay for Warden of Healing and 2 resources from Idraen to pay for Arwen Undomiel. I then exhaust Henamarth Riversong to look at the top of the encounter deck, Evil Storm.

 

Knowing what the next card is I commit Bilbo, Haldir, Idraen, the Warden of Healing and Arwen for a total of 8 willpower. The staging draw is Evil Storm, which has no effect and I make 8 progress, 4 of which explore River Ninglor (readying Idraen and adding the Signs of Gollum to Bilbo) and the other 4 go on stage 1B. Now that I read the full stage 1B I remember to look at the top 3 cards in the encounter deck and place Evil Storm into the staging area which, again, does nothing at all.

 

In the travel phase I travel to the Banks of the Anduin.

 

Skipping the encounter and combat phases I refresh all my cards and increase my threat to 31.

 

TURN THREE

 

As usual I add a resource to all my heroes and draw Cloak of Lorien and Song of Wisdom. I then spend 1 resource from Haldir to play Cloak of Lorien on him and spend 1 resource from Bilbo to play Song of Wisdom on Idraen. I then exhaust Henamarth Riversong to look at the top card of the encounter deck, River Ninglor.

 

Moving on to the quest phase, I once again commit Bilbo, Haldir, Idraen, the Warden of Healing and Arwen for a total of 8 willpower. The draw, unsurprisingly is River Ninglor for a total of 2 threat, meaning another 6 progress is made, 3 of which explores Banks of the Anduin and sends it to the top of the encounter deck as well as readying Idraen. The last 3 progress completes stage 1B and I proceed to stage 2B.

 

In the travel phase I travel to River Ninglor before skipping the encounter and combat phases before refreshing all my cards and increasing my threat to 32.

 

TURN FOUR

 

As usual the turn starts with me adding a resource to all my heroes and drawing Miner of the Iron Hills and Wingfoot. I then spend 1 resource from Haldir to play Wingfoot on Haldir as well as spending 2 resources from Idraen to play Galadriel's Handmaiden (reducing my threat to 31) before spending 2 resources from Bilbo and 1 resource from Haldir to pay for Daughter of the Nimrodel.

 

Proceeding to the quest phase I have to look at the top 2 cards of the encounter deck and put 1 into the staging area, I select the Banks of the Anduin. I then commit Haldir, Idraen, Warden of Healing, Arwen, Galadriel's Handmaiden and Daughter of the Nimrodel for a total of 11 willpower before choosing “Location”. The staging draw is Treacherous Fog, which adds 1 to the threat of Banks of the Anduin for a total of 2 threat. A whopping 9 progress is made, 4 explores River Ninglor and readies Idraen before the other 5 go onto stage 2B.

 

In the travel phase I travel to Banks of the Anduin before skipping the encounter and combat phases. I then refresh all my cards and increase my threat to 32.

 

TURN FIVE

 

At the start of the turn I add resources and draw two Ethir Swordsmen. Handy although I can't pay for them this turn.

 

Skipping the planning stage I proceed to the quest phase where, after putting Evil Storm into play and having a lower threat than the minimum threat to trigger it, discard the card. I then exhaust Henamarth Riversong to look at the top card of the encounter deck. It is pursued by Shadow so I will have to commit everyone to the quest to lower the threat increase. In order to do so I commit Bilbo, Haldir (naming Treachery for Wingfoot), Idraen, Warden of Healing, Arwen, Galadriel's Handmaiden and Daughter of Nimrodel for a total of 11 willpower. The staging draw is Pursued By Shadows. Haldir refreshes thanks to Wingfoot and Henamarth Riversong and I am forced to raise my threat to 33. The threat total is 0 so 11 progress is made. The first 3 progress explores Banks of the Anduin and return it to the top of the encounter deck before the next 8 progress explores Stage 2B and I move on to stage 3.

 

Thankfully I have a clue card attached to Bilbo so gameplay proceeds with me again skipping the encounter and combat phases and refreshing my cards before I increase my threat to 34. I then exhaust Henamarth Riversong to look at the top card of the encounter deck, it is Banks of the Anduin which means that I can, in theory win this in the next turn.

 

TURN SIX

 

To start the turn I add a resource to all my heroes before drawing Daeron's Runes and Galadhrim Minstrel. I then play Daeron's Runes, draw Erebor Hammersmith and Unexpected Courage and discard one of my Gandalf's. I then spend 2 resources each from Bilbo and Haldir and 1 resource from Idraen to play Core set Gandalf into play. I then use his ability to lower my threat to 29.

 

Proceeding to the quest phase I commit Bilbo, Haldir (guessing Location for Wingfoot), Idraen, Warden of Healing, Arwen, Galadriel's Handmaiden, Daughter of the Nimrodel and Gandalf for a grand total of 16 willpower. In response, the staging draw is Banks of the Anduin for a total of 1 threat. In a case of ridiculous amounts of overkill I make 15 progress, 7 more than is needed to complete stage 3B and win the quest.

 

In conclusion this deck worked remarkably well. I hit lucky by not having a fight in the whole game (I'm guessing there may have been something deeply wrong with the shuffle but I was filtering out any enemies in the first two stages using the quest effects and it seemed to work. One thing I noticed is that I can potentially have all my characters readying at one point or another in the round. The Henamarth Riversong – Wingfoot combo is nasty.

 

In the end, the total score was:

Turns (6): 60

Threat: 29

Damage: 0

VP: 0

Total: 89

GAME 159 – CONFLICT AT THE CARROCK

 

For this game I am going to try a deck I've never played before, a all-Gondor deck. The heroes will be Boromir (Leadership), Eleanor and Mablung for a total of 28 threat. My starting hand is A Test Of Will, Blood of Numenor, Envoy of Pelargir, Pelargir Ship Captain, Spear of the Citadel and Visionary Leadership.

 

Since I didn't get certain cards I mulligan, drawing Blood of Numenor, Envoy of Pelargir, Feint, Gandalf (Core), Gondorian Fire and Squire of the Citadel.

 

The set-up for the quest adds the Carrock to the staging area and I am ready to begin.

 

TURN ONE

 

As usual I start with adding a resource to all my heroes before I draw Steward of Gondor, I really couldn't ask for a better first turn draw.

 

In the planning stage I spend 1 resource each from Eleanor and Mablung to play Envoy of Pelargir, who adds a resource to Boromir. I then spend 2 resources from Boromir to play Steward of Gondor before exhausting it to add 2 resources to Boromir and remove 1 resource from Boromir to play Squire of the Citadel. I then play Blood of Numenor and Gondorian Fire on Boromir.

 

Proceeding to the quest phase I commit Mablung (for 2), Envoy of Pelargir (for 2) and Squire of the Citadel (for 1) for a total of 5 willpower.

 

Against that I draw Bee Pastures, which makes a total of 3 threat. 2 progress goes onto Stage 1B.

 

In the travel phase I travel to Bee Pastures, which allows me to search the encounter deck for Grimbeorn the Old.and place him into the staging area.

 

Skipping the encounter and combat phases I refresh all my cards and increase my threat to 29.

 

TURN TWO

 

I add a resource to all my heroes and draw Herald from Amorien. I then exhaust Steward of Gondor to add 2 resources to Boromir.

 

In the planning phase I spend 1 resource from Boromir to put it on Grmbeorn the Old. I then spend 2 resources from Boromir to play Herald of Amorien.

 

In the quest phase I exhaust Mablung (for 2), Envoy of Pelargir (for 2), Squire of the Citadel (for 1) and Herald of Amorien (for 2) for a total of 7 willpower.

 

Against that I draw Misty Mountain Goblins who make for a total of 4 threat. 3 progress is made, 2 of which explores Bee Pastures and 1 goes onto stage 1B.

 

Skipping the travel phase the Misty Mountains Goblins engage me which adds 1 resouce to Mablung.

 

In the combat phase I defend with Eleanor who, after a useless shadow card, takes no damage although I lose a progress from stage 1B, which at this point isn't necessarily a bad thing, Boromir attacks for 3, doing 2 damage to the Goblins.

 

At the end of the turn I refresh all my cards before increasing my threat to 30 and removing a resource from Boromir to add it to Grimbeorn the Old.

 

TURN THREE

 

After adding a resource to my heroes I exhaust Steward of Gondor to add 2 resources to Boromir and draw Errand-Rider. I then spend 1 resource from Boromir to play Errand-Rider, then exhaust it to move a resource from Mablung to Boromir and transfer a resource from Boromir to Grimbeorn the Old.

 

In the quest phase I commit Envoy of Pelargir (for 2), Squire of the Citadel (for 1) and Herald of Amorien (for 2) for a total 5 willpower.

 

Against this I draw Goblin Sniper for a total of 4 threat. 1 progress goes onto stage 1B.

 

Skipping the travel phase I risk engaging the Goblin Sniper, which adds a resource to Mablung.

 

In the combat phase the Misty Mountains Goblins attack Eleanor, who takes no damage although again I lose 1 progress from stage 1B.

 

The Goblin Sniper attacks Mablung, who again takes no damage. In response Boromir attacks the Goblin Sniper and kills him.

 

At the end of the round I refresh my cards before increasing my threat to 31 and transferring a resource from Boromir to Grimbeorn the Old.

 

TURN FOUR

 

At the start of the turn I add a resource to all my heroes and draw another Feint. I then exhaust Steward of Gondor to add 2 resources to Boromir before transferring another resource from Boromir to Grimbeorn the Old.

 

In the planning phase I remove 2 resources from Eleanor and 3 from Mablung to pay for Gandalf (Core). I then use his ability to drop my threat to 26.


During the quest phase I commit Envoy of Pelargir (for 2), Squire of the Citadel (for 1) and Herald of Amorien (for 2) for a total 5 willpower.

 

Against this I draw Muck Adder for a total of 3 threat. 2 progress is made against stage 1B before Boromir then transfers a resource to Grimbeorn the Old.

 

Skipping the travel phase the Muck Adder engages me (as usual adding a resource to Mablung).

 

In the combat phase the Muck Adder attack Gandalf doing no damage and the Misty Mountain Goblins attack Mablung, removing 1 progress from Stage 1B and doing no damage. In response Boromir and Eleanor attack for 4, killing the Muck Adder. Boromir then transfers a resource to Grimbeorn the Old.

 

At the end of the turn I refresh all my cards and increase my threat to 27 before Boromir transfers a resource to Grimbeorn the Old and he becomes a ally. Gandalf then is discarded.

 

TURN FIVE

 

To begin the turn I add a resource to all my heroes before drawing Defender of Rammas. I then exhaust Steward of Gondor to add 2 resources to Boromir before spending 2 resources from Mablung to play Defender of Rammas.

 

In the quest phase I commit Envoy of Pelargir (for 2), Squire of the Citadel (for 1), Herald of Amorien (for 2) and Errand-Rider (for 1) for a total of 6 willpower. The staging draw is Banks of the Anduin for a total of 3 threat. 3 progress goes onto stage 1B before I travel to Banks of the Anduin.

 

Skipping the encounter phase the Misty Mountain Goblins attack Defender of Rammas (removing a progress from Stage 1B). I get lucky as the shadow card is a Hill Troll and has no effect. The Goblins do no damage and Boromir finally kills them.

 

At the end of the turn I refresh everything and increase my threat to 28.

 

TURN SIX

 

To start the turn I add a resource to all my heroes and draw another Herald of Amorien. I then exhaust Steward of Gondor to add 2 resources to Boromir. I then spend 2 resources from Boromir to play Herald of Amorien.

 

In the quest phase I commit Envoy of Pelargir (for 2), Squire of the Citadel (for 1), Herald of Amorien (for 2), another Herald of Amorien (for 2) and Errand-Rider (for 1) for a total of 8 willpower.

 

Against this I draw Roasted Slowly, which is negated by Eleanor and dicarded. The replacement is another Muck-Adder. The total threat is 3, meaning that 5 progress is made. The first 3 progress explores Banks of the Anduin and sends it to the top of the encounter deck. The other 2 finally completes stage 1B.

 

At this point the Carrock becomes the active location and I proceed to stage 2B. Louis, Morris, Rupert and Stuart come into play, thankfully with 34 threat I have a round or two to whittle down their numbers.

 

Speaking of which, after skipping the travel phase I am forced to engage the Muck-Adder (which adds another resource to Mablung) and optionally engage Stuart.

 

In the combat phase the Muck-Adder attacks the Defender of Rammas and does no damage. Stuart then attacks Grimbeorn the Old and does 1 damage to him. In return, Boromir pays 1 resource to activate Gondorian Fire and add 4 to his attack. Boromir, Mablung and Grimbeorn then attack for 13, killing Stuart.

 

At the end of the turn I refresh my cards and increase my threat to 29.

 

TURN SEVEN

 

At the start of the turn I add a resource to all my heroes before drawing A Test Of Will. I then exhaust Steward of Gondor to add 2 resources to Boromir.

 

In the quest phase I commit Envoy of Pelargir (for 2), Squire of the Citadel (for 1), Herald of Amorien (for 2), another Herald of Amorien (for 2) and Errand-Rider (for 1) for a total of 8 willpower. Against that I draw Oak Wood Grove, which means that the threat total is also 8. No progress is made.

 

After skipping the travel phase I optionally engage Morris (and add a resource to Mablung). Morris's attack on Grimbeorn is Feinted at the cost of 1 resource from Mablung and the Muck-Adder's attack on Defender of Rammas does no damage. In response, Borormir removes a resource to trigger Gondorian Fire before Boromir and Grimbeorn the Old attack for 13, killing Morris.

 

At the end of the round I refresh my cards and increase my threat to 30.

 

TURN EIGHT

 

At the start of the turn I add a resource to all my heroes before drawing Gandalf (Core). I then exhaust Steward of Gondor to add 2 resources to Boromir. Before spending 3 resources from Mablung and 2 for Eleanor to play Gandalf, who then does 4 damage to the Muck-Adder, killing it.

 

In the quest phase I commit Envoy of Pelargir (for 2), Squire of the Citadel (for 1), Herald of Amorien (for 2), another Herald of Amorien (for 2), Gandalf (for 4) and Errand-Rider (for 1) for a total of 12 willpower.

 

Countering that, I draw Bee Pastures for a total of 7 threat. 5 progress is made and goes onto The Carrock.

 

Once again skipping the travel phase I optionally engage Rupert whose attack on Grimbeorn is Feinted at the cost of 1 resource from Mablung. Boromir Borormir removes a resource to trigger Gondorian Fire before Boromir and Grimbeorn the Old attack for 15, more than killing Rupert.

 

At the end of the turn I refresh all my cards before raising my threat to 31 and discarding Gandalf.

 

TURN NINE

 

At the start of the turn I add a attachment to all my heroes before drawing another Herald of Amorien. I then exhaust Steward of Gondor to add 2 resources to Boromir. I then spend 2 resources from Boromir to play the last Herald of Amorien.

 

In the quest phase I commit Envoy of Pelargir (for 2), Squire of the Citadel (for 1), Herald of Amorien (for 2), another Herald of Amorien (for 2) and another Herald of Amorien (for 2) for a total of 9 wilpower.

 

In response I draw Sacked! Which I negate by exhausting Eleanor. The replacement is Despair which has no effect. The total threat is 5, meaning that 4 progress is made. The first explores the Carrock and the next one completes stage 2B. All I have to do is kill Louis to complete the quest.

 

After skipping travel I optionally engage Louis who attacks Grimbeorn the Old for 4, doing no damage. In response Boromir spends a resource to trigger Gondorian Fire, which gives him a unholy 11 attack and, alongside Grimbeorn the Old does 15 damage to Louis, thoroughly killing him and winning the quest.

 

In conclusion, this deck is ridiculous once I get Steward of Gondor under Boromir his stats can be boosted to a ridiculous amount by Gondorian Fire and Blood of Numenor. Also my questing was boosted greatly by Boromir's ability (the main reason why I didn't go Eleanor/Imrahil/Tactics Boromir). Mablung was generating a lot of resources but I drew relatively few Tactics cards to play them on and Eleanor's suffered from the same problem but her ability was handy on the few occasions I needed to use it (although there are some scenarios where it will be so useful). All in all, I'm starting to wonder why I never built a Gondor deck before.

GAMES 160-162 - A JOURNEY TO RHOSGOBEL

 

These three tries confirmed why I've tended to avoid all-Gondor decks over the years. I either ran out of threat or ran out of wounds on Wilyador and by the time I had finished the third game (having switched out Boromir for Faramir) I was thoroughly sick of the whole all-Gondor idea.

 

I'm going to try something else next time.

## 197 [silverthorn on November 30, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1351840)

GAME 163 – A JOURNEY TO RHOSGOBEL

 

Since I decided that the whole All-Gondor deck idea was dumb I switched out for a Glorfindel (Spirit), Haldir of Lorien and Idraen deck  my starting hand was Asfaloth, Cloak of Lorien, Galadhrim Minstrel, Light Of Valinor, Power of Orthanc and Unexpected Courage. All in all, I couldn't ask for a much better first hand.

 

TURN ONE: THREAT: 25 WILYADOR WOUNDS: 2

 

To begin the game I added a resource to all my heroes and drew Northern Tracker. Following that I spent one resource from Glorfindel to play Light of Valinor on him.

 

In the quest phase I committed Glorfindel (for 3), idraen (for 2) and Wilyador (for 1) for 6 willpower. I then drew Necromancer's Pass for a total of 3 threat, adding 3 progress to stage 1B,

 

In the travel phase I risk travelling to Necromancer's Pass, discarding Cloak of Lorien and Power of Orthanc.

 

After skipping the encounter and combat phases I proceeded to refresh all my cards and increase my threat before adding wounds to Wilyador.

 

TURN TWO: THREAT: 26, WILYADOR WOUNDS: 4.

 

To start the turn I added a resource to my heroes before drawing  I then spent 2 resources from Haldir to play Asfaloth on Glorfindel before spending 1 resource each from Glorfindel and Idraen to play Unexpected Courage on Haldir.

 

In the quest phase I committed Glorfindel (for 3), Haldir (for 2, then refreshed him with Unexpected Courage),, Idraen (for 2) and Wilyador (for 1) for a total of 8 willpower. I then exhausted Asfaloth to add 2 progress to Necromancer's Pass, exploring it and readying Idraen. 

 

The draw was Mirkwood Flock for a total of 2 threat. 6 progress was placed on stage 1B, completing it.

 

In the travel phase I travelled to Rhosgobel.

 

After deciding not to engage the Mirkwood Flock I skipped the combat phase before increasing my threat, refreshing everything and adding wounds to Wilyador.

 

TURN THREE: THREAT 27, WILYADOR WOUNDS: 6.

 

As usual I started the turn by adding a resource to my heroes before drawing Song of Wisdom. I then spent 1 resouce to play Song of Wisdom on Idraen before spending 1 resource each from Idraen and Haldir to play Galadhrim Minstrel. She lets me look at the top 5 cards in my deck for a event. The only one I draw is Lore of Imladris, a mighty handy event in the quest.

 

In the quest phase I commit Glorfindel (for 3), Haldir (for 2, refreshing with Unexpected Courage), Idraen (for 2), Wilyador (for 1) and Galadhrim Minstrel (for 1) for a total of 9 willpower.

 

I then drew Forest Glade for a total of 3 threat. 6 progress goes onto Rhosgobel, exploring it and readying Idraen as well as putting Rhosgobel into my victory pile. The last 2 progress goes onto stage 2B.

 

In the travel phase I travel to Forest Glade.

 

Since I didn't optionally engage the Mirkwood Flock I proceed to end the turn by refreshing everything, adding threat and taking wounds on Wilyador.

 

TURN FOUR: THREAT: 28, WILYADOR WOUNDS: 8

 

To start this round I added resources to my heroes before drawing Elrond's Counsel. I then spent 1 resource each from Haldir and Idraen to play Lore of Imladris, taking 5 wounds from Wilyador.

 

In the quest phase I committed Glorfindel (for 3), Haldir (for 2, refreshing with Unexpected Courage), Idraen (for 2), Wilyador (for 1) and Galadhrim Minstrel (for 1). I then played Elrond's Counsel on Idraen to add a willpower and drop my threat to 25. I finished with a total 10 willpower.

 

I then drew Great Forest Web for a total of 3 threat. 7 progress was made, 2 explored Forest Glade, refreshing Idraen and searching the encounter deck for a Athelas which was guarded by another Forest Glade. I then exhausted Asfaloth to explore Forest Glade and exhausted Idraen to attach Athelas to her. 5 progress was placed on stage 2B,

 

After exhausting Haldir I travel to Great Forest Web and exhaust Glorfindel to attach a Athelad to him before skipping the encounter and combat phases.

 

I then end the turn by raising my threat and adding wounds to Wilyador.

 

TURN FIVE  THREAT: 26, WILYADOR WOUNDS: 5.

 

To start the turn I added resources to my heroes before drawing A Test Of Will. I then spent 2 resources each from Glorfindel and Idraen to play Northern Tracker. I then exhausted Asfaloth to explore Great Forest Web.

 

In the quest phase I committed Glorfindel (for 3), Haldir (for 2, readied by Unexpected Courage), Idraen (for 2), Wilyador (for 1), Galadhrim Minstrel (for 1) and Northern Tracker (for 1) for a total of 10 willpower.

 

The draw was Caught In A Web, which goes onto Glorfindel for a total threat of 1. 9 progress goes onto stage 2B to more than complete it. 

 

Stage 3 tells me to remove 5 wounds from Wilyador for each Athelas I have, a total of 10 wounds from a Eagle with 5 wounds. I therefore win the quest.

 

In conclusion, this deck seemed to gel well from the get go. It was probably because I got pretty much all the cards I wanted in my opening hand but this quest went by a lot quicker than I can remember it doing before.

 

The final score was:

 

Completed Turns (4): 40

Threat: 26

Dead Heroes: 0

Damage: 0

VP: 4

Total Score: 62

GAME 164 – HILLS OF EMYN MUL


 


For this game I am using the exact same hero line-up as last time; Spirit Glorfindel, Haldir of Lorien and Idraen for a starting threat of 25.


 


My starting hand is Cloak of Lorien, Gandalf (Core), Lore of Imladris, Lorien Guide, Radagast (who I could have sworn I had removed since I played last) and Wingfoot.


 


Since I didn't get a certain elven horse I mulligan and draw Cloak of Lorien, Gandalf (Core) x2, Henamarth Riversong, Ithilien Archer and Power of Orthanc.


 


Quest set-up is adding Amon-Lhaw and Amon-Hen to the staging area.


 


TURN ONE: THREAT: 25. VP: 0.


 


To get the show on the road I addded resources to all my heroes and drew Song of Wisdom.


 


I then spent 1 resource from Haldir to play Henamarth Riversong before Idrain spent 1 resource to play Song of Wisdom on herself. I then exhausted Henamarth Riversong to look at the top card of the encounter deck, namely Rockslide.


 


In the quest phase I commit Glorfindel for 3 (adding 1 to my threat) and Idraen for 2 for a total of 5 willpower. Unsurprisingly the draw is Rockslide which does 2 damage to Glorfindel and Idraen. The threat total is 4 so I make 1 progress on Stage 1A.


 


In the travel phase I travel to Amon Hen and cannot play events.


 


Skipping the encounter and combat phases I refresh everything and increase my threat.


 


TURN TWO: THREAT 27, VP: 0


 


To start the turn I added resources to all my heroes and drew Galadhrim Minstrel. I then exhausted Henamarth Riversog to look at the top card of the encounter deck, Rauros Falls.


 


Skipping the planning phase I proceeded to the quest phase where I committed Glorfindel for 3 (increasing my threat), Haldir for 2 and Idraen for 2 for a total of 7 willpower.


 


The draw is Rauros Falls for a total of 4 threat. 3 progress goes onto Amon Hen.


 


Skipping the encounter and combat phases I proceed to end the turn by refreshing and increasing my threat.


 


TURN THREE: THREAT: 29. VP: 0.


 


As usual I started by adding a resource to my heroes and drew another Song of Wisdom. I then spent 1 resource from Haldir to play Song of Wisdom on Glorfindel. I then spent 2 resources from Glorfindel to play Galadhrim Minstrel who allows me to search the top 5 cards of my deck for a event, Elrond's Counsel. I then spent 3 resources from Idraen to play Ithilien Archer.


 


After doing a whole lot of planning I exhausted Henamarth Riversong to look at the top card of the encounter deck, namely Necromancer's Pass.


 


Knowing what to expect I commit Glorfindel for 3 (increasing my threat), Haldir for 2, Idraen for 2. Galadhrim Minstrel for 2 and Ithilien Archer for 1 for a total of 10 willpower.


 


The draw is Necromancer's Pass for a total of 7 threat, meaning that the 3 progress explores Amon Hen and sends it to the victory display while readying Idraen.


 


Having made some progress I travelled to Amon-Lhaw before skipping the rest of the round and refreshing before increasing my threat.


 


TURN FOUR: THREAT: 31. VP: 5.


 


To start this turn I added resources to all my heroes before drawing Asfaloth, cue my happy face as I can finally kick this quest into high gear.


 


In the planning stage I spent 2 resources from Haldir to play Asfaloth on Glorfindel. Although I can't use it right now it's going to be able to cut the amount of turns I'll need to finish this quest. I then exhaust Henamarth Riversong to look at the top encounter card, namely The Necromancer's Reach. This is going to take some planning.


 


In the quest phase I committed Glorfindel for 3 (adding to my threat) and played Elrond's Counsel to add 1 to Glorfindel's willpower while cutting my threat. The willpower total was 4.


 


The encounter draw was The Necromancer's Reach, which did another point of damage on Glorfindel. The threat total is 5 so I raise my threat again.


 


To end the turn I refresh all my cards before raising my threat again.


 


TURN FIVE: THREAT: 34, VP: 5.


 


To start the turn I added resources to all my heroes before drawing Arwen Undomiel. I then spend 1 resource each from Glorfindel and Idraen to play Arwen Undomiel. I then exhaust Henamarth Riversong to see that the top card in the encounter deck is The East Wall Of Rohan.


 


Knowing that I can safely go all in in the quest phase I committed Glorfindel for 3 (adding to my threat), Haldir for 2 Idraen for 2, Galadhrim Minstrel for 2, Ithilien Archer for 1 and Arwen Undomiel for 2 for a total of 12 willpower.


 


The draw is the East Wall Of Rohan for a total of 9 threat. 3 progress goes on Amon-Lhaw.


 


To end the turn I refresh all my cards before raising my threat again.


 


TURN SIX: THREAT: 36. VP: 5.


 


To start the turn I added resources before drawing Self-Preservation. I then spend all the resources on my heroes to play Gandalf who immediately cuts my threat by 5. I then exhaust Henamarth Riversong to see that the top encounter card is The Highlands.


 


Proceeding to questing I committed Glorfindel for 3 (adding to my threat), Haldir for 2 Idraen for 2, Galadhrim Minstrel for 2, Ithilien Archer for 1, Arwen Undomiel for 2 and Gandalf for 4 for a total of 16 willpower.


 


The encounter draw is The Hightlands for a total of 10 threat. 6 progress is made, which is more than enough to explore Amon-Lhaw, refresh Idraen and send Amon-Lhaw to the victory display.


 


Since I now can use attachments Asfaloth exhausts to explore the East Wall Of Rohan and add it to the vicory display.


 


I then travel to the Rauros Falls.


 


To end the turn I refresh all my cards before raising my threat again and discarding Gandalf.


 


TURN SEVEN; THREAT: 33, VP: 13.


 


At the start of the turn I added resources before drawing Radagast. I then spend 1 resource from all my heroes to play Self-Preservation on Glorfindel, who then exhausts it to heal him completely. I then exhaust Henamarth Riversong to see that the top card of the deck is The North Star.


 


Forewarned, I am forced to commit Glorfindel (raising my threat) for 3, Haldir for 2, Idraen for 2, Galadhrim Minstrel for 1, Ithilien Archer for 1 and Arwen for 2 for a total willpower of 11. I then exhausted Asfaloth to explore Necromancer's Pass and refresh Idraen.


 


The draw is the North Stair and the total threat is 4. I make 7 progress and explore Rauros Falls.


 


I then travelled to The North Stair.


 


To end the turn I refresh all my cards before raising my threat again.


 


TURN EIGHT: THREAT: 35. VP: 16.


 


To start the turn I added a resource to my heroes and drew Ithilien Archer. I then spent 1 resource from each hero to play another Ithilien Archer before exhausting Henamarth Riversong to see that Slick Footing is the top card in the deck and exhaust Asfaloth to explore the Highlands.


 


In the quest phase I committed Glorfindel (raising my threat) for 3, Haldir for 2, Idraen for 2, Galadhrim Minstrel for 1, two Ithilien Archers for 2 and Arwen for 2 for a total of 12 willpower.


 


The encounter draw is Slick Footing for no effect. The 12 progress explores the North Stair which means that I have made 20 victory points and win the quest.


 


 


This quest is very different from the last one. I really needed to get Asfaloth at the start of the game but I managed to get through due to the ridiculous amount of questers in this deck.

GAME 165 – THE DEAD MARSHES

 

Once again, I used my Glorfindel (Spirit), Haldir of Lorien & Idraen combo for a starting threat of 25. My opening hand was Daughter of the Nimrode x2l, Elrond's Counsel, Gandalf (Core) x2 and Henamarth Riversong.

 

Since I didn't get Light of Valinor I mulligan'd, drawing Erebor Hammersmith, Light of Valinor, Lorien Guide, Northern Tracker, Self-Preservation and Song of Wisdom.

 

Set-up consists of adding Gollum to the staging area and drawing Wolf Rider to the staging area.

 

[Turn One – Threat: 25. Stage 1A progress remaining: 12]

 

To start the game I added a resource to all my heroes before drawing Cloak of Lorien to my hand.

 

I then spent 1 resource from Glorfindel to play Light of Valinor.

 

In the quest phase I committed Glorfindel for 3 willpower before drawing Nightfall and making a 2 card escape test. I exhaust Glorfindel for 3 willpower before drawing another Nightfall and the Heart of the Marshes for a total of 3 escape so I fail the escape test.

 

As a result I added 1 resource to Gollum and added 2 to my threat. On the other had I made 2 progress towards stage 1B.

 

After skipping the travel phase I engaged the Wolf Rider, who attacked Idraen for 2, doing no damage.

 

At the end of the turn I exhausted Haldir for 2 willpower before making an escape test. The draw was The Brown Lands, meaning that I passed the test. I then ended the the turn by refreshing my cards and raising my threat.

 

[Turn Two – Threat: 28. Stage 1A progress remaining: 10]

 

At the beginning of the turn I added a resource to my heroes before drawing A Test Of Will. I then spent 2 resources from Idraen and 1 resource from Glorfindel to play Lorien Guide and 2 resources from Haldir to play Erebor Hammersmith.

 

In the quest phase I again committed Glorfindel for 3 willpower before drawing Despair, which removed the 2 progress from stage 1A before adding another 3 for succesfully questing.

 

After skipping the travel and encounter phases the Wolf Rider attacked Idraen, doing 1 damage to her due to a Wargs shadow card. In return, Haldir attacked for 2, killing the Wolf Rider.

 

At the end of the turn I exhaust Glorfindel for 3 willpower before making an escape test and drawing Hill Troll, meaning that I passed the escape test. I then refreshed my cards before raising my threat.

 

[Turn Three – Threat: 29. Stage 1A progress remaining: 9]

 

To start the turn I added a resource to my heroes before drawing Elrond's Counsel.

 

Skipping planning I proceeded to the quest phase where I committed Glorfindel (for 3), the Lorien Guide (for 1) and the Erebor Hammersmith (for 1) for a total of 5 willpower.

 

The draw was Goblin Sniper for a total of 2 threat. Another 3 progress is added to stage 1B.

 

Skipping the travel phase I engage the Goblin Sniper and he attacks Idraen for 2 and doing no damage. Haldir then attack him for 2, killing him.

 

At the end of the turn I exhaust Glorfindel for 3 willpower and drawing Marsh-Adder for nothing meaning that I win the escape test. I then refreshed my cards and increased my threat.

 

[Turn Four – Threat: 30. Stage 1A progress remaining: 6]

 

As usual I started the round by adding a resource to my heroes before drawing Lorien Guide.

 

In the planning phase I spent 2 resources each from Glorfindel and Idraen to play Northern Tracker.

 

In the quest phase I committed Glorfindel (for 3), Lorien Guide (for 1), Erebor Hammersmith (for 1) and Northern Guide (for 1) for a total of 6 willpower.

 

The draw was Fens and Mires for a total of 2 willpower. 4 progress is placed on stage 1B.

 

In the travel phase I risk travelling to Fens and Mires, adding a resource to Gollum.

 

After skipping encounter and combat I committed Glorfindel for 3 before drawing Great Marsh Worm, which means that I won the escape test before refreshing my cards and increasing my threat.

 

[Turn Five – Threat: 31. Stage 1A progress remaining: 2]

 

To start with I added a resource to my heroes and drew Lore of Imladris. I then spent 3 resources from Haldir to play Self-Preservation on Idraen.

 

In the quest phase I committed Glorfindel for 3, Lorien Guide for 1 (adding a progress to Fens and Mires), Erebor Hammersmith for 1 and Northern Tracker for 1, giving me a total of 6 willpower.

 

The draw was A Wind of Pale Sheen which I exhausted Haldir to only have to add 1 resource to Gollum. I made 6 progress, 1 eplored Fens and Mires, the next 2 completed stage 1B.

 

Skipping the travel, encounter and combat phases I exhausted Glorfindel for a total of 3 willpower before drawing Fens and Marshes and passing the escape test. I then exhausted Self-Preservation to heal the wound on Idraen before I refreshed my cards and raised my threat.

 

[Turn Six – Threat: 32. Stage 2B progress remaining: 3]

 

To start the turn I added resources to my heroes before drawing Cloak of Lorien. Knowing that this might be the last turn of the game I spent all the resources on Glorfindel and Idraen to play another Lorien Guide.

 

Proceeding to the quest phase I committed Glorfindel for 3, 2 Lorien Guides for 2, Erebor Hammersmith for 1 and Northern Tracker for a total of 7 willpower.

 

The draw was Eastern Crows for 1 threat. 6 progress was made and added to stage 2B, completing it and meaning that I have to survive a three-card escape test. I commit Glorfindel for 3, Haldir for 2 and Idraen for 2 before playing Elrond's Counsel to add another willpower and reduce my threat.

 

The three cards drawn were Evil Storm for 0, The East Bight for 0 and The Light Of The Dead for 5 giving it a total of 5. With the escape test passed I complete the quest.

 

 

 

Glorfindel really shows his quality (so to speak) in the quest. The ability to quest then solve escape tests is probably the main reason why I won this quest (added to the lack of enemies coming out of the encounter deck).

GAME 166 – RETURN TO MIRKWOOD

 

For this game I continued to use Glorfindel (Spirit), Haldir and Idraen as they seem like a succesful combination.

 

My starting hand was A Test Of Will, Daughter of the Nimrodel, Gandalf (Core), Imladris Stargazer, Ithilien Archer and Wingfoot.

 

After considering my options I opted to mulligan, drawing Galadhrim Minstrel, Imladris Stargazer x2, Ithilien Archer, Miner of the Iron Hills and Wingfoot.

 

The set-up for the quest consisted of adding Gollum to my side of the table and drawing Wood Elf Trail.

 

[TURN ONE – 25 THREAT, 0/12 PROGRESS TOWARDS TOWARDS STAGE 1B]

 

To start the game I added a resource to my heroes and drew Arwen Undomiel. I then spent 1 resource from Haldir to play Wingfoot on him and 1 resource each from Glorfindel and Idraen to play Arwen Undomiel.

 

In the quest phase I committed Glorfindel for 3, adding 1 to my threat, Haldir for 2 (calling enemy) and Arwen Undomiel for 2 (adding her defense bonus to Idraen) for a total of 7 willpower.

 

I then drew The East Bight for a total of 2 threat. 5 progress was made towards stage 1B,

 

During the travel phase I travelled to the East Bight before I skipped the encounter and combat phases and refreshed my cards before increasing my threat and ending my turn.

 

[TURN TWO – 30 THREAT, 5/12 PROGRESS TOWARDS TOWARDS STAGE 1B]

 

To begin this turn I added a resource to my heroes before drawing Light Of Valinor. I then proceeded to spend 1 resource from Glorfindel to play Light of Valinor on him.

 

In the quest phase I committed Glorfindel for 3, Haldir for 2 (calling enemy), Idraen for 2  and Arwen Undomiel for 2 (adding her defense bonus to Idraen) for a total of 9 willpower.

 

The draw was Goblin Sniper (readying Haldir) for a total of 3 threat. 6 progress is made, just enough to explore the East Bight (and ready Idraen).

 

In the travel phase I travel to Wood Elf Path before optioally engaging the Goblin Sniper.

 

The Goblin Sniper attacks Idraen, doing no damage before Haldir and Glorfindel attack and kill it.

 

At the end of the turn I refreshed my cards and raised my threat.

 

[TURN THREE – 34 THREAT, 5/12 PROGRESS TOWARDS TOWARDS STAGE 1B]

 

At the start of the turn I added a resource to my heroes and drew Galadhrim Minstrel. I then spent 2 resources from Haldir to pay for Galadhrim Minstrel who search my deck for a event, Elrond's Counsel and 1 resource each from Glorfindel and Idraen to pay for Imladris Stargazer, who I immediately exhausted to look at and rearrange the top 5 cards of my deck.

 

In the quest phase I committed Glorfindel for 3, Haldir for 2 (calling Enemy), Idraen for 2, Arwen Undomiel for 2 (giving Idraen +1 defence) and Galadhrim Minstrel for 1. I then played Elrond's Counsel to drop my threat and add another willpower for a total of 11 willpower.

 

The draw was Warg Rider (which readied Haldir) who surged to Dry Watercourse for 3 threat. 8  progress was made, 3 explored Wood Elf Trail (readying Idraen) and 5 was added to stage 1B.

 

In the travel phase I travelled to Dry Watercourse before the Wolf Rider engaged me.

 

In the combat phase the Wolf Rider attacked Idraen, doing no damage before Glorfindel killed it.

 

At the end of the turn I refreshed my cards before increasing my threat.

 

[TURN FOUR – 35 THREAT, 10/12 PROGRESS TOWARDS TOWARDS STAGE 1B]

 

At the start of the turn I added resources to my heroes before drawing Asfaloth. I then exhausted Imladris Statgazer to look at and rearrange the top 5 cards in my deck.

 

In the quest phase I committed Glorfindel for 3, Haldir for 2 (calling Enemy), Idraen for 2, Arwen Undomiel for 2 (giving Idraen +1 defence) and Galadhrim Minstrel for 1 for a total of 10 willpower.

 

The draw was Goblin Sniper for a total of 2 willpower (readying Haldir) meaning that 8 progress was made. 2 explored Dry Watercourse and readied Idraen, the rest finished stage 1B.

 

Skipping travel, I optionally engaged the Goblin Sniper who attacked Idraen, doing no damage before Glorfindel killed it.

 

At the end of the turn I refreshed my cards before increasing my threat.

 

[TURN FIVE – 39 THREAT, 0/3 PROGRESS TOWARDS TOWARDS STAGE 2B]

 

At the start of the turn I added a resource to my heroes and drew Core Set Gandalf. I then spent  2 resources each from Glorfindel and Idraen and 1 resource from Haldir to play Gandalf and immediately used his ability to lower my threat.

 

In the quest phase I committed Glorfindel for 3, Haldir for 2 (calling Enemy), Idraen for 2, Arwen Undomiel for 2 (giving Idraen +1 defence), Gandalf for 4 and Galadhrim Minstrel for 1 for a total of 14 willpower.

 

The draw was Wasted Provisions, which discards the top 10 cards of my deck. The threat total is 0 so 14 progress massively over-kills the 3 threat needed to complete stage 2A. I then exhausted Imladris Stargazer to look at and rearrange the top 5 cards of my deck.

 

Skipping the rest of the turn I refresh my cards before raising my threat and discarding Gandalf.

 

[TURN SIX – 38 THREAT, 0/7 PROGRESS TOWARDS TOWARDS STAGE 3B]

 

After adding resource I drew Unexpected Courage.

 

In the questing phase I committed Glorfindel for 3, Haldir for 2 (calling Enemy), Idraen for 2, Arwen Undomiel for 2 (giving Idraen +1 defence) and Galadhrim Minstrel for 1 for a total of 10 willpower.

 

The draw was Gollum's Bite and I alocate 4 damage to Glorfindel. The total threat is 0 so 10 progress is made and completes stage 3B. I then exhaust Imladris Stargazer to examine then rearrange the top 5 cards of my deck.

 

At the end of the turn I refresh my cards and add to my threat.

 

[TURN SEVEN – 42 THREAT, 0/2 PROGRESS TOWARDS TOWARDS STAGE 4B]

 

At the start of what I hoped would be the last turn I added resources before drawing Henamarth Riversong. I then spent 1 resource from Haldir to play Henamarth Riversong before exhausting her to look at the top card of the encounter deck. It was a Great Forest Web which was good news.

 

 

In the quest phase I committed pretty much everyone and managed 10 willpower before drawing Great Forest Web for 2 threat. I made 8 progress and, since there were no enemies in play, completed the quest and the Shadows of Mirkwood cycle.

GAME 167 – INTO THE PIT


 


In honor of starting the Khazad-Dum expansion I brought in a deck full of Dwarves. My heroes were Bifur, Dain Ironfoot and Nori for a starting threat of 27.


 


My starting hand was:


 


Lore Of Imladris


Legacy of Durin


Erebor Hammersmith


Self-Preservation


Ered Nimrais Prospector


Erebor Record-Keeper


 


Since it didn't have any of the cards I really wanted I decided to mulligan, drawing:


 


Lure of Moria


Ever My Heart Rises


Legacy of Durin


Steward of Gondor


Zigil Miner


Hardy Leadership


 


Set-up for the quest consists of placing East Gate as the starting location and attaching the Cave Torch to Nori before drawing Burning Low, which does nothing.


 


Turn One


 


Resource Phase


I added a resource to my heroes.


I drew Miner of the Iron Hills.


 


Planning Stage


I played Ever My Heart Rises on Bifur.


 


Quest Phase


I committed Bifur (for three) and Nori (for three) for a total of six willpower.


I drew Patrol Leader for a total of three threat.


Three progress was placed onto East Gate.


 


Refresh Phase


I refreshed my cards.


I increased my threat to twenty eight.


 


Turn Two


 


Resource Phase


I added a resource to all my heroes.


I drew Hardy Leadership again.


 


Planning Phase


I spent two resources from Dain Ironfoot to play Steward of Gondor on Dain Ironfoot.


I exhausted Steward of Gondor to add two resources to Dain Ironfoot.


I spent two resources from Dain Ironfoot to play Hardy Leadership on Dain Ironfoot.


I spent one resource from Bifur to play Legacy of Durin on Bifur.


I spent two resources from Nori to play Zigil Miner, reducing my threat to twenty seven and drawing Erebor Hammersmith.


 


Quest Stage


I committed Bifur for three, Nori for three and Zigil Miner for two for a total of eight willpower.


I drew Goblin Tunnels for a total of five threat. Another three progress was placed onto East Gate.


I risk exhausting Cave Torch to add three progress onto Goblin Tunnels. The draw is Branching Paths and is discarded.


 


Refresh Phase


I refresh my cards.


I increase my threat to twenty eight.


 


Turn Three


 


Resource Phase


I added a resource to my heroes.


I drew A Test Of Will.


I exhausted Steward of Gondor to add two resources to Dain Ironfoot.


 


Planning Phase


I spent two resources from Bifur to play Erebor Hammersmith, then reduced my threat to twenty seven and drew Ever My Heart Rises.


I played Ever My Heart Rises on Nori.


 


Quest Phase


I committed Bifur for three, Nori for three, Zigili Miner for two and Erebor Hammersmith for two for a total of ten willpower.


I drew Zigil Mineshaft for 5 threat.


I exhausted Cave Torch to add 3 progress to Zigil Mineshaft. The draw was Stairs of Nain, which is discarded.


I increased my threat to twenty eight to add a progress to Zigil Mineshaft.


I increased my threat to twenty nine to add a progress to Zigil Mineshaft and explore it.


The threat total was five against ten willpower. Five progress is made, one explores East Gate and adds it to the victory display. Four progress is added to stage 1B leaving me with three progress to make.


I added First Hall to the staging area.


 


Travel Phase


I travel to Goblin Tunnels. Since it is a underground location I refresh Bifur and Nori and reduce my threat to twenty seven.


 


Encounter Phase


I opted to not engage the Patrol Leader.


 


Refresh Phase


I refresh my cards.


I increase my threat to twenty eight.


 


Turn Four


 


Resource Phase


I added a resource to my heroes.


I drew Narvi's Belt.


I exhausted Steward of Gondor to add two resources to Dain Ironfoot.


 


Planning Phase


I spent two resources from Dain Ironfoot to play Narvi's Belt on Dain Ironfoot.


I exhausted Narvi's Belt to give Dain Ironfoot the Lore icon.


I spent one resource from Bifur and one from Dain Ironfoot to pay for Miner of the Iron Hills which reduces my threat to twenty seven before I drew Dwalin.


I spent one resource from Nori to play Dwalin, which drops my threat to twenty six before I drew Zigil Miner.


 


Quest Phase


I committed Bifur for three, Nori for three, Zigil Miner for two, Erebor Hammersmith for two, Miner of the Iron Hills for one and Dwalin for two.


In addition to the five in the staging area I drew Goblin Swordsman for one threat.


The willpower is thirteen against six threat. Seven progress is made.


Four progress explores the Goblin Tunnels and three of seven progress goes onto stage 1B.


 


Travel Phase


I raised my threat to twenty nine to travel to First Hall, which due to it being a underground location, readies Bifur and Nori and drops my threat to twenty seven.


 


At this point I should point out that I could not believe how tough this deck is. I'm mid-way through turn four and I'm on the same threat as I started on. I have no idea why Ever My Heart Rises isn't unique. Anyway, rant over. Back to the action..


 


Encounter Phase


I engage the Goblin Swordsman.


 


Combat Phase


The Goblin Swordsman attacks Bifur.


The shadow card is Watchful Eyes, no effect.


The Goblin Swordsman does one damage to Bifur.


Dain Ironfoot and Nori attack for three, killing the Goblin Swordsman.


 


Refresh Phase


I refresh my cards.


I increase my threat to twenty eight.


 


Turn Five


 


Resource Phase


I added a resource to my heroes.


I drew Self-Preservation.


I exhausted Steward of Gondor to add two resources to Dain Ironfoot.


 


Planning Phase


I exhausted Narvi's Belt to give Dain Ironfoot the Spirit icon for this phase.


I spent one icon each from Dain Ironfoot and Nori to play another Zigil Miner. This drops my threat to twenty seven and draws Longbeard Orc Slayer.


I spent four resources from Dain Ironfoot to play the Longbeard Orc Slayer who does one damage to the Patrol Leader as well as lowering my threat to twenty six and drawing Lore of Imladris.


 


Quest Phase


I committed Bifur (for three), Nori (for three), Zigil Miner (for two), Erebor Hammersmith (for two), Dwalin (for two) and Zigil Miner (for two).


In addition to the three already in the staging area I drew Crumbling Ruin and exhaust the Miner of The Iron Hills before drawing Legacy of Durin from my deck. Since it is a cheaper card than the Miner it is safe.


I made fourteen willpower against three threat, making eleven progress. Two explore the First Hall and add it to the victory display and another four complete stage 1B. As soon as I explore the Bridge of Khazad-Dum I can proceed to stage 2.


the Bridge of Khazad-Dum is added to the staging area.


 


Travel Phase


I travel to the Bridge of Khazad-Dum, which due to it being a underground location, readies Bifur and Nori and lowers my threat to twenty four.


 


Encounter Phase


I opt to not engage the Patrol Leader.


 


Refresh Phase


I refresh my cards.


I increased my threat to twenty five.


 


Turn Six


 


Resource Phase


I add a resource to my heroes.


I draw Sneak Attack.


I exhausted Steward of Gondor to add two resources to Dain Ironfoot.


I spend one resource from Dain Ironfoot to add one resource to Bifur.


 


Quest Phase


I committed Bifur for three, Nori for three and the two Zigil Miners for four.


In addition to the three in the staging area I drew Lightless Passage for four.


I make ten willpower to the seven threat, meaning that I make three progress, which is enough to explore Bridge of Khazad-Dum, addi it to the victory display and proceed to stage 2.


 


Stage 2B tells me to add another Patrol Leader to the staging area and states that if there are no enemies in the staging area I proceed directly to stage 3.


 


Travel Phase


I exhaust the Cave Torch to travel to Lightless Passage. This refreshes Bifur and Nori and reduces my threat to twenty three.


 


Encounter Phase


I optionally engage the wounded Patrol Leader.


 


Combat Phase


The wounded Patrol Leader attacks the Miner of the Iron Hills.


The shadow card is Fouled Well, for no effect.


The Patrol Leader does four damage to the Miner of the Iron Hills, killing him.


Bifur, Nori and the Longbeard Orc Slayer attack for seven, killing the Patrol Leader.


 


Refresh Phase


I refresh my cards.


I increase my threat to twenty four.


 


Turn Seven


 


Resource Phase


I add a resource to my heroes.


I draw Zigil Miner.


I exhaust Steward of Gondor to add two more resources to Dain Ironfoot.


 


Planning Phase


I spend two resources from Nori to play Zigil Miner, reducing my threat to twenty three and drawing Miner of the Iron Hills.


I spend one resource from Dain Ironfoot to add it to Bifur.


I spend three resources from Bifur to play Self-Preservation onto Bifur.


I exhaust Self-Preservation to heal the wound on Bifur.


I spend two resources from Bifur to play Miner of the iron Hills. This reduces my threat to twenty two and draws another Self-Preservation.


I exhaust Narvi's Belt to add a lore icon to Dain Ironfoot.


I spend three resources from Dain Ironfoot to play another Self-Preservation on Bifur.


 


Quest Phase


I commit Bifur for three, Nori for three and the three Zigil Miners for six.


In addition to the three threat in play I draw Many Roads which shuffles all locations back into the encounter deck before it surges to Dreadful Gap, which replaces Lightless Passage. The bad thing is that I need to make ten progress to pass it.


After adding Lightless Passage there is a total of seven threat in play to my twelve willpower. Five progress goes onto Dreadful Gap.


 


Encounter Phase


I optionally engage the Patrol Leader.


 


Combat Phase


The Patrol Leader attacks the Miner of the Iron Hills.


The shadow card is Signs of Conflict which increases my threat to twenty four.


The Patrol Leader does four damage to the Miner of the Iron Hills, kiliing it.


The Longbeard Orc Slayer, Erebor Hammersmith and Dwalin attack for 7, the draw is Zigil Mineshaft, which means that the Patrol Leader is killed. This completes stage 2.


 


Refresh Stage


I refresh my cards.


I increase my threat to twenty five.


 


Turn Eight


 


Resource Phase


I draw King Under The Mountain.


 


Quest Phase


I commit Bifur for three, Nori for three, three Zigil Miners for six, Erebor Hammersmith for two, Dwalin for two and Longbeard Orc Slayer for one.


In addition to the four threat in play I draw Stairs of Nain for two.


I make seventeen willpower against six threat meaning that eleven progress is made. Four explores Dreadful Gap and sends it to the victory display before seven progress goes onto stage 3B.


 


Travel phase


I travel to Lightless Passage, refreshing Bifur and Nori and reducing my threat to twenty three.


I exhaust the Cave Torch to add three progress to Lightless Passage and draw Signs of Conflict which is discarded.


 


Refresh Phase


I refresh my cards.


I increase my threat to twenty four.


 


Turn Nine


 


Resource Phase


I draw Gloin.


 


Quest Phase


I commit Bifur for three, Nori for three, three Zigil Miners for six, Erebor Hammersmith for two, Dwalin for two and Longbeard Orc Slayer for one.


In addition to the two threat in the staging area I draw another Stairs of Nain for two threat.


I exhaust Cave Torch to add the final progress to Lightless Passage before drawing Zigil Mineshaft, which is discarded.


My willpower is seventeen against four threat so thirteen progress is made. It is more than enough to explore stage 3B and win the quest.


 


 


This deck is ridiculous. I spent nine turns and ended up with a lower threat than I started off with. The final score was:


 


Completed Turns (8): 80


Threat: 24.


VP: 7


Total Score: 97.

I know. I was just jokingly saying that 200 replies to the thread was close enough to playing 200 games that he might as well call it quits, which is obviously not true. Mostly I just wanted to point out the 200 reply milestone in a silly way.

thanks, it's so freaky that I've got so many replies to this thread. When I started this I was hoping some folks might at least look at the thread. To be on page 11 already is a big plus.


 


GAME 168 – THE SEVENTH LEVEL


 


After having a moment of briliance (nothing to do with watching the start of The Two Towers last night) I decided to try a 'Three Hunters' deck with Aragorn (Leadership), Gimli and Legolas. The up side is that they are tough heroes. The down side is that I wind up with a threat of 32.


 


After a mulligan I drew Bofur, Citadel Plate x2, Feint, Song of Battle and Steward of Gondor.


 


For quest set-up I add Book of Mazarbul to Aragorn before drawing Goblin Spearman.


 


Turn One


 


I added a resource to each hero before drawing Galadhon Archer.


 


In the planning phase I spent one resource from Gimli and Legolas to play Galadhon Archer who does one damage to Gondor Spearman.


 


In the quest phase I committed Aragorn for two and Gimli for two for a total of four willpower before I drew Goblin Spearman for a total of three threat. I make one progress on stage 1B.


 


In the encounter phase I was forced to engage both Goblin Spearman and Gobln Swordsman.


 


In the combat phase the Goblin Spearman attacks Aragorn for two, doing no damage. The Goblin Swordsman then attacked the Galadhon Archer for 3, killing her. Legolas then attacked the Goblin Swordsman for three, killing it and adding two progress to stage 1B.


 


At the end of the turn I refreshed my cards before increasing my threat to 33.


 


Turn Two


 


I added a resource to all my heroes then drew Nalth Guide.


 


In the planning phase I used two resources from Aragorn to buy Steward of Gondor. I then exhausted the Steward of Gondor to add two resources to Aragorn and used the two resources to purchase Nalth Guide, who makes it that Gimli doesn't need to exhaust to quest this turn.


 


In the quest phase I committed Aragorn for two, Gimli for two and Nalth Guide for one for five total willpower. I then drew Upper Hall for three which increases my threat to thirty five. Two progress goes onto stage 1B.


 


In the travel phase I travelled to Upper Hall.


 


In the combat phase the Goblin Spearman attacked Gimli for no damage. In return Legolas killed the Goblin Spearman, adding another two progress onto Upper Hall.


 


To end the turn I refreshed my cards before increasing my threat to thirty six.


 


Turn Three


 


At the start of the round I added a resource to all my heroes and drew Blade of Gondolin. I then exhausted Steward of Gondor to add two resoueces to Aragorn.


 


In the planning phase I used a resource from Aragorn to play Song of Battle on Aragorn. I then spent two resources each from Gimli and Legolas to play Citadel Plate on Aragorn before spending one resource from Aragorn to play Blade of Gondolin on Legolas.


 


Proceeding to the quest phase I committed Aragorn for two, Gimli for two and Nalth Guide for one for a total five willpower. I then drew another Goblin Spearman for two total threat. Three progress was made, two explored Upper Hall and one progress was added to stage 1B.


 


In the encounter phase I engaged the Goblin Spearman.


 


In the combat phase the Goblin Spearman attacked Aragorn, doing no damage. In return, Legolas attacked the Goblin Spearman, killing him and adding another two progress to stage 1B.


 


At the end of the turn I refreshed my cards before increasing my threat to thirty seven.


 


Turn Four


 


I added a resource to my heroes before drawing Boromir. I then exhausted Steward of Gondor to add two resources to Aragorn.


 


In the planning phase I used one resource each from Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas to play Bofur who I then exhausted to look for a Weapon in the top five cards of my deck. I hit lucky and put Dwarrowdelf Axe into my hand before spending a resource from Aragorn to play Dwarrowdelf Axe on Gimli. I ended the phase by spending the last two resources on Aragorn to play Celebrian's Stone on Aragorn.


 


In the quest phase I committed Aragorn for two, Gimli for two and Nalth Guide for one for a total five willpower. I then drew Goblin Scout for a total of three threat. Another two progress went onto stage 1B.


 


In the encounter phase the Goblin Scout engaged me before attacking Aragorn. The attack did no damage but the shadow card added a Goblin Swordsman to the staging area. Legolas then killed the Goblin Swordsman to add three progress to stage 1B.


 


At the end of the turn I refreshed my cards before raising my threat to thirty eight.


 


Turn Five


 


To begin the turn I added a resource to each hero, exhausted Steward of Gondor to add two more resources to Aragorn and drew Errand-Rider.


 


In the planning phase I used four resources from Aragorn to play Boromir before spending the last resource from Aragorn to play Errand-Rider.


 


In the quest phase I committed Aragorn for four, Nalth Guide for one and Bofur for two for a total seven willpower. I then drew Plundered Armory for a total of four threat. The three progress I made completes stage 1B.


 


Stage 2 removes the Book of Mazarbul from play.


 


In the travel phase I travel to the Plundered Armoury.


 


In the encounter phase the Goblin Swordsman engages me before attacking Aragorn and doing two damage to him. In revenge, Legolas kills the Goblin Swordsman and adds two progress to the Plundered Armoury, exploring it and adding Citadel Plate to Aragorn before adding one progress to stage 2B.


 


At the end of the turn I refreshed my cards before raising my threat to thirty nine.


 


Turn Six


 


As the turn started I added a resource to each hero, exhausted Steward of Gondor to add two more resources to Aragorn and drew Nalth Guide.


 


In the planning phase I used two resources from Aragorn to play Nalth Guide, nominating Aragorn to not have to commit to quest this turn.


 


In the quest phase I committed Aragorn for four, two Nalth Guides for two and Bofur for two for a total eight willpower. I then drew Goblin Swordsman for two before the regular staging draw was Goblin Spearman for a total four threat. Four progress went onto stage 2B.


 


In the encounter phase I engaged Goblin Spearman and Goblin Swordsman. The Goblin Spearman then attacked Aragorn, doing one damage while the Goblin Swordsman attacked Boromir, doing one damage and readying him. In return, Legolas attacked the Goblin Swordsman, killing him and adding three progress to stage 2B. Gimli and Boromir then attacked the Goblin Spearman and killed it.


 


At the end of the round I refreshed before increasing my threat to forty.


 


Turn Seven


 


To start with I added a resource to each hero, exhausted Steward of Gondor to add two more resources to Aragorn and drew another Errand-Rider.


 


In the planning phase I used one resource from Aragorn to play another Errand-Rider.


 


In the quest phase I committed Aragorn for four, Gimli for two, Legolas for one, two Nalth Guides for two, Bofur for two and Boromir for one for total twelve willpower.


 


I then draw for stage 2B for no effect before staging drawing Goblin Spearman for two total threat. Ten progress is made, completing the stage and winning the quest.


 


 


This deck was different to most decks I've played before. The heroes were tougher than most but the high threat adds a sense of urgency that most decks don't. All in all, it was fun and I'll definitely be using this deck for the next quest.

I have no idea how that happened, it's probably fate that when I did it was just after I had made a comment about how well the whole thing was going.

GAME 169 – ESCAPE FROM MORIA

 

Due to having to build a deck for a run-through of the Fellowship saga scenarios and having been told that all the nine members of the Fellowship have been blagged by the other players I had to go back to the drawing board.

 

Armed with a list of characters who were already taken I decided to go with a eclectic set of heroes. Bilbo Baggins for extra card draw, Denethor for encounter deck manipulation and Eowyn for questing. This gives me a useable starting threat of twenty six.

 

After a mulligan my starting hand was Erebor Hammersmith, Miner of the Iron Hills, Short Cut, Song of Travel, The Galadhrim's Greeting and Unexpected Courage.

 

Quest set-up was to add the Nameless Fear to the staging area and draw and add the Mountains Roots to the staging area before putting stage 1B into the victory display and selecting a random stage 2A.

 

Turn one begins with me adding a resource to all my heroes before drawing Elrond and Hasty Stroke.

 

Proceeding to the planning stage I used one resource from Bilbo to play Song of Travel on Denethor before using one resource each from Denethor and Eowyn to play Unexpected Courage on Denethor. I ended the phase by exhausting Denethor to look at the top card of the encounter deck, another The Mountains' Roots, and place it back at the top of the deck before exhausting Unexpected Courage to refresh him.

 

In the quest phase I committed Eowyn and Bilbo for a total of five willpower. I then flipped stage 2A to A Wrong Turn, which adds The Mountains' Roots to the staging area. In addition to the Nameless Fear (two) and the two The Mountains' Roots (one each) I drew Abandoned Tools, which was guarded by Fouled Well (three) for a total of seven threat. I discarded Elrond from my hand to avoid it surging. My threat was increased to twenty eight.

 

In the travel phase I travelled to the Fouled Well.

 

At the end of the combat phase I bypassed A Wrong Turn before exhausting Denethor to look at the top card of the encounter deck.it is a Chieftain of the Pit, who I put at the bottom of the encounter deck.

 

At the end of turn one I refreshed my cards before increasing my threat to twenty nine.

 

Turn Two

 

At the start of turn two I added a resource to my heroes before drawing Arwen Undomiel and Henamarth Riversong. This is a fine pair of cards to draw.

 

During planning I used one resource from Bilbo to play Henamarth Riversong, then used one resource each from Denethor and Eowyn to play Arwen Undomiel. I then exhausted Denethor to look at the top card of the deck, using Unexpected Courage to ready him. The card was another The Mountains' Roots which I returned to the top of the deck.

 

During questing I committed Eowyn for four, Bilbo for one, Arwen for two (adding her defence buff to Denethor) and Henamarth Riversong for one for a total of eight willpower.

 

I then flipped stage 2 to Escape From Darkness before drawing another The Mountains' Roots (I did shuffle the deck twice) for a total of five threat. Three progress is put onto Fouled Well before i exhausted Denethor to look at the top card of the encounter deck, Goblin Archer. I move it to the bottom of the deck.

 

At the end of the turn I refreshed my cards and raised my threat to thirty.

 

Turn Three

 

At the start of the turn I added a resource to my heroes before drawing Gleowine and the Galadhrim's Greeting.

 

In the planning phase I used one resource each from Bilbo and Denethor to pay for Gleowine, who I immediately to draw another Arwen Undomiel. I then exhausted Denethor to look at the top card of the encounter deck, exhausting Unexpected Courage to ready him. The card, Great Cave Troll, was sent to the bottom of the deck.

 

In the quest phase I committed Bilbo for one, Eowyn for four, Arwen for two (adding her defence buff to Denethor) and Henamarth Riversong for one. This gave me a total willpower of eight.

 

The staging draw was Massing In The Deep, which raises my threat to thirty one as well as adding another card, Sudden Pitfall, which discards Henamarth Riversong.

 

That leaves me with a reduced willpower of seven against five in the staging area. Two progress is placed onto Fouled Well, which explores it and allows me to exhaust Bilbo to attach Abandoned Tools to him. I then exhausted Denethor to look at the top card of the encounter deck, Undisturbed Bones, and place it at the bottom of the encounter deck.

 

In the travel phase I travelled to one of the The Mountains Roots.

 

At the end of the turn I refreshed my cards before increasing my threat to thirty two.

 

Turn Four

 

To start the turn I added a resource to all my heroes before drawing Daeron's Runes and Galadriel's Handmaiden. I immediately played Daeron's Runes to draw Elrond and Core Set Gandalf. I then discarded Elrond before exhausting Gleowine to draw another Daeron's Runes (I checked, and the card under Elrond in the discard pile was the last Daeron's Runes). I then played the Daeron's Runes to draw Lore of Imladris and Song of Travel. Still no Fast Hitch and I decided to discard the Song of Travel.

 

Finally moving onto the planning stage I used the two resources on Eowyn to play Galadriel's Handmaiden who lowers my threat to thirty one. I then spent one resource each from Bilbo and Denethor to play Erebor Hammersmith, which returns the Song of Travel to my hand.

 

In the quest phase I commit Eowyn for four, Denethor for one, Arwen for two (buffing Denethor), Galadriel's Handmaiden for two and Erebor Hammersmith for one for a total of ten willpower. before drawing Undisturbed Bones, which makes me do four damage to a ally. Gleowine takes the hit for the team. The total threat is four, meaning that six progress is put on The Mountains Roots, exploring it.

 

In the travel phase I travel to another The Mountains Roots. I then exhausted Unexpected Courage to refresh Denethor before exhausting him to look at the top card of the encounter deck, Goblin Spearman, and put him at the bottom of the deck.

 

At the end of the turn I refreshed all my cards before increasing my threat to thirty two and exhausting Bilbo to add one progress to stage 2B.

 

Turn Five

 

To start off I added a resource to all my heroes before drawing A Test Of Will and Fast Hitch.i then exhausted Denethor to look at the top card of the deck, Great Cave Troll, and put it at the bottom of the deck. I then used Unexpected Courage to refresh him.

 

In the planning stage I used one resource from Bilbo to give him Fast Hitch. I ended the phase by exhausting Denethor to look at the top card of the encounter deck, Shadow of Fear, and move it to the bottom of the deck.

 

In the quest phase I committed Eowyn for four, Arwen for two (buffing Bilbo) and Galadriel's Handmaiden for two for a total of eightm willpower.

 

The staging draw was another Fouled Well, which forces me to exhaust Bilbo and makes for a total of six threat. Four progress is made which explores the Mountains Roots. I then used Fast Hitch to refresh Bilbo,

 

In the travel phase I travelled to Fouled Well.

 

in the refresh phase I refresh all my cards before exhausting Bilbo to add a progress to stage 2B before readying him by exhausting Fast Hitch to exhaust him to do another progress onto stage 2B. I then increased my threat to thirty three.

 

Turn Six

 

With one progress left to make to finish the game all I need to do is finish the turn with Bilbo alive. With this in mind I added a resource to all my heroes before drawing Galadriel's Handmaiden and Imladris Stargazer. I then exhausted Denethor to look at the top card of the encounter deck, Goblin Spearman, which I put on the bottom of the deck. I then exhausted Unexpected Courage to refresh Denethor before exhausting him again to look at the top encounter card again. The card is Plundered Armoury which I put back at the top of the deck.

 

In the quest phase I commit Eowyn for four, Arwen for two, Galadriel's Handmaiden for two and Erebor Hammersmith for one for a total of nine willpower.

 

Not unsurprisingly, the top card is Armoury for three making a total of six threat. Three progress went onto Fouled Well.

 

At the end of the turn I refreshed and increased my threat to thirty four before using two resources from Eowyn and one from Denethor to play The Galadhrim's Greeting and drop my threat back to twenty eight. I then exhausted Bilbo to add a final progress to Escape From Darkness and win the game.

 

This was interesting. The addition of Bilbo instead of Gimli makes the deck more of a sneaky deck where avoiding fights is more important than winning them.

GAME 170 – THE REDHORN GATE


 


My new line-up is the 'E Team' consisting of Eladan, Elrohir and Eowyn. This gives me a starting threat of 29.


 


My starting hand was Errand-Rider, Galadhon Archer, Gondorian Spearman, Hasty Stroke, Steward of Gondor and Unexpected Courage.


 


Set-up for the quest consisted of Adding Caradhras to the staging area and Arwen as a ally before drawing Black Uruks to the staging area.


 


Turn One


 


I commenced the game by adding a resource to each of my heroes before drawing Hasty Stroke. I then used 1 resource from Elrohir to play Errand-Rider before exhausting the Errand-Rider to move a resource from Elladan to Eowyn. I then used the 2 resources on Eowyn to play Unexpected Courage on Elrohir.


 


In the quest phase I committed Elrohir for 1 (refreshing him with Unexpected Courage), Eowyn for 2 and Arwen Undomiel for 1 (adding her resource to Elrohir) for a total of 5 willpower.


 


In addition to Caradhras (3) and the Black Uruks (2) I drew Fell Voices which had no effect other than to surge to Mountain Wargs (2) for a total of 7 threat. My threat increased to 31.


 


In the encounter phase I engaged the Mountain Wargs who attacked Elrohir for a total of 5 attack. 2 damage went onto Elrohir.


 


Eladan then attacked, doing 1 point of damage to the Mountain Warg.


 


At the end of the turn I refreshed my cards before increasing my threat to 32.


 


Turn Two


 


After adding resources I drew Feint before I used the two resources on Elrohir to pay for Steward of Gondor and play it on Elrohir. I then exhausted Steward of Gondor to add 2 resources to Elrohir. I then exhausted Errand-Rider to move a resources from Elrohir to Elladan before spending two resources from Elladan to play Gondorian Spearman.


 


In the quest phase I committed Eowyn for 3 and Arwen for 1 (adding her resource to Elladan) for a total of 4 willpower.


 


In addition to Caradhras (3) and Black Uruks (2) I drew Warg Lair (1) which forced me to search the deck for another Mountain Wargs (2) for a total of 8 threat. My threat increases to 36.


 


In the travel phase I travelled to Warg Lair.


 


In the encounter phase I was forced to encounter Black Uruks and the new Mountain Wargs.


 


In the combat phase the Black Uruks attacked Elrohir for 3, doing no damage. Elrohir used Unexpected Courage to ready before before the wounded Mountain Warg attacked for 5, doing 2 damage and killing him. To end the combat round, the unwounded Mountain Warg attacked Elladan, doing 2 damage.


 


At this point, on turn two with a hero dead and three enemies engaged with me I decided to throw in the towel.

I just noticed something as I looked the cards over in preparation for the second tilt at the quest. I misread the Caradhras card and it explains something of a reason why I couldn't get anywhere in a try and a half.

GAME 171 - THE FORDS OF ISEN

Heroes: Eomer, Eowyn and Hama.

After talking to the guys who I'll hopefully be playing multi-player with at the weekend I found out that out of the three decks they're using no-one is using any Rohan heroes so I decided to do a deck to redress the balance. This deck went remarkably well, although all my heroes were bearing wounds at the end of the game due to the stage 2B time counter shortage. This was countered by drawing 7 cards on the one occasion where the time counters ran out and drawing no enemies. All in all it was a good first time out of the deck box for the Riddenmark's Finest.

## 213 [silverthorn on December 6, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1358772)

GAMES 172 THROUGH 177 - THE FELLOWSHIP SAGA BOXES

Decks: Eomer, Eowyn and Hama. Aragorn (Leadership), Gandalf and Glorfindel (Spirit). Merry (Tactics), Pippin and Sam Gamgee. Boromir (Leadership), Gimli and Legolas.

 

I've grouped these into one report since it went by in a rush for me and I was in too much of a hurry to really take notes (I really need to get more experience of multi-player play). During the game I wound up mostly using Hama's ability to recycle Feint to stop attacks on Frodo with Eowyn committing to quests and Eomer killing enemies when I needed to.

 

Highlights for me included: Eomer and Hama killing more than their fair share of Nazgul, Hama getting knocked down to one wound on about three occasions and Eowyn becoming a warrior (and getting Unexpected Courage so that she could contribute to fighting enemies.

 

Att the end of Breaking of the Fellowship I had managed to get my heroes through all six quests without losing a hero (although Haldir had taken the place of the fallen Legolas and Dwalin had taken the place of Gandalf after he thematically sacrificed himself against the Balrog in Moria). 

 

With Hama a prisoner of the Uruk-Hai the story was halted until the next box set comes out. After playing six games in a day I'm going to retire my Rohan deck in favour of something else.

GAME 178 - TO CATCH AN ORC

Heroes: Aragorn (Lore), Glorfindel (Spirit), Prince Imrahil

 

This was a deck design I've never tried before but, hoo boy did it work. It took a while because Mugash was the bottom enemy in my out-of-play deck but the game went a lot better than I expected. In the last turn I drew Gandalf so I hit Mugash for the last wounds I needed to take and quested for 27 (using Sword That Was Broken and Henamarth to know that there was a chump location coming out of the encounter deck) to win Stage 3B in a turn.

 

My final score was:

 

Completed Turns (11): 110

Threat: 33

Damage: 1

VP: 0

Total: 144

GAME 179 - INTO ITHILIEN

Heroes; Aragorn (Lore), Glorfindel (Spirit), Prince Imrahil

 

This deck again showed it's quality as I shot through this quest at great speed. By the time I had Faramir and Blade That Was Broken in play I managed to quest for 18, just beating the threat on Stage 2B and beat the quest.

 

My score was:

Completed Turns (3): 30

Threat: 39

Hero Damage: 0

Dead Hero: 0

VP: 0

Total: 69

GAME 180 - THE DUNLAND TRAP

 

Heroes; Aragorn (Lore), Glorfindel (Spirit), Prince Imrahil

 

This one was closer than the points (and final threat) suggest. I survived mostly by killing ridiculous amounts of allies. My threat is so low because I drew all three Elrond's Counsels in turn one and blew the lot, knowing that they would be discarded by the time counter effect. My final score was:

 

Completed Turns (10): 100

Threat: 24

Damage on surviving heroes: 5

VP: 4

Total: 135

GAME 181 - THE THREE TRIALS

 

Heroes: Beorn, Beregond, Eowyn

I decided to try this deck out for size and it worked pretty well. Lots of Eagle and questy allies (and, in a first for me, a game where hero Gandalf was not involved and I didn't play Core Gandalf). The game was a bloody affair but I squeeked a win.

 

The final score was:

Completed Turns (10): 100

Threat: 38

Damage on Surviving heroes: 17

VP: 15

Total: 138.

GAME 182 - TROUBLE IN THARBAD

 

Heroes; Beorn, Beregond, Eowyn

 

This mission disproved the one doubt I had about this deck, that the questers couldn't operate as fast as Beorn and Beregond could handle combat. After I got all three Ethir Swordsmen into play I was questing for 20-odd per turn. The game went better than I had expected.

18 more games. Dang. You're playing a dozen games to my 1 or 2. I wish I had the time for that.

I think that as soon as I finish Celebrimbor's Secret I'll temporarily call a halt until The Antlered Crown (I think that's the name, the last release in this cycle) comes out. I may go back to playing games online where I only use the cards released when the quest was released since it was fun, if more challenging.

GAME 183 - PASSAGE THROUGH MIRKWOOD (PROGRESSION)

Heroes: Denethor, Eowyn, Gimli

 

I decided to go back to playing through all the quests in release order online. The deck I tried worked well as Denethor (as soon as I got a Unexpected Courage on him) filtered out most of the risky cards in the deck.

## 222 [silverthorn on December 11, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1364132)

GAME 184 - THE NIN-IN-ELIPH

Heroes; Gimli, Nori, Thalin

 

I keep on being drawn back to playing Dwarves, I decided to try a non-Dain deck and it ran a little slowly compared to the others I've tried so I may make a few substitutions before I play Celebrimbor's Secret. Regardless, a win is a win (although the only thing which stopped me threating out was Nori's ability.

GAME 185 - JOURNEY DOWN THE ANDUIN (PROGRESSION)

Heroes: Denethor, Eowyn, Gimli

The deck once again made great use of Denethor's ability to see the top encounter card but I was on turn 22 when I ended the game in a sweet, hard thought victory. I managed to kill the enemies as they came up on stage 2 and the staging area was clear of enemies when I proceeded to stage 3.

## 224 [silverthorn on December 11, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1364379)

GAME 186 - CELEBRIMBOR'S SECRET

Heroes: Bifur, Dain Ironfoot, Nori

 

This deck made this deck seem a lot easier than I suspect it is. I was on stage 2 on turn 6 when I used Untroubled By Darkness, quested enough to hit 12 progress, then used Lure of Moria to ready everyone, let a Zigil Minor take the hit from Bellach and killed him with nine angry Dwarves.

## 225 [silverthorn on December 12, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1364624)

GAME 187 - ESCAPE FROM DOL GOLDUR (PROGRESSION)

Heroes: Denethor, Eowyn, Gimli

This was a scrappy affair, all my heroes had at best 2 wounds left and I had gotten through a ridiculously high amount of allies. I hit lucky that Gimli was the captured hero and two of the Guarding cards on the objectives were treachery. All in all, I got exceedingly lucky with my draw.

GAME 188 - HUNT FOR GOLLUM (PROGRESSION)

Heroes: Denethor, Eowyn, Gimli

This deck, once again, performed well. It may not work quickly but it gets results once I can get a Unexpected Courage onto Denethor. My final score was

GAME 189 - PASSAGE THROUGH MIRKWOOD

Heroes: Aragon (Lore), Frodo Baggins, Glorfindel (Spirit).

This game went better than I half expected. Getting Song of Wisdom and A Burning Brand in my starting hand made it that I was rarely raising my threat due to using Frodo as designated defender and my decision to put a few cards to draw other cards (three Ancient Mathon and a Daeron's Runes) worked out when I drew 6 cards in turn two.

 

To sum up, a style of deck I've rarely if ever used worked out a lot better than I thought it would.

GAME 191 - PASSAGE THROUGH MIRKWOOD

Heroes: Celeborn, Elrond and Galadriel & Haldir of Lorien, Legolas and Mirlonde.

 

Using the decks from the Second Breakfast articles I tried the easiest quest in the game. The game went well, although I hit a ridiculous amount of locations and the decks seemed to work well together. All in all, a decent start.

## 231 [silverthorn on December 22, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1376941)

GAME 192 : PASSAGE THROUGH MIRKWOOD

 

For this game I decided to try a variation on my most-used hero selection (Beregond, Eowyn, Legolas), substituting Spirit Glorfindel for Legolas. This gave me a starting threat of 24.

 

My starting hand was Defender of Rammas x2, Elrond's Counsel, Gondorian Shield, Light of Valinor and Unexpected Courage. This gave me pretty much all the high-priority cards I wanted.

 

Quest set-up consisted of placing Forest Spider and Old Forest Road.

 

Turn one began with me adding a resource to all my heroes before drawing Northern Tracker.

 

During planning I played Gondorian Shield on Beregond before I paid 1 resource from Glorfindel to play Light of Valinor on Glorfindel.

 

In the quest phase I committed Glorfindel before playing Elrond's Counsel to add a willpower and reduce my threat to 21. I then committed Eowyn for a total of 8 willpower.

 

In addition to the 3 threat currently in the staging area I drew another Forest Spider for a total of 5 threat. 3 progress was placed on stage 1B. 

 

In the travel phase I travelled to Old Forest Road, using it's ability to ready Eowyn.

 

In the encounter phase I optionally engaged one of the Forest Spiders, who immediately attacked Beregond. The shadow card was Enchanted Stream which did nothing. The attack did no damage and Eomer and Glorfindel attacked for 4, doing 3 damage.

 

At the end of the turn I refreshed everything before increasing my threat to 22.

 

Turn two commenced with me adding a resource to all my heroes before drawing Song of Travel.

 

In the planning phase I paid 2 resources from Beregond to play Defender from Rammas. I then paid 2 resources from Eomer to play Unexpected Courage on Beregond.

 

During the quest phase I committed Eomer and Glorfindel for 7 willpower. In addition to the 2 threat in the staging area I drew Great Forest Web for 4 total threat. I made 3 progress, exploring Old Forest Road.

 

In the travel phase I travelled to Great Forest Web, exhausting Beregond, then refreshing him with Unexpected Courage.

 

After declining to engage the Forest Spider in the staging area, the other Forest Spider attacked Beregond again. The shadow card was Old Forest Road, for no effect and the Spider did no damage. In return Glorfindel and Eowyn attacked for 4 killing it.

 

At the end of the turn I refreshed everything before raising my threat to 23.

 

At the start of turn 3 I added a resource to all my heroes before drawing Northern Tracker.

 

During planning I paid 1 resource from Glorfindel to play Song of Travel on Beregond.

 

In the quest phase I committed Eomer and Glorfindel for a total of 7 willpower. In addition to the 2 in the staging area I drew East Bight Patrol for a total of 5 threat. 2 progress was placed on Great Forest Web, exploring it.

 

Skipping the travel phase I was forced to engage the East Bight Patrol, who attacked Beregond. The shadow card was Dol Goldur Orcs, who increased the Patrol's attack to 4, which meant that they still did no damage to Beregond.

 

I then attacked the Patrol with Glorfindel, killing them.

 

At the end of the turn I refreshed my cards before raising my threat to 24.

 

Turn four began with me adding a resource to all my heroes before drawing Gandalf (Core).

 

Planning began with me paying 2 resources from Beregond to play another Defender of Rammas and 2 resources each from Eomer and Glorfindel to play Northern Tracker.

 

In the quest phase I committed Eowyn, Glorfindel and the Northern Tracker for a total 8 threat. In addition to the 2 threat in the staging area I drew The Necromancer's Reach, which added 1 damage to Eowyn and the Northern Tracker. The total threat was 2 so I added 6 progress to stage 1B, exploring it and moving onto stage 2B.

 

After skipping the travel phase I engaged the Forest Spider, who attacked Beregond. The shadow card was Chieftain Ufthak, for no effect. The Forest Spider did no damage. Glorfindel and the 2 Defenders of Rammas attacked for 5, killing the Spider.

 

At the end of the turn I refreshed all my cards before raising my threat to 25.

 

To kick off turn 5 I added a resource to each hero before drawing Gondorian Shield.

 

With nothing to do in the planning stage I committed Eowyn and Glorfindel as well as the Northern Tracker before discarding the Gondorian Shield in my hand for a total of 9 willpower.

 

With nothing in the staging area I drew another Forest Spider for a total of 2 threat. 7 progress was made, more than enough to explore stage 2B. I had to select a stage 3B and I hit lucky drawing “Beorn's Path”. 

 

Skipping the travel phase the Forest Spider attacked Celeborn. The shadow card was Great Forest Web, for no effect. The spider did no damage and Glorfindel and the 2 Defenders Of Rammas attacked for 5, killing it.

 

At the end of the episode I refreshed all the cards and raised my threat to 26.

 

Turn six started with me adding a resource to all my heroes before drawing Feint. I proceeded to pay 2 resources each from Eomer and Glorfindel to play another Northern Tracker.

 

In the quest phase I committed Eowyn, Glorfindel and 2 Northern Trackers for a total of 9 willpower. With a empty staging area I drew Dol Goldur Beastmaster for a total of 2 threat. 7 progress was placed on stage 3B.

 

After skipping travel the Dol Goldur Beastmaster attacked Beregond. The shadow cards were Enchanted Stream and Mountains of Mirkwood for no effect and the attack did no damage before Beregond refreshed by exhausting Unexpected Courage.

 

Beregond, Glorfindel and the 2 Defenders of Rammas then attacked, killing the Dol Goldur Beastmaster before I ended the turn by refreshing all my cards and raising my threat to 27.

 

Turn 7 began with me adding resources before drawing Arwen Undomiel. 

 

During planning I paid 1 resource each from Glorfindel and Eowyn to play Arwen Undomiel.

 

In the quest phase I committed Eowyn, Glorfindel, Arwen Undomiel and 2 Northern Trackers for 11 willpower. With the staging area still empty I drew Hummerhorns for a total of 1 threat. 10 progress was made, far more than I needed to complete stage 3B and win the game.

 

The final score was:

 

Completed turns (6): 60

Threat: 27

Damage: 1

Total Score: 88

GAME 193: PASSAGE THROUGH MIRKWOOD (PROGRESSION)
Heroes: Eowyn, Gimli, Legolas

Trying this with a new hero combo for my efforts using only cards from the core set. Things went well after a less than brilliant start. After picking up a good few wounds and losing 5 events to one card I managed to get a win. My score was as follows:

 

7 completed rounds = 70

Total combined Threat = 37

Total damage on Heroes = 6

Cost of dead Heroes = 0

Victory points = 0

TOTAL SCORE = 113

GAME 194: JOURNEY DOWN THE ANDUIN (PROGRESSION)

Heroes: Eowyn, Gimli, Legolas

For this game I was blighted with some of the worst card draw I've ever had to suffer through. Having to use a Will Of The West with no cards in my discard pile (just in the hope of maybe getting some decent cards) barely solved it. I managed to barely win the game.

 

14 completed rounds = 140
Total combined Threat = 48
Total damage on Heroes = 7
Cost of dead Heroes = 0
Victory points = 8
TOTAL SCORE = 187

GAME 195: PASSAGE THROUGH MIRKWOOD

Heroes; Celeborn, Haldir of Lorien, Legolas.

 

This game went well, despite my drawing 2 Leadership cards in the whole game (thankfully the first one was O Lorien). Everyone did what was needed and everything went to plan. My score was:

 

Completed rounds (6): 60

Total Threat: 38.

Total Cost: 98

5 more to go my friend! Almost there.

I've been holding out for Antlered Crown coming out in the UK but I got sick of waiting. I think I'm probably going to keep going past 200 games to see how many games I can play before March 19th since that will be a year since I started this whole thing.

## 237 [silverthorn on December 31, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1387446)

GAME 196: JOURNEY DOWN THE ANDUIN

Heroes: Celeborn, Haldir of Lorien, Legolas.

This one was a slog but worked out (mostly because I didn't go with my first instinct and mulligan when I didn't have O Lorien in my opening hand but did get Black Arrow, Sneak Attack and Core Set Gandalf in it). After sneak attacking Gandalf to do 4 damage I then had Haldir shoot the troll to death with the Black Arrow in the combat phase without it leaving the staging area.

 

After that it was a case of slowly but surely questing through while killing the enemies which cropped up (Haldir is really handy against Goblin Snipers). My final score was:

 

Completed Turns (9): 90

Threat: 42.

VP: 5.

Total Score: 127.

GAME 197: ESCAPE FROM DOL GOLDUR

Heroes: Denethor, Eowyn, Gimli

Trying a new (old) set of heroes I hit lucky. Gimli was the prisoner and I barely managed to survive long enough to get him released. As it was, Eowyn managed to quest to victory after losing all my other heroes. After 13 turns I didn't want to think about what the score was but it was a victory.

## 239 [silverthorn on January 14, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1406393)

OK I've decided to accept the challenge. So far I played 1 game last week with a friend.

I plan on playing at least 2 games tomorrow night

## 241 [silverthorn on January 15, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1406870)

This has turned out to be a lot of fun (despite a lot of things restricting the amount of time I've had to play the game since I started). Good luck.

## 242 [Darkjawa on January 15, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1407372)

So I played a solo game last night to test a new deck. Beat passage through Murkwood and beat it pretty easily using Aragorn, Denethor aand Faramir as my heroes. Only 198 more to go.

## 243 [silverthorn on January 19, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1412610)

GAME 199: JOURNEY DOWN THE ANDUIN

Heroes: Merry, Pippin (Lore), Sam Gamgee.

This was supposed to be a one-off look at the feasibility of a solo Hobbit deck but the deck turned out to be a lot of fun so I'm going to give this hero set-up another try.

 

In the end the score was:

Completed Turns (8): 80

Threat: 25.

Damage: 0

VP: 10

Total ScoreL 95.

GAME 200  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] : A SHADOW OF THE PAST

Heroes: Beregond, Eowyn, Haldir of Lorien.

 

Since I finally got my hands on the Dark Forest I decided to give the Fellowship saga another go. I used a variation on a old deck and it seemed to go well. Getting a Rivendell Blade and Bow of the Galadhrim onto Haldir in the first two turns turned him into a excellent sniper against the Black Riders, softening them up for when I had to engage them. All in all, I managed to beat the quest and add Mister Underhill and Gandalf's Delay to my campaign log.

First of all, congratulations for achieving your goal...

 

Second, i really enjoyed your writing and the way you demonstrate how you played the game.

 

 

Now keep it up and go for the 250 until 19th March 

## 246 [silverthorn on January 23, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1418528)

Thank you.

I'm planning to keep recording the games until then to see just how many games I can play so it should be interesting.

GAME 201: A SHADOW OF THE PAST

 

I decided to go through the Fellowship Of The Ring scenarios and write them up using a all-Rohan starting team.

 

PLAYER SET-UP

Eomer

Eowyn

Frodo Baggins (with Mister Underhill and The One Ring).

Hama

 

Starting Threat: 28.

Starting Hand: Feint, Guthlaf, Hasty Stroke, Westfold Horse-Breeder and Westfold Outrider.

 

QUEST SET-UP

 

Phase: 1B (0/1 progress).

Active Location: Bag End (0/3 progress)

Gandalf's Delay.

Staging Area: Black Rider I.

 

TURN ONE


The game began with me adding a resource to all my heroes before drawing another Westfold Outrider.

 

Proceeding to planning I paid 1 resource from Eowyn to play Westfold Horse-Breeder I. She allowed me to place Firefoot into my hand before reshuffling my deck. I then paid 1 resource each from Eomer and Hama to play Westfold Outrider I.

 

Proceeding to questing I committed Eowyn and Westfold Horse-Breeder I for a total of 5 willpower. In addition to the 4 threat in play I drew Crawling Towards Him, which I exhausted the One Ring and paid 1 resource from Frodo to reshuffle back into the deck. The replacement card was Evil Crow, which made for a total 6 threat. I raised my threat to 29.

 

After skipping travel I engaged the Evil Crow, who attacked the Westfold Outrider I. The shadow card was Lure Of The Ring, which increased the Evil Crow's attack to 2, doing 1 damage to Westfold Outrider I.

 

In response Eomer attacked the Evil Crow for 3 damage, killing it.

 

To end the turn I refreshed my cards before raising my threat to 30.

 

TURN TWO

 

Eomer

Eowyn

Frodo Baggins (with Mister Underhill and The One Ring).

Hama

 

Allies: Westfold Horse-Breeder I and Westfold Outrider I (1 wound remaining).

Threat: 30.

Hand: Feint, Firefoot, Guthlaf, Hasty Stroke and Westfold Outrider.

 

Phase: 1B (0/1 progress).

Active Location: Bag End (0/3 progress).

Gandalf's Delay.

Staging Area: Black Rider I.

 

I started the turn by adding a resource to all my heroes before drawing Song Of Travel.

 

In the planning phase I paid 1 resource each from Eomer and Hama to play Firefoot on Eomer.

 

In the quest phase I again committed Eowyn and Westfold Horse-Breeder I for 5 total willpower. In addition to the 4 threat in the staging area I drew Lure of the Ring, which forced me to exhaust the One Ring before surging to Banfurlong for a total 6 threat. My threat increased to 31.

 

After skipping travel I optionally engaged Black Rider I who attacked the Westfold Outrider. The shadow card was another Black Rider for no effect and the attack over-killed Westfold Outrider I.

 

The death of Westfold Outrider I buffed Eomer, who, alongside Hama attacked Black Rider I for a whopping 10 damage, killing it.

 

To end the turn I refreshed my cards before raising my threat.

 

TURN THREE

 

Eomer (with Firefoot).

Eowyn (1 resource).

Frodo (1 resource, with Mister Underhill and the One Ring).

Hama.

 

Westfold Horse-Breeder I.

 

Threat: 32.

Hand: Feint, Guthlaf, Hasty Stroke, Song of Travel and Westfold Outrider.

 

Stage: 1B (0/1 progress).

Active Location: Bag End (0/3 progress).

Gandalf's Delay.

Staging Area: Banfurlong.

 

I started the turn by adding a resource to all my heroes before drawing Rohan Warhorse.

 

In the planning phase I paid 1 resource each from Eomer and Hama to play Guthlaf. I then paid 1 resource from Frodo to add Song of Travel to Eomer.

 

In the quest phase I committed Eowyn and Westfold Horse-Breeder I for a total of 5 willpower. In addition to the 3 threat in the staging area I drew another Black Rider, which I paid 1 resource from Frodo and exhausted The One Ring to shuffle back into my deck. The replacement card was Gildor Inglorion which became a ally. The total threat was 2. 3 progress was placed on Bag End, which was explored, allowing me to draw Westfold Horse-Breaker before Bag End was added to the victory display.

 

After travelling to Banfurlong I refreshed all my cards before discarding Gildon Inglorion and raising my threat.

 

TURN FOUR

 

Eomer (with Firefoot).

Eowyn (2 resources).

Frodo (with Mister Underhill and the One Ring).

Hama.

 

Guthlaf, Westfold Horse-Breeder I.

 

 

Threat: 33.

Hand: Feint, Hasty Stroke, Rohan Warhorse, Westfold Horse-Breaker and Westfold Outrider.

Victory Points: 1 (Bag End).

 

Stage: 1B (0/1 progress).

Active Location: Banfurlong (0/2 progress).

Gandalf's Delay.

Staging Area: Empty.

 

I started the turn by adding resources before drawing Spear Of The Mark.

 

Moving on to planning I paid 1 resource from Eomer to play Spear of the Mark on him before paying 1 resource from Hama to play Rohan Warhorse on him. I then paid 2 resources from Eowyn to play Westfold Horse-Breaker I.

 

In the quest phase I committed Eowyn, Westfold Horse-Breaker I and Westfold Horse-Breeder I for a total of 6 willpower. With no threat in the staging area I drew Black Steed which was discarded after surging to Lure of The Ring, which forced me to exhaust the One Ring before surging to Crawling Towards Him, which I did nothing to avoid a Hide 2 test. The draws were Stock Road and Evil Crow for 5 threat. The Hide test failed with no ill-effects.

 

In the end the threat total was 0 so 2 progress was placed on Banfurlong, exploring it and sending it to the staging area before I added 4 progress to stage 1B, exploring it.

 

Stage 2B forced me to add a Black Rider to the staging area before I skipped the travel phase and optionally engaged the Black Rider.

 

The Black Rider attacked Guthlaf. The shadow card was the Marish, buffing the Black Rider and making Guthlaf even more dead than he would have been.

 

Buffed by Guthlaf's sacrifice, Eomer and Hama attacked the Black Rider for 11 damage, killing it.

 

At the end of the turn I refreshed my cards before raising my threat again.

 

TURN FIVE

 

Eomer (with Firefoot, Song of Travel and Spear of the Mark).

Eowyn (1 resource).

Frodo (1 resource, with Mister Underhill and the One Ring).

Hama (with Rohan Warhorse).

 

Westfold Horse-Breaker I, Westfold Horse-Breeder I.

 

Threat: 34.

Hand: Feint, Hasty Stroke and Westfold Outrider.

Victory Points: 2 (Bag End, Banfurlong).

 

Stage: 2B (0/14 progress).

Active Location: None.

Gandalf's Delay.

Staging Area: Empty.

 

I started the turn by adding resources before drawing Unexpected Courage.

 

In the planning phase I paid 1 resource each from Eomer and Hama to play Westfold Outrider I. I then paid 2 resources from Eowyn to play Unexpected Courage on Eomer.

 

In the quest phase I committed Eowyn, Westfold Horse-Breeder I and Westfold Horse-Breaker I for 6 total willpower. I then drew Piercing Cry, which forced me to add a Black Rider from the encounter deck engaged with me. I then made 6 progress towards stage 2B.

 

After skipping travel and encounter phases the Black Rider attacked Westfold Outrider I. The shadow card was Have You Seen Baggins? Which did nothing before the Black Rider killed Westfold Outrider I.

 

Buffed by the death of the Outrider, Eomer and Hama attacked the Black Rider for 11 damage, killing it.

 

To end the turn I refreshed my cards before raising my threat again.

 

TURN SIX

 

Eomer (with Firefoot, Song of Travel, Spear of the Mark and Unexpected Courage).

Eowyn.

Frodo (2 resource, with Mister Underhill and the One Ring).

Hama (with Rohan Warhorse).

 

Westfold Horse-Breaker I, Westfold Horse-Breeder I.

 

Threat: 35.

Hand: Feint and Hasty Stroke.

Victory Points: 2 (Bag End, Banfurlong).

 

Stage: 2B (6/14 progress).

Active Location: None.

Gandalf's Delay.

Staging Area: Empty.

 

I started by adding a resource to my heroes before drawing Mustering the Rohirrim, which I immediately played to pull the last Westfold Outrider out of my deck.

 

In the planning phase I paid 1 resource each from Eomer and Hama to play Westfold Outrider I.

 

During the quest phase I committed Eowyn, Westfold Horse-Breaker I and Westfold Horse-Breeder I for 6 willpower. I then drew Have You Seen Baggins?, which I paid 1 resource from Frodo and exhausted the One Ring to reshuffle back into my deck. The replacement card was Pathless Country for a total of 2 threat. 4 progress was placed on stage 2B.

 

After travelling to Pathless Country, I refreshed all my cards and raised my threat.

 

TURN SEVEN

 

Eomer (with Firefoot, Song of Travel, Spear of the Mark and Unexpected Courage).

Eowyn (1 resource).

Frodo (2 resource, with Mister Underhill and the One Ring).

Hama (with Rohan Warhorse).

 

Westfold Horse-Breaker I, Westfold Horse-Breeder I, Westfold Outrider I.

 

Threat: 36.

Hand: Feint and Hasty Stroke.

Victory Points: 2 (Bag End, Banfurlong).

 

Stage: 2B (10/14 progress).

Active Location: Pathless Country (0/3 progress).

Gandalf's Delay.

Staging Area: Empty.

 

At the start of the turn I added a resource to my heroes before drawing Citadel Plate.

 

During the quest phase I committed Eowyn, Westfold Horse-Breaker I and Westfold Horse-Breeder I for 6 willpower. I then drew another Pathless Country for 2 threat. 3 progress was placed on the active Pathless Country, exploring it before adding 1 progress to stage 2B.

 

After travelling to the new Pathless Country I ended the turn by refreshing my cards and raising my threat.

 

TURN EIGHT

 

Eomer (with Firefoot, Song of Travel, Spear of the Mark and Unexpected Courage).

Eowyn (1 resource).

Frodo (2 resource, with Mister Underhill and the One Ring).

Hama (with Rohan Warhorse).

 

Westfold Horse-Breaker I, Westfold Horse-Breeder I, Westfold Outrider I.

 

Threat: 37.

Hand: Citadel Plate, Feint and Hasty Stroke.

Victory Points: 2 (Bag End, Banfurlong).

 

Stage: 2B (11/14 progress).

Active Location: Pathless Country (0/3 progress).

Gandalf's Delay.

Staging Area: Empty.

 

I started the turn by adding a resource to my heroes before drawing Westfold Horse-Breeder.

 

In the planning phase I paid 1 resource from Eowyn to play Westfold Horse-Breeder II, which drew nothing from my deck.

 

During the planning phase I committed Eowyn, Westfold Horse-Breaker and Westfold Horse-Breeder's I & II for a total of 7 willpower. I then drew Hunting For The Ring, which added 2 to my threat and made for a total of 0 willpower. 7 progress was made, 3 of which explored Pathless Country and 3 explored stage 2B.

 

Stage 3A added Buckleberry Ferry to the staging area and Stage 3B added another Black Rider to the staging area.

 

During the travel phase I committed Frodo and Eomer to make a Hide 3 test with 3 willpower (I then exhausted Unexpected Courage to refresh Eomer). The three cards were 2 Crawling Towards Him and The Ring Draws Them for no threat. I successfully travelled to the Buckleberry Ferry.

 

In the encounter phase I engaged the Black Rider, who attacked the new Westfold Outrider I. The shadow card was Hunting For The Ring, for no effect so the Black Rider killed Westfold Outrider I before the buffed Eomer and Hama attacked it for 11, killing the Black Rider.

 

At the end of the turn I refreshed my cards before raising my threat again.

 

TURN NINE


Eomer (1 resource, with Firefoot, Song of Travel, Spear of the Mark and Unexpected Courage).

Eowyn (1 resource).

Frodo (3 resources, with Mister Underhill and The One Ring).

Hama (with Rohan Warhorse).

 

Westfold Horse-Breaker I, Westfold Horse-Breeders I & II.

Threat: 40.

Hand: Citadel Plate, Feint, Hasty Stroke.

 

Stage 3B.

Active Location: Buckleberry Ferry (0/9 progress).

Gandalf's Delay.

Staging Area: Empty.

 

To start the turn I added a resource to my heroes before drawing Escort From Edoras.

 

In the planning phase I paid 2 resources from Eowyn to play Escort From Edoras I.

 

In the quest phase I committed Eomer (exhausting Unexpected Courage to ready him), Eowyn, Frodo, Westfold Horse-Breaker I, Westfold Horse-Breeder I & II and Escort From Edoras I. This gave me a impressive 14 willpower.

 

Needing 9 progress to complete the quest and knowing that I had nothing in the staging area I drew Green Hill Country for 2 threat. 12 progress was made, 3 more than I needed to explore the Buckleberry Ferry and complete the quest.

 

To end the quest I decided to add Gandalf's Delay and Mister Underhill to the campaign pool.

 

My final score was:

 

Completed turns (8): 80

Threat: 40.

Hero Damage: 0.

VP: 2

Total Score: 118.

Can you post your deck you used when you log? That would help beginners like me :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

thank you!

I'll do that. I'll set up a thread in the Strategy and Deck Building forum to post the deck used in each game (with links if I can work out how to do it). After having spectacularly bad luck with the Dark Forest I'm thinking about going for restarting the Fellowship quests again with a deck which has some Lore in it. I will post after I've built a deck and played through Shadow of the Past again.

GAME 202: PASSAGE THROUGH MIRKWOOD

Heroes: Elrond, Gandalf and Glorfindel (Spirit).

Deck: Mark I http://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/133239-my-solo-decks/ [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/133239-my-solo-decks/]

 

I decided to try this hero combo from the start of the quests. Things went well, if a little slowly since some of the main cards didn't show up until late in the game but I beat the game in 9 turns with some damage to my heroes. I amassed a win so things started well.

## 251 [silverthorn on January 28, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1425062)

GAME 202: PASSAGE THROUGH MIRKWOOD

Deck: Mark II: http://community.fan...-my-solo-decks/ [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/133239-my-solo-decks/]

 

For this I decided to try a all-Silvan hero combo consisting of Celeborn, Haldir & Legolas. This gave me a threat of 29.

 

My starting hand was Defender of the Nalth, Galadhon Archer, Galadhrim Minstrel x2, Gandalf (Core) and Orophin.

 

Since I didn't get certain cards I decided to mulligan, drawing Defender of the Nalth, Feint, Mirkwood Runner, O Lorien!, Silvan Tracker and Silverlode Archer.

 

Quest set-up consisted of adding Forest Spider and Old Forest Road to the staging area.

 

Turn One began with me adding resources to my heroes before drawing Elven Mail.

 

During planning I paid 1 resource from Celeborn to play O Lorien on Celeborn before exhausting O Lorien and paying 1 resource each from Haldir and Legolas to play Defender of the Nalth I.

 

In the quest phase I committed Celeborn and Haldir for 5 willpower. In addition to the 3 threat in the staging area I drew Driven By Shadow, which pushed the threat to 5. No progress was added.

 

After travelling to Old Forest Road and readying Haldir, the Forest Spider attacked the buffed Defender of the Nalth I doing no damage. Haldir and Legolas then attacked for 6 damage, killing the Forest Spider and adding 2 progress to Old Forest Road.

 

At the end of the turn I refreshed my cards and increased my threat to 30.

 

Turn Two began with me adding a resource to my heroes before drawing Bow of the Galadhrim.

 

In the planning stage I paid 1 resource from Legolas to play Bow of the Galadhrim on Haldir.

 

During the quest phase I committed Celeborn for 3 willpower. With a empty staging area I drew The Necromancer's Reach, which added 1 wound to Celeborn. 1 progress was added to Old Forest Road, discarding it before 2 progress was added to stage 1B.

 

To end the turn I refreshed my cards before raising my threat to 31.

 

 

Turn Three began with me adding resources before I drew another Elven Mail.

 

In the planning phase I exhausted O Lorien before paying 2 resources from Haldir to play Silvan Tracker I.

 

In the quest phase I committed Celeborn and Silvan Tracker I for 5 willpower. With a empty staging area I drew Dol Goldur Orcs, which inflicted 2 damage on Silvan Tracker I and made for total of 2 threat. 3 progress was added to stage 1B.

 

After skipping travel the Dol Goldur Orcs attacked Defender of the Nalth I, doing no damage. In response, Haldir and Legolas attacked the Dol Goldur Orcs and killed them, adding 2 progress to stage 1B.

 

I ended the turn by refreshing my cards, removing a wound from Celeborn and Silvan Tracker I (thanks to the afore-mentioned Silvan Tracker) and raised my threat to 32.

 

Turn Four began with me adding resources before drawing Feint.

 

In the planning phase I exhausted O Lorien before paying 2 resources from Celeborn to play Silverlode Archer I.

 

During questing I committed Celeborn, Silvan Tracker I and Silverlode Archer I for 6 total willpower. With a still-empty staging area I drew Forest Gate for a total 2 threat. 4 progress was made, more than enough to explore stage 1B and move onto stage 2B.

 

I opted to travel to Forest Gate, which allowed me to draw O Lorien and The Tree People before I ended the turn by refreshing all my cards, healing the last wound on Silvan Tracker I and raising my threat to 33.

 

Turn Five began with me adding resources before drawing Rivendell Blade.

 

In the planning phase I paid 1 resource from Legolas to play Rivendell Blade on Haldir. I then exhausted O Lorien and paid 2 resources from Haldir to play Mirkwood Runner I. I then ended the phase by paying 2 resources from Legolas to play Elven Mail on Defender of the Nalth I.

 

In the quest phase I committed Celeborn, Silvan Tracker I, Silverlode Archer I and Mirkwood Runner I for 7 willpower. With a empty staging area I drew Old Forest Road for 1 threat. 6 progress was made, 4 discarded Forest Gate and the last 2 explored stage 2B.

 

Thankfully, the stage 3B was “Beorn's Path” so I travelled to Old Forest Road before risking playing The Tree People, returning Mirkwood Runner I to my hand and putting Galadhrim Minstrel I into play. Her ability allowed me to pull another The Tree People into my hand so I did the same thing again, putting Galadhrim Minstrel into my hand and putting Henamarth Riversong into play. I then exhausted Henamarth to look at the top card of the deck, Chieftain Ufthak, and return him to the top of the deck.

 

I then refreshed all my cards before raising my threat to 34.

 

Turn Six began with me adding resources before drawing Wingfoot.

 

In the planning phase I paid 1 resource from Haldir to play Wingfoot on him before exhausting O Lorien and paying another resource from Haldir to play Galadhrim Minstrel I. I then failed to pull a event using her ability.

 

Knowing what was coming I committed Celeborn, Haldir (calling “Enemy” for Wingfoot), Silvan Tracker I and Galadhrim Minstrel I for 8 willpower. With a empty staging area I unsurprisingly drew Chieftain Ufthak for 2 threat (which readied Haldir). 6 progress was made, the first 3 discarded Old Forest Road and the last 3 were added to stage 3B.

 

After skipping travel Chieftain Ufthak attacked Defender of the Nalth I, doing 1 damage. In response Haldir, Legolas and Silverlode Archer I attacked for 9 damage, killing Chieftain Ufthak, adding him to the victory display and adding 2 progress to stage 3B. I then exhausted Henamarth Riversong to look at the top card of the deck, Caught In A Web, before returning it to the top of the deck.

 

At the end of the turn I refreshed all my cards, healed the wound on Defender of the Nalth I and raised my threat to 35.

 

Turn Seven began with me adding resources before drawing Orophin.

 

After skipping planning I committed everyone but the Defender of the Nalth I for a total of 10 willpower. The draw was Caught In A Web, which I placed on Celeborn since the 10 progress was more than enough to explore stage 3B and end the game.

 

My final score was:

Completed Turns (6): 60

Threat: 35.

VP: 4

Total Score: 91

GAME 203: JOURNEY DOWN THE ANDUIN


Deck: Mark II: http://community.fan...-my-solo-decks/ [/]


 


For this I decided to stick with the all-Silvan hero combo consisting of Celeborn, Haldir & Legolas. This gave me a threat of 29.


 


My starting hand was Defender of the Nalth, Feint, O Lorien, Silvan Tracker, Sneak Attack and The Tree People.


 


Quest set-up consisted of (luckily) adding a Hill Troll to the staging area.


 


Turn One began with me adding resources to my heroes before drawing Galadhon Archer.


 


During planning I paid 1 resource from Celeborn to play O Lorien on Celeborn before exhausting O Lorien and paying 1 resource each from Haldir and Legolas to play Defender of the Nalth I.


 


In the quest phase I committed Celeborn for 3 willpower. In addition to the 1 threat in the staging area I drew Despair, for no effect. I made 2 progress and added them to stage 1B.


 


At the end of the turn I refreshed my cards and increased my threat to 30.


 


Turn Two began with me adding a resource to my heroes before drawing Elven Mail.


 


In the planning stage I exhausted O Lorien before paying 1 resource from Legolas to play Galadhon Archer I, doing 1 damage to the Hill Troll.


 


During the quest phase I committed Celeborn for 3 willpower. In addition to the 1 threat in the staging area I drew Evil Storm, for no effect. I made 2 progress and added them to stage 1B.


 


After skipping the travel phase I was engaged by the Hill Troll, attacking Defender of the Nalth I, attacking him for 6, killing him and raising my threat to 32.


 


As a counter attack, Haldir, Legolas and the buffed Galadhon Archer I attacked for 9, doing 6 more damage to the Hill Troll.


 


I ended the turn by refreshing my cards before raising my threat to 33.


 


Turn Three began with me adding resources before drawing another The Tree People.


 


In the planning phase I exhausted O Lorien before paying 2 resources from Haldir to play Silvan Tracker I.


 


In the quest phase I committed Celeborn and the buffed Silvan Tracker I for a total of 5 willpower. With a empty staging area I drew Enchanted Stream for 2 threat. I made 3 progress, adding them to stage 1B.


 


After deciding not to travel I paid 1 resource from Legolas to play Feint on the Hill Troll before Haldir, Legolas and Galadhon Archer I attacked it for 8, killing it and sending it to the victory display before I added 2 progress (from Legolas) onto stage 1B, exploring it and moving to stage 2B.


 


To end the turn I refreshed all my cards before raising my threat to 34.


 


Turn Four began with me adding resources before drawing Heir of Mardil.


 


In the planning stage I played The Tree People, returning Galadhon Archer I to my hand and putting Rumil into play.


 


In the quest phase I committed Celeborn, Haldir and Silvan Tracker I for 6 willpower. In addition to the 2 threat already in play I drew Evil Storm, which had no effect and Necromancer's Pass for a total of 5 threat. 1 progress was placed on stage 2B.


 


I opted to travel to Necromancer's Pass, discarding Heir of Mardil & Sneak Attack.


 


At the end of the turn I refreshed my cards before raising my threat to 35.


 


I started Turn Five by adding resources before drawing Gandalf (Core).


 


Moving onto planning I exhausted O Lorien before paying 1 resource from Legolas to play Galadhon Archer I.


 


In the quest phase I committed Celeborn and Silvan Tracker before spending 1 resource from Celeborn to Sneak Attack in Gandalf and use his ability to lower my threat to 30. I then committed Gandalf for a total of 8 willpower.


 


In addition to the 2 threat in the staging area I drew The Necromancer's Reach (which added a wound to Celeborn, Silvan Tracker I and Gandalf) and Goblin Sniper for a total of 4 threat. 4 progress was made, 2 explored Necromancer's Pass and 2 were added to stage 2B. I then returned Gandalf to my hand.


 


After not travelling I used Haldir's special ability to (fittingly enough) snipe the Goblin Sniper and kill him


 


At the end of the turn I refreshed my cards, used Silvan Tracker to heal one wound from Celeborn and Silvan Tracker I before raising my threat to 31..


 


Turn Six started with me adding resources before I drew another Galadhon Archer.


 


During the planning phase I paid 3 resources from Celeborn and 1 resource each from Haldir and Legolas to play Gandalf, again using his special ability to drop my threat to 26.


 


During the quest phase I committed Celeborn, Silvan Tracker I and Gandalf for 8 willpower.


 


With 2 threat in the staging area I drew The Necromancer's Reach again, adding 1 damage to Celeborn, Silvan Tracker I and Gandalf, and Dol Goldur Beastmaster for a total of 4 threat. 4 progress was placed on stage 2B.


 


After travelling to the Enchanted Stream the Dol Goldur Beastmaster attacked Rumil. After both shadow cards did nothing Rumil was killed before Haldir and Legolas attacked and killed the Beastmaster, adding 2 progress to and exploring the Enchanted Stream.


 


I ended the turn by refeshing all my cards, healing Celeborn and Silvan Tracker, before raising my theat to 27 and discarding Gandalf.


 


Turn Seven began with me adding resources before I drew Defender of the Nalth.


 


During the planning phase I exhuasted O Lorien and paid 1 resource each from Celeborn and Haldir to play Defender of the Nalth I. I then paid 2 resources from Legolas to play Elven Mail on Defender of the Nalth I.


 


In the quest phase I committed Celeborn and Silvan Tracker I for a total of 4 willpower. With a empty staging area I drew Misty Mountain Goblins and The Brown Lands for a nasty 7 threat. My threat increased to 30.


 


I opted to move to the Brown Lands, which discarded it immediately before I optionally engaged the Misty Mountain Goblins. The Goblins's attack removed 1 progress from stage 2B before they attacked Defender of the Nalth I. Even with their attack buffed by a Dol Goldur Orcs shadow card no damage was inflicted before Haldir and Legolas attacked, killing the Misty Mountain Goblins and adding 2 progress to stage 2B.


 


I ended the turn by refreshing my cards and raising my threat to 31.


 


At the start of Turn Eight I added resources before I drew Rivendell Blade. I then paid 1 resource from Legolas to play the Rivendell Blade on Haldir.


 


In the quest phase I committed Celeborn and Silvan Tracker I for 4 willpower. With a empty staging area I drew Gladden Fields and Banks of the Anduin for 4 threat. No progress was made.


 


After travelling to Gladden Fields I ended the turn by refreshing my cards and raising my threat to 33.


 


To start Turn Nine I added resources before drawing Thror's Map.


 


I paid 1 resource from Haldir and played Thror's Map on Legolas before exhausting O Lorien and paying 1 resource from Legolas to play Galadhon Archer II.


 


Having emptied my hand I committed Celeborn, Haldir, Legolas, Silvan Tracker I and Galadhon Archer I for 8 willpower.


 


With 1 in the staging area I drew The East Bight and Marsh Adder for a total of 5 threat. 3 progress was enough to explore Gladden Fields and add it to the victory display.


 


After travelling to the East Bight I optionally engaged the Marsh Adder. It attacked Defender of the Nalth I, doing 2 damage and raising my threat to 34. in return Galadhon Atcher I attacked, doing 2 damage to the Marsh Adder.


 


At the end of the turn I refreshed my cards, healed 1 damage from Defender of the Nalth and raised my threat to 35.


 


Turn Ten began with me adding resources before I drew Gandalf (Core).


 


In planning I paid 4 resources from Celeborn and 1 from Haldir to play Gandalf. I then used his ability to drop my threat to 30.


 


During questing I committed Celeborn, Gandalf and Silvan Tracker for 8 willpower. With 1 threat in the staging area I drew Despair, which took 4 progress from stage 2B and Treacherous Fog, which boosted the threat total to 2. 6 progress was made, which explored the East Bight.


 


After travelling to Banks of the Anduin the Marsh Adder attacked Defender of the Nalth I. Unfortunately, the shadow card was Eastern Crows, which buffed Marsh Adder enough to kill the Defender of the Nalth. Haldir, Legolas and both Galadhon Archers then attacked for 10, killing the Marsh Adder and sending it to the victory display before adding 2 progress to Banks of the Anduin.


 


At the end of the turn I refreshed everything, discarded Gandalf and raised my threat to 31.


 


Turn Eleven started with me adding resources before drawing another Silvan Tracker. I then exhausted O Lorien before paying 2 resources from Haldir to play Silvan Tracker II.


 


In the quest phase I committed Celeborn and both Silvan Trackers for 7 willpower. With a empty staging area I drew Pursued By Shadows, which raised my threat to 35 and Banks of the Anduin for a total of 1 threat. 6 progress was made, 1 explored Banks of the Anduin and sent it to the top of the deck and 5 progress was added to stage 2B.


 


After travelling to the Banks of the Anduin, I ended the turn by refreshing everyone and raising my threat to 36.


 


Turn Twelve marked the turn where this went from a quest to a slog. It started with me adding resources before I drew Defender of the Nalth.


 


In the planning phase I paid 1 resource from all my heroes to pay for Defender of the Nalth I(a).


 


In the quest phase I committed Celeborn, Haldir, Legolas, both Silvan Trackers and Defender of the Nalth I for 9 willpower. With nothing in the staging area I drew Banks of the Anduin and The East Bight for 2 total threat. 7 progress was made, 4 blew through Banks of the Anduin and sent it back to the top of the deck and 3 was placed on stage 2B,


 


After travelling to the East Bight I ended the turn by refreshing all my cards and raising my threat to 37.


 


Turn Thirteen began with me adding resources before I drew Galadhrim Minstrel. I then exhausted O Lorien before paying 1 resource from Haldir to play Galadhrim Minstrel I. She allowed me to pull The Tree People, which I immediately played to return Galadhrim Minstrel I to my hand and pull Mirkwood Runner I into play. I then paid 2 resources from Haldir to play Galadhrim Minstrel back into play. I failed spectacularly to pull a event.


 


In the quest phase I committed Celeborn, both Silvan Trackers, Mirkwood Runner I and Galadhrim Minstrel I for a total of 9 willpower. In addition to the 1 threat in the staging area I drew Treacherous Fog, which buffs Banks of the Anduin and Eastern Crows, which surged to Driven By Shadow, which made a total of 5 threat. 4 progress was placed on East Bight.


 


The Eastern Crows attacked Haldir, whose useless shadow card was the other Hill Troll. No damage was done and Legolas hit back, killing the Eastern Crows and adding 2 progress to explore The East Bight.


 


At the end of the turn I refreshed my cards and raised my threat to 38.


 


As turn fourteen began I added resources before drawing Wingfoot, which I immediately paid 1 resource from Haldir to play on Haldir.


 


In the quest phase I committed Celeborn, Haldir (Naming “Enemy), Legolas, both Silvan Trackers and Galadhrim Minstrel I for a total of 9 willpower.


 


In addition to the 1 threat in the staging area I drew Necromancer's Pass and Pursued By Shadow, which raised my threat to 42. with a total threat of 4, 5 progress was made, enough to explore stage 2B.


 


Stage 3B told me to draw 2 cards, two copies of Gladden Fields. Since there was no enemies in play I finally won the game.


 


This was a complete slog of a quest. I'm going to be making changes to the deck to add more threat reduction and probably card play options (since I was only able to use the card I drew each turn for about 5 turns at the end).


 


In the end, my final score was:


Completed Turns (13): 130


Threat: 42


VP: 10


Total Score: 162.

GAME 204: HUNT FOR GOLLUM (I know I skipped a quest but I'm having to play with a deck I'm not experienced with building so playing with, arguably the toughest solo scenario in the game was a bad idea).

Deck: Mark III: http://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/133239-my-solo-decks/ [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/133239-my-solo-decks/]

 

For this I decided to try a all-Lore deck consisting of Elrond, Glorfindel and Mirlonde, which gave me a 30 starting threat.

 

For my starting hand I drew Asfaloth, Bombur, Cloak of Lorien, Elf-Stone, Gandalf (Core) and Master of Law.

 

To set up the quest I added Signs of Gollum, guarded by Gladden Fields to the staging area.

 

Turn One began with me adding resources before drawing another Asfaloth.

 

I then paid 1 resource from Elrond to play Elf-Stone on Gladden Fields/Signs of Gollum before paying 1 resource each from Glorfindel and Mirlonde to play Asfaloth on Glorfindel.

 

During the quest phase I committed Elrond for 3 willpower. In addition to the 3 threat in play I drew The Eaves of Mirkwood. I then exhausted Asfaloth to add 2 progress to the Eaves of Mirkwood and discard it leaving a total 3 threat in play. No progress was made.

 

After travelling to Gladden Fields/Signs of Gollum I ended the turn by refreshing my cards and raising my threat to 32.

 

Turn Two began with me adding resources before I drew Gleowine.

 

During planning I paid 1 resource each from all my heroes to play Bombur.

 

Moving onto questing I committed Elrond and Mirlonde for 5 willpower. With a empty staging area I drew Banks of the Anduin for 1 threat. 4 progress was made, 3 explored Gladden Fields, added it to the victory display and (thanks to Elf-Stone) allowed me to draw another Gandalf (Core) and Warden of Healing. I then attached Signs of Gollum to Elrond and added 1 progress to stage 1B before playing Treacherous Fog, which had no effect.

 

After travelling to Banks of the Anduin I exhausted Asfaloth to add 2 progress to it before ending the turn by refreshing my cards and raising my threat to 33.

 

Turn Three began with me adding resources before drawing Gildor Inglorion.

 

During planning I paid 1 resource from Elrond and Glorfindel to play Gleowine.

 

In the quest phase I committed Elrond and Mirlonde for 5 willpower. With a empty staging area I drew The Old Ford for 1 threat. 4 progress was made. 1 explored Banks of the Anduin and sent it back to the top of the encounter deck before 3 progress was added to stage 1B. I then selected to add Evil Storm into play which did nothing.

 

After travelling to The Old Ford I exhausted Asfaloth to add 2 progress to and explore The Old Ford before refreshing all my cards and raising my threat to 34.

 

Turn Four began with me adding resources before drawing another Master of Law. I proceeded to pay 1 resource from Elrond and Mirlonde to play Warden of Healing I.

 

Proceeding to questing I committed Elrond, Mirlonde and Warden of Healing I for 6 willpower. With a empty staging area I drew another Signs of Gollum which was guarded by a useless Treacherous Fog. With no threat in play I made 6 progress, more than enough to complete stage 1B and move onto stage 2B.

 

After adding Signs of Gollum to Glorfindel I refreshed all my cards before raising my threat to 35.

 

Turn Five began with me adding resources before I drew Erebor Hammersmith. I then paid 1 resource each from Elrond and Mirlonde to play Erebor Hammersmith I, who returned the Elf-Stone from my discard pile to my hand.

 

During questing I added Gladden Fields to the staging area before committing Elrond, Mirlonde, Warden of Healing I and Erebor Hammersmith I for 7 willpower.

 

With 3 threat in the staging area I drew The Eaves of Mirkwood. I then exhausted Asfaloth to add 2 progress to and explore The Eaves of Mirkwood leaving a total of 3 threat. 4 progress was added to stage 2B.

 

After travelling to Gladden Fields I refreshed everything and raised my threat to 37.

 

Turn Six began again with me adding resources before drawing Self-Preservation. I then paid 1 resource each from Elrond and Mirlonde and 3 resources from Glorfindel to play Gildor Inglorion. I then paid 1 resource from Mirlonde to play Cloak of Lorien on Gildor Inglorion.

 

During questing I added played Flooded which raised my threat to 38 and surged to Pursued By Shadow which raised my threat to 41 before I committed Elrond, Mirlonde, Warden of Healing I and Erebor Hammersmith I for 7 willpower. With a empty staging area I drew Eastern Crows for 1 threat. I then exhausted Asfaloth to add 2 progress to Gladden Fields. Of the 6 progress made, 1 explored Gladden Fields and 5 was added to stage 2B.

 

The Eastern Crows attacked Bombur, doing no damage before Glorfindel killed the Eastern Crows and shuffled them back into the encounter deck. I ended the turn by refreshing my cards before I raised my threat to 42.

 

As I wished I had played Gandalf instead of Gildor I started Turn Seven by adding resources and drawing another Warden of Healing.

 

After skipping planning I added Banks of the Anduin to the staging area before committing Elrond and Mirlonde for 5 willpower. With 1 threat in the staging area I drew The Eaves of Mordor for 3 total threat. The 3 progress I made explored stage 2B and I qualified for stage 3B.

 

After exhausting Asfaloth and exploring Eaves of Mirkwood I travelled to Banks of the Anduin before ending the turn and raising my threat to 43.

 

Turn Eight began with me adding resources and drawing Henamarth Riversong. I then paid all the resources on my heroes to play Gandalf (dropping my threat to 38) and Henamarth Riversong. I then exhausted Asfaloth to put 2 progress on Banks of the Anduin.

 

Going into questing I added Eastern Crows to the staging area before committing everyone for 18 willpower. In addition to the 1 threat in the staging area I drew False Lead, which removed one of the Signs of Gollum's but meant that I made 17 progress and after exploring Banks of the Anduin made 16 progress on stage 3B, completing the quest.

 

As far as the new deck went, the whole thing went better than I thought it would. I managed to get 3 Hunters from Mordor as part of a 'pick one' option. Several killed Eastern Crows made it so that I dodged all the Hunters. I think I'll keep going and see how the heroes do against trolls next game.

 

:

 

For this I decided to try a all-Lore deck consisting of Elrond, Glorfindel and Mirlonde, which gave me a 30 starting threat.

 

For my starting hand I drew Asfaloth, Bombur, Cloak of Lorien, Elf-Stone, Gandalf (Core) and Master of Law.

 

To set up the quest I added Signs of Gollum, guarded by Gladden Fields to the staging area.

 

Turn One began with me adding resources before drawing another Asfaloth.

 

I then paid 1 resource from Elrond to play Elf-Stone on Gladden Fields/Signs of Gollum before paying 1 resource each from Glorfindel and Mirlonde to play Asfaloth on Glorfindel.

 

During the quest phase I committed Elrond for 3 willpower. In addition to the 3 threat in play I drew The Eaves of Mirkwood. I then exhausted Asfaloth to add 2 progress to the Eaves of Mirkwood and discard it leaving a total 3 threat in play. No progress was made.

 

After travelling to Gladden Fields/Signs of Gollum I ended the turn by refreshing my cards and raising my threat to 32.

 

Turn Two began with me adding resources before I drew Gleowine.

 

During planning I paid 1 resource each from all my heroes to play Bombur.

 

Moving onto questing I committed Elrond and Mirlonde for 5 willpower. With a empty staging area I drew Banks of the Anduin for 1 threat. 4 progress was made, 3 explored Gladden Fields, added it to the victory display and (thanks to Elf-Stone) allowed me to draw another Gandalf (Core) and Warden of Healing. I then attached Signs of Gollum to Elrond and added 1 progress to stage 1B before playing Treacherous Fog, which had no effect.

 

After travelling to Banks of the Anduin I exhausted Asfaloth to add 2 progress to it before ending the turn by refreshing my cards and raising my threat to 33.

 

Turn Three began with me adding resources before drawing Gildor Inglorion.

 

During planning I paid 1 resource from Elrond and Glorfindel to play Gleowine.

 

In the quest phase I committed Elrond and Mirlonde for 5 willpower. With a empty staging area I drew The Old Ford for 1 threat. 4 progress was made. 1 explored Banks of the Anduin and sent it back to the top of the encounter deck before 3 progress was added to stage 1B. I then selected to add Evil Storm into play which did nothing.

 

After travelling to The Old Ford I exhausted Asfaloth to add 2 progress to and explore The Old Ford before refreshing all my cards and raising my threat to 34.

 

Turn Four began with me adding resources before drawing another Master of Law. I proceeded to pay 1 resource from Elrond and Mirlonde to play Warden of Healing I.

 

Proceeding to questing I committed Elrond, Mirlonde and Warden of Healing I for 6 willpower. With a empty staging area I drew another Signs of Gollum which was guarded by a useless Treacherous Fog. With no threat in play I made 6 progress, more than enough to complete stage 1B and move onto stage 2B.

 

After adding Signs of Gollum to Glorfindel I refreshed all my cards before raising my threat to 35.

 

Turn Five began with me adding resources before I drew Erebor Hammersmith. I then paid 1 resource each from Elrond and Mirlonde to play Erebor Hammersmith I, who returned the Elf-Stone from my discard pile to my hand.

 

During questing I added Gladden Fields to the staging area before committing Elrond, Mirlonde, Warden of Healing I and Erebor Hammersmith I for 7 willpower.

 

With 3 threat in the staging area I drew The Eaves of Mirkwood. I then exhausted Asfaloth to add 2 progress to and explore The Eaves of Mirkwood leaving a total of 3 threat. 4 progress was added to stage 2B.

 

After travelling to Gladden Fields I refreshed everything and raised my threat to 37.

 

Turn Six began again with me adding resources before drawing Self-Preservation. I then paid 1 resource each from Elrond and Mirlonde and 3 resources from Glorfindel to play Gildor Inglorion. I then paid 1 resource from Mirlonde to play Cloak of Lorien on Gildor Inglorion.

 

During questing I added played Flooded which raised my threat to 38 and surged to Pursued By Shadow which raised my threat to 41 before I committed Elrond, Mirlonde, Warden of Healing I and Erebor Hammersmith I for 7 willpower. With a empty staging area I drew Eastern Crows for 1 threat. I then exhausted Asfaloth to add 2 progress to Gladden Fields. Of the 6 progress made, 1 explored Gladden Fields and 5 was added to stage 2B.

 

The Eastern Crows attacked Bombur, doing no damage before Glorfindel killed the Eastern Crows and shuffled them back into the encounter deck. I ended the turn by refreshing my cards before I raised my threat to 42.

 

As I wished I had played Gandalf instead of Gildor I started Turn Seven by adding resources and drawing another Warden of Healing.

 

After skipping planning I added Banks of the Anduin to the staging area before committing Elrond and Mirlonde for 5 willpower. With 1 threat in the staging area I drew The Eaves of Mordor for 3 total threat. The 3 progress I made explored stage 2B and I qualified for stage 3B.

 

After exhausting Asfaloth and exploring Eaves of Mirkwood I travelled to Banks of the Anduin before ending the turn and raising my threat to 43.

 

Turn Eight began with me adding resources and drawing Henamarth Riversong. I then paid all the resources on my heroes to play Gandalf (dropping my threat to 38) and Henamarth Riversong. I then exhausted Asfaloth to put 2 progress on Banks of the Anduin.

 

Going into questing I added Eastern Crows to the staging area before committing everyone for 18 willpower. In addition to the 1 threat in the staging area I drew False Lead, which removed one of the Signs of Gollum's but meant that I made 17 progress and after exploring Banks of the Anduin made 16 progress on stage 3B, completing the quest.

 

As far as the new deck went, the whole thing went better than I thought it would. I managed to get 3 Hunters from Mordor as part of a 'pick one' option. Several killed Eastern Crows made it so that I dodged all the Hunters. I think I'll keep going and see how the heroes do against trolls next game.

This went badly. This deck is too reliant on certain cards early on so I may have to go back to the drawing board and either try something completely different.

You have made a mistake at turn three :

 

> Play The Tree People, put Galadhrim Minstrel back into hand and add Galadhon Archer I into play.
> 
> Galadhon Archer I does 1 damage to Hill Troll, killing it and adding it to the victory display.

 

Galadhon Archer does 1 damage to an ennemy not engage with you.

Darn it. I suppose it's karma that the game went south just after that (I should have guessed that i had erred somewhere when I hit five successive surge cards).

## 258 [silverthorn on February 8, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1440483)

GAME 205: JOURNEY DOWN THE ANDUIN (NIGHTMARE) – ATTEMPT TWO

Deck: Mark V:

 

After the last game ended badly I decided to try something different. I made up the decks from the 'The Woodland Realms Unite' articles.

 

The one major difference was that deck 2 has a Black Arrow instead of one of the Henamarth Riversong cards.

 

Deck 1 is 'The Elven Highborn', consisting of Celeborn, Elrond & Galadriel. This gave me a somewhat high 33 threat. The starting hand was A Test Of Will, Feigned Voices, Gandalf (Core), Lorien Guide, Nalth Guide and Silvan Refugee.

 

Since there was no O Lorien in the hand I decided to mulligan, drawing Defender of the Nalth x2, Nalth Guide, Nenya, O Lorien and Sneak Attack.

 

Deck 2 was 'The Spear Of Mirkwood', consisting of Haldir of Lorien, Legolas and Mirlonde. The starting threat was a lot lower 24. The starting hand was Elven Mail, Galadhon Archer, Mirkwood Runner, Pursuing the Enemy, Silvan Tracker and Unseen Strike.

 

I decided to mulligan, drawing Black Arrow, Daughter of the Nimrodel, Feint, Foe-Hammer, Pursuing The Enemy and Unseen Strike.

 

For quest set-up I added The East Bight and Pursuit On The Shore, which surged to Smoking Blood, which then surged to The Necromancer's Reach, which did nothing. I ended set-up by adding a Hill Troll to the staging area.

 

Turn One began with me adding resources to all the heroes before deck 1 drew Hasty Stroke and Deck 2 drew Mirkwood Runner.

 

During planning deck 1 paid 1 resource from Celeborn to play O Lorien before exhausting O Lorien and removing a resource each from Elrond and Galadriel to play Defender of the Nalth I. Deck 2 played Black Arrow on Legolas.

 

During the planning phase Celeborn, Elrond and Defender of the Nalth I committed. In addition to the 2 threat in the staging area I drew Goblin Sniper and another The Necromancer's Reach, which did 1 damage to Celeborn and Elrond. This made for a total of 7 willpower against 3 threat. 4 progress was added to stage 1B before I travelled to the East Bight.

 

During the encounter phase deck 1 engaged the Hill Troll before I paid 1 resource from Legolas to play Feint on the Hill Troll, stopping it's attack. In response, Haldir and Legolas (using the Black Arrow and sending it to the victory display) used Unseen Strike to push the total attack to 14 and kill the Hill Troll, send it to the victory display and add 2 progress to the active The East Bight. I then exhausted Galadriel to drop deck 1's threat to 32 and allow Deck 1 to draw Feigned Voices.

 

After all that I added 1 damage to Celeborn  and Legolas from Goblin Sniper before I refreshed all the cards and raised deck 1's threat to 33 and deck 2's to 25. 

 

Turn Two began with deck 2 becoming first player before I added resources and deck 1 drew Silvan Refugee and deck 2 drew Hands Upon The Bow.

 

During planning deck 2 paid 1 resource from Haldir and 2 from Mirlonde to play Mirkwood Runner I. Deck 1 paid 1 resource from  Galadriel to play Nenya on her. I then exhausted O Lorien before paying 1 resource each from Celeborn and Elrond to play Defender of the Nalth II.

 

Proceeding to questing I committed Celeborn, Elrond Mirlonde and Defender of the Nalth II before exhausting Galadriel and Nenya to add her willpower to Elrond's.

 

In addition to the 2 threat in the staging area I drew Anduin Troll Spawn, which surged to another The Necromancer's Reach (which added 1 damage to Celeborn, Elrond and Galadriel) and another East Bight. This made for a total of 11 willpower against. 5 threat. 6 progress was made, 4 explored the active The East Bight and 2 was added to stage 1B.

 

After travelling to The East Bight the Anduin Troll Spawn attacked Defender of the Nalth I. The shadow card was Smoking Blood, which luckily had no effect although the attack killed the Defender of the Nalth. In response Haldir, Legolas and Defender of the Nalth II attacked for 8 (thanks to the buff Celeborn provided to Defender of the Nalth II), killing the Anduin Troll Spawn.

 

At the end of the turn I added a wound to the Mirkwood Runner and Galadriel from the Goblin Sniper before I refreshed all the cards and raised Deck 2's threat to 26 and Deck 1's threat to 34.

 

Turn Three began with making deck 1 first player and adding resources before deck 1 drew another Defender of the Nalth and deck 2 drew Daughter of the Nimrodel.

 

Planning began with deck 1 paying 1 resource each from Celeborn and Elrond to play Nalth Guide I, which allows Celeborn to quest without exhausting (which will be handy if there's another flaming The Necromancer's Reach in the deck). I then paid 1 resource from Galadriel to play Silvan Refugee I and exhausted O Lorien. Deck 2 paid 1 resource from Haldir and  Mirlonde to play Daughter of the Nimrodel I, then immediately exhausted her to take 2 damage off Celeborn.

 

During questing I committed Celeborn, Elrond, Nalth Guide I, Silvan Refugee I and exhausted Galadriel and Nenya to add her willpower to Elrond. In addition to the 2 points in the staging area I drew The Brown Lands and Troll Attack, which surged to Chieftain Ufthak. This made for a impressive 15 willpower against 9 threat. 6 progress was made, exploring The East Bight.

 

After travelling to the Brown Lands and automatically exploring it before Chieftain Ufthak attacked Silvan Refugee I. The shadow card was Gladden Marshlands which fortunately added 1 to Chieftain's attack (I would much rather have that come up as a shadow card than come up as a encounter card with it's 10 threat). The buffed attack kills Silvan Refugee I before Haldir, Legolas and (of all people) Nalth Guide I attack for 8 and inflict 5 damage.

 

At the end of the turn I add a wound to Celeborn and Mirlonde from Goblin Sniper before refreshing the cards and raising deck 1's threat to 35 and deck 2's threat to 27.

 

Turn Four began with making deck 2 the first player before adding resources. Deck 2 then drew The Tree People before deck 1 drew Elrond's Counsel.

 

During planning deck 2 played The Tree People, sending Mirkwood Runner back to the hand before playing Galadhon Archer I, who does 1 damage to Chieftain Ufthak, killing him and adding him to the victory display. Deck 1 then exhausted O Lorien so that I could pay 1 resource each from Haldir and Mirlonde to play Daughter of the Nimrodel II. I then immediately exhausted both Daughters to heal 2 wounds each from Elrond and Celeborn.

 

Proceeding to questing I committed Celeborn, Elrond, Nalth Guide I and Mirlonde before exhausting Galadriel and Nenya to buff Elrond. Deck 1 played Elrond's Counsel to buff Celeborn's willpower and drop deck 1's threat to 32. In addition to the 2 threat in the staging area I drew Marshland Outlaws and Gladden Fields. This made for a total of 13 willpower against 7 threat. The 6 progress made was more than enough to explore stage 1B and proceed to stage 2B.

 

After travelling to Gladden Fields the Marshland Outlaws performs a undefended attack on Elrond. The shadow card was Anduin Troll Spawn for no effect and the attack did 2 damage. In response, Elrond, Haldir, Legolas and Galadhon Archer I attacked for 12, killing the Marshland Outlaws and adding 2 progress to Gladden Fields.

 

At the end of the turn, Celeborn and Legolas took a wound from Goblin Sniper before I refreshed all my cards and raised deck 1's threat to 34 and deck 2's to 29.

 

Turn Five began with deck 1 becoming first player before I added resources and deck 1 drew Galadhrim Minstrel and deck 2 drew Rivendell Blade.

 

During planning deck 1 exhausted O Lorien before paying 1 resource from Elrond to play Galadhrim Minstrel I before pulling Elrond's Counsel into the hand. Deck 2 paid a resource from Legolas to play Rivendell Blade on Legolas. I then paid 2 resources from Haldir and 1 from Mirlonde to play Mirkwood Runner I.

 

During questing I committed Elrond, Celeborn, Haldir, Mirlonde, Nalth Guide I, Galadhrim Minstrel and Mirkwood Runner I before exhausting Galadriel and Nenya to buff Elrond. Deck 1 played Elrond's Counsel on Elrond to buff Celeborn and drop deck 1's threat to 31. In addition to the 2 threat in the staging area I drew Brown Water Rats, another Brown Water Rats and Pursued By Shadows which raised deck 1's threat to 33 and deck 2's threat to 33. This made for a total of 19 willpower against 4 threat. 15 progress was made, 1 progress explored Gladden Fields and sent it to the victory display before 14 progress was added to stage 2B. Having finally checked what Hands Upon The Bow does I paid 1 resource from Legolas to play it and target the Goblin Sniper in the staging area. The 6 attack killed the Goblin Sniper, adding 2 progress to stage 2B and exploring it. 

 

Stage 3B forced me to draw 2 A Flooded Fords, Gladden Marshlands and Gladden Fields. Since both of the enemies in play have the Rat trait they discarded themselves and I won the quest.

 

The final combined score was:

Completed Turns (4): 40

Combined Threat: 66.

Damage on surviving heroes: 7

VP: 12

Total Score: 101.

 

these decks seemed to work well although the fact that a lot of the cards are ones I never use made this a learning experience (I had forgotten that you can snipe out of combat with Hands Upon The Bow until turn 5. I could have used it to get rid of the pesky Goblin Sniper).

 

I'm definitely going to keep these two decks since playing cards I don't use is a attraction after this much gaming.

GAME 206: ESCAPE FROM DOL GOLDUR (NIGHTMARE)

Deck: Mark V:

 

I decided to stick with the same Decks I played through Journey Down The Anduin with.

 

Deck A is 'The Elven Highborn', consisting of Celeborn, Elrond & Galadriel. This gave me a somewhat high 33 threat. The starting hand was Defender of the Nalth, Feigned Voices, Light Of Valinor, O Lorien, Silverlode Archer and Sneak Attack.

 

Deck B was 'The Spear Of Mirkwood', consisting of Haldir of Lorien, Legolas and Mirlonde. The starting threat was a lot lower 24. The starting hand was Mirkwood Runner, Ranger Spikes, Rivendell Blade, Rivendell Bow x2 and Unseen Strike.

 

For quest set-up I added the objectives: Dungeon Torch guarded by Hummerhorns, Gandalf's Map guarded by The Necromancer's Reach (which luckily discards after doing nothing) and Shadow Key guarded by Dungeon Jailer.

 

Stage 1B forced me to select a random hero to be the captive. I randomly selected Mirlonde for that 'honour'.

 

Turn One began with me adding resources (Celeborn: 1, Elrond: 1, Galadriel: 1, Haldir: 1, Legolas: 1), before Deck A drew Nalth Guide and Deck B drew Pursuing The Enemy.

 

During planning Deck A played O Lorien on Celeborn (Celeborn: 0), exhausted O Lorien and played Defender of the Nalth I (Elrond: 0, Galadriel: 0). Deck B played Rivendell Blade on Legolas (Legolas: 0).

 

During the quest phase Deck A committed Celeborn, Elrond and Defender of the Nalth I. In addition to the 2 threat in play I drew Great Forest Web and Dungeon Labyrinth. This made for a total of 7 willpower against 5 threat, 2 progress was duly added to stage 1B.

 

After travelling to Dungeon Labyrinth. The Dungeon Jailer attacked Deck A, targeting Defender of the Nalth I. The shadow card was Spider of Dol Goldur who added 3 attack for a total of 5 attack. This was enough to kill Defender of the Nalth I. Haldir and Legolas then attacked it, doing 5 damage, thanks to the Rivendell Blade on Legolas, and killed the Dungeon Jailer, sending him to the victory display and adding 2 progress to Dungeon Labyrinth. Deck A then added Shadow Key to Galadriel and raised their threat to 35. I then exhausted Galadriel to drop Deck A's threat to 34 and draw Nenya.

 

At the end of the round I added 2 resources to Dungeon Labyrinth and added a wound to Galadriel before refreshing all the cards and raising Deck A's threat to 35 and Deck B's threat to 25.

 

Turn Two began with me adding resources (Celeborn: 1, Elrond: 1, Galadriel: 1, Haldir: 2, Legolas: 1) before Deck B drew Daughter of the Nimrodel and Deck A drew Mirror Of Galadriel. Deck A then exhausted O Lorien.

 

During planning Deck B played Daughter of the Nimrodel (Haldir: 0). Deck A played Mirror Of Galadriel (Galadriel: -1) before exhausting it to pull Arwen Undomiel into my hand before discarding Sneak Attack. Deck A then played Nenya on Galadriel (Celeborn: 0).

 

In the quest phase Deck A committed Celeborn before Galadriel and Nenya exhausted to buff him. In addition to the 2 threat in the staging area I drew Driven By Shadow and Dol Goldur Beastmaster. This made for a total of 7 willpower against 6 threat. 1 more progress was added to Dungeon Labyrinth.

 

After skipping travel the Dol Goldur Beastmaster attacked Elrond. The shadow cards were Torture Chamber and Endless Caverns which had no effect so the attack did no damage. Haldir and Legolas then attacked the Dol Goldur Beastmaster for 6, killing it and adding 2 more progress to Dungeon Labyrinth.

 

At the end of the turn I added a wound to Galadriel and added 2 resources to Dungeon Labyrinth before refreshing all my cards and raising Deck A's threat to 36 and Deck B's threat to 26. I then exhausted Daughter of the Nimrodel I to heal the 2 damage on Galadriel.

 

Turn Three began with me making Deck A the first player and adding resources (Celeborn: 1, Elrond: 2, Galadriel: 1, Haldir: 1, Legolas: 2) before Deck A drew Feigned Voices and Deck B drew Silvan Tracker.

 

During planning Deck A exhausted O Lorien before playing Arwen Undomiel (Galadriel: 0) before I exhausted Mirror of Galadriel to pull Defender of the Nalth into my hand and discard Feigned Voices. They then played Defender of the Nalth I (Celeborn: 0, Elrond: 0).

 

During planning Deck A committed Arwen Undomiel, Defender of the Nalth I, Celeborn and Elrond before exhausting Galadriel to add her willpower to Celeborn's. 

 

In addition to the 3 threat in play I drew Sentinel of Shadow and Torture Chamber. This made for a total of 14 willpower against 10 threat. 4 progress was made, 3 finally explored Dungeon Labyrinth and 1 was placed on stage 1B.

 

After travelling to Torture Chamber Haldir used his ability to attack the Hummerhorns in the staging area, killing them and sending them to the victory display.

 

At the end of the turn I added a resource to Torture Chamber and a wound to Galadriel before refreshing my cards and raising Deck A's threat to 37 and Deck B's to 27.

 

Turn Four began with me making Deck B first player and adding resources (Celeborn: 1, Elrond: 1, Haldir: 2, Legolas: 3) before Deck B drew Hands Upon The Bow and Deck A drew another Arwen Undomiel. Deck A then exhausted Mirror of Galadriel to pull Nalth Guide from the Deck and discarded Silverlode Archer before exhausting O Lorien.

 

During planning Deck B played Silvan Tracker I (Haldir: 0) before Deck A played Light of Valinor on Elrond (Galadriel: 0) and Nalth Guide I (Celeborn: 0, Elrond: 0) meaning that Haldir could quest without exhausting this turn.

 

During the quest phase Deck B committed Haldir and Silvan Tracker I and Deck A committed Celeborn, Elrond, Arwen (adding her buff to Defender of the Nalth I) and Nalth Guide I before Galadriel & Nenya exhausted to add her willpower to Celeborn's. In addition to the 2 threat in the staging area I drew Chieftain Ufthak and another Dungeon Labyrinth. This made for a total of 18 willpower against 5 threat. 13 progress was made, 6 explored Torture Chamber and the last 7 explored stage 1B and allowed me to proceed to stage 2B.

 

After skipping travel for tactical reasons Chieftain Ufthak attacked Defender of the Nalth I. The shadow card was Necromancer's Pass, which did nothing and the attack did no damage thanks to the buff provided by Arwen. Haldir, Legolas and Elrond then attacked Chieftain Ufthak for 8, killing him thanks to Legolas's Rivendell Blade and sending him to the victory display before adding 2 progress to stage 2B, which released Mirlonde with a wound on her. This also added Nazgul of Dol Goldur to the staging area.

 

With the job half-done I ended the turn by adding a wound to Galadriel before I refreshed all my cards, healing the wound on Mirlonde thanks to Silvan Tracker I's ability. I then raised Deck B's threat to 28 and Deck A's to 38. Deck B finally exhausted Daughter of the Nimrodel I to heal the damage on Galadriel.

 

Turn Five began with Deck A becoming first player before I added resources (Celeborn: 1, Elrond: 1, Galadriel: 1, Haldir: 1, Legolas: 4, Mirlonde: 1) and Deck A drew Children of the Sea and Deck B drew The Tree People. Deck A then exhausted Mirror Of Galadriel to pull Galadhrim Minstrel into hand and discard Feigned Voices.

 

In planning Deck A played Nalth Guide II (Celeborn: 0, Elrond: 0) which allowed Haldir to quest this turn without exhausting. I then exhausted O Lorien. Deck B Played Mirkwood Runner I (Haldir: 0, Mirlonde: 0) before playing The Tree People, returning Mirkwood Runner I to the hand and put Rumil into play (unfortunately, I couldn't use his ability but he was the only Silvan ally in the top 5 cards) as well as playing Rivendell Bow on Mirlonde (Legolas: 3).

 

During the quest phase Deck A committed Celeborn, Elrond, Arwen Undomiel (buffing Defender of the Nalth I) and both Nalth Guides before Galadriel and Nenya exhausted to buff Celeborn. Deck B committed Haldir and Silvan Tracker I. In addition to the 8 threat in the staging area I drew Dol| Goldur Orcs, which added 2 wounds to Celeborn, and Eyes Of The Forest, which forced Deck A to discard Children of the Sea and Deck B to discard Unseen Strike, Hands Upon The Bow and Pursuing The Enemy. All in all 18 willpower went up against 12 threat. 6 progress was made and added to stage 2B.

 

After travelling to Dungeon Labyrinth Deck A engaged the Dol Goldur Orcs and the Nazgul of Dol Goldur. 

 

The Nazgul of Dol Goldur attacked Defender of the Nalth I, killing him and the Dol Goldur Orcs attacked Nalth Guide II, killing her.

 

In response, Elrond attacked and killed the Dol Goldur Orcs and Haldir, Legolas, Mirlonde and Rumil attacked the Nazgul of Dol Goldur, doing 9 damage (again thanks to the massively useful Rivendell Blade) and killed the Nazgul with a barrage of Ranged attacks.

 

At the end of the round I added 2 resources to Dungeon Labyrinth and a wound to Galadriel before refreshing all the cards. The 2 wounds on Celeborn were healed thanks to Silvan Tracker I before I raised Deck A's threat to 39 and Deck B's to 29. at this point I played Dungeon Torch and Gandalf's Map to Galadriel, raising Deck A's threat to 43.

 

Turn Six began with Deck B becoming first player. I then added resources (Celeborn: 1, Elrond: 1, Galadriel: 2, Haldir: 1, Legolas: 4, Mirlonde: 1).  Deck B proceeded to draw Foe-Hammer and Deck A drew Defender of the Nalth. Deck A then exhausted Mirror Of Galadriel to pull The Tree People into hand and discard Galadhrim Minstrel.

 

Planning began with Deck B playing Ranger Spikes into the staging area (Haldir: 0, Mirlonde: 0). Deck A played the Tree People, returning Nalth Guide I to the hand before playing Galadriel's Handmaiden I, who dropped Deck A's threat to 42. Deck A then exhausted O Lorien to play Nalth Guide I (Celeborn: 0) which allowed Haldir to quest without exhausting that turn before playing Defender of the Nalth I (Elrond: 0, Galadriel: 0). 

 

During questing Deck B committed Haldir, Mirlonde, Rumil and Silvan Tracker I while Deck A committed Celeborn, Elrond, Arwen (buffing Defender of the Nalth I), Galadriel's Handmaiden I, Nalth Guide I and Defender of the Nalth I before Galadriel and Nenya exhausted to buff Celeborn. In addition to the 2 threat in play I drew King Spider (which exhausted Galadriel's Handmaiden and Daughter of the Nimrodel but was caught on the Ranger Spikes) and Endless Caverns (which raised Deck A's threat back to 43 and Deck B's to 30) and surged to Sentinel of Shadow. This made for 21 willpower against 6 threat. 15 progress was made, 8 explored Dungeon Labyrinth and 7 explored stage 2B.

 

After travelling to Endless Caverns Haldir used his ability to attack the King Spider, doing 2 damage before I ended the turn by adding a wound to Galadriel before refreshing my cards, healing the wounds on Celeborn and raising Deck A's threat to 46 and Deck B's to 31. I then exhausted Daughter of the Nimrodel I to heal the wounds on Galadriel.

 

Turn Seven began with me making Deck A first player and adding resources (Celeborn: 1, Elrond: 1, Galadriel: 1, Haldir: 1, Legolas; 5, Mirlonde: 1) before Deck A drew Elrond's Counsel and Deck B drew another Rivendell Blade.

 

During planning Deck B played Rivendell Blade on Haldir (Legolas: 4).

 

In the quest phase I added a Orc Guard to each deck before Deck A committed Celeborn, Elrond, Arwen (buffing Defender of the Nalth I), |Galadriel's Handmaiden I and Nalth Guide I before Galadriel and Nenya exhausted to buff Celeborn and I played Elrond's Counsel to buff Celeborn and drop deck A's threat back to 43. Deck B committed Silvan Tracker I, Rumil, Mirlonde and Haldir. In addition to the 2 threat in play I drew Dol Goldur Beastmaster and Cavern Guardian, who increased Deck A's threat to 44 and Deck B's threat to 32. This made it that I had a total of 22 willpower against 6 threat. 16 progress was made, enough to explore Endless Caverns and stage 3B and win the game.

 

This was a odd game, Deck A seems to work remarkably well but Deck B seemed to not draw a lot of the cards I expected to need. EFDG is a lot different quest in nightmare mode and I suspect I hit lucky with encounter card draw.

 

My final score was:

Completed Turns (5): 50

Combined Threat: 76.

Damage: 0

VP: 14

Total Score: 112

Shadow: Troll Lair, no effect.


Attack kills Galadhon Archer. Deck 2 threat: 38.


Haldir, Legolas and Mirlonde attack Louis, killing it and adding 2 progress to The Carrock.


 


At this point I decided to call it quits. With deck 1 decimated and deck 2 about to be staring down 5 Trolls the odds of my completing the quest were non-existent. After 3 tries I'm starting to think that this nightmare quest is next to impossible with the decks I'm using. Since I like the decks I'm more likely to jump to the next quest rather than dump the decks I'm using.

My friends and I are struggling to get through the normal version of Conflict at the Carrock in 3-player games, so no surprise that the Nightmare scenario would be a challenge.

Conflict At The Carrock can be an absolute monster (well, four or five of them). It's one of those quests where I had serious trouble playing it solo in normal mode with a optimised deck. Nightmare mode just wound up vexing me most severely (since I doubt the sweary-blockers on here would let me express my true feelings).

GAME 211: INTO THE PIT

Deck: Mark 6

I decided to go back to playing solo since it's more of a challenge than two-handed. In addition I decided to skip the Shadows of Mirkwood cycle since I'm sick to my back teeth of SoM. As a result, I've jumped to the Khazad-Dum boxed set missions.

After playing Flight From Moria three times I'm having no luck with my current deck (I've also failed for different reasons each time so I suspect it's more the deck than anything else). I'm going back to the drawing board and working on something else.

## 272 [silverthorn on February 23, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1461443)

GAME: FLIGHT FROM MORIA

Heroes: Bifur, Dain Ironfoot and Gloin.

 

This deck worked although I lost a lot of allies. Dori was handy to take a 11 attack attack from A Foe Beyond. Bifur is ridiculously handy after I got a Navi's Belt on him. Unfortunately, due to a error on my part the write-up was deleted.

I've given SHadow & Flame six tries with three different decks and have come to the conclusion that it is impossible to beat it solo. I'm going to skip it and head on to Massing At Osgiliath before trying the nightmare Heirs of Numenor quests.

I make 15 progress on Buckleberry Ferry, exploring it and winning the quest.


 


This was a slog. Everybody did what they needed to (even though Wingfoot is of less use until I give Glorfindel the Ranger thingee) but I think I may need more card draw if I can fit it into the deck.


 


In the end my score was:


Completed turns (7): 70


Threat: 29


Hero Damage: 1


VP: 1


Total Score: 99

Total Threat: 6.


13 progress is added to Buckleberry Ferry, exploring it and winning the game.


 


This deck is brutally effective. The combination of being buffed by Celeborn and not exhausting to quest on the first turn thanks to Galadriel is a ridiculous combination. I could have possibly completed the game earlier but I took my time building up the Elven horde before I decided to fight the first Black Rider.


 


At the end of the game I decided to add Gandalf's Delay and Mr. Underhill to the campaign log.


 


My final score was:


Completed turns (7): 70.


Threat: 35.


VP: 4.


Total Score: 101.

GAME: PERIL IN PELARGIR (NIGHTMARE)

 

After 6 spectacular failures at The Old Forest I decided to try a different quest and a different deck. I went for a Rohan deck consisting of Eomer, Eowyn and Hama.

 

The game felt like less of a slog than the amount of turns would suggest but I hit a insane amount of locations, which slowed down my progress while enemies were little threat. Lots of allies died (as intended) to buff Eomer and the somewhat thematically inappropriate idea of Eomer having Firefoot and Rohan Warhorse worked well.

 

My final score was:
Completed Turns (11): 110

Threat: 34

VP: 3

Total Score: 141

## 282 [silverthorn on March 19, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1497653)

GAME: INTO ITHILIEN (NIGHTMARE) ATTEMPTS ONE AND TWO

Heroes; Eomer, Eowyn and Hama.

This went badly.  On the first attempt I was swamped by locations and on the second try I was swamped by enemies. In both cases I didn't manage to get past stage 1. I suspect that I may have to go back to basics with a new deck before I try this again.

## 283 [silverthorn on March 20, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1498730)

I just realized after looking back at the thread that yesterday was 1 one year on from me starting this. I'll probably keep noting my progress (or lack of such) since this has been fun. I managed 231 games in a year (with all the delays/interruptions) so I guess I managed what I was planning.

## 284 [silverthorn on March 22, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1501353)

GAME: INTO ITHILIEN (ATTEMPT THREE)

Heroes: Bifur, Dain Ironfoot and Gimli.

Whilst it was a succesful attempt, this was a bloodbath. All the Mumaks wreaked havoc and I managed to get Gimli killed on the last turn.

 

In the end my final score was:

Completed Turns (12): 120

Threat: 48

Dead Hero Threat: 11

Damage on surviving heroes: 7

FInal Score: 186

## 285 [silverthorn on March 25, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1506254)

GAME: SIEGE OF CAIR ANDROS - NIGHTMARE (ATTEMPTS ONE THROUGH SIX)

This one is impossible. After six tries using three different decks I decided to call it a day.

 

GAME: THE STEWARD'S FEAR

Heroes: Glorfindel, Haldir of Lorien and Idraen.

 

This deck seemed to work well with the scenario. Everything seemed to fall into place and the game was less of a struggle than I was expecting.

 

My final score was:

Completed Turns (6): 60

Threat: 41

VP: 1.

Total Score: 100

## 286 [silverthorn on April 4, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1527558)

GAME: PASSAGE THROUGH MIRKWOOD (PROGRESSION)

Heroes; Aragorn (Leadership), Denethor, Eowyn.

 

While I wait for the UK to get The Dark Realm I decided to give attempting missions using only cards available at that point another go. This game went well, if a little slowly. Aragorn's resources were barely used and I forgot that Celebrian's Stone gave him Spirit resource match. Regardless the final score was:

 

14 completed rounds = 140
Total combined Threat = 41
Total damage on Heroes = 1
Cost of dead Heroes = 0
Victory points = 0
TOTAL SCORE = 182

GAME: JOURNEY DOWN THE ANDUIN (PROGRESSION)


Heroes; Aragorn (Leadership), Denethor, Eowyn.


 


Proceeding onto the next quest I again made slow but steady progress. Getting Gandalf and 2 Sneak Attacks made it so that I was on 20 threat on turn 2. My final score was:


 




14 completed rounds = 140

Total combined Threat = 30

Total damage on Heroes = 1

Cost of dead Heroes = 0

Victory points = 4

TOTAL SCORE = 167

This quest is crazy. How in the name of all that is good and holy is this beatable. I guess it's time to try another deck since this one was hammered.

I just want to thank you for this thread. Great info, varied quests, varied decks, good write-ups and lots and lots of it.

Sometimes I cant play but still need my lotrlcg fix and reading peoples play reports on my kindle fixes that. This thread has a complete wealth of such reading to go at.

Thank you!

I use Halbarad, Elrohir, Elladan but its a deck designed to go with a second one. Definitely not enough questing power to be good on its own, an amazing combat deck though. Yours seems quite good as well just not on its own. If you can be bothered playing with two decks definitely give this line up another go but paired with a deck that can quest hard.

GAME : INTRUDERS IN CHETWOOD (ATTEMPT TWO)


Decks:


 


Player Set-Up.


After the success of the last game (or lack of it) I decided to go back to playing two-handed.


 


Deck A consists of Celeborn, Galadriel and Haldir of Lorien with a starting threat of 29. The starting hand was Galadhrim Minstrel, Henamarth Riversong, Light Of Valinor, Nalth Guide, O Lorien and The Day's Rising.


 


Deck B is a all-Tactics deck consisting of Aragorn, Beregond and Legolas with a starting threat of 31. The starting hand was Descendant of Thorandor, Eagles Of The Misty Mountains, Gondorian Shield, Meneldor's Flight, Radagast and Support Of The Eagles.


 


Quest Set-Up.


Stage 1 told me to add Iarion to the first player, deck A, and add a Orc War Party, Borders Of Breeland and Rugged Country to the staging area.


 


TURN ONE: FIRST PLAYER: DECK A.


 


Resource Phase.


I added a resource to all the heroes before deck A drew Wingfoot and deck B drew Radagast.


 


Planning Phase.


Deck A played O Lorien on Celeborn (Celeborn -1 resource), Henamarth Riversong (Haldir -1 resource) and Light Of Valinor on Celeborn (Galadriel -1 resource). Deck A then exhausted Galadriel to allow Deck B to draw Rohan Warhorse (Deck B threat: 30).


 


Deck B played Gondorian Shield on Beregond and Rohan Warhorse on Aragorn (Aragorn -1 resource).


 


Quest Phase.


Between the decks I committed Celeborn, Haldir, Henamarth Riversong and Iarion.


Draw 1 was Shrouded Hills, which surged to Weight Of Responsibility, which forced me to draw another Orc War Party.


Draw 2 was Angmar Captain.


I committed 8 willpower against 14 threat (Deck A threat: 35, deck B threat: 36).


 


Travel Phase.


I decided to travel to Borders of Breeland.


 


Encounter Phase.


Deck B optionally engages the first Orc War Party.


 


Combat Phase.


The Orc War Party attacks Beregond, doing no damage.


Aragorn and Legolas attack back, doing 4 damage thanks to Aragorn's ability.


 


Refresh Phase.


I refreshed all the cards (Deck A threat: 38, Deck B threat: 39).


 


TURN TWO: FIRST PLAYER: DECK B.


 


Resource Phase.


I added a resource to all the heroes before deck B drew Born Aloft and deck A drew O Lorien.


 


Planning Phase.


Deck B played Eagles Of The Misty Mountains (Beregond -2 resources, Legolas -2 resources).


 


Deck A exhausted O Lorien before playing Nalth Guide (Celborn -1 resource, Aragorn quests this turn without exhausting) and Wingfoot on Haldir (Haldir -1 resource). Deck A exhausted Galadriel to allow deck B to draw Support Of The Eagles (Deck B threat: 38) and exhausted Henamarth Riversong to look at the top card of the encounter deck.


 


Quest Phase.


Between the decks I committed Aragorn, Celeborn, Haldir (naming Location for Wingfoot), Iarion and Nalth Guide.


Draw 1 was Lost In The Wilderness, which moved all the cards in both hands under it.


Draw 2 was Outlying Homestead (Deck A threat: 39, Deck B threat: 39). On the (relative) upside Haldir readied thanks to Wingfoot.


I committed 10 willpower against 12 threat (deck A threat: 41, Deck B threat: 41).


 


Travel Phase.


No travel.


 


Encounter Phase.


No engagements.


 


Combat Phase.


The Orc War Party attacks Beregond again, doing no damage (and discarding Orc Rearguard as a shadow card).


Aragorn and Legolas attack the Orc War Party, inflicting another 4 damage and killing it, Legolas's ability adding 2 progress to Borders of Breeland before the Angmar Captain engages deck B.


 


Refresh Phase.


I refreshed all the cards (Deck A threat: 43, Deck B threat: 43).


 


TURN THREE: FIRST PLAYER: DECK A.


 


Resource Phase.


I added a resource to all the heroes before deck A drew Sneak Attack and deck B drew Eagles Of The Misty Mountains.


 


Planning Phase.


Deck B played Eagles Of The Misty Mountains (Aragorn -2 resources, Beregond -1 resource, Legolas -1 resource).


Deck A exhausted Henamarth Riversong to look at the top card of the deck.


 


Quest Phase.


The active quest is Lost In The Wilderness.


Between the decks I committed Celeborn, Eagles Of The Misty Mountains x2, Haldir Of Lorien, Iarion and Nalth Guide.


Draw 1 was Sudden Assault, which (besides really making me wish I had looked at the game text when I scried it with Henamarth) readies Haldir and forces the Orc War Party in the staging area to attack Deck A. I have no real choice but to throw Haldir under the proverbial bus by making him take the hit, killing him and cutting my willpower further.


After that issue I wound up committing 10 willpower against 9 threat. 1 progress was added to Borders Of Breeland.


 


Travel Phase.


No travel.


 


Encounter Phase.


No engagements.


 


Combat Phase.


Angmar Captain attacks Beregond. The attack does no damage.

TURN FOUR: FIRST PLAYER: DECK B.


 


Resource Phase.


I added a resource to all the heroes before deck B drew To The Eyrie and deck A drew Galadhrim Minstrel.


 


Planning Phase.


Deck A exhausts Galadriel to draw Sword That Was Broken (Deck A threat: 43).


 


Quest Phase.


Lost In The Wilderness is active quest.


Between the decks I committed Celeborn, Eagles Of The Misty Mountains x2, Henamarth Riversong and Nalth Guide.


Draw 1 was Outlying Homestead (Deck A threat: 44, Deck B threat: 45).


Draw 2 was Pressing Needs (Deck A threat: 46, Deck B threat: 47). I reluctantly switch active quest to stage 1B.


I committed 11 willpower against 8 threat. 3 progress is added to stage 1B.


 


Travel Phase.


I decided to travel to Rugged Country.


 


Encounter Phase.


No engagements.


 


Combat Phase.


The Orc War Party attacks Beregond. The shadow card is Chetwood Forest so I exhaust Legolas.


Aragorn attacks back, doing 1 damage.


 


Refresh Phase.


I refreshed all the cards (Deck A threat: 47, Deck B threat: 48).


 


TURN FIVE: FIRST PLAYER: DECK A.


 


Resource Phase.


I added a resource to all the heroes before deck A drew Silvan Refugee and deck B drew Vassal of the Windlord.


 


Planning Phase.


Deck A exhausted Galadriel to draw Silvan Tracker (deck A threat: 46) before playing Sword That Was Broken on Aragorn (Celeborn -3 resources) and Silvan Refugee.


 


Deck B played Vassal Of The Windlord (Aragorn -1 resource).


 


Quest Phase.


Current quest is Lost In The Wilderness.


Between the decks I committed Celeborn, Eagles Of The Misty Mountains x1, Henamarth Riversong, Iarion, Nalth Guide, Silvan Refugee and Vassal Of The Windlord.


Draw 1 was Outlying Homestead (Deck A threat: 47, Deck B threat: 49).


Draw 2 was Angmar Marauder.


I committed 14 willpower against 11 threat. 3 progress was added to Rugged Country, exploring it.


 


Travel Phase.


I travelled to Shrouded Hills.


 


Encounter Phase.


No optional engagements.


 


Combat Phase.


The Orc War Party attacks Beregond, doing no damage.


Aragorn, Legolas and a Eagles Of The Misty Mountains attack back, killing the Orc War Party. Legolas's ability adds 2 progress to Shrouded Hills. Angmar Marauder engages deck B.


 


Refresh Phase.


I refreshed all the cards (Deck A threat: 48, Deck B threat: 50 and threat out).


 


With deck B threating out I called it a day.


 


This quest is ridiculous. I'm starting to think that I like the decks I used but I may need to try them out on a less stupid quest first.

I draw Border Of Breeland and Angmar Marauder.


I manage 29 willpower against 20 threat so 9 more progress is made, enough to win the game.


 


This quest is a monster. I was busy using Deck B's fair questing numbers to kill enemies when I could have used them and rushed the end of the quest a little earlier. I was lucky in that three of the side quests showed up as shadow cards so I dodged those bullets.


 


All in all, a not bad quest and the idea that this might be the easiest quest in the set is a little scary.


 


My combined final score was:


 


Completed Turns (7): 70.


Combined Threat: 70


Total Score: 140.

To start the turn I added a resource to all the heroes before deck A drew Hobbit Pipe and deck B drew Ranger Summons.


Deck B exhausted Steward Of Gondor to add 2 resources to Aragorn.


Gleowine exhausts so that deck A can draw Wingfoot.


 


Planning Phase.


Deck B pays 1 from Halbarad to play Ranger Summons and add a Ranger of the North into the encounter deck before paying 3 from Aragorn to play Farmer Maggott.


Deck A pays 1 from Frodo and Idraen to play Frodo Baggins, who scryes for another Hobbit Pipe before paying 1 from Beravor to play Wingfoot on her.


 


Quest Phase.


I committed Arwen (adding her defence buff to Halbarad), Beravor (naming Location for Wingfoot), Bilbo Baggins, Bill The Pony, Idraen, Northern Tracker and Sam Gamgee.


The draws were Enchanted Stream (which readied Beravor) and Forest Spider.


I committed 13 versus 5 threat so 8 progress was added to stage 3B.


 


Travel Phase.


Travel to Enchanted Stream.


 


Encounter Phase.


Deck B engages Forest Spider.


 


Combat Phase.


After adding shadow cards Forest Spider attacks Farmer Maggott, killing him.


Aragorn and Halbarad attack Forest Spider, killing it.


Sam Gamgee exhausts Fast Hitch to ready himself.


 


Refresh Phase.


At the end of the turn I refreshed all the cards before raising deck A's threat to 35 and Deck B's to 34.


 


TURN SEVEN: First Player: Deck A.


 


Resource Phase.


To start the turn I added a resource to all the heroes before deck A drew Unexpected Courage and deck B drew Galadriel.


Deck B exhausted Steward of Gondor to add 2 resources to Aragorn.


 


Planning Phase.


Deck A paid 1 from Frodo and Idraen to play Unexpected Courage on Aragorn.


Deck B paid 1 from Halbarad and 2 from Sam to play Galadriel. Her ability put Sword That Was Broken on Aragorn.


 


Quest Phase.


I committed Aragorn (readying himself with Unexpected Courage), Arwen (adding her defence buff to Halbarad), Beravor (naming Location for Wingfoot), Bilbo Baggins, Bill The Pony, Galadriel, Gleowine, Halbarad, Idraen, Northern Tracker and Sam Gamgee.


The draws were Forest Gate and East Bight Patrol.


In the end I managed a a total of 26 willpower against 6 threat. The 20 progress was more than enough to explore the stage and win the game.


 


This was interesting, there are cards in these decks which I would normally never put into a deck so as I go this will get more and more interesting. As it is, the two decks seem to gel together well and I'll see how it goes as the quests get tougher.


 


In the end the final combined score was:


Completed Turns (6): 60


Combined Threat: 69


Damage on heroes: 2


Total score: 131.

> Does anyone know a good place to record my adventures? The FFG official is really clunky and buggy.

 

I'm not sure, I used to use the FFG one but decided against it for the reasons you state.

 

As a aside, I was looking through my exploits that I recorded here and I noted that I hadn't attempted a all-Gondor deck. I then realised that I don't think I've ever played a all-Gondor deck. In a attempt to rectify this I've built two decks (since the low WIllpower will probably need more than three heroes to get around) and will be posting reports on all the non-Hobbit quests soon-ish.

GAME: PASSAGE THROUGH MIRKWOOD.


 


I decided, after two badly failed attempts at playing all-Gondor decks (being location-locked twice on the easiest quest in the game told me that I was right about Gondor decks) so I went back to trying out the Secret Defenders decks from https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2015/3/12/the-secret-defenders/ [https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2015/3/12/the-secret-defenders/], taking them through all the non-Hobbit quests and making modifications as needed.


 


Deck #1 consisted of Beravor, Frodo Baggins and Idraen with a starting threat of 28. Their starting hand was Ancient Mathon, Athelas, Bilbo Baggins, Gandalf (Core) and Strength Of Will x2.


 


Deck #2 consisted of Aragorn (Tactics), Halbarad and Sam Gamgee with a starting threat of 30. The starting hand was Dunedain Hunter, Dunedain Watcher, Gandalf (Core), Halfling Determination, Son Of Arnor and Weather Hills Watchman.


 


To set up the quest I added Forest Spider and Old Forest Gate to the staging area.


 


I started turn 1 by making deck #1 first player and adding a resource to all the heroes before deck #1 drew Henamarth Riversong and deck #2 drew Heir Of Valandil.


 


During planning Deck #1 paid 1 from Frodo and Idraen to play Bilbo Baggins (who put a Hobbit Pipe into hand) before playing Hobbit Pipe on Frodo and paying 1 from Beravor to play Henamarth Riversong. Deck #2 paid 1 from Halbarad and Sam to play Weather Hills Watchman (who put a Ranger Summons into hand) and played Dunedain Hunter, who put Black Forest Bats into play engaged with deck #2. I then exhausted Henamarth Riversong to look at the top card of the encounter deck, Forest Spider, and returned it to the top of the deck.


 


In the quest phase I committed Beravor, Bilbo Baggins, Halbarad (thanks to his ability), Idraen and Sam Gamgee. The draws were Forest Spider and Driven By Shadow, which added 1 to the threat of the cards in the staging area. I committed 13 against 8 threat so 5 progress was added to stage 1B before the heroes travelled to Old Forest Road, which readied Sam Gamgee.


 


During the encounter phase deck #2 optionally engaged a Forest Spider before deck #1 engaged the other Forest Spider.


 


The Forest Spider engaged with deck #1 made a undefended attack against Frodo. The shadow card was Mountains of Mirkwood, for no effect and the attack raised deck #1's threat to 31. The Forest Spider engaged with deck #2 attacked the Dunedain Hunter. The shadow card was The Necromancer's Reach, for no effect and the attack did 2 damage. The Black Forest Bats attacked Weather Hills Watchman. The shadow card was Chieftain Ufthak for no effect and the attack did no damage. Aragorn attacked the Forest Spider, killing it before Aragorn's ability triggered and made the Forest Spider engaged with deck #1 engage deck #2. Halbarad and Sam attacked the Black Forest Bats, killing it.


 


After a productive combat phase I readied all cards before raising deck #1's threat to 32 and deck #2's to 31.


 


Turn Two began with deck #2 becoming first player before I added a resource to the heroes. Deck #2 drew Sword That Was Broken and deck #1 drew Will Of The West.


 


In planning deck #2 paid 1 from Halbarad to play Ranger Summons (adding a Ranger of the North into the encounter deck). Deck #1 paid 1 from Frodo to play Ancient Mathon on the active Old Forest Road. Henamarth Riversong exhausted to look at the top card of the encounter deck, Enchanted Stream, and returned it to the encounter deck.


 


During the quest phase I committed Beravor, Bilbo Baggins, Frodo, Halbarad (using his ability), Idraen and Sam Gamgee. I drew Enchanted Stream and Necromancer's Pass. I managed 13 against 5 threat. 3 progress explored Old Forest Road (Ancient Mathon allowed deck #2 to draw Dagger of Westernesse, Gandalf (Core) and Secret Vigil) and 5 progress was added to stage 1B, exploring it and moving to stage 2B. The heroes then moved to Enchanted Stream.


 


The Forest Spider attacked Halbarad. The shadow card was Enchanted Stream, for no effect and the attack did no damage. Aragorn attacked the Forest Spider and killed it thanks to his defence lowering ability.


 


At the end of the turn I readied everything before deck #2's threat increased to 32 and deck #1's increased to 33.


 


Turn Three began with deck #1 becoming first player before I added a resource to all heroes.


 


In the planning phase deck #1 paid 1 from Frodo and 2 from Beravor and Idraen to play Gandalf (Core), using his ability to lower deck #1's threat to 28. Deck #2 paid 2 from Sam and 1 from Halbarad to play Sword That Was Broken on Aragorn before paying 1 from Aragorn to play Dagger of Westernesse on Aragorn. Henamarth Riversong exhausted to look at the top card of the encounter deck, yet another Forest Spider, and return it to the encounter deck.


 


During the quest phase I committed Beravor, Bilbo Baggins, Frodo, Gandalf, Idraen and Sam Gamgee. The draws were Forest Spider and Dol Goldur Orcs (which added 2 damage to Gandalf). I committed 16 against 7 threat. 2 progress explored Enchanted Stream (readying Idraen) and the other 7 progress was added to stage 2B, exploring it. The random stage 3B was 'Beorn's Path'.


 


After travelling to Necromancer's Pass, which forced deck #1 to discard Athelas and Will Of The West, deck #2 optionally engaged the Forest Spider and Dol Goldur Orcs, thanks to Halbarad's ability.


 


The Forest Spider attacked Weather Hills Watchman. The shadow card was Mountains Of Mirkwood, which did nothing but the attack killed the Weather Hills Watchman. The Dol Goldur Orcs attacked Dunedain Hunter. The shadow card was The Necromancer's Reach, which did nothing. The attack finished off the Dunedain Hunter. Aragorn and Halbarad attacked and killed the Forest Spider.


 


At the end of the turn I readied everything before discarding Gandalf and raising deck #1's threat to 29 and deck #2's to 33.


 


Turn Four began with deck #2 becoming first player before I added a resource to all heroes. Deck #2 drew another Sword That Was Broken and deck #1 drew Will Of The West.


 


In planning deck #2 paid 1 from Halbarad and Sam to play Heir of Valandil on Aragorn and paid 1 from Aragorn to play Secret Vigil on Dol Goldur Orcs. Deck #1


 


In the quest phase I committed Aragorn, Beravor, Bilbo Baggins, Frodo, Halbarad (thanks to his ability), Henamarth Riversong, Idraen and Sam Gamgee. The draw was Great Forest Web and Eyes Of The Forest, which forced deck #2 to discard Halfling Determination and deck #1 to discard 2 Strength of Will and a Will Of The West. I committed 19 willpower against 2 threat. 2 progress explored Necromancer's Pass and the other 15 progress was placed on Stage 3B, exploring it and winning the game.


 


This was a lot different to playing with the all-Gondor decks. The far higher willpower made things more managable. In the end, the combined score was:


 


Completed Turns (3): 30


Combined Threat: 62


Total Score: 92.

Nice write up (as usual)!

 

One thing -- I think that on Turn 5 when you "exhausted no one" for the hide test that you forgot to take the attack from the Black Rider from its forced effect. It's possible that you just didn't write that part up, but just wanted to let you know. You probably could have engaged it optionally to the (roughly) the same outcome assuming you passed that hide test.

I forgot about that (It's been a bad week and I think I was probably paying less attention than I should have),

We all have those moments. I played mono leadership against Shadow of the Past, but forgot that Frodo should have kept all of my "if all your heroes have printed leadership icon" type effects from working. I'll probably rethink my own campaign now that I caught that one.

GAME: PASSAGE THROUGH MIRKWOOD.


 


For this run-through of the post-Hobbit quests I decided to use the Secret Defenders decks (https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2015/3/12/the-secret-defenders/ [https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2015/3/12/the-secret-defenders/]) from the article on the site.


 


The Hunters of the North consisted of Aragorn (Tactics), Halbarad and Sam Gamgee for 30 starting threat. Their starting hand was Bill The Pony, Dunedain Huter, Farmer Maggott, Steward of Gondor and Sword That Was Broken x2.


 


The Watchful Protectors consisted of Beravor, Frodo Baggins and Idraen for 30 starting threat. Their starting hand was A Test Of Will, Ancient Mathom, Gandalf (Core), Hobbit Pipe, Smoke Rings and Will Of The West. After due consideration I decided to mulligan, drawing Athelas, Fast Hitch x2, Gleowine, Northern Tracker and Wingfoot.


 


Quest set-up consisted of adding Forest Spider and Old Forest Road to the staging area.


 


Turn One saw the Protectors take first player before I added resources [Aragorn +1, Beravor +1, Frodo Baggins +1, Halbarad +1, Idraen +1, Sam Gamgee +1] before the Protectors drew Athelas and the Hunters drew Son Of Arnor.


 


Moving to planning the Protectors played Wingfoot on Beravor [beravor -1] before the Hunters played Bill The Pony and Dunedain Hunter (whose ability pulled a Dol Goldur Orcs out of the encounter deck and engaged it with the Hunters) before playing Steward of Gondor on Halbarad [Halbarad -1, Sam Gamgee -1] then exhausted Steward of Gondor [Halbarad +2].


 


Proceeding to questing I committed Beravor (naming Enemy for Wingfoot), Bill The Pony, Frodo Baggins, Halbarad, Idraen and Sam Gamgee. I then drew Dol Goldur Beastmaster (which readied Beravor) and Black Forest Bats (which removed Halbarad and Idraen from the quest). In the end I committed 8 against 6 threat so 2 progress was added to stage 1B.


 


After I travelled to Old Forest Road (which readies Frodo Baggins) the Hunters optionally engaged Forest Spider before the Protectors engaged the Black Forest Bats.


 


The Dol Goldur Orcs attacked Halbarad, doing no damage before the Forest Spider attacked Dunedain Hunter, inflicting 2 damage. The Black Forest Bats attacked Frodo, doing no damage.


 


In return, Beravor attacked and killed the Black Forest Bats and Aragorn attacked and killed the Dol Goldur Orcs. Aragorn's ability triggered and forced the Dol Goldur Beastmaster to engage the Hunters.


 


At the end of the round I readied everyone before the Protectors raised their threat to 31 and the Hunters raised theirs to 31.


 


Turn Two began with the Hunters becoming first player before I added resources [Aragorn +1, Beravor +1, Frodo Baggins +1, Halbarad +1, Idraen +1, Sam Gamgee +1] before the Hunters drew Gondorian Spearman and the Protectors drew Wingfoot.


 


During the planning phase the Hunters exhausted Steward of Gondor [Halbarad +2] before playing Sword That Was Broken on Aragorn [Halbarad -3] and Gondorian Spearman [Aragorn -2]. The Protectors played Northern Tracker [Frodo Baggins -2, Idraen -2] and Fast Hitch on Frodo Baggins [beravor -1].


 


Moving onto the quest phase I committed Beravor (naming Enemy for Wingfoot), Frodo Baggins (readying him with Fast Hitch), Halbarad, Idraen, Northern Tracker and Sam Gamgee. I then drew Mountains Of Mirkwood and Enchanted Stream. I managed 14 willpower against 4 threat. 3 progress was added to Old Forest Road, exploring it (and readying Idraen) before 7 progress was added to stage 1B, exploring it and moving to stage 2.


 


After travelling to Mountains Of Mirkwood and adding Forest Gate to the staging area I skipped the encounter phase.


 


The Dol Goldur Beastmaster attacked the Gondorian Spearman (taking 1 damage from the Spearman) and killed him. The Forest Spider attacked Halbarad, inflicting no damage. The Dunedain Hunter counter-attacked, inflicting 2 damage on the Dol Goldur Beastmaster before Aragorn and Bill The Pony attacked the Forest Spider, killing it.


 


At the end of the round I refreshed everything before the Hunters raised their threat to 32 and the Protectors raised theirs to 32.


 


Turn Three began with the Protectors becoming first player before I added resources [Aragorn +1, Beravor +1, Frodo Baggins +1, Halbarad +1, Idraen +1, Sam Gamgee +1] and the Protectors drew Gandalf (Core) and the Hunters drew Foe-Hammer.


 


After I exhausted Steward of Gondor [Halbarad +2] the Protectors played 2 Athelas on Beravor before the Hunters played Son of Arnor [Halbarad -3].


 


In the quest phase I committed Beravor (naming Enemy for Wingfoot), Frodo Baggins (readying him with Fast Hitch), Halbarad, Idraen, Northern Tracker (adding a progress to Enchanted Stream and Forest Gate) and Sam Gamgee. I drew Great Forest Web and Forest Spider (which readied Beravor). I managed 14 willpower against 8 threat. 3 progress was added to Mountains Of Mirkwood, exploring it (which allowed The Protectors to add Henamarth Riversong to their hand and the Hunter to add Celebrian's Stone to their hand and readied Idraen). 3 progress was added to stage 2B, exploring it before I randomly selected “Beorn's Path”.


 


After moving to Forest Gate (the Protectors drew Gather Information and The Galadhrim's Greeting) the Forest Spider engaged the Protectors.


 


The Forest Spider attacked Frodo, raising the Protectors threat to 33. The Dol Goldur Beastmaster attacked Halbarad, inflicting 1 wound.


 


Idraen attacked Forest Spider, inflicting 1 damage. Aragorn attacked Dol Goldur Beastmaster, killing it. Aragorn's ability allowed the Hunters to engage the Forest Spider engaged with the Protectors before Dunedain Hunter and Bill The Pony attacked and killed the Forest Spider.


 


At the end of the round I refreshed all the cards before the Protectors raised their threat to 34 and the Hunters raised theirs to 33.


 


Turn Four began with the Hunters becoming first player before I added resources [Aragorn +1, Beravor +1, Frodo Baggins +1, Halbarad +1, Idraen +1, Sam Gamgee +1]. The Hunters drew Ranger Summons and the Protectors drew Ancient Mathom.


 


Moving to planning the Hunters exhausted Steward of Gondor [Halbarad +2] before they played Ranger Summons [Halbarad -1] (adding a Ranger of the North to the encounter deck) and Celebrian's Stone on Sam Gamgee [Halbarad -2]. The Protectors played Fast Hitch on Sam Gamgee [beravor -1] and The Galadhrim's Greeting [Frodo Baggins -2, Idraen -1] (which lowered the Hunters threat to 31 and the Protectors to 32).


 


In the quest phase I committed Aragorn, Beravor (naming Enemy for Wingfoot), Bill The Pony, Dunedain Hunter, Frodo Baggins (readying with Fast Hitch), Idraen, Northern Tracker (which adds a resource to Enchanted Stream (exploring it) and Great Forest Web), Sam Gamgee (readying with Fast Hitch) and Son Of Arnor. I drew Enchanted Stream and Dol Goldur Beastmaster. I committed 24 willpower against 6 threat. 3 progress was added to Forest Gate, exploring it (and readying Idraen) before 15 progress was added to stage 3B, exploring it and winning the game.


 


These decks work well straight from the article.

GAME: INTRUDERS IN CHETWOOD.


 


I decided to try out the decks from the Elven Realms Unite articles on the site.


 


The Elven Hightborn comprise Celeborn, Elrond and Galadriel with 33 starting threat. Their starting hand was Defender Of The Nalth, Elrond's Counsel, Galadriel's Handmaiden x2, Island Amid Perils and Unexpected Courage. I decided to mulligan, drawing A Test Of Will, Arwen Undomiel, Defender Of The Nalth, Light Of Valinor, Nalth Guide and Stand and Fight.


 


The Spears Of Mirkwood comprise Haldir Of Lorien, Legolas and Mirlonde with 24 starting threat. Since the deck list on the site has 1 more Henamarth Riversong than I have I swapped it for Arod. Their starting hand was Feint, Galadhon Archer, Mirkwood Runner, Pursuing The Enemy, Rivendell Blade and Silvan Tracker. After considering my options I decided to mulligan, drawing Foe-Hammer, Galadhrim Minstrel, Hands Upon The Bow, Mirkwood Runner, Rivendell Bow and Silvan Tracker.


 


Quest set-up consisted of attaching Iarion to the first player (the Highborn) and adding Orc War Party, Shrouded Hills and Rugged Country to the staging area.

The Highborn exhausted Galadriel to draw O Lorien and reduce their threat to 32 before paying 1 from Galadriel to play Light Of Valinor on Elrond and 1 from Celeborn and Elrond to play Nalth Guide (Celeborn quests without exhausting this turn).


 


The Spears paid 1 from Legolas to play Rivendell Bow on Mirlonde before paying 1 from Haldir of Mirlonde to play Galadhrim Minstrel, adding Unseen Strike to the Spears' hand. The Spears proceeded to play The Tree People, returning the Galadhrim Minstrel to their hand before putting a Silvan Tracker into play.


 


Quest Phase.


I committed Celeborn, Elrond, Iarion, Nalth Guide (buffed) and Silvan Tracker (buffed). I then drew Angmar Marauder and Rugged Country. I committed 11 against 11 threat so no progress was made.


 


Travel Phase.


Travel to Rugged Country.


 


Encounter Phase.


The Highborn engaged the Angmar Marauder.


 


Combat Phase.


The Angmar Marauder attacked Elrond. The shadow card was Orc Rearguard, for no effect and the attack did no damage. Haldir and Legolas attacked the Angmar Marauder, killing it. Legolas's ability triggered and added 2 progress to Rugged Country.

I readied the cards before raising the Highborn's threat to 33 and the Spears to 25.

Quest Phase.


I committed Arwen Undomiel (buffed), Celeborn, Elrond, Iarion, Nalth Guide, Silvan Tracker (buffed) and Silvan Tracker. I then drew Borders Of Breeland and Shrouded Hills. I committed 14 against 9 threat so 1 progress explored Rugged Country and 4 was added to stage 1B.

No engagements.


 


Combat Phase.


No combat.


 


Refresh Phase.


I readied the cards before raising the Highborn's threat to 35 and the Spears to 27 (I forgot to add the extra threat from the Orc War Party in turn one so I've adjusted the threat totals now).


 


Turn Three – First Player: The Highborn.


 


Resource Phase.


I added a resource to all the heroes before the Highborn drew Silvan Refugee and the Spears drew Pursuing The Enemy.


 


Planning Phase.


The Highborn exhausted Galadriel to draw Arwen Undomiel and reduce their threat to 34 before exhausting O Lorien and paying 1 from Celeborn and Elrond to play Defender of the Nalth.

Quest Phase.


I committed Arwen Undomiel (adding her buff and Sentinel to Elrond), Celeborn, Defender of the Nalth (buffed), Elrond, Galadhrim Minstrel (buffed), Iarion, Nalth Guide and 2 Silvan Trackers. I drew Outlying Homestead, which raised the Highborn's threat to 35 and the Spears to 28, and Angmar Marauder. I managed 15 against 12 threat so 3 progress was added to Borders of Breeland.


 


Travel Phase.


Travel to Rugged Country.

The Spears played Unseen Strike on Legolas before Haldir, Legolas and Mirlonde attacked the Orc War Party, killing it thanks to the buff from Unseen Strike. The Spears then played Foe-Hammer and exhausted the Rivendell Bow on Mirlonde to draw Galadhon Archer, Henamarth Riversong and Rumil. Legolas' ability triggered and added 1 progress to Borders of Breeland, exploring it and adding 1 more progress to stage 1B.


 


Refresh Phase.


I readied the cards before raising the Highborn's threat to 37 and the Spears to 30.


 


Turn Four – First Player: The Spears.

GAME: A SHADOW OF THE PAST.


 


After dabbling with building a solo deck I decided to resume playing two-handed. I took the heroes from one deck I had been using and one of the heroes from the other and made up two decks without taking them from the FFG main news page.


 


Deck #1 consisted of Eowyn, Haldir of Lorien and Idraen with a total of 29 threat. Their starting hand was Fast Hitch, Henamarth Riversong, Light Of Valinor, Song Of Travel and Warden Of Healing.


 


Deck #2 consisted of Aragorn (Tactics), Halbarad and Sam Gamgee with a total of 30 threat. Their starting hand was Bill The Pony, Feint, Ranger Summons, Secret Vigil and Weather Hills Watchman.


 


In addition Frodo Baggins (with Mr. Underhill and The One Ring) was put into play attached to deck #1.


 


After putting Gandalf's Delay into play I added a Black Rider to staging area and made Bag End the active location.


 


Turn One began with deck #1 becoming first player before adding resources [Aragorn +1 (1), Eowyn +1 (1), Frodo Baggins +1 (1), Halbarad +1 (1), Haldir Of Lorien +1 (1), Idraen +1 (1) and Sam Gamgee +1 (1)]. Deck #1 drew Cloak Of Lorien and deck #2 drew Dunedain Hunter.


 


During planning deck #1 played Light Of Valinor on Haldir of Lorien [Eowyn -1 (0)] and Fast Hitch on Sam Gamgee [Haldir of Lorien -1 (0)] before deck #2 played Bill The Pony and Weather Hills Watchman, which added a Ranger Summons to deck #2's hand [Halbarad -1 (0), Sam Gamgee -1 (0)] before playing Dunedain Hunter, which unfortunately forced deck #2 to engage a Black Rider. On the upside, Sam was buffed for the rest of the round.


 


During the quest phase I committed Eowyn, Frodo Baggins, Halbarad, Haldir, Idraen and Sam Gamgee (readying with Fast Hitch). Deck #1 drew Gildor Inglorion who was controlled for now by deck #1 before deck #2 drew Green Hill Country. I committed 16 against 6 threat so 3 progress was added to Bag End, exploring it, readying Idraen and allowing deck #1 to draw Light Of Valinor and deck #2 to draw Captain Of Gondor before adding Bag End to the victory display before another progress explored stage 1B. Stage 2B added another Black Rider to the staging area.


 


After the Fellowship travelled to Green Hill Country and made no optional engagements the Black Rider attacked Weather Hills Watchman. The shadow card was Stock Road, which had no effect but the attack killed the Watchman. In response Aragorn, Dunedain Hunter, Halbarad, Haldir Of Lorien and Sam Gamgee attacked and killed the Black Rider before Aragorn's ability forced one of the other Black Riders in the staging area to engage deck #2.


 


At the end of the turn I readied all the cards before deck #1 raised it's threat to 30 and deck #2 raised to 31. I then retained Gildor Inglorion [Frodo Baggins -1 (0)].


 


Turn Two began with deck #2 becoming first player and gaining control of Gildor Inglorion before adding resources [Aragorn +1 (2), Eowyn +1 (1), Frodo Baggins +1 (1), Halbarad +1 (1), Haldir Of Lorien +1 (1), Idraen +1 (2) and Sam Gamgee +1 (1)]. Deck #2 drew Weather Hills Watchman and deck #1 drew The Galadhrim's Greeting.


 


During planning deck #2 played Weather Hills Watchman, which added Dunedain Warning to deck #2's hand [Halbarad -1 (0), Sam Gamgee -1 (0)] and Captain Of Gondor on Aragorn [Aragorn -1 (1)]. Deck #1 played The Galadhrim's Greeting, reducing deck #1's threat to 28 and deck #2's to 29 [Eowyn -1 (0), Idraen -2 (0)].


 


During questing I committed Eowyn, Frodo Baggins, Halbarad, Haldir, Idraen and Sam Gamgee (readying with Fast Hitch). Deck #2 drew Stock Road and deck #1 drew Green Hill Country. I committed 15 willpower against 9 threat. 3 progress was added to Green Hill Country, exploring it and readying Idraen before 4 progress was added to stage 2B.


 


After the Fellowship travelled to Green Hill Country and decided against optionally engaging, the Black Rider engaged with deck #2 attacked Gildor Inglorion. The shadow card was The Ring Draws Them, which had no effect and the attack did 2 damage to Gildor. In response, Aragorn, Halbarad, Haldir and Sam Gamgee attacked and killed the Black Rider. Aragorn's ability triggered and forced the Black Rider in the staging area to engage deck #2. Bill The Pony, Dunedain Hunter and the Weather Hills Watchman attacked the new Black Rider and inflicted 1 point of damage.


 


At the end of the turn I readied all cards before deck #2 raised it's threat to 30 and deck #1 raised to 29. I then paid 1 from Frodo to retain Gildor Inglorion.


 


Turn three began with deck #1 becoming first player before I added resources to my heroes. Deck #1 drew Arwen Undomiel and deck #2 drew Son Of Arnor.


 


During planning deck #1 paid 1 from Eowyn and Idraen to play Arwen Undomiel and paid 2 from Haldir to play Warden of Healing. Deck #2 paid 1 from Halbarad to play Dunedain Warning on him and paid 1 from Sam Gamgee to play Ranger Summons and shuffle a Ranger of the North into the encounter deck.


 


Moving to questing I committed Arwen Undomiel (adding her defence buff and Sentinel to Halbarad), Eowyn, Gildor Inglorion, Halbarad, Haldir, Idraen, Sam Gamgee (readying with Fast Hitch) and Warden Of Healing. Deck #1 drew Woody End and deck #2 drew Pathless Country. I committed 21 against 6 threat. 3 progress explored Green Hill Country and readied Idraen before 12 progress was added to stage 2B, exploring it and moving onto stage 3. Stage 3A added Buckleberrry Ferry to the staging area and stage 3B added another Black Rider to the staging area.


 


After the Fellowship travelled to Pathless Country and decided against optionally engaging the Black Rider attacked Weather Hills Watchman. The shadow card was Green Hill Country, which buffed the Black Rider's attack and over-killed the Weather Hills Watchman. Aragorn, Bill The Pony, Halbarad and Haldir attacked the Black Rider, killing it before Aragorn's ability pulled the Black Rider into engagement with deck #2, which buffed Sam Gamgee, who attacked the Black Rider with Dunedain Hunter, doing 1 point of damage.


 


After readying all cards deck #1 raised it's threat to 30 and deck #2's to 31 before I paid 1 from Frodo to retain Gildor.


 


Turn Four began with deck #2 becoming first player and all heroes gaining a resource before deck #2 drew Ranger Summons and deck #1 drew Waters Of Nimrodel.


 


In the planning phase deck #2 paid 1 from Halbarad and Sam to play 2 Ranger Summons and shuffle 2 Rangers of the North into the encounter deck.


 


In the quest phase I committed Arwen Undomiel (adding her defence buff and sentinel to Halbarad), Eowyn, Frodo Baggins, Gildor Inglorion, Halbarad, Haldir, Idraen, Sam Gamgee (readying with Fast Hitch) and Warden Of Healing. Deck #2 drew Ranger Of The North, who attached to deck #1 and inflicted 2 damage to the Black Rider engaged with deck #1 before deck #2 drew Pathless Country. I committed 21 against 9 threat. 3 progress explored Pathless Country and readied Idraen.


 


After the Fellowship travelled to another Pathless Country and skipped the encounter phase the Black Rider's attack was neutralized when I paid 1 from Aragorn to play Feint. Aragorn, Halbarad, Haldir and Sam Gamgee attacked and killed the Black Rider.


 


At the end of the turn I readied all the cards before deck #2 raised it's threat to 32 and deck #1 raised to 31 before I paid 1 from Frodo to retain Gildor.


 


Turn Five began with deck #1 becoming first player and all heroes gaining a resource. Deck #1 drew Northern Tracker and deck #2 drew Defender Of Rammas.


 


During planning deck #1 paid 2 from Eowyn and Idraen to play Northern Tracker before deck #2 paid 2 from Aragorn to play Defender of Rammas.


 


In the quest phase I committed Arwen Undomiel (adding her defence buff to Defender of Rammas), Eowyn, Frodo Baggins, Gildor Inglorion, Haldir, Idraen, Northern Tracker (adding 1 progress to all locations in the staging area and exploring Woody End), Ranger of the North, Sam Gamgee (readying with Fast Hitch) and Warden Of Healing. Deck #1 drew another Ranger Of The North, which attached to player #2 and added 2 progress to Stock Road, exploring it and readying Idraen before deck #2 drew Evil Crow. I committed 22 willpower against 5 threat so 3 progress explored Pathless Country.


 


Deck #1 exhausted Haldir and Ranger of the North before drawing Have You Seen Baggins, Ranger of the North and Black Steed. I committed 4 willpower against 0 threat so the Felllowship travelled to Buckleberry Ferry.


 


Deck #2 opted to optionally engage the Evil Crow, which buffed Sam before the crow attacked Defender of Rammas. The shadow card was Have You Seen Baggins, for no effect and the attack did no damage. Aragorn then attacked and killed the Evil Crow.


 


At the end of the turn I readied all cards before deck #1 raised it's threat to 32 and deck #2 raised it's to 33 before I paid 1 from Frodo to retain Gildor.


 


Turn Six began with deck #2 becoming first player and all heroes gaining resources before deck #2 drew Bow of Galadhrim and deck #1 drew Power Of Orthanc.


 


After skipping planning I committed Aragorn, Arwen Undomiel (adding her buff to Halbarad), Dunedain Hunter, Eowyn, Frodo Baggins, Gildor Inglorion, Halbarad, Haldir, Idraen, Northern Tracker, Ranger of the North x2, Sam Gamgee (readying with Fast Hitch) and Warden Of Healing. Deck #2 drew Evil Crow and deck #1 drew The Marish. I committed 30 willpower against 5 threat making more than enough progress to explored the Buckleberry Ferry and complete the quest.


 


In the aftermath I chose to add The Ring Draws Them and Mr. Underhill to the quest log.


 


My final score was:


 


Completed Turns (5): 50.


Total Threat: 65.


VP: 1.


Total Score: 114.

GAME: A SHADOW OF THE PAST.

 

I decided to try something new, namely put together two Dwarf decks to put through the LOTR saga quests.

 

Deck #1 was Bifur (who, thanks to drawing a low amount of Leadership Dwarves churned out a large number of Lore cards thanks to his ability as well as questing), Dain (who did what Dain always does and buffed everyone else) and Gloin (who quested but never got involved in a fight).

 

Deck #2 was Gimli (who mostly defended and was healed by Self-Preservation since deck #2 didn't draw Unexpected Courage), Nori (who quested most turns or helped out on fights when needed, as well as dropping deck #2's threat most turns) and Thalin (who quested and damaged most enemies).

 

The game went well, as I said above everyone played their part and the two decks performed better than I expected. At the end of the proceedings I added Gandalf's Delay and Mr. Underhill to the campaign log.

 

In the end my total score was:

Completed Turns (8): 80.

Combined threat: 63.

Total Hero Damage: 1.

Total VP: 3.

Total Score: 141.

GAME: THE OLD FOREST.


 


This quest was a slog. By the end of turn 13 I was running out of allies to feed to Old Man Willow and the heroes were all on at least two wounds (thankfully, Hardy Leadership was in play). Despite all that, I managed to slog out a win with exactly 12 wounds on Old Man Willow (thanks to Gimli having 13 wounds on him but two Citadel Plates on him to give him 1 remaining wound).


 


Deck #1 was Bifur (who again, fed a large amount of Lore cards using his ability), Dain (who did what Dain always does and buffed everyone else) and Gloin (who took a lot of damage but was healed by Self-Preservation).


 


Deck #2 was Gimli (who was a absolute monster, hitting for 15 on the last turn to damage Old Man Willow enough for the end of game loot), Nori (who quested most turns or helped out on fights when needed, as well as dropping deck #2's threat most turns) and Thalin (who quested and damaged enemies like he normally does).


 


The game went well and I managed to fluke my first win against this quest. In the end I added Old Bogey-Stories to the boon list.


 


In the end my total score was:


Completed Turns (12): 120.


Combined threat: 92.


Total Hero Damage: 23.


Total VP: 0.

GAME: MASSING AT OSGILIATH (ATTEMPT ONE)


 


Since I've got less time to write up two-handed games I decided to switch back to playing true solo.


 


My deck for this run-through was a old favourite of mine, Beorn, Beregond and Eowyn with 31 starting threat and a hand comprising Descendant of Thorandor, Ethir Swordsman, Gwalihir, Power Of Orthanc, Radagast and Song Of Travel. After some consideration I decided to mulligan, drawing Descendant Of Thorandor, Ethir Swordsman, Gather Information, Gwalihir, Horn Of Gondor and Song Of Battle.


 


Quest set-up consisted of adding Snaga Scouts, Wainriders and Wolves From Mordor to the staging area.


 


Turn One began with me adding a resource to my heroes before I drew Feint.


 


After skipping planning I committed Eowyn and drew hit lucky, drawing a Ranger of Ithilien who was committed to the quest. I committed a total of 6 willpower against 4 threat and made 2 progress towards stage 1B.


 


Moving onto the engagement phase I engaged Snaga Scouts and Wolves From Mordor.


 


The Snaga Scouts attacked Beorn, doing no damage before the Wolves From Mordor attacked Beregond, again doing no damage. Beorn counter-attacked, killing the Wolves From Mordor.


 


At the end of the turn I raised my threat to 32.


 


Turn Two began with me adding resources and drawing Eagles Of The Misty Mountains.


 


My planning consisted of paying 2 from Eowyn to play Ethir Swordsman and paying 2 each from Beorn and Beregond to play Eagles of The Misty Mountains.


 


Questing consisted of committed Eowyn, Ethir Swordsman and Ranger of Ithilien. I then drew Captured Watchtower. I committed 8 willpower against 3 threat so 5 progress was added to stage 1B, just enough to explore it and move to stage 2B.


 


In the engagement phase I engaged Wainriders.


 


The Snaga Scouts attacked Beorn, doing no damage before the Wainriders attacked Beregond, doing no damage.


 


Beorn attacked and killed the Wainriders before the Eagles Of The Misty Mountains killed the Snaga Scouts.


 


At the end of the round I raised my threat to 33.


 


Turn Three began with adding resources before I drew another Ethir Swordsman.


 


After skipping planning (and remembering something about taking the first 2 stages slowly on this quest) I committed Eowyn and Ethir Swordsman. I then drew another Wainriders. I managed 6 willpower against 3 threat, putting 3 progress onto stage 2B.


 


In the encounter phase I engaged Wainriders, who attacked Beregond, doing no damage. Beorn attacked and killed the Wainriders.


 


At the end of the turn I raised my threat to 34.


 


Turn Four began with adding resources and drawing Landroval.


 


Due to the restrictions on playing cards in phase 2 I paid 2 from Eowyn to play another Ethir Swordsman (whose ability boosted the other Swordsman in play).


 


Questing consisted of committing Eowyn and both Ethir Swordsmen. I drew Uruk Vanguard. I committed a total of 10 willpower (thanks to the Ethir Swordsman's self-buffing ability) against 3 threat so 7 progress was added to stage 2B, more than enough to explore it and move to stage 3B.


 


After skipping travelling I engaged the Uruk Vanguard, who attacked Beregond, doing no damage. Beorn, Eagles of the Misty Mountains and Ranger Of Ithilien attacked and killed the Uruk Vanguard.


 


At the end of the turn I raised my threat to 35.


 


Turn Five kicked off with my adding resources and drawing The Eagles Are Coming.


 


I started planning by playing The Eagles Are Coming, drawing Landroval, The Eagles Are Coming and Vassal Of The Windlord. I then played the new The Eagles Are Coming, drawing another The Eagles Are Coming. I repeated the process with my last The Eagles Are Coming, drawing Eagles Of The Misty Mountains, Gwalihir and Landroval. I then paid 2 each from Beregond and Beorn to play another Eagles Of The Misty Mountains and paid 1 from Beorn to play Vassal Of The Windlord. I ended a productive phase by playing Horn Of Gondor on Beregond.


 


In the quest phase I discarded the Ranger of Ithilien and committed Eowyn and both Ethir Swordsman. I then drew Emyn-Arnen Overlook. I committed 10 willpower against 3 threat and added 7 progress to stage 3B, exploring it and proceeding to stage 4B, which added the Witch King to the staging area.


 


After travelling to Captured Watchtower I decided to risk optionally engaging the Witch-King. The Witch-King's attack was stopped by my paying 1 from Beregond to play Feint before Beorn, Beregond, Eagles Of The Misty Mountains x2 and Vassal of the Windlord attacked the Witch-King, inflicting 7 damage on the Witch-King. The Vassal Of The Windlord was added as a attachment to one of the Eagles Of The Misty Mountains and added a resource to Beregond.


 


At the end of the turn I decided to raise my threat to a total of 40 and keep the Witch-King engaged with me.


 


Turn Six began with me adding resources before I drew Support of the Eagles (and it's about flipping time).


 


During planning I paid 2 from Beregond and 1 from Beorn to play Support of the Eagles on Beregond.


 


Moving onto questing I committed Eowyn and both Ethir Swordsman (with -1 willpower each). I drew Morgul Duin. I committed 7 total willpower against 3 threat so 2 progress explored Captured Watchtower and 2 progress was added to stage 4B.


 


After skipping travel and encountering the Witch-King attacked Beregond, who exhausted Support Of The Eagles to buff his defence to 7. The shadow card was Cut Off, so I discarded a Gwalihir and the attack did no damage. Beorn and both Eagles of the Misty Mountains (one with a +1 attack buff) attacked and killed the Witch-King.


 


At this point in the proceedings I'm wondering why I ever stopped playing Beorn since he's a monster.


 


At the end of the turn I raised my threat to 41.


 


Turn Seven began with adding resources before I drew my last Ethir Swordsman.


 


During planning I paid 2 from Eowyn to play another Ethir Swordsman.


 


During questing I committed Eagles of The Misty Mountains x2, Eowyn and Ethir Swordsman x3 (supplying 12 willpower between them). I drew Massing At Osgilath, which surged. The surge card was another Morgul Duin, which raised my threat to 42. I committed 20 willpower against 4 threat so 16 progress was added to stage 4B, more than enough to explore it and win the game.


 


This game was more fun than most games I've played recently. Beorn is a monster and the card gods seemed to be on my side.


 


In the end my score was:


Completed turns (6): 60.


Total Threat: 42.


Total Score: 102.

GAME: A SHADOW OF THE PAST.

 

Since I just got my hands on Fog On The Barrow Downs I decided to play through all the quests from the LOTR saga so far.

 

My basic rule for the campaign was that I play for a win, but if I don't pick up the optional boons (or pick up too many burdens) but complete the quest then a win is a win. I won't retry the quest for a optimal result.

 

I decided to use two decks: 

 

The Elven Highborn consists of Celeborn, Elrond and Galadriel with 33 starting threat and a opening hand comprising Arwen Undomiel, Defender Of The Nalth, Elrond's Counsel, Galadhrim Minstrel and Silvan Refugee. Since I didn't get a great hand I decided to mulligan, drawing Children Of The Sea, Elrond's Counsel, Galadriel's Handmaiden, Nalth Guide and Nenya.

 

The Spears Of Mirkwood consists of Haldir Of Lorien, Legolas and Mirlonde with 24 starting threat and a opening hand comprising Elven Mail, Foe-Hammer, Galadhrim Minstrel, Hands Upon The Bow and Rivendell Bow.

 

In addition I added Frodo Baggins into play, with Mr. Underhill and The One Ring.

 

Quest set-up consisted of putting Gandalf's Delay into play, making Bag End the active location and adding a Black Rider to the staging area.

 

Turn One began with The Highborn becoming first player and all heroes gaining resources before the Highborn drew Defender Of The Nalth and the Spears drew Mirkwood Runner.

 

Planning consisted of the Highborn played Nenya on Galadriel [Galadriel -1 (0)] before the Spears played Galadhrim Minstrel [Haldir of Lorien -1 (0), Mirlonde -1 (0)], whose ability added Sudden Strike to the Spears' hand, as well as playing Rivendell Bow on Mirlonde [Legolas -1 (0)].

 

During the quest phase I committed Celeborn (with a willpower buff from Galadriel and Nenya), Frodo Baggins and Galadhrim Minstrel (with a buff from Celeborn). The Highborn drew Have You Seen Baggins, which I decided to pay 1 from Frodo and exhaust The One Ring to reshuffle into the encounter deck. The Highborn's new draw was Woody End. The Spears draw was Gildor Inglorion. I committed 11 willpower against 5 threat. 3 progress explored Bag End and sent it to the victory display as well as allowing the Highborn to draw Lorien Guide. 1 progress explored stage 1B. Stage 2B added another Black Rider to the staging area.

 

After the Fellowship travelled to Woody End the Highborn engaged one of the Black Riders in the staging area.

 

The Black Rider attacked Gildor Inglorion, doing 2 damage. In response, Elrond, Haldir, Legolas and Mirlonde attacked the Black Rider, inflicting enough damage to kill it. Legolas's ability triggered and added 1 progress to Woody End, exploring it and adding 1 more progress to stage 2B.

 

At the end of the turn I discarded Gildor Inglorion and raised the Highborn's threat to 34 and the Spears threat to 25.

 

Turn Two began with the Spears becoming first player and all heroes gaining a resource before the Spears drew another Galadhrim Minstrel and the Highborn drew Galadriel's Handmaiden.

 

During planning the Spears played Galadhrim Minstrel [Haldir -1, Mirlonde -1], whose ability pulled the Tree People into the Spears' hand. The Spears proceeded to play The Tree People and return the Galadhrim Minstrel I played last turn to the Spears' hand to put Silvan Tracker into play. The Highborn played Nalth Guide [Celeborn -2], which made it that Elrond quests without exhausting this turn, and Defender Of The Nalth [Elrond -2, Galadriel -1].

 

Moving to the quest phase I committed Celeborn (buffed by Galadriel and Nenya), Defender Of The Nalth (buffed and questing for free), Elrond (questing for free), Frodo Baggins, Galadhrim Minstrel (buffed), Nalth Guide (buffed and questing for free) and Silvan Tracker (buffed). The Spears drew Evil Crow and the Highborn drew Pathless Country. The Highborn then played Elrond's Counsel on Celeborn to add 1 willpower and drop the Highborn's threat to 31. I committed 17 willpower against 8 threat. 9 progress was added to stage 2B.

 

After the Fellowship travelled to Pathless Country the Highborn optionally engaged Evil Crow, who attacked Defender of the Nalth, doing no damage.

 

Elrond and Legolas attacked and destroyed the Evil Crow. Legolas's ability triggered and added 2 progress to Pathless Country.

 

At the end of the turn I raised the Spears threat to 26 and the Highborn's to 32.

 

Turn Three began with the Highborn becoming first player and the heroes gaining a resource before the Highborn drew Defender Of The Nalth and the Spears drew Pursuing the Enemy.

 

During planning the Highborn played Defender Of The Nalth [Celeborn -1, Elrond -1, Galadriel -1]. The Spears played Galadhrim Minstrel [Haldir -1, Mirlonde -1], who pulled Feint into the Spears' hand.

 

Moving to the quest phase I committed Celeborn (with a buff from Galadriel and Nenya), Defender Of The Nalth (buffed and for free), Frodo Baggins, Galadhrim Minstrel (buffed), Galadhrim Minstrel, Nalth Guide and Silvan Tracker. The Highborn drew Evil Crow and the Spears drew Green Hill Country. I committed 15 willpower against 8 threat. 1 progress explored Pathless Country and 4 more explored stage 2B.

 

Stage 3 added Buckleberry Ferry and another Black Rider to the staging area.

 

After the Fellowship travelled to Green Hill Country the Highborn optionally engaged the Evil Crow and unoptionally engaged a Black Rider.

 

The Evil Crow made  a undefended attack on Celeborn, doing no damage (I've yet to draw a shadow effect this game) before the Black Rider attacked the buffed Defender of the Nalth, killing him.

 

In response Celeborn, Haldir, Legolas and Mirlonde attacked and killed the Black Rider engaged with the Highborn. Legolas's ability added 2 progress to Green Hill Country.

 

At the end of the turn I raised the Highborn's threat to 33 and the Spears' to 27.

 

Turn Four began with the Spears becoming first player and all heroes gaining resources before the Spears drew Henamarth Riversong and the Highborn drew O Lorien.

 

During planning the Spears played Henamarth Riversong [Haldir -1] before the Highborn played O Lorien on Celeborn [Celeborn -1], exhausted O Lorien and played Galadriel's Handmaiden [Galadriel -1], who reduced the Highborn's threat to 32.

 

The quest phase commenced with me committing Celeborn (buffed by Galadriel and Nenya), Frodo Baggins, Galadhrim Minstrel x2, Galadriel's Handmaiden (buffed and for free), Henamarth Riversong (buffed), Nalth Guide and Silvan Tracker. The Spears' draw was Have You Seen Baggins, which I paid 1 from Frodo and exhausted The One Ring to reshuffle into the encounter deck. The replacement was Crawling Towards Them. After exhausting Mirlonde for 3 willpower I drew Bamfurlong and The Ring Draws Them for 2 so passed the Hide test. The Highborn drew Rode Like A Gale, which surged to Black Steed, which surged to Have You Seen Baggins, which attached to Celeborn. I committed 18 willpower against 3 threat. Of the whopping 15 progress I made, 1 blew through Green Hill Country and the other 14 progress was wasted.

 

After travelling to Buckleberry Ferry the Evil Crow attacked the Defender of the Nalth, doing no damage. Elrond and Legolas attacked and killed the Evil Crow, adding 2 progress to Buckleberry Ferry.

 

At the end of the turn I raised the Spears' threat to 28 and the Highborn's to 33.

 

Turn Five began with the Highborn becoming first player and the heroes gaining a resource before the Highborn drew Arwen Undomiel and the Spears drew Mirkwood Runner.

 

During planning the Highborn did nothing and the Spears played Mirkwood Runner [Haldir -1, Mirlonde -2].

 

At this point I decided to risk going all in. I committed Celeborn (buffed by Galadriel and Nenya), Elrond, Frodo, Galadhrim Minstrel x2, Galadriel's Handmaiden, Haldir, Henamarth Riversong, Legolas, Mirkwood Runner (buffed), Mirlonde, Nalth Guide and Silvan Tracker. Deck #1 drew Stock Road and deck #2 drew Green Hill Country. I committed 26 willpower against 5 threat. The 21 progress I made blow straight through the 7 progress I needed and won the game.

 

These decks worked well (for 2 decks almost completely lifted from a article on the site). At the end of the game I opted to add the Boon Mr. Underhill and the Burden The Ring Draws Them to the campaign pool.

 

In the end my score was:

Completed turns (4): 40

Total Threat: 61.

VP: 1.

Total Score: 100.

A SHADOW OF THE PAST

 

After trying out some other deck designs and getting nowhere I decided to go back to the two decks from the Elven Realms Unite articles and try the whole shebang again. The two decks managed to slog through a fourteen turn game (I was writing it up but had enough about turn 12). At the end of the game I added The Ring Draws Them and Mr. Underhill to the campaign pool.

THE OLD FOREST

Heroes: Celeborn, Elrond and Galadriel & Haldir of Lorien, Legolas and Mirlonde. The decks are here: https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/133239-my-solo-decks/ [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/133239-my-solo-decks/]

 

I seemed to hit lucky with this game. I managed to get (between the two decks) O Lorien and 2 Daughters Of The Nimrodel in the opening hand so keeping heroes alive was less of a problem than I usually had. In the end I had enough questers and attackers in play by the time I hit stage 3 to take the hits on one turn, do enough damage and quest through on the next turn.

 

I managed to do enough damage to add Old Bogey-Stories.

GAME: INTRUDERS IN CHETWOOD.


 


My choice of heroes was Eomer, Eowyn and Theoden (Spirit) for 31 opening threat and a hand containing Escort From Edoras, Firefoot, Guthlaf x2, West Road Traveller and Westfold Outrider.


 


Quest set-up consisted of putting Iarion into play under my control before adding Orc War Party and Shrouded Hills to the staging area.


 


Turn One began with adding a resource to my heroes before I drew Hama.


 


My planning consisted of paying 1 from Eowyn to play Escort From Edoras.


 


I committted Eowyn, Escort From Edoras and Iarion before I drew Chetwood Forest. I committed 9 willpower against 7 threat so 2 progress was added to stage 1B.


 


After I travelled to Shrouded Hills I ended the turn by raising my threat to 33.


 


Turn Two began with adding resources before I drew Westfold Horse-Breaker.


 


During planning I paid 2 from Eomer to play Firefoot on him and paid 1 from Eowyn to play West Road Traveller, swapping the active Shrouded Hills with Chetwood Forest from the staging area before paying 2 from Theoden to play Westfold Horse-Breaker.


 


I committed Eowyn, Escort From Edoras, Iarion and West Road Traveller before I drew Angmar Captain. I committed 11 against 7 threat so 3 progress explored Chetwood Forest and 1 progress was added to stage 1B.


 


After travelling back to Shrouded Hills I opted to engage the Orc War Party and feed the Westfold Horse-Breaker to it. The shadow card was Border Of Breeland, which added 1 attack and made the kill even more OTT. The kill buffed Eomer, who attacked the Orc War Party with Theoden and killed the Orc War Party.


 


With a big problem removed I ended the turn by raising my threat to 35.


 


Turn Three began with adding resources before I drew Mustering The Rohirrim.


 


I paid 1 from Eowyn to play Mustering The Rohirrim and put another Escort From Edoras into hand before paying 1 from Theoden to play the Escort From Edoras.


 


I committed Eowyn, Escort From Edoras x2 and Iarion before drawing Surprising Spped, raising my threat to 36 before surging to Borders Of Breeland. I committed 13 against 5 threat so 5 progress explores Shrouded Hills and another 3 progress is added to stage 1B.


 


After I travelled to Borders Of Breeland I engaged the Angmar Captain who attacked the West Road Traveller. The shadow card was Outlying Homestead which did nothing so the Angmar Captain killed the West Road Traveller and buffed Eomer. The Angmar Captain's ability triggered and discarded Helm! Helm, doing nothing before Eomer and Theoden attacked and killed the Angmar Captain.


 


At the end of the turn I raised my threat to 38.


 


Turn Four began with adding resources before I drew Unexpected Courage.


 


I paid 1 each from Eowyn and Theoden to play Hama before paying 2 from Eomer to play Guthlaf.


 


I committed Eomer, Eowyn, Escort From Edoras x2, Guthlaf, Hama, Iarion and Theoden before I drew Rugged Country. I committed 18 against 2 threat so 4 progress explored Border Of Breeland and 12 progress was added to stage 1B.


 


I ended the turn by raising my threat to 40.


 


Turn Five began with adding resources before I drew Eomund.


 


I paid 1 from Eowyn and Theoden to play Eomund.


 


During the quest phase I committed Eomer, Eomund, Eowyn, Escort From Edoras x2, Guthlaf, Hama, Iarion and Theoden before I drew Lost In The Wilderness, putting my hand under it. I committed 20 willpower against 4 threat so the 16 progress I made was more than enough to explore stage 1B and win the game.


 


This deck was a success, mostly (I suspect) due to a good quality of card draw. My final score was:


 


Completed Turns (4): 40.


Total Threat: 40.


Total Score: 80.

Unfortunately you played this quest incorrectly. The baleful shades start the game engaged with players and you had it begin in staging and did not engage it till the second turn. Baleful Shade and Cursed Dead attacking first turn together (especially if the shade got buffed by its effect) would have been harder to deal with so may have changed the outcome somewhat.

I noticed the mistake after I'd finished the game (and posted the report) and I think I made more mistakes as well. SInce there is a new saga box coming out I will need to work out a deck without Frodo I'm going to give the Lost Realm/Angmar Awakens quests a go with a two new decks (I try to quit playing two-handed but they keep dragging me back in. Two-handed is more interesting than solo).

SHADOW OF THE PAST (CAMPAIGN 1).

Deck #1: Merry (Spirit), Pippin (Lore) and Sam Gamgee.

Deck #2: Aragorn (Tactics), Gimli and Legolas.

 

I was typing this up as a full report but, to be honest, I was sick of repeating the same activities each turn (quest with all of deck #1, draw at least one location, remove one location then repeat) so I opted out on turn 9 (then finished in two rounds, doh!). The two decks worked well together (Merry didn't get to use his ability much because I had enough allies out for deck #2 to deal with all the enemies who turned up) but regardless I managed to pull off a win. I ended the game by adding Mr. Underhill and Gandalf's Delay to the campaign log.

 

The final combined score was: 

Completed turns (9): 90.

Combined Threat: 56.

Dead Hero Threat: 0.

Damage on surviving heroes: 0.

VP: 1.

Total Score: 145.

THE OLD FOREST (CAMPAIGN 2).

Deck #1: Merry (Spirit), Pippin (Lore) and Sam Gamgee.

Deck #2: Aragorn (Tactics), Gimli and Legolas.

 

This game was a slog. The two decks worked well (getting Northern Tracker, Lorien Guide and Steward of Gondor in deck #1's opening hand was a big help) and after inflicgting 20 damage on Old Man Willow in one turn I managed enough damage to gain Old Bogey-Stories as a boon.

GAME: A SHADOW OF THE PAST (CAMPAIGN 1)


 


After playing eight attempts at Fog On The Barrow Downs and failing spectacularly I decided to try a pair of decks which, while less thematics, pack a bit more power than the decks I was using.


 


Deck #1 comprised Elrond, Gandalf and Glorfindel (Spirit) with 32 threat and a opening hand (after a mulligan) containing Gandalf's Staff, Miner Of The Iron Hills, Northern Tracker, Shadowfax and Smoke Rings.


 


Deck #2 comprised Aragorn (Tactics), Elladan and Elrohir with 32 threat and a post-mulligan hand containing Defender Of Rammas x2, Feint, Honour Guard and Ranger Provisions.


 


Quest set-up consisted of playing Frodo Baggins (carrying Mr. Underhill and The One Ring) attached to the first player, playing Gandalf's Delay and making Bag End the active location before adding a Black Rider to the staging area.


 


TURN ONE.


RESOURCE PHASE.


Deck #1 become first player before I added a resource to each hero. Deck #1 drew A Burning Brand (replacing it with Waters Of The Nimrodel) and deck #2 drew Sword That Was Broken.


 


PLANNING PHASE.


Deck #1 paid 1 from Elrond, Gandalf and Glorfindel to play Shadowfax on Gandalf and before Deck #2 paid 1 from Aragorn and Elladan to play Defender Of Rammas.


 


QUEST PHASE.


Elrond, Frodo, Gandalf (readying with Shadowfax) and Glorfindel (raising deck #1's threat to 33) committed to the quest before deck #1 drew Evil Crow and deck #2 drew Green Hill Country. I committed 11 against 8 threat so 3 progress was added to Bag End, exploring it and sending it to the victory display before deck #1 drew Waters Of The Nimrodel (replacing it with Daughter Of The Nimrodel).


 


TRAVEL PHASE.


The Fellowship travelled to Green Hill Country.


 


ENCOUNTER PHASE.


Deck #2 optionally engaged the Evil Crow.


 


COMBAT PHASE.


The Evil Crow attacked Defender Of The Nalth, drawing Lure Of The Ring (for +1 attack) and still doing no damage.


Elladan attacked and killed the Evil Crow.


Aragorn's ability triggered so the Black Rider engaged deck #2.


Aragorn and Elrohir attacked the Black Rider, inflicting 2 damage.


 


REFRESH PHASE.


After refreshing all cards deck #1's threat increased to 34 and deck #2's increased to 33.

QUEST PHASE.


Elrond, Frodo, Gandalf (readying with Shadowfax) and Henamarth Riversong committed to the quest before deck #2 drew Black Rider (which deck #2 exhausted The One Ring and paid 1 from Frodo to shuffle back into the encounter deck) before drawing Evil Crow and deck #1 drew Bamfurlong. I committed 9 against 4 threat so 3 progress was added to Green Hill Country, exploring so each of deck #2's heroes gained a resource. Another 2 progress was added to stage 1B, exploring it. Stage 2 added a Black Rider to the staging area.


 


TRAVEL PHASE.


The Fellowship travelled to Bamfurlong.


 


ENCOUNTER PHASE.

PLANNING PHASE.


Deck #1 paid 2 from Elrond to play Asfaloth on Glorfindel and paid 1 from Gandalf to play Westfold Horse-Breeder (replacing her with another Westfold Horse-Breeder) before her ability bombed and I reshuffled the deck (the new top card was Miner Of The Iron Hills). Deck #2 paid 2 from Aragorn to play Defender Of Rammas and paid 2 from Elladan to play Honour Guard before paying 1 from Elrohir to play Ranger Provisions on the active Bamfurlong.


Deck #1 exhausted Asfaloth to put 2 progress to the active Bamfurlong, exploring it. The Ranger Provisions triggered, adding 1 resource to each of deck #1's heroes before deck #1 exhausted Gandalf's Staff to add 1 resource to Glorfindel.


 


QUEST PHASE.


Elrond, Frodo Baggins, Gandalf (refreshing with Shadowfax), Henamarth Riversong and Westfold Horse-Breeder committed before deck #1 drew Black Rider (which deck #1 paid 1 from Frodo and exhausted the One Ring to shuffle back into the encounter deck) before drawing Green Hill Country.

Deck #1 paid 4 from Glorfindel to play Northern Tracker before exhausting Gandalf's Staff to add 1 resource to Elrond and paying 3 from Elrond to play Daughter Of The Nimrodel. Deck #1 ended a busy phase by playing Gather Information (replacing it with Waters Of The Nimrodel).


 


QUEST PHASE.


I opted to quest through Gather Information before Daughter Of The Nimrodel, Elrond, Frodo Baggins, Gandalf (refreshing with Shadowfax), Henamarth Riversong, Northern Tracker (adding 1 progress to Green Hill Country) and Westfold Horse-Breeder committed. Deck #2 drew Crawling Towards Him (exhausting Aragorn, Elladan and Elrohir for 6 willpower before drawing Stock Road and Lure Of The Ring for 3 threat so passing the hide test) before deck #1 drew Pathless Country. Deck #1 exhausted Asfaloth to add 2 progress to the active Stock Road.

Deck #1 drew Rode Like A Gale, which returned the Black Rider to the staging area and surged to Green Hill Country before deck #2 drew Pathless Country. I committed 30 willpower against 9 threat. 21 progress was more than enough to blow through Buckleberry Ferry and complete the quest.


 


These decks seemed to work better than the last two decks I used. In the end my score was:


 


Completed Turns (6): 60.


Total Threat: 77.


VP: 3.


Total Score: 134.


 


I added the boon Mr. Underhill and the burden The Ring Draws Them to the Campaign Pool.

QUEST PHASE.


I committed Aragorn, Celador, Frodo Baggins and Glorfindel (raising my threat to 25) before I drew Ithilien Guardian. I committed 11 against 3 in the staging area so 4 progress explored Ithilien Road and 4 progress was added to stage 1B.

I committed 12 against 3 in the staging area so 9 progress was added to stage 3B, more than enough to explore it and move onto stage 4B.


 


TRAVEL PHASE.


No travel.


 


ENCOUNTER PHASE.


I opted to engage the Southron Mercenaries and Southron Company.


 


COMBAT PHASE.


The archery damage raised my threat to 25 before the Southron Mercenaries attacked Frodo, drawing Mordor Spider for no effect before the attack did nothing.


The Southron Patrol attacked Frodo, drawing Overgrown Trail for no effect before the attack raised my threat to 28.

I committed 22 against 4 threat so 18 progress was more than enough to explore stage 4B and win the game.


 


This game was more fun than I expected. The three heroes work well together (and after I remember to put Asfaloth into the deck it'll probably work better).


 


My final score was:


Completed turns (7): 70.


Total Threat: 29.


Total Score: 99.

GAME: THE SIEGE OF CAIR ANDROS.


 


I opted to go back to playing two-handed.


 


Deck #1 was Beravor, Haldir of Lorien and Idraen with 30 threat and a opening hand containing Bombur, Fair And Perilous, Gandalf (Core), Ranger Of Cardolan, Unexpected Courage and Wingfoot.


 


Deck #2 was Aragorn (Tactics), Elladan and Elrohir with 32 threat and a opening hand (after a mulligan) containing Dagger Of Westernesse, Dunedain Hunter, Feint, Honour Guard, Steward Of Gondor and Weather Hills Watchman.


 


Quest set-up consisted of adding The Approach, The Bank and The Citadel to the staging area.


 


TURN ONE.


RESOURCE PHASE.


After adding resources [Aragorn +1, Beravor +1, Elladan +1, Elrohir +1, Haldir +1 and Idraen +1] deck #1 drew Erebor Hammersmith and deck #2 drew Defender Of Rammas.


 


PLANNING PHASE.


Deck #1 played Wingfoot on Elrohir [beravor -1] before deck #2 played Dunedain Hunter (putting Orc Rabble into play engaged with deck #2) and played Defender Of Rammas [Aragorn -1, Elladan -1].


 


QUEST PHASE.


I committed Beravor, Defender Of Rammas, Elrohir (naming Enemy for Wingfoot), Haldir and Idraen.


I drew Southron Mercenaries (which readied Elrohir) and Orc Scramblers (which added 1 damage to The Approach, The Bank and The Citadel), which surged to Orc Arbalester.


I committed 11 against 11 threat so no progress was made.


 


TRAVEL PHASE.


Travelled to The Bank.


 


ENCOUNTER PHASE.


Deck #2 engaged Orc Scramblers.


 


COMBAT PHASE.


Archery inflicted 1 damage each on Beravor, Haldir, Idraen, Aragorn, Elladan and Elrohir.


Orc Scramblers attack Elrohir, drawing Orc Vanguard, which made me draw Southron Mercenaries (for +1 attack) and Battering Ram (which added 2 damage to the Approach). The attack did no damage.


Elrohir readied [Elrohir -1].


Orc Rabble attack Elrohir, drawing The Master's Malice, for no effect. The attack did no damage.


Elladan attacked the Orc Scramblers, killing them.


Aragorn attacked the Orc Rabble, killing them.


Aragorn's ability forced the Southron Mercenaries to engage deck #2.


Dunedain Hunter and Haldir attacked and killed the Southron Mercenaries.


 


REFRESH PHASE.


After refreshing all cards I raised deck #1's threat to 31 and deck #2's to 33.


 


TURN TWO.


RESOURCE PHASE.


After adding resources [Aragorn +1, Beravor +1, Elladan +1, Elrohir +1, Haldir +1 and Idraen +1] deck #2 drew Faramir and deck #1 drew Steed Of Imladris.


 


PLANNING PHASE.


Deck #2 played Honour Guard [Aragorn -1, Elladan -1] before deck #1 played Unexpected Courage on Aragorn [idraen -2] and played Bombur [beravor -1, Haldir -2].


 


QUEST PHASE.


I committed Aragorn (readying with Unexpected Courage), Beravor, Bombur, Defender Of Rammas, Dunedain Hunter, Elrohir (naming Enemy for Wingfoot) and Idraen.


Draw #1 was The Power Of Mordor (which shuffled Orc Arbalester, The Approach and The Citadel into the encounter deck).


Draw #1.1 was Lieutenant Of Mordor.


Draw 1.2 was The Master's Malice (which added 3 damage to Idraen, killing her, and Elrohir, killing him).


At this point in the proceedings, with 2 heroes dead on turn two, I decided to call it quits.


 


I think I'm going to go back to the drawing board and probably go with two mono-sphere decks since The Master's Malice is going to be a serious problem in this quest.

QUEST: A SHADOW OF THE PAST.

 

Heroes: Beravor, Haldir of Lorien and Idraen & Aragorn (Tactics), Halbarad and Hama.

 

I was writing a full game report but (again) got sick of writing up the same thing each turn. The two decks worked well (Hama is invaluable in keeping the big threats at bay) and the quest was completed in 10 turns. I added The Ring Draws Them and Mr. Underhill to the campaign log.

GAME: THE OLD FOREST.

 

I used the same heroes as last time in a practice game to work the kinks out of the two decks. Things went surprisingly well, once again the Outlands allies quested like crazy and I motored through to stage 3 when everythinng went wrong. 

 

With dead allies littering the forest I was stuck in a position where the only Hero in a position to defend deck A was Hirluin (as the only Deck A hero with more than 1 wound remaining). I gambled on getting a shadow card which didn't raise attack since I had 2 of Anfalas Herdsman in play. Unfortunately I drew a bad enough card combo to kill him. Legolas proceeded to kill a Grasping Root and his bonus progress won the game.

 

In the end I managed to eke out a win but the death of Hirluin leaves me with a large amount of rebuilding for deck A and a difficult choice of which hero to replace Hirluin with.

GAME: INTRUDERS IN CHETWOOD.


 


I opted to go back to playing true solo, using a deck containing Aragorn (Lore), Frodo Baggins and Glorfindel for 24 threat and a opening hand containing A Test Of Will, Gandalf (Core), Light Of Valinor, Northern Tracker, Will of The West and Wingfoot.


 


Quest set-up consisted of adding Iarion under my control and adding Orc War Party and Shrouded Hills to the staging area.


 


Turn One started with adding a resource to each of my heroes and drawing Warden Of Healing before I paid 1 from Aragorn to play Wingfoot on him and paid 1 from Glorfindel to play Light Of Valinor on him.


 


I committed Aragorn (naming Enemy for Wingfoot), Frodo, Glorfindel (without exhausting) and Iarion before I drew Angmar Marauder, which readied Aragorn thanks to Wingfoot. I committed 8 against 7 threat so 1 progress was added to stage 1B.


 


I opted to travel to Shrouded Hills, then optionally engaged the Angmar Marauder.


 


The Angmar Marauder made a undefended attack against Frodo, drawing Sudden Assault for no effect before the attack raised my threat to 27 and Aragorn and Glorfindel attacked and killed the Angmar Marauder.


 


I ended the turn by readying all my cards and raising my threat to 29.


 


Turn Two began with adding a resource to all my heroes before I drew Unexpected Courage.


 


I committed Aragorn (naming Enemy for Wingfoot), Frodo, Glorfindel (without exhausting) and Iarion before I drew Weight Of Responsibility, which forced me to draw Rugged Country. I committed 8 willpower against 5 threat so 3 progress was added to Shrouded Hills.


 


After skipping travelling, engaging and combat I readied all my cards and raised my threat to 31.


 


Turn Three began with my adding a resource to all my heroes before I drew Galadhrim Minstrel. I proceeded to pay 2 from Aragorn to play Galadhrim Minstrel (who added Elrond's Counsel to my hand) and paid 2 each from Frodo and Glorfindel to play Northern Tracker.


 


I committed Aragorn (naming Enemy for Wingfoot), Galadhrim Minstrel, Glorfindel (without exhausting), Iarion and Northern Tracker (adding 1 resource to Rugged Country) before I drew Angmar Captain (which readied Aragorn). I played Elrond's Counsel to add 1 willpower to Aragorn and lower my threat to 28. I committed 9 against 8 threat so 1 progress was added to Shrouded Hills.


 


After skipping travel I opted to engage Angmar Captain, who attacked Frodo, drawing Angmar Orc for 1 extra attack so my threat was raised to 32. Aragorn and Glorfindel attacked the Angmar Captain for 4 damage.


 


At the end of the round I readied all my cards before I raised my threat to 34.


 


Turn Four began with adding a resource to my heroes and drew Westfold Horse-Breeder before I paid 1 from Frodo to play Westfold Horse-Breeder (who added Asfaloth to my hand) before paying 1 each from Frodo and Glorfindel to play Unexpected Courage on Aragorn.


 


I committed Aragorn (naming Enemy for Wingfoot), Galadhrim Minstrel, Glorfindel (without exhausting), Iarion, Northern Tracker (adding 1 resource to Rugged Country) and Westfold Horse-Breeder before I drew Chetwood Forest. I committed 9 against 8 threat so 1 progress was added to Shrouded Hills, exploring it.


 


After skipping the travel and encounter phases I exhausted Unexpected Courage to ready Aragorn before the Angmar Captain attacked Frodo, drawing Angmar Orc for 1 extra damage so the attack raised my threat to 38 before Aragorn and Glorfindel attacked and killed the Angmar Captain.


 


I ended the turn by readying my cards and raising my threat to 40.


 


Turn Five began with adding a resource to my heroes before I drew Elrond's Counsel, paid 2 from Aragorn to play Asfaloth on Glorfindel.


 


I committed Aragorn (naming Enemy for Wingfoot), Galadhrim Minstrel, Glorfindel (without exhausting), Iarion, Northern Tracker (adding 1 progress to Chetwood Forest and Rugged Country, exploring Rugged Country) and Westfold Horse-Breeder. I exhausted Asfaloth to add 2 progress to Chetwood Forest and explore it and played Elrond's Counsel to add 1 willpower to Aragorn and reduce my threat to 37 before I drew Surprising Speed, which raised my threat to 38 and surged to Angmar Marauder (which readied Aragorn). I committed 9 against 6 so another 3 progress was added to stage 1B.


 


After skipping travelling I engaged the Angmar Marauder who attacked Frodo, drawing Pressing Needs for no effect. The attack raised my threat to 39 before Aragorn and Glorfindel killed the Angmar Marauder.


 


At the end of the turn I readied my cards before raising my threat to 41.

> I keep a spreadsheet of my victories and losses, so I've got a record of almost every game I've ever played... right now it's sitting at 355, and I've been playing for just over two years.  So 200 a year is not in my league and this is a goal I can root for -- go for it silverthorn!

 

 

Any possibility of sharing that spreadsheet?

GAME: PASSAGE THROUGH MIRKWOOD (PROGRESSION).

 

Heroes: Denethor, Eowyn and Legolas.

 

I decided to try all the quests in the game only using cards available at the time the quest came out. This quest was a slog thanks to the obvious low amount of cards available but I managed to get a win in first time with the deck.

## 335 [silverthorn on February 24, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=2068188)

GAME: JOURNEY DOWN THE ANDUIN (PROGRESSION).

 

Heroes: Denethor, Eowyn and Legolas.

 

If I thought the last quest was a slog this one was ridiculous. I managed to slog out a win after 19 completed rounds (and a score of 221).

## 336 [silverthorn on February 28, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=2075366)

GAME: ESCAPE FROM DOL GOLDUR (PROGRESSION).

 

Heroes: Denethor, Eowyn and Legolas.

 

It took me 14 (or more, I gave up keeping count) attempts to beat Dol Goldur solo with just cards from the Core set. I hit lucky with Legolas being the captive and three Treachery on the objectives. I managed to complete the game, although Denethor was killed on the way. At least I can progress from here now.

GAME: HUNT FOR GOLLUM (PROGRESSION)

 

Heroes: Denethor, Eowyn and Gimli.

 

Swapping out Legolas for Gimli seems to have improved the deck somewhat. I managed a first attempt win with minimal problems.

GAME: CONFLICT AT THE CARROCK (PROGRESSION).

Heroes: Aragorn (Leadership), Denethor and Eowyn.

 

This deck worked well sincegood early draws left me with Denethor with 3 Dunedain Warnings, 3 Unexpected COurages and a Burning Brand so he could defend all day long against the trolls while Aragorn and Grimbeorn killed them.

LORD OF THE RINGS SAGA CAMPAIGN #1: THE SHADOW OF THE PAST (ATTEMPT ONE)


 


I decided to give the saga campaign another go (since I think two box sets have come out since the last time).


 


Deck #1 was Beravor, Eleanor and Idraen, with 28 threat and a opening hand containing A Burning Brand, Henamarth Riversong, Self-Preservation, Song Of Wisdom and Warden of Arnor.


 


Deck #2 was Aragorn (Tactics), Halbarad and Sam Gamgee with 30 threat and a opening hand containing Celebrian's Stone, Defender Of Rammas, Dunedain Warning, Galadhon Archer and Ranger Summons.


 


Set-Up for the quest consisted of adding a Black Rider to the staging area and making Bag End the active location before putting Gandalf's Delay into play. I then added Frodo Baggins (with Mr Underhill and The One Ring), under the control of deck #1.


 


Turn One began with deck #1 becoming first player before each hero gained a resource, deck #1 drew Fast Hitch and deck #2 drew Guardian Of Arnor.


 


During planning deck #1 paid 1 from Idraen to play Warden of Arnor on her and paid 1 from Beravor to play Fast Hitch on Sam Gamgee. Deck #2 paid 1 from Halbarad to play Dunedain Warning on him and paid 1 from Sam Gamgee to play Ranger Summons, shuffling a Ranger Of The North into the encounter deck.


 


I committed Beravor, Frodo Baggins, Idraen and Sam Gamgee to the quest before deck #1 drew Stock Road (which Warden of Arnor added 1 progress to) and deck #2 drew Black Rider, which Frodo Baggins exhausted the One Ring and paid 1 to reshuffle back into the encounter deck before drawing Pathless Country. I commuted 9 willpower against 9 threat so no progress was made.


 


At the end of the turn I refreshed all cards before raising deck #1's threat to 29 and deck #2's to 31.


 


Turn Two began with deck #2 becoming first player before each hero gained a resource, deck #2 drew Galadhon Archer and deck #1 drew Wingfoot.


 


During planning deck #2 paid 1 from Halbarad and Sam Gamgee to play Celebrian's Stone on Aragorn and paid 2 from Aragorn to play Defender Of Rammas. Deck #1 paid 1 from Beravor to play Song Of Wisdom on Idraen before paying 1 from Idraen to play Wingfoot on Aragorn.


 


I committed Aragorn (naming Enemy for Wingfoot), Beravor, Frodo Baggins, Idraen and Sam Gamgee before deck #2 drew Ranger Of The North (which attached to deck #2 and added 2 progress to Stock Road, exploring it) and deck #1 drew Evil Crow (which readied Aragorn). I committed 13 willpower against 8 threat so 3 progress explored Bag End (sending it to the victory display and allowing deck #2 to draw Sneak Attack and Honour Guard) and 1 progress explored stage 1B. Stage 2 added another Black Rider to the staging area.


 


The fellowship opted to travel to Pathless Country.


 


Deck #2 engaged the Evil Crow (which readied and buffed Sam Gamgee) who attacked the Defender Of Rammas. The shadow card was The Ring Draws Them for no effect so the attack did no damage before Aragorn attacked and killed the Evil Crow. Aragorn's ability triggered to force a Black Rider to engage deck #2. After readying Sam Gamgee with Fast Hitch, Halbarad, Ranger of the North and Sam Gamgee attacked the Black Rider, doing 2 damage.


 


At the end of the turn I refreshed everything before deck #2's threat increased to 32 and deck #1's increased to 30.


 


Turn Three began with deck #1 becoming first player before each hero gained a resource, deck #1 drew The Evening Star and deck #2 drew Gondorian Shield.


 


During planning deck #2 paid 1 from Aragorn to play Gondorian Shield on Halbarad.


 


I committed Beravor, Frodo Baggins, Halbarad (without exhausting), Idraen and Sam Gamgee before deck #1 drew Green Hill Country (which gained a progress from Warden Of Arnor) and deck #2 drew Black Steed, which I added to the Black Rider engaged with deck #2. I committed 11 willpower against 6 threat so 3 progress explored Pathless Country and 2 progress was added to stage 2B.


 


After the Fellowship travelled to Green Hill Country, the Black Rider attacked Defender Of Rammas. The shadow card was Green Hill Country so the attack overkilled the Defender of Rammas.


After readying Sam with Fast Hitch Aragorn, Halbarad, Ranger Of The North and Sam Gamgee attacked and killed the Black Rider. Aragorn's ability forced the Black Rider in the staging area to engage deck #2.


 


At the end of the turn I readied everything before deck #1's threat increased to 31 and deck #2 increased to 33.


 


Turn Four began with deck #2 becoming first player before I added a resource to each hero, deck #2 drew Gandalf (Core) and deck #1 drew The Evening Star.


 


During planning deck #2 paid 1 from Halbarad and 2 from Sam to play Guardian Of Arnor. Deck #1 paid 1 from Idraen to play Henamarth Riversong and paid 1 from Idraen and 2 from Beravor to play Self-Preservation on Halbarad.


 


Deck #1 exhausted Henamarth Riversong, who looked at the top card of the deck, Stock-Brook, and returned it to the top of the deck.


 


I committed Aragorn (naming Location for Wingfoot), Beravor, Frodo Baggins, Halbarad (without exhausting), Idraen and Sam Gamgee before deck #2 drew Stock-Brook (which replaced Green Hill Country as active location, gained a progress from Warden Of Arnor and readied Aragorn) and deck #1 drew Lure Of The Ring, which exhausted the One Ring and surged to Pathless Country. I committed 15 against 5 threat so 4 progress explored Stock-Brook and sent it to the victory display before 6 progress was added to stage 1B. Deck #2 used Fast Hitch to ready Sam Gamgee.


 


After the Fellowship travelled to Green Hill Country deck #2 paid 1 from Halbarad to Sneak Attack Gandalf into play, who added 4 damage to the Black Rider before the Black Rider attacked Gandalf. The shadow card was Hunting for the Ring, for no effect so the attack did 1 damage. Aragorn, Halbarad, Ranger Of The North and Sam Gamgee attacked and killed the Black Rider before Gandalf returned to deck #2's hand.


 


I ended the turn by refreshing everything before deck #2's threat increased to 34 and deck #1's increased to 32.


 


Turn Five began with deck #1 becoming first player before I added a resource to each hero, deck #1 drew Arwen Undomiel and deck #2 drew Nalth Guide.


 


During planning deck #1 paid 2 from Eleanor to play Arwen Undomiel. Deck #2 paid 2 from Aragorn to play Honour Guard and paid 1 each from Halbarad and Sam Gamgee to play Nalth Guide (who made it so that Sam Eleanor could quest without exhausting).


 


Henamarth Riversong exhausted to look at the top card of the encounter deck, Lure Of The Ring, and return it to the top of the encounter deck.


 


I committed Aragorn (naming Treachery for Wingfoot), Arwen Undomiel (adding 1 defence to Halbarad), Beravor, Eleanor (without exhausting), Frodo Baggins, Idraen, Nalth Guide and Sam Gamgee before deck #1 drew Lure Of The Ring (which forced deck #1 to exhaust the One Ring but readied Aragorn), which surged to Evil Crow before deck #2 drew Rode Like A Gale, which surged to Bamfurlong (which gained a progress from Warden Of Arnor). I committed 17 willpower against 6 threat so 2 progress was added to Green Hill Country, exploring it and 9 progress was added to stage 2B, exploring it. Stage 3 added Buckleberry Ferry and another Black Rider to the staging area.


 


After the Fellowship travelled to Bamfurlong the Evil Crow engaged deck #2 (readying and buffing Sam Gamgee) and attacked the Guardian of Arnor. The shadow card was Black Rider, for no effect, and the attack did no damage. Aragorn struck back and killed the Evil Crow, then used his ability to force the Black Rider to engage deck #2. where Halbarad, Ranger Of The North and Sam Gamgee attacked it, inflicting 3 damage.


 


At the end of the turn I refreshed everything, then raised deck #1's threat to 33 and deck #2's to 35.


 


Turn Six began with deck #2 becoming first player and each hero gaining a resource before deck #2 drew another Gondorian Shield and deck #1 drew Northern Tracker.


 


Moving onto the planning phase deck #1 paid 4 from Eleanor to play Northern Tracker.


 


Henamarth Riversong exhausted to look at the top card of the encounter deck, The Marish, before returning it to the top of the deck.


 


I committed Aragorn (naming Location for Wingfoot), Arwen Undomiel (adding 1 defence to Guardian Of Arnor), Beravor, Frodo Baggins, Idraen, Nalth Guide, Northern Tracker (adding 1 progress to Pathless Country and Buckleberry Ferry) and Sam Gamgee before deck #2 drew The Marish (which added 1 progress from Warden Of Arnor) and deck #1 drew Black Steed (which was added to the Black Rider engaged with deck #2). I committed 17 willpower against 8 threat so 1 progress explored Bamfurlong.


 


Deck #1 paid 2 from Beravor to play The Evening Star to add 2 progress to Pathless Country (exploring it and readying Idraen), then paid 2 from Idraen to play another The Evening Star to add 2 progress (twice) to The Marish to explore it.


 


With no more locations in play the Fellowship travelled to The Buckleberry Ferry.


 


The Black Rider attacked the Guardian Of Arnor. The shadow card was Have You Seen Baggins for no effect so the attack did 2 damage. In response, Aragorn, Halbarad, Ranger Of The North and Sam Gamgee attacked and killed the Black Rider.


 


I ended the turn by refreshing everything before I raised deck #2's threat to 36 and deck #1's to 34.


 


Turn Seven began with deck #1 becoming first player and each hero gaining a resource before deck #1 drew The Evening Star and deck #2 drew Galadriel.


 


During planning deck #2 paid 2 from Halbarad and 1 from Sam Gamgee to play Galadriel, who played Sword That Was Broken on Aragorn.


 


Moving onto the quest phase (and knowing that a big push will be needed to complete the game this turn) I committed everyone to the quest before deck #1 drew Gildor Inglorion and deck #2 drew Green Hill Country. I committed a grand total of 34 willpower against 2 threat. Oddly enough, 32 progress was enough to explore Buckleberry Ferry and win the game.


 


At the end of the game I chose to add The Ring Draws Them and Mr. Underhill to the Campaign Pool.

After playing this (and beating my head against the brick wall which is the Old Forest) I realised that I forgot to do the Hide 3 test to travel to Buckleberry Ferry. The ridiculous thing is that I don't think it's the first time I've done it in a written up quest attempt.

## 341 [silverthorn on March 28, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=2128683)

LORD OF THE RINGS SAGA CAMPAIGN #2: THE OLD FOREST (ATTEMPT THREE)


 


After two attempts ended in early location locks I opted to change the two decks.


 


Deck #1 was Beravor, Eleanor and Idraen, with 28 threat and a opening hand containing Arwen Undomiel, Miner Of The Iron Hills, Northern Tracker, Song Of Travel, Warden of Arnor and Wingfoot.


 


Deck #2 was Aragorn (Tactics), Halbarad and Sam Gamgee with 30 threat and a opening hand containing Arod, Defender Of Rammas, Ranger Summons, Steward Of Gondor, Sword That Was Broken and Weather Hills Watchman.


 


Set-Up for the quest consisted of putting Frodo Baggins (with Mr Underhill and The One Ring) into play under the control of deck #1, adding Misleading Path and Wall of Trees to the staging area, deck #1 drawing Song Of Wisdom and deck #2 drawing Dunedain Hunter before advancing to Choked With Brambles. I then attached Old Bogey-Stories to Sam Gamgee.


 


Turn One began with deck #2 becoming first player and each hero gaining a resource before deck #2 drew Sword That Was Broken and deck #1 drew Escort From Edoras.


 


During planning deck #2 paid 1 each from Halbarad and Sam Gamgee to play Steward Of Gondor on Idraen, then paid 1 from Aragorn to play Arod on himself and played Dunedain Hunter, who brought a Army Of Flies into play engaged with deck #2.


 


After exhausting Steward Of Gondor to add 2 resources to Idraen, deck #1 paid 3 from Idraen and 1 from Eleanor to play Northern Tracker, then paid 1 from Beravor to play Wingfoot on Aragorn.


 


Moving to the quest phase I committed Aragorn (naming Location for Wingfoot), Beravor, Frodo Baggins, Idraen, Northern Tracker (adding 1 progress to Wall of Trees and Misleading Path) and Sam Gamgee to the quest before deck #2 drew Deep Gulley (which readied Aragorn) and deck #1 drew Ending And Failing (raising deck #1's threat to 30 and deck #2's to 32). I committed 12 against 5 threat so 3 progress explored Wall of Trees, sending it to the victory display, and the rest of the progress explored Choked With Brambles. The new stage 2B was Closing In Around Them.


 


The Fellowship had no choice but to travel to Misleading Path.


 


The Army of Flies attacked Halbarad, drawing Lost Of Witless for a shadow card so the attack did no damage. Aragorn attacked and killed the Army Of Flies, exhausting Arod to add 1 progress to Misleading Path, exploring it before the turn ended with everything readying before deck #2's threat increased to 33 and deck #1's increased to 31.


 


Turn Two began with deck #1 becoming first player and each hero gaining a resource before deck #1 drew Warden of Healing and deck #2 drew Honour Guard.


 


During planning deck #1 exhausted Steward Of Gondor to add 2 resources to Idraen before paying 1 from Eleanor and Idraen to play Arwen Undomiel, paying 1 from Idraen to play Song Of Wisdom on Idraen and paying 1 each from Beravor and Idraen to play Warden Of Healing.


 


Deck #2 paid 1 each from Halbarad and Sam Gamgee to play Weather Hills Watchman, who pulled a Dunedain Warning into deck #2's hand.


 


I committed Aragorn (naming Enemy for Wingfoot), Arwen Undomiel (adding 1 defence to Halbarad), Beravor, Frodo Baggins, Idraen, Northern Tracker (adding 1 progress to Deep Gulley), Sam Gamgee and Weather Hills Watchman before deck #1 drew two Deep Gulleys and deck #2 drew Wall of Trees. I committed 16 against 8 threat so 4 progres explored the Wall of Trees, sending it to the victory display and the rest of the progress explored stage 2B. The new stage 2B was Shifting Trees.


 


The Fellowship travelled to the partially explored Deep Gulley before I ended the turn by refreshing all cards, raising deck #1's threat to 32 and deck #2's to 34 before Shifting Trees discarded one of the Wall OF Trees from the victory display.


 


Turn Three began with deck #2 becoming first player and each hero gaining a resource before deck #2 drew Feint and deck #1 drew Northern Tracker.


 


During planning deck #2 paid 1 from Halbarad to play Dunedain Warning on Halbarad then paid 2 from Aragorn to play Defender Of Rammas.


 


Deck #1 exhausted Steward of Gondor to add 2 resources on Idraen before paying 3 from Idraen and 1 from Eleanor to play Northern Tracker


 


Moving onto the quest phase I committed Aragorn (naming Enemy for Wingfoot), Arwen Undomiel (adding 1 defence to Halbarad), Beravor, Frodo Baggins, Idraen, Northern Tracker x2 (adding 2 progress to each Deep Gulley), Sam Gamgee and Weather Hills Watchman before deck #2 drew Oppressive Forest and deck #1 drew another Deep Gulley. I committed 16 against 8 threat so 3 progress explored the active Deep Gulley and send it to the victory display before the other progress explored stage 2B. The new stage 2B was Closing In Around Them.


 


After the Fellowship travelled to Oppressive Forest I ended the turn by refreshing everything before raising deck #2's threat to 35 and deck #1's to 33.


 


Turn Four began with deck #1 becoming first player and each hero gaining a resource before deck #1 drew Warden of Arnor and deck #2 drew Guardian of Arnor.


 


Deck #1 exhausted Steward Of Gondor to add 2 resources to Idraen before paying 1 from Idraen to play Warden Of Healing on herself and paid 2 from Idraen to play Escort From Edoras. Deck #2 paid 2 from Sam and 1 from Halbarad to play Guardian Of Arnor.


 


Moving onto the quest phase I committed Aragorn (naming Location for Wingfoot), Arwen Undomiel (adding 1 defence to Halbarad), Beravor, Frodo, Idraen, Northern Tracker x2 (adding 2 progress to each Deep Gulley, exploring 2 of them), Sam Gamgee and Weather Hills Watchman. Deck #1 drew Misleading Path (which gained 1 progress from Warden Of Arnor and reading Aragorn), which surged to Tom Bombadil, who was attached to deck #1 committed to the quest. Deck #2 drew Ending And Failing, which raised deck #1's threat to 35 and deck #2's to 37.


 


I committed a total of 19 against 3 threat so 5 progress explored Oppressive Forest and the rest explored stage 2B. With 10 victory points I managed to travel to stage 3, where I added Old Man Willow and Withywindle to the staging area before drawing Wall of Trees and adding it the to the staging area.


 


The fellowship travelled to Misleading Path.


 


Old Man Willow attacked Tom Bombadil, drawing Grasping Root for no effect as a shadow card and discarding Wall Of Trees from the victory display to add 2 attack. This inflicted 4 damage on Tom.


 


Old Man Willow attacked Guardian Of Arnor but deck #2 paid 1 from Aragorn to Feint the attack after discarding a Deep Gulley from the victory display.


 


Aragorn, Dunedain Hunter, Eleanor, Guardian of Arnor and Halbarad attacked Old Man Willow, attacked Old Man Willow, inflicting 5 damage before I ended the turn by refreshing all the cards, raising deck #1's threat to 36 and deck #2's threat to 38 and reshuffling Tom Bombadil and the encounter discard pile back into the encounter deck.


 


Turn Five began with deck #2 becoming first player and resources being added before deck #2 drew Steward Of Gondor and deck #1 drew Gandalf (Core).


 


Deck #2 paid 1 from Halbarad to play Ranger Summons, adding a Ranger Of The North to the encounter deck.


 


Deck #1 exhausted Steward of Gondor to add 2 resources to Idraen then paid 3 from Idraen and 2 from Eleanor to play Gandalf (deck #1 drew Warden of Healing, Thror's Map and A Test Of Will) before paying 2 from Beravor to play Warden Of Healing.


 


Moving onto the quest phase I committed Aragorn (naming Location for Wingfoot), Arwen Undomiel (adding 1 defence to Guardian Of Arnor), Beravor, Escort From Edoras, Frodo, Idraen, Northern Tracker x2 (adding 2 progress to Deep Gulley, Wall of Trees and Withywindle and exploring Deep Gulley) and Sam Gamgee. Deck #2 drew Song Of Sleep, which deck #2 exhausted The One Ring and paid 1 from Frodo to reshuffle back into the encounter deck where it was replaced by Ranger Of The North, who added 2 progress to Withywindle before joining deck #1. Deck #1 drew Deep Gulley (which readied Aragorn).


 


I committed 19 against 8 so 2 progress explored Wall of Tress, 1 progress explored Misleading Path and 8 progress was added to stage 3B.


 


After the Fellowship travelled to Deep Gulley, Old Man Willow attacked Gandalf. The shadow card was Stange Woods for 1 extra attack and the discarded Wall of Trees buffed to 8 attack so Gandalf was killed, raising deck #1's threat to 38 and deck #2's threat to 40.


 


Old Man Willow attacked Defender Of Rammas. The shadow card was Falling Branches for +2 attack and the discarded Deep Gulley added another +2 attack so the Defender of Rammas was killed.


 


Aragorn, Beravor, Dunedain Hunter, Guardian of Arnor, Halbarad, Ranger Of The North and Weather Hills Watchman attacked Old Man Willow, inflicting another 8 damage and pushing OMW over the 12 damage threshold. All I need to do now is quest past the last .


 


At this point in the proceedings I noticed the Old Man Willow's ability adds threat instead of attack so I raised deck #1's threat to 43 and deck #2's threat to 45 at the end of the round to cover for that minor brain-fart.


 


Turn Six began with deck #1 becoming first player and resources being added before deck #1 drew Steed Of Imladris and deck #2 drew Defender Of Rammas.


 


During planning deck #1 exhausted Steward to add 2 resources to Idraen before deck #2 paid 1 from Halbarad and 2 from Sam to play Sword That Was Broken on Aragorn and paid 2 from Aragorn to play Defender Of Rammas.


 


Moving to questing I committed everyone with willpower (which was more folks thanks to Aragorn's sword-buff), committing Aragorn (with buff), Arwen (adding 1 defence to Halbarad), Beravor, Defender of Rammas (with buff), Dunedain Hunter (with buff), Eleanor, Frodo, Guardian Of Arnor (with buff), Halbarad (with buff), Idraen, Northern Tracker x2 (adding 2 progress to and exploring Withywindle), Ranger Of The North, Sam (with buff), Warden of Healing x2 and Weather Hills Watchman (with buff) before deck #1 drew Ending And Failing, which raised deck #1's threat to 45 and deck #2's to 47, and deck #2 drew Long Trailer. I committed 32 against 5 threat so 4 progress explored Deep Gulley and the other 23 threat blew through stage 3, winning the game.


 


This was odd. I added a lot of location control cards to deck #1 for this game and none of them got into play. I was lucky with encounter deck draws and this went a lot better than I expected.


 


At the end of the game I had done enough damage to Old Man Willow to add Old Bogey-Stories to the campaign log.

LORD OF THE RINGS SAGA CAMPAIGN #3: FOG ON THE BARROW DOWNS (ATTEMPT ONE).

 

Thanks to a minor error (I didn't save the writeup or copy and paste the right thing) but regardless the Fellowship just managed to win the scenario (although there was a lot of injured heroes and a ridiculous amount of dead allies). the Fellowship gained Ho, Tom Bombadil and continued onto Bree.

LORD OF THE RINGS SAGA CAMPAIGN #4: A KNIFE IN THE DARK.


 


 


Due to having less time to write-up the quests for a few weeks I'll cut things down to the high (or otherwise) lights.


 * I barely managed to make it through this.
   
 * The Fellowship suffered their first loss as Beravor died at Weathertop.
   
 * Both decks were running at over 45 threat (deck B had used Favor of the Valar to drop threat back to 45 in the last turn).
   
 * I definitely shouldn't have put three Ringwraiths into the encounter deck since this bit me on the rump at the end of the turn.
   

At the end of the game I gave Eleanor the Tireless Ranger card and Sam the Noble Hero card. Deck A gained the services (somewhat thematically) of Lore Glorfindel.

LORD OF THE RINGS SAGE CAMPAIGN #5: FLIGHT TO THE FORD.

 

Another surprising win.

 

 * Eleanor with Wingfoot and Tireless Ranger is a complete beast. She's not much of a quester (her designated job, apart from hobbling treacheries but I had three cards left in the encounter deck after Eleanor burned through about three dozen treacheries in the game).
 * At the end of the game Eaten Alive was added to the campaign pool.

That is some combo for solo play. Never face a Treachery again.

Why just solo? It's infinite use. Same goes for Spirit Merry with Tireless Ranger and Wingfoot.

In multiplayer Campaign mode, some of the Treacheries have the Peril keyword which means that another player cannot play cards or trigger effects during its resolution.

Yeah, but reducing the treacheries to the Peril ones which hit the other player(s), or ones which you just don't mind resolving, is still really potent. Me and my brother have been playing a campaign on and off for a while and he chose Eleanor as one of his heroes specifically for that combo.

I used Black Riders Frodo's ability to deal with the Treacheries which Eleanor couldn't deal with. It's somewhat dependent on getting Wingfoot out on Eleanor ASAP but it's pretty darn potent.

BOROMIR SHOWS HIS QUALITY QUEST 1: PERIL IN PELARGIR (ATTEMPT 1).


 


I've been working on a powerful deck for solo play and, after some discussion on this board and a weekend of trying to work out a strong solo deck I opted to co-opt Seastan's deck: https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/175783-one-deck-to-rule-them-all-nightmare-edition/page-1 [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/175783-one-deck-to-rule-them-all-nightmare-edition/page-1].


 


My heroes were Boromir (Tactics), Galadriel and Glorfindel (Lore). This gave me 25 threat and a opening hand containing A Good Harvest, Blood Of Numenor, Gondorian Fire x2, Nenya and Steward of Gondor. With all the ingredients needed to uber-buff Boromir I decided to keep the hand.


 


Quest set-up consisted of making The Leaping Fish the active location, attaching Alcaron's Scroll to Boromir and adding a Harbor Thug to the staging area.


 


Turn One began with adding a resource to each hero before I drew Galadriel's Handmaiden.


 


During planning I played Blood Of Numenor and Gondorian Fire on Boromir, then exhausted Galadriel to draw Arwen Undomiel and reduced my threat to 24, then played A Good Harvest and paid 1 from Boromir and Galadriel to play Steward Of Gondor on Boromir and exhausted Steward of Gondor to add 2 resources to Boromir. I ended a busy phase by paying 1 from Glorfindel to play Nenya on Galadriel.


 


Moving onto the quest phase I drew and discarded Pickpocket before committing Boromir and Glorfindel to the quest. I drew Collateral Damage and drew and discarded Harbor Thug and Market Square so had to raise my threat to 26. I committed 6 against 2 threat so 4 progress was added to The Leaping Fish.


 


I engaged the Harbor Thug, who attacked Boromir after I raised my threat to 27 to refresh him. I paid 1 from Boromir to buff his defence by 1 using Gondorian Fire. The shadow card was Umbar Assassin for no effect so the attack did no damage. I raised my threat to 28 to refresh Boromir and used him to attack the Harbor Thug, inflicting 2 damage.


 


At the end of the turn I refreshed my cards and raised my threat to 29.


 


Turn Two began with adding a resource to my heroes before I drew Daeron's Runes. I exhausted Galadriel to lower my threat to 28 and draw Light Of Valinor. I played Daeron's Runes and drew Warden Of Healing and Ancient Mathem before discarding Gondorian Fire. I then exhausted Steward of Gondor to add 2 resources to Boromir and paid 1 from Glorfindel to play Light of Valinor on Glorfindel.


 


I started the Quest phase by drawing and discarding Market Square before I committed Boromir and Glorfindel (without exhausting) before drawing City Streets. I committed 6 against 2 threat so 2 progress explored The Leaping Fish, adding it to the victory display and 2 progress was added to stage 1B.


 


After I travelled to City Streets I raised my threat to 29 to ready Boromir and paid 1 from him to use Gondorian Fire to buff his defence by 3 before Harbor Thug attacked him, drawing City Streets for 2 more attack, which Boromir's buff dealt with. Glorfindel attacked and killed the Harbor Thug.


 


At the end of the turn I refreshed everything before raising my threat to 30.


 


Turn Three began with each hero gaining a resource before I drew another Ancient Mathem. I then exhausted Steward to add another 2 resources to Boromir and exhausted Galadriel to draw Asfaloth and lower my threat to 29


 


During planning I paid 2 from Galadriel to play Asfaloth on Glorfindel. I exhausted Asfaloth to add 2 progress to City Streets, exploring it.


 


I committed Boromir and Glorfindel (without exhausting) to the quest before I drew Collateral Damage. I drew Zealous Traitor, Lossarnach Bandit, City Streets and Lurking In Shadows and raising my threat to 31. I committed 6 against 0 threat so 4 progress was added to stage 1B, exploring it. Stage 2 added Alcaron's Scroll to the staging area where I exhausted Glorfindel to add Alcaron's Scroll to him.


 


At the end of the turn I refreshed my cards before raising my threat to 32.


 


Turn Four began with adding resources before I drew Gondorian Shield, exhausted Glorfindel to draw Silver Harp and reduce my threat to 31 and exhausted Steward to add 2 resources to Boromir.


 


During planning I paid 1 from Boromir to play Gondorian Shield on him and paid 2 from Glorfindel to play Galadriel's Handmaiden, who lowered my threat to 30.


 


I committed Boromir and Glorfindel (without exhausting) before drawing Lost In The City, which forced me to put City Streets into the staging area. I then paid 1 from Boromir to play Gondorian Fire and increase his attack by 7 until the end of the phase. I also exhausted Asfaloth to add 2 progress to City Streets, exploring it. This gave me a total 13 willpower against 0 threat so the 13 progress blew through stage 2B. Stage 3 forced me to add a Harbor Thug to the staging area.


 


The Harbor Thug engaged me and (after I raised my threat to 31 to ready him) attacked Boromir, drawing Zealous Traitor for no effect. The attack did no damage. After raising my threat to 32 to refresh Boromir, he and Glorfindel attacked and killed the Harbor Thug.


 


At the end of the turn I refreshed everything before raising my threat to 33.


 


Turn Five began with my heroes each gaining a resource before I drew Core Set Gandalf and exhausted Steward to add another 2 resources to Boromir.


 


During planning I paid 2 from Galadriel to play Arwen Undomiel and paid 4 from Boromir and 1 from Glorfindel to play Gandalf, who lowered my threat to 28.


 


I committed Arwen Undomiel (without exhausting), Boromir, Galadriel's Handmaiden, Gandalf (without exhausting) and Glorfindel (without exhausting) before exhausting Galadriel and Nenya to add her willpower to Glorfindel's. I drew Collateral Damage and drew Local Trouble, Lurking In Shadows, Harbor Storehouse, Zealous Traitor, another Harbor Storehouse and Collateral Damage and raised my threat to 32.


 


In the end I committed 16 willpower against 0 threat so the 16 progress was enough to blow through stage 3B and win the game.


 


Boromir more than showed his quality when he was fully buffed. I'm guessing I got the best possible opening hand this time.


 


At the end of the quest my score was:


Completed Turns (4): 40.


Total Threat: 32.


Total VP: 3.


Total Score: 69.

MURDER AT THE PRANCING PONY (ATTEMPT 1).


 


After finally getting enough time to get some questing under my belt I decided to try the two POD quests I bought a few weeks ago. I decided to build two decks with as much of the Fellowship that I could to play through many quests in the run up to a Saga run.


 


Deck #1 contains Merry (Spirit), Pippin (Lore) and Sam Gamgee for a low 20 threat and a opening hand containing Errand-Rider, Gandalf (Core), Hobbit Pony, Self-Preservation x2 and Sneak Attack.


 


Deck #2 contains Aragorn (Lore), Boromir (Tactics) and Legolas with 32 threat and a opening hand containing Black Arrow, Defender Of Rammas, Dunedain Hunter, Gondorian Shield, Secret Vigil and Skyward Volley.


 


Quest set-up consisted of putting a Suspect and Hideout aside, setting up a Investigation deck, making the Prancing Pony the active location and putting a Ramshackle Manor into the staging area.


 


Turn One began with deck #1 becoming first player and each hero gaining a resource before deck #1 drew Celebrian's Stone and deck #2 drew Gandalf (Core).


 


Deck #1's planning consisted of playing Hobbit Pony on Merry and paying 1 from Sam to play Errand-Rider before deck #2 played Black Arrow on Legolas and paid 1 from Boromir to play Gondorian Shield on him before playing Dunedain Hunter (who pulled a Chetwood Outlaw out of the encounter deck and put it into play engaged with deck #2) and paid 1 from Legolas to play Secret Vigil on Chetwood Outlaw.


 


At the start of the quest phase deck #1 raised their threat to 22 before I committed Merry, Pippin and Sam Gamgee and drew Chetwood Outlaw, Bree-Land Informant and another Ramshackle Manor. I committed 7 willpower against 11 threat so deck #1's threat increased to 26 and deck #2's increased to 36.


 


With the situation taking a turn for the worst deck #2 was forced to engage the Bree-Land Informant before the Chetwood Outlaw attacked Dunedain Hunter. The shadow card was Greenwood Footpad, which added 2 attack and really, really killed the Dunedain Hunter. The Bree-Land Informant made a attack on Boromir. The shadow card was Bill Ferny, who forced deck #2 to take the attack undefended. Boromir took 2 damage before I raised deck #2's threat to 37 to ready him.


 


Aragorn, Boromir and Legolas attacked and killed the Chetwood Outlaw, which reduced deck #1's threat to 25 and deck #2s to 36 before adding 2 progress to the Prancing Pony, which explored it and sent it to the victory display. The investigation effect allowed me to draw Johnny Goblin-Fingers and Susie The Spider. Deck #1 ended the phase by exhausting Errand-Rider to move a resource from Merry to Pippin.


 


At the end of the turn I refreshed everything then increased deck #1's threat to 26 and deck #2's to 37.


 


Turn Two began with deck #2 becoming first player and each hero gaining a resource before deck #2 drew Athelas and deck #1 drew Faramir.


 


Deck #2 paid 3 from Pippin to add Self-Preservation to Boromir before exhausting Errand-Rider to move a resource from Merry to Sam and paid 2 from Sam to play Celebrian's Stone on him. Deck #2 paid 1 each from Boromir and Legolas to play Defender Of Rammas.


 


At the start of the quest phase I raised deck #1's threat to 28 before committing Aragorn, Merry, Pippin and Sam. I drew Old Warehouse, Market Square and another Market Square. I committed 11 willpower against 15 threat so deck #1's threat increased to 41.


 


Faced with a bad selection the Fellowship travelled to Old Warehouse, drawing Village Stable and adding it to the staging area.


 


The Bree-Land Informant attacked Boromir, drawing Ramshackle Manor for no effect. I opted to pay 1 from Aragorn and raised deck #2's threat to 42 to look at the bottom card of the Investigation deck, Todd The Troll and discard the Bree-Land Informant. Deck #2 then exhausted Self-Preservation to heal 2 damage from Boromir.


 


I ended the turn by rrefreshing everything before I raised deck #1's threat to 33 and deck #2's to 43.


 


Turn Three began with deck #1 becoming first player and each hero gaining a resource before deck #1 drew Errand-Rider and deck #2 drew Grappling Hook.


 


Knowing that even if I committed everyone with any willpower I was still 2 short of the current threat total I opted to quit the game.


## 352 [silverthorn on June 4, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=2249935)

SAGA RUN: A SHADOW OF THE PAST (ATTEMPT 1).


 


For this run-through of the LOTR saga I opted to play two-handed.


 


Deck #1 comprised Beravor, Glorfindel (Spirit) and Idraen with 26 threat and a (post-mulligan) opening hand containing Arwen Undomiel, Elrond's Counsel, Fast Hitch, The Evening Star and The Favour Of The Lady.


 


Deck #2 comprised Aragorn (Tactics), Halbarad and Sam Gamgee with 30 threat and a opening hand containing Errand-Rider, Feint, Ranger Summons, Secret Vigil and Steward Of Gondor.


 


Set-up for the quest consisted of adding Frodo Baggins (TBR, with Mr. Underhill and The One Ring) into play attached to deck #1, putting Gandalf's Delay into play, making Bag End the active location and adding a Black Rider to the staging area.


 


Turn One began with deck #1 becoming first player and each hero gaining a resource before deck #1 drew Steed Of Imladris and deck #2 drew Weather Hills Watchman.


 


Deck #1 paid 1 from Glorfindel and Idraen to play Arwen Undomiel and paid 1 from Beravor to play Fast Hitch on Sam Gamgee.


 


Deck #2 paid 1 from Halbarad and Sam Gamgee to play Steward Of Gondor on Halbarad before exhausting it to add 2 resources to Halbarad and paying the 2 resources to play Weather Hills Watchman, whose ability put a Dunedain Warning into deck #2's hand.


 


In the quest phase I committed Arwen Undomiel (adding 1 defence and sentinel to Halbarad), Beravor, Frodo Baggins, Glorfindel (raising deck #1's threat to 27), Idraen and Sam Gamgee before deck #1 drew Evil Crow and deck #2 drew Pathless Country. I committed 14 willpower against 8 threat. 3 progress explored Bag End, sending it to the victory display and allowing deck #1 to draw Gandalf (Core) and deck #2 to draw Dunedain Warning before 1 progress explored stage 1B. Stage 2B added another Black Rider to the staging area.


 


The Fellowship opted to travel to Pathless Country.


 


Deck #2 opted to engage the Evil Crow.


 


The Evil Crow made a undefended attack on Halbarad, drawing Mustering For The Ring for no effect. No damage is taken before Aragorn attacks and kills the Evil Crow. Aragorn's ability triggers and forces one of the Black Riders to engage deck #2, which readies and buffs Sam Gamgee. Halbarad, Sam Gamgee and Weather Hills Watchman attack the Black Rider, inflicting 1 damage.


 


At the end of the turn everything refreshed before deck #1's threat increased to 28 and deck #2's increased to 31.


 


Turn Two began with deck #2 becoming first player and each hero gaining a resource before deck #2 drew Weather Hills Watchman and deck #1 drew The Long Defeat.


 


Deck #2 exhausted Steward of Gondor to add 2 resources to Halbarad before paying 2 from Halbarad to add 2 Dunedain Warnings to Halbarad and paying 1 each from Halbarad and Sam to play Weather Hills Watchman, who pulled another Ranger Summons into deck #2's hand.


 


Deck #1 paid 1 from Beravor to play The Long Defeat on stage 2B before paying 1 from Glorfindel to play Steed Of Imladris on Idraen.


 


I committed Arwen Undomiel (adding 1 defence and sentinel to Halbarad), Beravor, Frodo Baggins, Glorfindel (raising deck #1's threat to 29), Halbarad (without exhausting), Idraen (exhausting Steed Of Imladris and discarding The Evening Star to add 2 progress to Pathless Country) and Sam Gamgee. Deck #2 drew Have You Seen Baggins?, which I immediately paid 1 from Frodo and exhausted The One Ring to reshuffle into the encounter deck. Deck #2 drew Green Hill Country and deck #1 drew Gildor Inglorion, which was attached to deck #2. I committed 16 willpower against 6 threat so 1 progress explored Pathless Country and 9 progress was added to stage 2B.


 


The Fellowship travelled to Green Hill Country.


 


The Black Rider attacked Halbarad, drawing Green Hill Country for +1 attack and inflicting 1 damage. After exhausting Fast Hitch to refresh Sam Gamgee Aragorn, Gildor Inglorion, Sam Gamgee and both Weather Hills Watchmen attacked and killed the Black Rider. Aragorn's ability triggered and forced the remaining Black Rider to engage deck #2, which refreshed and buffed Sam Gamgee, who unfortunately could do nothing.


 


At the end of the turn I refreshed everything and raised deck #1's threat to 30 and deck #2's to 32 before discarding Gildor Inglorion.


 


Turn Three began with deck #1 becoming first player and each hero gaining a resource before deck #1 drew Miner Of The Iron Hills and deck #2 drew Galadriel.


 


Deck #1 paid 1 from Glorfindel and Idraen to play Favour Of The Lady on Glorfindel.


 


Deck #2 exhausted Steward to add 2 resources to Halbarad before paying 3 from Halbarad to play Galadriel, who attached Sword That Was Broken to Aragorn, who then paid 2 to play 2 copies of Ranger Summons and shuffled 2 Rangers Of The North into the encounter deck.


 


I committed Arwen Undomiel (adding 1 defence and sentinel on Halbarad), Beravor, Frodo Baggins, Galadriel (with Sword buff), Glorfindel (raising deck #1's threat to 31), Halbarad (without exhausting and with Sword buff), Idraen and Sam Gamgee (with Sword buff). Deck #1 drew Stock Road and deck #2 drew Lure Of The Ring, which forced deck #1 to exhaust the One Ring before deck #2 drew another Stock Road. Deck #1 played Elrond's Counsel on Idraen to add 1 willpower and reduce deck #1's threat to 28. I committed 22 willpower versus 6 threat so 3 progress explored Green Hill Country and 13 progress was added to stage 2B, exploring it. The Long Defeat triggered, allowing deck #1 to draw Light Of Valinor on The Riddermark's Finest and deck #2 to draw Dagger Of Westernesse and Honour Guard. Stage 3 added the Buckleberry Ferry and another Black Rider to the staging area.


 


Deck #2 paid 1 from Aragorn to Feint the Black Rider's attack before attacking it with Aragorn, Halbarad, Sam Gamgee and Weather Hills Watchman x2, inflicting 5 damage.


 


At the end of the turn I refreshed everything, discarded Galadriel and raised deck #1's threat to 29 and deck #2's threat to 33.


 


Turn Four began with deck #2 becoming first player and each hero gaining a resource before deck #2 drew Dunedain Hunter and deck #1 drew Evening Star.


 


Deck #2 exhausted the Steward of Gondor to add 2 resources to Halbarad, then paid 1 from Aragorn to play Dagger Of Westernesse on him and paid 1 from Halbarad to play Errand-Rider.


 


Deck #1 paid 1 each from Glorfindel and Idraen to play The Riddermark's Finest and paid 2 from Beravor to play The Evening Star, adding 2 progress to each of the Stock Roads in the staging area, then exhausted and discarded The Riddermark's Finest to add 2 progress to one of the Stock Roads, exploring it before paying 1 from Glorfindel to play Light Of Valinor on him.


 


I committed Arwen Undomiel (adding 1 defence and sentinel to Halbarad), Beravor, Glorfindel (without exhausting), Halbarad (without exhausting and with Sword buff), Idraen (discarding Miner Of The Iron Hills to add 1 progress to Pathless County with Steed of Imladris, exploring it and refreshing Idraen) and Sam Gamgee (with Sword buff). Deck #2 drew Evil Crow and deck #1 drew Ranger Of The North, which was attached to deck #2 and added 2 damage to the Black Rider in the staging area. I committed 14 willpower against 8 threat so successfully quested.


 


Deck #2 committed Frodo and the Ranger Of The North before taking a Hide 3 test, drawing 2x Have You Seen Baggins and Ride Like A Gale, passing the test so that the Fellowship could travel to Buckleberry Ferry.


 


Deck #2 engaged the Evil Crow.


 


The Black Rider attacked Halbarad, drawing Black Steed for no effect so the attack did no damage. The Evil Crow made a undefended attack on Aragorn, drawing Hunting For The Ring for no effect so the attack did no damage. Aragorn and one of the Weather Hills Watchmen killed the Black Rider and used Aragorn's ability to engage the other Black Rider (which refreshed and buffed Sam Gamgee). Sam proceeded to kill the Evil Crow.


 


I ended the turn by refreshing everything before raising deck #1's threat to 30 and deck #2's threat to 34.


 


Turn Five began with deck #1 becoming first player and each hero gaining a resource before deck #1 drew Henamarth Riversong and deck #2 drew Errand-Rider.


 


Deck #1 paid 1 each from Beravor, Glorfindel and Idraen and 2 from Frodo to play Gandalf, which added 4 damage to the last remaining Black Rider, killing it.


 


Deck #2 paid 1 from Boromir to play Errand-Rider.


 


I committed Aragorn (with Sword buff), Arwen Undomiel (adding 1 defence and sentinel to Halbarad), Beravor, Errand-Rider x2 (with Sword buff), Frodo Baggins, Gandalf, Glorfindel (without exhausting), Halbarad (with Sword buff), Idraen, Ranger Of The North (with Sword buff), Sam Gamgee (with Sword buff) and Weather Hills Watchman x2(with Sword buff). Deck #1 drew Black Steed, which surged to Pathless Country before deck #2 drew Woody End. With 3 threat in the staging area I committed a somewhat impressive 34 willpower so 31 progress was added to Buckleberry Ferry, exploring it and winning the game.


 


Loading deck #1 with more than the average number of anti-location cards seemed to work since I think the average length of this quest has been 10+ turns.


 


At the end of the quest I opted to add The Ring Draws Them and Mr. Underhill to the quest log.

Unfortunately, I didn't manage to get Old Bogey-Stories (preferring to not push my luck since I don't think I drew a Enemy in planning all game).

SAGA RUN: FOG ON THE BARROW DOWNS.

I was half-way through stage 3 when my computer crashed and corrupted the text document I was typing up. Since I had been playing for 2 1/2 hours and was making good progress I opted to not start again Despite that I managed to win the quest with Halbarad on one round but nobody killed. I gained Ho! Tom Bombadil for the campaign log.

There has been a change of plans concerning the saga run-through. I typed up some course-work for a friend and he wound up surprising me by buying me the last three quest packs (Dread Realm, Stormcaller and Thing From The Depths). SInce I now have Hero Arwen I've gone with something like the deck I used all the time in the old Decipher LOTR card game, namely Arwen and a whole load of Rangers. I'm going to be restarting the saga run through with the new decks (one with Aragorn (Lore), Arwen Undomiel and Idraen and one with Elladan, Elrohir and Halbarad).

GONDOR SHOWS IT'S QUALITY - PERIL IN PELARGIR.


 


After reading the Denethor and Sons article I decided to try out the deck. My heroes were the leadership versions of Boromir, Denethor and Faramir, with 30 threat and a opening hand containing Captain's Wisdom, Envoy Of Pelargir, Gandalf (Core), Guard Of The Citadel, Heir Of Mardil and Squire Of The Citadel.


 


After some consideration I opted to take a mulligan, drawing Citadel Custodian, Envoy Of Pelargir, For Gondor, Gandalf (Core), Veteran of Osgiliath and Visionary Leadership.


 


Quest set-up comprised adding 2 resources to Denethor, making The Leaping Fish the active location, adding Alcaron's Scroll to Denethor and adding a Harbour Thug to the staging area.


 


I started turn one by adding a resource to each hero before drawing another Gandalf.


 


My planning consisted of paying 2 from Denethor to play Visionary Leadership on Boromir and paying 1 each from Denethor and Faramir to play Envoy Of Pelargir, who added a resource to Denethor.


 


At the start of the quest phase I drew and discarded Collateral Damage before committing Envoy Of Pelargir (for 2) and Faramir (for 2).


 


I drew Harbour Storehouse so committed 4 attack against 3 threat and added 1 progress to The Leaping Fish.


 


I was forced to engage the Harbour Thug, which allowed Faramir to refresh the Envoy Of Pelargir.


 


The Harbour Thug attacked Denethor, drawing Pelargir Docks and doing no damage.


 


Boromir and the Envoy of Pelargir attacked and killed the Harbour Thug.


 


I ended the turn by refreshing my cards and raising my threat to 31.


 


Turn two began with adding a resource to each hero before I drew Heir of Mardil.


 


I paid 1 from Boromir to attach Heir of Mardil to him.


 


I started the quest phase by drawing and discarding Local Trouble before committing Boromir (for 3), Envoy Of Pelargir (for 2) and Faramir (for 2).


 


I drew Collateral Damage and drew and discarded Lossarnach Bandit, Harbour Thug, Pelargir Docks (raising my threat to 34) and another Collateral Damage.


 


I committed 7 attack against 1 threat so 5 progress explored The Leaping Fish (sending it to the victory display) and 1 progress was added to stage 1B.


 


I travelled to Harbour Storehouse before ending the turn by refreshing my cards and raising my threat to 35.


 


Turn three began with adding resources before I drew Steward of Gondor.


 


I paid 2 from Denehor to play Steward of Gondor on himself, then exhausted Steward to add 2 resources back to Denethor before paying 2 from Denethor and 1 from Faramir to play Veteran of Osgiliath.


 


I committed Boromir (for 3), Envoy Of Pelargir (for 2), Faramir (for 2) and Veteran Of Osgiliath (for 3) before I drew Lurking In Shadows, which surged to another Harbour Storehouse.


 


I committed 10 attack against 1 threat so 4 progress explored Harbour Storehouse and 5 progress was added to stage 1B, exploring it. Stage 2 moved Alcaron's Scroll to the staging area where I exhausted Denethor to reattach it onto him.


 


After travelling to the Harbour Storehouse I ended the turn by refreshing my cards and raising my threat to 36.


 


Turn four began with adding resources before I drew Strength Of Arms.


 


After exhausting Steward of Gondor to add 2 resources to Denethor I paid 3 from Denethor to play Citadel Custodian.


 


I committed Boromir (for 3), Citadel Custodian (for 1), Envoy Of Pelargir (for 2), Faramir (for 2) and Veteran Of Osgiliath (for 3) before I drew Pickpocket.


 


I committed 11 attack against 3 threat so 4 progress explored Harbour Storehouse and 4 progress was added to stage 2B.


 


I engaged the Pickpocket, refreshing the Veteran of Osgiliath.


 


The Pickpocket attacked Denethor (forcing me to remove a resource from Boromir and discard a Gandalf from my hand), drawing City Streets for +2 attack and doing no damage before the bufffed Veteran of Osgiliath killed the Pickpocket.


 


At the end of the turn I refreshed my cards and raised my threat to 37.


 


Turn Five began with adding resources before I drew A Very Good Tale.


 


After exhausting Steward of Gondor to add 2 resources to Denethor I played A Very Good Tale, exhausting Envoy Of Pelargir and Citadel Custodian to put Pelargir Ship-Captain and Gandalf into play (using Gandalf's ability to draw Squire Of The Citadel, antoher Citadel Custodian and another Squire of The Citadel) before paying 2 from Denethor to play both Squires and the Citalde Custodian.


 


I committed Boromir (for 3), Citadel Custodian (for 1), Faramir (for 2), Gandalf (for 4), Pelargir Ship-Captain (for 2) and Squire of the Citadel x2 (for 2 total) before drawing Collateral Damage (drawing and discarding Pickpocket, Zealous Traitor, another Zealous Traitor, Lost In The City, Market Square (increasing my threat to 39), Harbour Thug, another Market Square (raising my threat to 41) and Umbar Assassin). I committed 14 against 0 threat so added all 14 progress to stage 2B, exploring it.


 


Stage 3 added a Harbour Thug to the staging area, who engaged me (refreshing Gandalf) and attacked Gandalf, drawing City Streets for +2 attack and inflicting 1 damage before Denethor transferred a resource to Boromir, refreshing him before Boromir and Denethor attacked and killed the Harbour Thug.


 


I ended the turn by refreshing my cards before discarding Gandalf and increasing my threat to 40.


 


Turn Six began with adding resources before I drew Herald Of Anorion.


 


After exhausting Steward to add 2 resources to Denethor I paid 2 from Denethor to play Herald of Anorion and paid 2 from Denethor and 3 from Faramir to play Gandalf (who lowered my threat to 35)


 


I opted to go all in, committing Boromir (for 2), Citadel Custodian x2 (for 4 total), Denethor (for 2), Envoy Of Pelargir (for 2), Faramir (for 3), Gandalf (for 4), Herald Of Anorion (for 2), Pelargir Ship-Captain (for 2), Squire Of The Citadel x2 (for 2 total) and Veteran Of Osgiliath (for 2) before I drew Local Trouble, which I attached to Boromir. I committed 25 willpower against 0 threat so massively over-quested and won the quest.


 


This deck works well (and confounds all the complaints I've had in the past about playing all Gondor decks). I'm considering building another tri-sphere all-Gondor deck to use alongside this one.


 


In the end my score was:


 


Completed Rounds (5): 50.


Total Threat: 35.


Total VP: 3.


Total Score: 82.

Nice report .. i think that you sometimes misses the +1 WIL from Visionary Leadership on Faramir and perhaps on Boromir (last round).

I probably forgot that the WP buff is on heroes since Boromir's Attack buff is ally-only. I've got no real experience of playing a all-Gondor deck.

THE GREY COMPANY: PERIL IN PELARGIR.


 


I opted to switch to a two-deck version of the Grey Company. The decks are available at http://www.ringsdb.com/fellowship/view/1376 [http://www.ringsdb.com/fellowship/view/1376] .


 


Deck #1 comprised Elladan, Elrohir and Halbarad with 30 threat and a opening hand (after a mulligan) containing Envoy Of Pelargir, Faramir, Honour Guard, Rivendell Blade x2 and Steward of Gondor.


 


Deck #2's heroes were Aragorn (Lore), Bervor and Idraen, with 33 threat and a opening hand (after mulligan) containing Cloak Of Lorien, Gandalf (Core), Light Of Valinor, Northern Tracker, Ranger Of Cardolan and The Galadhrim's Greeting.


 


I made The Leaping Fish the active location, attached Alcaron's Scroll to Elrohir and added 2 Harbour Thugs to the staging area before making deck #1 the first player.


 


I started turn one by adding a resource to each hero before deck #1 drew Secret Vigil and deck #2 drew Ioreth.


 


Deck #1 paid 1 each from Elrohir and Halbarad to play Steward of Gondor on Elrohir, then exhausted it to add 2 resources to Elrohir before I paid 1 from Elladan to play Rivendell Blade on him.


 


Deck #2 paid 1 from Aragorn to play Cloak Of Lorien on Elrohir.


 


I drew and discarded Collateral Damage and Lurking In Shadows then committed Aragorn, Beravor and Idraen and drew Market Square and Harbour Storehouse.


 


I committed 8 willpower against 8 threat so no progress was added.


 


Deck #1 opted to engage both Harbour Thugs.


 


The first Harbour Thug attacked Elrohir (who paid 1 to refresh), drawing Pelargir Docks for no effect and inflicting no damage.


 


The second Harbour Thug attacked Elrohir, drawing Harbour Storehouse and drawing Lossarnach Bandit for no effect and doing no damage.


 


Elladan attacked and killed one of the Harbour Thugs and Halbarad attacked the other, inflicting 1 damage.


 


At the end of the turn I refreshed all cards and raised deck #1's threat to 31 and deck #2's to 34 before making deck #2 the first player.


 


Turn Two began with each hero gaining a resource before deck #2 drew Galadhrim Minstrel and deck #1 drew Guardian Of Arnor.


 


Deck #2 paid 1 each from Aragorn and Idraen to play Galadhrim Minstrel (who added The Galadhrim's Greeting to hand) and played Ioreth.


 


Deck #1 exhausted Steward of Gondor to add 2 resources to Elrohir and paid 3 from Elrohir and 1 from Halbarad to play Faramir.


 


I drew and discarded 2 copies of City Streets (raising deck #1's threat to 33 and deck #2's to 36) before committing Aragorn, Beravor, Faramir, Halbarad (without exhausting) and Idraen and drawing Harbour Thug and Collateral Damage (which discarded Pickpocket, Zealous Traitor, another Pickpocket and Lossarnach Bandit).


 


I committed 12 willpower against 6 threat so added 6 progress to The Leaping Fish, exploring it and sending it to the victory display (as well as refreshing Idraen).


 


I opted to travel to Harbour Storehouse.


 


Deck #1 optionally engaged the Harbour Thug.


 


The wounded Harbour Thug attacked Elrohir (who paid 1 to refresh). The shadow card was City Streets which added 2 attack so Elrohir took 1 damage.


 


The second Harbour Thug attacked Elrohir. The shadow card was Local Trouble so did no damage.


 


Halbarad attacked the unwounded Harbour Thug, inflicting 1 damage before Elladan attacked and killed the wounded Harbour Thug.


 


I ended the turn by refreshing everything and raising deck #1's threat to 34 and deck #2's threat to 37 before making deck #1 the first player.


 


Turn Three began with each hero gaining a resource before deck #1 drew Weather Hills Watchman and deck #2 drew Weather-Stained Cloak.


 


Deck #1 exhausted Steward to add 2 resources to Elrohir, then paid them to play Weather Hills Watchman (who added Ranger Summons to hand), then paid 1 from Halbarad to play Ranger Summons and shuffle a Ranger Of The North into the encounter deck before paying 2 from Elladan to play Honour Guard.


 


Deck #2 played Weather-Stained Cloak on Elrohir.


 


I committed Aragorn, Beravor, Faramir, Halbarad (without exhausting) and Idraen before I drew Collateral Damage (which drew Zealous Traitor, Pelargir Docks, Harbour Thug, Local Trouble, Lurking In Shadows and another Zealous Traitor and raised deck #1's threat to 37 and deck #2's to 40) and Ranger Of The North, who entered play attached to deck #1 and added 1 progress to Market Square, discarding it and refreshing Idraen before surging to another Market Square.


 


I committed 11 against 3 threat so 4 progress explored Harbour Storehouse and 4 progress was added to stage 1B.


 


I paid 1 from Elrohir to travel to Market Square.


 


The Harbour Thug attacked Elrohir, drawing Pickpocket and discarding Elladan's Rivendell Blade, but doing no damage.

I ended the turn by refreshing everything, raising deck #1's threat to 38 and deck #2's to 41 and making deck #2 the first player.

Deck #2 paid 4 from Idraen to play Northern Tracker.


 


Deck #1 paid 1 from Elladan to play Rivendell Blade on himself, exhausted Steward to add 2 resource to Elrohir and paid 2 from Elrohir and 1 from Halbarad to play Guardian Of Arnor.


 


I committed Aragorn, Beravor, Faramir, Idraen, Northern Tracker, Ranger Of The North and Weather Hills Watchman and drew Umbar Assassin and another Collateral Damage (drawing and discarding Harbour Thug and Lost In The City, reshuffling the encounter deck and drawing and discarding Lossarnach Bandit, Pickpocket, Collateral Damage, Harbour Storehouse, Lurking In Shadows and another Collateral Damage and raising deck #1's threat to 40 and deck #2's threat to 43).


 


I committed 13 against 4 threat so added 1 progress to Market Square, exploring it and refreshing Idraen before I added 2 progress to stage 1B, exploring it.


 


Stage 2 attached Alcaron's Scroll to the Umbar Assassin.


 


The Umbar Assassin engaged deck #1, inflicting 3 damage onto Halbarad.


 


The Umbar Assassin inflicted 2 archery damage on Elladan, then attacked Elrohir, drawing Lossarnach Bandit for no effect and inflicting 1 damage.


 


Elladan and Halbarad attacked and killed the Umbar Assassin, returning Alcaron's Scroll to the staging area where Deck #2 exhausted Idraen to attach it to her.


 


I ended the turn by refreshing everything and raising deck #1's threat to 41 and deck #2's to 44 (deck #2 used Aragorn's ability to drop their threat to 33) before making deck #1 the first player.


 


Turn Five began with each hero gaining a resource before deck #1 drew Sword That Was Broken and deck #2 drew Miner Of The Iron Hills.


 


Deck #1 exhausted Steward of Gondor to add 2 resources to Elrohir, then paid 3 from Elrohir to play Sword That Was Broken on Aragorn.


 


Deck #2 paid 1 from Idraen to play Light Of Valinor on Elladan.


 


I committed Aragorn, Beravor, Elladan (without exhausting), Faramir, Idraen, Northern Tracker, Ranger Of The North and Weather Hills Watchman, then drew Local Trouble (attaching it to Aragorn) and Lurking In Shadows, which surged to Harbour Thug.


 


I committed 17 against 2 threat so added 15 progress to stage 2, exploring it.


 


Stage 3 forced me to add 2 more Harbour Thugs to the staging area.


 


Deck #1 engaged all the Harbour Thugs.


 


The first Harbour Thug attacked Elrohir (who paid 1 to refresh), drawing Zealous Traitor and inflicting no damage.


 


The second Harbour Thug attacked Elrohir, drawing Collateral Damage and inflicting no damage.


 


The last Harbour Thug attacked Guardian Of Arnor, drawing Zealous Traitor for no effect and inflicting no damage.


 


Elladan attacked the first Harbour Thug, killing it and paid 1 to refresh before killing the second Harbour Thug before Halbarad attacked the remaining Harbour Thug, inflicting 1 damage.


 


I ended the turn by refreshing everything (which raised deck #2's threat to 34) and raising deck #1's threat to 42 and deck #2's to 35 before making deck #2 the first player.


 


Turn Six began with each hero gaining a resource before deck #2 drew another Northern Tracker and deck #1 drew Dagger Of Westernesse.


 


Deck #2 paid 2 from Beravor to play Miner Of The Iron Hills.


 


Deck #1 exhausted Steward to add 2 resources to Elrohir.


 


I committed Aragorn (raising deck #2's threat to 36), Beravor, Elladan (without exhausting), Elrohir, Galadhrim Minstrel, Guardian Of Arnor, Halbarad (without exhausting), Idraen, Ioreth, Northern Tracker, Ranger Of The North and Weather Hills Watchman before exhausting Faramir to add 1 willpower to all deck #2's characters (in addition to the +1 from Sword That Was Broken) and drew Pickpocket and Harbour Storehouse.


 


I committed 32 willpower against 4 threat so made more than enough progress to complete the stage and win the quest.


 


These decks are probably going to need a bit of a polish. The fact that Deck #2 ended up a total of 8 resources tells me that I'll probably have to make some changes there. Deck #1 seemed to work better but I'm planning on running through a heck of a lot of quests so there's plenty of time for fine-tuning.


 


In the end my score was:


 


Completed rounds (5): 50.


Total Threat: 77.


Total damage on surviving heroes: 7.


Total VP: 3.


Total Score: 131.

Yeah, I just haven't had much time to play recently, mixed with a lot of just deck building but I decided to go with building two decks and fine-tune them instead of just randomly building decks. I will be posting more games from now on.

SOLO SAGA SHOWDOWN: A SHADOW OF THE PAST (ATTEMPT ONE).

 

I decided to give the saga another try (since I've never played past the end of box set 2). I opted to go for a solo attempt, using the deck from https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2016/6/14/lore-of-the-rings-part-two/ [https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2016/6/14/lore-of-the-rings-part-two/].

 

My heroes were Aragorn (Tactics), Frodo Baggins (TBR, with Mr. Underhill and The One Ring), Gandalf and Glorfindel (Spirit). This gave me a somewhat high 31 threat and a opening hand containing A Test Of Will, Light Of Valinor, Quick Strike, Rohan Warhorse and Tale Of Tanuviel.

 

Quest set-up consisted of putting Gandalf's Delay into play, making Bag End the active location and adding a Black Rider to the staging area.

 

Turn One began with each hero gaining a resource before I drew A Test Of Will (making Silvan Refugee the top card).

 

I paid 1 from Glorfindel to play Light of Valinor on him, paid 1 from Aragorn to play Rohan Warhorse on him and paid 1 from Gandalf to play Silvan Refugee (making Galadriel's Handmaiden the top card).

 

I committed Frodo Baggins (for 2), Glorfindel (for 3, without exhausting) and Silvan Refugee (for 2) before drawing Green Hill Country so I committed 7 willpower against 6 threat and added 1 progress to Bag End.

 

I opted to engage the Black Rider, then sent Mr. Underhill to the victory display to stop the Black Rider attacking this turn.

 

Aragorn, Gandalf and Glorfindel joined forces to kill the Black Rider.

 

I ended the turn by refreshing my cards and raising my threat to 32.

 

Turn Two began with each of my heroes gaining a resource before I drew Galadriel's Handmaiden (making Honor Guard the top card).

 

I paid 1 from Aragorn and Gandalf to play Honor Guard (making Gandalf's Staff the top card).

 

I opted to commit Frodo Baggins (for 2), Glorfindel (for 3, without exhausting) and Silvan Refugee (for 2) before I drew Black Steed, which surged to The Ring Draws Them, which surged to The Marish. I committed 7 willpower against 5 threat so added 2 progress to Bag End, exploring it and sending it to the victory display before I drew Gandalf's Staff (making Rivendell Blade the top card).

 

After opting to travel to Green Hill Country I ended the turn by refreshing my cards and raising my threat to 33.

 

Turn Three began with each of my heroes gaining a resource before I drew Rivendell Blade (making Tale Of Tinuviel the top card).

 

I paid 1 from Aragorn and Gandalf to play Gandalf's Staff on Gandalf, then exhausted it to add 1 resource to Aragorn and paid the resource to play Rivendell Blade on Glorfindel.

 

I committed Frodo (for 2), Glorfindel (for 3, without exhausting) and Silvan Refugee (for 2) before I drew Bamfurlong. I committed 7 willpower against 5 threat so added 2 progress to Green Hill Country.

 

I ended the turn by refreshing my cards and raising my threat to 34.

 

Turn Four began with my heroes gaining a resource each before I drew Tale Of Tinuvial (making Westfold Horse-Breeder the top card).

 

I paid 1 from Gandalf to play Westfold Horse-Breeder (making Unexpected Courage the top card and adding Shadowfax to my hand, which made another Westfold Horse-Breeder the top card), exhausted Gandalf's Staff to add 1 resource to Aragorn and paid 2 from Aragorn and 1 from Frodo to play Shadowfax on Gandalf. I ended a busy phase by paying 2 from Glorfindel to play Galadriel's Handmaiden (which lowered my threat to 33).

 

I committed Frodo (for 2), Galadriel's Handmaiden (for 2), Gandalf (for 3, refreshing with Shadowfax), Glorfindel (for 3, without exhausting) and Silvan Refugee (for 2) before I drew Rode Like A Gale, which surged to Woody End. I committed 12 willpower against 6 threat so 1 progress explored Green Hill Country and 1 progress explored stage 1B. Stage 2 added another Black Rider to the staging area.

 

After travelling to The Marish, I engaged the Black Rider, who attacked the Westfold Horse-Breeder, drawing Stock-Brook for no effect and killing the Westfold Horse-Breeder before Aragorn, Gandalf and Glorfindel teamed up to kill the Black Rider.

 

I ended the turn by refreshing my cards and raising my threat to 34.

 

Turn Five began with each of my heroes gaining a resource before I drew Westfold Horse-Breeder (making Straight Shot the top card).

 

I paid 1 from Glorfindel to play Westfold Horse-Breeder (whose ability did nothing but shuffle my deck, making Bilbo Baggins the top card), then exhausted Gandalf's Staff to add 1 resource to Gandalf and paid 2 from Gandalf to play Bilbo Baggins (who searched my deck for Wizard Pipe, making Gandalf's Staff the top card) and paid 1 from Aragorn to play Wizard Pipe on Gandalf.

 

I committed Bilbo Baggins (for 2), Frodo (for 2), Galadriel's Handmaiden (for 2), Gandalf (for 3, refreshing with Shadowfax), Glorfindel (for 3, without exhausting) and Silvan Refugee (for 2) before I drew Gildor Inglorion. I committed 14 willpower against 3 threat so 4 progress explored The Marish and 7 progress was added to stage 2B.

 

After travelling to Bamfurlong I ended the turn by refreshing my cards and raising my threat to 35 before I paid 1 from Frodo to retain the services of Gildor.

 

Turn Six began with each hero gaining a resource before I drew Gandalf's Staff (making Dunedain Hunter the top card).

 

I committed Bilbo Baggins (for 2), Frodo (for 2), Galadriel's Handmaiden (for 2), Gandalf (for 3, refreshing with Shadowfax), Glorfindel (for 3) and Silvan Refugee (for 2) before I drew Evil Crow. I committed 14 willpower against 3 threat so 2 progress explored Bamfurlong and 9 progress explored stage 2B. Stage 3 added Buckleberry Ferry and another Black Rider to the staging area.

 

After travelling to Woody End I was forced to engage the Evil Crow and the Black Rider.

 

The Black Rider attacked the Westfold Horse-Breeder, killing her before the Evil Crow made a undefended attack on Aragorn, doing no damage. Aragorn, Gandalf and Glorfindel team attacked the Black Rider, killing it before I exhausted the Rohan Warhorse to refresh Aragorn and used him to kill the Evil Crow.

 

After all that I ended the turn by refreshing my cards, paying 1 from Frodo to keep Gildor and raising my threat to 36.

 

Turn Seven began with adding resources and drawing Dunedain Hunter (making Gandalf's Staff the top card).

 

I opted to risk playing the Dunedain Hunter, putting a Evil Crow into play engaged with myself.

 

I committed Bilbo Baggins (for 2), Frodo (for 2), Galadriel's Handmaiden (for 2), Gandalf (for 3, refreshing with Shadowfax), Glorfindel (for 3) and Silvan Refugee (for 2) before I drew another Evil Crow. I committed 14 willpower against 5 threat so added 1 progress to Woody End, exploring it.

 

I made a Hide test, committing Dunedain Hunter, Gandalf, Gildor Inglorion and Glorfindel for 10 willpower and drawing Black Rider, Green Hill Country and Stock Road for 10 threat so I passed the test and travelled to Buckleberry Ferry.

 

I engaged the Evil Crow in the staging area before both Evil Crows made undefended attacks on Aragorn, each inflicting no damage.

 

Aragorn attacked and killed one of the Evil Crows, then exhausted Rohan Warhorse to refresh himself and killed the other Evil Crow. I then exhausted Gandalf''s Staff to draw Gandalf's Staff (making Light Of Valinor the top card).

 

At the end of the turn I refreshed everything, paid 1 from Frodo and raised my threat to 37.

After skipping planning I committed Aragorn (for 2), Bilbo (for 2), Dunedain Hunter (for 1), Frodo (for 2), Galadriel's Handmaiden (for 2), Gandalf (for 3, refreshing with Shadowfax), Gildor (for 3), Glorfindel (for 3, without exhausting) and Silvan Refugee (for 2) before I drew Pathless Country. I committed 20 willpower against 2 threat so added 18 progress to Buckleberry Ferry, more than exploring it and winning the game.

 

I opted to take the Boon Gildor Inglorion and the Burden The Ring Draws Them.

 

My final score was:

Completed Turns (7): 70.

Total Threat: 36.

Total VP: 2.

Final Score: 104.

SOLO SAGA SHOWDOWN: THE OLD FOREST.


 


My heroes were Aragorn (Tactics), Frodo Baggins (TBR, with The One Ring), Gandalf and Glorfindel (Spirit). This gave me a somewhat high 31 threat and a opening hand containing Bilbo Baggins, Light Of Valinor, Quick Strike, Tale Of Tinuviel and Westfold Horse-Breeder.


 


Quest set-up consisted of attaching Old Bogey-Stories to Frodo and adding Wall of Trees to the staging area before I drew Tale of Tinuviel and moved to a random stage 2, Shifting Trees.


 


I started Turn One by adding a resource to my heroes before I drew Rivendell Blade (making Elrond's Counsel the top card of the deck).


 


I paid 1 from Aragorn to play Rivendell Blade on Glorfindel and paid 1 from Glorfindel to play Light of Valinor on himself.


 


I committed Aragorn (for 2), Frodo (for 2) and Glorfindel (for 3, without exhausting) before I drew Lost And Witless, which did nothing but surge to Ending And Failing, which raised my threat to 33. I opted to play Elrond's Counsel (which added 1 willpower to Frodo and lowered my threat to 30) (making A Test Of Will the top card). I committed 7 willpower against 1 threat so 4 progress explored Wall of Trees and 2 progress explored Shifting Trees, moving onto Dark, Bad Place.


 


At the end of the turn I refreshed my cards and raised my threat to 31.


 


Turn Two kicked off with adding a resource to my heroes before I drew A Test Of Will (making another Light Of Valinor the top card).

I committed Frodo (for 2), Glorfindel (for 3 without exhausting) and Westfold Horse-Breeder (for 1) before I drew Wall Of Trees. I committed 6 willpower against 1 threat so 4 progress explored Wall Of Trees, sending it to the victory display, and 1 progress explored stage 2B. I travelled to Choked With Brambles.


 


After exhausting Gandalf's Staff to add 1 resource to Glorfindel I ended the turn by refreshing my cards and raising my threat to 32.


 


Turn Three began with each hero gaining a resource before I drew Light Of Valinor (making the other Light of Valinor the top card).


 


I paid 2 from Glorfindel to play Bilbo Baggins (who searched my deck for Wizard Pipe, making Elrond's Counsel the top card) and paid 1 from Gandalf to play Wizard Pipe on himself.

After exhausting Gandalf's Staff to draw Straight Shot (making Arwen Undomiel the top card) I ended the turn by refreshing my cards and raising my threat to 34.


 


Turn Five started with adding resources before I drew Arwen Undomiel (making Rivendell Blade the top card). I exhausted Wizard Pipe to move the Rivendell Blade to my hand and make Arwen Undomiel the top card.


 


I paid 2 from Gandalf to play Arwen Undomiel (making Gandalf's Staff the top card) and paid 1 from Aragorn to play another Rivendell Blade on Glorfindel.


 


I committed Arwen Undomiel (for 2, adding +1 defence to Gandalf), Bilbo (for 2), Frodo (for 2) and Glorfindel (for 3 without exhausting) before I drew 2 copies of Deep Gulley. I committed 9 willpower against 4 threat so explored stage 2, forcing me to move to Dark Bad Place.


 


After travelling to a Deep Gulley I exhausted Gandalf's Staff to draw Gandalf's Staff (making Quick Strike the top card) and ended the turn by refreshing my cards and raising my threat to 35.


 


Turn Six began with adding resources before I drew Quick Strike (making Unexpected Courage the top card).


 


I paid 1 resource each from Gandalf and Glorfindel to play Unexpected Courage on Aragorn (making Elrond's Counsel the top card).


 


I committed Arwen Undomiel (for 2, adding +1 defence to Gandalf), Bilbo (for 2), Frodo (for 2) and Glorfindel (for 3 without exhausting) before I drew Gildor Inglorion and exhausted Aragorn (who immediately refreshed thanks to Unexpected Courage). I committed 9 willpower against 2 threat so 4 progress explored Deep Gulley, sending it to the victory display, and the next 3 explored Dark Bad Place. Thanks to having 5 VP in the victory display I moved to stage 3. Stage 3 added Old Man Willow and Withywindle to the staging area.


 


I opted to travel to Withywindle.


 


Old Man Willow attacked Westfold Horse-Breeder, discarding a Wall of Trees and raising my threat to 36 and killing the Westfold Horse-Breeder.


 


Aragorn, Gandalf, Gildor and Glorfindel attacked Old Man Willow, inflicting 11 damage (thanks to Glorfindel and Aragorn knocking his defence down to 0).


 


After exhausting Gandalf's Staff to draw Elrond's Counsel (making Galadriel's Handmaiden the top card) I refreshed my cards and raised my threat to 37 before I paid 1 from Frodo to retain the services of Gildor.


 


Turn Seven began with each hero gaining a resource before I drew Galadriel''s Handmaiden (making Bilbo Baggins the top card).


 


I paid 1 from Gandalf and Glorfindel to play Galadriel's Handmaiden (lowering my threat to 36).


 


I committed Aragorn (for 2 refreshing with Unexpected Courage), Arwen (for 2, adding +1 defence to Gandalf), Bilbo (for 2), Frodo (for 2), Galadriel's Handmaiden (for 2), Gildor (for 3) and Glorfindel (for 3 without exhausting) before I drew Ending And Failing, which raised my threat to 38, and Tom Bombadil (who committed to the quest for 3). I then played 2 copies of Elrond's Counsel to add 2 willpower to Glorfindel and lower my threat to 32. I committed 19 willpower against 5 threat so 5 progress was added to Withywindle, exploring it and sending it to the victory display and adding 9 progress to stage 3B before raising my threat to 33.


 


Old Man Willow attacked Gandalf (although I exhausted Gandalf's Staff to discard the shadow card), inflicting 1 damage before Glorfindel hit back, inflicting 3 more damage.


 


At the end of the turn I refreshed everything, paid 1 from Frodo and raised my threat to 34. I then discarded Tom Bombadil and reshuffled the encounter discard pile into the encounter deck.


 


Turn Eight began with each hero gaining a resource before I drew Bilbo Baggins (making Legolas the top card).


 


I paid 5 from Aragorn to play Legolas (making Dunedain Hunter the top card).


 


At this point I opted to take a risk and commit everyone for a total of 20 willpower and drew Swaying Without Wind, which moved a Deep Gulley from the victory display back to the staging area. I committed 20 willpower against 7 threat so made 13 progress, more than enough to complete stage 3 and win the quest.


 


I did enough damage to Old Man Willow to gain Old Bogey-Stories for the campaign.


 


My final score was


 


Completed Rounds (7): 70.


Threat: 34.


Wounds on heroes: 1.


Total VP: 5.


Total Score: 100.

Turn One began with each hero gaining a resource before I drew Shadowfax.


 


I paid 1 from Glorfindel to play Light of Valinor on him and paid 1 from Aragorn and Gandalf to play Gandalf's Staff on Gandalf.


 


At the end of the turn I exhausted Gandalfs Staff to add 1 resource to Gandalf and raised my threat to 32 before adding 1 progress to stage 1B, exploring it. Stage 2 added Hollow Circle to the staging area before I drew Ancient Barrow and added it to the staging area.


 


Turn Two began with each hero gaining a resource before I drew Galadriel's Handmaiden.


 


I paid 1 from Aragorn to play Rohan Warhorse on Aragorn and paid 2 from Gandalf and 1 from Glorfindel to play Shadowfax on Gandalf.


 


I committed Frodo (for 2), Gandalf (for 3, exhausting Shadowfax to refresh) and Glorfindel (for 3, without exhausting) before drawing I'm Waiting For You, which surged to Stone Ring. I committed 8 willpower against 7 threat so 1 progress was added to stage 1B.


 


I opted to travel to Stone Ring.


 


At the end of the turn I exhausted Gandalf's Staff to add 1 resource to Glorfindel, refreshed my cards and raised my threat to 34.


 


Turn Three began with each hero gaining a resource before I drew Rivendell Blade.


 


I paid 2 from Glorfindel to play Galadriel's Handmaiden (who lowered my threat to 33) and paid 1 from Aragorn to play Rivendell Blade on Glorfindel.


 


I committed Frodo (for 2), Galadriel's Handmaiden (for 2), Gandalf (for 3, exhausting Shadowfax to refresh) and Glorfindel (for 3, without exhausting) before drawing North Downs. I committed 10 willpower against 6 threat so added 3 progress to Stone Circle, exploring it and added another progress to stage 2B.


 


I travelled to Hollow Circle, putting a Dark-Wight into play engaged with myself.


 


The Dark-Wight attacked Gandalf, inflicting no damage before Aragorn and Glorfindel inflicted 6 damage on it.


 


I ended the turn by refreshing my cards and raising my threat to 35.


 


Turn Four began with my heroes gaining a resource each before I drew Straight Shot.


 


I paid 1 from Gandalf to play Wizard Pipe on Gandalf (from the top of the deck) and paid 1 from Glorfindel to play Westfold Horse-Breeder (who added another copy of Shadowfax to my hand).


 


I committed Frodo (for 2), Galadriel's Handmaiden (for 2), Gandalf (for 3, refreshing with Shadowfax), Glorfindel (for 3, without exhausting) and Westfold Horse-Breeder (for 1) before I drew Gildor Inglorion. I committed 11 willpower against 3 threat so 3 progress explored Hollow Circle, sending it to the victory display, and 5 progress was added to stage 2B.


 


I opted to travel to North Downs.


 


I exhausted Gandalf's Staff to discard the shadow card before the Dark-Wight attacked Gandalf, inflicting no damage before Aragorn and Glorfindel attacked and killed the Dark-Wight.


 


At the end of the turn I refreshed my cards, paid 1 from Frodo to keep Gildor in play and raised my threat to 37.


 


Turn Five began with each hero gaining a resource before I drew Bilbo Baggins.


 


I paid 2 from Gandalf to play Bilbo Baggins then paid 1 from Aragorn to play another Rivendell Blade (from the top of the deck) on Glorfindel.

I committed 18 willpower against 3 threat so 5 progress explored North Downs and 10 progress blew through stage 2B. Stage 3 added Standing Stones to the staging area and shuffled the encounter discard pile and several Great Barrows into the encounter deck.


 


I opted to travel to Standing Stones, searching the encounter deck for a Great Barrow and putting it into the staging area. The Great Barrow removed my cards from the quest and moved me to a seperate stage 4, which ended the quest phase but forced me to add a Cold-Wight to the staging area and (unfortunately) discard all my Allies but Gildor.


 


I opted to engage the Cold-Wight, exhausting Gandalf's Staff to remove the shadow card so the attack did 1 damage before Aragorn and Glorfindel attacked and killed the Cold-Wight.


 


I ended the turn by refreshing my cards, paying 1 from Frodo and raising my threat to 32.

SOLO SAGA: JOURNEY IN THE DARK.


 


My heroes were Aragorn (Tactics), Frodo Baggins (TBR, with The One Ring), Gandalf (with Tireless Ranger) and Glorfindel (Spirit). This gave me 31 threat and a opening hand containing Bilbo Baggins, Flame Of Arnor x2, Ho! Tom Bombadil!, Light Of Valinor, Quick Strike and Sting.


 


Quest set-up consisted of attaching Old Bogey-Stories to Frodo and Leaf-Wrapped Lembas to Aragorn, putting Grievous Wound into play and adding The Argonath and Sarn Gedir into the staging area.


 


Turn One began with each hero gaining a resource before I drew Flame of Arnor.


 


I paid 1 from Glorfindel to play Light Of Valinor on him and paid 1 from Aragorn and Gandalf to play Sting on Frodo.


 


I committed Aragorn (for 2), Frodo (for 3), Gandalf (for 3), Glorfindel (for 3, without exhausting) and drew Orcs Of The White Hand, for no effect. I committed 11 willpower against 4 threat so added 7 progress to stage 1B.

I started Turn Two by adding a resource to my heroes and drawing Straight Shot.


 


I paid 1 from Glorfindel to play Westfold Horse-Breeder from the top of my deck (whose ability put Shadowfax into my hand).


 


I committed Aragorn (for 2), Gandalf (for 3) and Glorfindel (for 3 without exhausting) before I drew Followed By Night, which did nothing but surge to River Anduin. I committed 8 willpower against 3 threat so 4 progress explored Sarn Gebir (adding 1 damage to Aragorn, Gandalf and Glorfindel and attaching Grievous Wound to Glorfindel) and 1 progress was added to stage 1B.

I committed Aragorn (for 2), Frodo (for 3), Gandalf (for 3, refreshing with Shadowfax), Glorfindel (for 3, without exhausting) and Westfold Horse-Breeder (for 1) before I drew Pursued By The Enemy, which did nothing but raise my threat to 35 (since I forgot the effect on River Anduin) and surge to another River Anduin. I committed 12 willpower against 4 threat so added 2 progress to The Argonath and 6 to stage 1B, exploring it.


 


Stage 2 removed Frodo (and all his attached cards).


 


I skipped the travel phase and proceeded to end the turn by refreshing my cards and raising my threat to 35 before I shuffled Frodo's Choice and Seat Of Seeing into the encounter discard pile and put that on the bottom of the encounter deck. I proceeded to Guard The Hobbits and moved both of the River Anduins to my new staging area.


 


Turn Four began with each hero gaining a resource before I drew Honor Guard.


 


I paid 2 from Gandalf to play the Honor Guard on top of my deck, then paid 2 from Glorfindel to play Bilbo Baggins (who put a Wizard Pipe into my hand) and paid 1 from Gandalf to play the Wizard Pipe on him.


 


I committed Aragorn (for 2), Bilbo Baggins (for 2), Gandalf (for 3, refreshing with Shadowfax), Glorfindel (for 3, without exhausting) and Westfold Horse-Breeder (for 1) before drawing The Ring Draws Them, which surged to Uruk-Hai Hunter, who immediately attacked Gandalf, doing no damage. I committed 11 willpower against 6 threat so I discarded the top 5 cards of the encounter deck and refreshed my heroes.


 


The Fellowship travelled to one of the River Anduins before I raised my threat to 36.

I committed 15 willpower against 1 threat so discarded 14 cards, the fourth card was Frodo's Choice, which returned Frodo (and his cards) to play and added Parth Galen to the staging area.


 


I opted to engage the Uruk-Hai Archer, whose Archery was negated by one of the Honor Guard before I exhausted Shadowfax to refresh Gandalf and the Uruk-Hai Archer attacked Gandalf, doing no damage before Frodo and Glorfindel attacked and killed the Uruk-Hai Archer (I exhausted the other Honor Guard to negate the damage from Grievous Wound on Glorfindel).


 


At the end of the turn I refreshed my cards and raised my threat to 39.

The Fellowship travelled to Parth Galen, adding a Uruk-Hai Tracker to the staging area.


 


I negated the Archery damage with one of the Honor Guards before the Uruk-Hai Tracker attacked Gandalf, inflicting no damage before Aragorn, Defender of Rammas and Legolas attacked and killed the Uruk-Hai Tracker. Legolas's ability allowed me to draw A Test Of Will.


 


I ended the turn by refreshing ,my cards and raising my threat to 40.

THE THREE HUNTERS: PERIL IN PELARGIR.


 


Since Sands of Harad has been released I decided to try out the new Gimli and Legolas cards. The plan is to play through the quests from PiP with just the Three Hunters as heroes (using a combination of the different variants).


 


The combo for this attempt is Aragorn (Lore), Gimli (Leadership) and Legolas (Spirit), with 32 threat and a opening hand containing Dwarven Shield, Mirkwood Long-Knife, Silver Harp, Warden Of Arnor, Warden Of Healing and Wingfoot. I opted to take a mulligan, drawing Armoured Destrier, Dwarven Shield, Errand-Rider, Ranger of Cardolan, Sneak Attack and Wingfoot.


 


Quest set-up consisted of making The Leaping Fish the active location, adding a Harbour Thug to the staging area and adding Alcaron's Scroll to Gimli.


 


Turn One began with each hero gaining a resource before I drew Warden Of Healing.


 


I paid 1 from Aragorn to play Wingfoot on himself.


 


I discarded Lost In The City, then committed Aragorn (naming Location for Wingfoot), Gimli and Legolas (discarding Ranger of Cardolan to refresh Gimli).


 


I drew Collateral Damage and discarded Harbour Storehouse and Zealous Traitor before increasing my threat to 34. The Harbour Thug engaged me.


 


I committed 8 against 0 threat so 6 progress explored The Leaping Fish and 2 progress was added to stage 1B.


 


The Harbour Thug attacked Gimli, inflicting 1 damage so I attached Alcaron's Scroll to the Harbour Thug. I paid 1 from Gimli to refresh Legolas, who attacked the Harbour Thug, inflicting 2 damage.


 


I ended the turn by refreshing my cards and raising my threat to 35.


 


Turn Two began with my heroes gaining a resource before I drew Silver Harp.


 


I paid 2 from Legolas to play Silver Harp on himself.


 


I decided to only commit Aragorn (naming Location for Wingfoot) and drew Lurking In Shadows which surged to Collateral Damage. I discarded Collateral Damage, Zealous Traitor, Market Square and Lossarnach Bandit and raised my threat to 37.


 


I committed 3 against 0 threat so added 3 progress to stage 1B.


 


The Harbour Thug attacked Gimli, doing another 1 damage before Legolas attacked and killed the Harbour Thug and sent Alcaron's Scroll to the staging area.


 


I ended the turn by refreshing my cards and raising my threat to 38.


 


Turn Three began with each of my heroes gaining a resource before I drew Unlikely Friendship.


 


I played Unlikely Friendship to draw Glorfindel and add 1 resource to Gimli, then paid 3 from Gimli to play Galadriel (who attached Steward of Gondor to Gimli) and exhausted Steward of Gondor to add resources to Gimli and paid 2 from Aragorn to play Warden of Healing (exhausting him to heal 1 damage from Gimli).


 


I committed Aragorn (naming Enemy for Wingfoot), and Gimli.


 


I drew Harbour Thug (refreshing Aragorn).


 


I committed 5 against 2 threat so added 3 progress to stage 1B, exploring it. Stage 2 added Alcaron's Scroll to the Harbour Thug.


 


I engaged the Harbour Thug, who attacked Galadriel, drawing City Streets for 2 attack and killing Galadriel before Aragorn and Legolas killed the Harbour Thug, returning Alcaron's Scroll to the staging area.


 


I ended the turn by refreshing my cards and raising my threat to 39.


 


Turn Four began with my heroes gaining resources before I drew A Test Of Will.


 


I exhausted Steward of Gondor to add 2 resources to Gimli, then paid 4 from him to play Dwarven Shield and Armoured Detrier on Gimli. I ended the phase by exhausting Warden of Healing to heal a damage from Gimli.


 


I committed Aragonr (naming Enemy for Wingfoot), Gimli and Legolas (discarding Errand-Rider and returning it with Silver Harp to refresh Gimli).


 


I drew Market Square.


 


I committed 8 against 3 willpower so added 5 progress to stage 2B.


 


I ended the turn by paying 1 from Gimli to travel to Market Square, then refreshed my cards and raised my threat to 40.


 


Turn Five began with adding resources before I drew Arwen Undomiel.


 


I exhausted Steward to add 2 resources to Gimli, then paid 2 from Legolas to play Arwen Undomiel and paid 1 from Gimli to play Errand-Rider.


 


I committed Aragorn (naming Enemy for Wingfoot), Arwen Undomiel (adding 1 defence to Gimli), Gimli and Legolas (discarding Sneak Attack and returning it with Silver Harp to refresh Gimli).


 


I drew Pelargir Docks.


 


I committed 8 against 4 willpower so 1 progress explored Market Square and 3 progress was added to stage 2B.


 


I travelled to Pelargir Docks, then ended the turn by refreshing my cards and raising my threat to 41.


 


Turn Five began with adding resources before I drew Warden of Arnor.


 


I exhausted Steward of Gondor to add 2 resources to Gimli, then paid 1 from Legolas to play Warden of Arnor on him.


 


I committed Aragorn (naming Enemy for Wingfoot), Arwen Undomiel (adding 1 defence to Gimli), Gimli and Legolas (discarding Sneak Attack and returning it with Silver Harp to refresh Gimli).


 


I drew Pickpocket (which refreshed Aragorn).


 


I committed 8 against 1 threat so 3 progress explored Pelargir Docks and 4 progress left me with 1 progress left to get through stage 2B.


 


I engaged the Pickpocket, which forced me to dicard a resource from Gimli and discard A Test Of Will (which I retiurned to my deck with Silver Harp) before he attacked Gimli, drawing Harbour Thug for no effect and doing no damage.


 


Aragorn attacked and killed the Pickpocket.


 


I ended the turn by refreshing my cards and raising my threat to 42. Since there are still a couple of copies of Collateral Damage in the deck I used Aragorn's ability to lower my threat to 32.


 


Turn Six began with adding resources before I drew Unlikely Friendship.


 


I exhausted Steward to add 2 resources to Gimli and discarded Unlikely Friendship to add 1 resource to Legolas and draw Narvi's Belt before I paid 2 from Gimli to play Narvi's Belt on Gimli.


 


I committed Aragorn (naming Enemy for Wingfoot), Arwen Undomiel (adding 1 defence to Gimli), Gimli and Legolas (discarding Sneak Attack and returning it with Silver Harp to refresh Gimli).


 


I drew Collateral Damage and discarded Pickpocket, Umbar Assassin, City Streets, Harbour Storehouse, Pickpocket, Zealous Traitor, Lurking In Shadows and Lossarnach Bandit) and raised my theat to 36.


 


I committed 8 against 0 threat so added 8 progress to stage 1B and exhausted Gimli to add Alcaron's Scroll to him. This explored stage 2B.


 


Stage 3 added a Harbour Thug to the staging area.


 


The Harbour Thug engaged me and attacked the Errand-Rider, killing him.


 


I ended the turn by refreshing my cards and raising my threat to 37.


 


Turn Seven began with heroes gaining resources before I drew Gandalf (Core).


 


I exhausted Streward to add 2 resources to Gimli, then paid 5 from him to play Gandalf, who killed the Harbour Thug.


 


I committed Aragorn (naming Location for Wingfoot), Arwen Undomiel (adding +1 defence to Gimli), Gandalf, Gimli, Legolas (discarding A Test Of will and returning it with Silver Harp to refresh Gimli) and Warden of Healing.


 


I drew City Streets, which surged to Local Trouble, which attached to Legolas.


 


I committed 12 willpower against 2 threat so added 10 progress to stage 3B,


 


I ended the turn by refreshing my cards and raising my threat to 39.


 


Turn Eight began with each hero gaining a resource before I drew Mirkwood Long-Knife.


 


I exhausted Steward to add 2 resources to Gimli and paid 2 from Legolas to play Mirkwood Long-Knife on Legolas.


 


I committed Aragorn (naming Location for Wingfoot), Arwen Undomiel (adding +1 defence to Gimli), Gandalf, Gimli, Legolas (discarding A Test Of will and returning it with Silver Harp to refresh Gimli and raising my threat to 40) and Warden of Healing.


 


I drew Harbour Storehouse.


 


I committed 9 willpower against 3 threat so added 9 progress to stage 3B, exploring it and winning the quest.


 


This deck worked better than I expected.


 


The final score was:


Completed Turns (7): 70.


Total Threat: 40.


Total VP: 1.


Total Score: 109.

The Southron Company attacked the Ranger of Cardolan, killing him.

I drew Watcher In The Woods, which raised my threat to 36 and surged to Blocking Wargs, which added 1 damage to Aragorn, Celador, Gimli and Legolas and surged to Ithilien Guardian (which came into play committed to the quest) which surged to Blocking Wargs (which added 1 more damage to Aragorn, Celador, Gimli, Ithilien Guardsman and Legolas), which surged to Lost Companion (which removed Gimli from the quest).


 


After all that I committed 10 against 0 threat so 3 progress explored Secluded Glade and 7 progress was added to stage 1B.


 


Looking at the numbers and realizing that whichever hero I decided to defend with was guaranteed to die I decided to quit the game on turn two.

INTRUDERS IN CHETWOOD.


 


After going over the quests I have attempted I noticed that there are a lot of the last couple of cycles which I haven't attempted. In a effort to combat that I decided to skip a few quests.


 


Deck #1 contained Aragorn (Leadership), Celeborn and Galadriel, with 32 threat and a opening hand containing Arwen Undomiel, Galadriel's Handmaiden, Mirror Of Galadriel, Nalth Guide, O Lorien! and Sword That Was Broken.


 


Deck #2 contained Haldir of Lorien, Legolas (Tactics) and Mirlonde, with 24 threat and a opening hand (after a mulligan) containing Cloak Of Lorien, Daughter of the Nimrodel x2, Galadhrim Minstrel, ,Gandalf (Core) and Weather-Stained Cloak.


 


Quest set-up consisted of putting Iarion into play with deck #1 and adding Orc War Party, Rugged Country and Shrouded Hills to the staging area before making deck #1 the first player.


 


Turn One began with each hero gaining a resource before deck #1 drew Nenya and deck #2 drew Wingfoot.


 


Deck #1 paid 1 from Aragorn to play Nenya on Galadriel, paid 1 from Celeborn to play O Lorien! on himself and paid 1 from Galadriel to play Mirror of Galadriel on herself, then exhausted Mirror of Galadriel to add Unexpected Courage to hand and discard Galadtriel's Handmaiden before exhausting O Lorien!.


 


Deck #2 paid 1 from Mirlonde to play Galadhrim Minstrel (who put The Tree People into hand), paid 1 from Haldir to play Wingfoot on himself and played Weather-Stained Cloak on Aragorn.


 


I committed Aragorn (for 2), Celeborn (for 7 with Galadriel and Nenya buffing him), Galadhrim Minstrel (for 2), Haldir of Lorien (for 2, naming Enemy for Wingfoot), Iarion (for 1) and Mirlonde (for 2).


 


I drew Lost In The Wilderness (which I placed both hands under but buffed Iarion) and Pressing Needs (which raised deck #1's threat to 34 and deck #2's to 26 and made Lost In The Wilderness the active quest).


 


I committed 16 willpower against 9 threat so added 4 progress to Lost In The Wilderness, exploring it and putting both hands back into play).


 


I opted to travel to Rugged Country.


 


At the end of the rurn I refreshed everything, raised deck #1's threat to 36 and deck #2's to 28 and made deck #2 the first player.

GOING RETRO: A MASSING IN OSGILIATH.

 

I opted to go with a revised version of the original deck I used way back when I first bought the game. My heroes were old school Denethor, Eowyn and Gimli. They worked as well as I hoped since letting Gimli take a undefended hit on turn 1 left me without getting swamped. The game took 11 turns (due to having to drastically slow down my questing in order to get a Ranger of Ithilien before stage 3) but I never seemed to have any troubles.

A Shadow Of The Past.


 


For this saga run through I decided to try another retro pair of hero line-ups. The first couple of practice attempts were notable for the complete inability of Deck #1 to draw Light of Valinor, making Spirit Glorfindel somewhat useless. After due consideration I swapped him out for a hero who could provide much-needed resource smoothing.


 


Deck #1's heroes were Aragorn (Lore), Arwen Undomiel and Eowyn (Spirit) and Deck #2's heroes were Elladan, Elrohir and Legolas (Tactics).


 


The two decks seemed to work well together, Arwen's ability (combined with a Silver Harp in the opening hand) made for a far smoother game than I was expecting (although most of the extra resources were going onto Elrohir).


 


On turn six I played a second Northern Tracker and discarded 5 locations, leaving a Black Rider in the staging area for deck #2 to deal with and blow through stage 2.


 


All in al, the game took eight turns to complete, with Mr. Underhill and Gandalf's Delay being added to the Campaign Pool.

THE THREE HUNTERS: MASSING AT OSGILIATH.


 


After realizing the amount of quests I haven't attempted yet I decided to go back to basics.


 


My heroes were Aragorn (Lore), Gimli (Leadership) and Legolas (Spirit), with 32 threat and a opening hand (after a mulligan) containing Dunedain Warning, Mirkwood Long-Knife, Sneak Attack, Warden of Healing x2 and Wingfoot.


 


Setup for the quest consisted of putting a Snaga Scouts, Wainriders and Wolves From Mordor into the staging area.


 


Turn One began with adding a resource to each of my heroes before I drew Dunedain Warning.


 


I paid 1 from Aragorn to play Wingfoot on him and paid 1 from Gimli to play Dunedain Warning on him.


 


I committed Aragorn (for 2, naming Location for Wingfoot), Gimli (for 2) and Legolas (for 1, discarding a Warden of Healing to refresh Gimli and give him +1 willpower) before drawing Captured Watchtower (refreshing Aragorn). I committed 6 willpower against 5 threat and added 1 progress to stage 1B.


 


I engaged the Snaga Scouts and Wolves From Mordor.


 


The Snaga Scouts made a undefended attack on Aragorn, drawing Massing At Osgiliath for no effect and inflicting 1 damage.


 


The Wolves From Mordor attacked Gimli, drawing Wainriders for no effect and doing 1 damage.


 


Aragorn attacked and killed the Snaga Scouts before I refreshed my cards, raised my threat to 33 and ended the turn.


 


Turn Three began with each of my heroes gaining a resource before I drew Unlikely Friendship.


 


I immediately played Unlikely Friendship and drew Arwen Undomiel before adding 1 resource to Aragorn.


 


I paid 2 from Aragorn to play Warden of Healing, then exhausted him to heal 1 damage from Aragorn and Gimli before paying 2 from Legolas to play Arwen Undomiel.


 


I committed Aragorn (for 2, naming Enemy for Wingfoot), Arwen Undomiel (for 2, adding +1 defence to Gimli), Gimli (for 2) and Legolas (for 1, discarding Mirkwood Long-Knife to refresh and add +1 willpower to Gimli).


 


I drew Dark Pursuit, which gave the staging area +1 threat for a total of 4 threat against 8 threat so 4 progress was added to stage 1B.


 


The Wolves From Mordor attacked Gimli (who paid 1 to refresh and add +1 attack to Legolas), drawing Pelennor Fields for no effect and doing no damage.


 


Legolas attacked and killed the Wolves From Mordor before I refreshed my cards and raised my threat to 34 to end the turn.


 


Turn Three began with each hero gaining a resource before I drew Armoured Destrier.


 


With no planning I proceeded to commit Aragorn (for 2, naming Enemy for Wingfoot), Arwen Undomiel (for 2, adding +1 defence to Gimli), Gimli (for 2), Legolas (for 1, discarding Sneak Attack to refresh and add +1 willpower to Gimli) and Warden of Arnor (for 1) before drawing Ranger of Ithilien, which I put into play under my control, exhausted and committed (for 2) before surging to Ruins Of Osgilath.


 


I committed 9 willpower against 6 threat so added 2 progress to stage 1B, exploring it.


 


I opted to travel to Ruins of Osgiliath before I refreshed my cards and raised my threat to 35 to end the turn.


 


Turn Four began with each hero gaining a resource before I drew Silver Harp.


 


I paid 2 from Legolas to play Silver Harp on him.


 


I committed Aragorn (for 2, naming Enemy for Wingfoot), Arwen Undomiel (for 2, adding +1 defence to Gimli), Gimli (for 2), Legolas (for 1, discarding Dunedain Warning to refresh and add +1 willpower to Gimli, then exhausting Silver Harp to return the Dunedain Warning to hand) and Warden of Healing (for 1) before I drew Uruk Vanguard (which refreshed Aragorn).


 


I committed 9 willpower against 5 threat so added 2 progress to Ruins of Osgiliath, exploring it and added 2 progress to stage 2B.


 


I was forced to engage the Wainriders.


 


The Wainriders attacked Gimli (I paid 1 from Gimli to refresh and add +1 attack to Legolas), drawing Massing At Osgiliath for no effect and doing no damage.


 


Aragorn and Legolas attacked and killed the Wainriders before I refreshed my cards and raised my threat to 36 to end the turn.


 


Turn Five began with adding a resource my heroes before I drew Steward of Gondor.


 


I paid 2 from Gimli to play Steward of Gondor on Gimli, then exhausted Steward to add 2 resources to Gimli and paid them to play Armoured Destrier on Gimli.


 


I committed Aragorn (for 2, naming Enemy for Wingfoot), Arwen (for 2, adding +1 defence to Gimli), Gimli (for 3 after buff), Legolas (for 1, discarding Armoured Destrier to add +1 willpower and refresh Gimli, then exhausting Silver Harp to return Armoured Destrier to hand) and Warden of Healing (for 1) before drawing Wainriders (which refreshed Aragorn).


 


I committed 8 willpower against 5 threat so added 3 progress to stage 2B, exploring it and moving to stage 3,


 


I engaged the Wainriders, who attacked Gimli (who paid 1 to refresh and give +1 attack to Legolas), drawing Wainrider Captain for no effect and doing no damage.


 


Aragorn and Legolas attacked and killed the Wainriders before I refreshed my cards and raised my threat to 36 and ended the turn.


 


Turn Six began with adding a resource to my heroes before I drew Unlikely Friendship.


 


I played Unlikely Friendship to draw Sword That Was Broken and add 1 resource to Gimli.


 


After exhausting Steward to add 2 resources to Gimli I paid 2 from Gimli to play Armoured Destrier and paid 3 from Gimli to play Sword That Was Broken on Aragorn.


 


I started the quest phase by discarding the Ranger of Ithilien, then committed Aragorn (for 3), Arwen Undomiel (for 3, adding +1 defence to Gimli) and Warden of Healing (for 2) before I drew Morgulduin.


 


I committed 8 willpower against 4 threat so added 4 progress to stage 3B, exploring it.


 


Stage 4 added the Witch King to the staging area.


 


I travelled to Captured Watchtower.


 


I opted to engage the Witch King, who attacked Gimli, drawing Snaga Scout for no effect and inflicting 2 damage.


 


I opted to keep the Witch King engaged with me and raised my threat to 39 before I refreshed my cards and raised my threat to 40 to end the turn.


 


Turn Seven began with adding a resource to each of my heroes before I drew Gandalf (Core).


 


After exhausting Steward to add 2 resources to Gimli I paid 3 from Aragorn and 2 from Legolas to play Gandalf, then used his ability to draw Mirkwood Long-Knife, Warden of Healing and Galadriel. I then paid 3 from Gimli to play Galadriel (who put Celebrian's Stone into play attached to Aragorn) and paid 2 from Aragorn to play Warden of Healing.


 


I committed Aragorn (for 5, naming Enemy for Wingfoot), Arwen Undomiel (for 3, adding +1 defence to Gimli), Galadriel (for 4), Gandalf (for 5), Gimli (for 3 after buff), Legolas (for 2, discarding Mirkwood Long-Knife to refresh and add +1 willpower to Gimli, then return the Mirkwood Long-Knife to hand with Silver Harp) and Warden of Healing x2 (for 2 each) before I drew Ruins of Osgiliath.


 


I committed 26 willpower against 4 threat, adding 2 progress to Captured Watchtower, exploring it and another 20 progress to stage 4B, exploring it and winning the game.


 


The deck seemed to work well. I'm thinking that some cards may need to be dumped (Mirkwood Long-Knife fir example which did nothing but be discarded and take up room in my hand) but the deck held up well.


 


My final score was: Completed Rounds (6): 60 + Total Threat: 39 + Wounds on Heroes: 2 = Total Score: 101.

After playing 4 games of Into Ithilien I was starting to think that the quest was unbeatable. Then I noticed that I've beaten Into Ithilien with a Aragorn/Gimli/Legolas deck already (it's the second post on this page) so I'll merrily skip banging my head against it again and proceed to Siege of Cair Andros. I'm also considering going back to playing two-handed again.

The Three Hunters: Siege of Cair Andros.

 

For this game I decided to switch to a deck using the Tactics versions of Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas. This gave me a threat of 32 and a opening hand containing Azain Silverbeard, Black Arrow, Defender of Rammas, Dunedain Hunter, Knight of Minas Tirith and Soldier of Dol Amroth.

 

Quest setup consisted of adding The Approach, The Banks and The Citadel to the staging area.

 

Turn One began with adding a resource to my heroes before I drew Raven-Winged Helm.

 

I paid 1 from Aragorn and Legolas to play Soldier of Dol Amroth, before paying 1 from Gimli to play Defender of Rammas.

 

I committed Aragorn (for 2), Defender of Rammas (for 4) and Gimli (for 2).

 

I drew The Masters Malice, which did nothing (thanks to going mono-sphere).

 

I committed 8 defence against 6 threat so added 2 progress to stage 1B.

 

I travelled to The Banks then ended the turn by refreshing my cards and raised my threat to 33.

 

Turn Two began with adding a resource to my heroes before I drew Honour Guard.

 

I played Dunedain Hunter (who put a Orc Scramblers into play engaged with me), then paid 1 from each of my heroes to play Knight of Minas Tirith, who immediately attacked and killed the Orc Scramblers.

 

I committed Aragorn (for 2), Defender of Rammas (for 4), Dunedain Hunter (for 1) and Gimli (for 2).

 

I drew Scourge of Modor, which forced me to discard Dunedain Hunter from the top of my deck and add nothing to the total threat in play.

 

I committed 9 defence against 5 threat so added 3 progress to The Banks (sending it to the victory display and putting stage 2B out of play) and added 1 progress to stage 1B.

 

I opted to travel to The Approach before ending the turn by refreshing my cards and raising my threat to 34.

 

Turn Three began with each hero gaining a resource before I drew Defender of Rammas.

 

I paid 1 from Legolas and Gimli to play Defender of Rammas and played Black Arrow on Legolas.

 

I committed Aragorn (for 2), Defender of Rammas x2 (for 4 each) and Gimli (for 2).

 

I drew Battering Ram, which raised my threat to 36 and added 3 damage to The Approach.

 

I committed 12 defence versus 5 threat so added 7 progress to The Approach (which moved it to the victory display and removed stage 3B from play).

 

I travelled to The Citadel.

 

I engaged the Battering Ram, who attacked Defender of Dol Amroth. The shadow card was Orc Arsonist, which added 1 attack and forced me to draw Siege Raft, which added another 2 attack. The final attack really, really killed the Defender of Dol Amroth.

 

Dunedain Hunter, Knight of Minas Tirith and Legolas attacked and killed the Battering Ram. Legolas's ability added 2 progress to The Citadel before I ended the turn by refreshing my cards and raising my threat to 37.

 

Turn Four began with each hero gaining a resource before I drew Deorwine.

 

I paid 2 from Aragorn and 1 from Gimli and Legolas to play Deorwine.

 

I committed Aragorn (for 2), Defender of Rammas x2 (for 4 each), Deorwine (for 3) and Gimli (for 2).

 

I drew Scourge of Mordor and discarded Gather Information for no additional threat.

 

I committed 15 defence against 0 threat so added 9 progress to The Citadel, exploring it (sending it to the victory display and removing stage 4 from the game) and added 6 progress to stage 1B, exploring it.

 

Stage 5 is a Battle stage (dammit, this deck is built for siege) and forced me to draw Orc Ambush, which did nothing.

 

At the end of the round I refreshed my cards and raised my threat to 38.

 

Turn Five began with adding a resource to my heroes before I drew Knight of Minas Tirith.

 

I paid 1 from Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas to play Knight of Minas Tirith.

 

Knowing that I'm 15 progress away from winning the quest I committed Aragorn (for 3), Defender of Rammas x2 (for 1 each), Deorwine (for 1), Dunedain Hunter (for 3), Gimli (for 2), Knight of Minas Tirith x2 (for 3 each) and Legolas (for 3) for 20 attack.

 

I drew a Mumak for 4 threat so added 16 progress to stage 5B, exploring it and winning the game.

 

This was less of a struggle than I though it would be. I'm guessing I was really lucky getting so few enemies and the 2 early game Defenders of Rammas got me a fast enough start to win the game.

 

My final score was: Completed Rouds (4): 40 + Total Threat: 38 – VP: 6 = 72

A SHADOW OF THE PAST (Four Player)

 

I was invited to another multi-player game and after finding out that all the Fellowship were taken (opted to bring a deck with Arwen Undomiel, Elladan and Elrohir).

 

The hero line-ups were:

Merry, Pippin and Sam Gamgee (all from Black Riders).

Aragorn (Lore) and the new versions of Gimli and Legolas.

Boromir (Leadership), new Prince Imrahil and Beregond.

Arwen, Elladan and Elrohir.

 

The game went well, nobody died and I soon discovered that everyone had packed enough copies of Elf-Friend to go around so that they could try and get the bonus resources from Arwen after I played a first turn Silver Harp). 

 

THE OLD FOREST.

This went better than I expected.  Having 3 Northern Trackers in play early on (thanks to a mixture of Boromir shipping resources via Errand-Rider to Arwen and Legolas) meant that the locations were little or no problem and all that was left to do was beat on Old-Man Willow and quest for the finish line (despite Beregond winding up on one wound on the last turn).

Added 1 resource to each hero.

Deck #1 drew Galadhrim Minstrel.

Deck #2 drew Galadriel.

 

PLANNING PHASE.

Deck #1 discarded Ring of Barahir to add 1 resource to Aragorn, then paid 2 from him to play Galadhrim Minstrel, who pulled Elrond's Counsel out of deck and into hand.

Deck #2 exhausted Steward to add 2 resources to Elrohir, then paid 3 from Elrohir to play Galadriel, who pulled Sword That Was Broken out of deck and played it on Aragorn.

Deck #2 paid 2 from Elrohir and 1 from Halbarad to play Son of Arnor.

Committed: Aragorn (for 3, naming Enemy for Wingfoot), Arwen (for 4, without exhausting), Galadhrim Minstrel (for 3), Galadriel (for 3), Halbarad (for 2), Idraen (for 3) and Northern Tracker (for 2, adding 1 progress to Glade of Cleansing and Overgrown Trail).

Total Threat: 20.

 

At this point in the game I decided that the odds of me getting out of the location lock was next to impossible so I decided to quit.

The Druadan Forest.

 

After some consideration I decided to go back to playing solo.

 

My heroes were Aragorn (Tactics), Gandalf and Glorfindel (Spirit), with 31 threat and a opening hand containing Defender of Rammas, Flame of Arnor. Gandalf's Staff, Rivendell Blade, Straight Shot and Unexpected Courage. I opted to risk taking a mulligan, drawing Dunedain Hunter, Flame of Arnor. Light of Valinor, Quick Strike, Shadowfax and Westfold Horse-Breeder, with Honour Guard as the top card of the deck.

 

Setup for the quest consisted of drawing Lost Companion, which did nothing (which was nice).

 

Turn One began with each hero gaining a resource before I drew Honour Guard, making Straight Shot the top card of my deck.

 

I paid 1 from Glorfindel to play Light of Valinor on him, then played Dunedain Hunter (who pulled a Druadan Drummer from the encounter deck and put it into play engaged with me).

 

I committed Gandalf (for 3) and Glorfindel (for 3, without exhausting) before I drew Garden of Poisons. I committed 6 willpower against 2 threat so added 4 progress to stage 1B.

 

I paid 1 from Gandalf to travel to Garden of Poisons.

 

The Druadan Drummer attacked the Dunedain Hunter, drawing Garden of Poisons for no effect and doing no damage before Aragorn and Glorfindel killed the Dunedain Drummer.

 

I ended the turn by refreshing everything before I raised my threat to 32.

 

Turn Two began with adding a resource to each of my heroes before I drew Straight Shot, making Arwen Undomiel the top card of my deck.

 

I paid 2 from Gandalf to play Arwen Undomiel from the top of my deck making Silvan Refugee the top card of my deck, then paid 2 from Aragorn and 1 from Glorfindel to play Shadowfax on Gandalf.

 

I committed Arwen Undomiel (for 2, adding +1 defence to Gandalf), Gandalf (for 3, refreshing with Shadowfax) and Glorfindel (for 3, without exhausting) before drawing Men In The Dark, which added 1 damage to Aragorn, Gandalf and Glorfindel. I committed 8 willpower against 0 threat so added 3 progress to Garden of Poisons, exploring it and added 5 progress to stage 1B.

 

I ended the turn by refreshing my cards and raising my threat to 33.

 

Turn Three began with each hero gaining a resources before I drew Silvan Refugee, making Honour Guard the top card of the deck.

 

I paid 1 from Aragorn and Gandalf to play Honour Guard from the top of my deck, making Elrond's Counsel the top card, and paid 1 from Glorfindel to play Westfold Horse-Breeder (whose ability did nothing but shuffle my deck, making Honour Guard the top card of the deck).

 

I committed Arwen Undomiel (for 2, adding 1 defence to Gandalf), Gandalf (for 3, refreshing with Shadowfax), Glorfindel (for 3, without exhausting) and Westfold Horse-Breeder (for 1) before I drew Overgrown Trail. I decided to exhaust Aragorn and Dunedain Hunter to add 6 progress to Overgrown Trail, exploring it and clearing the staging area. I committed 9 willpower against 0 threat so added 9 progress to stage 1B, more than exploring it and moving to stage 2.

 

I ended the turn by refreshing my cards and raising my threat to 34.

 

Turn Four began with each hero gaining a resource before I drew Honour Guard, making Rivendell Blade the top card of my deck.

 

I paid 1 from Glorfindel to play Silvan Refugee.

 

I committed Arwen Undomiel (for 2, adding 1 defence to Gandalf), Dunedain Hunter (for 1), Gandalf (for 3, refreshing with Shadowfax), Glorfindel (for 3, without exhausting), Silvan Refugee (for 2) and Westfold Horse-Breeder (for 1) before I drew Leaves Of Tree (which forced me to discard a resource from Aragorn and Gandalf), which surged to Glade of Cleansing. I committed 12 willpower against 0 threat so added 12 progress to stage 2B.

 

I travelled to Glade of Cleansing.

 

I ended the turn by refreshing my cards and raising my threat to 35.

 

Turn Five began with each hero gaining a resource before I drew Rivendell Blade, making Galadriel's Handmaiden the top card of my deck.

 

I paid 1 from Gandalf and Glorfindel to play Galadriel's Handmaiden (lowering my threat to 34) and paid 1 from Aragorn to play Rivndell Blade on Glorfindel from the top of the deck, making Westfold Horse-Breeder the top card.

 

I committed Arwen (for 2, adding +1 defence to Gandalf), Galadriel's Handmaiden (for 2), Gandalf (for 3, refreshing with Shadowfax), Glorfindel (for 3, without exhausting), Silvan Refugee (for 2) and Westfold Horse-Breeder (for 1) before I drew Druadan Thief, who surged to Glade of Cleansing. I committed 13 willpower against 3 threat so added 5 progress to the active Galade of Cleansing, exploring it before I added 5 progress to stage 2B, exploring it and moving to stage 3, which added Dru-Buri-Dru to the staging area.

 

I travelled to Glade of Cleansing.

I engaged Dru-Buri-Dru and Druadan Thief.

 

I added 2 archery damage to Glorfindel before the Druadan Thief attacked Dunedain Hunter, drawing Leaves On Tree for no effect and inflicting 1 damage. Dru-Buri-Dru attacked Gandalf, drawing Stars In Sky for no effect and (after I exhausted a Honour Guard) inflicting no damage before Aragorn and Glorfindel attacked Dru-Buri-Dru, adding 5 progress on Dru-Buri-Dru.

 

I ended the turn by refreshing my cards and raising my threat to 35.

 

Turn Six began with each hero gaining a resource before I drew Westfold Horse-Breeder, making Gandalf's Staff the top card of my deck.

 

I paid 1 from Aragorn to play Quick Strike, exhausting Aragorn to attack Dru-Buri-Dru, inflicting 1 progress and adding him to the victory dispay and adding 6 progress to stage 3B.

 

I paid 1 from Gandalf and Glorfindel to play Gandalf's Staff on Gandalf from the top of my deck, making Rohan Warhorse the top card of the deck, then exhausted Gandalf's Staff to add 1 resource to Glorfindel and paid the resource to play Westfold Horse-Breeder, whose ability added the Rohan Warhorse to hand and shuffled my deck making Bilbo Baggins the top card of my deck.

 

I opted to throw caution to the wind and commit Arwen Undomiel (for 2, adding +1 defence to Gandalf), Dunedain Hunter (for 2), Galadriel's Handmaiden (for 2), Gandalf (for 5, refreshing with Shadowfax), Glorfindel (for 2, without exhausting), Honour Guard (for 1), Silvan Refugee (for 1) and Westfold Horse-Breeder (for 1) before I drew Lost Companion and removed the Silvan Refrugee from the quest. I committed 15 willpower against 0 threat so added 5 progress to Glade of Cleansing, exploring it and adding 10 progress to stage 3B, exploring it and winning the quest.

 

I had forgotten how good this deck is.

 

My final score was:

Completed Turns (5): 50.

Total Threat: 35.

Total Wounds On Heroes: 5.

Total VP: 0.

Total Score: 90.

FOG ON THE BARROW DOWNS (Four Player)

Using the same decks as the games from last Sunday, namely Merry, Pippin and Sam Gamgee (all from Black Riders), Aragorn (Lore) and the new versions of Gimli and Legolas and Boromir (Leadership), new Prince Imrahil and Beregond as well as my heroes, Arwen, Elladan and Elrohir.

 

This took two attempts due to (thanks to a bad error) Gimli dying  while stuck in a Great Barrow, attempt two worked much better and the whole Fellowship made it through the game.

 

KNIFE IN THE DARK (Four Player)

Continuing on with a slight change to her hero line up (namely replacing the Lore Aragorn with the Tactics version), which proved to be handy with Bill Ferny. After a somewhat harrowing run the Fellowship completed the quest and Elladan gained the Valient Warrior boon.

Forging The Fellowship: Intruders In Chetwood.

 

Since I know I'm going to do another saga run through eventually I decided to rebuild a old favourite deck of mine.

 

My heroes were Elrond, Gandalf and Glorfindel (Spirit), with 32 threat and a opening hand containing Arwen Undomiel, Asfaloth x2, Flame of Arnor, Galadriel's Handmaiden and Shadowfax with Light of Valinor as the top card of the deck.

 

Quest setup consisted of putting Iarion into play under my control and adding Orc War Party and Shrouded Hills to the staging area.

 

Turn One began with each of my heroes gaining a resource before I drew Light of Valinor (making Galadriel's Handmaiden the top card of my deck).

 

I paid 1 from Glorfindel to play Light of Valinor on himself and paid 1 from Elrond and Gandalf to play Galadriel's Handmaiden, lowering my threat to 31 and making A Test Of Will the top card of my deck.

 

I committed Elrond, Galadriel's Handmaiden, Glorfindel (without exhausting) and Iarion before I revealed Angmar Marauder. I committed 9 willpower against 7 threat so added 2 progress to stage 1B.

 

I travelled to Shrouded Hills.

 

I opted to engage the Angmar Marauder.

 

The Angmar Marauder attacked Gandalf, drawing Sudden Assault for no effect and doing no damage before Glorfindel attacked the Angmar Marauder, doing 1 damage.

 

I ended the turn by refreshing my cards before raising my threat to 33.

 

Turn Two began with each hero gaining a resource before I drew A Test of Will, making Elrond's Counsel the top card of my deck.

 

I paid 1 from Elrond, Gandalf and Glorfindel to play Shadowfax on Gandalf.

 

I committed Elrond, Galadriel's Handmaiden, Gandalf (refreshing with Shadowfax), Glorfindel (without exhausting) and Iarion before playing Elrond's Counsel to add 1 willpower to Gandalf and lower my threat to 30, making Northern Tracker the top card of my deck. I revealed Surprising Speed and returned the Angmar Marauder to the staging area. I committed 12 willpower against 6 threat so added 5 progress to Shrouded Hills, exploring it, and 1 progress to stage 1B.

 

Once again I engaged Angmar Marauder.

 

The Angmar Marauder attacked Gandalf, drawing Sudden Assault for no effect and doing no damage before Glorfindel attacked the Angmar Marauder doing another damage.

 

I ended the turn by refreshing my cards and raising my threat to 32.

 

Turn Three began with each hero gaining a resource before I drew Northern Tracker, making Bilbo Baggins the top card of my deck.

 

I paid 1 from Elrond and Gandalf to play Bilbo Baggins, who pulled Wizard Pipe into hand and made Shadowfax the top card of the deck before I paid 1 from Glorfindel to play Wizard Pipe on Gandalf.

 

I committed Bilbo Baggins, Elrond, Galadriel's Handmaiden, Gandalf (refreshing with Shadowfax), Glorfindel (without exhausting) and Iarion. I revealed Rugged Country. I committed 14 willpower against 5 threat so added 9 progress to stage 1B.

 

I travelled to Rugged Country.

 

The Angmar Marauder attacked Gandalf, drawing Outlying Homestead for no effect and doing no damage before Glorfindel hit back, inflicting 1 more damage on the Angmar Marauder.

 

I ended the turn by refreshing everything and raising my threat to 34.

 

Turn Four began with each hero gaining a resource before I drew Shadowfax, making Unexpected Courage the top card of my deck.

 

I paid 1 from Elrond and Gandalf to play Vilya on Elrond, then exhausted Elrond and Vilya to play Unexpected Courage from the top of my deck onto Elrond (making Narya the top card of my deck) and exhausted Unexpected Courage to refresh Elrond.

 

I committed Bilbo Baggins, Elrond, Galadriel's Handmaiden, Gandalf (refreshing with Shadowfax), Glorfindel (without exhausting) and Iarion, then revealed Outlying Homestead, which raised my threat to 35. I committed 14 willpower against 5 threat so added 3 progress to Rugged Country, exploring it and 6 progress to stage 1B.

 

I risked travelling to Outlying Homestead, revealing Borders of Bree-Land and adding it to the staging area.

 

The Angmar Marauder attacked Gandalf, drawing Angmar Captain and doing no damage before Glorfindel finally killed the Angmar Marauder.

 

I ended the turn by refreshing my cards and raising my threat to 37.

 

I started Turn Five by adding a resource to each of my heroes before I drew Narya, making Miner of the Iron Hills the top card of my deck.

 

I exhausted Wizard Pipe to move Asfaloth to the top of my deck and move Miner of the Iron Hills to my hand, then paid 1 from Gandalf and 1 from Elrond to play Asfaloth on Glorfindel, paid 2 from Glorfindel to play Arwen Undomiel and exhausted Elrond and Vilya to play Warden of Healing from the top of my deck, making Miner of the Iron Hills the top card of my deck, and exhausted Unexpected Courage to refresh Elrond.

 

I exhausted Asfaloth to add 2 progress to Outlying Homestead.

 

I committed Arwen Undomiel (adding +1 defence to Gandalf), Bilbo Baggins, Elrond, Galadriel's Handmaiden, Gandalf (refreshing with Shadowfax), Glorfindel (without exhausting) and Iarion before I revealed Rescue Iarion (putting Iarion under it and 4 time counters on it).

 

I committed 15 willpower against 5 threat so added 6 progress to Outlying Homestead, exploring it and added 4 progress to stage 1B.

 

I travelled to Borders of Bree-Land.

 

I ended the turn by refreshing my cards and raising my threat to 39 before removing a Time counter from Rescue Iarion.

 

Turn Six kicked off with each of my heroes gaining a resource before I drew Miner of the Iron Hills, making Ethir Swordsman the top card of my deck.

 

I paid 1 from Elrond and Gandalf to play Ethir Swordsman (making Arwen Undomiel the top card of my deck), then paid 2 from Glorfindel to play Galadriel's Handmaiden, lowering my threat to 38 before I exhausted Wizard Pipe to put Northern Ranger onto the top of my deck and put Arwen Undomiel into my hand and exhausted Elrond and Vilya to play Northern Tracker from the top of my deck (making the other Northern Tracker the top card of my deck) before exhausting Unexpected Courage to refresh Elrond.

 

I exhausted Asfaloth to add 2 progress to Border of Bree-Land and opted to attempt Rescue Iarion before committing Arwen Undomiel (adding +1 defence to Elrond), Bilbo Baggins, Ethir Swordsman, Galadriel's Handmaiden x2, Northern Tracker and Warden of Healing and revealing another Borders of Bree-Land. I committed 12 willpower against 5 threat so added 2 progress to Borders of Bree-Land, exploring it, and 5 progress to Rescue Iarion.

 

I travelled to Borders of Bree-Land.

 

I opted to take the plunge and engage the Orc War Party.

 

The Orc War Party attacked Gandalf, drawing another Orc War Party for no effect and doing 2 damage before I paid 1 from Glorfindel to play Flame of Arnor and discard the Northern Tracker from the top of my deck, making Light of Valinor the top card, to refresh Gandalf and give him +4 attack before Elrond, Gandalf and Glorfindel attacked and killed the Orc War Party.

 

I ended the turn by refreshing everything and raising my threat to 39 before I removed another Time counter from Rescue Iarion.

 

Turn Seven began with each hero gaining a resource before I drew Light of Valinor, making Narya the top card of my deck.

 

I paid 1 from Elrond and Gandalf to play Narya on Gandalf.

 

I exhausted Asfaloth to add 2 progress to Borders of Bree-Land, then committed every character I could in a last ditch attempt to win the quest, then drew Angmar Captain. I committed 21 willpower against 3 threat so added 2 progress to Borders of Bree-Land and 16 progress to stage 1B, completing it and winning the quest.

 

The deck is strong as is but I think I may have to make some changes as I proceeed.

 

My final score was:

 

Completed turns (6): 60.

Total Threat: 39.

Wounds on heroes: 2.

Total VP: 1.

Final Score: 100.

THE SECRET DEFENDERS: INTRUDERS IN CHETWOOD.

 

I opted to go back to the decks from this article: https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2015/3/12/the-secret-defenders/ [https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2015/3/12/the-secret-defenders/] . After a slow start (losing by 4 on round 1 I was on the verge of quitting) the decks came together quickly (getting 2 Northern Trackers into play by turn 4 was handy) I managed to complete the quest just in time to not threat out. My plan is to alter the decks as I go (priority being to find a replacement for Frodo since the plan is to go as far as the saga  quests).

THE SECRET DEFENDERS: THE WEATHERED HILLS

 

Continuing with minimal changes to the decks (putting 3 copies of Armoured Destrier into the Aragorn/Halbarad/Sam deck was a top choice since it let Halbarad defend against the inevitable Cornered Orcs) and winning after a slog.

THE GRAND CAMPAIGN: PERIL IN PELARGIR

 

After Massing At Osgiliath I changed the decks to a more Grey Company-related line-up

 

Deck #1's heroes were Beravor, Damrod and Idraen, with 30 threat and a opening hand containing Entangling Nets, Ithilien Pit, Poisoned Stakes, Ranger Bow, Song of Wisdom and The Galadhrim's Greeting.

 

Deck #2's heroes were Aragorn (Tactics) Beregond (Tactics) and Halbarad, with 32 threat and a opening hand (after a mulligan) containing Armoured Destrier, Faramir, Steward of Gondor, Sword That Was Broken, The Red Arrow and Wealth of Gondor.

 

Setup for the quest consisted of making The Leaping Fish the active location, attaching Alcaron's Scroll to Elrohir and adding 2 copies of Harbour Thug to the staging area before making deck #1 the first player.

 

Round One began with adding a resource to each hero before deck #1 drew Forest Patrol and deck #2 drew Dagger of Westernesse.

 

Deck #1 played Entangling Net into the staging area and paid 1 from Beravor and Damrod to play Poisoned Stakes into the staging area.

 

Deck #2 paid 1 from Aragorn to play Dagger of Westernesse on himself and played Wealth of Gondor to add 1 resource to Damrod.

 

I started the quest phase by discarding Harbour Storehouse and discarded Collateral Damage.

 

I committed Beravor (for 2), Damrod (for 2) and Idraen (for 3).

 

Draw #1 was Collateral Damage (I discarded City Streets, Market Square, Local Trouble and Pickpocket and increased deck #1's threat to 34 and deck #2 to 36. Both Harbour Thugs engaged deck #2).

 

Draw #2 was Harbour Storehouse.

 

I committed 7 attack against 1 threat so added 6 progress to The Leaping Fish, exploring it and sending it to the victory display as well as refreshing Idraen.

 

I travelled to Harbour Storehouse.

 

I added a shadow card to each engaged enemy.

 

The first Harbour Thug attacked Beregond. The shadow card was Pelargir Docks for no effect so the attack did no damage.

 

The second Harbour Thug attacked Halbarad. The shadow card was Lossarnach Bandt for no effect so the attack did 1 damage.

 

Aragorn attacked the first Harbour Thug, killing it.

 

I ended the round by refreshing everything, increased deck #1's threat to 35 and deck #2's to 37 and made deck #2 first player.

 

Round Two began with each hero gaining a resource before deck #2 drew Honour Guard and deck #1 drew Forest Patrol.

I committed 9 attack vs 4 threat so added 4 progress to Harbour Storehouse, exploring it and refreshing Idraen, and added 1 progress to stage 1B.

 

Deck #2 engaged Harbour Thug and deck #1 engaged Zealous Traitor.

 

I added a shadow card to each engaged enemy.

 

The Zealous Traitor attacked Idraen. The shadow card was Local Trouble, for no effect so (after deck #2 exhausted Honour Guard) the attack did no damage.

 

The first Honour Guard attacked Beregon. The shadow card was Pickpocket, so deck #2 discarded Dagger of Westernesse before the attack did no damage.

 

Deck #2 exhausted Armoured Destrier to refresh Beregond and discard the shadow card on the other Harbour Thug.

 

The second Harbour Thug (with Ithilien Pit attached) attacked Beregond, doing no damage.

THE GRAND CAMPAIGN: ENCOUNTER AT AMON DIN

 

Since I've recently played half of this cycle I decided to skip to quests which I haven't done recently (the six times I failed to get past stage 1 of Into Ithilien are entirely unconnected).

 

In order to save time I will only mention the shadow card if it has a effect.

I ended the round by refreshing my cards, moving a villager from one Burning Homstead to Dead Villagers (and exhausting Lord Alcaron to prevent another), increasing deck #1's threat to 32 and deck #2's to 34 and making deck #1 first player.

THE GRAND CAMPAIGN: THE MORGUL VALE

 

This quest was a bloodbath. After 8 tries I finally ground out a win with the same decks as the above game.

 

By the end Aragorn, Boromir and Halbarad managed to finally kill the Nazgul of Minas Morgul with deck #2 on 49 threat. Unfortunately I had quit the game and deleted my writeup before I rememebered that deck #1 had a Desperate Alliance in hand so I moved Aragorn over to deck #2 to provide the needed attack strength to kill the Nazgul.

For this saga run through I decided to go with as many members of the canon Fellowship as possible.

After deck #2 increased their threat to 31 to refresh Boromir, he defended against the Evil Crow (shadow card: Black Rider for no effect), doing no damage before deck #2 increased their threat to 32 to refresh Boromir again. As a aside, Boromir is certainly showing his quality.

Deck #2 exhausted Merry for 2 willpower and drew Green Hill Country and Ride Like The Wind so both decks passed their hide tests).

 

Deck #1 drew Crawling Towards Him (exhausting Pippin for 3 willpower and drawing Green Hill Country and Piercing Cry for 2 threat so passing the hide test).

 

I committed 27 willpower against 11 threat so added 1 progress to Pathless Country, exploring it.

 

The Fellowship travelled to another Pathless Country (with 1 progress).

 

Deck #2 was forced to engage the Black Rider.

 

After adding a shadow card the Black Rider attacked Boromir (shadow card: Have You Seen Baggins, for no effect), doing no damage.

 

After increasing deck #2's threat to 39 to refresh Boromir, he, Gildor and Legolas attacked and killed the Black Rider, adding 2 progress to the active Pathless Country, exploring it.

 

At the end of the round I refreshed my cards, increased deck #1's threat to 34 and deck #2's to 40, paid 1 from Frodo and made deck #1 first player.

 

Round Seven began with each hero gaining a resource before deck #1 drew Miner of the Iron Hills and deck #2 drew Dagger of Westernesse.

Deck #1 drew Have You Seen Baggins, which was added to Pippin, which surged to Crawling Towards Him (deck #1 exhausted Aragorn, Ranger of the North and Pippin for 9 willpower and I drew 2 copies of Stock Road for 6 threat so the hide test was passed).

 

Deck #2 drew Lure Of The Ring. Deck

#1 increased their threat to 37 before it surged to Crawling Towards Him (deck #2 exhausted Boromir, Legolas and Merry for 4 willpower before I drew The Marish and Lure Of The Ring for 3 threat so the Hide test was passed).

 

I committed 27 willpower against 5 threat so would have made a bucket load of progress if the stage would have let me.

Deck #1 exhausted Merry and Ethir Swordsman for 4 and discarded Green Hill Country for 4 so passed the Hide test).

 

Deck #1 drew Have You Seen Baggins and attached it to Pippin (again) before it surged to The Ring Draws Them, which surged to Evil Crow.

 

I committed 26 willpower against 5 threat so explored Pathless Country.

 

Thanks to The Ring Draws Them the Evil Crow attacked Boromir (shadow card: Crawling Towards Him for no effect), doing no damage.

 

The Fellowship exhausted Merry for 2 willpower and drew Evil Crow, Ride Like The Wind and Hunting for the Ring, so passed the hide test and moved to Buckleberry Ferry.

I committed 28 willpower against 5 threat, making 23 progress, exploring Buckleberry Ferry and winning the game.

THE SAGA CAMPAIGN: THE OLD FOREST

 

For this quest I retained the boon Mr. Underhill and the burden The Ring Draws Them.

In order to set up the quest I added Deep Gulley and Misleading Path to the staging area, deck #1 drew Errand-Rider and deck #2 drew Defender of Rammas, moving onto a random stage 2B “Choked With Brambles”, attached Old Bogey-Stories to Pippin and made deck #1 first player.

The second Grasping Root attacked Boromir (shadow card: Long Trailer for no effect), doing no damage before I ended the round by refreshing everything, increasing deck #1's threat to 34 and deck #2's to 35 and making deck #2 first player.

Deck #1 drew Falling Branches, which deck #2 paid 1 from Frodo and exhausted The One Ring to shuffle back into the encounter deck before drawing Strange Woods, which was added to the staging area.

 

I committed 22 willpower against 19 threat so added 3 progress to a Wall of Trees in the staging area.

 

At this point in the game I guessed that the odds of winning the quest were low to non-existent so decided to call it quits.

THE GRAND CAMPAIGN: THE FORDS OF ISEN (FIVE ATTEMPTS)

 

This quest was a real mess. Four attempts with 3 different decks met with no success until I switched to a deck containing Eowyn (Spirit, for card discarding), Gandalf (for questing and defending in a pinch) and Haldir (questing and sniping enemies in the staging area) and a deck containing Tactics Aragorn (for fighting), Tactics Beregond (for defending) and Leadership Faramir (for questing, ally readying and fighting). This combo finally ground out a win but after 4 tries I really couldn't build up the impetus to write up another failed attempt.

 

With any luck the next quest might be less of a pain in the rear.

Playing catch up thanks to some internet issues.

 

THE GRAND CAMPAIGN: TROUBLE IN THARBAD

Switching to a pair of decks featuring Elrond, Gandalf and spirit Glorfindel on one deck and Aragorn (Tactics), Gimli (Leadershio) and Legolas (Spirit) allowed me to get through this in two attempts.

 

THE GRAND CAMPAIGN: THE NIN-IN-ELPH

Completed in three attempts with the same decks as above (although I lost Elrond and Gimli on the successful attempt).

 

THE GRAND CAMPAIGN: CELEBRIMBOR'S SECRET

I managed to complete the quest in one go (due, I suspect, to getting some good encounter deck draws).

 

THE GRAND CAMPAIGN: THE ANTLERED CROWN

My string of good luck continued (getting two copies of Protector of Lorien into play on round one allowed me to keep my hands suitably svelte and sylph like to avoid the worst effects from the Dunlandings).

Draw #3 was Outlying Homestead (which increased both decks threat to 41.

 

Draw #4 was Pressing Needs, which increased both decks threat to 43 and forced me to switch my current quest to Lost In The Wilderness.

 

Draw #5 was Angmar Marauder.

 

Draw #6 was Shrouded Hills.

 

I committed 17 willpower against 22 threat so increased both decks threat to 48. Since the odds of my pulling off a win were little to none I opted to call it since I was so far behind the curve. For the next game I'm making some changes.

I managed the 200 games challenge a couple of years ago but kept writing up my games since there was a audience of sorts for the idea. I don't want to think how many games I've played since I started this thread.

THE GRAND CAMPAIGN: DEADMANS DYKE (ATTEMPT #7)

 

Attempts 1 through 6 went really wrong (attempt 6 took long enough for me to figure out that hero Arwen is not ideal for a quest where running out of cards is a bad idea) quickly so I changed to a new pair of decks.

 

Deck #1 was Aragorn (Lore), Glorfindel (Spirit) and Lanwyn, with 26 threat and a opening hand (after a mulligan) containing A Test of Will, Ethir Swordsman, Northern Tracker, Self-Preservation x2 and Warden of Healing.

In order to setup the quest I made deck #1 first player, put Iarion into play, added Fornost Square to the staging area, put a Baleful Shade into play engaged with each deck, shuffled the encounter deck, drew Seal The Tomb (buffing Iarion), which was added to the staging area and surged to Norbury Tombs, which was added to the staging area before I drew Dark Sorcery, which increased deck #1's threat to 28 and deck #2's to 32.

THE GRAND CAMPAIGN: WASTES OF ERIADOR

 

Thanks to forgetting to copy the write-up for this I will have to just do a short write-up. I played solo using Elrond, Gandalf and Glorfindel (Spirit) and the quest was a massive slog. It took 10 rounds and I lost Elrond on the last turn before I killed the Pack Leader.

THE GRAND CAMPAIGN: ESCAPE FROM MOUNT GRAM

 

This was a major slog playing it solo. I managed to scrape a win with the Elrond Gandalf Spirit Glorfindel deck but I'm starting to think that going back to two-handed is a good idea.

THE GRAND CAMPAIGN; THE TREACHERY OF RHUDAUR (ATTEMPT #2-4)

 

After another 3 attempts with essentially the same decks I finally managed to eke out a win (but only after losing Gandalf, Elrond and Legolas and using half of the questing allies as meat shields in order to pull off a win. I'm really not looking forward to seeing how bad the last two quests are going to be.

I've tried Battte of Carn Dum twice and it's been a massive pain in the bottom.

After playing 14 or 15 games of Battle of Carn Dum with a wide variety of decks and not getting past stage 1 I've decided to skip the quest (because I'm getting to the point where I'm starting to feel like I'm getting sick of the whole game (it might be trauma from figuratively banging my head up against a wall trying to beat the quest) I'm going to skip Battle of Carn Dum and proceed to The Dread Ream.

 

I mean, it can't be as bad as BoCA.

Carn Dum is the last quest to date that made me feel like that. There are a few other head-bangers (mostly Print on Demand quests, honestly) but they're either more reasonable or more fun on the whole, making it easier to keep going.

THE GRAND (SAGA) CAMPAIGN: A SHADOW OF THE PAST

 

This was going to be a proper write-up but (due to not drawing certain cards to deal with the sheer amount of locations) took 17 turns to grind out a win. 

 

I decided to go for a two-player campaign attempt. Deck #1 contained Elrond, Haldir and Sam Gamgee and deck #2 contained Aragorn (Tactics), Beregond (Tactics) and Eowyn.

 

In the end I opted to add Gandalf's Delay and Mr. Underhill to the campaign log.

THE GRAND (SAGA) CAMPAIGN: A SHADOW OF THE PAST

 

Another quest which lasted so long (14 turns) that I gave up on writing it up. In the end my heroes escaped and managed to do enough damage to gain Old Bogey Stories.

THE GRAND (SAGA) CAMPAIGN: FOG ON THE BARROW-DOWNS

 

Again, due to lack of time I didn't have time to write up the full report but, after a scare where Beregond was left with 1 hit point remaining with a final attack to fend off, the Fellowship got off the Barrow-Downs and claimed the Ho! Tom Bombadil! boon.

 

Hopefully I should have more time from now on to get some proper write-ups done.

THE GRAND (SAGA) CAMPAIGN: A KNIFE IN THE DARK

 

The Fellowship just managed to make it through the quest (after a few hairy moments at Weathertop where I had drawn no healing from the Elrond/Haldir/Sam dack). Regardless, I managed to finish the quest (albeit with a pile of dead allies who were thrown in the way of angry Nazgul to keep the heroes intact). 

 

In the end Sam Gamgee gained the Valiant Warrior boon (after getting a surprising amount of use refreshing and attacking enemies) and Beregond gained the Tireless Ranger boon (making him a complete monster defence-wise).

THE GRAND (SAGA) CAMPAIGN: FLIGHT TO THE FORD

 

The Fellowship again barely made it through the quest, with Beregond on 1 wound when I managed to explore Ford of Bruinen. Due to bad luck I wound up having to add the Burdens Eaten Alive!, Fear of Discovery and Panicked to the campaign log. With the second half of FotR I should have the time to actually write up the games.

GRAND CAMPAIGN REDUX – PERIL IN PELARGIR

 

I decided to give the campaign idea another go. These runs will be solo and I will probably change the hero line up as I go for specific quests.

 

My heroes were Aragorn (Lore), Frodo Baggins and Glorfindel (Spirit), with 24 threat and a opening hand (after a mulligan) containing Ethir Swordsman, Hasty Stroke, Miner of the Iron Hills, Sam Gamgee, Song of Travel and The Galadhrim's Greeting.

 

Set up for the quest comprised making The Leaping Fish the active location, attaching Alcaron's Scroll to Frodo and adding a Harbour Thug to the staging area before I shuffled the encounter deck.

 

Turn One began with adding a resource to each of my heroes before I drew Warden of Healing.

 

In the planning phase I paid 1 from Frodo and Glorfindel to play Ethir Swordsman.

 

In the quest phase I discarded Collateral Damage, then committed Ethir Swordsman.

 

I drew another Collateral Damage and discarded City Streets (increasing my threat to 26 and forcing me to engage the Harbour Thug), Harbour Thug, Harbour Storehouse (increasing my threat to 28) and Umbar Assassin.

 

I committed 1 attack vs 0 threat so added 1 progress to The Leaping Fish.

 

In the combat phase I added a shadow card before the Harbour Thug attacked Frodo (shadow card: Harbour Thug, for no effect), increasing my threat to 29 before Aragorn and Glorfindel killed the Harbour Thug.

 

At the end of the round I refreshed my cards and increased my threat to 30.

 

Round Two began with adding resources before I drew Miner of the Iron Hills.

 

In the planning phase I paid 1 from Glorfindel to play Sam Gamgee and paid 2 from Aragorn to play Warden of Healing.

 

In the quest phase I drew and discarded Pelargir Docks before committing Ethir Swordsman, Frodo Baggins and Sam Gamgee.

 

I drew Pickpocket, adding it to the staging area.

 

I committed 3 attack vs 3 threat so made no progress.

 

I was forced to engage the Pickpocket.

 

After adding a shadow card the Pickpocket made a undefended attack on Frodo (removing a resource from Frodo and discarding Song of Travel). The shadow card was Harbour Thug, for no real effect so the attack raised my threat to 31 before Aragorn and Glorfindel killed the Pickpocket.

 

At the end of the round I refreshed my cards and increased my threat to 32.

 

Round Three began with adding resources before I drew Light of Valinor.

 

I paid 1 from Gllorfindel to play Light of Valinor on himself.

 

In the quest phase I discarded City Streets, then committed Ethir Swordsman, Frodo Baggins, Glorfindel (without exhausting) and Sam Gamgee.

 

I drew Local Trouble and attached it to Aragorn.

 

I committed 6 attack vs 0 threat so added 5 progress to The Leaping Fish, exploring it (total VP: 3), and added 1 progress to stage 1B.

 

At the end of the round I refreshed everything and increased my threat to 33.

 

Round Four began with adding resources before I drew Warden of Healing.

 

In the planning phase I paid 2 from Aragorn to play Miner of the Iron Hills (discarding the Local Trouble on Aragorn).

 

In the quest phase I committed Aragorn, Ethir Swordsman, Glorfindel (without exhausting), Miner of the Iron Hills and Sam Gamgee.

 

I drew City Streets, which was added to the staging area and surged to another Collateral Damage. I discarded Pickpocket, Harbour Thug, Zealous Traitor, Lost In The City, Local Trouble and Market Square (increasing my threat to 35).

 

I committed 9 attack against 2 threat so added 5 progress to stage 1B, exploring it. Stage 2 moved Alcaron's Scroll to the staging area.

 

I was forced to move to the City Streets.

 

At the end of the round I refreshed my cards before increasing my threat to 36.

 

Round Five began with adding resources before I drew Wingfoot.

 

In the planning phase I paid 1 from Aragorn to play Wingfoot on himself.

 

In the quest phase I committed Aragorn (naming Enemy for Wingfoot), Ethir Swordsman, Frodo, Glorfindel (without exhausting), Miner of the Iron Hills and Sam Gamgee.

 

I drew Pelargir Docks, adding it to the staging area.

 

I committed 10 attack vs 4 threat so added 2 progress to City Streets, exploring it, and added 4 progress to stage 2B.

 

I opted to risk travelling to Pelargir Docks.

 

At the end of the round I refreshed my cards and increased my threat to 37 before risking triggering Aragorn's ability to lower my threat to 24.

 

Round Six began with adding resources before I drew Henamarth Riversong.

 

I paid 1 from Aragorn to play Henamarth Riversong, then exhausted him to look at the top card of the encounter deck, then return it.

 

I committed Aragorn (naming Treachery for Wingfoot), Ethir Swordsman, Glorfindel (without exhausting), Miner of the Iron Hills and Sam, then drew Collateral Damage (refreshing Aragorn and discarding Lurking In Shadows, Lossarnach Bandit, Zealous Traitor, another Zealous Traitor, another Lossarnach Bandit, Lurking In Shadows, Market Square (increasing my threat to 26) and Pickpocket) so I committed 9 attack vs 0 threat so added 3 progress to Pelargir Docks (exploring it) and added 6 progress to stage 2B before exhausting Frodo to attach Alcaron's Scroll to him.

 

I ended the round by refreshing my cards and increasing my threat to 27.

 

Round Seven began with adding resources before I drew Northern Tracker.

 

I paid 2 each from Frodo and Glorfindel to play Northern Tracker, then exhausted Henamarth to look at the top card of the encounter deck, then return it.

 

I committed Ethir Swordsman, Miner of the Iron Hills and Northern Tracker, then drew Harbour Storehouse (which was added to the staging area). I committed 4 attack vs 1 threat so added 3 progress to stage 2B, exploring it. Stage 3 forced me to shuffle the encounter discard pile into a new encounter deck, pull a Harbour Thug into the staging area and shuffle the encounter deck again.

 

I opted not to travel.

 

I engaged the Harbour Thug.

 

After adding a shadow card the Harbour Thug attacked Frodo (shadow card: Pelargir Docks, for no effect) increasing my threat to 28 before Aragorn and Glorfindel killed the Harbour Thug.

 

At the end of the round I refreshed my cards and increased my threat to 29.

 

Round Nine began with each hero gaining a resource before I drew Gandalf (Core).

 

I paid 1 from Aragorn and Glorfindel and 3 from Frodo to play Gandalf, who reduced my threat to 24.

 

I committed Aragorn (naming Enemy for Wingfoot), Ethir Swordsman, Frodo Baggins, Gandalf, Glorfindel (without exhausting), Henamarth Riversong, Northern Tracker (adding 1 progress to the Harbour Storehouse), Sam Gamgee and Warden of Healing, then drew Local Trouble, attaching it to Aragorn. I committed 17 willpower against 1 threat so added 16 progress to stage 3B, exploring it and winning the quest.

 

This was a slog. Granted, this deck can suffer in Battle Quests but it went pretty well.

 

In the end my score was:

 

Completed Rounds (7): 70

Total Threat: 24.

Total VP: 3.

Final Score: 91.

Huh? All you have to do is click “log play” on BGG. It doesn’t take more than a minute. Unless you mean actually recording gameplay, but I don’t do that. And I respect @silverthorn [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/211978-silverthorn/] for having the patience to do so.:) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I think I thought you and gelatinous cube from the warriors of the west blog were the same person but that is clearly some faulty association I made in my brain!

Oh, haha! Yeah he does some impressive stuff. Do you mean @PsychoRocka [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/223754-psychorocka/], though (although "gelatinous cube" is a killer for sure. I think the reason you confused us is the profile thumbnail. Elrohir and Haldir look similar.

One observation and one question: on round 2, you play Galadriel, looking at your top 5 cards and putting Sword that was Broken into play. But then you shuffled the deck instead of putting the remaining cards on top in any order.

Also on round 2, how do you keep getting Elrond's Counsel back into your hand? If you're playing it for its effect, silver harp shouldn't bring it back, but if you're discarding it to Arwen and bringing it back, you shouldn't get it's effect.

Anyways - those are minor issues, and I enjoy reading your writeups. Keep up the good work!

I think there were a lot of mistakes in the last couple of quests (it's been a while since I've played and I'm pondering going back to solo play so that I can better keep track of what's going on).

The Grand Campaign - The Morgul Vale

 

After five failed attempts with variations on my Elrond/Gandalf/Sporfindel deck I was going to go back to two-handed play when I squeeked out a win on attempt six. Granted Elrond was killed by the Nazgul two turns before the end and I was chucking large numbers of questing allies under the Nazgulbus to keep Gandalf and Glorfindel alive but I finally managed to pull off a win on 48 threat.

 

I'm considering going with two decks for the next set of quests in order to make things less ridiculous.

Grand Campaign Redux - The Three Trials

 

After 8 attempts with a variety of solo and two-handed deck combos I finally managed to slog out a win with one deck containing Aragorn (Tactics), Arwen Undomiel and Grimbeorn the Old and another containing Elrond, Erkenbrand and Sam Gamgee. The two decks seemed to work well together and I'll keep playing with this combo for now.

Whilst sorting the encounter cards out after finishing the quest I noticed I'd failed to notice the fact that Jailer Gornakh had an ability which would have messed up my game to no end. After the slog that was EFMG I'm not going to give it another go since I accidentally made The Wastes of Eriador more complicated by not counting the stage 1 Willpower bonus on more than one occasion.

GRAND CAMPAIGN – RAID ON THE GREY HAVENS.


 

Deck #1's heroes were Elrond, Haldir of Lorien and Sam Gamgee, with 30 threat and a opening hand after a mulligan containing A Burning Brand, Armoured Destrier, Orcrist, Rosie Cotton x2 and Steed of the North.


 

Deck #2's heroes were Aragorn (Tactics), Arwen Undomiel and Grimbeorn the Old, with 32 threat and a post-mulligan opening hand containing A Test Of Will, Bofur, Bow of Yew, Elven-Light, Feint and Soldier of Dol Amroth.


 

Set up for the quest comprised making deck #1 first player, preparing the Corsair deck, putting Dream-Chaser into play under deck #1's control, putting Narlenya into play under deck #2's control, preparing the Stormcaller's area (with the Stormcaller quest deck and and the Stormcaller there), adding Rolling Seas to my staging area and shuffling the encounter deck.


 

Round One began with each hero gaining a resource before deck #1 drew Wingfoot and deck #2 drew Beorn's Rage.


 

Deck #1 paid 1 from Elrond and Sam to play Rosie Cotton and paid 1 from Haldir to play Wingfoot on himself.


 

Deck #2 discarded Elven-Light to give Arwen a resource.


 

At the start of the Quest phase I moved the heading to 1 off-course, committed Dream-Chaser and drew and discarded Sudden Storms and Winds of Wrath, moving the heading back to on-course.


 

Deck #1 exhausted Rosie to buff Sam before I committed Arwen (for 3), Elrond (for 3), Haldir (for 2, naming Enemy) and Sam (for 5).


 

Draw #1 was Thrown Off-Course, which increased deck #1's threat to 34 and deck #2's to 36.


 

Draw #2 was Calm Waters, which was added to the staging area.


 

I committed 13 willpower vs 5 threat, so added 8 progress to stage 1B, exploring it. Stage 2 searched the encounter deck for a Swift Raider, added it to the staging area and shuffled the encounter deck.


 

The Fellowship travelled to Calm Waters.


 

Deck #2 engaged the Swift Raider, as well as 2 copies of Cunning Pirate I drew from the Corsair deck.


 

After adding shadow cards, the Swift Raider attacked Narlenya, doing no damage.


 

The first Cunning Pirate made a undefended attack on Narlenya, the shadow card was Man Overboard so Narlenya took 4 damage.


 

The second Cunning Pirate attacked Grimbeorn. Again, the shadow card was Man Overboard so Grimbeorn took 1 damage. Deck #2 paid 1 from Grimbeorn so he could attack the Cunning Pirate, doing 3 damage.


 

Aragorn attacked the other Cunning Pirate, doing 2 damage.


 

I ended the round by refreshing everything, increasing deck #1's threat to 35 and deck #2's to 37 before I discarded Raging Squall and added 2 progress to stage 2D before making deck #2 first player.


 

Round Two began with each hero gaining a resource before deck #2 drew Gandalf (Core) and deck #1 drew Bill The Pony.


 

Deck #2 paid 2 from Aragorn and 3 from Arwen to play Gandalf, doing 4 damage to the Cunning Pirate with 2 wounds, killing it.

I never thought of that (it probably would have made things easier).

After considering how infrequently Lanwyn's ability triggered I opted to retry A SHadow Of The Past, replacing her with (the somewhat more thematic) Galadriel. As the result was the same (no heroes lost or replaced and Mr. Underhill and Gandalf's Delay taken, I opted not to post the write-up.

Was invited to a four-player Saga campaign. I opted to use my Hobbit deck alongside decks with Aragorn/Legolas/Gimli, Gandalf/Boromir/Rossiel and Arwen/Elladan/Elrohir. The first two quests (Shadow and Old Forest) went well, no heroes died and we managed to nab Old Bogey-Stories. Again, Gaffer Gamgee was the MVP of my deck (letting me engage Black Rider before the Ranged heroes in the other decks helped kill them).

 

In order to avoid doing two saga campaigns at the same time I'm going to just keep folks here updated on the multi-player run through and go back to playing different quests as  more regular gaming.

Continued the four-player Saga runthrough from yesterday. Played Barrow Downs (which got tense when all the other players were stuck in Barrows at one point but we somehow squeeked through), Knife In The Dark (which seemed to go well. I'm not sure since I'm no good at judging how games are going in four-player yet. Merry got Valiant Warrior) and Flight To The Ford (which went interestingly, no-one died but we got a lot of burdens added to the campaign pool). All in all, the fellowship got to Rivendell and we'll probably start The Road Darkens next weekend.

Continued the saga campaign from last weeked, THe Ring Goes South and Journy In The Dark went well, the heroes ( Merry, Pippin and Sam as well as  Aragorn/Legolas/Gimli, Gandalf/Boromir/Rossiel and Arwen/Elladan/Elrohir) all survived and once again Gaffer was a massive help. Unfortunately, Breaking of the Fellowship went really, really badly. I pulled Fallen Into Evil on (somewhat unexpectedly) the last round and played it on Pippin. As it was, we drew no threat that round and just managed to win the quest so Pippin is now a (officially) dead hero.

Saga Campaign Scenario 2: A Knife In The Dark

 

Due to a file corrupting technical issue my full write up was unsalvagable but the highlights (of a sort) are that Merry fell in the last turn of the game, taking one for the team so that Boromir and Legolas could kill the Witch King and win the quest. In the end I gave Boromir the Tireless Ranger boon and Sam the Noble Hero boon. I'm going to go with theme over common sense and replace Merry with Spirit Glorfindel.

Solo Runthrough – Passage Through Mirkwood.

 

My heroes were Aragorn (Ta), Eowyn (Ta) and Beregond (Sp), with 28 threat and a opening hand containing Arwen Undomiel, Bow of Yew, Defender of Rammas, Golden Shield, Gondorian Shield and Unexpected Courage.

 

I set up the quest by searching the encounter deck for Forest Spider and Old Forest Road, adding them to the staging area and shuffling the encounter deck.

 

Round One began with adding resources before I drew Magic Ring.

 

I played Bow of Yew on Aragorn and paid 1 from Aragorn to play Gondorian Shield on Beregond.

 

I committed Aragorn and Eowyn, then drew Eyes of the Forest, which did nothing. I committed 6 vs 3 so added 3 progress to stage 1B.

 

I travelled to Old Forest Road, which refreshed Aragorn.

 

I was forced to engage the Forest Spider.

 

The Forest Spider attacked Beregond (SC: Moutains of Mirkwood, for no effect), doing no damage and lowering my threat to 27. I counter-attacked with Aragorn, killing the Forest Spider.

 

At the end of the round I refreshed my cards and increased my threat to 28.

 

Round Two began with adding resources before I drew Ring of Barahir.

 

I paid 2 from Eowyn to play Defender of Rammas and paid 2 from Beregond to play Arwen Undomiel.

 

I committed Eowyn and Arwen (buffing Beregond), then drew The Necromancer's Reach (inflicting 1 damage on Arwen and Eowyn). I committed 6 vs 0 so added 3 progress to Old Forest Road, exploring it, and added 3 progress to stage 1B.

 

At the end of the round I refreshed my cards and increased my threat to 29.

 

I started Round Three by adding resources and drawing Defender of Rammas.

 

I paid 2 from Aragorn to play another Defender of Rammas.

 

I committed Eowyn and Arwen (buffing Beregond), then drew King Spider, which exhausted a Defender of Rammas. I committed 6 vs 2 so added 4 progress to stage 1B, exploring it.

 

The King Spider attacked Beregond (SC: Forest Gate, for no effect), doing no damage and lowering my threat to 28. In response Aragorn killed the King Spider.

 

At the end of the round I refreshed my cards and increased my threat to 29.

 

I kicked off Round Four by adding resources before I drew Honour Guard.

 

I paid 2 from Beregond to play Unexpected Courage on himself and paid 2 from Eowyn to play Honour Guard.

 

I committed Arwen (buffing Beregond) and Eowyn, then drew Enchanted Stream, adding it to the staging area. I committed 6 vs 2 so added 4 progress to stage 2B, exploring it. The random stage 3B was “Don't Leave The Path” so I pulled Ungolient's Spawn out of the encounter deck, added it to the staging area and shuffled the encounter deck.

 

I opted to risk travelling to Enchanted Stream.

 

I engaged Ungolient's Spawn.

 

Ungolient's Spawn attacked Beregond (SC: Great Forest Web, for no effect), doing no damage and lowering my threat to 28 before I used Unexpected Courage to refresh Beregond. In response, Aragorn, Beregond and both Defenders of Rammas attacked Ungolient's Spawn, doing 5 damage.

 

At the end of the round I refreshed my cards and increased my threat to 29.

 

Round Five began with adding resources.

 

I committed Arwen (buffing Beregond) and Eowyn, then drew Hummerhorns, adding them to the staging area. I committed 6 vs 1 so added 2 progresss to Enchanted Stream, exploring it, and added 3 progress to stage 1B.

 

Ungolient's Spawn attacked Beregond (SC: Dol Goldur Orcs for +1 attack), doing no damage and decreasing my threat to 28 before I used Unexpected Courage to refresh Beregond so that Aragorn, Beregond and both Defenders of Rammas could attack and kill the Ungolient's Spawn, winning the game.

 

In the end my score was:

 

Completed Rounds (4): 40.

Final Threat: 28.

Wounds on Heroes: 1.

Final Score: 69.

Solo Run-through – Passage Through Mirkwood (Attempt Two).

 

My heroes were Aragorn (Lo), Frodo Baggins (Sp) and Glorfindel (Sp), with 24 threat and a opening hand (after a mulligan) containing A Test Of Will, Warden of Healing, Song of Wisdom, Light of Valinor, Woodmen's Clearing and Hasty Stroke.

 

I set up the quest by searching the encounter deck for Forest Spider and Old Forest Road, adding them to the staging area and shuffling the encounter deck.

 

Round One began with adding resources before I drew another Warden of Healing.

 

I paid 1 from Glorfindel to play Light of Valinor on himself, paid 1 from Frodo to play Song of Wisdom on himself and played Woodmen's Clearing on Old Forest Road.

I travelled to Old Forest Road, which refreshed Aragorn.

I paid 2 from Aragorn to play Warden of Healing.

 

I committed Aragorn (for 2) and Glorfindel (for 3, without exhausting), then drew Necromancer's Pass, which was added to the staging area. I committed 5 vs 4, so added 1 progress to Old Forest Road.

 

I opted to risk engaging the Hummerhorns, which increased my threat to 32.

 

The Hummerhorns attacked Frodo (shadow card: Caught In A Web, for no effect), doing no damage before Glorfindel killed the Hummerhorns.

 

At the end of the round I refreshed my cards, then increased my threat to 33.

 

Round Three began with adding resources before I drew another Woodsman's Clearing.

 

I paid 2 each from Frodo and Glorfindel to play Northern Tracker, then played Woodmen's Clearing on Necromancer's Pass.

 

I committed Aragorn (for 2), Glorfindel (for 3, without exhausting) and Northern Tracker (for 1, adding a progress to Necromancer's Pass), then drew Black Forest Bats, who removed the Northern Tracker from the quest. I committed 5 vs 4 so added 1 progress to Old Forest Road.

 

I engaged the Black Forest Bats.

 

The Black Forest Bats attacked Frodo (shadow card: Dol Goldur Beastmaster, for no effect), doing no damage before Glorfindel killed the Bats.

 

I ended the round by refreshing and increasing my threat to 34.

 

The fourth round began with adding resources before I drew another Light of Valinor.

 

I committed Aragorn (for 2), Glorfindel (for 3, without exhausting) and Northern Tracker (adding 1 progress to Necromancer's Pass, exploring it and lowering my threat to 31) before I drew Forest Gate, adding it to the staging area. I committed 6 vs 2 so added 1 progress to Old Forest Road (exploring it and lowering my threat to 28) and added 3 progress to stage 1B.

 

I opted to travel to Forest Gate, which allowed me to draw Elrond's Counsel and Asfaloth.

 

At the end of the round I refreshed, then increased my threat to 29.

 

Round five began with adding resources before I drew Hobbit Pony.

 

I paid 2 from Aragorn to play Asfaloth on Glorfindel, paid 1 from Aragorn and Frodo to play Warden of Healing and played Hobbit Pony on Frodo.

 

I exhausted Asfaloth to add 2 progress to Forest Gate, committed Aragorn (for 2), Glorfindel (for 3, without exhausting) and Northern Tracker (for 1), then drew Mountains Of Mirkwood, adding it to the staging area. I committed 6 vs 2 so added 2 progress to Forest Gate, exploring it, and added 2 progress to stage 1B.

 

I risked travelling to Mountains of Mirkwood, drawing another Mountains of Mirkwood and adding it to the staging area.

 

At the end of the round I refreshed and increased my threat to 30.

 

Round six began with adding resources before I drew another Elrond's Counsel.

 

I exhausted Asfaloth to add 2 progress to the active Mountains of Mirkwood, then committed Aragorn (for 2), Glorfindel (for 3, without exhausting) and Northern Tracker (for 1, adding 1 progress to Mountains of Mirkwood), then drew The Necromancer's Reach (inflicting 1 damage on Aragorn and the Northern Tracker. I exhausted a Warden of Healing to heal the damage). I committed 6 vs 2 so added 1 progress to the active Mountains of Mirkwood, exploring it (I searched Sam Gamgee, Warden of Healing, Gandalf (OHAUH), Henamarth Riversong and Wingfoot, added Henamarth Riversong to my hand and shuffled the rest back into my deck) and added 3 progress to stage 1B, exploring it.

 

I opted to risk travelling to the other Mountains of Mirkwood, drawing Enchanted Stream and adding it to the staging area.

 

At the end of the round I refreshed everything and increased my threat to 31.

I paid 2 from Aragorn to play Keen Longbow on himself and paid 1 from Aragorn to play Henamarth Riversong, then exhausted Henamarth to look at the top card of the encounter deck.

 

Knowing what I needed to do I exhausted Asfaloth to add 2 progress to the active Mountains of Mirkwood (exploring it, I searched Hasty Stroke, Gandalf (OHAUH), another Gandalf (OHAUH), Fast Hitch and Magic Ring, added Magic Ring to my hand and shuffle the rest back into my deck), played Elrond's Counsel twice, buffing both Wardens of Healing and lowering my threat to 25 and committed Glorfindel (for 3, without exhausting) and 2x Warden of Healing (for 2 each), then drew Old Forest Road, adding it to the staging area.

DECK-TESTING: THE MINES OF MORIA (GAME 1).

 

I decided to use the happy coincidence of working on a new solo deck at about the same time as getting the Moria-based packs to use them for a little fine-tuning.
