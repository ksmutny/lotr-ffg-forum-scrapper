Can you activate multiple hounur guards at the same time. For instance hero takes 3 damage, you exaust 3 three honour guards to cancel all the damage?

Since they are responding to the same event, I don't see why not.

For reference, Honour Guard's text specifically says the following: Exhaust Honour Guard to cancel the first point of damage just dealt to a character, which makes it quite a bit more ambiguous.

 

Edit: I'm not sure why they would use "first" if it was not to limit it to just one damage per instance of damage, but I am pretty sure I've used multiple Honour Guards to cancel multiple points of damage from a single character in the past.  It looks like that might be incorrect, though.

No it doesn't. It says 1 point of damage, which makes it not ambiguous at all.

Interesting, I pulled the text from cardgamedb.  The image shows the correct text, however.

 

I guess that explains why I've used multiple Honour Guards before.

Interesting! Perhaps the card text changed during development.

So... because I play with the card and not  cardgamedb, I go with the text that is on the card.  -_- [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sleep.png]
