Hi there,

Can I play events and actions during the encounter and combat phases? Or any other phases after questing?

Thanks.

Yeah, check out the back of the core set manual.  You can use Actions or play Event cards (which are either Actions or Responses) whenever you are in the green boxes ("action windows") in that chart.  It's actually more complicated than that though, so consult the manual closely about a particular phase if you have a question.  For example, you have an action window after each step of enemy attack resolution, and this information is included in the prose explanation of the combat phase in the core set manual, but not really well reflected in that chart in the back of the book.

To be more precise, as GrandSpleen mentioned, some events are Responses - these do not require an action window, you can play them any time a certain trigger happens (which is specified on the card).

Events which are Actions can be played in any action window as he described.

Some events are more specific and say things like "Planning action" or "Combat action". As you might infer, these can only be played in in an action window during the specific phase to which they refer.

thanks a lot! (I've only started using this forum so sorry about the excessive quote).
