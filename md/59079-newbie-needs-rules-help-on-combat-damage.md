While I am not new to games (hardcore board gamer) I am new to card games and bought LOTR TCG to play with my son.  I'm a fan so far, but on our first trial run thru the rules in a practice game, we hit a snag.  I've searched the forums and didn't see an answer to this, perhaps because it is very elementary.  I'll apologize now for my ignorance!  On page 18, resolving enemy attacks, step 4: determine combat damage I have the following questions:

Where it says "If an attack is undefended, all damage from the attack must be assigned to a single hero controlled by the active player".  Does that mean that any of your hero's, whether committed to the quest or not, can take the damage?  Or does it have to be given to the character that is being attacked?  Or does it mean any committed hero's on that quest can take the hit?  I'm assuming to the character being attacked. 

Where is says "Allies cannot take damage from undefended attacks."  What does this mean?  Is it in reference to the previous sentence?  Or does it mean a that an ally on a quest can't take damage for an undefended hero?  Or that an ally not on a quest can't take damage?  Or that an undefended ally can't take damage and the hero(s) must take it?

And just for my own knowledge, why doesn't a characters defense (armor) number reduce the damage he/she takes on an attack?  Maybe I've played too many games of Descent, but I just don't get the "why" behind this.

In short, if someone would please take the time to explain to me this section on how to dole out damage, I would very much appreciate it.  You would also make a nine year old who loves LOTR a very happy young man!

I doubt this will be my only question as a newb, so thanks in advance for answering.  Also, if there is a basic newb question string I should be reading, please point me in the right direction!

Thank you!  gran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif]

Okay..sounds like your are all turned around but no fear we can fix you up. In a given round your characters can only do 1 of the following - Commit to the quest, Defend an attack, or attack an enemy.

The difference between a defended attack and an undefended attack is basically choosing whether or not you are going to declare a defender against a single enemie's attack  by exhausting a character you control (whether it be an ally or Hero) to subtract it's defense strength against the enemies attack.

If you choose to defend with a character you must exhaust him then the shadow card is flipped (apply any effects) then subtract the total enemy attack strength against your characters total defense strength. The difference is how much damage you put on that character.

If you choose not to defend an attack (whether is your choice or not) after flipping the shadow card (apply any effects) you must put all the damage done by the enemy on one of your heroes. (Which sucks) . You can choose any hero you want whether they quested, already exhausted or still readied but it has to be a hero.

Deciding what your heros/allys do each round is a big part of this game. Sometime you can't afford to quest because of the number of enemies in play is to great. Or sometimes the threat is so great that you can't spare characters to defend or attack enemies you are engaged with.

 

Here is an example of the combat phase. I will use the core Tactic deck for this....Assume this is a solo player game

At the beginning of the Combat phase:

Thalin is exhausted because he commited to the quest.
Gimili and Legolas are both Readied

A Forest Spider engages you during the engagement checks and now at the point where the Spider is going to attack.

You must decided right then if you are going to exhaust (tap) either Gimili or Legolas to defend the Spider's attack.

(Example of Defending )

You decided to declare Gimili as a Defender (by exhausting him) against the Spider's attack. 

 Then you reveal the shadow card (for this example nothing happens)

I believe the forest spider gets +1 Attack strength when it engages a player so it now has an attack strength of 3
Then you compare that total to Gimili's defense strength of 2. 
3-2 = 1 so you place 1 point of damage on Gimli

 

(Example of not Defending)

This time you decide that you rather leave both of your heros readied to be able to attack the spider.

You declare that the attack will not be defended and you reveal the shadow effect. 
The shadow effect of the card says the attacking enemy gets +1 attack strength (or +3 if this attack is undefended)

This mean that the spider is now dealing 6 damage (because it got +1 from it's card text and +3 from the shadow effect)

This means that you must place 6 damage on one of your heroes. (which that would kill any of them that you choose).  Even if you had an ally in play it cannot be assigned the undefended damage.

 

In short, always think long and hard before leaving an attack undefended.

I also personally recommend searching the LOTR:LCG [http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/77423/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-card-game] site on Board Game Geek for files that will be helpful.

The one I use the most:

FAQ 5.1 [http://files.boardgamegeek.com/file/download/83bdtagp5q/LoTR_LCG_Cards_and_FAQs_v5.1.pdf?] - Lists all the cards for LOTR:LCG and answers any FAQ's that have been asked about that card. AMAZING!!! This has helped a lot with specific card questions. It compiles FAQ's from several forums and discussion groups as well as FFG's list of official FAQ's.

You will also find several goodies in there!

custom faqs are not a good idea.. just use official rules and the official faq. Not to say a lot in the bbg faq isn't good infomation, but many of them are just opinions that are not "true". The entire reason that people ask some questons is that the rules are not clear. There have already been some mega retractions in that faqs history were they got somthing tottaly wrong. It is a good start for a nw player, but just remeber that NOTHING in there is set in stone... the only place that matters is card text, official rule book and official faq.
