# [LoTR:LCG will not cover the story in the books?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58341-lotrlcg-will-not-cover-the-story-in-the-books/)

A friend of mine just told me that FFG only has the rights to publish games that cover the timeline between the Hobbit and the start of the Fellowship of the Ring. Is this true? If it is true, I guess that means we won't see any quests that directly relate to the plot in the books. It certainly explains why this flagship game has so far failed to include the main questline from the books.

Assuming that this is true and not just rumor, what material could FFG draw from to create interesting quests in future expansions?

Correct me if I'm wrong, but aren't we already making connections with the 'core story' helping Gandalf hunt Gollum? I'm assuming that FFG has the rights to LotR as a whole, and are limited to the third age of Middle Earth. I think Tolkien's estate has always been pretty cautious about handing out licensing rights to the Silmarillion (First and Second Age.) which is a shame, because that's when all the interesting stuff happens! D:


I want a Gil-galad hero card!


I'm actually glad that we aren't following in the shadow of the Fellowship. I love Frodo's journey as much as the next guy, but I'm kind of sick of following it in every LotR game that comes out. I'm loving the little short stories we've got- they really flesh out Middle Earth.


As far as future APs go... I can't wait for Fangorn to come around. <3

I'm curious why you group the Second Age with the Silmarillion?

I'd love to see Ent-based cards but i can't see them coming around unless we have an expansion based on Fangorn or at least includes some questing around Rohan or Isengard. Like you, tho, I'm hopeful!

 Sorry, I always forget how vague the Second Age is.  

I always lump it in with The Silmarillion.  I guess most of that stuff is in Unfinished Tales, right?  The making of the Rings of Power, and the Last Alliance - all that good stuff.

In Lotr book was a lot about Gil-Galad. So you can get him easy dont worry. Everything what was somehow describing in the Lotr book can be done as a card.

 They mention him, but he's dead at that point. D:

It was stated in an interview with Nate French as I recall that the only have the license to cover things which happen between the hobbit and the lord of the rings............that´s 17 years. No Silmarillion

Aragorn´s search for Gollum takes place in that time.

The Quests so far fit into that timeframe.

I don´t think it´s too limiting for them to make up stories.

And there is no

it is a real shame the Silmarillion can not be included, some of Tolkins best stories are in those ages

best place to get these events and a timeline are in the appendix of ROTK, and just because the events cant be told doesnt mean the places cant be....we can travel to anywhere in the third age and FFG can work around that....shire (cant wait) bree, old forest, barrow downs, rohan,isengard,fangorn, lorien,eregion, erebor, mordor, gondor, iron hills, the list is a mile long for what they could do....and there are plenty of side storys that could be written for each area not directly related to the books, most areas were elaborated on by tolkien or his son at some point or another, or at least given a passage in the appendices, so i dont think they need touch the trilogy events anyways

the main limiting factor is theme....for example they cannot have gil galad in it, he was long gone by the third age, also they cannot (i assume) create things out of nowhere, such as LOTR Online do this far too much, Angmar for instance was rebuilt in their game and vastly populated, however we are told in TFOTR that angmar is no longer a threat, i would hate for FFG to start creating contradictions to the author of the entire works of middle earth

The timeline they have licence for didn't limit space, but it surely limit characters... Gil Galahad shouldn't be seen here... nor Balin since your team is gonna see what happened to him in the Mine of Moria.

There is still place for great adventures without caring of the Hobbit or LOTR, like taking back Arwen to her father in Rivendell.

Does that mean we are never going to see Merry, Pippin or Sam Characters?

Why not? We´ve seen Frodo.

Rulebook, page 2:

These quests take place during a timespan of 17 years: from when Bilbo celebrates his 111th birthday (and Frodo's 33rd) to days just prior to Frodo leaving the Shire.

In addition to the Hunt for Gollum, Transport of Arwen, and the Massing at Osgiliath, there are other adventures that could happen.

I'm hoping that we see Bilbo's journey after his birthday party: to Rivendell, Dale, and back to Rivendell.

looking at the appendix, another point of interest around the games year base, is that saruman beigns to use the orthanc stone, and is corrupted by sauron uing the ithil stone...plenty of rich storylines there....and yes we should see all the characters you love, i mean we've seen heros included in adventure packs that ont relate to the quest (imrahil is a good example)

 Bilbo's Party takes place in TA 3001

Eowyn was born in TA2995

that puts her age at between 6 and 23 during the period of these quests.

Add to that the number of members of the Fellowship we have questing together long before they meet, or even the fact that Denethor as the ruling steward and a bit of a parnoid nut is actually leaving Minas Tirith, and it's already clear that we're having to play a bit fast and loose with chronology and events.

If they could get the license I'd love to see some Hobbit-era stuff appear in a deluxe expansion/ as a stand-alone product maybe around next Christmas time, but we've still got plenty of other material that will fit within the fairly loose parameters that have been set.

 If we 86 the hobbits, we lose out on the Old Toby.  I think we can all agree that this would be a very bad thing.
