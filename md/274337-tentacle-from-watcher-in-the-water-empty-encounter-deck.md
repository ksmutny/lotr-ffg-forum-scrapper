# [Tentacle from Watcher in the Water - Empty Encounter deck](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/274337-tentacle-from-watcher-in-the-water-empty-encounter-deck/)

Rules say that if encounter deck is ever empty in the questing phase, one should reshuffle it. What if a character attacks/get attacked by a tentacle (their effects ask to discard a card from the encounter deck and trigger if the card is another tentacle or have shadow effect) and the deck is empty? Do I get a free pass, because its a combat phase (like with shadow cards)?

You would get a free pass and the tentacle's ability would whiff.

P.S.: Realised I made the thread in general forum and not in rules questions...
