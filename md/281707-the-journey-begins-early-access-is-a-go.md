It says that the limited edition two player starter/collectors edition is still available; so if you haven't placed your order, there's still time.

I still had hopes this would never happen.

That it wouldn’t still be available?

I'd say, that the digital version will never be available for the public adience.

I just messed around with the starter deck in the first quest. Had a lot of fun, even though the quest finished a little anticlimactic as Sauron seemed to run out of enemies. Anyway, going to replay it tomorrow with a self build deck and check out hard mode.

I am just a little sad quite some heroes they showed during their streams aren't currently available in an way (yeah I know they will show up eventually).

How exactly do you get the early access?  Do you have to purchase one of the packs?

You can buy one of the founder's packs (or the Limited Edition Collector's Starter Set) to get early access now, or wait for full release; when it will be free-to-play.

May not last long.

Note that the higher tier founder packs appear to be traps, and the most cost-effective approach is to start with the cheapest pack (or wait for EA to finish and get no pack at all) and then purchase quests and heroes up to your budget.
