Hi.

I need a complete set of the Mirkwood cycle. Thought I'd wait for the reprints here in June. But I can see they have been delayed to Q3. Anyone know of a site still having anyone in stock?

German or english?

www.planetharry.com

 

It is a small gamestore in Vienna/Austria. He does send worldwide and on saturday he still had everything except long dark, watcher and foundations.

 

Just email him. Prices are 11€ per pack.

Muemakan: I've now got all 6 ap's on their way in the mail. So thank you so much for your tip. It saved me a lot of time and money also. I'll let everyone know where to buy the Mirkwood cycle in another thread. You are the man :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Miniature Market and Lotus Vault is where I order mine. Both good places. Sometimes eBay and Amazon.

Yes, I mostly buy from miniature market also. But most places are out of stock on this cycle. Great site with good service and super prices.
