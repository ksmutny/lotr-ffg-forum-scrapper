Any word on when this AP will be shipping? Got to be pretty soon, I expect. Really looking forward to it.

The pack will be released early at Con of the Rings next week. German retailers are saying the week after the con, so probably around October 10th, maybe sooner. 
In any case, the pack is on its way and I for one cannot wait to start building decks with the new cards and with the new Contract! Though I feel that it's gonna be tricky to build a deck from my side-board with the contract, as those contracts seem to limit your cardpool somewhat (No non-unique allies, no allies at all....)

## 3 [Felswrath on September 26, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/300444-wrath-and-ruin/?do=findComment&comment=3793666)

Do we know if this pack will include a Contract? It is certainly possible. And I definitely think we'll get a contract of Bilbo's agreement with the dwarves at some point. It was mentioned in the rulebook for A Shadow in the East.

Woohoo!  Hope this is all correct!  I've got this pack, along with the new AH deluxe and Champions Core Set all pre-ordered at MM and waiting til all are available to be delivered.  I was a bit worried that this pack would be the item to delay the whole order.

I think it will. Would be odd if the Deluxe and the second AP have contracts, but the first AP doesn't. I'm expecting one contract for each expansion to come. That would put us at 7 contracts, which opens up a lot of deckbuilding choices.
I also hope that we get a Bilbo/Company contract soon. It's the one where an actual contract had to be signed, so it makes sense to get it into cardform soon. Perhaps focusing on his Burglar nature. As for other contracts, I think a Grey Company one would make sense, as that is a group of people that haven't gotten a card yet outside of the Sagas. Perhaps some army cards as well, but I have no clue on the phrasing on those contracts, hope they will be as fun as the two contracts we've gotten so far. They seem to break norms, so I wonder what others could be broken.

Those who have access early -- dont forget to spoil! We all love having some cards to look forward to while we wait!

## 7 [General_Grievous on September 29, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/300444-wrath-and-ruin/?do=findComment&comment=3795440)

Great idea and they have to do the Hobbit contract. I think something to boost Bilbo up alone would be awesome. Like your deck can only contain unique Dwarf characters and Bilbo/Gandalf, then some kind of plundering bonus like at the start of each round you may search the top 5 cards of your deck for an attachment and put it into play for no cost. 

 

So with that most likely one out of the way we are left with 4 potential lore contracts. Grey Company would be great especially if it boosted up both Dunedain and Rangers but honestly just a boost to the former would be huge. And that mysterious preview that has been right so far hinted at it.  

So I think for the last three:

-starting with an extra hero, no allies allowed, bonus to all stats 

- starting with one less or even just a solo hero and being able to ready at the beginning of each phase and a massive WP boost

-an army style one where all characters and heroes must have the same trait and each round you can play one ally with that trait for free

Cardboard of the Rings will be doing a livestream of hot takes on the player cards like they did last year (hopefully with yours truely again): 



There have been some problems with the FFG shipping, so it isn't 100% confirmed that we will have the pack at the con, but if we do, we will send the spoilers for sure!

I take it the pack was not release at event?

The AP was not released early at the event.

The Con event coordinators said that there had been some logistical issues. The AP had not yet been unloaded (or arrived in MN). It was vague and I'm not even sure the Event Center knew exactly why.

No word from either Con of the Rings or Germany so far. I would imagine the pack being released before the end of the month, though FFG is already past their deadline of Q3 2019 at this point, so who knows?
I'm sure that once the new cards have been received by community members, we will hear about it.

I went back to the previous cycle and found the average time between announcements of the packs and when it they were available for purchase. It was 130 days. If that holds true for this cycle then Wrath and Ruin will be available around November 8th and The City of Ulfast January 19th. We might get the announcement of the third pack around the same time as the release of Wrath and Ruin.

I know this won't happen, but you know what'll be nice? If FFG just released these packs once a month like it was suppose to be from the start (hasn't been that way for years sadly). We get the last set of cards sooner, and the hiatus starts sooner as well. Just one last nod to the fans instead of languishing and waiting and waiting and waiting. What's the hold up FFG? /rant

It's possible.  A few years ago "On the Boat" used to mean anywhere between 3-6 months of waiting as the slow ship crossed the Pacific and spent huge amounts of time in queue at the port.

Lately, though "On the Boat" has basically meant nothing, and seems to be an afterthought of whoever runs the products pages.  In some recent cases, "On the Boat" has been updated less than a week before product hits shelves.

So, it's a total mystery each time... which keeps it interesting!

Wow those are some good cards. And a lot of interplay with some of the newer cards (Haldan, Lotheriel, Bilbo, etc). What an excellent pack.

The contract seems great and fun to play. So far is the one looking more intriguing to me.

New decks coming. Essentially increased deck size and built in card draw.

It's going to take some reflection and conversations to convince me. 14 *different* attachments and the only way to get them out is to travel. That means 14 rounds to get them all out. If you NEED any attachment to make your deck work, this is not the deck for you.

But I could see a swarm deck working -- and attachments are more boons and less necessary. I could see a dwarf deck working in this. 

Haldan is great with this contract, but only on a deck that complements the contract. Because you cannot load up attachments or run more than one copy of an attachment in your loot deck, it doesn't make sense to run it that way. But if your buddy is running that contract, Haldan is a great hero to run on the other side.

 

Any other tricks you can see?

I understand your points. I did not say it is the strongest contract,  just the one more intriguing to me. I would probably build a boost side contract deck to increase stats on characters on the board. It's true that the items /artifacts must be different and that you cannot choose what to play but on the other side you do not pay for them and ignore the guarded keyword. 

 

Not the contract for deck built on key attachment but a great contract for general use decks that do not relay on specific attachment but can profit for stats boost.

On top of that you can fit many more allies and events in your deck opening to different deck building approaches.  

And yes, synergy with haldan in the other deck is a nice upside to location attachment archetype.

Also 1 card on 14 is a quite high drawing percentage.

Re reading the contract I'm not totally sure anymore that guarded objectives will be "free" after the active location is explored.  The text say to put the card into play, not 100% sure this would bypass the guarded keyword at this point. This would greatly reduce the contract appeal...

I would assume the "ignore guarded keyword" is the work around.

It is a bit confusing, since I cannot recall another instance where we put a card into play that is already in play, as this contract seems to have us do. (Otherwise, you have to assume the card is out of play when attached by the contract to the active location, which I don't think is tenable.)

And player Guarded (X) only triggers when the attachment first enters play (as set out in the Wilds of Rhovanion rules [http://www.lotr-lcg-quest-companion.gamersdungeon.net/#the-wilds-of-rhovanion-deluxe-expansion-quest-lost-in-mirkwood]), and the contract specifically turns off the Guarded (X) keyword at that moment, so I think we're good.

If the contract works eliminating in full the guarded keyword,  then the contract is quite good and open to several possibilities.

Otherwise,  it would be most probably limited to a very niche decks.

Agreed! Though maybe that would make it a bit OP if every time an enemy came out Bilbo could over quest it's threat, do 2 damage and then put a free attachment into play?  I dunno...Of course, as is it synergizes with Haldan in a similar, but less thematic way.  Oh well....still an interesting card!

I wonder what kind of probability that new contract has compared to a standard fifty card deck. Fourteen cards obviously increases the chance of seeing a card you want earlier, but card draw effects won't work like they do with the player deck.

And there's no search feature. Nothing that accelerates. And no repeats.

 

I'm not sold on it -- I'd like to see a deck that uses this well. I'm withholding judgement until I've had more time to reflect. Yes the free play is nice especially on expensive ones (ancestrial armor and citadel plate come to mind), there is no need for sphere matching either, but man that seems like a pretty steep cost to not have anything other than one of any item or artifact (skills, songs and titles are banned in this deck)

Exactly! I'm still of the opinion that it's a great contract, if your deck focuses on having a lot of basic weapons on your heroes.

Not only that, but it actually requires traveling to locations, which many decks try to do as little of as possible (e.g. Asfaloth, Northern Trackers, etc.).  Given that it requires traveling to locations, realistically it will probably only get out 3-6 cards from the deck.  Still, 3-6 cards of guarded caliber isn't bad, and it's certainly fun, but it'll be hard-pressed to find a deck willing to give up on running cards like Steward of Gondor, Unexpected Courage, and the like.

I think it is a pretty nice contract for multiplayer. Your mates can play attachments for you and you have a location pretty much every round to travel to, garantueeing a free item or artifact nearly every round, bonus points if these are guarded (x).

This seems like a handy contract for decks that are ally/event heavy -- you can fill up a stack of useful attachments to get for free along the way, while ignoring sphere, cost, and guarded considerations.  It's kind of like having an attachment Vilya.
