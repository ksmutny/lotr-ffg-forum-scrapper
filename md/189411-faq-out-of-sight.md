In the faq rulebook it writes:

Out of Sight                                                      D 81
Should read: “Action: Enemies engaged with you
cannot attack you this phase.”
 
 
 
....i don't see what it changes. Am i missing anything?

I think this change was made for enemies like the Balrog that engage and attack all players. You cannot prevent all his attacks using Out of Sight, only his attack against yourself.

The original card said "cannot attack this phase," they changed it to "cannot attack you this phase."

Yeah, that was the Balrog change.  Feint and Thicket of Spears say the same thing.

I sometimes thought they canceled the secrecy keyword.
