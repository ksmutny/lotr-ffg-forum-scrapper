I bought the AP "The hunt for Gollum", and played a couple of games.

I enjoyed the flavor of the scenario, that reminded me a short film of 2009. Here it is:

seen it - its ok…….for me though it missed an opportunity to be more 'book' central….instead of copying the film style

True. It did have some nice elements though. I especially liked the pronunciation of Strider's skills (not the out-right combat though). They really should have found a better looking Arwen, I feel a bit bad saying that but it is a simple fact, she just didn't look very pretty. But neither does LT look totally awesome as Arwen should - and those films had pretty much everybody to choose from.

yeah i didnt like arwen…..granted liv tyler is very attractive, but i felt arwen was to be a different type of attractive, sort of other worldly… mesmerising (ie just like an elf)…..i think the artwork for arwen is pretty close to what i imagined
