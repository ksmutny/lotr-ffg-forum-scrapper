ive seen a similar topic on here, but i was wanting some specific input

 

has anyone else had their cards bending/ curling up? i live in a really cold house, with basically a coal fire to heat, and here in nothern uk its getting to the minus tempteratures in dead of winter, and i think the cold and damp is getting to them. does this sound like what is causing this?

 

i dont want to use card sleeves, not getting into that discussion, but thats my answer to that.  I can find ways to heat the room if it is actually the cold, but i want to make sure before i spend the money on heating it!

I have not had this problem at all, and I once left my cards out all night on the pourch and it went -10 that night. I use clear plastic dragon shield card sleves though.

I do sleeve my cards and I find that sometimes they bend a little bit. Not enough for me to really worry about though. I find that they seem to go back to flat after a while. I'm sure the cards do bend some with temperature changes but it seems like they'd go back to normal once returned to a normal temperature.

Move to North Carolina Rich! We can get an apartment together! ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] I always need roommates, and one who plays this game, well, you can't top that!

I live in a really warm & humid climate (Brisbane, Australia) and I've noticed that cards can curl here. I also play MTG and It seems to happen more with foil cards. I also use Dragonshield - they're the best. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Impressive. Most impressive.  I would never desire to move anywhere else.
