Just 2 quick questions about this combo. Gimli having 5 hitpoint will get 9 hit point with the Citadel plate. Will his attack point be able to grow to max 6 or max 10 before he dies? And when there's 4 damage tokens on the citadel plate will it still be in play or is it automatically discarded? Any thoughts on this?

The Citadel Plate adds health to the hero it is attached to, it does not take damage separately. Therefore it will not be destroyed by damage, only be card effects that target attachments.

That also means that yes, Gimli's attack can grow very large with a Citadel plate.

 It also means that should the Citadel Plate get discarded then Gimli is just sitting on whatever damage he's taken (which can then lead to the discarding of Gimli).

 Gimli + Citadel Plate = AWESOME! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] Though, I hope they make some sick Dwarven armor in Kaz.
