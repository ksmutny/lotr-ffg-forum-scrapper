 Can you use this response to move a location from staging to active if you currently have no active location?

No, you cannot. 

West Road Traveler's ability reads, "Response: After you play West Road Traveler from your hand, switch the active location with any other location in the staging area." If there is no active location, it is impossible to "switch" the active location with one from the staging area. 

Even if you can't trigger the response, though, WRT is still a very solid ally; 2 willpower for 2 resources is pretty uncommon.
