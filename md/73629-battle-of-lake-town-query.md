I pre-ordered the Battle of Lake Town from the UK and I've received my copy today - looks like another great set.

The info page for this pack says 52 cards (http://store.fantasyflightgames.com/productdetails.cfm?SKU=oMEC35 [http://store.fantasyflightgames.com/productdetails.cfm?SKU=oMEC35]) - does this card count include the back cover card, the front cover card and the set up card? If so, I have all the cards, if not, is there a full card list anywhere?

 Try cardgamedb.

I went there in the end after posting, but your count sounds right since the other three cards are a back card, front cover card and play set up card.
