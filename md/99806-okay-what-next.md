You've all been a super helpful group here, so I'd love to hear your opinion. 

 

We've played through the Mirkwood Cycle... a lot, played though the Hobbit (first set) several times, and are ready to hit another adventure. Where should we go from here? (can't find the second hobbit at the moment or we'd do that).

 

Keep in mind: we'll be playing through everything sooner or later. Second, it's totally your opinion: what would you do.

 

Thanks!

I'd play Khazad Dum, ooooh when i remember my old times... I'd like return to live them. This is my idea: play the player cards as they were released in his moment. So i'd get the adventures, expansions, etc... by progression series.

Yeah go Khaz... that entire cycle is really good.

Hello,

 

I'm also leaning to buy Khazad-Dûm. Anyone knows where to buy it in Europe? I'm having an hard time find a store with it in stock, which is weird, since it just got reprinted.

 

Thanks!

Khazadum and its following cycle are really enjoyable, I'd definitely go for those.
