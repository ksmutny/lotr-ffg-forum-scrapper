Looking for an answer to a scoring question:

 

Obviously it's not great if a player is eliminated in the quest to win a scenario but sometimes heroic sacrifices are necessary! Our playgroup likes to keep scores of our adventures, but we weren't sure how to score this situation.

Does an eliminated player (for whatever reason) receive 50 for threat + ## for sum of their heroes threat values + 0 for damage on heroes?

 

Thanks in advance.

 Yes, that's exactly how you do it.
