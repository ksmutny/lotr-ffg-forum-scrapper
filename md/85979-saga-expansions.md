So does anybody know how many Saga expansions ffg will make for each book?  Do you think it will be same like Hobbit? Or do you guys think 3? 

 

Also, what do you guys think about the quests?  Cuz its kinda confusing to me since Khazad-Dum is VERY simular to what happened in the book and people won't like another quest about when the fellowship goes through KD if its pretty much the same....I wonder what they will do to solve that problem.  Same goes with Carhadres (however you spell it) Dead Marshes, Watcher in the Water, And Siege of Cair Andros is not a whole lot differant than the siege of Minis Tirith.  plus more.....

 

What do you guys think?

The Saga Expansions are not meant to be "the books" or w/e. We will defiantly see some major plot lines from the books in them, but they are not going to be telling the story of the books. They are just set in the books and focus on a "part" of the book. For example The Battle of Helms Deep would make a great Saga expansion. An entire series that just tells this one battle, 6 interconnected quests. Stuff like that... or we could see a Saga Expantion on Fairimer defending Henneth Annûn for example... something only mentioned in the books.

 

I think that the Saga expansions are what this game should always have been. When most people talk to me about this game what they are looking for is a quest orientated game dripping in theme. The Saga expansions seam to be FFG trying to pull the game back towards this by allowing special rules that esist only for that expansion, allowing them to make much more interesting and thematic quests as they are not bound by the general rules of the main game.

 

As for how many? I think we will see 2-4 a year every year this game is out.

## 3 [Khamul The Easterling on July 8, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85979-saga-expansions/?do=findComment&comment=809848)

So these are going to be totally differant then the Hobbit saga expanions?  cuz in the Hobbit Saga expansions, both boxes followed the books very closely and went through all the main events in the book.  I assumed that these upcoming Saga expanions would do the same by following the 3 LOTR books and going through all the main events that happened like they did in the Hobbit.

## 4 [Pharmboys2013 on July 8, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85979-saga-expansions/?do=findComment&comment=809853)

I would think it'll be two per book like the hobbit boxes.  I think for the 2nd fellowship box it'll condense what we had in the darrowdelf cycle.  Where the first two quests will possibly involve caradhas, the watcher, and moria and the last quest would be the skirmish at rauros falls.  I think it would be really cool if for the rauros falls quest there was an objective Boromir who took damage each turn.  The quest would then have to be completed before Boromir dies (although he would need a lot of HP for this to be feasable)

## 5 [booored on July 8, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85979-saga-expansions/?do=findComment&comment=809854)

we will see, but I do not think it will be like this.. at least I hope it will not be. The events may be close to the books but they are not encompassing the books, only sections of it. If they don't then as people have said everything will double up. I guess we will see but I strongly doubt we are looking at a linear progression though the events of the books, but instead parts of the books examined in great detail.

## 6 [Pharmboys2013 on July 8, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85979-saga-expansions/?do=findComment&comment=809869)

well even if they are "examining" portions of the books in "great detail" it still seems they are doing so in a linear fashion starting with the first book and going from the escape of the shire, battle at weather-top, and flight to the ford.  As with most debate the true answer will likely fall somewhere in the middle

## 7 [GrandSpleen on July 8, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85979-saga-expansions/?do=findComment&comment=809875)

I'm hoping for 3 per book, since there is just so much ground to cover.  I do definitely think we'll be seeing a linear progression of quests meant to recreate the storyline of The Lord of the Rings in exactly the same way that the two Hobbit boxes aimed to recreate The Hobbit.  It's been stated in no uncertain terms in the preview that revealed the Black Riders expansion:

 

"As in the game’s other Saga Expansions, The Hobbit: Over Hill and Under Hill [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_npm.asp?eidm=136] and The Hobbit: On the Doorstep [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_npm.asp?eidm=167&epmi=s], each scenario in The Black Riders follows the events of the classic story by J.R.R. Tolkien as faithfully as possible. . . . It is the first of a series of Saga expansions that eventually will allow players to replay Frodo's epic journey from the Shire to Mount Doom, as well the dramatic events experienced by other members of the Fellowship."

 

So I expect it will be just like The Hobbit, putting in as much of the book as they can.  They will have to skip parts just because there is too much to fit in, again as they did with The Hobbit (no capture by the elves of Mirkwood, for example).

 

I wonder, too, how they will differentiate the saga quests from some of the existing quests, but they already ran into this problem with the Hobbit boxes.  Flies and Spiders is similar in theme to Passage through Mirkwood, but they are very different scenarios.  But Conflict at the Carrock is just like We Must Away Ere Break of Day -- those scenarios are not radically different in terms of gameplay and general strategy.  So I guess we've already seen both sides of that coin.

 

In a way it's fortunate that we haven't seen the LotR storyline until now.  The team has had more time to refine their approach in making unique quests that stand apart from one another.  I do think we'll see some more duplicated themes, like the party going through Moria, but I expect those scenarios will have some unique mechanics that will set them apart from the Khazad-dum expansion and Dwarrowdelf APs.

What makes you think that?  What proof do you have?  Why wouldn't it be different from the previous same type of expansion Hobbit boxes?  having 6 quests on Helms Deep idea is more like a video game not this game.  

## 9 [booored on July 8, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85979-saga-expansions/?do=findComment&comment=809888)

no proof. This is what I think though. What proof do you have that it is not? It isn't like the Hobbit boxes told the entire story.. they focus and told specific parts of the story. I expect this to continue. Still people my be right.. but i doubt it.. at least I hope the boxes won't. It will really suck to have double up on so much of the content. The way I am talking about will have a the same deep thematic quests but allow them to pull stories and lines of play from all over the books, restricting to a linear progression though the books would be a terrible mistake.. and probably hurt sales, as why would you want to buy the same quests a 2nd time. People that post here will not mind as they are fanboys, but the average gamer will not buy a box with quest lines they have already paid for in cycles.

I am afraid, as GrandSpleen already pointed out, FFG already spoiled that it's going to be just like how it was done with The Hobbit and it's going to be awesome.

## 11 [booored on July 8, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85979-saga-expansions/?do=findComment&comment=809918)

exactly.. it is already said by FFG that they are going to follow the hobbit example and focus on small parts of the story.. am am surprised people are thinking otherwise.

## 12 [GrandSpleen on July 8, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85979-saga-expansions/?do=findComment&comment=809919)

I think everybody agrees here, they just don't realize it.

## 13 [richsabre on July 8, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85979-saga-expansions/?do=findComment&comment=810000)

the lord of the rings, despite popular belief (though most here will of course know this already), is not a trilogy. it's a single novel, consisting of 6 books published in 3 volumes....

that is 2 books per fellowship,towers and king

 

i dont say this to be pedantic....because i feel its important to the way things will work if ffg go this way...

the black rider is book 1. we get 3 quests in that. therefore i simply think each book = 3 quests therefore there will be 18 quests in all....6 saga packs

 

i think this will be over 3 years, no more than 2 saga packs per year, and 1 cycle in those years

 

so that is over the next 3 years:

6 saga packs

3 deluxe packs and cycles

 

i see no problem at all with the quests. as others have said you can make 2 quests in the same place very different by their mechanics

however if  ffg dont want to do this there is so much material they coud easily skip over certain areas.

they cannot, at least i hope they wont skip over the major areas such as khazad dum, but in the next pack for instance, we could have;

 

'passage through moria' - this would have to feel different to khazad dum and dwarrowdelf

'flight to lothlorien' - completely new area

'attack on the great river' - again new area..

 

EDITED - wrote alot about frodo and sam splitting with the company and how they would deal with having 3 parties in each pack, before i realised that frodo and sam are in a whole other book!

 

so the interesting thing is, if i stay with the idea of ffg going down the 'books' route, then will we see a pack completely devoted to frodo and sam? becuase that is afterall how the volumes are split up - gandalf, aragorn, merry pippin etc. in the first book (1 saga pack) then frodo and sam in the next (2nd saga pack)

 

seems a little strange but it may be the best way for it to work. there is such a big difference to frodo and sams journey compared with the others it would seem a little wierd to have both in 3 quests.

I don't know what your thinking.....The Hobbit boxes covered every single part of the journey that wasn't just wandering or talking.  They did not include: First part with unexpected party ( I dont see how they could have made that into a  quest.) Then they didn't include Rivendel (Can't make a quest out of that) Then they didn't include the short stay with the eagles (cant make a quest of that) they didnt include beorn (nothing to do for that) I suppose just maybe that they could have included something with the elven King but prob not. Then from there on they covered just about all of the book.  I don't see what parts that they skipped in the HObbit boxes and only focused on main parts.  

 

Don't mean to sound offensive or mean,

THANK YOU RICH!!!

The Lord of the Rings 'Trilogy' is a retelling that belongs to Peter Jackson. The Lord of the Rings is a single novel split into three volumes for economic feasibility (because printing in Britain was expensive in the 1950s).

To tell the true i like idea of the adventure pack with some new story rhrn in the book. Previous card game already done this a lot.

But why not? I love art of the cards....

you're welcome :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

im very pleased that ffg decided to go down the books route. im not sure if it was intentional....of course it makes sense to split such a large volume into parts even if they werent, and there's a natural stopping point in rivendell.

on a not completely unrelated point i saw the most awful thing recently....the hobbit book, only in two parts! who would of knew that decades after existing perfectly fine as 1 novel, it would be 'reinvented' in two parts??? :blink: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_blink.png]

Well, there only are about 14 main parts in the Hobbit:

 

1. The whole first part with dwarves coming and party.

 

I wouldn't count the travel from Bag End to Trolls a main part

 

2. Trolls + the troll cave part

 

3. Rivendel 

 

4. Misty Mountains + Goblin King

 

5. Riddles in the Dark

 

6. Warg + Eagles

 

7. Beorn

 

8. Mirkwood

 

9. Elven dungeon + barrels 

 

10. LakeTown

 

11. Smaug 

 

12. battle of Laketown

 

13. Rebuilding of the wall of Erebor

 

14. Battle of 5 armies

 

 

Correct me if i missed any big parts.  

But I'd say that in the Hobbit Boxes they covered all the parts that had action and were able be made in to a quest. 

## 19 [richsabre on July 9, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85979-saga-expansions/?do=findComment&comment=810264)

yes- i think they did pretty well in the hobbit. i personally would prefer more emphasis on the adventuring part rather than the fighting parts...not sure if that will come across well. for instance, i love the 1b of road to rivendel. 20 progress points are nice becuase it gives the feeling of the wilderness.

in the hobbit i only got the adventuring feeling whenever i drew hobbit lands and the dreary hills. not that im saying the trolls/giants etc arent adventuring, they are a different type- an encounter type of adventure, whereas i want more travelling adventure.

 

this is of course difficult to do without making it boring, but i have high expectations for this style in the black rider at least, i really hope it conveys the style of the first book...which as i often say, i think is the best

That is insanely naive and misplaced.  Peter Jackson is really, really not responsible for the popular conceptualization of LotR as a trilogy.

Fine, New Line Cinema's marketing division is. Regardless, the movies are sold and referred to as a trilogy, the books are not (at least not correctly).

I agree with GrandSpleen. Just because lotr is techically one big novel split into 6 books divided in 3 novels doesn't mean it's not a trilogy. At least in my case long before the movies, lotr had always been a trilogy.

## 23 [John85 on July 9, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85979-saga-expansions/?do=findComment&comment=810431)

But it's not a trilogy. The volumes (i.e. FotR, TT, RotK) don't stand alone as individual narratives. One must read the entire Novel to get the story. Other trilogies (Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Iron Man, etc.) have installments that are episodic and do stand alone (Jackson's movies do stand alone as well, unlike the three volumes) and also create a larger narrative, that makes them trilogies.

EDIT: from Wikipedia:

> One of the most popular "trilogies" of fantasy [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy] books, The Lord of the Rings [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings] by J. R. R. Tolkien [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien], is not a trilogy, though it is often referred to as such. Tolkien regarded it as a single work and divided it into a prologue, six books, and five appendices. Because of post-World War II paper shortages, it was originally published in three volumes. It is still most commonly sold as three volumes, but has also been published in one-volume and seven-volume editions (six books and the appendices).

You totally missed my meaning.  Tolkien's original publishers are responsible for diving the series into a trilogy.  It has nothing to do with movies.  I get that movie bashing it totally chic among fans, but get your history straight.

## 25 [Pharmboys2013 on July 9, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85979-saga-expansions/?do=findComment&comment=810440)

Out of the examples above the same case can be made for star wars, each episode hardly stands alone but instead was crafted as one large sweeping saga, breaking off at either of the first two movies brings too many questions (who is the emperor? Han is in cryptonite? Darth is Luke's dad?)   Whereas the Indy and Iron Man movies have concrete endings (and more than 3 movies (we all know iron man 4 is coming))

 

There is obviously a large disconnect between what the lord of the rings was conceptualized to be and what its format has grown to become over time and I can see both points to arguing it either way....

 

that said....c'mon its a trilogy

Fair enough. That doesn't mean though that it was particularly because of the movies that it came to be considered a trilogy.

Definitely the second Saga Expansion of LOTR is when they'll have the biggest issue with repeating past scenarios, since much of the Dwarrowdelf cycle was just having us experience the Fellowship's adventures (Watcher, Caradhras, Moria). Judging by how they dealt with this in the Hobbit boxes, they won't shy away from repeating the scenarios, they'll just try to make them different enough that they feel like different quests. I think we can all agree that Flies and Spiders from On the Doorstep plays a lot different than Passage Through Mirkwood. I do wonder how Gandalf's stand against the Balrog will be represented. For the other Saga Expansions, they won't have to worry as much about repeating quest story lines.

I miss any Parts there?  Last Time I read the book was bout 3 years ago.  I LOVE the Tolkien Books, but don't read them like every year or something.  Better when you put a bigger space in between them I think.  So yeah just wondering how good my memory is of the book. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I was thinking about that.  Moria I think will be hard to tell. I think they will skip Caradhras or wind it into another quest. Really really hope to see new version of Cave Troll that's even bigger and badder than the 2 we have now.  I really hope they will capture the feel of fellowship fighting the Cave Troll.  But Watcher I can definitely see being able to make different.  Something like a watcher that is super powerful and engages you on the last quest stage and you have to make quite a few questing points to win before the watcher takes out you allies and Heroes.  Maybe some kind of effect like "Deal 3 damage to 3 characters you control after watcher engages you"  To get the feel of all his tentacles and how destructive he can be and running for you life while around your allies are getting grabbed by tentacles. :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

I don't recall the fellowship actually fighting the cave troll in the novels, just that Frodo stabbed it in the foot. That appeared in the movie (and it was done amazingly btw), but I think we may still see another cave troll if they make another Moria scenario.

Yeah. In the movie, it's the Cave Troll that stabs Frodo, after he so determinedly tries to find where Frodo is hiding even though there are what, 8 other people in the fellowship that could have well qualified as better targets. But in the book, it's actually an Orc Chieftain, or something of that nature, that stabs Frodo. It also mentions Black Uruks of Mordor, so we'll probably see those too. And you got the stab in the foot right. It actually says Boromir's blade couldn't cut through the skin (or scales or armour of some sort). So the troll that we could possibly face might have really high defense...

i really want to skip ahead of the battle i seemed to have started on the lord of the rings novel, as this isnt what this thread is about.., though i do have to do one last thing, more to just show how my statement was justified....here is a quote from the first paragraph of my lotr book.

 

"Note on the text: The Lord of the Rings is often erroneously called a trilogy, when it is in fact a single novel consisting of six books, plus appedices, sometimes published in three volumes...."

 

as i said originally, i didnt put that part in to wind people up, be pedantic etc etc. i put it in becuase i think it makes a considerable difference from a design point of view whether ffg takes it as 3 books, or 6. (see - it is relevant... :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] )

 

@mr.thomasshcmidt: no, i dont think its a different story, its just been dissected into two :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

@everyone. i think that we will surely see a gandalf objective ally in the flight from moria, and the battle with the balrog. we have tried to escape it, we have fought it ourselves, the only thing left to do is have an objective ally take it down...ie. gandalf

i think we shall either get key heros from the council of elrond.

i think

erestor or galdor

new gloin

new legolas

new gimli

we already have 2 boromirs

 

or most from lothlorien, it being the last key area before the breaking

new haldir

rumil / orophin

galadriel

celeborn

 

as for player card i think we shall see several attatchments from rivendell and lothlorien...lembas bread being one for sure, and the cloaks, the presents to the company...galadries hair to gimli should be an interesting one :lol: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_laugh.png]

If they only get one thing right in the Saga Expansions, it must be that we as players get a moment that allows us to shout "You shall not pass" to the Balrog (I know, I know, it's "you cannot pass" in the books, but the movie version and Ian McKellen's voice is pretty well burnt into my brain by now)

Can't say how much I like this as an idea!  Makes for a great themed quest.  But also will really make us all alter our decks (even just a little)...

Please no. As you said, people already include Gandalf in 95% of the decks they make, and they should consider that since these expansions are supposed to be played with one core set. Also, as I've said in other topics, I really hope ffg doesn't keep on making unnecessary "objective" or "game mechanic" versions of things, something which really cripples the customizable aspect of what is essentially a variant of the ccg, and which is becoming slowly more like a board game that gives you predetermined tools to defeat a quest. Also, it gives unnecessary complexity and stuff to "keep track about" to an already complex game. I wish they would keep it simple and make as few versions of elements as possible, especially if some of those aren't really player cards but more like "game components" like objectives and treasures.

Unless they're objects, like the Dol Guldur ones or the Gollum clues, or characters that can appear from the encounter deck but that are not essential to win the game, like Grimbeorn or the Ithilien Guardian, I normally hate objective cards. But that's just me. A Gandalf hero I wouldn't mind though.

Oddly, I would MUCH rather see Gandalf as an "objective-ally" than as a hero.  Especially if his stats are going to be reduced over his current ally versions!  I really like the feel of both current versions of him... really fits the theme of him coming and going, and showing up just at the right time in the storyline.

 

So, if I can't have a hero version of Gandalf that CLEARLY outdoes his ally versions, I'll just be happy to use him with my Sneak Attacks or pay some threat to keep him on the table...  Actually, perhaps that's the key.  We already have a version of him that can quest AND defend/attack all on the same turn, and we can keep indefinitely on the table by raising threat.  I mean, really, what would be the only advantage to having a Gandalf hero then?  The resource generation?  I can get that with another cheap hero AND have my 4/4/4/4 Gandalf ally out there creating mayhem for multiple turns...

So, my suggestion would be then to keep his stats, and giving him a huge starting threat to compensate for it, with a truly epic ability (still based on Rich's concept, which I like)... but this ability needs to be potent!  Both because... well, he's friggin Gandalf!... and also because it needs to be worth it to sacrifice someone you paid so much threat to have as a hero.

 

 

Gandalf

17 threat

4 willpower

4 attack

4 defense

4 hitpoints

 

Action:  Exhaust Gandalf to engage all enemies in play.

Action:  Discard Gandalf to discard all enemies currently engaged with you.

Or perhaps start him off with a lower threat, like 12 or 13, and include:

 

Each time Gandalf exhausts to commit to a quest, defend, or attack, the first player raises their threat by 1.

 

 

 (basically giving him the Glorfindel penalty, only more potent)

that is potent! i could see people just using thicket of spears until you have about 15 enemies, then BAM! the grey wizard kills them all.

i think he would need your second idea as well, with the threat increase for each thing he does

i wonder what gandalf the white would do- remember you have to leave room for him!

Hmmmm... hadn't thought about the ToS combo... and not to mention his ability would be even more potent in a multiplayer game.  Pulling in all the enemies from each player with his first ability, then discarding them all.  Still you would be losing your best hero (in terms of stats) to do so... perhaps an additional cost to activate the second ability:

Action: Discard Gandalf to discard any number of enemies currently engaged with you.  Raise your threat by the number of enemies discarded in this manner.  You may spread the total threat gain amongst all active players.

 

So, let's say it WAS 15 enemies.  You gain the phenomenal ability to pull them all in, discard them (or fewer of them, if you choose to), but then have to distribute 15 total threat amongst the "active" players left (in case someone had been killed off in a multiplayer game)...  (and I'm sure there would be a better way to word the whole mechanic... just was thining off the top of my head)...

Oh, he would definitely be amazing.  But I wouldn't see him having anywhere near the same "sacrifice" mechanic that a Grey version had... probably better starts and higher threat with a completely different ability/penalty...

I supose that we will follow the story of Sam and Frodo and leave anything else out. It would be strange to see Frodo fighting in Pelannor field or Isengard.

Many Saga quest related special effect cards are most likely payed via "frodo" tokens, so they don't brake any game balanse in normal gamin environment.

If the Lotr saga is following Frodo and Sam, we have:

The way to the Rivendel (including Barrow downs), From rivendel to Moria and there to Lorien and From Lorien to rauros, then Ithilien and Finally to Mordor... Hard to say how many Saga expansion we get from that. Anything from 2 to 4 are guite possible.

Hannibal, you raise an interesting point. Since Frodo will no longer be the "extra" hero as it were for some of the saga expansions, this may pave the way for Gandalf the White to take his place as the "+1" to the hero party. A new Saga only version of Aragorn may also be possible and more true to the story.

 

That is of course if they do not combine Frodo/Sam quests with quests like Pelannor Fields or Isengard in Saga Expansions.

i would be very dissapointed indeed if that happens. i agree with your point though- frodo cannot possibly be the 4th hero after the breaking, unless we follow just him.

how this would mean that we would have no need at all for the rest of the fellowship- it would be just as strange if all 9 walkers went all the way to mordor.

 

therefore it would be having at most 1 saga pack (the one after black rider) where it would make sense to use gimli, legolas and boromir, and after as for the merry and pippin, they would only really make sense in packs 1 and 2

 

i really think they shall split the packs between the 6 books as i said previously. the quests i think will be split between the groups, but that would mean changing the quest amounts in different packs

 

there are 3 in black rider, that we know

 

there can be 3 in pack 2 becuase the fellowship are together

 

pack three sees things get more complicated but i guess to simplyfy things we could see frodo and sam as 1/2 quests and the 3 hunters, merry and pippin as the other 1 or 2 quests

 

after that things get even more complicated. we have frodo and sam still, but we also have the hunters going through the paths of the dead, merry is with rohan, pippin with gondor.....

 

its complicated, but i think the designers would be doing a terrible thing if they left 50% of the tale of lotr out, which to follow frodo only they would have to do

i'm sure its been discussed at length elsewhere but i'd be surprised if they ever have Gandalf/Gandalf the White as a hero.  He'd have to be incredibly strong, stronger than his already mighty "grey" counter part but not so strong that he'd break the game.  And what sphere? colorless? He'd be in everyones deck! Using 1 sphere, 2 spheres, 3 spheres, all 4 spheres? no problem! Throw a steward of gondor on the wizard and you can pay for anything regardless of what other heroes you're using.  It would be a game designer's nightmare.  Plus all of your friends would be PO'd that either 1) they cant run their gandalf deck or 2) they cant run their gandalf allies

Well I surmise that yes, he would be rather powerful

 

His threat level would probably be up near 20 to be honest  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

Off the cuff he may well be a neutral hero. The first ever! But able to use his resources to power events from any sphere. Much like Elrond can gather allies. 

 

And as I suggested his unique name being 'Gandalf the White' would leave other players decks unmolested.

## 64 [Rapier1 on August 15, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85979-saga-expansions/?do=findComment&comment=841191)

Frodo clearly won't be the bonus hero every time it says that the saga expansions will follow other heroes and other parts of the books. (edit: I happen to hope that non-frodo/ring bearer parts however, don't get a bonus hero at all - bonus Gandalf the white might work, but I'd rather use regular Aragorn thanks all the same)

The only real question for me is; will they release everything in a linear order or will they choose another thematic order?

 

(For instance, they could release all the frodo parts first, then go back and fill in the rest, or they may approach the releases in order of the books more obviously).

I think They're definitely going to follow the books to begin with Booored so I don't think you're going to get what you want (bits exploring underused topics such as Faramir and the rangers) until some time in the future.

I think they'll eventually release everything though. I do hope we eventually get parts that have currently been missed (the old forest, barrow downs and the elves of mirkwood sections for instance).

I do however think that making only 6 saga expansions (18 quests) out of the lord of the rings would be like saying, hey lets not use all the source material and therefore make less money. It's pretty guaranteed that every saga expansion will sell.

It's just a case of asking what order they do them in, not how many. With all the side bits and bits that can inspire without directly occurring in the books, there's easily 100 + quests in the whole of the lord of the rings, and many hundreds if they get to count the appendix. 

Basically I think we'll be getting saga expansions for Lord of the Rings (and possibly one to give us the missing hobbit sections, I recon 3 more quests would complete the hobbit anyhow, it's very short), up until they get rights to a new book (Silmarilian, maybe the new children of hurin, unfinished tales perhaps).

Which isn't to say that the other expansions should cease, the deluxe expansions and original stories (especially the stewards fear; which is just made up but definitely a good story for the world) have a place in this game also. I think that adventure cycles will be phased out eventually though - as far as quest design goes I think they're much more limited in what they can do (adding only 1 additional deck to ones released in the last deluxe expansion each time I mean).

> The Saga Expansions are not meant to be "the books" or w/e. We will defiantly see some major plot lines from the books in them, but they are not going to be telling the story of the books. They are just set in the books and focus on a "part" of the book. For example The Battle of Helms Deep would make a great Saga expansion. An entire series that just tells this one battle, 6 interconnected quests. Stuff like that... or we could see a Saga Expantion on Fairimer defending Henneth Annûn for example... something only mentioned in the books.

The Saga expansions seam to be FFG trying to pull the game back towards this by allowing special rules that esist only for that expansion, allowing them to make much more interesting and thematic quests as they are not bound by the general rules of the main game.

Lol I think this is a little bit ambitious, if they could have access to this material I'm sure they would have already started delving into it.

They might get access too it if they keep making lots of money. but probably not.

I would absolutely love it, but I don't think it'll happen considering lord of the rings card games have lost a lot of their reputation being there so many.This game is amazing and all but it's hardly a revolutionary idea. The only games that i think had a real opportunity (or still have it) to reach that material are Middle-Earth ccg and LOTRO.
