For instance, can both me and my friend have 3 copies of Test of Will in our deck?  Or is 3 the limit for all decks in play?  Thanks!

(unfortunately I only have 2 core sets, so this scenario is hypothetical)

The 3 copy limit is per deck.  So in a 4 player game you could have 12 Test of Will total, 3 per deck.

Yes, even if they are unique.

You can even play multiple copies from multiple players, as long as they aren't unique.
