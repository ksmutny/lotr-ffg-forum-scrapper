Greetings!

 

Well it took a while, but I won my first game.  I am playing the pre-contructed decks right out of the box (with only 1 Gandalf).

 

Played the Tactics deck and lost four times.  Read some of the forums and realized that deck is not that good solo.

 

So, I picked Leadership.  Got beat three times before winning on my fourth.  Got Beorn's Path as my last stage of quest.   Threat was around 43.  Upon completing the quest, I looked at next card:  Ungoliant's Spawn.  That was close.  I doubt I would have recovered.

 

Now I will play Lore for a couple games and then Spirit for a couple games just to get a feel for the cards.  Then I will add the Mirkwood cards, construct a deck and start those 6 adventures.

 

Great stuff

 

Peace

 

Roger

Congrats! How can we forget those countless playthroughs of Passage through Mirkwood and Journey along the Anduin.

thanks!

 

I am going to play it more as an exercise in learning how the decks/spheres play more than winning it again.

 

I want to get a little better before creating a deck and moving to Journey Down the Anduin and Dol Guldor, which I am assuming probably cannot be won using the single sphere pre constructed deck.........

 

Peace

Nope. Well, I would say using any of the solo Core decks for Dol Guldur would win maybe 1% of the time. If you got insanely lucky with the encounter draw. Use it as an exercise in strategy and preparing for the worst the deck can throw at you.

The Anduin, though, can be beaten but it's pretty tough. Try going 2-handed solo.

## 5 [JonofPDX on February 2, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/201098-newbie-wins-first-game/?do=findComment&comment=2027021)

Gotta kind of disagree with @Network57 on this one.

 

There's absolutely nothing wrong with playing two-handed--it can be a lot of fun--but it makes the game considerably more complicated. Not a big deal if you have a good understanding of all the cards and spheres and how they all fit together but it's not ideal if your still learning. I would start constructing your own decks before you trying to play two-handed. Maybe if you're having trouble stick with the 40-card limit for a while but I wouldn't two-hand until your very confident on the structure of the game as well as how all your cards work and interact with eachother. 

 

If you are looking for a place to start deck-building with a minimal cardpool, I like Leadership/Spirit. I don't know what cards you have access to but there's a lot of synergy right out of Core between Aragorn, Eowyn and Theodred (Celbrian Stone giving Aragorn a Spirit icon and Eowyn's Ability+Stand and Fight+Steward of Gondor jumps to mind with just Core cards). 

 

And yeah--everyone's right. Don't expect to solo Dol Guldur any time soon. That's difficult even if you use the entire current cardpool. 

 

I'm glad your having fun with the game. If you have any questions swing by and ask--and update us later on how you do with the other decks and Journey Down the Anduin :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Thanks Jon..........

 

I am  using the Lore deck now and got my ass kicked the first time.  That starting threat hurt.I do like the card drawing and healing ability of the deck. 

 

Time to try again. 

 

As far as what cards I have, well, I went a little nuts and have a lot of the releases (**** rum and internet stores :lol: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_laugh.png]:blink: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_blink.png] )   Though I had planned on trying to beat the first three quests with the cards in the core set (I did augment those with some e-bay cards).  Then adding all the Mirkwood cards and hitting those 6.

 

Peace

Hey Roger, glad you're enjoying it despite getting slapped around a bit!

 

Sorry if this is below you, but I might as well put it here for anyone else who it might help:

 

I believe the designers created the core set and its quests with the following development/training for new players in mind:

 

 1. The first quest is straightforward in design, and not too difficult. Players are encouraged to just use the pre-designed 30-card single-sphere decks. The purpose is to just learn the rules, get used to the flow of the game, and start to learn the various strengths and weaknesses of the different spheres.
 2. The second quest is more difficult, and will likely require specific deck design choices in order to have a good chance of winning. This provides an opportunity for players to start experimenting with combining spheres, and crafting a deck with more particular effects and events in mind (how will I deal with the specific challenges I know are coming).
 3. Finally, the third quest is intentionally interesting and unique in its design (trapped hero mechanic, different areas with different quest card rules, etc.) in order to both let the player know that some wild variety in quest design is possible (so they can be curious about buying more quests) and the very high difficulty will also encourage players to start gathering expansions so they can expand their card pool and better face the challenges ahead.

 

So, I would recommend trying your hand at creating some 2-sphere decks from the core set in order to take on the Anduin quest, before you dive too deeply into the cycle proper.

Yes, certainly some warm feelings opening the box all those years (almost 5! back). I haven't even tried the pre-constructed decks, I was deck-building right from the start -- though very poorly, of course, mostly judging by the looks of cards but I had already felt then (and had read some forums too) that the mono-spheres won't do so well. Out of those, I think the Leadership one is probably the strongest, but the core set alone has almost enough card for a fairly decent strong deck: Théodred, Éowyn, Beravor probably being the strongest hero line-up there.

## 9 [JonofPDX on February 2, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/201098-newbie-wins-first-game/?do=findComment&comment=2028356)

Yeah—that Lore starter deck can be a tough one to crack. Out of all the Core starter decks I think it has the highest number of “under-powered” cards (though there are definitely some gems). Plus, Glorfindel is widely considered a sub-standard Hero (wow—that’s a weird sentence to type considering the other Glorfindel). Great stat line but painful threat cost and unless you build in Spirit (not a bad idea) you don’t have access to Unexpected Courage to stand him up so he can Quest and Attack. Plus his healing is super inefficient.

 

Tactics is still worse solo, but not because the cards are bad—they’re actually pretty good on average and a lot of them still get play—but they’re so focused on combat that as soon as locations start piling up they can’t recover.

 

Leadership and Spirit (in that order) are probably the best starter decks solo just because Leadership is more rounded and Spirit has great willpower, Eowyn (who is probably tied with Beravor as the best Hero in the Core Set) and the only access to Shadow and Treachery cancelation in Core.

 

Mono-Sphere in general is hard. You can make good mono-sphere decks but they are usually so focused that they will struggle in some aspect of the game. That’s fine in multi-player where, say, a Mono-Spirit deck can do all the Questing and cancellation and a Mono-Tactics deck can take on the enemies, but in solo it’s a struggle. Personally I think you have to go a fair way into the cardpool (probably Against the Shadow, at least) before mono-solo becomes really viable.

 

My advice—have fun. Build some decks when you feel ready (you will probably have to for Journey Down the Anduin). And don’t get too hung up if you can’t beat Dol Guldur—we’ve all been there. I didn’t beat it until I went back with a deck built from the whole first 2 cycles of cards!

 

The whole Mirkwwod cycle does a great job of kind of teaching you the game so expect to have to rebuild and/or tweak your deck as you go. My advice is start with the most well-rounded deck you’re comfortable with after Core and see what happens. The first AP will expand a bit on Objectives, then you’ll learn tactics for dealing with Big Bad enemies in the second AP, “this is why you should always be afraid of Treacheries” in the third, how to deal with location lock in the fourth, etc, etc, etc…by the end you should have a pretty decent all-purpose deck. Personally, I then re-ran through the Mirkwood APs and it was very satisfying to see all that hard deck-construction pay off as I put the lessons I learned into practice.

Definitely. With just core set cards alone, a TEB deck can get probably 95% success against Journey Along the Anduin, and not be troubled by any quests in the first two cycles apart from Escape from Dol Guldur, Return to Mirkwood, and Shadow and Flame. I'd recommend it for any new player (once they can grasp the tri-sphere concept) that doesn't like to constantly change their deck.

Theodred? Really? I never liked him, except with Aragorn. His ability forces him to commit to the quest to use it, but he only has 1 WP.

Celebrian stone is in sphere. So's Dunedain Quest. And Favor of the Lady's in Core as well. Plus you're figuring UC is going on Beravor for the draw and you'll need resources to play those cards.

 

And remember, you'll be questing with Eowyn every turn and probably tossing a good number of cards for that so piling up resources on Eowyn to Stand and Fight allies is great. And once you get Steward out you can start using him to attack and defend if you don't need the extra willpower. 

## 15 [Greymere on February 3, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/201098-newbie-wins-first-game/?do=findComment&comment=2029222)

Using just a Core set with only one sphere is a pretty significant handicap, Spirit and Lore really lack for good attack options outside of Gandalf.  Tactics suffers for questing.  Leadership performs moderately well if you can manage to reduce your threat early enough with a Gandalf/Sneak Attack since it had good resource generation decent questing and the ability to ready Aragorn.

Great post!  Thanks!

 

I am having fun.  Lore deck got its ass kicked again, but I am just getting the nuances of the spheres down.  For the most part, I plan on dual decks.  I was always a dual color Magic guy.

 

Peace

Bi-sphere is definitely the standard so you should be able to find a lot of examples if you need inspiration.

Gotta say that in my earliest Anduin days tri sphere was the only thing to get me through Anduin and I think it was this combo

OK I cannot take the Lore deck any longer :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]  I had better luck with Tactics.

 

Time to play some with the Spirit deck to see what it is all about and get to deck designing....

Lore deck I used least once I passed Anduin, yet there's a certain Mirkwood quest it's truly essential for.

Then I had a khazad dum cycle quest that core denethor was essential for, so its great the game makes you use cards you aren't used to at times :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Cool. 

 

Core Spirit has some amazing cards but it's seriously lacking in combat so you may have to get creative to deal with enemies. Pushing through the quest as quick as possible and keeping your threat low (while sniping some enemies with Dunhere) is probably your best bet. Remember Eowyn's ability--1 extra willpower might not seem like much but it adds up. And if you can ditch an ally while you have Stand and Fight in your hand, you can still bring them back onto the board later. Unexpected Courage is one of the best cards in the game but in the Core Spirit deck it doesn't have any super fantastic targets...Eleanor's probably your best bet. 

 

Hope you have fun and let us know how you do.

The only reason I will use Spirit is to see how the deck plays out. 

 

I think I will do a leadership/lore or leadership/spirit deck first.

 

Though the combat of tactics seems cool too.

 

Like everyone has said, great game.  I can see where you would need to use all spheres at certain times....

You are right about needing all spheres. Sometimes I have played tri sphere tactics/spirit/leadership with a splash of borrowed lore, others I have run tactics/spirit/lore with a splash of leadership as I have wanted cards from all spheres. Just need to be careful with resources

Gonna beat Pasage Though Mirkwood with Spirit, did not take that long........  trouble is not a lot of ways to do damage.  Will have to address that.

 

So now gonna build a Spirit/Leadership deck and have at "Journey....."

Hi

 

Well, a Leadership/Spirit deck I built (my first) did not fare well.  Basically I took almost all of the Leadership cards in Core (along with some other core cards I picked up) and about 16 low cost Spirit cards to formulate my deck.  I used Aragorn, Theodred and Eowyn as heroes.  Does well placing progress tokens, but I just cannot do anything about the Hill troll. 

 

I keep hoping to get Gandalf out and a couple of times and then shuffling my deck.  To no avail so far. 

 

Thinking of swapping out the Spirit cards for some tactics just to see how it goes.

 

Getting pretty obsessed with it now :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

It could worth checking out Beorn's path at the Hall of Beorn blog 

 

https://hallofbeorn.wordpress.com/beorns-path/  [https://hallofbeorn.wordpress.com/beorns-path/%C2%A0]

 

I used this resource when I started out, and I found it very helpful.

Basically he goes through constructing a deck using just core set cards to beat the core set quests. He even goes on to challenge the mirkwood cycle quests using only player cards that were available at their time of release.

from memory I think he uses a Lore/Leadership deck to take on Journey down the Anduin. The idea being to forest snare the hill troll.

 

Happy gaming!

Hi,

 

I picked this game up last September, but did not play much.

About a week ago I started again, challenging myself to get at last the basic quests done, as I was stuck at the Anduin Quest back in September. 

 

After a couple of runs through the Mirkwood I started modifying Decks. Lore/Leadership was quite fine, and then stumbling upon Beorns Path I realized that my Deck was quiet similar to the one suggested for the Anduin. So I took my Deck to the Anduin and was finally able to beat it. This was a great experience.

 

Then I started constructing a Tactics/Spirit Deck to deal with the weaknesses of my other Deck and took these Decks to Dol Guldur. After starting a few times over after a bad starting position I was able to beat even this quest, with just one core. 

 

Now I really start to love this game.  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

It has quite a learning curve, but than being able to beat it feels really rewarding.

 

...

 

This lead to picking up another Core Set, most of the first two cycles and the Hobbit expansions on ebay... Sometimes I get a little bit mad, post-Arkham-trauma or something  ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

 

Have fun

 

Matthias

I also have been trying not to dig into my other cards.  I want to complete at least the first two quests with core.

 

We shall see, might cave in though and crack open the Mirkwood stuff.

## 34 [rdw5150 on February 23, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/201098-newbie-wins-first-game/?do=findComment&comment=2066314)

Leadership and Tactics take out Anduin after three times.......

 

In my best game so far, the Leadership/Tactics deck with:  Aragorn/Theodred/Thalin took out Andurin quest.

 

The Hill troll took out numerous allies and heroes.  In then end Thalin with his dwarven axe, being knighted with Sterwart of Gondor earlier, draws For Gondor to do the last two damage to the Hill Troll as the Guard of the Citadel dies defending Thalin (who was one damage away from dying).  Threat=45

 

No Gandalfs drawn.

 

Does not get closer than that.....

 

WOW

 

Highlighted by the happy hour drinks had before heading to Man Cave. :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]:lol: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_laugh.png]

 

 

Now the decision:  Go ahead with Dol Guldor or start with Mirkwood adventures to build up cards......

 

Peace

Hey Roger, I've got a couple of questions regarding your battle report.

 

Firstly, were you able to complete the second 2 quest stages with just Thalin? As you must defeat the Hill Troll before you can move past the first quest stage.

 

Second, I assume you mean that you drew For Gondor which allowed you to defeat the troll. How did you pay for this if the only hero you had left was Thalin? Or did you have another hero left?

 

Not trying to put a damper on your play experience, just trying to wrap my head around it.

## 36 [rdw5150 on February 23, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/201098-newbie-wins-first-game/?do=findComment&comment=2066345)

ah you did dampen my experience :lol: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_laugh.png]   You are right, Aragorn was still alive (one HP left).   My bad...... I was caught up in the narrative of Aragorn allowing For Gondor to be played and Guardian of the Citadel dying saving Thalin...........

 

Though clearly I played the quest wrong.  I thought the Hill Troll had to be killed by the end of the quest itself (not just part one)....... .....  Even though looking at the damned card it is even in BOLD.  WTF

 

SNIFF

Congrats on winning your first quest. I have very fond memories of winning against Mirkwood when I first bought the core set when it came out years ago. It's a great game though I haven't played since last year. I did however just pick up a second core set box loaded with cards from several expansions for $20 at a local used book store. Maybe I'll play again soon. Happy questing!

I have been tossing around the idea of a 2nd Core.  Once Black Riders is back in print, I will want to start the Saga campaign.  I will not want to keep re-building decks as I switch between the two style (Questing and Campaigning).

man screw that frickin' Hill Troll.

 

Gotta be honest, this is  getting frustrating.

 

20 games in and I cannot beat Anduin quest.  Nothing beats the Hill Troll.  10 games with leadership/spirit and 10 games with leadership/tactic and I cannot beat the Hill troll and that alone is stopping me.  At times I have had over 20 progress tokens on the first stage to no avail.

 

Does not help that card draws has seen me see Gandalf a total of 3 times in 20 games (before all heroes die).

 

I have been fighting doing Lore just to get that one dang card to stop the Hill Troll from killing everyone.......  just seems like one should be able to beat the quest with more than one strategy......

 

GRRRRRRRR  WTF

Quick Strike to attack the troll before it attacks you.

Lore: Let the Troll attack a cheap ally (Henamath, Miner, Hammersmith, Gleowine) and next round attach a forest snare to him.

Tactic: Defend first attack with Gimli (risky) and if Gimli does not die - attach Dwarven Axes to Gimli & Legolas, Feint the Troll next time an attack him with Gimli and Legolas

Leadership. Tricky .. Sneak attack Gandalf one or two times (or play him) before the troll attacks .. defend with Aragorn or Gandalf and attack back.

Spriit: Avoid beeing engaged from the Troll .. but nothing will kill the troll.

 

Prefer a mix from two spheres .. perhaps tactics/leadership (Aragorn, Gimli, Theodred) so you are able to sneak attack Gandalf and ready fully loaded Gimli by common cause if needed :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

> Quick Strike to attack the troll before it attacks you.

 

Got three of them in the deck too.  I have seen that four times total (in 20 games) as well.

 

mathematically, very  odd...

 

I thought with 3 gandalf, 3 quick strike and 3 sneak attack, I'd be able to take that SOB out at least once :rolleyes: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_rolleyes.gif]:blink: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_blink.png]:P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

Been using Leadership/Tactics with Aragorn, Theodred and Thalin.  I have three Dwarven axes in there so, that has been the only way I can damage the troll, 1 damage at a time (except for the very occasional Quick Strike and Gandalf).  I stayed away from Gimli, as I did not want to take the Threat hit.  But I am re-thinking that now.......

 

OK, enough whining that thing must die :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

I have to say that I did find this quest one of the most frustrating please don't lose heart the rest of the game isn't like this (except dol guldur which is just silly) take heart and keep faith

Beorn's Path really does have good advice for this one

Oh I will not give up, it must happen now :lol: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_laugh.png]

 

I have been trying not to read threads on specific quests.  I'd like to beat them on my own (more or less, some advise is usually welcome).  Though I will read threads on deck construction. 

## 49 [rdw5150 on February 25, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/201098-newbie-wins-first-game/?do=findComment&comment=2070635)

> Don't do Dol Guldur.
>

From what I have read, I will wait until I have more cards.  I plan on adding new cards a "block" at a time.  I do not think that will break things (for example I will add all the Mirkwood cards when I start the Mirkwood quests).

## 50 [DurinIII on February 25, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/201098-newbie-wins-first-game/?do=findComment&comment=2070881)

The simplest way to deal with the Hill Troll with core set cards is to throw a forest snare on him.

How closely are you keeping an eye on your threat? If you are forced to engage him too early, you're screwed.

 

I would focus on questing well, reducing threat if needed, and overall try to build yourself up before unleashing the attacks. By the time you hit 30 threat hopefully you'll have a bunch of chump blockers to buy yourself some time, or will have Gimli loaded up with gear and well prepped, or just have enough items and allies in play to withstand the troll for a while, or at the very least have the snare by then.

 

This may require adjusting the heroes you are using, or making your deck more consistent, etc.

When you need specific cards from your deck quickly, card draw is your friend :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Also, a tiny advice of something I overlooked :

(How do I add a spoiler tab here? Edit: aha done it!) 

Hill Troll hits you for a big whack the turn he engages even before you get a chance to play forest snare because he engages AFTER your window to play the card... but check out the card ability on son of arnor  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

The way I do Anduin now is much different than how I did it when I started the game.

 

Spoilers:

Eowyn, Theodred, Beravor. Draw every turn with Beravor. Use 3x Gandalf, 2x Galadrim's Greeting to make sure you never go above 30 threat. Eventually you've drawn all your cards and have a ton of resources. You play out all the allies in your deck. Then you engage the Hill Troll, kill him the same turn, advance to stage 2, and quest through all of stage 2 in one go on the next turn, and finish.

 

It might seem boring, but following this will make it virtually impossible to lose. You can even rig the encounter deck to have terrible setups, like an East Bight during setup and a Brown Lands on the first turn, and not allow yourself any mulligans, and still pull out a win.

I am using Aragorn, Theodred and Thalin.  So starting threat 29.   So pretty high, but not certain how much lower I can get it.  I quest fine.  Its damaging the Troll.  I have come cannon fodder to sacrifice to the Hill Troll.   I drew an early Gandalf last game, but rest of hand was high cost allies (do not even have that many) which meant I still could not hold off the hordes. :blink: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_blink.png]

What do you sleep with these cards under your pillow :lol: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_laugh.png]

 

Been checking out some of your videos.  Impressive stuff.  Though I have a ton of the releases, I have not cracked any other open as I want to keep the cards available somewhat within reason.  IOW I am just using core, and once I move on to Mirkwood, I will use the cards from those 6 releases.

WOO HOO!

 

After about 25 tries (tword the end I knew if I had a chance pretty after about 5 draws), I finally beat Anduin with Leadership/Tactics.

 

A Sneak Attack/Gandalf combo on initial draw got me off to a great start against the Hill Troll.  A run of Treachery cards and little or no monsters allowed me to place lots of  progress token in the mid game.

 

I was worried at end game when another Hill Troll reared his ugly head.  But Thalin gave his life defending Aragorn who was able to kill off the Hill Troll and bring victory.

 

ahhhhhhh I feel better now.

 

I doubt I will try Dol Guldur as from what I read it is hard out of the box.

 

I think I will break the seal on the 6 Mirkwood packs, check out the cards and tackle that run of quests.

Congrats!

 

And welcome to the game proper as things really expand as you leave Core. Now what you have to decide is how to handle your cardpool and deck construction going forward.

 

Some people like to open each pack as you play them, adding just a few player cards at a time to your cardpool so you can really get a feel for them as you play each quest. Other people like to open the whole cycle at once and add a large block of player cards all at once to your cardpool--something that can be more confusing at first but also allows you a better bird's eye view of the synergies and viable combos that developed during the cycle. 

 

Personally, I prefer the latter option but both are very valid.

Hehe i prefered one pack at a time. Not only did it make it more managable for me, but also pushed me to try some cards i may not otherwise have tried. Also, sometimes the card pack had some synergy with the included quest, so i liked that better too.

For me, i prefered the Mirkwood cycle to Dwarrowdelf that I just finished. Great memories of Mirkwood!

I am torn.....Part of me wants to open all 6 Mirkwood packs at once and use those cards for the Mirkwood run of adventures.

 

Part me me wants to just open them one at a time.

So, I am thinking of buying a 2nd Core......  I have Black Riders on the way to me.  I am thinking if I had a 2nd Core, I could be playing  Mirkwood and Black Riders at the same time, swapping back and fourth and not have to tear apart decks.......

 

I guess I could use two spheres for each project.......

> So, I am thinking of buying a 2nd Core......  I have Black Riders on the way to me.  I am thinking if I had a 2nd Core, I could be playing  Mirkwood and Black Riders at the same time, swapping back and fourth and not have to tear apart decks.......

Lord of the Rings has terrible Core Set distribution. For a normal player, there's waste in even a single additional Core and it gets ridiculous with three Cores. I understand why they couldn't do a full playset of cards in the Core but they should have stuck to Singles so that we could buy 3 without waste...

 

For you, as you want to run multiple cardpools so you don't have to break down decks, it does make a little more sense to have multiple Cores...but I still think just breaking down decks or using a different sphere would be a better option. Still, there are benefits to be had and an extra Steward, Sneak Attack, Unexpected Courage or Northern Tracker are all very nice so if money isn't an issue...

I struggle to justify a third core but one day would like the full playset.

Thing is, the core x1 cards cost about £20 posted from eBay yet a full core Inc free postage is £25 so the x1 set isnt worth it you might as well get a full core with uggins of spares.

I already have so many spares from my second core.

Full playset be nice though.
