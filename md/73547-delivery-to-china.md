Slightly random question, but does anyone have any experience of getting FFG products delivered to China?

there's a vague possibility of needing to move there with work, and I was wondering whether anyone had either ordered from FFG directly, or from a webstore, and had stuff arrive safely at a Chinese addresss? - I know other people who've had customs issues with packages needing to be albelled in chinese saying what their contents are, and can see potential issues there…

 I do not have any specific info but I've hard that many people use bookdepository to order LCG's outside US. Their price includes worldwide shipping - javascript:void(0);/*1351684295683*/ [http://www.bookdepository.com/search?searchTerm=lord+of+the+rings+lcg&search=search]

 I often use bookdepository to order my packs.

 

It has one disadvantage: it usually has the products 1, 1/2 month later.

 

I had absolutely NO problems with their shippings and they arrived in 10 days max. I'm from Portugal.

 

And it is much cheaper than ordering from FFG website

 I'm from Italy. I always purchase FFG stuff from bookdepository (which in my experience gets the items after 7 days from their official release date). As for shipping, I usually get my order within 5 working days…
