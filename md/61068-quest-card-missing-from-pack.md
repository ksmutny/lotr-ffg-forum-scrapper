Went to my LGS today and bought the Conflict at Carrock.  When I got home, I discovered it was missing the 3rd quest card.  My LGS says I have to contact the manufacturer.  Anyone know who I should talk to?

Thanks!

And don't be worried when you buy The Hills of Emyn Muil...it only has one quest card.

Yes but at least the hills of Emyn Muil tell you you win when you complete it.

the difference between CoC  and emyn is that emyn was intentional, but im pretty sure CoC was a mistake as it was FAQed
