Hey guys. I'm a new LOTR play. Been playing CoC and Invasion prior to this. 

Just a couple questions/clarifications.

 

1. If you buy more than one core set to play 3-4 players do you need to add ALL the copies of the quest specific cards for the encounter deck or just one core set worth?

 

*One seems like you'd sometimes run out of cards in a 4 player game even if you're reshuffling the encounter discard pile.

 

2. What are your thoughts on reading encounter cards for quests before you even play the quest? Think it's best to be surprised or well prepared?

 

Thanks so much for your time! Cheers!

1.) Just one set, reshuffling the deck will keep the encounter deck full.

 

2.) I personally don't read the encounter cards before beginning a new quest but that can get frustrating, there's definitely some treachery/encounter cards that can just wipe the game but I find struggling through those tough quests the most enjoyable. I recommend playing through the quest first, if you defeat it then hooray, otherwise everyone can have a few minutes to mod their deck based on the loss and what they saw. Like you are scouting out the battle, then begin again!

The multiplayer scaling comes largely from turning down more cards during the staging.  Those cards will often synergize and cause more trouble than all of them individually.  BTW, a higher number of cards in the encounter deck generally makes the quest easier.  Rapidly recycling nasty cards when the encounter deck runs out amps up the difficulty quite a bit.

 

As for investigating the quest before attempting - it depends on you.  I tend to skim them because I don't usually have enough time to bang my head against brick walls needlessly.  I don't feel like I need to know everything, but I don't want to take a willpower-heavy deck into a tough combat scenario and waste time modding my deck on the spot.

 

Enjoy the game!

Right on! Thank you for your quick reply, KennedyHawk!

 

I kinda figured going through the quest blind once would be a good way to "scout" as you said but it definitely could kick your ass in a way you'd never expect. Adds a level of uncertainty which seems to be more...realistic.

 Never thought of that! Good thinking.

I never read the encounter cards prior to playing a new scenario. I enjoy the mystery of not knowing what could be revealed. Furthermore, once I have lost a game, I still do not go and read all of the encounter cards. I keep playing it until I have seen nearly all of the cards. 

 

In my mind, I get the most value and insight out of playing a new scenario blind, and learning about it as I go. It can help you pick up on weak spots in your decks, and also provides surprise and mystery.

Good question. I usually play a new quest using a deck I am favouring at the moment. As I am not building a deck for the quest I run the quest blind. Then latter when I tweak my deck with the quest in mind I open it in the deck editor so I am able to go though the cards and have a strong understanding of the quest.

Your last words made me go listen to Hugh Laurie's "Mystery" for the millionth time. Excellent song.

 

I do usually read through the encounter cards before playing through the scenario if it is rated at a high difficulty level. I want to know in advance what I'm about to be mauled by.

 

Welcome to the game, Dr Nocturne!

Welcome to the game, I hope you enjoy it!

 

As for your second question:

 

> 2. What are your thoughts on reading encounter cards for quests before you even play the quest? Think it's best to be surprised or well prepared?

 

For me it is part of my ritual to neither look at quest cards nor at encounter prior to first 2-3 times I play the quest. Usually after playing them several times you know the deck pretty well, already. I do adapt my deck in between, so usually I end up with a pretty "specialised" deck for the later run-throughs. And often I do then try and analyze the encounter deck.

Thank you all for the great replies and advice!

 

After trying a few more quests "blind", and then getting my ass kicked early or grinding through it, it's pretty clear that it is more enjoyable to not read ahead.
