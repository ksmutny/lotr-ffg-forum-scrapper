I have come to conclusion that in solo games, you are cheating yourself badly if you do not play Spirit (Particularly Eowyn). I am tired of building cool thematic decks that only let me down substantially in the quest phase because I haven't added Rohan and that damned Sister-daughter of Theodin.  Any other solo players feel my pain?

Don't get me wrong, I LOVE this game, but I want another good questing option outside of Eowyn!  If I want to win consistently, I play Eowyn. If I want to have fun tricking out different themes outside of Rohan, well, I usually always lose.

Have you considered running Glorfindel ? (Lore, with 3 WP) and pumping with  Celebrian's stone (Leadership) for an extra 2 WP. Also you can run Protecor of Lorien on him too :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Yeah, I have consider Glorfindel.  In fact I am about to experiment with him in a deck pretty soon.  I do hope that in the future though they give tactics a character with 3 or 4 Willpower...same with Leadership; these two spheres need Willpower help.

Look on my Glorifindel art deck for solo play.

There is no Eowyn no Northern  Trackers but play very well against almost all quests (except Dol-Guldor).

I built and played with Glaurung's deck when he first posted it. I liked it and thought that it worked really well. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 I've had some moderate success with an elf-themed deck using Bilbo, Glorfindel, & Legolas. 

I haven't tried it against any of the 6 difficulty or higher quests.

I'm sure that it could actually tuned into a much stronger deck, but I've only got a single core set and I'm trying to have four prepared player decks on hand (so only one copy of Gandalf in each). I also made this deck last so it got a bit of the short straw when it comes to certain events.
