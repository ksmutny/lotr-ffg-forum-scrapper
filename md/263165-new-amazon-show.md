Amazon has announced it will produce a multi-season prequel show to Lord of the Rings.

 

 

What have we done to deserve this punishment lol

It's noteworthy that the TV series will be set in the time period between the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings, just like our beloved game. I don't see how this can be anything but good news for the longevity of the LotR LCG.

I'm excited.

It doesn't have to be awful.  Have they announced Tauriel's triumphant return?

While there's life there's hope, and need of vittles.

I'm not terribly optimistic, but I'll probably give it a shot. Modern adaptations of Tolkien tend to miss the things that I like most about his writings, while focusing on the things I'm not too keen on. But we shall see, I suppose.

Hmm, let's wait and see. Especially after the hobbit movies my initial reaction is skepticism to any adaptation of Tolkien's work. This game has been a wonderful exception because they work hard to stay consistent with the original works.

Same for me. I hope that this is good, but I am expecting it to be bad. Thank goodness it's not the Silmarillion though. I'm very doubtful that could ever be any good, except as the book. But I'm a sceptic.

Me too!  While there certainly is the potential for it to be a stinker, I am hopeful that they can find a way to be somewhat cosistent with the lore and tone of the books, but still have enough modern sensibilities (action and drama) to appeal to a large  enough audience for it to be successful.  A fine line to walk for sure....

I’ll need Peter Jackson, Andy Serkis, Alan Lee, and John Howe (at minimum) to be involved and then I can get really excited. I’d also prefer no cameos from other Hobbit/LOTR actors, because I think this would work better not as “universe” kind of thing.

I feel like if they have the full rights they really should make LOTR/Hobbit cast the central characters. Why ever not? We want to see the familiar and important characters. I would be pretty unhappy if one of the main story lines doesn't feature young Aragorn's enormous, 67-year character arc (this would seem like the most obvious choice for a TV series).

Disagree. I love the LOTR movies (though I probably will never watch the hobbit films again), but I like a more “realistic”, dark age aesthetic. Cf The One Ring rpg. 

Howe and Lee’s art is good, but I hope to see something different and fresh on this series. The Vikings show could be a good reference — stylish but period appropriate costumes with modern sensibilities.

I can think of several stories I'd like to see, even just of what we know took place in that time period:

-Aragorn's travels abroad

-Balin's attempt to retake Moria

-Saruman's forays into Ring-making

-Beorn becoming a great leader of the woodmen along the Anduin

...and that's not even getting into brand new tales they could tell!

If you're interested in computer games at all, I'd recommend Lord of the Rings Online.  They do a pretty good job of expanding on the goings-on during LotR while digging through the text to try to be as true as they can (most of the deviations tend to be ones of scale, so that it doesn't literally take two weeks to get to Rivendell, or ones for dramatic effect, such as making the Stone of Erech a bit larger so that it looks more impressive).

@JJ48: Thanks for the tip. Unfortunately with work and kids at the home time for computer gaming is a remote possibility at best.

I can second LOTRO. Gameplay gets pretty grindy, even though they've made combat as interesting as possible, but the stories are really good if you take the time to read the quest.

We haven't heard anything to suggest that there is any connection or that FFG has any rights related to the new show.  (That I know of.)

The other fear of course is that with Amazon involved FFG might lose licensing depending on how demanding they are with the Tolkein estate.

Unless I miss my guess, FFG's current licensing, like everyone else's prior to this new development, was *not* with the Tolkien Estate at all.

Interesting, I had thought everyone had to go through the Tolkein estate.  Who else would be able to grant rights?

Edited to add:

It looks like FFG's license is with Middle Earth Enterprises which is the entity the Tolkein estate uses to provide LOTR rights to third-parties.  So, you're right it's not a direct contract with the Tolkein estate.

*Tolkien

But no, this isn't correct. The Tolkien Estate does not "use" Middle-earth Enterprises (MeE) to provide rights to their parties. Long ago J.R.R. sold the movie and merchandising rights for The Hobbit and LOTR, which were in turn sold to what is now MeE. The Tolkien Estate has no more ability to provide those rights to anyone - it's up to MeE.

The TV rights, on the other hand, were not sold by J.R.R., and have just been acquired by Amazon from the Tolkien Estate for the first time. That's why this is such a big deal.

It was a (poor) joke based on the likeness of the alt-art Galadriel to Scarlett Johansson.

I like Sir Ian McKellen as Gandalf, but I personally hope they don't use actors from the films.  The series sounds like they'll be going their own route with the adaptation, and having the same actors, especially if they play the same role, could distract from that.

If they did want to have any of the film actors in there, just use them for a minor role, as an Easter Egg.

I'm not familiar with any current Amazon series, so I don't know how true they'll try to stay to Tolkien; but I figure if they do a good job then we have a good series to watch, and if they do a poor job then we have a good series to riff. Win/win! (Just so long as they don't do anything truly offensive, such as having an army leap over the heads of a spear-wall to interpose themselves between its spears and a charging horde!  In all honesty, I was quite enjoying the Hobbit movies up until that point.)

Your use of "truly offensive" make me feel really weird. It would suppose that your identity is questioned by this thing. It bother me even more since there is offensive things in the LOTR shows (like: having all color people, and only color people, being part of the evil empire).

The Mouth of Sauron was a Black Numenorean.  And since the part of Middle-Earth that we're dealing with is supposed to be Europe, what other ethnicities should there be, apart from the armies that are coming from far away to heed Sauron's call? 

Also, didn't Lake-town have some darker folks in it, which makes a little sense, given the town's focus on trade, I guess.

It's true that modern use of the word "offensive" tends to focus on personal offense, but there are other uses. For instance, if something smells bad, you might say it "offends the senses". I think in this case the use of the word offensive was intended to be interpreted a little more abstractly.

The mout of Sauron is black. Yes. It was a choice and I question the reason behind the choice. Or, because there is no point finding if someone is racist or not, I want to argue that describing a world like that is not neutral and is a bad choice that we could avoid.

There is, and always were, a lot of non white people in Europe. There could be people who come to fight Sauron (people like the ones we help in cycle 7), there could be black and white people in both part of this world, because it is how the world work. It will be both more logical and more ethical. I'm glad that our devs fix that, even if it is only a little bit.

The Mouth of Sauron was described as a Black Numenorean -- the Black referring not to skin color, but allegience to Sauron.  There's no reason from the text to think his skin color was necessarily black, nor is he depicted as dark-skinned in Jackson's extended cut.  If there's something controversial about Jackson's portrayal, it's having Aragorn chop his head off, contrary to the text.

"White people" is a bit of a nebulous concept, even apart from the fact that no one but albinos are truly white, and the exact threshold of melanin required to cross the threshold into "non-white" is not well-defined.  With that said, there's no hint in the text of racial diversity, in the modern sense, among the free humans we meet in the text -- nor any reason we should expect it among an ancient and homogenous society.  However, the appendixes make clear that Ecthelion, father of Denethor, welcomed talented outsiders to his service from any background (such as Thoringil/Aragorn), so that certainly presents the possibility of "non-white" humans laboring against Sauron -- however, that's a previous generation and only the long-lived Thorongil makes a contribution in our time frame.

With the violence Jackson performed to the text during his movies, I can see that expecting him to take further liberties in the service of providing a diversity of skin not suggested by the text isn't inherently unreasonable -- but I can't just find it offensive when a filmmaker *fails* to take liberties with the text.  The diversity in the Free Peoples of the text is between *actually different* races, not just marginally different shades of humans.  Making the movies make a point of the latter would come at the expense of the former.

Yes, we have good Haradrim in the LCG, but that's because our heroes are actually in Harad at the time.  Why should they travel to Gondor or Rohan to fight Sauron when they're already busy fighting Sauron in their own lands?  (Not to mention, past grievances between the Haradrim and Gondor could lead to more than a little mistrust on both sides).

There's nothing wrong with diversity, but I personally think that trying to force diversity when it wouldn't make sense isn't necessarily a great solution.  I mean, suppose we were making a movie about the Mongols invading China.  Would you insist that we absolutely had to cast people of European or African descent just so the movie would be more diverse?

## 43 [Authraw on February 3, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/263165-new-amazon-show/?do=findComment&comment=3197702)

The topic of race in The Lord of the Rings is a really deep one--one of these days I should do an essay or two on it for my blog.

But for the time being, I wanted to point out that when topics like this come up there are usually two different contexts that people use to analyze it:

 1. The narrative as it stands on its own, including in-universe reasons for why things are the way they are
 2. The work in the context of the greater world of fiction, where the work is one of many works that we interact with as we consume media

People often try to apply statements made in one context to the other context, which can lead to miscommunication and confusion.

In context 1, when considering the work on its own, it makes sense that The Lord of the Rings would focus on a very particular set of people (that is, white people).

In context 2, when we consider the great number of prominent works focusing on white people, as well as the real-world historical and current context of race relations, we can lament that this story (which we know well and love) neither challenges pernicious ideas about race, nor increases the representation of people of color.

There's lots more to dig into here, but it'll take more time and energy than I think I can put into a forum post. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I guess this is what I disagree with, the idea that every story needs to have such a moral, and that it's regrettable if it doesn't.  Not every story (even of those which have a moral) can have every moral, and trying to simply force a moral into a story that wasn't meant for it usually just  comes across as awkward and ham-fisted.  

Again, diversity can be good, but diversity simply for the sake of diversity is neutral at best, and bad if one does violence to the story just to make it fit.

I don't regret that the story doesn't increase "the representation of people of color".  He couldn't do that without materially changing the nature of the society he was writing about, and altering his writing for the purpose of promoting a particular moral message would be anathema to Tolkien himself (despite his friendship with C.S. Lewis, he was no fan of allegories).

However, I *do* think the story very much challenges pernicious ideas about race, given a world with *multiple* intelligent peoples, not just one like our own.  The prejudices and suspicions between nations and peoples are shown to serve the Enemy, while the cooperation between them helped bring him down.  Nothing in our world is as truly multicultural as the Fellowship of the Ring.

Here's what Tolkien himself said in the foreword:

"The Lord of the Rings has been read by many people since it finally appeared in print; and I should like to say something here with reference to the many opinions or guesses that I have received or have read concerning the motives and meaning of the tale.  The prime motive was the desire of a tale-teller to try his hand at a really long story that would hold the attention of readers, amuse them, delight them, and at times maybe excite them or deeply move them....

As for any inner meaning or 'message', it has in the intention of the author none.... I cordially dislike allegory in all its manifestations, and always have done so since I grew old and wary enough to detect its presence.  I much prefer history, true or feigned, with its varied applicability to the thought and experience of readers.  I think that many confuse 'applicability' with 'allegory'; but the one resides in the freedom of the reader, and the other in the purposed domination of the author."

It is certainly true that a work of fiction need not be an allegory to have a 'message' -- it is equally true that for any moral message you could name, there are more works written to promote it than I could possibly read in my remaining lifetime.  LOTR is by design not meant to convey any particular message, and though it does move me and I find much 'applicability' within its pages, I do not think that is or should be a reasonable expectation for great works of fiction.  Dumas' The Three Musketeers is certainly a feigned history, but I've been unable to detect any moral message in it that I approve -- but it's a thumping good read all the same, and that by itself is enough to justify its existence, IMO.  I don't share Tolkien's disdain for allegories, but I certainly find that writing, like games, frequently suffers when the message is more important to the creator than the story.

I now have approximately four separate tangents I'm itching to go down; as I said, race in LotR is a deep subject. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] But instead of muddying the waters here, I'll focus on clarifying my original assertion.

Treating diversity as a moral that a story may or may not choose to center is still looking at the work through context 1--the context of the work by itself. In the context of any individual work, it may have some moral it's trying to pursue, or it may not. If Tolkien had wanted to write a story about "racial diversity", we would have gotten a completely different story. But that's not what he chose to write about--he wanted to tell a fantasy story based on European histories and legends. And that's great! When you look at the work on its own, there's really no problem here.

A problem only arises when you pull back the focus and look at the stories we tend to tell (and retell) as a society. You begin to notice trends--like the fact that people of color rarely appear as protagonists, but when they do appear it's frequently as antagonists. (This trend has been slowly getting better, by the way, which I would argue is the result of creators being aware of and intentionally trying to counteract the trend... but of course that's a tangent). No one of these stories we tell may necessarily be problematic on its own, but when you look at all of them together they form an uncomfortable picture about how we as a society tend to interact with race.

But this, of course, makes the problem difficult to talk about, because it means that any given work can be both part of a problematic system of thought and completely fine on its own.

From this point, there are lots of places you can go with the conversation. What are the responsibilities of content creators relative to the larger social systems with which they interact? What are the responsibilities of consumers of media? I have my own perspectives on these sorts of questions but I think the answers to them are far from settled.

Like I said, there's a lot to discuss here; I just want to make sure we're all having the same conversation.

I suppose I would disagree with the idea that the author bears any of the responsibility.  The author has a story to tell; let it stand or fall on its own merit.  If part of that story is to interact with social norms in some way, that's fine, but it is grossly unfair to authors and their works to fault them simply because the author didn't concern himself with sociology.

What's the use of all the arguing?

Racism is wrong. Tolkien was not a racist. The Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit, The Silmarillion, and the rest of Tolkien's works aren't great because they didn't support racism. They're great because they're good books. These are all cold, hard facts.

Amazon will probably not stay true to Tolkien's vision of Middle Earth, but then neither did PJ with the horrendous Hobbit trilogy. Either way, no need for an argument, however civilized. On a lighter note, what are the odds the new series will follow the events of our beloved game, or that some of the future cycles might be based off of whatever Amazon cooks up?

## 51 [shoreless on February 5, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/263165-new-amazon-show/?do=findComment&comment=3200211)

Adapting Middle-earth for a contemporary audience can be done in a representative way, racially speaking, that does not diminish the original work at all. The inclusion of people of varying levels of melanin in Esgaroth as part of the third (second? They all bleed together in nightmarish fashion) Hobbit film is a good example. Lake-town was a trade hub, so it follows that folks from all over the east and south would end up there. I also would have no problem seeing dark-skinned Gondorians (or dwarves for that matter). 

This kind of thing didn't really become important to me until I got super into Deep Space 9. Avery Brooks went out of his way to say in interviews that part of the reason he did Star Trek (besides the monetary benefits) was to show little brown-skinned kids that they can be captains, too. This can be a part of LOTR without "breaking" canon. People also often overlook that there are literally different peoples (species) represented in these stories, even if they all seem to have European heritage.

Anyways, I have no idea how we wound up here but I think Wandalf is on to something. New cycles, guys?

I think the effect described in the first paragraph is not necessarily about race specifically, and more about ethnocentrism.  In historical English literature, Frenchmen rarely appear as protagonists, but when they do appear it's frequently as antagonists.  In France I suspect the reverse is true.  I've read folk tale collections from many different countries, and the protagonists are overwhelmingly from the countries in question, while people/creatures from outside the originating culture appear frequently as antagonists.  Even in the artificial worlds of SF&F, humans are overwhelmingly protagonists and when non-humans do appear it's frequently as antagonists.  I would argue that neither content creators nor content consumers have a responsibility to undo this situation, merely to create what they wish and consume what they want.  Creation is too hard, and life is to short, to do otherwise--and the common situation also allows works that go against the ethnocentric grain to stand out, and be selected by those it appeals to.

At the same time, I certainly think that it's true that harmful racial stereotypes (and for that matter, non-racial stereotypes) can propagate through creative works, and both creators and consumers should be wary of them.  Certainly any works created for the purpose of demonizing a particular ethnic group should be strictly avoided.

What about a derivative work set in a particular (fictional) setting?  Do the creators have a responsibility to faithfully reproduce the setting of the original work?  Obviously Peter Jackson felt the answer was no, and if I were to lay a bet on this new show I'd bet against it as well.  Should the creators feel obligated to produce a diverse set of heroes to better reflect the demographics of their target audience than the demographics of Middle Earth?  Of course not, IMO.  But if they did, would it be a disaster?  No way to tell.  If Kahliel were borrowed from FFG and made a major character, with his backstory as a plot element, that'd actually be pretty cool.  If the show had the new member of the Valar, Captain Planet, select a child from each of the peoples of Middle Earth to fight against the evil property developer Sauron, and the male Dunedain child was depicted as uniquely stupid and selfish, it'd be unwatchable drek.  If the show cast the actors without regard to whether their skin colors matched what we'd expect, it'd be startling, but not necessarily bad.  If Gandalf were the focus of the show and was portrayed by a "person of color", if the acting and story was good I think it'd be fine as long as Gandalf was still Gandalf.  He didn't become Gandalf the White because of the color of his skin.  But if they did that and made a major plot point how racial prejudice against him impedes Gandalf's efforts to work against Sauron, you've left Middle Earth far behind and returned to a more modern morality play.  This would not bode well, both because it's abandoned the material I love, and because I find most morality plays to be simultaneously insufferable and boring.

## 53 [JJ48 on February 5, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/263165-new-amazon-show/?do=findComment&comment=3200342)

I think adapting a work can be tough, because what works in text doesn't always work on screen, and vice-versa.  More important is to retain the theme and feel of a work (or to deviate from it intentionally, if you have your own point to make, I guess).  In this, I actually think Peter Jackson's Hobbit movies did remarkably well, especially when compared to other adaptations like Middle-earth:  Shadow of Mordor.

I will be very interested to see what themes are woven into the show's narrative.  Will we see high hope (the knowledge that, "in the end the Shadow was only a small and passing thing: there was light and high beauty for ever beyond its reach")?  Will faithful service and humility correlate to a character's awesomeness?  Will elven military leaders display even the tiniest bit of tactical know-how, or were all such captains killed off during the Last Alliance?

## 54 [Otherworlder on February 6, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/263165-new-amazon-show/?do=findComment&comment=3201914)

The most culturally and racially respectful and progressive thing to do in Middle-earth is to show Harad and Rhun etc., as civilizationally and culturally distinct from the West yet equals on firm footing. Showing them as "protagonists" isn't it; you know, a band of tattered Haradrim in desperate need of the white heroes' rescue to escape the wrath of Sauron and then join in the grand fight, thus saving their people, that actually feels more offensive. They don't need to be on the side of good; they aren't according to Tolkien. And storytellers don't need to justify those people by showing the "good ones" among them. Sure, fringe rebellious groups are cool; that's showing diversity among diversity. But true justified portrayal is to show people who are reasonably outside of the West's religious and political framework. Come now, if Harad and Rhun don't know about the Valar, don't worship, and don't care for European myths, it's perfectly rational for them to treat Mordor just as another nation; a weird one, but still a perfectly legitimate ally for their own political objectives. I mean, Middle-earth hasn't reached enlightenment and industrial revolution in general, so you would imagine non-European civilizations actually being larger in scale, mysteriously and fabulously wealthy, etc.

One way they could do this kind of thing right (and just do the show right) would be to bring in the right people. There are so many Tolkien scholars out there doing great work, and they're going to have a huge budget, so I hope they hire a Corey Olsen or Tom Shippey type to help keep things in line.

It makes sense.  Sauron wouldn't bother gathering armies from that far abroad unless the armies were worth gathering.

Thank you for an interesting set of comments. I thought that FFGs approach to the Haradrim in this cycle was revolutionary and actually quite sophisticated - showing them as culturally more complex than just unthinking baddies. In the last AP which should be appearing any time now, the Gondorian's are shown to be racist - which they actually were. To my mind this subverts just about every previous view of Middle Earth. I do take your point that this cycle could be seen as offensive, but overall I think FFG deserve lots of credit. Had they done as you suggest, they could be criticised for following the trope that "all coloured people are evil".

Two further points:

1) Tolkien didn't detail much about the Haradrim but he deliberately gave Sam famous lines in which he wonders about them and their motivations - hinting that there's more going on than unthinking evil. In my view FFG are following Tolkien's conception.

2) FFG haven't shown all Haradrim as tattered - Na'asiyah in particular is very tough. Others are shown as evil, but in all fairness they're encounter deck cards and not player ones. Overall I do think there's nuance into FFGs conception of the Haradrim.

Tolkien mentions in Appendix A, part I, section v, that after Aragorn's stint as Thorongil, he "went alone far into the East and deep into the South, exploring the hearts of Men, both evil and good, and uncovering the plots and devices of the servants of Sauron."  So it's certainly canonical that good as well as evil was to be found among both Southron and Easterling; and "uncovering the plots and devices" also means both that Sauron did not have full control of those two vast areas, and that exposing Sauron's role made those peoples less likely to cooperate.  Even of the subset of Easterlings and Southrons gathered by Sauron to fight directly for him, the most part abandoned his cause once deprived of his will (in "Field of Cormallen") -- though there was some even then, "those that were deepest and longest in evil servitude" that continued to fight even then, and we know from Appendix A part II that Aragorn & Eomer fought "beyond the Sea of Rhun and on the far fields of the South" before "the White Tree could grow in peace."

I mean it might but it is basically almost everything, so I assume it was more of a jest, whilst the real hints were the maps, and the show will be about the Second Age (for the start, at least). And I would be very happy with that, much happier than the young Aragorn plotline...
