So i was wondering, is it possible to win the game if there are still enemies in play?

 

For example: i am on the last stage of a quest and after the quest resolution i have more than enough progress points on it, i can still win the game without having to kill the enemies right?

Having no more enemies is not part of the victory conditions,

 

Fullfilling the last quest is enough. Then you have quest and other encounter cards that add victory conditions or prevent victory.

 

Killing all enemies is part of the second core set's scenario, and I think there is one or two other quest that have it, but it is always writen somewhere.
