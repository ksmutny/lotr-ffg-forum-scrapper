Is the following list what we are expecting from FFG for the LOTR LCG until the end of 2012 now? The second Hobbit set has gone a bit quiet, but it looks like no releases really until later this year (aside one POD set from GenCon) - Is Sep-Nov going to be bare of releases?

 * POD - Battle of Lake-Town - if it follows the previous GenCon POD release, The Massing at Osgiliath, this shouldn't be too long on it's release.
 * 2nd Saga Expansion Hobbit set - unnamed? I am guessing this will come out before the Heirs of Numenor set., but it's late 2012 right?
 * The Lord of the Rings: Heirs of Numenor Expansion - Q4 2012
 * 2013! LOTR LCG Against the Shadow Adventure set (linked to the Heirs of Numenor)

 The second hobbit saga expansion is called "On the Doorstep"……and yes…the schedule is going to be more or less what you've written…
