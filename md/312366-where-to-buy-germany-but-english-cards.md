I need the last six APs to complete my collection.  Sadly, my local dealer has only the first AP (Wrath and Ruin) listed, saying the others are not officially released yet (in Germany) and the store has not goten any of the 2nd to 6th AP. And even the 1st is sold out - more are ordered, but they got none from that FFG retailer. (Since about half a year or something like that!)

So I do wonder if anyone can recommend me an store which has the english version of all the 6 APs in stock (for a reasonable price) and ships (also for a reasonable price) to Germany?!?

I posted this some time ago. It is UK stockists. I would imagine most will post to Germany at a reasonable price. Good luck!

thanks

edit: I searched all the listed shops for Under the Ash Mountains [https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-card-game/products/under-ash-mountains], the second AP from the cycle. Some pages are closed, some shops do not list that AP and all the others list that as out of stock. I didn't try the other APs.
