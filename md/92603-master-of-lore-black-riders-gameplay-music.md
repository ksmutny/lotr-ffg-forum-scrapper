Hey, this was a pretty good, fun article. I got BR just today so I think I'll be trying your suggestions.

 

BTW shipwreck, have you heard about Colin Rudd? He's a guitarist (or dare I say, a bard) who has smade some pretty good musicalizations of some famous Tolkien poems, such as Durin's song as sung by Gimli in Moria, Frodo's lament for Gandalf, the lament for Boromir, and others (he even did the Mewlips!). I think you'll maybe want to take a look at them when we get to The Road Darkens.

 

Here's a link to some of his videos

I think this guy is the best when it comes to sung Tolkien poetry.

Chance Thomas for me- the original composer for the lord of the rings online game. look up lotro soundtracks or something similar.

 

for those who are familiar wiith lotro my favourite piece is when you cross the brandywine bridge. amazing.

 

its a shame that the only way to get the tracks was to buy the deluxe game edition years before i even started

rich
