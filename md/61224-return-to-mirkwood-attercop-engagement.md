If you are in a 2-player game, does attercop engage a new player each time the player guarding Gollum changes, or once the mighty spider engages a player, does he remain engaged in combat with that player to the bitter end?

It engages the new player.

 

 

Attercop's forced effect kicks in at the beginning of each encounter phase. So, if Gollum changes hands at the end of a round, Attercop will engage Gollum's new guard at the start of the next encounter phase. The spider always chases that slimy little bugger.

Oh, gosh, I have been playing it wrong!  I was thinking engagement was a one-time thing, but for some reason I actually re-read the card today, and realized that I may have been making a mistake.  Thanks for your help.
