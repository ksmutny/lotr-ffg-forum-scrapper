I mean stuff like Glamdring, Orcrist, Sting and so on. Not just direct copies, but "installments" of those cards  in their regular version. To take with you into any quest any time.

Yes, but they would be OP if left unchanged. Some of them need to have doubled cost

Well, I don't imagine them becoming a regular player cards without any actual text change. I wonder what sphere would each go to...

 

Sting - Lore, Orcrist - Spirit, Glamdring - Leadership. That's my feelings somehow. What treasures worth of playercardification are left out there?

Of course, they would have to be powered down to be balanced. If anyone's wondering, the reason I want to have them as player cards is because, even though the boons and treasures are great and thematic, they just feel more like encounter cards than player cards. Having actual player cards of such iconic objects that you can take with you to any quest would be the best. Now regarding spheres, I'd be content to keep them all neutral, but that could easily get out of hand. My suggestion would be Spirit or Lore for Sting, Tactics or Spirit for Orcrist, Leadership for Andúril and I would keep Glamdring neutral like all the other Gandalf attachments. Other objects that need the treatment IMO is the Phial of Galadriel and the Elven rope. I would even like to have a One Ring neutral attachment.

If they were kept "limit one per deck" they would not have to change much if at all.

I am most eager to get a fully playable version of Sting.

Do you mean by rarity?

Pretty much. I put Anduril in my saga decks with Aragorn, but in the long run is not that powerful because you don't draw it often.
