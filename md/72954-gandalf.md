 Does the 5 threat reduction granted by the appearance of Gandalf apply to both players in a two player game or just the 'owner' of Gandalf?

I'm guessing it's only one player but my thoughts are that if Gandalf joins your team of heroes on an adventure then everyone's spirit would be lifted, not just half of them? Please let me know the official ruling.

To prevent those questions from appearing, read the card text. It reads: "Reduce your threat by 5."

"Your" means the one who plays him. Too obvious.

it may be obvious to some….everyone who has played this game makes mistakes

Migwald,

There are some snarky answers on here from time to time, folks that are real tigers behind the keyboard and the security of cyberspace.  But many of us have a more mature and gentle spirit.  So please be encouraged to ask questions when you're confused happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif].

While I think MyNeighborTrololo is correct, it would have been nice if he/she had been more "neighborly" in conveying the response.  To me, at least, it seems all "too obvious" that "your" can refer to the singular or plural, so it's not inconceivable that a new player could be confused about that very text and its application.

 Thanks for the confirmation. It's as I thought but feel my comment was valid about Gandalf bringing hope to everyone, not just half the group. At least I have been playing it correctly.

Cheers folks

There is a thingy called rulebook. And sometimes errata. They contain many neat stuff.

 It may be thematically "valid" for Gandalf to bring hope to all of the group (I'm still wondering a tie between hope and threat level), but as long as card text refers to a single person, not to "each player" - it affects only this person, period.

Oh, I bet you'd beat me sensless if I'd dare to say something like that in real life, wouldn't you?

No, I wouldn't beat you "sensless" -- though I might hand you a dictionary.  I'll just say the following (and you feel free to have the last word):  Are you bolder behind a keyboard than in real life?  And, if so, is that a practice you ought to continue?  I think you were needlessly harsh on someone who probably was asking a sincere question, however obvious or ill-founded it may have seemed to you.  Even if you were technically correct, to what end does the attitude serve?  Do gratuitous put-downs like "too obvious" give you a higher sense of self-worth?  Nearly everyone can recognize a cyber-bully when they see one -- except, sadly, the bully himself for lack of self-reflection.  For your own sake, I hope you'll reflect upon your actions.  Again, if you feel the need to "save face," I'm going to let you have the last word.  But I hope you'll consider what I say, even if your pride compels you to prove my point by further postings in the same deleterious spirit.

I'm not proud and the way I acted doesn't connects to the way I am in any case. It's just ignorance. The answer is before you, you could just read it - but no, you come to the forum and ask the question, based on your "thought it would be more thematically". So, if you think so - play it as you wish, nobody will care.

This is just god **** ignorance.

If I got asked the same question in real life? My reaction would be the same. And honestly, for me it was kind of soft.

 I guess some people are more tolerant of 'ignorance' than others and those that aren't feel obliged to make it obvious. It takes all sorts. My query has been answered and confirmed my interpretation was correct, I was simply curious. Thanks folks.
