I was reading through the rulebook PDF, and I noticed the picture of the Treachery card Under the Shadow shows the card's effect being "Doomed X. (X is the number of players in the game.)"  Under the Shadow is a much less threatening card now. gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]

I think it's fun to find text from early play-testing just to see the changes the made during the development process.

Yes we already talking about it long time ago. In May or June.

 Ah, I totally missed that conversation.

Yeah, that is a big difference. Was there the same Shadow effect? Probably (the Shadow effect being much worse than the "when revealed"). As it is now, it is the one card I hope for the most during staging, I barely play 3+ player games, but even there it is not devastating.
