maybe i play too much, or maybe becuase they are very thin i dont know, but my core set, especially the deck ive built is getting bent and quite worn, time for some sleeves i think

 I sleeved mine as soon as I got them.

I never play with unsleeved cards. I spend too much on cards to allow them to get damaged when it is easily avoided.

Mine are getting worn as well.  I need to get sleeve.  This is my first LCG or CCG so I did not even think about it, but now I know.  Buy some sleeves.

yes this was my first as well, really stupid question but which ones will fit?

Sleeved mine immediately. I expect them to last a long time.

Sleeving made my cards really easy to handle and gaming relaxing I can recommend you to sleeve up immediately. My tokens got soaked today though bostezo.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/bostezo.gif] I use clear sleeves because I like the artwork on the back of the cards and it's also good for the quest. Guess it's up to taste what kind of sleeves you want to use.

As for the size of the sleeves, you can find the measurements recommended by ffg here:

While my cards are fine because I've sleeved them, the sleeves for the Encounter Deck are wearing quite quickly because of the amount of plays/shuffles they've gone through. It seems that if I keep playing at this high of a rate, I'll be replacing those sleeves fairly often. It's bittersweet gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]

Man, what kind of sleeves did you get and how do you shuffle sorpresa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sorpresa.gif] ? To date, 2,600+ plays of WWE Raw Deal and I haven't had to replace a single sleeve due to wearing/tearing and I use penny sleeves for it.

I had to replace an FFG sleeve the other day - Sometimes when you shuffle with them, the edge gets caught on another card - but better that than the card itself.  Everyone should sleeve their cards!

## 12 [ioticus on May 8, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46464-anybodys-cards-getting-worn-already/?do=findComment&comment=465309)

Yeah, I will never understand the sleeve haters.  They must like damaged cards.  They are also much easier to shuffle.

I finally picked up some protective sleeves, my local retailer doesn't have any, so a trip to Manchester on free comic book day mean't I could swing by the rpg shop.

I got the recommended ones above - Standard Card Game Sleeves (FFS05). I'll probs get the Art Sleeves for the Hero cards, when they come out.

Something by Ultra Pro, I forget the exact name. I basically do all shuffling message besides bridge. Idk, I guess I'm just an ape. gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif] To be clear though, I've probably shuffled that encounter deck upwards of 100 times already.

I immediately sleeved my cards as soon as I got them, using those Ultra-Pro penny sleeves.  Of course, since I'm pretty much obsessed with this game, I'll be switching them into FFG's premium sleeves when they arrive in the mail around Wednesday.

I do the side shuffle the guy in the video does:

www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/647935/sleeving-these-beautiful-cards/page/2 [http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/647935/sleeving-these-beautiful-cards/page/2]

Although I don't hold the deck as tightly as the guy does, I prefer a more loose hold on the deck, less need to force the cards in between one another.

That's what I do. Idk, maybe my sleeves are just crappy.

Omg without sleeves this type of shuffle is somehow a type of crime.I can imagine Gandalf going out of the box yelling YOU CANNOT SHUFFLE...sorpresa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sorpresa.gif]

 Ultra Pro is the way to go. They shuffle so well and really hold up.  I like Dragon Shields, too, even though they are super thick. Maybe I will use the Shields for the encounter deck..so it looks as tall as Orthanc.

I've now played over a hundred games unsleeved and there's no sign of wear, so far. I may eventually sleeve them, but probably not before the first AP cylce is done.
