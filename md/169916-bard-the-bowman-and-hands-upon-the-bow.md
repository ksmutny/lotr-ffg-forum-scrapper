hands upon the bow said choose an enemy in the staging area to make an attack, while bard's ability is to reduce enemy's defense while making a ranged attack

so my question is, is attacking enemy in the staging area a ranged attack?

I found in the rule book saying a ranged attack is while you're attacking an enemy engaged with another player.

I think I may have answered my own question, it's just a little odd to me...

Yeah it's pretty silly really (especially with Hands Upon the Bow!) but attacks against enemies in the staging area unfortunately do not count as ranged attacks.

...unless the card effect which generates them specifically states otherwise - like Great Yew Bow.
