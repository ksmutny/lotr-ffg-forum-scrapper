Hi guys,

I have a doubt about Keen as Lances, the victory display only has cards with victory points, then how could Keen as Lances reduce its cost? or can the victory display pile include cards with no victory points? what would be examples of those cards?

Text:

Reduce the cost to play Keen as Lances by 1 for each card worth no victory points in the victory display. Action: Add Keen as Lances to the victory display. Then, choose one: add 2 resources to a hero's resource pool, draw 3 cards, or reduce your threat by 4.

Regards,

Hi,
Some players cards go to the victory pile. Like Keen as lances for example. The second keen as lances, and that count for the group so no matter who play it, would only cost 4.

Here is a link with some of the card who use the victory display: http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/8379/mono-lore-scrying-for-multiplayer-3.0 [http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/8379/mono-lore-scrying-for-multiplayer-3.0]
