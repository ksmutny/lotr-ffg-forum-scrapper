Using the Ranger Bow is not a Combat Action?

So it can be used against a creature that was just added to the staging area?

No, it isn't

 

 

If it was it said explicity Combat Action, as it is on Feint

This could become very useful in refresh because some enemies have an end of round of effect you would like to avoid. For example, Giant Marsh Worm, the Watcher, Durin's Bane, Any captain in The Morgul Vale (because of the Bodyguards). If you ask me a very nice free option to the players.
