What do you do with excess progress tokens after a quest has reached it's limits but not completed due to some conditions that hasn't yet been fulfilled? Example, Quest=Down the Anduin 1B, progress tokens needed=8, condition=No Hill Trolls may be in play in order to fulfill the quest. SO, when you have 8 tokens on it and still need to defeat the Troll what do you do with excess tokens? You still need to quest each quest phase but do you just stop putting tokens on or will you end up with say 21 tokens before you defeat the Troll?

 

The reason I think this is important is if you get some encounter/shadow effects that tells you to remove x tokens from the current quest. I always play with when the max tokens are reached, in this case 8, I stop putting tokens on, and if I loose some tokens then I just have to get some more progress when the Troll is defeated. But since this can make or brake your game I just wanted to know what you do. Don't wanna make the game unnecessary difficult :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

I've been thinking about this for a while but didn't think it important until yesterday where I discovered it might have made things easier.

I certainly don't see anything which says you can't put extra tokens on the quest card, so yes, in the examples given, go over the total, and if tokens are removed you'll still be ok.

That said, I usually give up putting tokens on Emyn Muil after a round or two.

This came up on the forums previously so I asked Nate. There is no limit to the amount of progress tokens that can be on the quest. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Sweet. That'll make it a little easier AND creates a way to increase the difficulty if it gets too easy in the future.

Oh boy, I can see a new treachery card coming down the pipe:

"Remove all progress tokens from the current quest and any locations. Return to stage one of the quest. Yeah, that just happened. Your sweet salty tears sustain me."

Shhh! They'll hear you!

Sorry for what may be a noob question: why do you say you have to quest each turn? Isn't that optional?

If you don't commit any characters to quest, you'll be going up against whatever is in the staging area's Threat with 0 Willpower. So you'll have to up your threat level, and that's a bad thing.

You can't skip the Quest phase. Basically, yes, you have to quest or else your Threat level will increase quickly and you risk losing if it hits 50 and enemies will overwhelm you.

None of the steps in a turn are optional. You HAVE to do all of them, including questing. If you commit no characters questing still happens, but as Lenbo said you have a Willpower of 0 versus whatever threat is in the staging area.

 and there's still another reason, why some other people find this game too easy... :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] which I also thought the first 2 games and then I reread the rulebook...

btw: FAQ this, Mr Pumpkin! Excess progress tokens are placed on the quest card if it cannot be completed due to other requirements - such as Hill Trolls and Emyn Muil Locations...

and don't put any more bad ideas into ffg's head :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] remove all progress tokens and reset your quest...

how about - double your threat, if it is under 15!!!! that would be a good anti-spirit card :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

I don't know if I want to go that far sorpresa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sorpresa.gif]

However, some treachery cards that target low threat players would throw a wrench into a lot of power gamer decks right now. We have a lot of cards that target players with threat that is high (think Evil Storm). It would be interesting to see the reverse - targeting players with threat below 20 perhaps?

Back on topic, I think the worst we have right now is removing four tokens at a time (Despair) plus some others. Keep adding on the tokens I say.

Make Enemies with engagement cost 0 (or very low in any case) that cannot be actively engaged, instead like Snagas from MaO, they Forced engage the player with the lowest threat level. Or some big hitter that when in play prevents threat reduction.

"If your threat is negative, remove the minus sign"

?
