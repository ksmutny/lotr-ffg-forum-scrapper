If you can be a little patient, it's listed as "at the printer" on the FFG Upcoming Products page... so should be more readily available (i.e., affordable) in the coming months.

The Upcoming FFG page now lists the entire Mirkwood cycle as "On the Boat" as of 10/6/15 (yesterday). So its on the way, but unfortunately probably still 4-6 weeks out.
