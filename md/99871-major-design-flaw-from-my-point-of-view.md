Yes, I know, promoting monosphering and stuff, but...

 

As we recently found out, they will try to reinforce Silvan elves in this new cycle. And I don't think it was a spontainous decision, yet they give one of two existing Silvan heroes ability that has nothing to do with Silvan trait at all. More of it, other Silvan elf is tactics hero, and an upcoming one is of the leadership, meaning that her usefulness in the Silvan hero deck is -1 starting threat. 

 

My question is... WHY? Why on earth her text is not: "Each hero you control with a Silvan trait or a printed Lore resource icon gets -1 threat cost."?

because forcing tribes suck and there is enough of that in the game already.

Running her in a silvan deck would work fine, with two attack, and maybe there will be more Lore Silvan heroes. Legolas's ability isn't Silvan related either. She also lets you access Lore for the Silvan healer card. Your suggestion would have been fine, but I wouldn't call this a Flaw.

Just a disclaimer: "Major flaw" was kind of intended overstatement.

 

Legolas was a very first hero, there was no plan for a silvan trait love then.

 

booored, it's not forcing a tribe, it's making an extremely limited ability being useful in more than one situation.

I always thought it was a missed opportunity. I don't mind Mirlond, but if her ability included Silvan heroes i would have been thrilled. Her, Legolas and Celeborn would have been 25 starting threat not a big difference then 27 and not game breaking at all. The 2 threat discount for that hero line up makes it more attractive then 27, especially running a tri sphere deck with those heroes it probably would have given them just the edge they needed.

Building a deck around spheres (not only for economy maters) too and not only around traits ads another layer of deck building options/strategies, so i partially agree with booooored  ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

And my suggestion does not removes the lore synergy, it's just adds the Silvan trait as a legal target for her ability, so I kinda cant find the point of your message.

I imagine Mirlonde guiding the wise characters, silvans or not. She is friendly with all that loves wisdom.

Yeah, and you must be imagining her refusing "to guide" her own people because they have different ways? Please, for the love of Innos don't drag theme into this. Of all cards, Milronde is one of the most unthematic ones.

Yes all the characters will be better if you just ad something to them and your point is ?

Same reason that Denethor's ability is in no way restricted to Gondor, nor is Tactics Boromir, nor is Frodo's ability restricted to Hobbits in some way, or Balin restricted somehow to Dwarves.  There's nothing wrong with making a character whose ability is not tied to their traits.... it's not even a missed opportunity, just a different type of card.

I think Trollo is saying that Mirlonde should reduce the starting threat of Lore AND Silvan, but maybe I misunderstand. Anyway it's splitting hairs to me.

## 13 [chuckles on February 23, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99871-major-design-flaw-from-my-point-of-view/?do=findComment&comment=993052)

I don't think that it's broken or a flaw... but, at times, I do find it annoying that Mirlonde's ability is Lore only. I would have really loved it to have been Lore or Silvan Heroes... More Lore Silvan Heroes would help... oh and more Silvan allies for all the other sphere's.

given that this card was designed by a different designer (lucas)  than that who is designing the silvan trait (caleb) - it's too be expected.

 

you have to remember these cards are designed/play tested a good year or more before they are released. it's not like it was designed knowing what the silvan synergy would be (especially since lead designers changed in the process!).

Its a good point you make Dain.

iznax and GrandSpleen, you both seem to miss the entire point either on purpose of because of low understanding capabilities, but in any case I'm not going to respond to you anymore.

 

Bullroarer Took, exactly, in my variant it works on both Silvan and Lore heroes, I don't understand what would make you think otherwise, the text is pretty clear. 

 

Dain, well, that's a sad thing. Too bad this game can't be fixed all over the world by a single line change, like a computer one.

I don't think there is anything wrong with Mirlonde. She's one of the best designed heroes we got during the AtS cycle.

 

Of course they could have switched Lore with Silvan on the card text, but I wouldn't consider it a design flaw, especially as a decent amount of Silvan heroes should be assigned to the lore sphere. Would it be too overpowered to give that ability to another Silvan lore hero? A combo of Mirlonde and that hero would lower the starting threat by 4 points, making it a good start for a secrecy deck.

 

The theme of Mirlonde's ability is very thematic. She doesn't have to teach other Silvan heroes how to hide,because they already are pros in that facility. But teaching non Silvan heroes - who are able to adapt her lessons - how to avoid enemy contact seems like a logical thing to me.

 

Last but not least one of the major themes during the AtS cycle were mono sphere decks, and it that regard they did a good job with Mirlonde.

I can't make my powerful cheap threat silvan deck.. so it is a design flaw ؟

Why switch? Did I said "switch" anywhere? In ,y variant, she's still works with Lore heroes, but now with Silvan ones in addiiton.

 

Seriously? Trying to drag theme into this again? Ok, I'll counter your "arguement" by saying that knowing how to hide in terms of this game is having 1 less threat cost than sum of your stats. Silvan heroes do not have that, so they technically don't know how to.

It is i was going to say.... Mirlonde seems be designed to run good in a trap deck (with Faramir hero, traps, Advanced Warning [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/against-the-shadow/the-druadan-forest/advance-warning-tdf]), in fact, lots of cards in the same adventure where Mirlonde was released -Advanced Warning is it!-, are for monosphere decks: Strength of arms [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/against-the-shadow/the-druadan-forest/strength-of-arms-tdf], Against the Shadow [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/against-the-shadow/the-druadan-forest/against-the-shadow-tdf], White Tower Watchman [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/against-the-shadow/the-druadan-forest/white-tower-watchman-tdf], and Trained for War [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/against-the-shadow/the-druadan-forest/trained-for-war-tdf].

You know in life there will be some that will not agree with you, there is not low understanding capabilities from their side but low communication capabilities from yours. If you read all the post in this topic, what we all say in simple words is that, if a hero/character doesn't have a trait synergy it is not a MAJOR DESIGN FLOW by any means.

I see no harm in her supporting her people too. Just a little bit of additional synergy.

Because there haven't been enough Silvan heroes released yet? ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] You can already build powerful Elven decks around Mirlonde. Ask Glaurung!

## 25 [chuckles on February 23, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99871-major-design-flaw-from-my-point-of-view/?do=findComment&comment=993424)

^ Yes you can build powerful Elven decks (with or without Mirlonde). Your hero choices are rather limited (for Silvan alone) and considering you can build many different kinds of decks that are powerful, themed or non themed I don't think that just because there is a power option, that more choices or synergies are bad - unless game breaking! (I agree its not a design flaw). Personally I don't think there are enough Silvan heroes released yet, a couple more Lore Silvan Heroes would be mint ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]
