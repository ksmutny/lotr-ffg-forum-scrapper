Can someone tell me what are the cards spoiled for the digital game and what are doing?

Aragorn: Spend 1 resource to ready him

Gimli: +Attack when damaged

Arwen: Heal 1 damage on a character each round

Blade of Gondolin: +1 Attack

Feint: Enemy gets 0 attack for the round

Advanced Warning: Next enemy Sauron plays becomes exhausted (can't attack that turn)

Ithilien Lookout: Can't remember exactly, but I think he exhausts an enemy when he enters play.

Galadhon Archer: Deal 1 damage to an enemy when he enters play

 

So it looks like most of the player card effects are heavily inspired, if not a direct port, of the physical versions.

How many attacks does Gimli can gain? I'm pretty excited to try this game :).

Self-Prevesrvation: 2 mana heal 1 damage from attched character at the end of the round.

Seastan, yes, Ithilien Lookout exhausts enemy when enters play.

One. His keyword allows him to not exhaust when being attacked once per turn.

I  can't remember exactly, but I think it resets each round so he only gets +attack on rounds when he's damaged.

I fully expect unexpected courage or ever vigilant to enable action advantage. If that might be able to be combined with Gimli remains to be seen (spheres and other limitations).

For those who didn't hear, FFI was not able to save this afternoon's stream, but they will do so in the future. They also mean to stream every Tues/Thurs afternoon, though I'm not sure gameplay will be the focus of each one. In other words, lots more potential spoilers coming!

## 9 [Authraw on December 13, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/265277-digital-cards/?do=findComment&comment=3123215)

Oh no! I missed it since I was at work when they were streaming. For those who were able to attend, what are your thoughts? What did we learn? 

## 10 [Seastan on December 13, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/265277-digital-cards/?do=findComment&comment=3123311)

Without the video, I supposed the most complete retelling of the content of the stream are the live updates @sappidus [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/251007-sappidus/] did in the lotr-dcg channel of the CotR discord server.

Oh, I almost forgot. The was a semi-spoil of Legolas. He is now an ally with Fleeting keyword (means he leaves play at the end of the round, like Gandalf). Rest of the text was obscured, but I think he had "Arrival" - meaning he did something when he entered play. I might be wrong, this is just how I remembered it. He also had crazy attack value, I think, like 5 or 6.

Hello!Thank you all!As for Legolas,I had partially seen it as a 6 attack,12 health,4 willpower Fleeting.Arrival:Choose one:Draw 3 cards or deal 3 damage to an enemy.

Does Arrival trigger from effects that put into play(Like Sneak Attack)?

Also does anybody know the cost,stats,spheres?Will be neutral cards?How can we play the game without Steam(after is  released for a wider audience)?How much Valour we get(and how we can beat a scenario ,,with a different strategy")?How many cards we have without buying anything?

## 14 [John Constantine on December 13, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/265277-digital-cards/?do=findComment&comment=3123648)

Most of that remains to be seen. There should be a stream today (if I understood that correctly), try hopping on and asking.

## 15 [Veve7 on December 13, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/265277-digital-cards/?do=findComment&comment=3123655)

Also i remember a card with Guard of the Citadel art  as a 1 attack,3 health,0 willpower Sentinel. [http://www.lotrlcg.com/Card/Focus/1013]
