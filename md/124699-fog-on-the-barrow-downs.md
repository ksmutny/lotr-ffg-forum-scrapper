I've seen a few people asking for information about the quest. If you don't want to know about it, don't read further! I'm going to give a quick overview rather than going card-by-card, as I don't have it in front of me, but I really enjoyed the quest. I think four-player is the hardest, solo or two would be the sweet spot here. 

 

 

 

The major mechanic involves getting spun off into individual staging areas similar to Foundations of Stone or The Breaking of the Fellowship. The twist here is that you get sent off on your own if "your" player card is a certain type of Barrow. 

 

[bIG SPOILER] When you get spun out on your own, you have to discard all allies except X, where X is the number of enemies engaged with you. This was a HUGE surprise, and as I was running a Gondor ally mustering deck, was quite the moment. To clear your own staging area, you have to quest 9 points worth, but any location revealed at your stage is canceled--you raise your threat by its threat cost instead. This, coupled with other threat raising mechanics, really puts the pressure on you throughout.

 

There are a few cool new effects on locations. Notably, one of them makes you defend Wights with your Willpower value while it is in the staging area. The enemies also have negative effects while engaged with you, like not letting you draw cards, produce resources, or the like. The enemies themselves are not super high stat wise.

 

All in all, a great flavor and a fun quest!

Thanks for the brief review! I was looking forward to this scenario since it was announce, as the Barrow downs and Barrow wights are some of my favorite themes in Lotr. Now what I'd really like to see is some images of the cards (other than the ones Matthew posted on Facebok), especially to see the art.

Played this solo today and was wondering about the "spinning out" into your own Barrow. Since the 3A/3B staging area is somewhere else, won't you always discard all allies?

I am pretty sure that you will retain all enemies engaged with you and therefore X can be a positive number.

That's some cool stuff, thanks for your time.

Very enjoyable review. Stuff like this really satiates my hunger for news and previews, which FFG seems to have forgotten about. Looking forward to seeing more cards from the quest, and the art looks amazing.

Just to be clear, is there only 3 enemies in this quest?

It looks like it but I can't say for sure!

There are only the three different types of enemies, yes. They each are in the encounter deck several times.

Hello all,

 

I was able to play the Fellowship Event at Labyrinth Games in Washington, D.C. yesterday afternoon (Sunday 10/12/2014).  I had a really great time playing Fog on the Barrow downs with four players.  The scenario is pretty difficult with several people, though obviously if you take the time to review the Encounter Deck and the Quest Deck you can certainly build decks that would make the scenario trivial, as is the case with most LOTR scenarios.

 

As OKTarg said, the three wights shown in the TalesfromtheCards photos are the three types of enemies encountered in Fog on the Barrow Downs.  For those who may be wondering, however, there are multiple copies of each of the three wights in the encounter deck.  I don't recall the specific numbers, but its about 4 or 5 of each wight, so on the order of 12-15 enemies.  As the TFtC website also indicates, there are some cards which will cause the wights to respawn in various ways, so you will be encountering wights very frequently.  Fans of martial decks will enjoy this scenario - the wights are always coming after you.  But there's certainly far more than combat required to succeed in the scenario.

The quest is much more difficult with four players.  I had a rather easy time of it using my solo Hobbit deck with Frodo as the Ringbearer.  Playing in the event with four players, we got crushed twice.  The treachery is just wicked and pulling four cards a turn makes them cycle constantly.

Wow. So many wights.

> Wow. So many wights.

 

Yes, and each type of wight has some annoying effect for the engaged player, and then there is some other card (forgetting which) that makes it so each wight's effect applies to all players, not just the engaged player. They do things like stop you from drawing cards, make you raise your threat, etc.

Souns like if you got some of them really early - you're done, because they'll block most of progression you can make while you don't have enough power to deal with em.

It's ok, because of the treachery that raise the staging area threat by engaged enemy, it is really weak. But if you don't have engaged enemy, it will bring one, and this is bad.

Also, all enemies have 1 defense, so you can deal with them over time if need be.

Their effect is not very impactfull half of the time in multiplayer. In solo, it depends on what you rely and on what wight you draw.

Their attack is quite strong, however, but the location that switch willpower for defense is likely a bonus (at least when you're not tactics).

Got defeated twice playing with Raven1015 in Berkeley. Great fun! 

Built my first Gandalf deck and won once I got home.

I really like this scenario but it's much more fun playing multiplayer.

 

There's some freakin creepy artwork, love it!

 

Edit:

Oh, and for the record, I chose to play with Fellowship Frodo since it's part of the Saga expansions

Just had our Fellowship event in the Seattle area today.  We had a great time!  

 

RagnaarHaas and I finished this quest on our second attempt with Theoden-Eomer-Merry and Gandalf-Aragorn(Lo)-Glorfindel(Sp).  One other group at the event was successful, while two others could not complete it.

 

I went home this evening and played the quest on campaign mode with my wife so we could check this off on our campaign.  Won on the third try using Glorfindel(Sp)-Merry-Fatty and Aragorn(Lo)-Pippin(Lo)-Sam.  Fatty was really dead weight on this quest.  I didn't use his ability even once and I couldn't use him for defense.  He was really great for the Black Riders quest but just fizzled here.

 

I really enjoyed this quest.  It is dripping with theme, and the difficulty level fits right into those Black Riders quests. Hoping for more like this in the future!

Reviving this thread, although it is old by now... My question is this: As this is the first "Fellowship Event" in this LCG, does anyone know if FFG is planning on releasing this as Print-On-Demand? I have not seen or heard any solid confirmation on this, but I assume they will...?

Would like to know this as well.

My understanding is that all of the Fellowship events will be released (after a delay) via Print on Demand, just as the GenCon scenarios are. This obviously would not include the Playmat, and I don't think it would include the alternate-art Aragorn card either.
