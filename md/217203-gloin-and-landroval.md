Can you trigger Gloin's response due to Landroval's repsonse?

This one could go either way. Given that he is entering play with a damage already on him I would guess no.

I would say no. Gloin has not "suffered" damage. In practical terms, if Gloin has been destroyed he has more than likely taken 4 damage. So being put back into play with just 1 damage could be considered damage reduction if anything!
