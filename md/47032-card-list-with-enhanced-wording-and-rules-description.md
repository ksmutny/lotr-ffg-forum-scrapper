What do you all think about getting a thread going (similar to the FAQ) that lists specific cards out and then seeks to clarify the rules of each card? This would be helpful to noob's (me) that have never played a card game before and get completely hung up on what the rules of the cards mean.  I mean, some cards are self explanatory but there are some that leave me scratching my head.

 That is awesome kirkbauer. I will add link to that on the front page of my site. 

Have you thought about putting it up on Google Documents? You can make it public to view, but restrict the number of people who can edit it - then you don't have to be responsible for all the work.

I just did a quick glance and saw something.  For Beorn:  The description should say that he "either goes to your hand or is shuffled into your deck" and not "either goes to your hand or discard pile."

Also, in AGoT (and I'm assuming the rest of the LCGs) the First Player chooses the order that actions resolve.  So, you wouldn't get to decided whether or not Beorn returned to your hand.  Whoever is the First Player at the time will choose for you.

I think that one of the rules is that the First Player makes the ultimate decision, but it's a co-op game. Why would he not send him back to your hand vs shuffling him?
