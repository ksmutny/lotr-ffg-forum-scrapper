Shortly: We are playing 2 player game. We both discard cards in order to give Eowyn +2 willpower. Did we play right or does the wording mean that each player can trigger Eowyn's ability, but it can be triggered once per round.

 

I hope i wasn't unclear and thanks for advance to anyone who helps me.

You were correct. Each player can trigger Eowyn's boost separately each round.
