hello. great game. really enjoying it so far.

i decided to create a new box to hold the game and built it out of the original box and contents.

it retains the look and artwork of the full box, but in a smaller miniturised version.

 

here's the outside of the box:

lifting off the outer lid reveals a space to store the rule book and printouts:

lifting the 2nd lid reveals a space to store the threat counters:

lifting the inner lid reveals the cards (sleeved) and components:

inner artwork inside the box:

and finally the bottom of the box retains the components info:

I did it a little bit easier - i folded only the cardboard new and now i have space for two complete core-sets and certain for the 1st 6 expansions too.

i did wonder about space for the expansions. but decided i would probably eventually run out of space as more and more expansions were released. lol.
