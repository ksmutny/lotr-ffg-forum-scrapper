Quick question about infighting

Does infighting basically get one monster of your choice attack another monster of your choice?  Does that count as the attack for the round for that monster?  It seems like a pretty powerful card for 1 lore chip which would basically get monsters to slaughter each other before they engage you.

Infighting does not make enemies engage in any sort of battle with one-another.

Infighting just transfers any current damage tokens from one enemy to another.

"Action: Move any number of damage from one enemy to another."

Cheers!

Infighting doesn't have enemies fight against each other. It just represents the idea that the enemies don't always work together. Mechanically, it allows you to shift some amount of damage from one enemy to put it on another.

As an example, you have a Hill Troll and a random Orc in the staging area. Gandalf enters play and does 4 damage to the Hill Troll. Both enemies remain in the staging area, but you have Dunhere. He can't attack for enough to break the Hill Troll's defenses, but he can put 2 damage counters on the Orc, so you do 2 damage to it. Infighting lets you move those 2 damage over to the Hill Troll. Play Gandalf again on the next turn, and you can kill it before it even gets out of the staging area.

Infighting is for moving those damage tokens to where they're most effective.

Had one scenario where my partner and I had ensnared a Marsh Adder, done quite a bit of damage to it, and then transferred it all (believe it was Carrock, so we transferred it to one of the trolls). Great card when there are high defense/hit point enemies that aren't immediately breathing down your neck.

Also can be incredibly useful if you are dealing with snipers/enemies who refuse to leave the staging area.
