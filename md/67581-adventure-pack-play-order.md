 Question from a new player. Is there a particular order I should play the Adventure packs?

I like to play them in order as they make for a (loosely but still) connected story but you can do it any way you like. I would at least stick to playing single cycle in order though.

For those who didn't know: below is the order the scenarios were released. As you can see; the 3rd scenario already has a high difficulty level, so you might not want to stay stuck on that one and refuse to play the others as long as you didn't pass that one.

Base game includes 3 scenarios:

 * Passage Through Mirkwood (Difficulty level = 1)
 * Journey Down the Anduin (DL= 4)
 * Escape from Dol Guldur (DL= 7)

Shadows of Mirkwood Cycle - Adventure Packs:

 * The Hunt for Gollum (DL= 4)
 * Conflict at the Carrock (DL= 7)
 * A Journey to Rhosgobel (DL= 6)
 * The Hills of Emyn Muil (DL= 4)
 * The Dead Marshes (DL= 5)
 * Return to Mirkwood (DL= 7)

Khazad-dûm Deluxe Expansions includes 3 scenarios:

 * Into the Pit (DL = 5)
 * The Seventh Level (DL = 3)
 * Flight from Moria (DL = 7)

Dwarrowdelf Cycle - Adventure Packs:
(The Khazad-dûm expansion is required to play the following adventure packs)

 * The Redhorn Gate (DL= 6)
 * Road to Rivendell (DL= 4)

It allso depend on what you are interested in.

One cycle normally does include cards that works well together, so it is nice to get whole cycle. If you are not going to get a lot of cards, then getting the base set, and Khazad-dum with one or two adventure packs that just have difficultu level that suits your plaing style is just fine. The combos that you could get are not so important if you are not playing competative! Just grab those big deluxe sets and look for the difficultu level of interesting adventure packs.
