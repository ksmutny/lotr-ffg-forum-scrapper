Hi.

I need a complete set of the Mirkwood cycle. Thought I'd wait for the reprints here in June. But I can see they have been delayed to Q3. Anyone know of a site still having anyone in stock?

Cool Stuff Inc. have a few copies of "A Journey To Rhosgobel" in stock as of today.

The rest seem to be extremely hard to find at the moment. I'm waiting for the reprints right now myself.
