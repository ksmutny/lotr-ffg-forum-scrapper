Seems good! Tactics Imrahil is appropiate and possible, which narrows the list of possible Flame of the West heroes again.

 

Ioreth at 0 cost is pretty **** great IMO. Also, I'm glad to see more of these minor ROTK characters in the game. Here's hoping for a Bergil ally in the cycle or in Flame of the West as well.

 

Justice Shall be Done is intriguing. Not sure how good, if any good, it will be in solo, but I'll try it for sure. Love the art and theme of that card! And that quote, yeah, pretty literal.

Looking forward to a Justice Shall Be Done "play all your cards on your team-mate and then die" deck. The recent Heed The Dream gives a reliable way of finding it if you can spare the leadership resources.

 

Edit: Bonus marks if your team-mate uses Message From Elrond to give you a second copy.

It looks so good :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

Really glad they have a great sea battle. If this quest will be fun will probably be a matter of how much you have to rely onto the objectives and how consistent they Show up. The spoiled ship enemy brings an objective into Play (guarding it) so it should be a managable Task to get at least some under Control. Looks like staying on Course will be key to be victorious (again).

 

Very cool Player Cards shown so far. Tactics Imrahil indeed seems to fit very well.

 

Knife-work should be good and give tactics important carddraw if you can activate it. Even if you "Just" kill 2 enemies you get 2 Cards it's ok (not great like daeron's runes or mithrandir's advice with 2/3 lore heroes), but for a sphere thath has so Little draw Options it  should do some work. Combine it with tactics Aragorn to get a -2 defense Advantage on your enemies and engage as much stuff as possible, 3-5 dead enemies don't seem too unlikely (depending on Player numbers, set-up etc.).

 

Ioreth Looks like a good healer. she fills the role of a situational healer "really" well, as 1 ressource for 3 HP is a great deal (warden of healing Needs 3 turns to be equally efficent without elrond). Only downside are her stats (REALLY BAD) it's not that she is a 0 in every Attribute, only 1 hitpoint is so weak against many AoE treacheries (even worse if you used her before questing :S)

 

Justice shall be done. Great concept. But then again they Limit it to once per deck. Even if I would Play a deck that could/would/wants to make use of it, It Needs luck or an Investment of ressources to grap justice consistently. Just having it Pop up randomly usually won't do you any good. Either you are winning and don't Need it or you will loose anyway. It is like the Fall of Gil-Galad you can't use it because you can't draw it most of the time. Very sad :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

Rajam, that's what I thought, too! At this point in the game, there are so many cards that can look at the top 5+ cards to help you get the exact cards you need, that limit-one cards are becoming much more viable. I can definitely see Justice Shall Be Done being a "win more" card, but I can also see it helping in many quests that tend to be most difficult near the end when the "boss" shows up, and of course, some treacheries/shadows can absolutely wreck a deck that is pretty much all set up just as you're nearing the end. Of course, it is probably the case that most games are lost before you get close to the end, so this card may not be of much help there.

Add Elf-friend to Aragorn and give him a Rivendell Blade so he's cutting through most enemies like a hot knife through butter

I am SO loving the quests in this cycle. I thought we would get Imrahil in the next saga box, but I agree he's a great fit here. Ioreth, Knife Work and And Justice Shall Be Done are dripping in theme. I probably will never play the last though.

I think you are definitely right as far as cards with the "Healer" trait go, but Silvan Tracker still packs a lot of healing punch in a Silvan deck.

From a pure numbers perspective, the Elves still win. They have 4 or 5, whereas Gondor still only has 2, one of which is unique. And I'm totally OK with unique characters being more powerful than universals.

Silvan Tracker is a good point - in the right deck he is absolutely obscene. I was thinking Noldor healers when I wrote that but admittedly didn't say it.

Just a hunch. Some people have been awaiting Tactics Imrahil, and this seems like a great opportunity to get him (we won't get him in Flame of the West unless he is Spirit, so there.)

Play with Elladan in the same line-up with Aragorn and you don't need elf friend and have the potential to take out more enemies with Elladan's readying effect. If you have a few nice combat allies out like Mithlond Sea Watcher, Marksman of Lorien, Legolas etc you could really clean up house with that extra -1 on top of Aragorn's -1 and for a few attacks with Elladan an additional -2 to enemy def and you would draw several cards at the same time. I think even with just 2 enemies killed and 2 cards drawn it is still very worth it as it isn't just drawing you the cards but also helping you destroy those enemies at the same time which is great in of itself. The 2 lore resources are a little harder to come up with or afford than the single tactics resource though but so long as you use this perhaps mid to late game it will hopefully be more affordable as well as more useful. Could be a great card for all those quests that reveal several encounter and/or enemy cards all at once when you progress to a certain quest stage. I think that includes quite a few quests to be honest!

I'm going to make proxies of Knife Work and try it out soon, I'll post about my experiences!

I really do think that it will be Imrahil in this pack as it is a perfect thematic choice and also continues along the trend we saw in Flight of the Stormcaller of providing us with Heroes that are also thematic for the next saga box (Denethor). By providing us with several heroes we would like to see in that saga box in this cycle instead it allows us to get so many more heroes that are thematically fitting for the next saga box by the time it comes out. I'm actually really happy and impressed they seem to be doing this as it means pretty much everyone is happy and we get all the various heroes we desire to use and or get for that saga box. Hopefully this means we do indeed see new versions of Eomer, Merry, Pippin, Elladan, Elrohir, Halbarad and Beregond!

The weird thing about Knife-work is that it seems like it's supposed to work with Aragorn (T), but really it just reduces the defense of the enemies engaged with you when you activate it.  Enemies that you engage after you activate it won't get an additional -1 Defense from Knife-work because of the most recent update in the FAQ about "lasting effects".

If you get more hit points to Ioreth, se becomes THE best healer of the game.

> If you get more hit points to Ioreth, se becomes THE best healer of the game.

 

I doubt she would be OP with 2 HP. Even though she is free, she constantly Drains ressources from you, if you use her every turn. 2nd She is unique so there can be only one.

While healing for 3 is a strong and useful effect, there often will be situations where the damage is splashed between your allies and not stacked on 1 target so warden of healing, silvan tracker etc. would still remain highly relevant. If you have 1 spare lore ressource per turn you aren't to far of to get multiple uses of a warden of healing, it is defenetly a slower Play as the warden costs 2 by himself, but the potential numbers arre much higher. Also a Group of 2 or even 3 wardens are insane. Lastly Ioreth might be the healing Card to Profit the least from Elrond, as healing 4 poits of damage is only usefull if you have a 5 HP character who is nearly dead, while boosting a healing of 1 up to 2 is much more useful (100% increase insted of 33%).

 

There are only few Scenarios in which you can't place damage in a way that other healers can't compete with Ioreth.

 

TL;DR: Ioreth with 2 Hp wouldn't be so strong that she would be the single best healer in the game.

Eh I don't know...

 

Warden of Healing when you have a bootload of lore resources and Elrond in play can heal a ****ton of damage in a single turn.

I just played a round during a game of Fate of Numenor in which I used two copies of Imladris Caregiver and loads of spirit resources to abuse a single copy of Elven light into healing 2 damage four times from any character (healing more or less all damage across the board accumulated till that point including a point of damage on one of the Caregivers) and also drawing me four cards as well. Because I did this during the planing phase I was able to play 3 of those four cards I drew that same phase (UC, Sailor of Lune and Silver Harp. I was able to do this as I had crazy stacked up resources because I was forced to discard many cards early/mid game due to nasty encounter effects).

This boost was just what I needed to get that deck started back up again and churning cards out faster and helped lead to a a victory.

Warden can heal more and across more characters so long as Elrond is in play or you use lore resources to get multiple uses in one turn.

Caregiver is not only a very decent healer and heals an equal amount to Ioreth with Elrond in play each turn but also helps boost the Noldor discard/draw engine overall as well.

Hell even Silvan Tracker is still better as it heals all Silvan characters which means if you are running a dedicated Silvan deck/s you have healing across the board for free every turn and with more than one in play or Elrond boosting them they will be absolutely more than enough for the rest of the game.

 

Ioreth, with or without more hitpoints, is in my opinion not even close to as good as some of the healing options we already have .

So in a four player game, could you use 3 copies of Message From Elrond to give one player, 3 more copies of Justice Shall be Done? A player could get 15 resources and 13 cards in one round.

## 26 [Network57 on May 14, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/219916-a-storm-on-cobas-haven/?do=findComment&comment=2217391)

Ioreth is amazing but super well-balanced. Being unique and requiring Lore resources, which are the most expensive resources in the game, it's a high cost for a 0-cost ally, but you do get a great effect. She can keep a hero from death better than other Healers, even Daughter of the Nimrodel who is a 3-coster. I'd definitely add her as a 1-of or 2-of in my mono-Lore decks. With enough card draw, you don't even have to swap her out. Adding a couple of her in a deck with Mithrandir's Advice and Daeron's Runes does almost nothing to dilute the deck, or even 3 copies if I'm running Protector of Lorien to ditch the extras.

She'd be pretty nice in my Gloin deck. Treebeard would probably appreciate Ioreth's assistance too.

If nothing else, Ioreth is great as a 0 cost ally to commit to sailing tests in a heavy card draw sphere. She's the only 0 cost unique ally, and that strikes me as pretty special considering we only have a one unique ally costing 1.

 

She is the cheapest ally target for Sword-Thain, which would enable her to use her ability once every round with her own resources. A guaranteed 3 damage healed every round (+ a last ditch undefended attack) seems like not a horrible deal for 2 cards and 4 resources, especially since if you didn't need the healing you just bank her lore income.

Did Ioreth actually do any healing in the book? Wasn't she just an old woman helping out and gossiping about The King's magic healing powers (which were just basic Elven skills that Elladan and Elrohir did on the quiet afterwards)?

Well, we never actually see a named character from Gondor do any healing in the Houses of Healing, so we don't really know, but she's the one that Aragorn asks about Athelas, so we might reasonably assume that she's a bit more eminent than general dogsbody.

## 31 [Network57 on May 14, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/219916-a-storm-on-cobas-haven/?do=findComment&comment=2217665)

Well she worked in the House of Healing and knew about the power of athelas, do I presume she was a healer. I'm only on Book IV on my current read-through of the canon and can't remember esoterica that well.

We know she worked in the houses of healing, but we do not know what her tasks were.  Here is the relevant passage:

---

Then an old wife, Ioreth, the eldest of the women who served in that house, looking on the fair face of Faramir, wept, for all the people loved him.  And she said: "Alas! if he should die.  Would that there were kings in Gondor, as there were once upon a time, they say!  For it is said in the old lore:  The hands of the king are the hands of a healer.  And so the rightful king could ever be known."

 

And Gandalf, who stood by, said: "Men may long remember your words, Ioreth!  For there is hope in them.  Maybe a king has indeed returned to Gondor, or have you not heard the strange tidings that have come to the City?"

 

"I have been too busy with this and that to head all the crying and shouting," she answered.  'All I hope is that those murdering devils do not come to this House and trouble the sick."

----

 

Gandalf when fetching Aragorn quotes her, naming her "wise-woman of Gondor."  When Aragorn arrives, he questions Ioreth directly about the stores of the herbs of healing.  She is the one who is sent to acquire kingsfoil, if there is any in the city, though it is Bergil who returns with the leaves.  I certainly get the impression that Ioreth's role in obtaining that is more significant than that of the herb-master.  Also, Ioreth speaks for the healers when she tells Aragorn "But we do our best in this House with what we have, as I am sure your lordship will know."

 

As for the healing performed by Gondorians, we find Aragorn directing the women to make water hot.  We find that Faramir's arrow wound has been tended and is healing.  Of Eowyn's broken arm, he states that "The arm that was broken has been tended with due skill, and it will mend in time."

 

After Aragorn's departure, the patients continue to improve, and Eowyn claimed to be healed in body (save her left arm) in just two days.  When complaining to Faramir, she says "It is not lack of care that grieves me.  No houses could be fairer, for those who desire to be healed."

 

In short, thematically it is reasonable both for the Warden to be an effective healing option and for Ioreth in particular to be a healer.

I guess another nice thing about Ioreth is that she's low-commitment. If you never need any healing, you haven't spent any resources, but she gives you the option of taking an undefended attack or tanking a big enemy if you find you need to.

I will probably think of her as a way to splash in emergency healing and let Warden of Healing continue to be the staple when it comes to repeatable healing.

Bingo. 3 damage is about the threshold where I start to get nervous about a hero taking too much damage too fast. If I had Ioreth down on the table I probably would be more willing to take the risk.

The spoiled cards are pretty meh imo.

 

Treebeard seems to like Ioreth, and that's about the only time I would use her.

 

Knife-work feels a bit underwhelming, and seriously...how often will you use that justice be done card effectively?

It's a fun idea, but if your game goes ok you shouldn't need it. And if you are losing in this game, you're usually going down badly.

This card will hardly save your skin, or the rest of the table me thinks.

In a deck presenting CS Aragorn and Faramir ally, Ioreth quests for 2 (I cannot imagine CS Aragorn without Narsil). Not bad for a 0-cost ally.

In an Outlands deck with Sword of Morthond attached, she's sick. A questing machine for just 1 resource, since healing is situational and one might not use her each turn for her effect. Warden might be better in the long game for healing purposes, but his healing modus operandi probably necessitates usage more often than Ioreth, ergo he's a worst candidate for the Sword than her. Plus, in an Outlands deck the 2 resources he costs to enter play are important, since he has to fight with the Herdsman, the Hunter and, if picked in deck-building, Gleowine, as to who will hit the table. Hirluin may pay for the first two of course, though wouldn't it be better if one had the opportunity to play a non-Lore Outlands ally, a Lore Outlands ally/Gleowine AND a healer in the same turn?

As for her art, it's one of the masterpieces in this game.

It's official: Ioreth is a GILF.

The spoiled cards look fun, and I'm looking forward to a major ship battle.

 

The Linhir Sea-captain, together with the second quest in Flame of the West, makes me think that at some point we'll get Angbor the fearless, lord of Lamedon, When the Grey Company and the Army of the Dead approached Linhir, all the Corsairs and Gondorians fled, except for Angbor. He gathered an army that marched to Minas Tirith, arriving shortly after Aragorn left for the Black Gate, and saw to the defense of the city.

 

I love the effect and especially the flavour text on Justice Shall Be Done, but I'm not a fan of the card name. It sounds triumphalist (and perhaps the art supports that interpretation), and its certainty ("Shall") doesn't fit with Tolkien's theme of eucatastrophe in the darkest moment. Listen to what Gandalf says at the last debate, shortly before the flavour text:

 

> His Eye is now straining towards us, blind almost to all else that is moving. So we must keep it. Therein lies all our hope. This, then, is my counsel. We have not the Ring. In wisdom or great folly it has been sent away to be destroyed, lest it destroy us. Without it we cannot by force defeat his force. But we must at all costs keep his Eye from his true peril. We cannot achieve victory by arms, but by arms we can give the Ring-bearer his only chance, frail though it be.
>  
> As Aragorn has begun, so we must go on. We must push Sauron to his last throw. We must call out his hidden strength, so that he shall empty his land. We must march out to meet him at once. We must make ourselves the bait, though his jaws should close on us. 
> ... 
> We must walk open-eyed into that trap, with courage, but small hope for ourselves. For, my lords, it may well prove that we ourselves shall perish utterly in a black battle far from the living lands; so that even if Barad-dûr be thrown down, we shall not live to see a new age. But this, I deem, is our duty.
> 
>  

 

Aragorn is not sacrificing himself and his army for victory, but instead for a slim chance of victory. "Justice Shall be Done" is too confident.
 
I realize this is a minor point, and I'm only making it because the designers are so consistently close to Tolkien's theme (for which they have my kudos!) that even minor departures stand out.

> If nothing else, Ioreth is great as a 0 cost ally to commit to sailing tests in a heavy card draw sphere. She's the only 0 cost unique ally, and that strikes me as pretty special considering we only have a one unique ally costing 1.

> She is the cheapest ally target for Sword-Thain, which would enable her to use her ability once every round with her own resources. A guaranteed 3 damage healed every round (+ a last ditch undefended attack) seems like not a horrible deal for 2 cards and 4 resources, especially since if you didn't need the healing you just bank her lore income.

 

I hadn't thought of this. Treebeard decks will get a huge boost. In a solo deck with Glorfindel and Elrond, you could use Stargazer to play Sword-thain with Vilya on Ioreth. At that point she lets Treebeard quest or attack to his full potential basically for free.

Estel, I like your take on JSBD, you seem well-versed in the Lore.

I remember during the first cycle, I was wondering if they ever make a 0-cost ally. I thought such an ally would be 0/0/0+1 with no ability. That would have been boring, I know, but at the time it also would have been a pretty good card as the 1-cost chumps were few.

The game has progressed much, and though the design team is doing much better job now (not releasing anything as easy-power as Steward or Courage), it also rarely releases poor cards. I know we got a super-chump Squire, and a 0-cost Hunter; however, here we have a 0-cost ally with an actual powerful ability (albeit for a cost).
