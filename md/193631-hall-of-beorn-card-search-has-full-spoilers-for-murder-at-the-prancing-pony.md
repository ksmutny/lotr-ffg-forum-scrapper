Having officially checked all the cards now, I now proclaim this quest being a-awesone, and most replayable stuff of the bunch to the current date! And seems pretty challenging too!

Looks really difficult in the threat department. Thank God we just got Favor of the Valar. Also, this has really cool theme and art. Wish we had a Wolf-pelt Jake hero!

Elfhelm and Strider's Paths are good cards for this szenario.

By the way, is it just me, or the hobbit guy is not looking at the bleeding guy, but somewhere to his side?

I didn't bring any copies of Thror's Map with me to the event, but I definitely could have used it. Thror's Key, too.

Thror would have been good at murder mysteries.

The illustrations are amazing, specially the greenway footpad.
