Polish Hills will be released on nearest Wednesday. This is official as per polish publisher. We do not get expansions before other countries, so the worldwide release is really coming :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] And yes, the date is reliable since so far polish publisher was always accurate.

Perfect!  That should give me just enough time to finish building the new PC before Emyn Muil hits retailers.

That's true. I've already bought it in a prrelease event.

The new hero is Brand, son of Bain( tactics)

There is new song

The scenario is very different from the ones we had before

Could you please tell us more details of the Hero and the player cards please?

 I was not expecting the King of Dale, but I like it.  It sounds like the song for the spirit sphere has finally arrived as well.

I can write you some information about the cards, however i am not used to english lotr lcg terminology, so I may misstranslate something.

brand stats

10 Threat cost

2 willpower

3 strenghth

2 defence

3hit points

Ranged / distance ? ability

and response ability for multiplayer

 

I have already mentioned the song

Leadership

a Tuk Ally with an interesting Response And Action Ability, that together help you to control the next card in each player deck. The cost is only 2. Ihmo very useful in multiplayer.

event card( cost 1)

Lore

Gildor Inglorion gives you great control over the coming deck cards.

Event card ( cost3)

Spirit

Best ridermarch horses and event card both are about putting progress Tokens - useful in emyn muil scenario

 

Tactics

Two new cards for Eagle Deck. Ally and event. The event card is very powerful. It's cost is 0 and it has really great synergy with Eagles That have Response, that has something to do entering and leaving play.

Difficulty level is 4

There is only one quest card ( but it really makes sense)

Plenty of location cards ( we have search for Gollum in different places)

3 Enemies

and trecheries

Awesome. We've only played with the core set so far, and have been waiting for several card packs to come out before trying the game again. Hopefully with Hills out it will give us enough cards per deck that it doesn't feel as repetitive.

Great, thank you! Can you say more about the quest? Which encounter decks are used? Can you write what is written on the only quest card? (rules on both sides)

## 13 [Glaurung on September 25, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53650-hills-release-date-28092011/?do=findComment&comment=532810)

Difficult 4??? Really bad..........  i has scare that And i got that.  Why?????

We have so cool Quests before : Carrock 7, Rhosgobel 6, Osgiliath 8 or 9 and now got back to 4????

Can be really boring now to play Emyn Muil after previous quests. Lets hope it will be better than HFG otherwise i will pass to buy this one.

But i need new players cards so i need to buy anyway. ......HMmmm....Ok we with my friend by 1 instead 2. 

## 14 [lleimmoen on September 25, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53650-hills-release-date-28092011/?do=findComment&comment=532824)

Glaurung, be sensible. There are people that struggle with Mirkwood. They need easier quests. And even the most skilled and experienced players can lose against a difficulty 4 quest, just draw the money grabing treachery during the set up of the Hunt and it will be tough to take it from there. So, I think it is perfectly reasonable that there are also "easier" quests. Although I think the levels are redundant. They should not mention them at all 'cause it really depends on many factors.

As for the new cards, can someone spill a bit more beans? What is Brand's trait? A Barding?

Asertus, your translation is perfectly fine, can you tell us about the response of Brand? And some more details of the cards you mentioned? If you find time and interest, of course. Thanks a bunch already!

And Matthew, where the Mordor are the Elves?

Difficulty 4 may mean "impossible to win" if the quest nails your perfect deck weakness.

And Gildor Inglorion? So we get an Elf, awesomeness, and one of my favourite, too. What is his card exactly like?

Well we get Gildor at least! I wonder what his ability is and who does the picture. I hope Magali since she's the queen of the elves!

I'm actually really excited about Brand. I know it's not an elf but we can still hope for Return to Mirkwood...

I also want to see more Elfs. But Brand is ok. If he is a archer maybe his ability like Dunhere???? Can attack Enemies on staging area??

Or maybe i will be to powerful??? (2 heroes can attack staging area).

Maybe you should add this card into all your encounter decks in order to raise the difficulty level to be more appealing to you?

He could still get rid of Sauron with Denethor. Too easy for him^^ gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]

Is there really no more news since yesterday? Argh.

As for the Sauron card, it is only good Denethor could finally gain some edge over Sauron.

He could just postpone him, thats all.

I barely ever run through the whole encounter deck.

Anyways, I would be more interested in the Hills of Emyn Muil news...

I'm very glad the scenario will be difficulty 4.  I have a feeling when the tournament structure comes around, most of the scenarios will be fairly low difficulty to encourage short rounds and prevent the marathon tournaments I've seen out there.  Compare combined round scores at the end and you have a winner.

The current scoring system does not function in the slightest.  Meaningful tournaments are not possible unless the entire system is reconceived.  thus far, no one has been able to propose a model that would make the competitive, much less fun. As such, tournament play can't be factor in determining the distribution of the games difficulty curve.

Well, now we got the new hero.  I don't like the card art sad.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sad.gif]

And his willpower is again a bit up...

I agree. His outfit looks like someone's cheap ren-faire costume, that they just had their mom sew...

Agreed, his card art is among the worst so far (next to Hill Troll, Self Preservation, Rain of Arrows and Second Breakfast)

It would not be right perhaps to have only cool looks like Henamarth Riverson, Legolas or Eleanor. We need some that look a bit ridiculous, too. I still respect the artwork, even though the garment looks like it has been made in the 1980's.
