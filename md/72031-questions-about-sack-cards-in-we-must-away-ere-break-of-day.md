Ok, I'm playing the 1st Saga quest (We Must Away, Ere Break of Day).  Troll Camp is in play (which reads: "While Troll Camp is in play, Bilbo Baggins gains: "Action: Exhaust Bilbo Baggins and spend 1[baggins] resource to remove 1 Sack card from a character. Bilbo Baggins may trigger this effect even with a Sack card attached to him.")

Bilbo Baggins is exhausted when he is sacked (which reads: "Attached character cannot ready, attack, defend, commit to quests, or trigger effects."  So this would be a static situation where Bilbo is not able to remove any sack (as he cannot be readied again to be exhausted to trigger this effect), correct?

Another related question, Dain Ironfoot has a constant effect which gives +1 boost to attack and willpower to drawf characters when he is ready.  If Dain is sacked, this ability is not canceled because it is not considered triggering an effect, correct?

Thanks Muemakan for the prompt answer.  I take it as "Yes to both questions"?

 I would say yes to both.

 (assuming Dain is ready when he gets the Sack put on him)

Oh thank you for the replies.  And yes, Dain is ready, as always, when he is Sacked.

I guess "to trigger effects" means Actions and Responses. So everything without those words should work^^ (Lore Bilbo [if he could participate] for example)
