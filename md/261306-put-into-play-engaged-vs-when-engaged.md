If you "put into play, engaged" an enemy, do you trigger his "when you engage this enemy" effects?

 

For example, Pack Hunters [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Pack-Hunters-TWoEN] ("Forced: When you engage Pack Hunters, search the top 5 cards of the encounter deck for a Warg enemy, and put it into play engaged with you"): You engage one, search the deck for an enemy, and you only find another Pack Hunters. You put this second Pack Hunters into play engaged... do you have to trigger his "when you engage Pack Hunters" effect again?

Whenever you engage an enemy you must do the "when engaged" effects.  Put into play engaged is engaging, so you would do the effect again.

Yep, sadly it seems that Wargs are often encountered in packs!

It is really hard to face an enemy without having engaging him at any way. The only way I see is to make him start on your zone as something else that an enemy (a hidden card on blood of gondor, potentially some cards that turn a character into enemy on cycle 5). Otherwise there is always a mutual engagement (good for lopippin, bad in this case ^^).

I think even hidden cards and allies-to-enemies will still count as engaging you.

Depends what you mean by "face". I think the examples you mentioned still count as engaging you.

The only way you can avoid engagement effects and still get rid of enemies is to deal with them while they're in the staging area. Dunhere, Hands Upon the Bow, Hunting Party etc.
