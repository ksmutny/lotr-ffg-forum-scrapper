# [Song of Wisdom + Burning Brand?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/51362-song-of-wisdom-burning-brand/)

What do you think? Is a Hero with an attached Song of Wisdom (gives Lore resource icon) eligible for Burning Brand (which is only playable on a Lore Hero). In our recent games we did play it that way but 'Im not sure if we did it right.

I have wondered and asked the same. And I have been told it is possible this way. But I am still uncertain the wording makes that clear. I believe, from the game design, it is true though. The inclusion of the cards in one adventure pack also makes one thing it is the case. Finally, it certainly gives A Burning Brand more meaning to play.

I think that it is correct.

A song (Kings, Wisdom) gives a hero "a new sphere colour". So you can pay with your new sphere (i.e. a Tactics hero with Song of Wisdom) the cost of A Burning Brand (hence you pass the Resource Match -page 12 of LOTR rules, phase 2 - ) and put it in a Lore hero (the Tactics hero of the example above is now a Tactics/Lore hero, so he can use it).

I agree that you can play it on a hero with Song of Wisdom since it give that characte a Lore icon. That's interesting having it restricted to Lore characters which restricts it but having it be able to be played on characters and not just heroes adds some flexibility. Now we just need a really good defending ally for Lore! Like an Ent!?!

Haldir was previewed. He is very good. Ally, cost 4, will 2, attack 2, defense 2, hp 3. Ranged. Sentinel.

But Ents, now that would/could be super good. Thematically though, they were quite passive during the lifespan; however, things cannot be taken too strictly, I believe.

If Ents ever show up as ally cards in the future I guess you'll have to pay resources each time you want to refresh them in order to reflect their "slowness"

I posted this on the Cardboard of the Rings site, but I'll repost here so everyone can consider the following:

*  Rulebook page 8, regarding the symbol on the bottom left of a hero card, states “Resource Icon: Found only on hero cards, these icons indicate the sphere(s) of influence to which resource tokens in this hero’s resource pool belong. They also indicate to which sphere(s) the hero card itself belongs.”

 * Song of Wisdom states, “Attached hero gains a [Lore] resource icon.”

* A Burning Brand states, “Attach to a [Lore] character.”

Given that a Leadership character such as Aragorn belongs to the Leadership sphere only because he has a Leadership resource icon, if you were to grant him another resource icon, Lore (through Song of Wisdom), he would in turn belong to the Lore sphere as well, thus becoming a Leadership/Lore character and therefore an eligible target for A Burning Brand. Likewise, his resources would also belong to both spheres, so he could be the hero with the resource match used to pay for A Burning Brand.

What if you later lose the Song of Wisdom?

Discard A Burning Brand, or is the restriction applicable only "when you play" the card, and not afterward?

Another question for the FAQ :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]. The logical thought would be that, losing the traitment of Lore sphere (and the main one), he loses a lore-only attachment. But the description in card is ambiguous, because the card has already been attached :S.

Yeah, that would be neat. Although you do the same in case of keeping the Winged Guardian and there you can hardly call it "slowness", haha.

I for one would think you keep A Burning Brand. I believe the requirement only applies when you attach it.

 I'm going to throw in another vote for the "once A Burning Brand is attached, it stays attached regardless of whether the character ends up losing their Lore resource icon" camp.

 Well I have found two sources that back up everyone's conclusions that attachments stay attached once meeting the initial attachment criterion.  Both answers were in reference to the forest snared enemy going back to the staging area. Do a search on Forest Snare.

 Now we should find out if there will ever be a Title attachment made turning a person into a Dwarf, would Dwarven Axe still get its plus 2 bump after discarding the title attachment?

If Eomund used his ability would a character who lost their Neither am I a Stranger attachment the previous turn ready themselves?  I don't think they would because they no longer have the Rohan trait.

@ Kiwina:

They would not ready.  I take "attached character gains the Rohan trait," to mean that so long as it is attached, that character will have the Rohan trait.

I suppose someone could argue that the opposite, because the card does not specifically say "gains the Rohan trait permanently," or "gains the Rohan trait only so long as Nor Am I a Stranger" remains attached, but I think thats awfully nit-picky.

 You should be able to determine what Traits a character has by looking at the game state.  You shouldn't have to remember "this dude has the Rohan trait because he had an attachment giving it to him at one time but now it's gone and we're just all remembering that it used to be there."

Similarly, the Dwarven Axe attachment is essentially continually checking to see if someone is a Dwarf, it can't remember if a character used to be a Dwarf, it can only see the cards currently in play to make that determination.

I am not sure if we understand this differently but I think there is an important difference between A Burning Brand and Dwarven Axe. The former's requirement applies when attaching it, whilst the latter's bonus applies any time. So I conclude that you only need a Lore hero when you play A Burning Brand but you only get the bonus out of Dwarven Axe when attached hero is a Dwarf. This will probably never happen but if there were a card giving a Dwarf trait which the hero would have later lost, he would not longer be getting the +2 but only +1 instead. Does that make sense?

That's also how it's ruled in the CoC LCG.

Also, cards in CoC have no memory, i.e. if the attachment is no longer attached to a character, all of its effects are gone as well.

I agree.  If we're looking at A Burning Brand that is attached to a hero without a Lore icon, we've got to assume that he had one when the attachment was played, and so there is no problem.
