Yes, especially if you are talking about Celador and Ithilien Guardian from the Into Ithilien quest. BUT... most Objective Allies have texts on them saying, "The first player gains control of . . . " so there's usually always clear instructions on what to do.

Does that help, what card were you specifically wondering about??
