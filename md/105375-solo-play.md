This is my first LCG (or similar card game system), so please forgive my newbie-ish questions!

 

I purchased this game for the reviews that said it was outstanding solo game.  I have just the core set.

However, I am a bit confused.  Do I setup the game like I have 2 players and run back and forth between the two?  Or do I put 6 heroes out in front of me and shuffle all their decks together?  

 

And a general question, if I pay resources to put a card in play, do I have to pay again to exhaust it?  I do I just tilt, when I use it?

 

I have read the rules, downloaded a cheat sheet from orderofthegamers.com and watched the tutorial (which was incredibly helpful).  Are there any other resources that might help me out?  I think in some cases I might be over-thinking it!

Officially in solo play you play with 3 heroes and one deck. (The encounter deck draws 1 card per player which is how the game scales).

You can choose to run 6 heroes and two decks if you want it to be closer to the 2 player game. In this case you keep the decks separate, they have separate hands and resources.


You pay the cost to put the card in play - exhausting doesn't cost extra unless the card says so, you just tilt the card to show it's used.

I knew I was probably over-thinking it!  Thanks!!

I wonder how are you still thinking you need to pay the resources to exhaust something after reading rulebook and watching tutorial...

The purpose of this thread was to answer a question. To someone who is new. And is new to LCG games. I wonder how you are still thinking that this is the proper answer to the question after reading the first post and watching Rapier's answer...

I don't think it's a proper answer, because it never meant to be. It's a question, if you haven't happen to notice.

 

It just does not compute: In the tutorial and in the rulebook, it's clear you don't need to pay anything when you exhaust. It just can't be more clear, no matter how new or new to LCG games you are.
