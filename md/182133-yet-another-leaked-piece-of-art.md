# [Yet another leaked piece of art](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/182133-yet-another-leaked-piece-of-art/)

Owing to my seeming reputation of revealer of artwork, I just found yet another piece from Giacobino's facebook page:

 

11138654_660396124062503_607911778614168 [https://scontent-gru1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xat1/v/t1.0-9/11138654_660396124062503_6079117786141682709_n.jpg?oh=970f36825a34848cb8bb55b268221bde&amp;oe=561DC35B]

 

 

According to the artist this is Dori depicted here. Now, considering the fact that he's holding that helm and bearing that axe this looks to me like a tactics hero, and I suspect it will be the "defensive" hero in Across the Ettenmoors. What do you think?

A defensive dwarf, and another tactics dwarf option, would be most welcome.  Dain is currently the only strong defensive option, and it's best to keep him ready.

This would be fantastic! Big fan of Giacobino's work in this game.

This art is perfection. He looks like he is readying for the Battle of the Five Armies.

Might also be an art for some attachment, like "Helmet", o some event, like "Gear Up!".

I was thinking something similar. It seems to feature the gear pretty prominently.

It's the Golden Helmet of Mambrino:

Cost 2

Attachment

Exhaust Golden Helmet of Mambrino to search your deck for a Song card and add it to your hand.

Very good find, and excellent art.

 

Though I rarely play Dwarves, I'm sure Dwarf-lovers out there must be a bit frustrated considering the trait have not seen so much love since the Dwarrowdelf / The Hobbit expansions, back in 2012 and early 2013.

 

I wouldn't have said that a while ago but now I think most of the traits have a decent pool of heroes and a Dwarf hero would not be too outraging.

I doubt it. Not only does this artist make mainly art for heroes, but he said the piece is titled "Dori", as if in a hero card, plus IMO this does not feature the gear enough for an attachment, the focus is clearly on the character here.

Well, I won't be surprised at all if it's indeed going to be a hero, but I've seen plenty of card art titled with something like a name or a title, which was actually used for events.

 

UPDATE:

 

Here is a couple of shiny examples:

Both named as if they were supposed to be allies, both ended up being events.

It always bothered me that among dwarfs, famous armor smiths and armor wielders, was highest defense stat 2 (with exception of Dain of course). If I should imagine somebody being able to withstand a blow without being damaged it would be some stout dwarf in full plate armor. Really hoping for Dori defensive hero. (Even his allyversion is somewhat defensive - beeing able to save another guy from damage).

 

And he looks Well-Equipped. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

 

And nice find Gizlivadi.

Even though I think this will be a character card, I can add another example: I thought the art on Don't Be Hasty! (which I also revealed in this forum) was going to be an ent ally.

 

The only difference though, is that Giacobino was commissioned to specifically illustrate Dori. If this was going to be an event or attachment that featured a generic dwarf, they wouldn't have asked him to paint "Dori". Your examples makes sense because they're generic gondorians and rangers, not to mention that those arts you showed are not really focused on the characters but on what's happening in the art, as well as the enemies (similar to Revealed in Wrath, also an event most likely), so it makes sense they're events. This art, on the other hand, is clearly focused on the character, so to me it screams character card. I'm obviously not certain of this, as none of us is, but I would bet this will be a hero art. It just doesn't feel like an event at all. It's like looking at the art on hero Haldir and saying that this is an event called "Explore" or "Haldir's bow". Again, not impossible, but highly unlikely.

Magali has a bunch of pieces of art named Glorfindel and only one of them is a character card so there's no way to be 100% certain.

I guess we'll just have to wait. I still think this will be a hero Dori though.

I would be happy to see a Dori hero and this also seems to be the most logical expectation given the name of the artwork. Still, Epi Lepi makes a very good point. The artwork for Valiant Warrior was titled Glorfindel. It certainly shows Glorfindel, does not look like an attachment at all but actually is one: http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Valiant-Warrior-TBR [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Valiant-Warrior-TBR]

 

Edit: Anyway, I am with Gizlivadi on this one. Let's hope for a strong defensive Dwarf hero. :-)

I don't have it in immediate reach, but I saw plenty of LotR LCG art with titled characters, like Elrond or Glorfindel, which then was used for attachments and events. As for focus - for you this art focuses on dwarf, for me it focuses on what the dwarf is doing. It's the matter of prespective. And I disagree with you about Haldir. Unlike this Dori, who actively puts his armor on, Haldir does literally nothing.

It's not really that subjective, John. There's a reason professional illustrators actually study stuff and have a series of rules for composition and illustration. A piece like the one I revealed last time, for example, will most likely not end up as a character card, considering that its focus is not really just on Glorfindel, but on the Nazgul getting swept away and the whole situation the image is depicting, hence the assumption it will be an event (not to mention its title). Haldir, as you said, is really doing very little on the art, rather just "looking cool". The art is clearly just meant to focus on the character posing. This is a very similar piece of art. Sure, he's putting on a helmet so you could assume it will be a helmet attachment, but then again, Erkenbrand is charging forward on his horse and the art ended up in a hero card, not a mount attachment or an event. Both arts still have one main element, that is, the character. And finally, it really doesn't matter in this case if Magali drew Glorfindel in a number of pieces and called them Glorfindel. That's her. Giacobino, on the other hand, always tends to post his hero art before release and title it as the character that's depicted. It happened with Haldir, Mablung and Aragorn. Those arts were all called by those names and ended up being heroes, so considering the antecedents of this particular artist, this will most likely be the art for a hero card.

There is absolutely no way we can know either way at this point, so let's just wait and see. The art is amazing, whatever card it's going on.

Regarding the possible hero I think this art will be in, I'm really looking forward to a new tactics Dwarf for sure. A defensive tactics hero in a dwarf deck would be very powerful even in solo if you're going with the optimal leadership heroes, Dain and Thorin. Thorin quests and/or attacks while Dori defends. That could be very powerful with all the resource acceleration and attachments like Ring-mail, events like Foe Hammer with all the axes, Erebor Battle Master, etc. But the thing is that in solo the other tactics Dwarf heroes are either risky with the high starting threat (Gimli) or are totally useless in the current meta (Thalin). A low or low-ish threat Dwarf tactics hero would be an incredible addition to the Dwarf archetype.

I'm looking forward to a Tactics Dwarf hero because currently we have only 2, so you can't play MonoTactics Dwarves.

Would be awesome! Dain Gloin and Bifur for player 1 and Gimli Dori(9 starting threat with 3 def, 1 wp and 1 att and 4 hp.) and Nori for player two. Great. Might want to switch something around and get hero Gimli out for the ally but it sounds great.

I love me some Dwarves.

If I am counting correctly, and if this is indeed a Dori hero, the only dwarf left from The Hobbit that we don't have in hero form (and who is still alive) is Bofur, right?
