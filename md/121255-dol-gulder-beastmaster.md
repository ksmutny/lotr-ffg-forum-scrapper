I think I know the answer to this, but I just want to check and that will aid my understanding of the game mechanics, so apologies in advance.

 

His Forced effect is an extra shadow card when he attacks. I assume this is every time he attacks and not just the first time.

 

Am I correct?

 

Again apologies, but it really will help my overall understanding.

Yes. The additional shadow card is dealt when the Dol Guldur Beastmaster is chosen during step 1 of enemy 

attack resolution.
