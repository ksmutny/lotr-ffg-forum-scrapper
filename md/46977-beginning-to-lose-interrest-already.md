So I love the concept. What is killing me is having to constantly build a new deck. It is tedious!!!!!

I have built a deck that can win with regularity doing the Passage through Murkwood solo quest. I thought it was an accomplishment. So I take it against Journey Down the Anduin... FML!!!

I am all for Minor tweeks to a deck. A Side Board if you will. But to have to constantly completely change your deck is a pain in the ass. Again tedious.

Then add into it the multiplayer aspect. Again I would expect minor tweeks. But when changing out your heroes completely changes what you need in your deck and causes you to have to rebuild the whole thing....TEDIOUS.

So lets flash forward to when we have 6 Adventure packs out. A ton of cards that we now have to weed through. More things we have to take into consideration.

As it Stands, for me IMO, I need to have a minimum of 4 decks. That is a lot of cards I need to buy. To me it is not worth the hassle.

Maybe it is because of the lack of resources that we have to do this. Maybe things will become more standardized when we have more cards. I don't know.

I know I am going to get a lot of flack from fanboys. Screw you guys right off the bat. What I could use is some encouragement and maybe some empathy. Hell show me the error of my ways and make me love this game again.

When it comes to multi-player, I completely understand you.  There just are not enough heroes in the game to be able to "swap out" certain heroes without having to make major changes to your deck.

My son and I have made a handful of "custom" heroes that we've tossed into decks for the games that we play.  So far, we've made Halbarad, Boromir, and Faramir.  We have plans for Galadriel, Celeborn, and Elrond.  That has been a really fun thing to do to keep our interest high while we wait for the month and a half (ugh! that is  along time) until The Hunt for Gollum finally arrives.  

The low number of heroes is my biggest complaint so far.  But rather than actually complain about it, I "fixed" the problem myself (with the help of my son).

As for needing large numbers of cards, yes, you do need a lot of cards.  My son and I have 2 core sets.  With those, we are able to build decent pairs of decks.  It was expensive, but it was worth it.  We've pulled out all the less useful cards (Gandalf's Search), made lists of the best core cards from each sphere, and can grab 15 player cards for each hero, 3 Gandalfs, and a couple extra cards and put them in a deck without too much effort.  Sleeving them is tedious, I suppose, but we're used to trading card games, so we're kind of used to it.

If you have only 2 decks that you need to make, then you could just write the decklists out, assemble them each as best you can, and then swap the cards that are in both decks between games.  If this is still too tedious, then buy another copy of the core set.  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Last advice: take some time off.  It is fun to have a few games to rotate between so that you don't get bored.  My son and I have SEVERAL games we like to play.

 honestly: I suggest to you to leave the game be until the adventure pack comes out... buy one, then play the game again and if you still don't like it... sell it 

normally you shouldn't be building decks for each scenario... if playing with 2 players or more, the game is totally feasible! solo mode is another thing... but 2-4 players? it's fun - the cooperation is a vital part, talking, discussing, banding together - you can always combine it with some nice cooking, drinking, etc :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

I agree with OP I have beat the 1st scenario solo and with 2 players, beat 2nd with 2 players and 3rd with 3 players. Then I lost interest. But once the adventure packs start rolling out I expect it to get better. Right now I am trying to see if I can get a store to do the Hunt for Gollum preview event.

I'll definitely agree that deconstructing and reconstructing decks is pretty tedious, even though I have lists made and printed out for what cards go into which decks.  Sometimes I find it being a lot less work to just not play single player, because then I'd have to disassemble my two dual-sphere decks that I use for 2 player games just to put together my single player deck... so I can empathize with the tedium there, and sometimes I just don't have the energy to go to all that effort just for a couple of solo games, because then I would have to remake the original two decks when I was done... blarg.  Since I use a color-coded organization system on top of things, that adds to some of the tedium from another layer of organization on top of what one would normally do.  Or actually, it probably makes things a lot easier (since cards are simple to find).

I've played a few single player games against the first scenario, but I haven't gotten around to playing the 2nd or 3rd solo yet, because of not knowing when my 2nd player will feel like playing, and wanting to have the decks ready to go at, more or less, a moment's notice.  And, if that person doesn't feel like playing, I normally don't have the attention span or energy to drop everything and swap out a ton of cards to play single player.  I've enjoyed the game immensely with two players, and I probably enjoy reading and writing about the game just as much as playing it, but I haven't had the free time to divert much attention or energy toward single player.  Working two jobs probably doesn't help with that.  I wish I knew enough interested people to get some 3 or 4 player games going, though, that would be great to try out and decks could be as easy as "okay, you get 3 copies of every Spirit card, you get 3 copies of every Lore card..." etc, making reconstruction a little quicker.

This is my first coop card game and my first question in those forums was how a coop game can keep your interest.Most people told me that deckbuilding and different combo of heroes can keep my interest but after 1 month i can say that this doesn't work.Maybe it is me maybe coop games are not my style but if this game wasn't Lotr you could see my box on ebay.

Maybe if FFG will give us the option to play as the shadow player can bring more people (especialy those who like competitive games) and make this game a little more intresting than just play the same scenarios over and over again.

I hope AP will make the game more interesting cause i want to have a good Lotr game to play.

Try playing "two-handed solo" - play like a two-player game, but with yourself controlling each deck.

Two-player is clearly what the game is balanced for.  Beating any scenario beyond the first in solo play requires a precisely made deck, a lot of luck, or both. They should have said in the rulebook that 1 player is especially challenging, but oh well. All scenarios are doable in two-player with the default decks, though you should at least add the extra Gandalfs. That doesn't mean you'll always win, but if you play well you have a decent chance, and bad luck doesn't hit you as hard because you have more options to deal with it.

So just simluate two players with one player, I prefer it over "real" solo play. Though actually having two players is even better of course.

Since each scenario seems to require a different build to defeat it, it does require a lot of deconstruction. But if you can find 2 good combinations (one that works for Mirkwood, and one that works for Anduin or Escape) then you'd cut down on your rebuilding time. I think the fact that there's no one "best" combination for all 3 scenarios is both a plus and a minus.

Thank you so much guys. I really appreciate the Support and it was encouraging to hear I was not the only having these thoughts. I have become a huge fan of Co-Op and Single player games. That is what drew me to LotR.

Your suggestions are great and encouraging. Especially playing 2-handed. I think this is the direction I will take.

I too am waiting for Golum. I really look forward to playing again. You guys have given me a new direction to go.  Thanks again!

it would be awesome to finally be able to play the "bad" side in future expansions... as in Middle Earth: The Lidless Eye... it was SO COOL being able to play a Nazgul and fighting against Gandalf, etc. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] Maybe the encounter deck will consist of the "good guys" then :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] or to actually play the encounter deck actively against a coop-team (same as in WOW TCG Onyxia's raid, where one player is a super-crass dragon who wants to kill them all and the players have to defeat him...) or maybe 2-bad guys vs. two good guys... there's potential!

It sounds like you might have just played too much, try pacing yourself. I haven't even played the 3rd scenario yet! Anytime we put a lot of expectations on something, it's bound to not live up to them and so there's an initial "let down" feeling.  It seems like you guys don't really enjoy cooperation. There's a buzz I get just from helping a friend out when they're in trouble that makes coop exciting. If I was playing solo all the time I would definitely get bored. At first I was woried that with more players the game would be too easy but I found the 2nd scenario to be tough with three players.

I agree that deckbuilding is somewhat limited right now. To make a duel sphere deck I basically use the whole deck of the sphere I have two heroes with, and half of the deck of the other sphere. Once the expansions come out we'll have to start making some choices as to what's in our deck. Hang in there guys!

I've only had the game for a week and I've played maybe 12 solo games and 1 co-op. Most of the games were learning from mistakes as was the co-op attempt. I finally got the rules down and enjoyed a few solo games afterward. I might be lame, but I've still only attempted the first scenario and made all kinds of mistakes with Leadership and Tactics sphere (the first ones I was trying with) and I had a tough time with the first scenario. Then I figured stuff out and got through it with Spirit and Lore. Before I move onto the second scenario, I want to get through the first with Tactics and Leadership.

The game is kind of addicting and being able to play solo made it easy to get a lot of games in. So I've decided to slow it down before it gets stale for me, especially since the Adventure Packs are behind schedule and there's no rush for me to accomplish everything and then sit and wait for the future cards. I'm just going to pace myself and make it last.

I got a game called Summer Wars (by Plaid Hat Games) for my nephew a couple years ago for his birthday. It's a deckbuilding game that's mostly a 2 player game but can be played with 3 or 4. Well at the beginning there were only a couple core sets and four factions, so there was only so many plays in it before you did all you can do before it got stale. The game took off and is really good, so now they have had many more factions available and I have picked up a couple more faction decks plus some reinforcement packs for the original core sets and some mercenary cards that can be mixed with any faction. In June, they will have a master set out with 6 more factions. There's 2 more I don't have so all together there will be 14 faction decks, mercenaries and reinforcements. So now that I have kind of put the game down for a while, I've started getting back into it as there has been so many other cool releases that I was able to and will be able to get to add to the diversity and replayability of the game. So that's kind of something that I can see with LOTR the card game in a way. I will slow-play the core set and when they release a bunch of other stuff, I'll likely buy a bunch of them at once to keep me going for a good stretch.

I think that not spending a ton of time actually playing the game has definitely helped me not to get sick of it yet, despite constantly checking this forum, the Boardgamegeek forums, FFG's main page for news updates, listening the Cardboard of the Rings podcast, and writing a way, way too long review for this game on Amazon. I played the first scenario a lot of times before the second, and I played the second a few times before the third, so in that way I feel like I "paced myself" pretty well, and I didn't rush the experience, just took some time to "savor it," if you want to call it that. Apart from the solid gameplay and the incredible hype for a very alluring theme, I think the other aspect of playing this game that I've enjoyed the most is that my 2nd player has never really played any strategy game before, and teaching someone literally new to gaming and this genre in particular how to play has been a great experience. Seeing another person slowly start to grasp the concepts of how the game works, and eventually get to the point where they can talk about the pros and cons of including or excluding certain cards from their deck has been very awesome, and I love seeing their understanding become clearer with each game.


Deck building is definitely limited at the moment, and for me most of the choices seem pretty obvious. For two players, I did a 2/3 Leadership 1/3 Tactics deck, and a 2/3 Spirit 1/3 Lore deck. To make them, I basically thought about what cards were the best from every sphere, included those, and then supplemented with other cards to reach the minimum of 50. Without doing an exhaustive deck list, I think this has allowed me to take advantage of the best cards and combinations that every sphere has to offer, and I honestly don't feel like I'm making any sacrifices by having to leave certain cards out. One deck is primarily for tanking, the other is for utility and questing. When the utility deck needs extra resources, the tanking deck hands them over. When the tanking deck needs to draw extra cards, the utility deck facilitates that. The tanking deck deals with creatures extraordinarily well, and the utility deck almost exclusively handles questing and exploring locations with the assistance of the fantastic Legolas from the tanking deck.


I've probably limited myself somewhat by not trying a lot of different hero combinations, but what I've gotten into the habit of using has worked extraordinarily well so far, and has been able to reliably beat all three scenarios. Still though, I find myself making small changes to the decks despite our limited pool of cards at the moment, and I don't think I've hit "perfection" quite yet. All I can really say though is that I'm beyond excited for the first adventure pack... late June feels so far away, but I'm sure once we get into the habit of receiving new cards each month, 4 weeks might not seem that long to wait. I have high hopes that this will become my hands-down favorite game, and here's hoping that FFG does not disappoint!

I totally agree. While my 15 year-old nephew isn't new to gaming, he loves LOTR and the one attempt at co-op was when I had a chance to teach him and it was so cool and rewarding to see him get into it. I enjoy teaching my girls games as well and see their excitement grow as they understand the game more and can pull off a cool move or whatever. For me, as much as anything, the biggest part of my enjoyment in gaming is just spending time with my family or friends, and then reminiscing about some memorable event during a game even if it was a week or month ago.

I have similar concerns with it slowing down as well.

I find the problem is the event deck.  Imagine you played MTG, but every game was against the same opponent with the same deck.  AGOT where your opponent played the same deck without changing a card.

Then each month, they get some new cards, make a new deck, then play that repeatedly until another month passes.
I can see it becoming a fringe game in our group, mainly because the challenge in other games is a live opponent making tactical and strategic decisions.  That part is missing from the event deck.  All choice has been removed from it.  There is no battle of wills.  I know what cards are in the event deck after a couple of plays and start mitigating against possible negative events before they happen.  Surprise element has gone.

I am definitely giving it at least one complete cycle of APs, maybe two. 
I agree that the heroes are a big problem in terms of choice and that hurts any creativity, even with a small card pool.
On the card pool front I am also worried that 2 different cards per AP will not meet our thirst for new cardboard.

Personally I LOVE coop games.  BSG, Shadows over Camelot, Space Alert, Ghost Stories amonst others but LOTR LCG seems to be missing something intangible in our group

I do play a lot. Mainly because  I am trying to find out what I like to play. Unfortunately the games is dictating what I NEED to play at this point so I am getting frustrated.

That and I just had a sense of accomplishment, with creating the one deck, only to have it torn asunder.

Yep, that's the way to go, if you don't want to built scenario-specific decks.

Even without the extra-Gandalfs, the chances to win are _very_ good. In my playtest using all of the possible two-sphere combos, I won 12/12 games against the first scenario, 7/12 against the second, and 8/121 games against the third scenario.

I'm not worried about losing interest in the game too fast. I played over 100 games using the core set. And I haven't even tried the fan-made scenarios yet!

It seems like part of the issue with people losing interest is that they have to change up their decks. I haven't gotten that far yet as I'm taking my time, but I don't think that the having to change my deck for a different scenario would bother me at all. I guess part of that comes from me playing games like Heroscape and Summoner Wars where you either build your army (Heroscape) or deck (SW) either as a counter to your opponent's army/deck or in the case of Heroscape, the map helps determine what army to build. So for me, I guess I'm used to changing things up to meet a different circumstance in the game.

Yeah, I agree that playing constantly will probably wear your interest thin. Remember that this is not a regular card game, where you might see a great deal of variety in terms of the opposition. There is, for me, an unrelated question in terms of the kind of long term re-playability this game will have. I've just begun to play against the 3rd scenario after defeating the first and then the second several times over a period of a few weeks. I don't play everyday either, only when I can do it confortably and can give it my undivided attention. I also do vary my decks, I don't always play the same one, even if it is the best. All of this has helped keep my interest fresh.

And blarg??????  As in Blargers?

Since each scenario seems to require a different build to defeat it...





Once you have a reasonable deck, I don't feel you have to change each scenario.
I first played against scenario 2 with a starting threat of 30+, and then played a 2-player game with both players having 2 heroes each, where we struggled, however, those issues were fixed and we have found that regardless of scenario we are 50%+ success rate, with that 50%+ all coming in the more recent games.

There are so few cards in the game that customizing is not really that effective.

This game is fun as it is right now. But give it some time. In a few months, with the first cycle of chapter packs out and a batch of new hero's, it will hopefully even be that much better.

LCG's are in it for the long run, and can imho only really start to be evaluated after a year or so. Who knows what cool new mechanics the designers have up their sleeves for future sets?

Yeah I don't mind having a side board and needing to switch cards in and out per scenario. I am used to that. I just have not found a build that will allow me to implement said side board. If I could take my deck and beat scenario 1 with it, not all the time, then switch out cards to do #2 and further switch those out for #3 I would be happy because then I could keep the Core idea for my deck whether it be a sphere deck or theme deck.

Maybe that will develop as the game grows. Like I said though. I am losing Interest but not all is lost.

Last advice: take some time off.  It is fun to have a few games to rotate between so that you don't get bored.  My son and I have SEVERAL games we like to play.



 

YES!  I can't believe the rabid single-mindedness some people show in gaming.  Was I ever that young?  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]  I have a slew of gaming options.  Yes, LOTR is one of "the new games" and probably is getting a little more loving right now, but I'm not playing it to the exclusion of everything else. 

 

 

@servant :  Some folks just don't like co-ops.  They want a single clear winner.  That's cool.  PLENTY of games out there for everyone.  Personally, I hope they never try to introduce a Sauron player to this game.  It didn't make their other LOTR game better and I don't think it'd be a good idea here.  Heck, here it might very well be impossible given the structure of the game.  There are co-ops with player opposition out there that work (Battlestar Galactica), but they were designed that way from the beginning.

I am not single minded about the game. I have other hobbies that are better IMO. I just set aside a time/day for each of my hobbies so that I can dedicate my attention to something I like rather than lose track have it all go to waste.

The more time I spend learning and investigating a game the better I can promote it.

The one and only reason i want this is because not even one of my friends or the guys at my fantasy shop wants to play this game cause its coop.All of my friends are fans of Tolkien but after their first game they went back to the other Lotr card game from desipher.Desipher's game is dead but my friends still play this game after 10 years cause it is competitive and they enjoy it a lot.They prefer to play a dead and old competitive game than a new coop game.

So now i am stuck with solo play and i can't find anyone to play with.The worst thing is that they all tell me that if FFG introduce a shadow player in this game they will play it without second thought but as long as this game remains only coop they will never play it.

Anyway even if i don't continue play, this game  already has a place in my Middle-Earth corner.

 I was so lucky... I got the game like... 2 weeks ago :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] and played some solo games... well, ok I admit... A LOT of solo games... then, played it with a friend... which was much more easier... and today I invited some friends over and introduced the game to them... and we played some good 4-player matches... all three scenarios... and we beat them all!!!!!!!!!!! it was really fun... sometimes dangerous, but we managed well...

 

so that kind of resparked my interest for the game... very cool, especially, when the APs will be coming out... can't wait to hunt the little stinker...

 

but yeah, I still play decipher, it's awesome... but not as awesome as meccg, which I still play, too :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] it's just so cool having 3 lotr "ccgs"...

First, I want to say that I like the concept of this game and the mechanics that are used. Of course also theme and flavour are fantastic.

For me the co-op thing is not a big problem, my friends actually felt it a welcome change. But that's it. They will always prefer any other game over this one.

For me the reason is another one: There is not enough variety to keep me interested in the game. I think to make up for the lack of the co-op element, there has to be some other element to make up for it. One such thing would be variety (different modes, deck-building and such).

Well, lotr offers deckbuilding...theoretically. But the problem is with four players, e.g. there is no deckbuilding possible. We could build 4 dual-sphere decks, but a lot of the good cards we want to play, can only come into play once at a time. And even if not, the restricted number of heroes and allies basically makes it very un-interesting / near-to-impossible to build four dual-sphere decks using two core sets.

With two players there are two decks we can build that differ from each other. This will provide a very balanced and interesting game-play.

Alone no matter what deck I build, the help of the other two spheres that I don't have in my deck is needed very strongly.

So in my eyes, this game is only rellay enjoyable as a two-player game. When played with four or three players, there is but the option to use one-sphere decks and these decks are - at the current stage - not that fun and consist of only 30 cards. Which makes a nightmare modus kind of boring (as we ended up playing without player-decks for almost half of the game). For two players there is the option of a dual-sphere deck, but even there deck building is extremely limited. It basically ends up as being a simple: Do I use 1,2 or 3 copies of card X? But there are no alternatives for the good cards and there is almost no possibility to try different strategies for two decks. (This is possible for a single-player using the off-sphere ally deck).

Ok, it is possible that the above-discussed issue is actually not a problem of the game itself, but a general problem of lcgs. Since I don't own any other lcgs I cannot really say. But I think that the game wouldn't become boring so fast if it was a co-op game, as sad as that is. Of course it will be fun to see new quests and new stuff, but I think with only 9 new player cards the game will still fail to make up for the lack of competitive play for a while.

With just the core set, the motivation to go through the same quests again and again seems low. Especially with four players where losing is really difficult. And even if there is a new quest once Hunt for Gollum comes out, just nine new cards won't change the decks much and the one quest will be boring once played for 3-4 times.

I think it might be the curse of this game and the lcg game concept: If replayability is too high, players won't buy new packs. But if it is too important to always get new stuff, people might be drawn to more constant games. And I think playing against another player is more fun in terms of replayability than co-op play.

This is just my five cents, though. And the reason why I won't buy adventure packs. I decided to wait and lay low until the first deluxe expansion hits the shelf to have a look at the game again and see how it evolved. Very possible I might buy the packs together with the deluxe expansion then.

When you use "co-op" in your post, did you mean competitive?

Replayability is one of the major issues I see with this game. After you play and beat a scenario a few times, the interest in it is going to wane because it doesn't really offer anything new. I wonder if one new scenario a month is enough to keep people satisfied. I've already beat the first and second scenario several times (and nearly the third) in that time span. That's twice as many scenarios as the packs will have and I don't play nearly as much as others do. While I haven't lost interest, I can see how it could happen.

I don't think replayability is an issue. Lack of choices and customization to a gainful means is. I could replay all of the scenarios over and over as long as I could see more than 1 possibility to win. On top of that to win with a core theme.

Waiting so long for the Golum AP and others to follow is what is hurting.

Yes, I can see your point.

I just wonder if we will see some additional spheres...because with 4 players it is kind of pointless to try and play dual-sphere decks I think. At least with the current choice of cards. Having more spheres to choose from would be nice.

I can see the game get more interesting, once there are several different strategies for decks within one sphere and across spheres. Like thematic decks focused on theme rather than sphere. (E.g. a Gondor deck or a Rohan deck). But in my eyes this game has one serious issue: Although I will keep changing my deck, the quests will stay the same (with one quest per month (?) added to the mix). It probably would be more fun to play against another constructed deck and an enemy controlling it...maybe co-op just isn't my thing after all sad.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sad.gif]

I really have still hopes for this game though. The adventure packs add quests, but maybe the deluxe expansions will boost the card-pool a great deal and introduce some new elements. Let's wait, see and hope!

I think they may add more spheres in the future. All their other LCGs have at least 6 factions, so I could see 2 additional spheres. I also agree with your hope that they make cross-sphere themes that play nice together.

 This is a two-player game.  It's too easy at three and four.  It's too hard solo (at least with the current card set).  But if they released it as straight two-player only, there'd be no end to the whining.  And they are able to keep their options open.  Perhaps a future adventure will be suicidal with less than four players?  Solo is feasible with the lower difficulty adventures, but you just lose too much in the decision process for that to be as robust as two-player.

 

I can't see how this would ever have a Sauron player.  It'd be a completely different game.  In my case, it'd be one I didn't want to play.  And I don't think it'd add any interest.

 

The game's just going to need more cards.  More adventures to go on.  More heroic cards to inspire deck creation and, in turn, to inspire people to go back and replay all of their old adventures.  Knowing this, I'm glad this is in the LCG format.  I wouldn't touch it otherwise.  That steady drip of new cards might seem sluggish while we're starved for something new, but this time next year some of us might well wish the flow would slow down as we continue to work with the libraries of cards we already have.

When I'm playing solo with quests 2 and 3, I simply play a 4 for the price of 3 game on Heroes.

Basically, I choose 4 heroes but only start with the threat cost for the highest 3. All other rules I play as if I was a solo player.

I'm doing this at the moment because it allows me to practice and find some different synergies with dual sphere decks and as you say at the moment the card set is so small that unless you have leadership and/or spirit in your deck and use the sneak attack/Gandalf or Stand and fight/Gandalf combo's the 2nd and certainly 3rd scenarios are very very difficult to win and only then if you are exceedingly lucky in your card draw.

I'm not aware of anyone playing Solo that has beaten scenario 2 or 3 consistently with a tactics/lore deck - anyone?

With the above ruling it allows me to take a tactics/Lore deck into the 3rd scenario and at least allow me to get far enough to have a go at tweaking the deck, even if its still not good enuogh to beat it (yet).

It will be  more interesting if a real person can play as the shadow player.Imagine DND pnp without a DM.Just a group of guys trying to complete the same stories over and over again with different characters.You will enjoy your first games but after some games you know where you must travel what monsters you must kill and what you must do to complete the quest and the game becomes boring.

I don't say to change this game from a coop to a competitive one but they could give the option to play as a the shadow player.Those who like coop they can continue play like this and those who like pvp games they can enjoy this mode.More options more people more fun.

But i agree with you,it is very dificult for FFG  to do that .Denethor's abilitie will be useless if someone can control the encounter deck and they must make a tone of erratas to give us that option.

I built a solo Lore/Tactics deck that could beat scenario 2 at least half of the time. I used Glorfindel, Denethor, and Legolas. The strategy of the deck was to delay beating stage 1 until you have a large amount of cards in your hand. Then you use Protector of Lorien to complete stage 2 as quickly as possible. I can give you the deck list that I use if you want.

 

I just assume that scenario 3 is practically impossible solo so I don't have any suggestions on beating it solo.

I Love the Idea of having the game both co-op and competitive. I do agree more cards are needed. I don't agree with the Idea that we will be asking them to slow down production.

If they are adding new scenarios every month I am going to be a lot more interrested. I don't think they will though. I think they will be going the same rout a CoC with the expansions in lieu of an AP for that month.

And thanks guys simply talking about this has been helping me to relieve a lot of my stress over the game. I may just go ahead and buy that 3rd Core set now.

That is the optimal way to deal with the Troll. However in a 50 card deck you might not start with a Forest Snare. The other option is to put Protector of Lorien on Denethor and have him defend against the Troll, discard a card to raise his defense, and then use Daughter of the Nimrondel or Self Preservation to heal him. There are a couple of nasty shadow effects that you can hopefully avoid by using Dark Knowledge and Feint.

If you don't get Forest Snare, Protector of Lorien, or Gandalf  in the starting hand then taking a mulligan is your best bet. (Gandalf can reduce your threat and hopefully give you enough time draw a Forest Snare or Protector of Lorien.)

I don't think you're following me.  Look at how the game works now.  How does Threat work if you have a Sauron player?  How does Questing work?  These are just examples of intrinsic mechanisms in the game that you can't just alter to allow a person to choose what happens instead of having it automated.  What would make the game interesting to the Sauron player?

Check out my thread "an idea for pvp". I think the Sauron player having control of the Quest phase offers lots of choices. Do I give them Treachery to hurt them, but allow them progress on the quest or do I load them up with enemies/locations? Also, do I save some of the tasty Shadow effects for combat?

Threat and questing is not a promblem and it can continue  work as it is working now.What makes DND interesting for the DM?He makes the story and he choose what monsters the players are going to fight and he gives palces and location the players must choose to travel.Same can happen to this game.The shadow player can choose wich enemys and locations will go in the staging area and he chooses where he wants to deal each shadow card.

Again as i said before this is not possible now cause abilities like the one Denethor has will be useless and they must make new rules for the pvp mode but i don't think that they want to do somethink like this.

Is it  FFG's fault or poor game design if people play it 100+ times in like a month's time and get bored with it enough to start looking for alternative modifications? I know it's a fun game and can be addicting, but still. If people played Dominion or Thunderstone that many times in that time after release, those people might be losing interest too. I guess part of what allows for LOTR: TCG to be played so much is the solo play ability, but still, a lot of games are going to get old quick if they are over played. It's kind of like a video game, if you buy a video game and spend 30 hours over a weekend playing it through it's completion, you might feel cheated. But if you play it for 2 hours a week, you might get more satisfaction from it with 15 weeks of play as opposed to 2 days. happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]

I'm not sure it's too much of an issue..

I think custom scenarios can only be a good thing, for instance. I also think the delay in the first adventure pack wasn't something FFG intended, and once they get going once per month the lack of scenarios won't really be that much of an issue. With new cards in each pack, I'm sure players will also want to see how those work against the older scenarios. Besides, I have even played scenario 3 properly yet anyway!

New rules seem to fall into two main catergories. Firstly, making it competitive, which for some people seems to be key (in which case I wonder why they purchased a co-op game?) and the second is scaling for either solo or 3 to 4 players. I do find the pure solo game very difficult but that could be due to the small card set and we don't really know whether FFG designed these scenarios in this way to offer up a taster and to hopefully get the buy in to thr adventure packs, does a solo player simply need a bigger card pool to beat scenario 3 with using spririt? or whether it was an oversight on FFG's part and they need to consider scaling going forward with the adventures. Until we see the next adventure pack I guess we won't really know.

I'm happy with what they are doing so far, and it's only a core starter set.

I'd be interested to see what other people say about other LCGs and whether the went through similar growing pains?

IMO it's one of the best things to have when you have just launched a game and people are enthousiastic enough about it to play it that much that they bump against the limitations of the coreset. It's ever better if they stay enthausiastic enough about the game to invest more of their time and energy in it by making up new rules, scenario's heroes etc. It's similar to a srtoy in a narrative context. A story that's being told constantly changed and alters itself to the current storytellers and contexts. A story that has lost its juice/explanatory power/inspiratory power solidifies and dies. Meowmeowmeow.

I can speak only for my self.

I don't care so much if this game is coop or competitive or somethink else.I bought this game cause its Lotr.Why i want a pvp mode for this game?The answer is simple.No one of those i know and the guys in my fantasy shop have an interest for a coop game.They play card games which you can compite with a real person and not with the game.They think that if you want somethink like Lotr lcg is, you can buy a board game and just have fun with your friends your family your wife etc.They see card games as a hobby and a coop game like this  can't keep their interest for a long time so they don't want to give their money to somethink that can't give them pleasure for a long time.

Wen Desipher's Lotr was alive everyone in my fantasy shop had 3-4 decks and you could find more than 10 people to play with.All my friends had more than 5 decks and we did Lotr nights 3-4 times a week.Now i can only go to my fantasy shop and wach others play other card games cause no one wants to play a coop card game and  2 of my friends who bought the core set they gave them to me cause they find this game boring.

So as i said to an other thread i can only play solo and believe me playing solo all the time is not so funny.

 interesting thoughts, you guys... I am also inclined to think, that it is basically a good thing... I haven't lost interest at all, btw... it's just plain awesome...

just from a money perspective: I would really like this game to be around a couple of years, seeing as middle earth related ccgs seem to have a rather short lifespan... think about the possibilities, like quests in khand, mordor, nurn, you could even take alatar and pallando into consideration... who really knows, what happend in this timespan before frodo's adventure... :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] the problem is, if the "masses" jump off the ship, just because they get too bored too easily - then again, that's a general problem of our society :S

so guys, get your friends together, show them the game and force them to buy a copy :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] preferably at your local store, so you can get your local community going... the tournaments will follow then... and all will be good :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I just can't see how this is not make sense.Insteed of lucky draws from the top of the encounter deck a real person draws a number of cards and chooses what locations and monsters wants to add in the staging area and where he wants to deal each shadow effect.Nothing is change.Set up remains the same and you play all phases as you play them now.

Anyway as you said we 'll just have to go our separate ways on this one.

I think this example is not right.We must see card games like online mmorpgs where you can spend a lot of hours but you want to play more.Look at WOW.It is out there for 5-6 years and people still spends more than 4 hours every day and it has 11 milion subs?This is happening cause it has many options.You can do pvp,pve,level up, take new gear etc.

Now imagine a card game with coop,pvp and new adventure packs every month(like those we will have every month) and you have a sure succes and with so many option the game will never be boring.

Conversely, speaking for myself I purchased the game specifically because it was single player (in theory) and wasn't specifically a comp game.

One of the first articles on the game that FFG wrote was that it's whole premise was to try and thematically build up the idea of "the fellowship", and they did this by making it co-operative.

I understand your reasons for wanting it comp, but my slight worry is that if FFG did this, would it mean they had to detract from the idea that it was a co-op game. Would then then need to start balancing encounter cards that worked equally well in both co-op and comp modes? if they didn't one half of the community would start to complain that their "version" wasn't being properly supported.

I'd love for CoC LCG to become a co-operative and solo game because I love that genre, but i don't see it happening.

I think if people want a PvP mode, they should come up with their own home brew variant and let FFG stick to their original idea of building a highly thematic solo, co-op game.

I agree with you thats why i don't cry at forums why they didn't made this game both pvp and coop.As i said before i don't have a promblem with the coop mode.I bought this game cause it is Lotr and because i am a Bilbo playerlengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif].My only promblem is that no one wants to play a coop card game so i can only enjoy the solo mode in this game and i play card games cause you can have fun with real people and not behind a screen like you do with a video or an online game.

Okay, well perhaps my example was perhaps a slight exaggeration with the 15 weeks. But if you spend $50 on a video game and spend 50 hours to play through it completely twice in one week's time after you buy it, are you going to blame the game company because you are bored with it? All I'm saying is that if some people choose to play a game of any kind more obsessively than casually, then I don't feel it's the game designer's fault if those people get tired of it quicker than the people that choose to play the game more casually.

OK for me it boils down differently and also let me say that everything below is on the current state of the game.  I have high hopes for it and love co-op games in general, but LOTR being a constructive card game is a different beast.

I can play AGOT repeatedly, against the same player, with the same deck, 5 or 6 times in a night without a problem.  And then I can do that weekly and still be challenged.  This is largely because of the opponent.  The opponent starts waking up to my strategies, so I tweak my deck.  I burn him with a new strategy and he then evolves his deck too.  It's a process that I enjoy a lot.

In LOTR the opponent is static, so the wrestling of tactics, strategy and wills is missing from the gameplay.

 

And lets go back to the D&D element for a second but lets forget the DM entirely.  D&D is a coop game run in scenarios, much like LOTR LCG.  I dont know about others, but we dont play through the scenarios more than once.  It is relatively static regardless of the random aspect of the dice and people's decisions.

Sure LOTR can change slightly from scenario to scenario, but essentially the story is the same . . . through the woods, up the river, rescue a hero from the dungeon.  Same objectives, same bosses, etc.

 

For me this is where it falls down at the moment.  The game seems to be too static for my liking.  Once we have played through each of the scenarios once, that's it.  There is no real reason changing a deck, the opponent is static with a fixed card pool.
This may get better over time, it could also get worse as the player card pool gets bigger.

I am just concerned that the scenarios dont have the legs to carry the game enough on their own with the other dynamics of LCGs

## 67 [Hahma on May 25, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46977-beginning-to-lose-interrest-already/?do=findComment&comment=474756)

Yeah, it's certainly a different animal for sure. Like you said, with the opponent being static, it is a different kind of game than the others you mentioned and other non co-op games. This is my first solo/co-op game, and I see what people are concerned with. But truthfully, I think that's why I'm treating it differently than other games because of the static opponent. I know I can play a game like Heroscape or Summoner Wars many times a week and the games will be different as there are different maps/armies for Heroscape and different faction deck builds for Summoner Wars. Also, different opponents have different play styles whereas some are more aggressive, some more conservative, some are more strategic while some are more random. So there is a lot more potential variety in games like that.

 

When I saw that this core set came with 3 scenarios, I kind of figured right away that I wanted to take my time with the game and not beat it too soon because then I might feel like some other people here in that there's not much else to accomplish. With the Adventure Packs coming out later than expected, I really am going to try to make this experience last. I'm playing solo and had one co-op game when I really didn't have all the rules down. So I'm hoping to savor the experience by getting as much solo play as possible out of it, get a lot of two-player co-op play with my nephew and then to be able to teach my 8 year-old twin daughters the game and have fun with their experience. Then as the Adventure Packs churn out, I can do the same again with solo, co-op and with the kids. I've also been playing other games in-between sessions with this game, so that helps. Hopefully this plan will help me at least get the most out of the game. happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]

Well being that I'll be 44 next month, I'm probably not one of the ones playing an online video game for 4 hours a day. happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif] With work, family and a lot to do around the house, that kind of time is a luxury that I personally can't enjoy (but it would be cool!). I guess the video games I was more referring to were the ones that you don't play online.

But anyway, sure it would be great to have a card game the way you mentioned. I don't know if this game can get the pvp aspect into it, but perhaps they can work in more options for the spheres to allow more deck building variety and also more options in scenarios that continue to be creative and replayable. Are there other games that have the versatility of being capable of both co-op and pvp play? That would be interesting.

Actually, it's your example that doesn't work for an appropriate comparison.

The reason why (some) people cannot stop playing WoW is because the game is consciously designed to be addictive:

There are a variety of mechanisms in MMORPGs that may encourage obsessive usage. MMORPGs employ well-known behavioral conditioning principles from psychology that reinforce repetitive actions through an elaborate system of scheduled rewards. In effect, the game rewards players to perform increasingly tedious tasks and seduces the player to “play” industriously. These environments also encourage making friends or joining guilds that then become sources of social obligations. (quoted from www.nickyee.com/daedalus/gateway_addiction.html [http://www.nickyee.com/daedalus/gateway_addiction.html])

In other words, the reason why people keep playing MMORPGs is almost the opposite of what you claim. It's the constant encouragement to engage in repetitive actions by elaborate reward systems, reinforced by peer pressure.

Yea this is true but can you imagine a mmorpg without all those options?

Lets take pve for example.What makes pve players do the same dungeon over and over again?I think the answer is the reward.Now tell them that they must do the same dungeon over and over again just to complete it and you have a dead dungeon.

I think Lotr is like pve(maybe i am wrong).You must complete a scenario but in the end you don't get a reward.Wen you have completed it more than once you have no reason to do it again.

Many can say that you can create a new deck and try to win the same scenario with different sphere combo but can anyone here  tell me that this took you more than 2 weeks?I don't play more than 2-3 hours a day(and sometimes i play only 3-4 times a week) and i don't have any new combos to try after the first 15 days  with 3 quests.With only 1 new quest every month it will be worst and don't tell me that with the new cards the first scenario will be a challenge and i am almost sure that with the new cards not even second scenario will be a challenge.

The only thing that holds me in this game is that i am a huge fun of Tolkien and i make my own scenarios just to have fun.

Is this the type of game that is meant to be played as much as other games? Do people play co-op games like Pandemic or Castle Ravenloft   (which can be played solo) as much as other games?

Any game should be able to be played as often as people want and not as some have said in smaller doses than other games.

No. I think Lotr is for more casual players and not for hardcore players.This is not FFG's fault but my fault.I just wanted a Lotr game which i can play  it a lot and have it as a hobby.I think i must wait for the other 2 Lotr games (the video game war in the north and the rpg) for a full Tolkien experiencegui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif].

I will not quit this game but i will have it as more casual game experience.

Perhaps the smaller doses suggested is based on that a game like this is a little more limited than others because it's scenario and deck building driven and at the moment anyway, there is a limit to both the scenarios and deck building options. Games where you play against others can have many more options for variety as you can play against different people and they can have different enough play styles to make games different enough to play a lot and still feel fresh. Add to that, if those games are deck/army building, then that adds even more variety in play.

 

So while I agree that a game should be able to be played as often as people want to, it doesn't mean that every game is going to feel as fresh after X amount of game played. Perhaps in a year or so, there will be enough releases of Adventure Packs and whatnot to make this game to be played 50-100 times a month and feel fresh every time. At the moment however,  for a game system that relies on future releases to keep the game fresh, it's still in its infancy and somewhat limited.

 

I've played a ton of Heroscape over the past 5 1/2 years and when the first master set was released, there was a limited amount of figures you had available to build armies with. So if you played 50 times in a month, it wouldn't feel as fresh because you've used every option and army combination, as well as map build. As time went on and more expansions were released with both figures and terrain expansions, the game's variety and players options continued to grow and so did the fresh fun feeling.

 

I've also played Summoner Wars that was released a couple years ago. When it was released, there were two base sets and each had 2 factions each. So if you only bought 1 base set, you could only one faction against the other and that was kind of limiting. So even if you bought both base sets (around $25 each) you only had 4 factions to play against each other. Over time, there have been 4 more factions released and some reinforcements for the previously released factions were released. In July, there is a master set with 6 more factions being released. So here is an example of a game which had started out with limited variety, but has grown into having a great amount of variety. I felt that it was a great game from the beginning, but I also knew that I couldn't play it 50 times in a month with the base set without it feeling stale. So I'd play it and then put it down for awhile for other things and as the other factions were released I'd pick up Summoner Wars again and enjoy it again and continue to do so.

 

I don't know what is typical for a lot of other gamers so I can only speak for myself. I personally don't expect to be able to play any game 20 times a week or whatever without it getting stale. Some might work that way but to me, those would be the exception and not the rule. My own play habits are based on my time restraints due to work and family and I also like to play a variety of games and not just keep playing one game continuously. That said, other people certainly have different play habits and expectations and that's great too. happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]

 Well... I sure do understand your arguments.... but a "perfect" game should aim for casual and professional players alike... e.g. in the computer scene - Starcraft (the first more than the second) you could play the game casually... but you could try and be a gosu in Korea :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

same with Magic the Gathering: casual is great and interesting - professional is brutal :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] but you can enjoy the game at any level and always having the option of going "hardcore"

 

having said that: even MtG got a bit stale (ok, the last Mirrodin Block was a FULL SUCCESS AND SO FUN TO PLAY), you have about 11000 (!!!!!!!!!) different cards as a card pool - reprints not included - and tons of deck options and EVERY card is compatible (unlike decipher... after Hunters it just got tooo weird... and I'm still trying to lay my hands on some of the expensive cards :S) - the oldest and the newest one... but even the grand MtG can bore you to death if you play 100000 games, which I did in my time, though you never lose the interest totally because of so many different possibilites - in my opinion, they have the best CCG designers in the world and quite a good community link... needless to say, I quit the game because of money reasons...

LCGs are way better with their model, but of course the card pool is way below average and expands more slowly... I mean, MtG brings out like 3 sets and 1 core set each year... at least 500 different cards per year... DIFFERENT.... that oughta keep the game fresh and exciting... though... I'm beginning to wonder, when will their creativity come to an end...

 

anywho: people, we're at the start of something great, just wait and see for the 1st cycle... then we can talk about failures, prospects, etc.....

Below is a post from Board Games Geek by a guy from Fantasy Flight. A thread there was made to complain about the delay in The Hunt For Gollum Adventure Pack. He's basically pointing out why they chose to release the core set the way they did regarding the number of cards etc., and also commented on how wihle  this game is different than others, it will get a lot of support from FFG. Sounds like they have some good stuff on the horizon for the game, so we'll have to wait and see. happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]

In our opinion, the core set provides a *great* experience (YMMV) for under $39.95, allowing players like the one above to enjoy the experience without further cost, and allows dedicated players to expand should they choose to do so.

I realize there are some differing opinions on this. Know this: FFG had a choice of providing a more narrow replay experience (with fewer card types but more of each card) or a broader experience (with more card diversity and re-playability). For our LCG core sets, we choose the latter. There is no conspiracy, it is a choice between a retail price point, diversity, and card counts. Players who want to maximize every option can, at a very competitive cost, by getting additional core sets to increase the player count and number of cards. Casual players, or people who just want to sample the experience, can do so at a very reasonable cost. Since dedicated players are the ones likely to purchase expansions, we make 3 of every player card available in these monthly release.

With four different spheres, there are many different combinations and abilities to customize decks in the core set alone. Of course it won't yet compare to other LCG's which have years of support. Also, the LOTR LCG gameplay is a very different game style from anything on the market at this point. Yet, it will be supported vigorously and the diversity will quickly increase. We are working on great content for 2012 already, and I think you'll love what we are releasing in 4Q.

In terms of timing. The LOTR core set hit retail shops towards the end of April, and we expect to ship the first expansion within roughly 60-70 days of that date (barring unforeseen events) and monthly thereafter (with some small gaps between 6-pack cycles). While I understand, and appreciate there are many folks eager for this to happen sooner, I don't think this window is egregiously long or somehow indicative of FFG dropping the ball. In fact, we get severe complaints when we solicit these decks early (i.e. before the core set ships) which is necessary to do in order to properly inform the global wholesale marketplace of the upcoming product as soon as possible. Damned if we do...

The game is a huge success for FFG (and for our international partners, especially in Germany, Spain, and France) and we're having a ton of fun playing it in the office. We're flying a few hundred "Hunt for Gollum" decks into the country early for this event, so that players can see the new cards and quest even earlier than we had planned and meet other enthusiasts in a FLGS. Being angry at this event is quite silly, as it will be great fun, and has no bearing on the main delivery of the expansions.

Take this information as you will. They are the facts as I know them, and decisions made as we see best for everyone.

Thanks,

Christian

They sould know better than me that huge success is not if you sell all your copies to the retailers(especialy with a Lotr franchise) but if people will continue to buy the expantions or else this game will die fast.Same thing happend to Lotr online.Turbine sold 1,5 milion copies at the beginning and the game is f2p now.They have many subscribers again but this is happening just because the game is free.Can this happen to a card game?I think no,we cant have a free card game.

They must be very careful or else the only thing they will have to remember is that they had a big success with their core set and a big failure after that.

The Lord of the Rings Online never sold 1.5 million copies at retail. Where did you pull that number from? It was a profitable game up to and including the F2P release. Developers can never please the super hardcore users. It's like a race and the hardcore get to a fence and say "more content more content more content" and the developers have to balance their wants with what retailers and more casual users want.

We may want things about a game that benefit us (the individual), but he's got to think about trying to find a balance to please as many customers as possible that have various personal demands or concerns for a game.

 

 

This part of Christian's post (below) interested me as he says that while this is a different game system than anything on the market, it's going to get lot's of support from FFG. It sounds like they have products ready for the rest of the year and are working on next years additions to the game. Being that it's a very different type game than others on the market, it's hard to compare it to others.

I am aching for Gollum, but I havn't lost interest in the game. We have quite a few people around here into it. I've been playing with different deck designs to see what I can make work even if it doesn't seem optimal. I've tried out different ways of using the different colors. I keep a deck list with me so if someone wants to play the heroes I need for a deck, I just switch out the cards and use a different deck. I've been looking at different 2 and 3 color combinations. Sometimes even a good deck will have bad luck so they're not guarenteed to win. Different friends like to play differently. So to me its still fun.

Once several expansions are out, things will be much smoother :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] Its just how it is when you get in at the start of a card game.

Obviously they care a lot about the game and are thinking about it in terms of the long run.

Wow I did not think I would spark a firestormlengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif] I would like to thank the community for rallying behind me to keep my interest in the game. The fact that you guys showed up is far more important than anything you had to say. I am more excited than before about the game.

As for the things that were said there is a lot to digest and just stokes the fire in my belly.

One of the things I wanted to address was the comment about Fan made materials being a sign of the end of the game. I disagree. There has not been a game come out that hasn't had some sort of fan made supliment Dominion has one and it rocks! WH40k has a ton of it and it is incouraged. Fan made supliments are just a desire to see more from their game, and I do not want "more" to imply a weakness.

As for PvP I think it would be an exciting change. Does the game need it?... It would get more players to play so from a business standpoint I would say yes. From my own experiances with the Games I say, "No, it does not need it." Would I enjoy it? Hell yes. My group of friends and I LOVE Descent and it combines both ideas perfectly. A Co-Op with a Vs. mode reeks of win!!!

My other concern is the fact that this is LotR. How many games need to be made and fail for this universe? Is this one going to fail as well? It could happen but before I get all doom and gloom I think I will wait and see.

Thanks again! This community is the best I have ever come across. If anyone is in the northern Utah area hit me up and see if we can't get a game.

The Lord of the Rings is a very strong brand and with the Hobbit coming out next year that will help revive general consumer interest. FFG did a smart thing by going after the books, I think if Decipher would have done that the LOTR card game would still be around.

Hallo to everyone!!! I really like the game. But i already build up the deck which one is almost impossible to lose first and second quests. I mean for solo playing. Third quest is multy player so i think for solo is impossible. At least with core set cards. I cannot say i lose interesting but....... I hope exp pack quest will be more difficult and will be focused on the both side for multy player and for solo. I like third quest but there is no way to play solo. But why???? Someone want multy quests someone want solo. I hole there is more than 1 quest in exp pack other wise is boring. What you think fellows???

Well hopefully Christian is paying attention here and at Board Games Geek, as there is still a need for a quality FAQ. There are rules interpretation questions that don't have any official stance. If they are going to have this be a tourney game, then the event organizers would probably appreciate knowing the answers to questions players come up with.

A reply to the notion that the scenarios are 'static': that is not my experience at all.

Sure, the encounter cards and quest requirements are the same every time you play the same scenario, but since the encounters are randomized, you get a different experience every time, from extremely enemy-heavy to a big location roadblock and with everything inbetween. There are certain orders of encounter cards that may happen very rarely but that completely change the make-up of the game when they do.  The poster a few pages back stating that there is no need to play a scenario again after you've beaten it completely misses the point of this game, in my opinion. This is not Prince of Persia where the same critter is hiding behind the same wall every time.

I think what he ment by static is..There is a certain process to beating the scenarios and he is kinda correct however so are you. Basically after a few games you kinda get a wash rinse repeat cycle going and then our of the blue there is a hiccup you have to fix then it is back to wash rinse repeat. I know with my deck I was playing that I had certain things I needed to do in a certain order. I got to where I was getting a reasonable win streak going, about 60%. Was my method flawless? No .Not at all. After all I did lose a bit, but still the game started to feel like more of the same old thing.

Then again I do play A FRIGGEN LOT!!!! I do it because it is fun. I am not trying to find a break in the game. Just a more solid way to play. My goal is to have one deck that can play in all scenarios in both modes and that take a lot of play testing to figure out.

With 4 people you can probably just go mono-color and be fine. They wouldn't be exactly 50 cards but even with 3 sets you can't make mono-color 50 card decks. If you need to have them be 50 cards, just make 2/1 2/1 + 1/2 1/2 in color breakdown. So 2 Leadership/1 Lore,  2 Spirit/ 1 Tactics, and either the reverse (Lore/Leader, Tactics/Spirit) or the opposite (Lore/Spirit, Tactics/Leader) with the rest

I have updated the decks since then, but you could try the decks I posted here.  They are not ideal, but all of them are solid, and they can be made with dore core sets.

A dozen plays (two player) was all it took to drop interest. 

For me a lot of it is the how the mechanics of the game create a run-away train effect.  The first few turns are tough and interesting after that, except for an occasional bad combo, it's very static and dull.  It's pretty straight forward players are weakest turn 1 and the encounter is toughest turn 1.  Turn 1 you have 3 heroes and 3 resource points, nothing else.  As the rounds progress you get stronger, 3 heroes+attachments+allies+3 resource points.  Something hard to deal with turn 1 isn't even a threat later on.  At the same time the encounter challenges are toughest turn 1.  All quests start with cards in play+2 random flips.  If you survive the first few turns and get ahead of the encounter (clear everything out) your facing 2 random flips.  After the first few turns your facing a lesser threat from a position of greater power.  At this point the game feel monotonous.  It doesn't matter what encounters come up none of them are dangerous.  I feel like the stages are supposed to ramp up the danger but excepting one extreme location flood in anduain they don't seem to be enough.  Sure the nazgul is big and mean but we know he's coming and have no trouble dealing with him.

Options for dealing with the train

1) Advancing a quest stage brings the train back in line so to speak.  Reset things so the game is challenging again rather then monotonous.  Limit the number of allies, attachments, cards, resources you can bring from stage to stage. The reset can change from quest to quest and stage to stage but something needs to happen.  Once you've gotten ahead of a stage it will be dull finishing it but at least it won't be dull for the rest of the game.  Creates some interesting decisions on what to keep/toss as a side bonus.

2) Add a global effects to some cards.  Something like treachery cards that instead of leaving play sit in the staging area providing the encounter deck with bonuses for the rest of the game.  All orcs get +1 shield or undefended attacks do +1 damage.  Locations give +1 threat the turn they come into play etc.  Some way to make it so the encounter deck gets stronger as the players get stronger.

3) Increase the number of encounter cards staged as the quest advances.  In a two player game 2 at stage 1, 3 at stage 2, 4 at stage 3. 

I'm sure there are plenty of other ways to keep the game exciting throughout the match but something needs to be figured out to keep the interest up.

@Ratcur

I understand that frustration all too well. Part of what I have done is Lower the number of heroes. In a 1-2 player game use all 3. 3 Players use 2 Heroes. 4 players you each get one Hero. If you play mono colors you wind up with a 48 card deck, if you have 3 Core sets. Which is soon to be fixed with Gollum.  We have just started this format so there aren't many reliable play test results. Give it a try though.

My biggest problem with the game is the lack of cards in the core set. I agree with those that think x3 of ever card should have been the decision. For that reason my interest has been seriously knocked.

On top of that, irrespective of easy or difficult, I just don't see the game evolving much. The adventure packs will not provide enough player material (if it's needed beyond certain spirit cards) to change the decks and will comprise mostly of new encounter factions and quests. Of course such things are important and my introduce new rules (though constantly introducing new rules would be a bad idea) to spice things up. But for me, while the game is produced beautifully and does play fine, I'm rather regretting buying it over Warhammer Invasion. Shame I can't get my money back really.

I disagree with the amount of cards you suggest. I think they should have done like C'thulhu had  **** LOAD of cards but only 1 copy of each.

As to your other issue, the evolution of the game, I hope you are wrong. While I can see where you are coming from, I have to hold out hope, Manly because I am wanting to buy a 3rd set and can't get my hands on one. I think they really have something here if they do i t right. the LotR franchise though has been a pain in the ass when it comes to card game, and most other games, With a lot of hype, little support and no follow through.

After reading the recent news interview with FFG I disagree that the game is a "HUGE" success just because they have sold a lot of Core Sets. A lot of people are in your shoes and not liking the game and wanting to bail or not invest any further. If the game lasts 3 years I will consider it a success. 5-10 a "HUGE"  one.

I will see what I can do about getting a WH:I core and maybe we could work out a trade later. Funds are tight right now but maybe I can call in a favor or 2.

That's very nice, but please do not buy a WHI set just to trade (after all you could buy a lotr set for the same price). You might not live anywhere near me which would make shipping impossible.
