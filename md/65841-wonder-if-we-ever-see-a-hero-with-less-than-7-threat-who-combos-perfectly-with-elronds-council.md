****………. 

I would have wanted a new Hero or at least Glorfindel being tactics. ( although that was unlikely as we already got two tactics heroes )

 

 Guess they want to push Secrecy.

Glaurung must feel dizzy when seeing  the Valinor card.

Awesome Artwork.

Well, this is the first time I am without hesitation calling this card over-powered but waiting for Glorfindel for so long I do like it. Him and Strider, what's there to lose?

The best thing to say is that FFG isn't afraid to surprise us…this is a complete game-changer.

I'm struggling to find a reason not to include Glorfindel / Light of Valinor / Asfaloth

How does anybody playing Spirit not use Glorfindel now? This is a ridiculous card, especially with Asfaloth attached. No need to quest because you can just blow through locations with the mount. Get a Blade of Gondolin on him and you are in good shape.

I for a second thought of Glorfindel with the Brothers as the Light fits them all perfectly but then it would lack a Lore hero and an easy access to Asfaloth (and the Light is unique anyways).

this is going in my flight to the ford deck - strider frodo and glorfindel

 I think he is going to be really fun to use! Definitely a surprise on FFG's part.

It will be fun to make some new strategies with him. I wish that Light of Valinor was not included though, at least not yet.

 I like it too, as I like Glorfindel.

BUT I would have hoped he will be tactics so they get at least one good quester. 

All non tactics spheres get some love in more than one aspect of the game.

I played solo sphere decks and had decent success with all of them except tactics. (and I am talking about playing solo)

 I like the concept but the hero is completely overpowered - to hit the threat this hero should start at you have to quest with him 7 times - most games don't take 7 turns and any turn you don't quest with him is a free turn on top of that.

For starting at 5 I would have expected it to be raise your threat any time you refresh Glorfindel - as it is you get an attacker with as good an attack as anyone in the game for 7 threat off.

I'd have thought that 9 ( = his threat without the willpower), would have been better if it was only raised from questing essentially meaning you get his great willpower for free but it comes with a price. (+ 9 willpower before breaking even).

Maybe 8 if you wanted to make it a bit sweeter -  then you can quest with him 3 times (for + 9 willpower total) and still not hit the 12 threat he's worth.

 Also - as pointed out on the board game geek forums;

With light of Valinor,  Glorfindel doesn't exhaust to commit to the quest and therefore doesn't gain the threat.

 

Is that really intended? It makes this guy even better.

 Having not kept up with the Dwarrowdelf cycle, I'm completely oblivious to most of the card combos that can be used with this Glorfindel, but even without combos, I was stunned to see a starting threat of 5. It definitely wasn't what I was expecting. I was hoping for something a little more combat-oriented. I wonder if we're gonna end up getting Aragorn and Glorfindel in all 4 spheres. Definitely not my first choice in hero slots, but I could see the game moving that way.

Still, as a Spirit fan, I just found a great new hero. I mean, Spirit already excels at threat reduction, so negating his threat increase from questing is trivial. I'm excited to include him in a deck when I buy the whole the cycle after Shadow and Flame is released.

HAHAHAHAHAHA
YOU MUST BE KIDDING ME! 

 

This can't be serious.
 Now you can have a 3-Hero Secrecy deck that uses Resourceful… and the most interesting part, is that he went from the most threatening hero (12) to the one with the lesser threatening (5).

 

He'll be an awesome hero, specially with the 'combo'*.

 

 

 

* I cannot accept to call that obvious interaction as 'combo', just like him with Elrond's Counsel.

That´s what I was thinking. Just imagine Spindel, Bifur and Theodred. Starting with 19 threat and access to all secrecy spheres. Now you just need a decent starting hand.

YES!

Ha, oddly enough, I was thinking of that exactly combination!

 

I already have a Bifur/Theodred deck that is working pretty well, he will be A GREAT addition, without a doubt!

And If you get GG or Elronds Council in turn1 or 2 you´ll be secret again.

I for one am disappointed. The new (dare I say, older) Glorfindel is pretty awesome with some really intricate and powerful combos available and the artwork is really good. However, I feel as if FFG is lacking in their creativity for new heroes. This is the second re-issue of "original" heroes. Aren't there more options available? I know that I will use Spindel, alot actually, because he has some heavy attack power for a Spirit hero and I like to use Spirit.

 Aragorn, Eowyn and Spindel could be great too. Get the Light of Valinor on Spindel and Arwen out and  you´ll get questing for 11 and a 3 defense Hero and a 3 attack hero all in one turn. Via Aragorn you have access to the dunedain cards to pump stats up. You got Celebrian Stone and his Blade. 

 

I had a deck made without allies once…..I´ll think I try that again with the exception of Arwen.

Lol this. Sounds like some sort of spider or something and I didn't even know what people were talking about at first.

Loragorn fits too perfectly that's why that nickname stuck. This one just sounds… forced.

Unless someone comes up with something equally as perfect that everyone clearly understands right off the bat, it'll probably just be Blue Glorf and Green Glorf for me.

Yeah, KISS principle. 
Glorfindel (S) or Glorfindel (L)?

I'm happy for everyone that wanted a new Glorf though. What's cool is he really doesn't obsolete Green Glorf either as Green Glorf was real good, his healing is nice, dipping into lore sphere can be good, and Asfaloth is his sphere. This Glorf is ridiculously good though, especially for secrecy things but even in normal decks he's going to be heavily used.

I'm not sure why FFG has given spirit like almost every good card but still. It was already clearly the best sphere and lately just keeps getting more and more crazy good cards. It's probably good that there is no tournament system currently because every serious deck that showed up would have at least some spirit in it.

Hey i will  say nothing ok? Cose you know fellows what i will say….. Anyway art is amazing!

I just hope we not come to the point when will win the game in the first 2 rounds…..

Hey someone lose The long dark? maybe sometimes……. Forget about losing, just add Glorifindel and you can go drink your tea game is done.

I like the new Glorfindel. He's giving another option next to the new Aragorn for building a secrecy deck. Again, FFG succeeded in re-doing an already released hero by creating a card pretty different from the original one. I feared that they have to re-use a lot of characters, but as long as they put enough creativity in it, that's totally ok for me.

But what I don't like is that the new Glorfindel+Asfaloth+Light of Valinor will also find a lot of use in regular decks. Those 3 cards are pretty powerfull. I wished FFG would have made Light from Valinor a 3-cost, secrecy-2 card, and/or equipped the new Glorfindel with the constant effect "If you started with more than 2 heroes, Glorfindel has a threat cost of 12 instead", since Spirit is already pretty good in threat management. Anyway, at least Light of Valinor is unique, in contrast to Unexpected Courage!

Me too. The concept of the card is great and it is not overpowered by itself. But with Valinor - which should cost at least 2 resources btw - he becomes extremely powerful. Still not overpowered (he is in no way better than the old Glorfindel, except his low threat), but extremely powerful. Perhaps they should have changed his forced reaction to increase his threat by 1 every time he participates at a successful quest?

 

Let's hope they'll design more cards like "Black Uruks" that force you to discard an attachment from a questing hero.

You know when they start create more powerful players cards in second cycle i tell my self: Hey Glaurung now we have more powerful player cards is mean the quest will be more hard. 

But with release RTR very easy one then WIW is also quite easy and TLD difficult 7 bit this quest maybe is more easy then previous ones i lose my hope. So FOS should be hard like hell to please Glorifindel power and TAF should be difficult 9. But im pretty sure we will get another 4 and 7 difficult quests, easy win them from the first attempt (even without new Glorifindel). Then we will get new Gandalf and some card who can remove threat to zero in 1 go like Bless of Valinor: remove your current threat to zero cost 0, secresy: each hero get 5 resources, some players will be happy and say : ok now game is relly cool.

Im sorry i really upset to see how game is  going to be more easy and easy.

That horse card should be a 6 cost with 4 secrecy card for the exact reason you said.. to FORCE it into secrecy decks. The fact that it a preferred target for Glorfindel is not a big enough restriction.

I think the new Hero is good. I like low threat decks and even b4 "secrecy" witch has still yet to be proven to be worth the effort imo, So he fits right into the way I may decks. Also he attacks for 3 as well.. so this +1 threat is nearly meaningless, as even with out the do not tap or untap effects, if you use him as a attacker.. there is no threat gain and at 5 threat you can take a few threat a turn.

You can see FFG is madly trying to counter the problems in this game, and I find that encouraging. I still tink it will be a godo cycle or more b4 they get it right.. but this hero is a step in the correct direction.

I do agree we need more heroes. But they are coming, five in Over Hill and Under Hill, which is quite a boost! And it is probably a lot harder to design a hero than other player cards (by the way, is a hero considered a player card too or just those in a player deck are player cards?), not least because of the lack of iconic characters in the story (in terms of the game I mean, the story has probably more iconic characters than any other).

Now, talking about iconic, Aragorn and Glorfindel are two of those, and I don't think we shall see a new version of a hero for a while, not counting Bilbo for the Hobbit saga. There are two doubles out of the twenty three heroes out, I feel if we get a double in every ten heroes it is alright and fresh enough.

I see where you're coming from, but the problem is that if you make the quests super difficult, it forces people to use these powerful combos and prevents exploration of other deck-builds or theme decks. That's my biggest beef with powerful cards. I don't want to feel forced to use certain tricks to beat the quests.

They 've got to be joking. Glorfindel by itself is a pretty good albeit unimaginative hero card. With the cards than complement him though, he 's sick. Valinor, the mount and…

the new Gandalf.

With Glorf's low starting threat, there's really no reason not to include the new Gandalf instead of the old one. The loss of the threat-reduction the old one provided is mitigated by Elrond's Counsel, the new Gandalf's drawback is mitigated by Glorf's low threat and now Spirit has permanent access to an Att 3 Hero and an Att 4 Ally, doubling not only as the best control and questing sphere out there (with those two potentially not exhausting to quest for 7), but to a juggernaut of destruction, as well!

I have no words.

Maybe it's time for FFG to start implementing a restricted list in the AGoT fashion. With the new Glorfindel and the new Gandalf in it.

So the new Glorfindel has 7 less threat than his lore alter ego and he cannot heal. He's more useful than the old one, but not that much. And spirit already has a strong fighting hero - Dwalin. Yes, he sometimes needs a Dúnedain Mark or two to shine, but his ability makes him a more useful hero threatwise than new Glorfindel will ever be. That's one reason why dwarf decks are so good.

I still don't understand why they explicitely stated that Glorfindel has to exhaust to raise his threat. Why not simply saying "when committing to a quest"?

because committing to a quest and exhausting are completely different game states and should be separated in teh card text so they can make cards to change that start or bypass it or w/e… this is how card games work. The more finate and strict teh rules are, the less general, the more card effects and create synergies and combos and unexpected pairings.

I feel like FFG missed an opportunity a bit here. I really like the idea of a hero who comes with a low threat cost, but a negative special rule, as you then have to think about the trade-off that the rule brings against the nice threat value. But to release, in the same pack, a card that allows the negation of the only negative about a hero (albeit a unique attachment to do so), just seems…I don't know…too easy. I liked thinking around the drawbacks of heroes, but they kinda took that away with this one. Not to say I won't try out a secrecy Glorfindel deck, but I'd hoped for something a bit more nuanced.

there are good questers anyway… and he attacks for 3.. there is no reason to even quest with him if you build your deck to that and then you do not even have top wait for the draw.

I am stunned to see a hero this powerful for a measly 5 threat. As a way of comparison, Boromir, who can add far more threat in one turn and has far less options to reduce it, comes in at more than twice Glorfindel's threat. At first glance, he seems tremendously overpowered and with Light of Valinor, just plain ridiculous. His effect wasn't much of a hindrance in that sphere and now it can be completely wiped away. 

Also like many others, my first thought was: wow, now you can make a 3 hero secrecy deck???????? I thought the biggest drawback of that strategy was having the shortcomings of playing oly two heroes. Wonder if this is the direction the designers now want to take with regards to it?

True. Previously, Unexpected Courage might have seemed a waste for Glorfindel but Light of Valinor is a perfect fit. It works all the better with this version.

I also agree with Boromir's comparison although he can still be jolly great and Gondor's synergies are all but coming pretty much.

Finally, I do not think they gave up on 2 hero secrecy decks. From my experience the biggest drawback was not the money but the lack of actions early. Glorfindel with Light of Valinor fits either approach (2 or 3 hero deck). But I have a hunch some huge secrecy cards are still coming, especially the allies, there's only one so far and he's quite unimpressive. I'm expecting some cost 3 secrecy 2 allies.

You know when they start create more powerful players cards in second cycle i tell my self: Hey Glaurung now we have more powerful player cards is mean the quest will be more hard. 

But with release RTR very easy one then WIW is also quite easy and TLD difficult 7 bit this quest maybe is more easy then previous ones i lose my hope. So FOS should be hard like hell to please Glorifindel power and TAF should be difficult 9.

 

 

I see where you're coming from, but the problem is that if you make the quests super difficult, it forces people to use these powerful combos and prevents exploration of other deck-builds or theme decks. That's my biggest beef with powerful cards. I don't want to feel forced to use certain tricks to beat the quests.



Yes you  right we dont need super difficult but before we can get SUPER difficult please give us at least difficult. Cose what we have now even without all those new powerful cards quite in solo and 2 player game.

already exists.. it is called "Life's a Stage" it is a ziggy deck using Dunhere. You use will of the west and tombs to cycle your deck and sift it though ziggys combo. It works very well in solo, i think it was designed for that. and co-op… worth trying out.

I was obsessed with trying to get this to work for some reason. But 1 hero decks just fall apart if you don't find your crucial cards off the draw, like Resourcefuls or Zigils.

I did finally log a win with a 1 hero deck (Loragorn), though it was a co-op game (and Passage Through Mirkwood) with my teammate basically carrying me the whole way. Even then the score was pretty awful.

But at least I can check that off my personal achievement list I guess, lol.

They found some pics from the new hobbit big box expansion on a french site. The new gandalf has the same stats, cost, and HP. But his special ability has changed so that now he leaves play at the end of the round unless you raise your threat by 2.

That threat will add up fast… thats a potential 4 threat a round based on these cards, without factoring in failed quests, treachury, etc.

The new Gandalf and new Glorfindel may not be the best fit together. Not only because of the multiple added threat, but because once he is outfitted with Light of Valinor, Glorfindel basically does the same thing(albeit with a slightly reduced level of effectiveness).

Now, talking about iconic, Aragorn and Glorfindel are two of those, and I don't think we shall see a new version of a hero for a while, not counting Bilbo for the Hobbit saga. There are two doubles out of the twenty three heroes out, I feel if we get a double in every ten heroes it is alright and fresh enough.



 

I have a hard time believing that we are already recycling heroes when we haven't even had 3 of the Fellowship (Sam, Merry, Pippin) put into play yet.  Pretty sad…  No love for the Hobbits.

Yeah, I agree with you benhanses. I am excited for the Hobbit Saga Expansion and the 5 new heroes. I'm really hoping for some more dwarf heroes and synergy cards and of course, hobbits…maybe Beorn (?). I really think the Glorfindel's new card is really awesome but yeah, I was really hoping for an all new hero. Oh well, FFG will still be getting my money because I love this game.

Spindel sounds as ugly as shooting your own father.

 

 

Lol this. Sounds like some sort of spider or something and I didn't even know what people were talking about at first.

Loragorn fits too perfectly that's why that nickname stuck. This one just sounds… forced.

Unless someone comes up with something equally as perfect that everyone clearly understands right off the bat, it'll probably just be Blue Glorf and Green Glorf for me.



 

This seems obvious to me.  The old green Glorfindel is Lorgindel (LORE-findel) while the new blue Glorfindel is Sporfindel (SPORE-findel)???

 

Alright SPOREfindel is pushing it but LOREfindel totally works.

I feel Beorn should be coming in the Hobbit. Well, it would be another duplicate but with the Hobbit it is kind of bound to have some. And Bilbo isn't really as he'd be only used for that expansion. If we're not going to get say Rohan or Gondor heroes for the Hobbit saga (which I doubt), there aren't that many to choose from the story. And Beorn could be a hero for a change. I am really excited to see 5 heroes in each (presumably) box.

The thread with the link can be found on bgg, little lower but only published last week, the title has to do with "New Hobbit Cards," I believe.

the card says:

Gandalf does not exhaust to commit to a quest.

Forced: At the end of the refresh phase, discard Gandalf.  You can add 2 to your threat to cancel this effect. (and keep Gandalf)

I 'm considering a Glorfindel / Loragorn deck with the former as quester / attacker and the latter as defender with Burning Brand and aided by Arwen. Glorfindel and Gandalf will quest and kill like there is no tomorrow and Aragorn will hold ground, plus will use his awesome ability when threat starts to raise at alarming levels. Will have to wait till I see it in action, but, on paper, looks invincible.

My concern is how I shall fit all the lovely cards into such a deck. Both new versions of Aragorn and Glorfindel tend to combo like crazy. But they really seem to fit well together - and with the new Gandalf too. Some say nay but I say aye.
