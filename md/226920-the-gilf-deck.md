It's a Galadriel-themed secrecy, Victory display deck.

 

Hope you guys like it!  

 

There's nothing more fun in this entire game than playing "The Door is Closed"

> What is gilf?

Classically, if such a term can be used here, it is like a milf but with grannies instead. I am guessing it means something else here unless it is a reference to her being the grand mother of Arwen, Elladan and Elrohir?

GILF = Girl I'd Like to Flirt.

After a lot of play testing I found the steward/good harvest cards unnecessary. I had too many resources all the time so I got rid of those 6 cards and added glorfindel ally, light of valinor, 3 northern trackers and a galadrim's greeting.
