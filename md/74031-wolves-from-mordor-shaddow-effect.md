Hello friends,

I have a question about the shadow effect on Wolves of Mordor from MAO. I am not sure if any other cards have a similar effect. If an ally with 1-2 hit points defends on an enemy, and the enemy's shadow card is Wolves on Mordor that forces me to deal 2 damage to the defending character, is the attack then to be considered undefended because of a defending character's sudden death or the defender dies anyway so let's forget it and move on?

To be honest the first seems more correct to me even if it is an extremely bad situation that can kill a hero immediatelly.

if a character is killed half way through defending the attack is considered undefendedâ€¦and yes- a very bad situation indeed!
