OK, here's one of those pointless but fun questions.  How do you hold the cards that are in your hand?  Organized?  Whatever order you drew them in?


I tend to group them by type, allies on the right, events in the middle, attachments on the left.  Group same copies of a card together, but I don't bother to sort them by sphere or cost or anything else.

I come from a competitive gaming background, so I have a long habit of having them in a random order. I shuffle them around a bit while thinking about potential plays. If you play something at a competitive level, you watch what type of card your opponent plays and where in her or his hand it was. With many players, I can tell what sorts of cards they have after a short time based on the locations of their plays and where their eyes move when they're thinking and looking at their hand.

I sort them by sphere (neutral to the left, then sorted by the position of my heroes), then by ally/attachment/event, then by cost.

I have them sorted by sphere, dominant sphere first. And then by cost, the expensives at the end. But when i have a certain combo planned aheah, a have my cards in suspected playorder

I sort by sphere with positions matching the heroes position on the table. Then within each sphere its a little random, though usually in order of the cards I want to play out next or are emergency events. Kinda like a wishlist.

By sphere, then type. Beyond that whatever takes my fancy.

I don't hold the cards in my hand, I have them on the table in front the of me, with each group (e.g. Lore allies) stacked vertically so I can see the top of each card.

+1.  I do exactly this.

I mostly keep them in what order I drew them.  If I draw a "combo" (like Sneak Attack/Gandalf) I'll typically put the two cards together.

I store cards meticulously, but in-game there is little to no organisation. I can see why players from competitive card games would pick up the habit of noting this, though.

By sphere and copies of the same card are together, but that's about it.

I hold them in this order, from the left : allies, attachments and events, and by cost.

 

When I must do a random discard, I use a randomizing app on my iPod. (I know, I know...)

 

I recently organized my cards on my box mainly be effects (Ressources, questing + willpower, healing + conditions, attack + damage, etc). Everything, in each category, is classified by sphere, than by attachments ans events, and by cost. (I know, I know....)

Basically random. I'll re-order my cards up to the front that I intend use that round, but otherwise the order is dictated from drawing and my random re-ordering while I strategize...

I store them based on what I am more likely to play. So I have a couple allies followed by an attachment followed by some actions followed by an expensive ally.

BTW while this has no effect on my games due to my solo play, I find your technique and reasoning interesting and impressive!! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Hmm, I've never actually thought about this.  I think I just keep them in roughly the order I drew them.  Which is weird, because I usually have a set pattern for ordering my heroes.

This comes up in professional bridge as well, where official rules actually call observing where a player plays his card from a "breach of propriety" (although, as you can imagine, this is rather difficult to enforce). Apparently most serious bridge players make it a point not to arrange their hand in quite the same way every time.

This is the reason why professional poker players lay their cards down in front of them and only bend the corners up slightly if they need a reminder of what they are holding. Another big thing is glasses. I have played in some MTG tournaments where I could see my opponent's entire hand reflected in his glasses. At big MTG events I lay my hand down on the table, and simply remember what I have.
