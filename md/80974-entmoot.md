I started up a new blog about the Lord of the Rings LCG. It is called Entmoot [http://townisinchaos.wordpress.com/]. Currently I have my latest article on a new Beorn deck. I have some links to previous articles I did on cardgamedb. I am up in the air as to exactly what direction I am going with the blog. If you have any ideas of what might be good articles to write about please let me know. Thanks for checking it out if you do.

Write an article on how you think the Ents should be represented in the game.

 

(Which is what I was expecting this to be about :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png])
