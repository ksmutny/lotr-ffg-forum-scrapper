Interestingly, only 1 hero in this pack (not counting Frodo).

Yea I thought the low hero count was odd too. I love the allies spoiled on the About page. Elrond is another Condition attachment remover! He's like Gandalf for Lore because he has great stats, leaves after one round, and gives you three great options for what he can do. Other than each player drawing 1 card, though, his options are a bit more conditional, but they are still things that can be greatly appreciated. Healing 7 damage off of Beregond with Citadel Plate is always nice, though unlikely. Elrond is also nice, compared to Gandalf, because all of his options can potentially help teammates rather then just the player playing the card (Gandalf can deal 4 damage, which could help anyone too, but this is probably his least-used ability).

 

The Bilbo ally is also pretty nice because getting the Hobbit Pipes out before Smoke Rings can be a challenge.

Saga expansions have quests that meant to mimick the adventures in the book, whereas other quests are based on made-up stories intended to take place in a time between The Hobbit and the LotR trilogy. I also assume that you will not be able to use those spoiled attachments outside of the saga expansion's quests judging by how the other saga expansions worked.

## 7 [Glowwyrm on February 6, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/98610-the-road-darkens-saga-news/?do=findComment&comment=975948)

Lots of thoughts:

Doesn't seem like we're getting an objective-enemy Boromir and maybe not even an objective ally Gandalf.  From the burdens spoiled, it looks like anyone in the fellowship could be corrupted by the ring.  I like this because it allows us to write our own adventures in Middle Earth, though it could lead to some interesting situations, in which Gimli tries to take the ring while Boromir stays strong. 

At the end of the Fellowship breaking quest, I think we'll have to choose Frodo and a couple of other heroes (maybe one per player) to be removed from the player's decks.  They'll sit out the next saga expansion, while the rest of the heroes will follow Aragorn's path.  In the first Two Towers expansion, you'll be allowed to add new heroes to your decks without a penalty.  Then, in Frodo and Sam's saga expansion, you'll be allowed to add Smeagol and Gollum to your fellowship (three heroes plus Frodo) and then continue play from there ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

As many predicted, it seems like we're replaying Dwarrodwelf scenarios (Redhorn and Watcher in the first scenario and Long Dark and Shadow and Flame in the second).  I'm okay with this, and I trust that Caleb and Matt will have these scenarios feeling and playing differently. 

I also am okay with fewer heroes, as long as that means we get some fellowship members as allies.  Elrond and Bilbo are good, and if I had to guess, we'll get a Boromir ally since he's not in the core set and we don't need a third hero version of him.  I hope the other hero is Galadriel, who makes sense in this box and is long overdue in this game.

Q2 can't get here fast enough!

Holy Smokes!  These last few days have been awesome for the new articles being released.  This next Saga Expansion definitely looks great, but from the onset, I'm a bit bummed about a few things.  Obviously only getting one hero (aside from the Saga-specific Frodo) is a bit of a letdown.  Any thoughts on who it could be?

 

This is also a complete and total nitpick, but the artwork for this new Campaign Mode Glamdring is the exact same as the art on the Treasure Card version in the Over Hill & Under Hill expansion.  That's the first time I've seen a card's artwork duplicated and it's a pity they didn't update it.  On that note, the artwork for the Fellowship of the Ring [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/ffg_content/lotr-lcg/the-road-darkens/fellowship-of-the-ring.png] card comes directly from the game box of Lord of the Rings: The Confrontation.  Again, I would have liked to have seen brand new art.

 

But enough of my trivial complaints about artwork, I am totally hyped by these new articles.  I don't think for a second that any of the quests will feel like the ones we've already seen even though enemies like the Watcher in the Water and the Balrog are returning.  I am most interested in how they handle The Breaking of the Fellowship quest.  One idea that I have floating around my head is that they'll create a separate staging area for Frodo (on par with how Bilbo has a separate one for his Riddles in the Dark scene with Gollum) and then Frodo will be forced to deal with Boromir's attempt to seize the ring or perhaps some twilight world threats once he slips the ring on to escape.  Any thoughts on this?

 

Favorite spoiled card so far goes to the new ally version of Elrond [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/ffg_content/lotr-lcg/the-road-darkens/elrond.png].  Wow, I can't wait for this to release.

I knew I'd seen that art before!  Good eye.

 

We can finally stop putting that dwarf in all of our elf decks just for attachment removal.  The problem is my elf deck stars Elrond!

One other minor item. Elrond was not drawn by Magali, who has done all of that family's art so far. Furthermore, I know that she did a number of pieces for the recent MtG set. So now I'm wondering if she's still doing art for FFG and if not, could that be Arwen on The Three Trials.

Ughhh... I certainly hope that is not Arwen... as that would make for one ugly, non Elven looking Elf... I think that I would rename her Arwen's half Elf/Dunedin not spoken of ranger sister. 

 

The Elrond Ally card is not looking that wonderful either... I hope that the card looks better than the photograph.

I hope i am wrong on this, but I am starting to think the 2nd hero will be Boromir. He is the only one of the fellowship other than Gandalf who does not have a hero card represented in the core or BR, and i would be surprised if they made him an ally.

Might be a fitting hero for the Road Darkens, and if he is it will probably be the last version that we see of him, since he is dead after the fellowship breaks, but then we would have a new hero that would not fit thematically for the rest of the saga expansions, but that might not matter since players can do what ever they want in regards to hero selection.

Although, it might be Gandalf, but i think my first guess is more likely then the wizard.

I honestly don't really see Boromir fitting in the Lore or Spirit sphere and I doubt FFG would make the same hero twice in the same sphere.

I don't think Frodo counts as one of the heroes, meaning it should be a pair of heroes. Either Boromir and Aragorn or Gimli and Legolas. Not Elrond, obviously. My bet is on Gondor.

Well he will be in spirit after the 3rd scenario. Introducing the new low threat spirit Boromir, move aside Glorfindel!

But like i said I hope i am wrong.

The Saga heroes have always counted as 1 of the heroes when FFG lists the number of heroes - it is a hero card. There's only 1 other hero in this expansion. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Ok, after checking the Black Riders description it seems like we will indeed get only one hero instead of four and only 9 player cards instead of 11. That's disappointing!

Hard to know if it's disappointing or not, we've not seen all the cards! Maybe the remaining will knock our socks off and we won't even notice there are fewer!

 

Or, we get more fun encounter cards to interact with.

 

Really, the Sagas (to me) aren't really about the player cards - but the quests/encounter cards and getting to play the books. That's their purpose.

 

Either way, should be a great expansion!

I have to say I'm a bit disappointed by this news, and that rarely happens for me with this game.

I have no objection to duplicate heroes whatsoever. To me, they just increase your customisation options when you want to play as your favourite hero. At the moment the central heroes are so limited. Only one Legolas and Gimli since the game began. Ever since Lore Aragorn people have been objecting to duplicate heroes, and I feel the designers have neglected this to the detriment of the game. I want every corner of middle earth covered too, but I do not want to take Hirluin the Fair into Helm's deep. I think the game had focused too long on covering everything that the core feel of the books is now missing for me. I hoped this saga expansion would correct this and now I am truly disappointed.

I know we'll probably get every member of the fellowship as allies, and I like this idea, but I don't want them to sidestep the main heroes in the future. All I know is if I can't play a tri sphere three hunters deck by the next Saga box Ill be gutted.

Ps my vote goes to Gandalf as the Hero. Or at least I hope.

Yay!  Can't wait for this.  Hope there are some other fellowship allies, as others have said.  And it looks like our new Ring-bearer is still Frodo.  Maybe that is to be expected from here on out: endless versions of Frodo the Ring-bearer, with one version of Sam toward the end. Maybe no "alternate Middle-earth" in which Legolas was the Ring-bearer. Should make rich happy!

It would make sense... especially as they market the saga as only needing the Core set... however it would be really interesting to see how they would portray him as I think that the current T'Boromir abilities are already a great fit thematically... and you can't just replicate his abilities for the Saga. 

 

Sudden controversial thought... what if the alternative ring bearer is a new Boromir (like an alternative what if universe Boromir, where Frodo HAD given him the ring?) - though that would make for non new non saga heroes.

I agree with Dain.  I doubt we get a third version of Boromir (especially one that would likely be out of place in a Lore or Spirit sphere) when we only have one version of Legolas and Gimli - both of whom are Tactics.  If anything, my strongest guess goes to a Lore version of Legolas as the other hero card.  It is possible that Gandalf could be the other hero but also unlikely since, thematically, he will be defeated at the end of the second quest.  Alternatively, FFG could go all crazy on us and reveal a hero that none of us would ever expect (such as Grima in the Voice of Isengard.)

That Elrond is cool. Yet another nice target for Born Aloft. I don't think that Eagle-heavy builds are too popular anymore. But, if you were running 3x Elrond and 3x Gandalf (Core), it would be a nice synergy.

There's been a minor change to Glamdring's text:

 

Original Hobbit Saga: "Attach to a hero or Gandalf."

But then the kicker...

Thought I'd pop both cards up so everyone can compare them real quick.  I do like the new one quite a bit better.  It shows off more of Gandalf's epic hat and it's much brighter.  I'm still wondering why it didn't receive new artwork altogether though.

THIS is something I hope is just a mistake. I really don't want to see (never in my entire life!!) a Gandalf hero. Really, this wizard is a great guy and he's one of my favourite characters, but he's definetly not a hero.

Great another deluxe with hardly any player card spoilers. I like the 2 we have seen.. but I really want more player cards please!

 

> First of all, I don't see the point why there are so many people are disappointed bout the number of heroes. We already have nearly 50(!!). It's absolutly unnecessary to throw next bunch of 'em at us players.

 

Heroes are what make this game unique (besides the co-op thing) It is a major part of it and what drives most of the new deck ideas. This game has a criminally slow growth of player cards compared to the other LCGs. We get 9 cards about per pack, while other games get 20. In our deluxe expansions we get around 11-13+heroes.

 

Heroes are the MAIN driving force for varience in deck design... more of them are needed asap. Most LCGs get 20 cards a pack and 165 or so for deluxe expansions.

The Glamdring response still just references an attached character. I am betting the developers do not want Gandalf (OHaUH) at 6 attack if you are able to keep him in play for these scenarios, but I guess that did not bother them in Hobbit scenarios.

I'd be pretty shocked to see him as the hero, since playing multiplayer games it would pretty much make any the Gandalfs in other players decks useless, and if all you have is the core, BR, and this, Gandaf from core is going to be a big part of the other decks at the table.

Some things that make me lean slightly toward the possibility of him being a Hero would be that there is only one other hero in the saga which makes it seem like it should be an epic hero, and that it would be pretty cool to have him square off against the Balrog in the 2nd scenario. Glamdring seems to point in that direction too, but even with all this I think it unlikely.

Now Gandalf the White in the next saga as hero or ally is a real possbility.

Doesn't this confirm Gandalf as a hero? You obviously wouldn't attach Glamdring to a Gandalf Ally, and I would assume they would leave the language as character if there was no Gandalf hero.

> I agree with Dain.  I doubt we get a third version of Boromir (especially one that would likely be out of place in a Lore or Spirit sphere) when we only have one version of Legolas and Gimli - both of whom are Tactics.  If anything, my strongest guess goes to a Lore version of Legolas as the other hero card.  It is possible that Gandalf could be the other hero but also unlikely since, thematically, he will be defeated at the end of the second quest.  Alternatively, FFG could go all crazy on us and reveal a hero that none of us would ever expect (such as Grima in the Voice of Isengard.)  

Hey! I expected Grima! Even more, I PRAYED it would be Grima! 

 

Totally and utterly dissapointed by only 1 hero in the box. I can't find any excuse for this. Heroes are main engine of the game, and saga boxes were their main provider... and now... Well. My sincere hope is they didn't screwed up with this one hero left.

 

Also, extremely loved this Fallen into Evil trechery. Turning a hero into the enemy - super cool!

 

On a side note, ally Elrond and Grima would work extremely well together.

Really curious about that Glamdring wording now, although I feel as though as it could simply just be a typo with such matter of fact wording.

 

Also, 11 hours later, I'm still completely disappointed theres only going to be 1 hero.  I truly hope the saga expansions after this do not follow this same recipe.  Even from a marketing stand point its bizarre...the saga expansions are promoted for newer players or players that are not looking for the deep involvement of the the current deluxe and cycle releases whom may only have the core set.  Releasing a product that only gives 1 additional hero keeps their pool of choices incredibly shallow besides the fact that one can conjecture that its potentially even a rip off to provide 1/4 of the gameplay options a normal saga expansion provides.

 

It hasnt even been a full day yet and I'm already desperately hoping they'll release another piece of news that this was all a big mistake....  Next time someone interviews Caleb, I would love to hear the reason behind this decision...and then tear the logic to threads through the anonymity of a message board :/

 

Also, those wishing to see the fellowship members as the allies I think may be disappointed as well.  On the description page it states that there are 4 unique allies among the player cards.  With Elrond and Bilbo already spoiled that only leaves 2 ally spots and the hero spot to fill out the remaining 5 members of the fellowship (Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Boromir, Gandalf)  two of them are getting left out one way or another.

I´m excited about all the new artwork. Think it all looks great and who cares of a few have been reused?

 

Also if I had to choose between a lot of new heroes and a lot of new ally, attachment and event cards, my vote will go for the latter any day of the week. I feel I have plenty of heroes already and while new heroes are nice from time to time they just mean less opportunity to be used in decks since heroes are a much more limited type of card.

For the Hobbit yes i agree and i was pleased of how they made Gandalf.In the Hobbit he comes and goes and the story is based on the Dwarves.But in LOTR  Gandalf is not only a hero, he is THE hero.

 

He was the leader and the savior(Moria) of the company.He frees Theoden from Saruman's spells, saves the day at Helms Deep and the fall of Gondor was sure if he wasn't there.In a few words no Gandalf no hope for the free peoples.

 

That being said a Gandalf hero is a must for the Lotr saga.

Gandalf is the hero for sure. Think about it... this is the part of the series where Gandalf is the most critical: getting the fellowship through Moria and holding off the Balrog. There's nothing more heroic than that. I wouldn't be surprised if there's something built into the quest that allows you to discard Gandalf to defeat the Balrog, to add some thematic play value.

 

With regards to the allies, I think it'll be Gimli and Legolas. We'll get new hero versions of them in the next box when they head off to Rohan so now is the time to get them as allies.

 

The art on Elrond is horrible, he looks like he should be holding a guitar singing folk songs instead of being leader of the elves.

 

Bilbo is great flavor. He quests and fetches pipes, but if you plan to use him in a fight you're basically throwing him under the bus. I like that they didn't try to turn him into a combat powerhouse.

 

The thing I'm most interested in are the encounter cards. I'm really curious how they plan to do Moria (again) in one single scenario including the balrog fight. We had 3 deluxe set scenarios and 4 AP's dealing with Moria and now it'll be compressed into one scenario? I'm not sure how that's going to work, although I'm glad they didn't try to overdo it and recreate the entire Kazad-dum cycle.

## 65 [Tracker1 on February 7, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/98610-the-road-darkens-saga-news/?do=findComment&comment=977157)

Here is my latest thought on who the hero will be. If developers are going to create 2 deck lists using the core, BR, and TRD, while trying to recreate the fellowship, here are some possible combinations.

In the core you get Legolas, Aragorn, Gimli as heroes and Gandalf as ally

In Black Riders Merry, Pippin, and Sam

Frodo will be in TBR

Here is my wild speculation #1

Boromir will be an ally.

There you go all Fellowship members can be represented in 2 decks.

And we get a non fellowship surprise hero.

Of course the Spirit Sphere is not represented at all in the 2 decks so this might be unlikely.

Wild speculation # 2

Boromir as spirit hero, and Gimli or Legolas as an ally.

Wild speculation # 3

Gandalf a spirit hero and Boromir as ally, along with either Legolas or Gimli as the other ally.

Wild speculation #4

None of the above, and I am going to be completely surprised.

I think at some point we will see two decks with some combination of the cards I listed in my first 3 options, i suspect the developers intend to make it possible for players to have two decks that can get all fellowship members in play, I'd be pretty surprised if they didn't.

I think it will either be #2 or #3 and lean slightly toward #3

Is there a reason why everyone connects Boromir to spirit? Shouldn't he be lore, as he made his way rangeresque through the wilderness all the way to Reno Rivendell? Someone with a high WP who looses one WP everytime Frodo uses The Ring (or the Hobbits start singing)?

 

If Gandalf turns out to be a hero after all, will he stay neutral? And will his starting threat be 16?

I think Boromir will be a unique ally.  We really don't need another hero version of him, and there isn't a hero version of him that makes sense in Lore or Spirit. 

I think the other unique ally will be Galadriel. She needs to be in this expansion since she plays an important role in this part of the books, and if Elrond is best represented as an ally that does something powerful then leaves, it makes sense for Galadriel to have a similar function.

I would suggest a Galadriel hero (which would be awesome), but I think the heroes will center on the fellowship, and I'm starting to lean toward Gandalf.

Quote, I also agree that Boromir is a very poor fit for spirit.

 

I wouldnt be surprised that since its stated there are 4 unique allies, that each one will be a different sphere and we already have Elrond and Bilbo covering lore and spirit.  Boromir could be either tactics or leadership but not sure who the other would be...I also would want to see a Galadriel hero before we get her as an ally

My Guess:

The hero will be Gandalf, and his text will say:

During setup choose a sphere, Gandalf gains that printed resource icon for the rest of the game.

He would be a kind of neutral hero. That's the only explanation for only having one hero. Otherwise what's the reason? They thought we can't possibly put in any duplicate heroes so let's just put none at all?!

## 71 [Tracker1 on February 7, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/98610-the-road-darkens-saga-news/?do=findComment&comment=977430)

Concerning Elrond ally, probably not worth it at all, but you could attach Vilya to him. Other than gandalf and treasure cards I think this is the first example of an ally that can have a unique attachment.

It would cost 5 resources, but if you had Stargazer in play you could set up an expensive ally to bring into play, further more if you also have Spare hood and cloak you could ready Elrond, and use him during the round.

Thematically, an Anduril weapon attachment would require you to remove the Sword that was Broken attachment from the game since it is physically being reforged.  Or you could keep both and make Aragorn an absolute powerhouse decked out with all his goodies.

The only thing that kinds dissapoints me are the new Frodo hero (he is amazing but I was hoping for another character), and the new item boons. I would've liked to have Glamdring, Mithril shirt, etc as attachments, not boons so I can use them in regular expansions, but for campaign mode they're amazing. Really looking forward to this!

Gandalf is defiantly not ever going be be a hero. We may see him as a saga hero only playable in the Saga expansions but I highly doubt that as well. The card text doesn't specify that it has to be put on a hero.. only on Gandalf... we have seen character target attachments for a while, trait target attachment and ...  .. . wait for it, even a Name target attachment..

This BTW will be the crux of the next super deck. Unless they errata it.. No threat cost to get the Vilya combo? Whhhaaaaaat?.. not really.. the discard from play is a problem.. but the attachment CAN target him.

 

Anyway... this is the same as it will be for Gandalf.

All the "hero" conditional text means that you get a +atk bonus for placing it on a warrior.. warrior == attack bonus... makes sense right? The response will still count on a Gandalf ally.

> Gandalf is the hero for sure. Think about it... this is the part of the series where Gandalf is the most critical: getting the fellowship through Moria and holding off the Balrog. There's nothing more heroic than that. I wouldn't be surprised if there's something built into the quest that allows you to discard Gandalf to defeat the Balrog, to add some thematic play value.

I'm not sure that paying 5 resources to get one card for free looks gamebreaking. Even with Sneak Attack it costs you 3 resources.

yeah, well I did say "not really"... but the point is that there is already a attachment that can use a name as a target.
 

Still this is the kind of thing that can feed into a combo deck.. if the right card gets printed down the line.

There is the precedent (sp?) with spirit Glorfindel. And there are stats differences betwen ally and hero versions of the same characters as well (Glóin, Bombur, Bilbo Baggins, Dwalin, etc.), so it is not sure if he will have 4 in wp, attack, defense and hp as his ally versions do.

The combo is even better with Sneak Attack. It costs you three resources to get Elrond in play any way. So, 1 for sneak attack and 2 for Vilya is perfect. Plus you do not need to discard him. If you Drop Erebor Hammersmith and Good Meal in the deck you will be able to do it again next round if you have the resources or another sneak attack. As I said before having Stargazer to set up the top card, and Spare Hood and Cloak or Ever Vigilant to ready Elrond afterwards will make it even better.

This is definatly something I will try out, but unless I am running songs, it will take a Leadership, Spirit, Lore deck. Easy Sam, spirit Glorfindel, Pippin lore. Through in some Leaf Broochs and sneak attack will be free, so the whole combo could cost just 2 resources, for a real bargain price.

Im doubt about that combo value. ...but who knows..... sound a bit make a lot for 1 card. There is other more effective ways. Still is depend on the decj

yeah, like I was saying the combo is defiantly there.. the question is if there is any valid targets for such a heavy investment in your deck slots.

 

With a leadership hero if you have the "perfect" opening hand.. you can get a very strong start... but with a leadership hero.. why not run steward and then you can just pay for the most expensive cards raw, and you only need to draw 1 card.. instead of 3 (not including stargazer).

 

There is Born Aloft allowing you to save him from destruction (I think elves and eagles will be a thing).. but again.. what targets are you looking for... for vilya? Remember you are dropping 3 resources anyway... most cards are not much more expensive. The costs in this game are fairly uniform.

 

This game doesn't really have "bombs" like many other games. Beorn hitting for 8attack is probably the only one, and 4 cost trackers. There are no **** off awesome 10 cost cards or anything like that.

 

I dunno.. it is fun to play with but I can not see this being a thing at the moment.. BUT it is something to remember.. if the right card comes out... . . . well that is how combo decks are born.

I just put together a rough deck idea for this Elrond combo in the deck builder, and it takes a lot of card slots to pull of, not to mention how long it might take to get the cards in hand. For all the cards it takes to set up, it leaves less and less room for allies in the deck, especially allies that are worth the cost of the set up. Might as well just pay for them next round. although it can always be game changing to drop an ally into play, but if you can not ready Elrond you pretty much just wasted his stats to bring in an ally that probably has lesser stats then him.

Here would be a cool opening hand featuring this combo.

Elrond, Leaf Brooch, Sneak Attack, Spare hood and Cloak, Vilya.

Sam plays Leaf Brooch, and then sneak attack to play Elrond and draw a card, Glorfindel and Pippin play Vilya on Elrond and boom it's Gandlaf Draw 3 more cards, ready Elrond with cloak from Pippin, and then quest for 13 will power on opening round.

Ah, the stuff of dreams.

Its also possible there will be an ally version of Gandalf that says he can use hero attachments. I think its likely to be a misprint, though. I'd actually quite like a Gandalf hero, but it would be tricky to make without being overpowered, or too high a threat cost to be viable.

It says "attach to Warrior hero or Gandalf." We could still get a non-warrior Gandalf hero.

Well i was dumb enough to try it. I was able to pull off the combo a few times, but it was painfully slow, and when I did have it all lined up the top 5 cards that Stargazer arraged would often have nothing worth playing that could not be easily played next round, Occasionally I would get lucky and get something worthwhile, but for the most part this combo might be a dud. Although I am still intrigued by it, and will probably be dumb enough to try it again. Playing Vilya during refresh is a good point, I always forget about that window, so now you've added more fuel to my fire.

I respectfully disagree.  It seems that a lot of people have built up expectations of Gandalf's immense powers, but in reality (in the books) Gandalf did little beyond inspire, lead, and organize.  I don't mean to diminish him at all, but I can see him fitting nicely into a hero card in this game. 

 

He is Maia, of course, but clothed in mortal flesh that tires and hurts like anyone else.  He uses little of what we would call "magic" (in the books at least), but instead serves to guide, advise and inspire - and draw out the heroism in others.

 

Just as Bilbo Baggins defends better than Glorfindel (in the game), don't think purely of numbers.  Think of Gandalf as a role filled within the hero lineup and I think there are a number of good ways to represent him in a card form.

 

The reason his numbers are so high for his ally form is because of his mechanics and theme.  His ally form represents his ability to show up when needed most, help with whatever problem is at hand, then disappear at his own whim.  There is no necessity for a hero form to keep the same stats or the same sort of mechanics.

Gandalf would bring some baggage to be sure, but couldn't the same be said of Elrond? I like this explanation, that his ally is representative of his ability to show up when most needed. Gandalf would be a challenge, but I hope FFG doesn't back down from it, if not in this expansion then at some point.

I didn't think we would ever see a Gandalf hero, but based on the verbiage on Glamdring I now think we will. Secrecy had better get a big boost by then though because basically if you want to run Gandalf, that's about all you should get. Based on his ally stats alone he would come in at 17 and that doesn't count his ability. I'll be fine with that, but I really hope for ally versions of the rest of the fellowship.

I think the "pop in / pop out" Gandalf mechanic works best with his appearances in The Hobbit, but he could certainly take more of a traditional Hero or Ally form based more on his other appearances.  I second what you say about Elrond.  Many of the heroes bring some kind of baggage with them if you think of them only thematically.

 

My main point is that Gandalf is not some uber-God-like entity who can never be contained in a card.  He's a powerful character who could form the backbone of a group, but he's not unlike many other "anchor" heroes.  "Anchor" meaning the often multi-funtional, often high-defense hero that provides the muscle to allow the deck and other heroes to work, especially in the early game.  I'd classify Elrond, Dain, and Aragorn as other "anchor" heroes.  Gandalf could fit safely in their camp.

Just for fun, here are some non-uber Gandalf concepts:  

 

Gandalf (Spirit):  

 

Threat:  12

Will:  3

Attack:  2

Defense:  2

HP:  5

 

Response:  When you play an ally from your hand, if your threat is 20 or less, draw a card.  This ability may be triggered by any player once per round.

 

Gandalf (Lore):  

 

Threat:  11

Will:  2

Attack:  1

Defense:  3

HP:  5

 

Action:  Discard a card from your hand to add 1 resource to another hero's resource pool.  Limit once per round.

 

Gandalf (Tactics):  

 

Threat:  12

Will:  2

Attack:  2

Defense:  3

HP:  5

 

Sentinel

 

Gandalf may be declared as a defender with any other eligible defender against an enemy attack.

 

Gandalf (Leadership):  

 

Threat:  11

Will:  2

Attack:  2

Defense:  2

HP:  5

 

Action:  Exhaust Gandalf to choose and ready another character.

Your last sentence is key.  If Gandalf the Grey is going to be a hero in this game, this is the where it will happen.  After this Saga expansion, we're in the realm of Gandalf the White.

It's a bit strange, if we see a hero version of Gandalf the Grey, then will we see another when he becomes the White? 2 Gandalfs between 1 or 2 saga expansions?

 

I think he fits more the role of an Objective Ally (maybe a Boon?) that will be discarded by the end of the second scenario.

 

Although if he's going to be a hero, and the game "discards" him from a thematic perspective, we'll be forced to kill one hero from our pool, raise our threat by one for the next scenarios...but yeah, maybe  I'm over-thinking a bit, haha.

Anybody is possible, as long as it is a character in this part of the book.

This is a saga expansion, so it's taking place during the time frame of LotR.

In Warhammer: Invasion the Toughness X keyword makes the unit cancel X recieved damage regardless of its source.

 

In LotR it may work in a similar way - either a flat out damage reduction regardless of the source (so that you need 1 more combat damage than just enemy's defense + health to defeat it), or just a direct damage reduction (Gandalf's response doing X less damage and so on).

To all people talking about Frodo being ring-bearer again and also to those guys speculating about 2nd hero. Who said 2nd hero is not another ring-bearer? Just joking.

The quests look nicely, but I am disappointed with 2 things.

1st: This saga only has as many player cards as adventure pack.

2nd: The player cards art is getting worse. But on the other side, encounter cards art is getting so much better. They made a big decision that sagas will be mostly about quests. I hope they made good decision.

It was mentioned somewhere, maybe on COTR Facebook.  My guess is something like the Nazgul from Morgul Vale, where damage is reduced by 1, or maybe he lowers defender's defense?  Should be cool either way

I'm going to Atacama in February 13th actually, so I still can't answer that! I just came back from Colico lake though, which, for someone who doesn't travel all that much, is definately one of the most beautiful places I've been to.

That Balrog is awesome. I said that only player cards art is getting worse, at least it is worse in TTT(3 trials) and TRD. Elrond is just disgusting- the background is nice but king of elves himself looks badly. And then Bilbo. It is something new and original until you see his face in the window.

This Gizli, rem acu tetigisti! (for me you hit the nail on the head!) I think this art is GREAT! The one Frodo looks sickly but, hello, Morgul wound!

Since only APs and Deluxe expansions have "set" rules for the number of heroes to be included, one should try to not have expectations for the Saga boxes. Sure, the 3 so far have had 4 heroes - and I can see how that would set expectations - but I don't think FFG took the decision to only have 1 hero in this box lightly. In fact, I'm sure they anticipated this reaction. Therefore, I think we can expect something special.

 

Maybe I have my "formal logic hat" on in that past performance should never (logically) indicate present or future performance - so it's bad for all of us to assume FFG will always do things with this card game as they always have.

 

There are so many examples of people making assumptions (we'll never have a wizard hero, we'll never have a non-humanoid hero like gwaihir or an ent, we'll never have an ally not be the same sphere as the hero version, etc) and some of these have come not to hold, and who yet knows about the others?

 

who knows what the other sagas will do. whether they return to 4 heroes, or 3 or 2 or 1, or none!

 

from my perspective, there are tons of heroes already to make interesting decks, and only getting one hero isn't a let down. especially since i am assuming (and i shouldn't!) that FFG will surprise us with a great one - since it is only one!

True enough Dain, there are no set rules on this.

Just assumed it was 4 for the saga boxes like the 1 for APs & 2 for the deluxe ones.

Do hope your assumption is correct on it being a special hero though!

Gandalf would be a great bait!

 

We received the one-use ally version on the Core Set. We received the permanent ally version on The Hobbit saga. May it be time for the Hero version? The events of the second book are the only ones that Gandalf travels with the Fellowship up to the battle in the Black Gate. Most of time he is moving on his own, and when he joins other members of the Fellowship, he does it briefly, much like the Core Set version.

I reckon we're going to get a neutral gandalf hero,

He'd obviously have to do something pretty special, so how about if FFG introduced some magic? Maybe that will be the big reveal in this box. Because gandalf does use some magic in the book to dispatch the balrog, after all. So now would be the perfect time to introduce it.

Maybe they could do something like they did with the baggins and fellowship spheres, where you add a token onto them every round (a bit like resource tokens) and then you can spend them on their own special cards — magic spell cards

Maybe that is how we will dispatch the balrog. We'll need to play the gandalf hero and protect him until the balrog turns up, and save up all his tokens to play the spell card

I would quite like it if gandalf got his own sphere, just like the baggins and fellowhip spheres. They could add a saruman card into it as well, when the new cycle starts.

I wanted to represent his wisdom, and when something goes wrong, he can help in fight.

His ability also offers some special deckbuilding possibilities. He is spirit because it has threat reduction, needs attacker, Gandalf fits spirit for me and spirit is my favourite sphere :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

I know you guys want him to be spirit but I wanted to look at a Lore Version

 

-Gandalf-Front-Face-2.jpg [http://i46.photobucket.com/albums/f136/Sprengermon/-Gandalf-Front-Face-2.jpg] [http://s46.photobucket.com/user/Sprengermon/media/-Gandalf-Front-Face-2.jpg.html]

 

I think it is important for players to be able to use the neutral Gandalfs in there decks and a Hero version of him would really throw a wrench in that design. This version of Gandalf is based on the idea that he goes where he is needed and that he can really be utilized by any player at the table.

 

I don't see Gandalf as a constant man of action. There are times when he just wants to read books and experience the world instead of going on Perilous quests all the time. So while he is not off saving the world, he is in a more relaxed state thus he needs stats that reflect his outlook on life.   

 

In a solo game, you could use this ability at most 3 times without using any kind of Sneak Attack cards, however in a multiplayer this Gandalf will really shine because you could trigger his ability several times with multiple players playing his ally form.

 

As for the negatives, his ability is dependent on another Gandalf being put into play and the fact that he has a harder time saving resources because he is getting bounced in and out of play due to his ability. Resources are not saved like his attachments.   

 

The treachery reduction is to reflect that he has gone out to do something meaningful to aid the people of Middle Earth. Giving them a better chance of a safer adventure.

One question: if the Gandalf Hero is not in play, you can't trigger his hability to return him into play. Isn't?

That lore version Gandalf is pretty cool. I think the 2 threat reduction might be an issue with Sneak Attack that would be a total of 7 threat reduction for a cost of 1 which may get kind of broken.

Maybe when he returns after an ally version leaves play you draw a card, or search top 5 cards in your deck for an ally, or instead of an pick any type of card.. This would be fitting for lore, and it would represent his ability to help bring reinforcements.

Sure. Saga specific heroes that you can not use in normal games do not count. If one comes out in the saga or the delux or aps to the end of this year I'll buy you a FFG game of your choice and visa versa... deal?

Ok, so I don't know if anyone has considered this, (haven't read the topic complete), but the fellowship consists of 9 members: Aragorn, Frodo, Sam, Merry, Pippin, Boromir, Gandalf, Gimli, Legolas. In the core set we got aragorn, legolas and gimli as heroes, and we also got gandalf as an ally. In the Black riders we have Frodo, Sam Merry and Pippin as the heroes, so I suppose that FFG would like to complete the fellowship just by using the core set, the black riders and the road darkens. By using two decks (the three hunters and the hobbits) you get all the characters that do not die or dissapear in any part of the books to keep up with the lore. Using this I could deduce that Boromir is a ally coming.

Gandalf as a hero is a terrible idea.

 

I brought up Boromir myself a few pages back, but as the one hero. I guess an ally is more likely though. It's a bit too meta-game to build the saga box assuming the players have another Boromir hero, but the rest of us don't want a 3rd Boromir hero. Perhaps we are due for another alternate Pippin.

Bill the Pony cannot be replaced. He is lord of hobbit folk and calls no one master. He is almighty and all powerful. He is the beginning and the end of the black riders and the hosts of Sauron. No, Raven, there is no improving perfection. Bill the Pony  in hero form is as absurd of an idea as making a Faramir hero trying to follow Faramir the Ally's act.

What about a Galadriel hero?  She is sufficiently epic to be the only hero in the box, she'll come with a ring and a cool ability, and she makes sense with where the story is right now.  Given their focus on Silvan in the Ringmaker cycle (and her husbands appearance in the first AP pack), it would make sense to get a little Noldor love in this box.  And she's long overdue in this game.

This does sound quite plausible actually.

And I'd much rather have Galadriel as a hero too.

Hope it'll be her.

Galadriel would be so cool!! We have to eventually get her and she better not be disappointing!  And she should be Noldor but then her and her husband Celeborn won't work that great together is would seem...  I think it could be her but I think she may instead be in the Ringmaker cycle because Gandalf does seem more fitting for The Road Darkens and he has such an important role leading The Company he'll likely be the hero.

 

P.S. if they follow the release of Elladan and Elrohir back to back maybe Galadriel would be the Spirit hero in The Three Trials with an ability to help Noldor lower threat since the current Noldor heroes all have high threat...

The info on the Three Trials AP says, "A new scenario places immediate pressure upon Middle-earth's heroes and their efforts while players can summon reinforcements from the Adventure Pack's new Spirit hero and player cards."

 

Im really drawn in by this little teaser sentence. What do you guys think the mechanic could be that allows us to 'summon reinforcements'? Galadriel has her ring, but Im not sure exactly what it does. Im assuming it wouldnt be a spirit Vilya clone, but maybe something like it?

Yes. It seems strange to me to. It is interesting card making a hero an enemy, where willpower is its threat and threat cost is its engagement cost. 

But I have not missed that "Regiments of Crows" places 3 damage probably on active location or something!

And deep in the Internet i found this!

the abilities look believable. It is probably fake but, you never know. He says that his attack is 0 because he gets his ally value with Glamdring and Wizards Staff attached. He also says there are spells in TRD he can play. I want to believe it! Fellowship probably because he does not know the sphere.

Among other things, the set symbol is not the same as Frodo and the other spoiled cards (so this couldn't be for The Road Darkens). Then related to the font as Trololo says, the "G" in Gandalf should be larger than the other letters to be consistent with templating.

Yes, someone posted it a while back on the Tenth Nazgul's facebook page, claiming that somebody gave him the text spoilers and he made the mockup. Unsurprisingly, no one believed him. I also don't believe it, but as a card it is actually really "believable". The stats are balanced and the ability is pretty good. He also said that these new Fellowship heroes were going to be playable in normal scenarios, but are only able to play for neutral cards. He claimed that in the new saga expansion there are a number of neutral spell events that Gandalf can pay for. I know it's most probably fake, but the more I think about it, the more I like the idea. It would be awesome if it were true. Too bad the actual real cards tend to be a bit dissapointing compared to custom cards, except for the art of course.

Are you kidding? Reduce your threat by one means that the timed aspect of the game (raise threat by 1 every turn) is completely negated.

In a quest designed for it that could work but in any other situation this is incredibly strong.

I don't understand your reasoning. First - we have seen a spoiler of felowship sphere card from Road Darkens. Second - it would be pointless to create another saga sphere for each box. One saga-sphere per saga is enough.

You don't understand, rather than not understand my reasoning. At least it seems we are saying the same thing. I will be clear: The Road Darkens have Frodo as the Fellowship hero, so if Gandalf arrives in the box as well, he shall not be of the Fellowship sphere. I said nothing about another saga-sphere, I just said Gandalf will not be the Fellowship sphere.

Well, how do we know that 2nd hero is not fellowship? Was it written anywhere? I missed that.

If we will ever see alternative ring-bearers, there must be more Fship heroes in 1 box, because it is stand-alone product and Frodo and The One Ring must be in every box, although it is absolutely the same as The One Ring from TBR.

Sorry for my bad English, I hope you understand me.

While I agree with the One Ring, I don't think they should put Frodo in every box. If it was depending on my decision, I would only put fellowship Frodo into the Black Riders, and each next saga box would feature new Fellowship hero.

He probably will be - however it would be a lot better with 6 saga expansions for them to have promoted them as being sequential not stand alone (so that frodo was not needed in all 6).

I think that the Fellowship sphere will be present on every saga box.

 

So in the quests that follow Frodo's quest, he will be ring-bearer and be on this sphere, that is for sure...

 

And, as i thought, if there will be some saga boxes that don't follow Frodo, in those, it doesn't make sense that he will be included. In those, Aragorn is my candidate to be the Fellowship hero as he is the "main" character in that part of the books (hunt for orcs carrying Merry and Pippin, the Battle of Helm's Deep, the path after Stone of Erech into Pelargir, etc)
