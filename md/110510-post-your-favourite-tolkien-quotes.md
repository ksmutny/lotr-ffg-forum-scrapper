The wide world is all about you: you can fence yourselves in, but you cannot for ever fence it out. - Gildor

 

Not all those who wander are lost - Bilbo

This is when the Fellowship is in Moria and Pippin is on watch duty while they are sleeping (or trying to):

 

"Pippin sat miserably by the door in the pitch dark; but he kept on turning round, fearing that some unknown thing would crawl up out of the well.  He wished he could go cover the hole, if only with a blanket but he dared not move or go near it even though Gandalf seemed to be asleep."  

 

That would totally be me if I were in Moria.

"It is not our part to master all the tides of the world, but to do what is in us for the succour of those years wherein we are set, uprooting the evil in the fields that we know, so that those who live after may have clean earth to till. What weather they shall have is not ours to rule.”

You already posted part of this one, Rich, but it's always been one of my favorites.

 

Frodo: "I wish the Ring had never come to me. I wish none of this had happened."

Gandalf: "So do all who live to see such times, but that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us.”

Thanks! Yeah, I had kind of dropped off checking the forums much. Just was busy with other stuff and other games. But lately I had been really missing LotRLCG and now with new packs finally releasing I'm back full-bore!

 

Glad to see you are still posting awesome Tolkien discussions here, Rich!

 

Can't wait for more packs to release though. This first one already has some amazing stuff in it!

 

Here's another fun quote:

 

Bilbo: "I come from under the hill, and under the hills and over the hills my paths led. And through the air, I am he that walks unseen. I am the clue-finder, the web-cutter, the stinging fly. I was chosen for the lucky number. I am he that buries his friends alive and drowns them and draws them alive again from the water. I came from the end of a bag, but no bag went over me. I am the friend of bears and the guest of eagles. I am Ringwinner and Luckwearer; and I am Barrel-rider."

Can't believe I haven't seen this one:

 

''If more of us valued food and cheer and song above hoarded gold, it would be a merrier world."

 

It's a pretty good one.

"Even the smallest person can change the course of the future."

"All that is gold does not glitter. Not all those who wander are lost."

"It simply isn't an adventure worth telling if there aren't any dragons."

"Courage is found in unlikely places."

Gandalf makes a really cocky comment to one of the hobbits... i will have to search for this, as i doubt it will be on the internet, but i found it quite funny ....

one of my favourite film quotes, which is really part of a book quote only lifted from the fellowship ..

 

Pippin: I didn't think it would end this way.
Gandalf: End? No, the journey doesn't end here. Death is just another path... One that we all must take. The grey rain-curtain of this world rolls back, and all turns to silver glass... And then you see it.
Pippin: What? Gandalf?... See what?
Gandalf: White shores... and beyond, a far green country under a swift sunrise.
Pippin: Well, that isn't so bad.
Gandalf:  No... No it isn't.

I like how they incorporated that. In the book it's Frodo getting a glimpse of Valinor when dreaming in the house of Tom Bombadil, isn't it?

I like the following:

 

"If simple folk are free from care and fear, simple they will be, and we must be secret to keep them so.  That has been the task of my kindred, while the years have lengthened and the grass has grown."--Aragorn, Fellowship of the Ring.

 

"By our valour the wild folk of the East are still restrained, and the terror of Morgul kept at bay..."-Boromir, Fellowship of the Ring.

 

I also am fond of the Gildor quote about not being able to keep the world out.

Faramir: "Moonset over Gondor.  Fair Ithil, as he goes down from Middle-earth, glances upon the white locks of old Mindolluin.  It is worth a few shivers."

 

and.. "Maybe you discern from far away the air of Númenor."

 

from the Battle of the Pelennor Fields: "Still she did not blench: maiden of the Rohirrim, child of kings, slender but as a steel-blade, fair yet terrible.  A swift stroke she dealt, skilled and deadly.  The outstretched neck she clove asunder, and the hewn head fell like a stone.  Backward she sprang as the huge shape crashed to ruin, vast wings outspread, crumpled on the earth; and with its fall the shadow passed away.  A light fell about her, and her hair shone in the sunrise."

It may be the part of a friend to rebuke a friend's folly.


 


The wide world is all about you: you can fence yourselves in, but you cannot forever fence it out.


 


It is the first step that costs the effort.
