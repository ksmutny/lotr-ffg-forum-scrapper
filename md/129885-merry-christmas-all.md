Thank you!

The same to you!

All brothers and sisters of the community of our beloved LCG, have peace and joy during these days. I will not say do not weep, for not all tears are of evil! ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

Happy Holidays!

I wonder, what's in Sauron's cup of cheer?

Merry Christmas all!

I actually got Shadow and flame from my little bro.  I'm pretty excited.  Since I like dwarfs, I'm looking forward to fardy leadership and we are not idle!  Fighting the Balrog will also be a nice experience even though it doesn't make sense for Sauron to fight his own servant.

Merry Christmas All! =D

 

I got the 50th anniversary edition of Lord of the Rings and The Atlas of Middle Earth from my girlfriends parents as gifts!

So incredibly stoked and am going to re read LOTR and use the Atlas as a guide whilst doing so very soon.

Merry Yuletide & Happy Winter Solstice everyone! Or Merry Christmas! Or happy holidays! It doesn't matter what you celebrate, have joy and games and time to spend with your loved ones!

 

Tomorrow we'll play LotR non-stop, starting with quest 1. Let's see if we can play each of them at least one?

If you have not yet read it, I also recommend Children of Hurin. It is by far my favorite of Tolkien's writings.

## 16 [gandalfDK on December 27, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/129885-merry-christmas-all/?do=findComment&comment=1382675)

Yes, danpoage, that one I have read. It certainly is great! I am especially intrueged with those Dwarves, that are different from the sons of Durin.
