# [Question ... do resources define the character?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59838-question-do-resources-define-the-character/)

What defines a "[Lore] character"?

Song Of Wisdom says:  "Attach to a hero.  Attached hero gains a [Lore] resource icon".

A Burning Brand says:  "Attach to a [Lore] character ...".

So if I put Song Of Wisdom on Aragon, can I then put A Burning Brand on him?  Does giving Aragon the [Lore] resource icon (emphasis mine) count as actually making him a [Lore] character?

I had the same problem once and the answer was "yes, resource symbols define the sphere that a hero belongs to".
