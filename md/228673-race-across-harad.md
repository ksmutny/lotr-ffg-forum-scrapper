I love Thurindir! He's great since you can start with Gather Information to reliably pull any card you want from your deck if you absolutely need a combo piece. Also really happy they didn't make another 2/2/2/4 hero. 

## 3 [dr00 on August 26, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228673-race-across-harad/?do=findComment&comment=2386920)

side quest decks got a shot to the arm with that new hero

also of note, the River Tarnen separates South Gondor and Harad. i wonder if the heroes attempt to make it back to Gondor but have to turn back for some reason

also i love that the Tamed Mumakil remind me of the sailing objectives from The Grey Havens. everyone has their own Mumak to help them through the desert like everyone having their own ship.

also the quest setup makes me think we'll get a quest similar to Flight of the Stormcaller, except we'll probably be running away from the orcs instead of chasing them

Dunedain Pathfinder is amazing for location exploration decks, and Explore Secret Ways works really well with him too

and always happy to see more mount attachments

100% agree.

 

Gather Information into either Send for Aid or Scout Ahead, depending on what you want to do.  Love it.

I like Steed of the North a lot, even though it's restricted.  Readying when you need it most.

## 6 [Gizlivadi on August 26, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228673-race-across-harad/?do=findComment&comment=2386945)

Oh wow, these cards are amazing. Dúnedain decks just got a huge boost. Thurindir is also really cool, not only has he an amazing statline, just starting with a side quest in hand could be extremely powerful and open up a variety of decks (would looove to use him in a Dúnedain side quest deck if that is even viable). I love these cards.

most mount attachments are, which is silly because Beregond can't use his Gondorian Shield AND Spear of the Citadel while riding a Rohan Warhorse, but he can ride two Rohan Warhorses at the same time

I didn't see, but are Tamed Mumakil Mounts or just Objective Allies?

## 9 [Zalrus9 on August 27, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228673-race-across-harad/?do=findComment&comment=2386962)

Looking good! Looks like this will be similar to the first adventure pack from the grey heavens. Loving the heroes as well! 

 

Liking the objective allies, although it sucks that they are immune to player card effects... 

## 10 [Lecitadin on August 27, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228673-race-across-harad/?do=findComment&comment=2386966)

What's even more ridiculous is that he could even ride two Steeds of the North while riding a Tamed Mumak!

## 12 [donkler on August 27, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228673-race-across-harad/?do=findComment&comment=2386968)

Explore Secret Ways is good to see too. I appreciate that the designers are still thinking of clever ways to design around the location lock that occurs with a higher player count.

## 13 [Network57 on August 27, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228673-race-across-harad/?do=findComment&comment=2386978)

I never thought of multiple Mount attachments as riding two horses at once. It's probably more liked actual medieval custom of travelling with multiple horses so they can share the load, wear evenly, that type of thing.

## 14 [Calvadur on August 27, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228673-race-across-harad/?do=findComment&comment=2386987)

Isn't it somewhat funny how they say that "the storm comes" isn't that easy to set-up and then release a hero to grap the sidequest you want?

## 15 [dalestephenson on August 27, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228673-race-across-harad/?do=findComment&comment=2387001)

I just wish Snowmane wasn't restricted, so I could have Eowyn/Herugrim/Golden Shield.  I know Theoden can do that, but it's not the same.

 

There's actually a number of mounts that are not restricted:

Asfaloth

Arod

Shadowfax

Roheryn

Steed of the Mark

 

That's the same number as the restricted mounts in the current pool, though this new one is also restricted.  

## 16 [Supertoe on August 27, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228673-race-across-harad/?do=findComment&comment=2387020)

I really like the design spaces they are exploring here.

## 17 [Gizlivadi on August 27, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228673-race-across-harad/?do=findComment&comment=2387040)

Forgot to mention they said we would get Doomed support! I hope that thematically the card has to do with corruption or artifacts and not just some random explorer ally.

i feel like this makes it even more ridiculous that they're restricted though. they're helping to share the load, by i can't hold my Axe or wear my armour anymore?

i mean there's no way to resolve this thematically i feel (or rather, it's way too late to try to fix it now), i get the necessary mechanical restrictions, and i think that the crux of the problem lies in the restricted keyword, but i still find it silly nonetheless :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

The new hero is awesome! I have a question though: do you search for the extra side-quest after or before you draw your initial hand?

## 20 [Bullroarer Took on August 27, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228673-race-across-harad/?do=findComment&comment=2387288)

Pathfinder is broken.  SO glad that Spirit is finally getting some support.

 

On a more somber note, it's August.  We usually don't get AP2 until June.

## 21 [PsychoRocka on August 27, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228673-race-across-harad/?do=findComment&comment=2387333)

Dope new player cards! Love the hero such a great ability and at only 8 threat as well. He is killer in Lost Realm quests and the entire Angmar Awakened cycle. His text reads each side quest not each player side quest so his willpower could easily reach like 6+ in any quest that has several encounter side quests as he will benefit from these as well as your own.

Pretty cool that a great Dunedain hero has such an edge in a cycle and deluxe box that are dunedain themed and set in their area of middle earth!

 

The horse is great but man restricted slots are so **** precious.... as good as the horse is at 1 cost and non-unique whether you use this, UC, Wingfoot etc will depend on the decks other strengths and weaknesses. I play a fair few armour and weapon attachments so having Steed of the North take up one of those restricted slots is actually fairly detrimental. UC and LoV work better for me but this card will shine for other decks.

The side quest is fairly cool but definitely way better in 3-4 player than it is in 1-2 player. I am excited to see other side quests we get as the new tactics one is really cool.

Last year we didn't get the Gen Con box (Treason of Saruman I think) as a general release until November or December, but this year we had it at the same time as Gen Con.  Maybe cross your fingers for more of that?

## 23 [John Constantine on August 27, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228673-race-across-harad/?do=findComment&comment=2387348)

Another landmark is that we got a first hero with 0 attack or defense that can actually attack or defend.

Before, as setup comes first. When you draw you are actually already playing, I think.

This new hero is really strong, more so in multiplayer were everyone will benefit.

You can grab The Storm Comes and play any ally from any sphere early in the game.

You can grab gather information and everyone can dig up the card they need.

You get the idea.

And how about teaming him up with Galdor of the havens? Set up heaven!

The article claims that you search for the side quest after drawing your opening hand.

 

 

Not related, but I've just seen this full Nyashish artwork on FFG instagram:

Really? Ok.

Seems odd to me. Oh well.

Haven't read the article yet tho.

But that Nyashish art looks awesome!

Edit: read the article, and it actually makes his ability better imo.

If you draw 1 in your opening hand, you can pick a second.

Giving you options, and a bit of deck thining.

I really like our new Hero Thurindir and that sidequests can affect the game like this!

Not sure about that name though, a bit too similar to a certain Lord of the Eagles. But I bet it is on purpose and that's why you can see an eagle in the Hero picture! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Edit: Yes a restricted slot is precious so the steed is not something I would consider for every hero, but for the ones who enjoy running an ent deck with Leadership Faramir as one of the heroes you might consider attaching the steed to him and quest with him. Then when an enemy engage, you get to ready both Faramir and and the ent you just played.

At least being a Mount means it works well with Elfhelm

really curious to see Na'asiyah's ability and how it compares to her ally/enemy abilities.

 

 

also i very much prefer her hero art to the one for her obj-ally/enemy, so i'm glad we get this one.

 

and apparently she's Tactics according to the preview article, so i'm very much hyped for her.

Thurindir seems good, but is not dunedain for me. Dunedain defends and engages 10 enemies, he quests? Dunedain hero slots is also very rare. I play Amarthiul Aragorn (lore) Idraen or Amarthiul Aragorn (lore) Beregond (spirit). The setup keep watch is awesome, but Aragorns threat reduction and tStwB is better (i think).

It occurred to me that this spirit Dunedain hero almost certainly puts paid to my hopes for spirit Aragorn in this cycle.

Spirit Dunedain? Thurindir is Lore...or have I missed a reference to another hero?
