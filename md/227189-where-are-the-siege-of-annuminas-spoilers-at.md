I could be completely wrong but hasn't Gencon just passed? We already have the remaining cards in the Drowned Ruins spoiled (which was at Gencon) and the entirety of the spoilers for Flame of the West which seems to be out legitimately as well as at Gencon but we have nothing for Siege of Annuminas just yet.

Perhaps the event for Siege only took place today and I have no idea what I am talking about but I am just surprised we have spoilers for drowned ruins but not siege yet... 

Excited to see what that quest contains and if the Lieutenant is the Witch King himself or someone else!

Maybe we don't want to ruin it for people playing it for the first time at the Fellowship event. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

You know you can upload spoilers into an imgur album and just post the link here so anybody unwilling to see the spoilers won't see them unless they specificuly click the imgur link? ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

You know as well as I do that discussion will quickly spill over here.

If you create a thread with the name like "Siege of Annuminas SPOILERS", I don't imagine any person unwilling to see them will voluntarily click it.

I guess I fell into the trap of assuming that "someone else" was going to do it. I'll post them right away in a new thread.
