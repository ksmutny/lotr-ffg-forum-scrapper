Hey all,

The purpose of this topic is start a thread that we can share our interests in LoTR and potentially meet over an internet medium to play LoTR LCG and/or other games.  If something like this already exists, point me to it, because I am not aware of anything. Are there any current groups for this game?  There are a few outlets that I am aware that perhaps those interested could meet up to enjoy our similar interest.  For example, we could be meeting up on OCTGN to play with one another.  Skype and OCTGN make a great combination. Vassal could be used for the board games.  I play LoTR LCG a lot with my 13 y/o son, but I would like to play with some of you all as well.

Anyway, let me start by listing all my personal LoTR game interests.  Please PM to join up for any of these games in person or online.  I live in San Diego, but I am optimistic about allowing technology overcome distances. 

- The One Ring RPG: I just got into this and looking to play it via Skype, because it's definitely doable.  There are no miniatures required to move around, nor huge table full of mats or terrain required.  So far, I am really into reading the Adventurer's Guide and looking forward to GM'ing this one.  I think this one could be Skyped quite easily (with video).

- War of the Ring board game:  Awesome game. My favorite boardgame to date.

- Middle-earth: Quest board game:  I just ordered this. I haven't played it yet, but I did a heck of a lot of research on it. It looks to have tremendous upside and fills in the gap quite nicely between The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings.

- Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game (miniatures game, newly coined The Hobbit):  I am a decently skilled miniature painter and player, so this was a must have for me. 

- Lord of the Rings Online:  I am on the Gladden server.  If you have not played this yet, GET IT!  It is a F2P game!!  You will never find another game so visually immersed in Middle-earth.  I play some other video games set in Middle-earth too, but none come nearly as close to this one in its vastness, enriching quality. and replay value.

- Lord of the Rings LCG (obviously):  My first and favorite card game.  Actually, my favorite game to date. Period!

Regards,

Brian

LOTRO is fantastic!  Definitely the best bang for the buck.

For old school rogueish fun there's Angband, Moria, etc.

And don't forget the awesome mods: Third Age Total War and Last Days of the Third Age (for Mount and Blade).
