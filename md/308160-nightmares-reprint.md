Is there a slightest bit of possibility for the nightmare reprint or is FFG not printing the print on demand stuff anymore? I vaguely recall seeing some information that it is impossible but i'm interested inÂ how it really is.

I would be quite interested if they did

I see some are out of stock in the store, how odd, surely the whole concept of POD is that they print when you buy so shouldnt be out of stock. Very strange indeed
