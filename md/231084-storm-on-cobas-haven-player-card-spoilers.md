Na'asiyah's ability has no limit so with resource boosting it could be insane. She cannot pay for allies though. Interesting trade off.

Love Rune-Master! Going to be including more signals just so I can include this card to great effect.

So, she IS the objective made hero. Hmph. I gotta ponder on that one. Not being able to pay for allies is a hefty tradeoff for the luxury of 1 threat discount.

 

Rune Master: Might be awesum. Well, it makes those +1 atk/def signals worth. Shame it does nothing for event signals. 

 

Veteran Sword-elf is a weird one. You wanna one of those in your discard pile and two on the field for the most value... wait, 3 tactics cards in one pack?

 

Linhir Sea-captain is cool... prolly. Not sure, because I don't much remember housing much resources on a single spirit hero during my games. Well, if you mix in resource acceleration, then it's good 4 shur.

 

Windfola. Ah, I remember that name. Made a custom card of it very long time ago. The text is weird. I got dissed recently for restricted keywords on Steed of the Mark and that Noldor mount, yet here we have an official mount with 1 wp, restricted, and quest returning ability. I presume no more than 1 copy in a deck.

Also... The response refers to the attached entity as character first, and then as a hero. Gosh, who proofreads those?

 

The Houses of Healing - hello, Lore Fortune or Fate!

Not being able to pay for allies is a substantial restriction.  I think I'd like her better at 9 threat without that limitation.  The resource-for-buff is expensive since it applies to only a single attack, however, without any limitation on the number of times it has real boss-killing potential.  For defense it's good that there's an action window between shadow reveal and applying damage.

 

After all the criticism I made of a 1-cost Love of Tales, we have a 1-cost equivalent for [some] signals, though it's not "limit 1 per hero" and can also go on on non-leadership rangers.  Signals are more lkely to be played in bulk than songs, though, one of the current decks I'm playing has eight in it and its fetch ally.  The big advantage of this attachment is with signal portability, though.  Rune Master can make moving a Dunedain Remedy around essentially free!

 

Veteran Sword elf seems a fine addition to the Noldor stable.  Requires a discard engine to be worth playing.

 

Windfola is nice for a dedicated quester, especially if Elfhelm is around, though the ability is really niche.  But for any double duty heroes, the restricted cost hits hard.  I wouldn't want Windfola actually on Eowyn if I have tactics access, I'd rather have Snowmane and use the other restricted slot for Herugrim or Golden Shield.  OTOH, Theoden's loss of restricted on Snowmane makes a Windfola/Snowmane/<Herugrim or Golden Shield> especially attractive on him, especially TaTheoden.  (Maybe someday an ally Eowyn will be a good Windfola target).

 

Houses of Healing is a nice alternative to Fortune and Fate, potentially much cheaper.  Allows a heavy Lore deck to support Beorn or a separate Caldara deck.

 

I think the rest of the cards were spoiled already.

It's also unique, so only 1 copy on the table at all. It's a nice wee attachment, and I like the style of spreading out resources in a new way (ie giving resource production in a new way).

 

Ioreth and House of Healing stand out for me. The Na'asiyah is interesting. I quite like the tradeoff. It only prevents you playing allies, but it will push towards attachment and event builds when using her as a single tactics hero. Interesting.

What resource sphere do you have to pay in order to trigger the extra effect on Knife-work?  It looks like the space is just blank int he text box of the card.

 

Windfola is strangely worded, because as pointed out above it refers to being attached to a 'character' and to a 'hero' in separate lines.  The way it is worded, if we ever get an Eowyn ally you would be able to attach it to her, but she couldn't benefit from the Response text.

 

Houses of Healing: very very happy to see a new card to return a hero from discard.

It looks like Ioreth has the same issue. These don't look like photos or scans of real cards, so hopefully the final product looks normal.

This immediately bugged me as well. I guess you can attach it to an ally Eowyn - if we ever get one - but the response won't work on her because it references attached "hero".   1 cost for 1 WP isn't bad in itself.  It is a mount so can pair with Elfhelm buffs, but that response is extremely situational.    But I bet that means this encounter has some quest-character removal effects.

4 player game.  Every player includes a copy of Justice Shall Be Done.  Everyone also includes a copy a Gather Information to make sure everyone can get their copy of Justice.  The Lore player includes 3x of Mesage From Elrond.  For the last push, he lets each player give 1 player a total of 4 copies of Justice Shall Be Done.   Enjoy 12 cards and 36 resources.

I think Windfola is worded that way to include Tactics Eowyn as a viable target for the attachment.  It's a weird card,  1 WP for 1 resource isn't bad, it's a Mount, so that's good.  If you're not doing the Eowyn/Snowmane thing than Eowyn usually doesn't use her restricted slots, so that's ultimately fine.  

The response is just... not that great though.  I mean sure, it's fantastic when it comes up,  but it just doesnt seem like there is a lot of the time where it would.  Removing characters from the quest isn't that common.  If we later get a card that lets you remove characters from the quest for some substantial benefit (in spirit or tactics preferably)  than maybe.   Windfola doesn't seem to be that great if you compare it to the other 1 cost restricted spirit unique mount in the game, Snowmane, who is awesome.

yea, I don't think it's worth a restricted slot for certain. 

## 13 [dalestephenson on September 27, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/231084-storm-on-cobas-haven-player-card-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=2432976)

It does have snyergy with "Don't be Hasty", which for 0 cost can remove a character from the quest and ready it -- Windfola exhausts, re-quests the hero, and the hero is still ready.  But that's very, very niche, and if you have a hero you want to ready after they quest (for combat) you don't want to spend one of their restricted spots on Windfola.

 

You could also re-attach a hobbit to the quest after playing Elevenses, which is at least same sphere, though that only works to get one hobbit re-attached and is still very niche.

Na'asiyah is amazing. We are finally getting more quality low threat heroes. The restriction is minor because it is a deckbuilding restriction, so players will simply focus on attachments, etc. Notice her buffing ability does not have a cap. She's great against bosses or surprise early fatties.

Rune master is like Love of Tales for signals, except unique, except better because attaching is essentially free. It will immediately go in my dwarf greed deck because with Dunedain Remedy it basically gives unlimited free healing in purple.

I don't get the Sea Captain. Not exhuasting to quest is good, but as a repeated effect, not as a one time thing, and 3 resources in blue for a marginal effect seems super weak. I guess the 3 resources from one hero is a new Gondor theme, but on the red guy it was an effect that was game changing enough as a one time thing that it was worth it. The Sea Captain is meh, probably never see play.

> Rune master is like Love of Tales for signals, except unique, except better because attaching is essentially free. It will immediately go in my dwarf greed deck because with Dunedain Remedy it basically gives unlimited free healing in purple.

It's not really unlimited. It's still limited to once per turn until we get attachment readying effects.

I feel like Windfola is really just a 1 cost for 1 WP attachment, which is not terrible. Add Elfhelm hero and you've got yourself a very efficient willpower boost. I guess it's nice to be able to give meaningful mounts to both Theoden and Eowyn at the same time, even if Snowmane + Herugrim is generally the superior option for either one in the absence of the other.

> Rune master is like Love of Tales for signals, except unique, except better because attaching is essentially free.

 

I'm confused by this. Love of Tales is free and non-unique so from that stand point alone I wouldn't say RM is better.   

 

However, I'm still not a fan of the songs enough to bother.  Signals on the other hand are good cards and there are lots that see play.  This basically reduces the cost of the first one you play each turn by 1 (after the first one due to Rune-Master costing 1 in the first place).  Which is indeed great.

## 18 [Calvadur on September 27, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/231084-storm-on-cobas-haven-player-card-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=2433163)

Rune-Master is awesome. Signals are great cards on their own already and now you can play 1 fo free every round?

 

The great thing about Veteran Sword Elf is that you can choose if you prefer many characters or few stronger ones, even though most of the time you will need one in the discard pile to get compensation for the cost. You could even chump blcck with one and get the others pumped up. They have 3 hitpoints, too, what makes them great at soaking damage and defending.

 

Not sure on Linhir Sea-Captain. How many Spirit heroes are there that really Profit from not exhausting? How often do you want to wait for the effect and Count on it showing up? And what should linhir sea captain do with his Action as he is strait out bad at everything except questing? Low expectations for this one :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

 

Winfola surely isn't very useful in a great amount of decks, but we have quite a few Cards that work with removing characters from the quest and Winfola enables some wanky Combos :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] It's ok as a one of for questing only heroes and awesome if someone runs Elfhelm (2WP for 1 as an attachment is really good)

 

The Houses of Healing - Important Name, big effect. We recently got many healers and it should be easy to achieve a cost of 2 or 3 what is low for the effect as all alternatives cost 5. Most likely it will end as Sideboard Card if you expect someone to bring caldara (or Boromir :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png])

 

Na'asiyah. First of all I think she is super thematic. Having a corsair hero seems odd, but don't letting her pay for allies Shows that she doesn't really have Support from the free People and only helps us, because she got betrayed and we aren't the Monsters she was told we would be. Gameplay wise the Limitation doesn't seem that bad as you will often Play at least 1 attachment or Event per round where you could use her ressource. Getting 2 Points of stats for 1 ressource is a good deal and not having a Limit can really make her insane, without taking potential attachments into account. She is made for combat and combat only. I think the often laught at sword of numenor might be really good in the right quest on her. Stack two and with some readying effects she sweeps the board (merry with fast hitch could to the trick or example). Also jsut bringing her with ressource boosting (someone said rune master and dunedain mark?) to slaughter huge threats. I am excited to test how reliably you can boost her without Feeling to tunnel completly on her (easier in multiplayer for sure!).

Na'asiyah is going to be great. She is going to be an amazing defender since you get to choose how much you want to pay for her defense boost after the shadow card is already revealed. I think it would have been more thematic and interesting if the resources paid had to come from another hero, but alas.

Dunedain Hunter will be the best Friend of Nasiyah! And with the incorporation of the Side Quest The Storm Comes, you can still play Tactics Allies, but! with the resources of your others heroes. So there a couple of options for Her!

What I meant is that attaching the signal beyond just playing them (because they can move around) is essentially free once a round. With Love of Tales you get the windfall when played, but then nothing, so it might become a dead attachment. Rune Master will never be dead.

It would be neat to see something that gives you a bonus for each title a character has so you can load up Aragorn (Wingfoot, Runemaster, Nor am I a Stranger, Heir of Valandil) or even Denethor/Faramir/Boromir (Steward of Gondor, Captain of Gondor, Heir of Mardil, Lord of Morthond) and get something extra for the various titles they have.

I think we should see something like that. Maybe not for every title, but "if it has a title attached" kind of thing… I had thought of that before, and I hope to see it one day. It is always nice when things come together, and there are still so many traits with very little value...

Neutral Event

Cost: 1

Action: Search your deck and discard pile for a Title attachment with the printed cost 1 or less, and attach it to any eligible character without paying it's cost. Shuffle your deck.

Oh, I would like it, but I think it would be too strong. Maybe cost 2? Because at cost 1, you likely get it back to 0 immediately. Are all the title cards except the Steward cost 1 by the way? Stranger, Service, Friend, Master, Protector, Captain, Wing, Heir, Warden… I am surely forgetting some...

i think Ioreth is the only card i'd likely use a lot.

well, i'd probably use Windolfa a lot. i love Rohan. it's still a 1 for 1 extra questing power on a hero i'll likely always quest with, and the ability is a decent backup for quests that can remove questing characters

Houses of Healing looks amazing (but i'd likely use it as often as i use Fortune or Fate which is less often than i probably should, but more often than i sometimes need). that said, it probably helps Caldara decks a little bit if they can get a Lore resource icon. i also don't think i'd ever really use the exhaust to reduce the cost effect unless i didn't have the resources.

Rune-master also looks very amazing, especially with the recent Dunedain Remedy

and it was already spoiled, but Knife-work looks fun for a christmas deck or a tactics deck with an accompanying lore deck. i'm loving a lot of these cards that combine spheres, and this one is one of my favourites actually.

that said, and overall i think there's a lot of interesting stuff here, i think the overall power is pretty tame.

Na'asiyah has a pretty big restriction, a 1 reduction in threat for her stats, and at least a pretty baller ability to spend her resources on, but that restriction is kind of a lot. she's essentially just there for buffing herself.

Veteran Sword-Elf is in this weird realm of really interesting but likely really useless. additionally, with 0 or 1 in your discard, she's a bit expensive for her stats and for for 2, she's a bit undercosted but even then, it requires having drawn 3 of her, discarding 2, and only having one out for as long as you can, and even then, you just have the options of attack or defence. i think i'd much rather slot in dedicated defenders and attackers. i don't think i'd really play 2 of them with one in the discard when i could pay half the resources for a much better ally

yeah, she's in Noldor, the trait that discards a lot and can even draw a lot, especially with the likes of Erestor, but it's still kind of meh.

i was really hoping to like Linhir Sea-captain, but i just don't really. he's expensive for what he does, even with getting a free action out of your hero (cos he doesn't do much with his free action). he also doesn't really add any synergy with Gondor, which is what i was hoping for.

the main thing for me for this pack is the quest cos it's another sailing quest that has EVEN MORE SHIPS, which is just amazing, but i don't think the player cards will make a huge splash for me.

I'm kind of scratching my head on Linhir Sea-captain since his ability does not have any synergy with sailing tests.

Pardon my ignorance, but why not? If you have two characters that quest for free, that leaves them both ready to be committed to sailing quests, correct?

I haven't played then, so I'm not certain, but I believe the sailing tests happen before committing to the quest.

If they're exhausted from the Sailing test, then they can't quest because you can't commit exhausted characters to the quest even though they wouldn't exhaust to do it.

Right but if the sailing tests happen after committing, this would work. Maybe I don't understand the timing for this.

From the Grey Havens rulebook:

 

>

> At the beginning of each quest phase (before committing characters to the quest), if the main quest has the Sailing keyword, the first player must perform a Sailing test.

So then this new Sea Captain does anti-synergize with that. You get two free questers, but can't use them for Sailing tests.

As far as I know there are no cases where the sailing test will happen after you commit characters to the quest, per the rules the sailing test is always the first thing that happens in the quest phase.

 

 

Got me thinking about what I would change his ability to though to make him more sailing themed  ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] :

 

"Response: After you play Linhir Sea-captain from your hand, if you paid all of its resource cost from a single hero's resource pool, shuffle 1 of your set aside Swabby allies with the encounter keyword into the encounter deck."

Strange thematic choice of ability on their part indeed. And to think about it, this could be so easy to do:

"Response: Afeter you play Linhir Sea-captain from your hand, if you paid all of its resource cost from a single hero's pool, both that hero and Linhir Sea-captain do not exhaust to quest this round, and can commit to the quest while exhausted."

 

Just like the Lindon Navigator.

Yeah, the Captain seems not very impressive at first, but then 2 willpower for 3 cost and not unique, that is not a bad quester, 2 hit points is alright, too, and the Gondor trait obviously a strong point. I would think the ability serves as a bonus, though I cannot think of many Spirit hero candidates, except Glorfindel, of course, but he can have Light of Valinor already. Théoden, Idraen or Lanwyn might be good options with their multiple good stats but they all also have readying abilities (built-in or via their attachments).

2 willpower 2 health and non-uniqe at the cost of 3 becomes increasingly frequent occurrance, especially in Spirit, so it's not something that special.

## 46 [dalestephenson on September 29, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/231084-storm-on-cobas-haven-player-card-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=2435495)

There's a few quests where the ability would be useful for hide tests or escape tests, but for most quests it's an underwhelming effect.  Gondor decks aren't likely to include spirit, and even with a Gondor deck on the table this card isn't likely to be better than Pelargir Shipwright.  (However, with a Gondor deck in play, at least the Captain could contribute to combat.)

 

With that said, although readying cards and effects exist for the quest/fight spirit heroes, there's no guarantee that those will trigger or be in play on the turn you play the captain, and even for typecast Spirit heroes, all but Beregond have 1 wp and all but Galadriel have 1 attack.  So I do think it *will* give a slight quest or combat bonus when you invoke the ability, it just won't be very powerful.

No, not special, not bad though either. Gondor trait might help the prospect, but yeah, it is not a card I am desperately eager to fit in a deck.

I just picked up my pack and will be playing tonight.  I love the sailing quests and have less love for the undead quests so it's easy for me to move on from The Drowned Ruins.

 

The quest is DL7 and there is a one page back story on Na'asiyah. (Na-ah see-yah?  Devolves into nausea?)  I seem to remember that in the end story of Drowned Ruins one of the ships was stolen, but no mention is made in the Cobas Haven insert.  Maybe it's on the quest setup.

 

More to come.

A little less good; the bonus only applies to the current attack or defense.

This quest is hard. I don't know if it's Cairn Dum hard, but it's hard. Really bad things happen when you are off course and THEY ARE NO TILLER ICONS!! It's like impossible to pass the sailing test. And the treacheries! I'm not sure I could have drawn any better and I just got owned. I think this one might be easier with four players. (I played two handed.)

I've only played it twice -- 1-1 with a pretty powerful pair of decks -- but no way this is anything like Carn Dum hard. Even Raid on the Grey Havens is tougher.

Still, definitely the toughest quest of the Dreamchaser cycle proper (so far), though. I found the objective that directly helps with Sailing tests hugely helpful in both my runthroughs.

My main takeaway: there are a lot of friggin' ships! Kudos to the developers for making it really feel like a naval battle, as opposed to the pressured chase of Flight of the Stormcaller or the meandering journey of Voyage across Belagaer.

Have to disagree Sappidus. I think it's considerably harder than Grey Havens. I'm 1-1 as well, but I got so lucky at the end.

Depends on the decks I suppose.

Yeah, Raid... asksfor a all-round performing deck in pure solo.

I've played it with a Dunedain deck and killed the enemy during the irst turn, not questing and taking the threat hit.

Umm... correct me if I'm wrong, but can't you only use this ability once?

I thought that this was sort of like Steed of Imladris where is specifices that you discard "a" card to put 2 progress on the quest. I thought that there was a ruling that this meant that this particular steed was limited to "a" discard.

Wouldn't that be the exact same with Na'Asiyah?

That's still pretty boss to be able to buff +2 for any 1 attack or defense...especially in the action window after shadows.

Steed of Imladris is a response to the attached hero committing to the quest, which is why you can only trigger it once, because you only commit to the quest once (barring shenanigans). Na'asiyah's ability on the other hand is an action, so in the absence of a printed limit you can trigger it as many times as you have resources in any action window.

However, readying effects won't do you much good as those bonuses last for the duration of the particular attack they were activated within.

It's a great ability for single attacks and defenses, but too expensive to sweep the board with readying effects.

After my previous failures, I Changed my deck and used heroes Eowyn(T) Halbarad and Loragorn. Lots of cheap allies and attachments for Loragorn. Won on first attempt without much difficulty but i think i was a bit lucky with the encounter deck. Very challenging and demanding quest, needs lots of things to do
