If FFG keeps to the same numbering conventions: the two Tactics cards are 79 and 80, which would make the two Leadership cards 77 and 78…and card 76 was Wrapped! from the previous expansion. So no new Hero?

Not that FFG isn't capable of a gaff now and then. Which would annoy me more: no Hero or an incorrectly numbered one?

But aren't we due for a Spirit hero? Elladan just came out in the pack before last. And next week seems very early for a new pack. Well, FFG announcements have been known to make mistakes here and there……..

Yeah it is weird to get another Tactics hero but oh well!

I'm glad to see they're compressing the releases. It's not a mistake. I think this is another sign that we're going to see 4 packs in 3 months. I think Shadow and Flame will be out at the end of June.

It seems like they want to put two APs out back to back weeks at the end of one month and the beginning of another however then we have to wait for about two months for the next one.

As for the hero, I have been waiting for a new Spirit hero and this is pretty disappointing. As the Spirit player in the group I have been hurting for new heroes to use for sometime. I really want to get away using Ewoyn (Yeah I know she is amazing but I wish I could use somebody new). I recently started using Glorfindel instead of her, which has work out rather well.

As for the new Tactics hero I wouldn't be suprised to see a Hobbit character or another Dwarf.

merry  pippin -one of them could be tactic- both joined the military in RTK - but im thinking pippin of the tower guard will be tactics …..perhaps pip and merry will have a ellandan and elrohir thing going on?

 From what I hear on the forums, Spirit already gets a lot of love, and Tactics is often described as the ''meh'' sphere. Personally, I'm glad to see another Tactics Hero, because I love this sphere and think it deserves the attention.

## 8 [Sprenger on May 8, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/64190-no-hero-in-the-long-dark/?do=findComment&comment=627751)

It is hard to imagine a sphere with  Legolas, Boromir and  Gimli to be considered the meh sphere.

If any of the sphere should be consider "meh" it should be Lore. Beside the card draw Chick and Denethor, it doesn't have much going for it. All of other Lore heroes are extremely restricted. (Limit once per game, once per round,  and Bilbo's rotating card draw.)

I agree that Tactics was pretty boring to play when it first came out but now with all the Eagles, Elfs, and awesome attachments it has become one of the more enjoyable spheres to play. I mean who doesn't like killing stuff.

It just grinds my gears that I waited for a spirit hero to come out in the third or fourth AP based on how they have put heroes out so far just to see them get skipped. I will still get the pack because I enjoy the game and want to support the game. Just feel cheated thats all.

Aren't we supposed to have Gwaihir as a Tactics hero soon? I seem to remember the image was previewed on an Artist's blog or something.

I'll bet he's the next hero.

I remember back in the days of the Mirkwood cycle, they used to spoil some heroes well ahead of their release (Imrahil, Boromir). Wonder why the trend has ceased.

Tactics is weak in many/most areas (other than fighting). But it has plenty of good heroes - arguably the deepest line up in the game.  I tend to agree that Spirit has the greatest need of another hero, particularly one that quests at least 2! (oddly enough, Spirit has the fewest heroes that quest at 2 or more which is pretty crappy for the sphere I turn to partially for questing ability). Although, if the Tactics hero quests at 2 or more and has under 10 threat, then I'll be happy!

I think the new hero will be a dwarf. Right now the theme has been Khazad-Dum, exploring Moria, etc. It would seem that a new dwarf hero will offer more options to create a stronger dwarf deck. For those of you hoping to see a new spirit hero I wouldn't be too dismayed yet. There are still two APs coming out for the Dwarrodelf cycle and I have a feeling that 50% :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] of the next two will be a Spirit hero. Not to mention the up and coming Hobbit Saga expansion which has 5 new "famous" heroes.

So a nice guy from Germany put up spoilers on BGG for Long Dark player cards.

The new Tactics hero is Hama with 9 threat cost 1/3/1/4 stats and an ability that lets him draw a tactics event from the discard pile when he attacks, but then you have to discard a card.

Nope. Háma is the new hero (9 Threat, 1 WP, 3 Att, 1 Def, 4 HP), just spoilered on the BGG, as well as the other player cards:

 Tactics is fun, but it is weak because it's hard to accomplish anything OTHER than killing stuff. Although, I'm generally fine with that. Don't solo play with a mono sphere Tactics deck. Problem solved. (Although, Legolas, Radgast, and Eagles make a solo Tactics deck viable for some quests.)

I don't think Lore is weak at all. I find it to be by far the most versatile of the spheres. 

 

That Gwahir looks wicked! I hope we get him as a hero soon. I've actually been pulling to get Gwahir as a Leadership hero (or possibly even Spirit), but with the ability to spend his resources on Eagle cards.

Not to further lead this thread off topic, but I actually beat Watcher with an all tactics deck the other day. It worked really well. Thalin/Boromir/Legolas. Boromir actually ended up doing questing most of the time and Legolas had plenty of tentacles to kill. I just had to make sure to attack with another ally in case the tentacle backfired on me.

Sooner you start doing that the better.. she is a bad card for bad players. I think of her as training wheels for when people do not really know how to play very well. Her ability is trivial when you think of all the other quest fixers.. like say MapMaker / Protector… and her 4 will becomes trivial by early-mid game. Far better to choose a hero that has utility for the entire length of the game.

Sprenger said:

Boromir I am warming up to but I rarely play with him due to his really high threat cost.. though I have made a few decks now where he is key.. so yes.. he is good..

Gimi on the other hand is not so good. Much like Ewyon his abilities are simply not relevant for the majority of the game. While having a hero that can one shot most monsters is great.. you might have noticed that a fully powered up Gimli is way way way over powered. Many of his hits are not being used. If you are combining him with a range character form another team for example.. say Legoas he is hitting for 5 from turn 1.. 6 if you have Dain out. Add a simple blade or axe and we have him hitting say 8. This is of course with out even having a plate and a bunch of wounds.

My point is that you can run other heroes that have effects much more beneficial for longer right to the end game.. if you run Gimli a lot I am sure you have noticed that you end up with way way more attack power than is needed for most turns. This is a waste. So look to other heroes that have ubr game constant effects… Dwalin for example… he also hits for 6 on turn one with ranged support….

And finally Legoas …I'm not going to say that he is crap.. but Brand owns him in almost all ways. There are a few deck archetypes that require Lego.. and yes he is a good card… but Brand defends better, Brand quests better, and has a more relevant effect. He dose have more threat, but I feel that the ability of Lego really works against you if you are not drawing mobs. They are pretty close… but Brand defiantly nudges him out.. the combos that he can drive if why he owns lego… like the combo with beravor for example (the most powerful but only one of the many uptap combos he powers)

The point is that Tactics is still weak. If it was not for the eagles would it even see play?

Protector… of Edoras, you mean? With "utility for the entire length of the game?" I think not. It's out there 1-3 turns, depending on when you draw it and how many copies you get. Stand and Fight lets you up that count sometimes, but not every game. 

Mapmaker is resource-intensive. If you are paying the cost to up his willpower, that means you're not playing other lore cards with him. They're just dead cards in your hand, and sometimes you are going to want to have those on the table more than you are going to want to have a higher willpower from Mapmaker (even when you desperately need it).

In a multi-player game, I would agree that Eowyn is a "training wheels" card, but in solo play she is a requirement if you want to overcome the quest area. She minimizes the number of characters you need to send on the quest each round. Sometimes, it's nice to know I only have to send her so that I can engage and fight off more enemies with my other characters. I have tried running other spirit heroes in her place, and every time I have compared my results from round to round to what they would have been if she had been on the team instead. In every instance, without exception. I have wished I had run her instead. I had many rounds where my threat increased 2-4 points but wouldn't have had she been questing instead. A 4-5 willpower on a single character is nothing to scoff at.

I agree with most of what you said but I have to disagree when it comes to Questing. Sure Brand has a higher Will Power than Legolas but he is pretty useless if he does commit. A Legolas with Unexpected courage combo can single-handly complete a quest. In the games I have played where both Legolas and Brand were on the board, it seemed like Brand was always having to commit while Legolas was doing all the heavy lifting by placing 6+ progress tokens on the active location/quest card each round.

I like both heroes and when Tactics does not have to worry about commit they are scary good.

I suppose this goes without saying, but Brand is nothing in a solo game. His ability has NO USE while Legolas can add progress tokens and has a lower starting threat.

I, for one, hardly ever use eagles when I add Tactics to my decks. I usually stock up on attachments, events with a few non-eagle allies. Then whatever sphere I'm combining Tactics with will supply the majority of my allies.

Protector of Loroien

Boris_the_Dwarf said:

Defiantly, he needs to be combo'd with a resource engine… Steward is usually targeted at a Lore Icon of the deck running mapmaker. Steward is easy to splash in a lore deck though minstrel.

True.. Brand shouldn't be questing, and I did mention the "Quest by Death" deck archetype as being unique to Lego. BUT it only works if you are regularly drawing mobs. That deck can completely fail if you either draw nothing or if you draw stuff you can not deal with in a one-shot. While Brand augments other cards though untap. This can be an extra card draw, untap a ranged toon to assist in the next attack, untap a scry card (Den).. etc etc… has lots of utility. I agree it is ubr close on this call.. but I think brand nudges him out.

Budgernaut said:

Yeah, sorry I forget some people play solo. Yeah.. I am almost always speaking about normal games when I make posts unless I say so… should have been clearer on that. Yeah.. in a solo game it is Lego no competition.

Really?!! Man… give it a go.. Support of the Eagles is just insane.. Try a deck with that card and some eagles to power it… I doubt you will be disappointed. (not sure about solo, as there is little quest power.. maybe team it with spirit / rohan)

I really disagree here, and there are many threads on it. I think she in fact makes decks worse in solo as in solo the deck needs to be all about utility and maximising the use of a card for the entire game. I stand by what I said b4.. sure she DOSE do what you say.. but it is a crutch for building a "real" solo deck.. One that works better and imo is more fun as there is more interaction than just tapping a hero each turn like she is one of those bobbing water drinking toys.

The only "real" deck is Rabbit Run for solo Return to Mirkwood. This is still the most viable solo deck for that awful quest as far as I know.

Rabbit Run? Specifics?

I have plenty of fun with just tapping one hero, and I think winning more times than not provides plenty of interaction. I have swapped her for Frodo to allow my threat to start at 22, but when you go from holding the line at a minimum to constantly having to raise your threat 1-3 points each round, that's a problem.

I have played my deck (heroes are Bofur/Eowyn/Dunhere) against Return to Mirkwood several times and have fared just fine against it. Do I win every time? No, of course not - no deck wins every game. The encounter cards (regardless of the specific quest) are too random and unwieldy to guarantee a solid strategy will overcome 100% of the time,

Protector of Lorien is a fantastic staple, and I use 2 of them in the deck I play. I could add a third copy but I just can't squeeze it in.

Lastly, I would daresay that solo is the "normal" style of play for most people as opposed to 2+ player games. Unless you have a friend who is into the game as much as you are, it's so much more preferable to just throw down when there's some ample downtime in the privacy of your own home.

I really disagree here, and there are many threads on it.

I stand by what I said b4.. sure she DOSE do what you say.. but it is a crutch for building a "real" solo deck.. One that works better and imo is more fun as there is more interaction than just tapping a hero each turn like she is one of those bobbing water drinking toys.

The only "real" deck is Rabbit Run for solo Return to Mirkwood. This is still the most viable solo deck for that awful quest as far as I know.

 

 

Rabbit Run? Specifics?

 

 

basically the fastest deck you can build- i did this right after it came out…..used a pure rohan deck, and you hope to hell that you dont get any bad cards….terrible strategy but for solo its the only way to do it

The new Aragorn helps a lot against Return to Mirkwood as he can deal with one of the main difficulties (massive threat gain). Currently I am winning 1 in 3 with him, which isn't great but is much better than before. IMO you can still just get stuffed by the encounter deck without being able to do much about it.

no…..this implies the designers dont take into account any solo play….and as you are always quick to point out everytime i complain about these 'multiplayer only' cards…this game does indeed have solo orientated cards

if you have said this game sways more to two players id agree…otherwise no

i would say that the designers learnt their lesson from the poor scaling of return to mirkwood as there hasnt been anything near so bad since

I know you tried to be snarky and stuff, but to be honest, I didn't get it.
It says 1-2 (and I understand you know that).


He said the game is designed for two players. The second number there is '2', so the argument still stands.
There is so many cards and nuances of this game that holds the argument (Ranged and Sentinel being the most obvious) of this being mainly a multiplayer game, having the solo as an added feature.

I believe you have your reasons, but it's far better to explain them, than just hoping others to guess.

I can only advise you to do this. It is fun to play with Loragorn and the scenario can play out its full potential in solo mode. Now you can defeat multiple Attercop's on your way to the Elven king, and you still won't run out of threat.

even though ive argued this one to death (and i of course respect those opinions who argue otherwise) i still to this day strongly believe that solo play is more than just an added feature…..if i had to put a number on it i would say 60/40 multi/solo…and i have a few things to back this up

being here for over a year now i have seen many new comers and many rules queries etc. and a vast amount of them are in regards to solo…does this mean the game is designed for solo? well that previous sentence will not obviously suffice as evidence but it certainly helps

what also helps is the fact i wrote to FFG asking about their priorieties in solo cards and got a reply:

"Thank you for contacting us regarding Lord of the Rings Living Card Game. It is our desire to support all formats of play over the course of the product. Please be aware that might mean at some time(s) the spotlight will be more on one aspect or mechanic while other may seem like they're not getting any love, but don't worry. The ebb and flow of the game will move that spotlight always around."

that stated both would get equal love

all this strongly points towards a game that both has a strong solo player base, and has a deep solo design aspect, so i would hesitate to say that solo is a feature

i still think that the game sways more to mulitplayer….however i think this is a natural outcome, not a descicion made by the devs who say 'lets keep the solo to a minimum'

dude what are you smoking, you argue like 3 different and diametrically opposing points, though I guess I might just not understand what your saying… Lets try and consolidate…

Of course there is official support for single player. It says so right on the box. They design the game to be able to be played in all modes.. This isn't even something to discuss.. it is like making a massive post to explain to us that water is wet.

The question is …

Can the game design truly support solo, 2player, 3 player and 4player all at the same time.. and support all modes equally.? The answer is no.. no it can't.

Any board game player will be very aware of the problem called scaling. This means that the game goes out of balance the more or less players (in this case) you add or subtract. Scaling gets its naming from the idea of going out of balance and inherently implies that there IS a balance to go out of balance in the first place… An optimal setup for the game. In Arkham Horror you can play solo, this is a supported game mode.. there is even rule variants in the official rules to handle it.. BUT can anyone really sit here and say a single investigator is the optimal setup for Arkham Horror?… no.. absolutely not. …. in for this particular game, LoTRlcg , it is 2 players.

No one is saying solo is not fun, or there will nvr be a solo orientated quests or w/e…. … what I am saying, though, is that 2 player is the most balanced of all the modes, and this can not be some random accident… when they design cards they design for 2 player.. sure, they take into consideration solo and 3/4 player.. but it is for 2 player games that the cards get designed for at 1st consideration.

Supporting other format is not the same as designing for it. Regardless of the double talk sales speech that FFG sends out.

firstly im not smoking anything and i struggle to see how that was a relevant point to add to this discusion

i believe i am arguing two points and they are that the game is not just 'designed for two players end/' and that solo is more than a 'feature'

i am having a hard time figurin how i am making several opposing statements

however you are also contradicting yourself- you make such a linear statement as that above, and yet go on to make an actually well thought out description of scaling and design aspects, which most certainly isnt what is implied in the first case…..that statement implies that no thought is put into solo, which is wrong- obviously, as it wouldnt have had such great success with pure solo players such as myself- again most certainly not happy accident but design..again i point out that there are many cards- which you yourself have said- that favour solo players much more than any other

i am arguing that the game favours two player, but ffg take into account solo more than you give credit for…..yes there are bollocks up such as return to mirkwood, but has there been anything since? no….they obviously looked at player feedback, took the hint that it was terrible scaling and did what any decently function company would do and adjusted accordingly

so to sum up (incase there is some confusion here)

yes i agree that the game favours two player

yes it scales better two player

but this still doesnt mean that solo play is as invalid in design as you make out

how you be so dismissive of it without having a proof to support it apart from your own interpretation of the game….just look at the reply i got when i contacted them-

"Thank you for contacting us regarding Lord of the Rings Living Card Game. It is our desire to support all formats of play over the course of the product. Please be aware that might mean at some time(s) the spotlight will be more on one aspect or mechanic while other may seem like they're not getting any love, but don't worry.

fair enough call them liars and me naive if you like, but ill take it as confirmation of solos level of priority with the designers is higher than what you state

Hey Rich,

That is naturally the only answer you could have from FFG.
They would never say something to sway solo-players away; the game has the possibility to play solo, but you can see that even on that answer, they do not give you a hard evidence of solo play being a big part of the game, they say it's they 'desire', which means it's is not reality. See, you cannot desire what you already have, it makes no sense.

 

The game is designed for 2 players, that doesn't mean you cannot play solo or 3-4. I even believe it would be cool to have a solo-only quest, or something like that.
It's just the way it is.

## 51 [richsabre on May 24, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/64190-no-hero-in-the-long-dark/?do=findComment&comment=635472)

they are valid points cordeiroo and im going to stop arguing as i certainly dont want to end up falling out with you over something that hardly matters..

however id just like to end with a point that i forgot to mention previously-

as a pure solo player i have no experience of any other method of play…how does this relate to my argument? well i can say with absolute certainty that i have got a years worth of gaming (and collecting) fun out of it playing it this way- as much fun (or perhaps more) as any multiplayer would have

now while this doesnt affect the design of the game, what it does affect is the experience- from my perspective this game has a great solo aspect which makes it one of my favourite past times- now i highly doubt this would be the case if solo play in the game was just a happy accident- at best it would give a medicore amount of fun (the other lord of the rings board game for example can be played solo, and i would rate the solo play mediocre), and im sure other pure or mainly solo players would agree- they get at least, if not more fun out of the game as mulitplayers do

so yes the game favours two player, and i may be wrong in that the design team doesnt really take into account solo, but if this is the case, then i hope they continue doing what they do, as they are doing a **** fine job of making a two player game soloable gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]

rich

ps as much as id love to see solo only quests- i see only anger from non solo players to come from this….though it would be interesting to see the reaction of the forum given a turn of tides…….i think they should probably stick to what theyre doing and keep working towards good scaling

You know, we're all just shooting in the dark here. Not one of us knows exactly how they choose to implement game ideas. We don't know how much they test each card in 1, 2, 3, or 4 player modes. The fact that we don't know means we really can't say what it was "designed" for. We can have opinions on whether it "scales" best with a given number of players, but that's as far as we can take it.

If somebody does have inside information on design and play testing, this is your cue to post it. (Unless, of course, you've been sworn to secrecy on the matter.)

## 53 [Boris_the_Dwarf on May 24, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/64190-no-hero-in-the-long-dark/?do=findComment&comment=635515)

First off, I'm fine with them designing the game for 2 players. Where I take issue is that they promote the product as being for 1 player as well. It's really not.

When I play with another person, I use the deck that I also run in solo games. The deck has an 80-90% win ratio against any particular scenario. When I play with another person, that player has to bring combat to handle the additional onslaught of enemies that I cannot. In fact, the assistant deck - as I have come to call it - is basically tactics with a lot of ranged so that I can pull an enemy and then my partner can help me kill it. That is his/her role.

So what this means is that when I am in solo mode, I'd better not run the assistant deck as the solo deck because I will lose. And do lose - I have tried to win solo with Tactics + another sphere multiple times and have come to the inevitable conclusion that it simply can't be done. Maybe down the road that will change - Hama was a great addition for Tactics in solo play - but they have a long way to go.

I disagree with the assessment that a game can't be scaled properly for multiple players, starting with one player and going from there. I have about 50 suggestions. I think what has happened is that FFG severely underestimated how popular solo play would be in a board/card game and didn't develop this game correctly. As a result, half or more of all the player cards that come out with each pack are essentially wasted cardboard for people like me, who don't have a lot of free time with friends to spend sitting around the kitchen table hacking through a fantasy-based cooperative card game. The time I spend playing is usually after a long day at work when I am just getting home and needing to unwind. Would I like to be able to use ALL of the cards I PAID for when I play this game? Sure would! Is it realistic to do so? Heck no, not at all!

We've really sidetracked from the topic of this thread, so I'll leave it at that… for now.

having played this since the beginning i can offer some insight on the problems you state above- the thing is you have to take a very different approach when playing solo….as i ve said ive never played any other way- however i still know mulitplayer strategies and support tactics- all this falls apart in solo

i have had a lot of success solo- ive won against all scenarios (except guldur) - however you just have to accept a lower win ration than multiplayer

now onto the case of being able to use all cards- i reccomend you search for a topic i posted a while back in which i raised concern over some cards….im not going to repeat it as i was about torn apart by multiplayers and was even insulted on my income (dont ask)- however i shall give you a link when i find it

try here [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=631266]

i have to say that despite my post i linked there- i dont feel quite the same way now- id certainly say more than half are useful in each pack, in not often all of them

as for sidetracking the thread- i think this one had ran its course anyways given we know there is indeed a hero happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]

Want to hit this point real quick. I am not "complaining" that solo is unbalanced or that the quests are "uber hard" for solo players. As far as I'm concerned, this is only true of Escape from Dol Guldur. The 1B side of the first quest card might as well read: "When Revealed: If you are the only player, you lose the game." But other than that I have beat every scenario at least once, and most of them multiple times. I can even kill both Hill Trolls in Journey to Anduin before they ever engage me almost every time. 

That said, solo players do have a right to complain. We want the entire product that we are buying from them to be useable. I'm to the point that I am about to stop buying if the packs are as junky as the last 3 have been. From them, I have taken Arwyn Undomiel, Elrond's Counsel, and the Gondorian Warden and added them directly to my deck. I would love to use Word of Command but  I'm not making room for Rhadagast just to do that, and Gandalf is too unpredictable to bother with it. Maybe if/when they make more, it will be playable.

I'd even go so far as to say that the Leadership and Tactics cards in the last 2 packs aren't any better than anything I already have in the assistant deck that I hand to my partner when I'm doing a 2-player game. The way I look at it, I paid $5 for the encounter pack and $1 a card for everything else I use. That is just too much IMO. If I had to venture a guess, I'd say the people in charge aren't doing as much playtesting as they should be. They probably don't have the time to do so adequately with a new pack coming out every single month.

I will definitely read that. I don't think a solo player has to accept a lower win rate. I think a solo player has to accept that the game becomes dull very quickly because you can only play the same basic deck over and over again if you want to do well. A lot of people don't get it from what I've seen on these boards, but questing is how you win, in general. Sure there are specific conditions along the way of each quest card - including sometimes killing an enemy - but if you can't overcome the staging area threat each round, you will lose no matter how many enemies you kill or how many allies you have. The first thing I would have done if I were a designer is I would have started the threat level of heroes lower, put willpower at a minimum of 3 instead of 0, and then required the first player to always be the first and last player to flip a card. What this means is that if another player flips an encounter card during the quest phase, then the first player must flip an additional card. I'm sure someone will disagree but IMHO that solves your scaling problems right there. Regardless, what's done is done.

well your opinion is certainly valid….… i just guess its a case of personal opinion

now myself personally….since early may last year ie 12 months ago- i have played many hundreds of games- an embarrising amount some might think- and i havnt got bored once- however this may be down to my strong love for tolkien and the theme- i get alot out of just looking at the artwork- this doesnt work for everyone- especially 'boromir' (likes to win if you werent around for the article) type players

i also havnt got bored of different combos yet- now maybe this is down to me sticking with one type of deck for many games, maybe my 'pippin' side works a bit slower than everyone else- but either way, again its opinion based

Oh, yes, yes. The deck I use in fact is consisted of 24 Spirit cards, 14 Lore cards, 6 Leadership cards and 6 neutral cards with Eowyn, Frodo and Beravor as heroes. Lore is my favorite sphere, but without Spirit I cannot proceed.

I think lore is the most powerful solo sphere. The Minstrels allow you to splash into any other sphere with ease and Bilbo give you constant card draw to lubricate our deck so it has a nice flow, even with crazy mana requirements.

This seams to me to be the best setup for solo…

2xLore + 1xSpirit (my fav)
2xLore + 1xTactics (Also strong)

Do yourself a favour and experiment with swapping Eowyn out for another spirit, say Frodo is a fav of mine.. I will try to not get in this discussion again.. but seriously .. give it a try.

I always play solo too and, although I greatly appreciate richsabre, who is a real gentleman, in this case I have to agree with the majority or, at least, the majority in the last pages of the current topic: when I play solo, I really have no choice; it's either Spirit + whatever or defeat.



I also play solo, but I'm with richsabre here. You have much more time to achieve victory if you lower your threat, and it's clear that if you want to lower your threat, the cards are from Spirit. But it is not so key if you rush through the quest, and look for a quick victory. Anyway, I played juicebox's tournaments successfully using decks without Spirit heros, and sometimes without any threat reduction card. And also lately I used Tactics in some of my decks, having proved useful both Boromir, Elladan or Háma recently for solo play, although obviously using them in bi or tri-sphere decks.

So, it is possible to win without Spirit, and it is possible to win using Tactics, at least in my experience.

Greetings.

agreed on this

also find 2x Lore + 1x Leadership strong as well- both card draw and resource draw mechanisms powering away at once

I prefer to mostly use Spirit instead of Lore, since the event which brings allies out of the discard pile is a Spirit one. This way, I may use expensive Lore allies, such as the Minstrels and the Daughters without much fuss.

My best deck does run 2X lore and 1X spirit, so I can understand where everyone is coming from there. I can also agree that combat is of secondary importance to questing. After all, you must quest every round, but not neccessarily fight every round. Having said that, it sounds like some people think that you cannot win in solo if your deck includes leadership or tactics. I don't get that because this isn't the case, in my experience. While tactics is still a more difficult addition, I have used leadership liberally in many decks throughout both cycles with very good results.

I also don't understand the attitude that some multiplayers have. They act like they know so much more about the game and are so much better than anyone else at it. Yet, it is solo players who tackle quests with nothing more than one deck and their wits, with a more limited card base, since some great multi cards are all but useless in solo, and no partners to rely on.

I believe Tactics can be very powerful addition even in solo play - especially in some quests - but not a leading force; I have built quite a few strong solo decks with one Tactics hero but none with two or three.

But it is hard to play solo without Spirit.

what i usually do to counter a spiritless deck is splash in the key cards such as test of will hasty stroke and UC, couple this with lores rivendell minstrell and you can usually get song cards out quite quick- or alternatively use narvis belt in a dwarf deck

ive had a fair bit of succes this way- for instance i have just had an easy win against watcher in the water using lore strider, bilbo and gloin, with a bit of spirit  sprinkled in

I meant that. Not without a Spirit hero but without Spirit cards. A Test of Will is just so very needed in some quests that it is hard to do without. I really hope we get a new mean of cancelling "when revealed" or even "forced" effects in a different sphere (Lore, perhaps), well, you can avoid those with Denethor but still…

I agree.  I want to see something like "Dunedain Sentinal" - Discard to cancel the "When revealed" of an encounter card.  (Or even better, exhaust to!  But that's probably too much.)

Haha, I was just saying we agree.

Yeah, I think we may see another card that cancels "when revealed." It is an interesting development between "when revealed" and shadow effects. In the core set we only had one card, Hasty Stroke, for the latter and two, A Test of Will and Eleanor, for the former. Since, we have got A Burning Brand, Dunedain Watcher, Dawn Take You All, Rider of the Mark, all dealing with shadow effects; but nothing new that deals with "when revealed."

I have, and it has always ended in disaster. I've even compared round to round what would have happened if I had run Eowyn instead of Frodo. Without exception, I have noted that I finish the quest faster with Eowyn, and more often than not, my threat skyrockets with Frodo on the team - this is not because of his ability, either; it's because I fall behind in questing very quickly. When you go from putting a token or 2 on the location card every round to having to raise your threat by 1-2 points every round, what happens is that you are not clearing the staging area. What it boils down to is that you need 1 quester, 1 blocker, and 1 attacker when choosing heroes. Obviously, it's nice if the heroes can do other things to, but those are the primary requirements. What role does Frodo play, exactly? Is he the blocker? Then who is the quester? Frankly, there's no one else that can quest as great as Eowyn, and certainly not at her threat cost. I'd rather tap down one character and hold the line on the quest stage than tap down 2-3 characters leaving me less to block and attack with, and then still not at least hold the line on the quest stage. 

1 game - the most memorable example - I compared round to round what would happen if I had kept Eowyn instead of Frodo. With Eowyn, I won the game in 5 rounds. My final threat was 20. (My starting threat was 24.) With Frodo, I lost the game in 12 rounds with a final threat of 39 (My starting threat, by the way, was 22). What was the difference? I couldn't keep pace on questing because I was having to fight too much stuff. Eowyn could hold the line, freeing up 2 other characters to block and attack. But with Frodo on the team it took everything to do what Eowyn was doing on her own, and I couldn't spare it for the 2 rounds I needed to clean-up the enemies that were engaging me. What was the quest, you ask? Passage to Mirkwood. The entry level adventure. I'll go get a sandwich while I let that sink in.

@lleimmoen - thats an intersting point you make - i was about to say at first 'cancellation is a spirit thing, it wouldnt go with any other sphere' but then i realised you're right- there are a good few shadow cancellation cards across the spheres! i think its because treachery cancellation is much more powerful in general

@boris - thats also an interesting post- however i have noted the opposite! as soon as i ditched the rather lovely eowyn i started winning more….and i mean a whole lot more…..there are players who swear by her, and some hate her….i am about in the middle- i see her use, especially for solo as she opens up a slot for a fighter/defender, but i also see other just as good (or in my opinion better) strategies

…for instance that 'slot' could be freed up by a unexpected courage hero, or a fast hitched (and buffed up with protector of lorien) hobbit, or again map maker with a ton of resources spent to buff him up to double eowyns base willpower…another favourite willpower killer of mine is dain, bifur and gloin, with a few dwarf allies….each one of them gettting dains +1 willpower really adds up

the draw back to my own plans are of course you have to buy them cards…thus alot of my games are slow to start then really take off

What you say makes sense, but it's also different than boored's "challenge." You can't just drop Eowyn for Frodo. You have to rework your entire starting lineup. And you sacrifice willpower, which is the only viable way to quest (Legolas notwithstanding). I guess I'd have to watch someone else play these alternate cards/decks to understand it, but in my experience, slow starts in solo games = auto-loss.

yes you do really have to switch alot around, i dont think its as simple as a pure swap of heros

but with a good start hand (or taking a mulligan which is a great ability) it can really work out- and of course with a big card draw technique you soon draw your wanted cards anyways- so often it isnt so slow, especially with bilbo (who for that matter is my favourite hero)

anytime you change a hero you need to redesign teh deck,I can not belive this even needs to be stated

When the game first appeared I did not want to play with Éowyn, I am not even sure why, I just didn't… Only after I have seen many people being in awe I tried her up and was very happy for a long time. I had much success and still run her frequently. But I believe there are many ways, as for solo, I find the two Hobbits and Denethor a really interesting way of winning quests. The start can be very slow and hard but once the deck gets going, it is very powerful as it can predict pretty much every outcome of the staging. I have been advertising this deck for a while, so regular readers are probably rolling their eyes reading this but for someone who is not (beginners, for instance) I shall be happy to give out some hints about how to build and play this deck.

So when you challenged people to try out someone other than Eowyn, what you were really saying is that people should just build different decks?
