If I have a card that let's me perform an action when exhausted, can I exhaust for committing to a quest or combat at the same time with the same card? In other words can I get two actions with one exhaust?

Thanks

Can you specify what card?

In general, unless a card ability requires a card to exhaust, you can use it on an exhausted card.

By "let's me perform an action when exhausted" do you mean something that says "Exhaust [card] to..." ? If so, no. You have to exhaust the card for that effect separately to exhausting them for anything else.

Exhaustion is a payment in LCG speak. If the action says "exhaust [card(s), type, whatever] to…", exhausting that card only pays for that action, but a reaction saying "when a card of type X is exhausted" could react to that if the exhausted card is type X. This could trigger a whole chain of reactions, really.
