Inspired by iznax:

 

It's always interesting to see the Top 5 list of different people, as we have currently a threat about top 5 I am veeery interested to see the Top 5 fail tests in your opinion with explanation.

I realy like all the quests so far, so if i have to say 5 ''fails'', i will put quests that you need a specific, deck buildning/strategy, and luck based quests, so heres mine.

 

1. Journey to Rhosgobel. Heal for the win :/

 

2. Road to Rivendell. 2 cards (and theyr timing) determins victory or defeat ''almost''

 

3. The Rdhorn Gate. Low will power (and 0) Heroes and allys not welcome :/

 

4&5 2nd & 3rd HoN quests. I love this game and i realy like those 2, but lets be honest, the luck of the draw determins victory or defeat, NOT your strategy NOT your deck building  :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

1. The Hill's of Emyn Muil - Yes its good artwork, rather fun I think, but its a fail of a quest.  So easy.  

 

2. Redhorn Gate is a fail when you keep losing all your victory point locations.  

 

3. Over the Misty Mountains Grim - Way too easy solo.  Goblin King is a joke, and with only 2 quest stages, With a good deck, I beat this quest in 4 MAYBE 5 rounds ALL day.  

 

4. I don't really like we must away ere break of day since it to me just doesn't feel exciting and too similar to Carrok and I just don't like it.  

 

Other than that, the rest are good.

i cant bring myself to say anything bad about this game....i love it too much :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

but seriously, like iznax there are no quests i call bad, none that i even dislike. however these are the quests at the bottom of my like list (see what i did there? :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png])

 

1. the riddle quest. great idea, i just didnt like the way it turned out...perhaps i just got annoyed with it at the start.

2. shadow and flame. its a bit linear, which of course is the idea but its a bit too linear

3. rhosgobel is luck based as has been already pointed out

the remaing two are

return to mirkwood and dol guldur, because of the fact they are so unbalanced when you change the amount of players.

 

@khamul - try mountain grim 2 handed- seriously it gets a lot harder (well a little harder) and may take it off your bottom list :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] ....also, its interesting to see my top quest in your bottom 5....different tastes i guess

I said Redhorn Gate is one of the worst quest ONLY WHEN you keep losing those victory point locations and it takes 12-20 turns.  Otherwise it's awesome quest

## 6 [richsabre on July 17, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86511-your-top-5-epic-fail-quests/?do=findComment&comment=815993)

certainly one for the end comes, risk some light, or shadow of the past. with a secrecy deck you can often leave enemies in staging so you dont risk shadow cards

But then it turns into having to build a deck with plenty of willpower, willpower boosting, cards that get things back from the encounter discard and stuff and it just turns into a mess and I don't like having to change my whole deck just to play that quest so that bad stuff usually does happen.  But I usually make sure to play RG when I have a good Lore deck or something

the majority of my decks go towards the heavy questing naturally, so thats another reason why its probably my favourite. i have to say in all the games i have played against redhorn gate, i have rarely lost victory points through shadow cards...perhaps i have been lucky

I read this post a different way, I thought it was about our worst failures at a quest, so that's how I'm going to answer it.

So last night, my buddy and I were playing The Steward's Fear. He hadn't beaten it yet and wanted to really badly. So, I played with a Mono-Leadership Outlands deck to ensure an easy victory. By the end of the game I was committing 39 Willpower to the quest, so we were obviously doing well. However, we got the 'burning Minas Tirith' Plot card and Telemnar's Bane which combo to reduce your deck towards a loss if it gets depleted. We're getting up to 5 discards per turn and we draw the False Lead card which stops us from an easy victory. My deck is getting down there (I started with exactly 50 cards since I didn't have good card draw) and I foolishly play A Very Good Tale and end up depleting 5 cards from my deck. My friend calls me on it and points out that I only have 6 cards left in my deck. I say, "Psssh, I'm so confident we're going to win, there's no way were drawing that other False Lead we have in the deck..."

 

Guess what happened!?!
At the end of the turn we had to discard exactly 6 cards and my deck ran out and we lost the game.

 

EPIC FAIL

I really meant it like Rich etc. answered, but interesting to read your story.

 

FLOP 5:

 1. Dungeons Deep and Caverns Grim: I cannot apreciate this quest, absolutely not. Luck-factor is incredible, even WITH a former specially for this quest constructed deck. I tend to draw 4 goblins in the first 2 round, so not only a difficult riddle-situation but also an insane amount of encounters each round.
 2. Into Ithilien: If I hadn't been so shocked about the riddles when they first were published, Into Ithilien surely would have been in first place. It's a quest which gives me 0% fun when I play it, I hate it.
 3. The Battle for Laketown: It's ridiculous. That's all.
 4. The Watcher in the Water: This AP I played not very often, cause it's not so innovative like certain other quests. Since I am more a lore-player, battle is not what I like so much and here it's focused on fighting, It wouldn't be a problem if the tentacles hadn't those ridiculous forced effects and almost every card in the deck had either a shadow effect or is a tentacle.Regardless, the Watcher himself is very cool.
 5. Conflict at the Carrock: To put it in a nutshell the same reasons like Watcher in the Water.

1) The Hills of Emyn Muil: simply a snooze-fest. There's really nothing exciting about traveling in this game.

 

2) The Long Dark/The Dead Marshes: both, to me, are equally forgettable quests.

 

3) Riddles/Burgle quest: Not necessarily bad quests, in the traditional sense of the word, but quests I don't re-play very often.

 

4) All of the KD quests: again, largely forgettable for me.

 

5) The Steward's Fear: The Hills of Emyn Muil 2.0 (slightly better, but for me, not by much. theme isn't enough to promote it off the list).

1) Hill of Emyn Muil this is just a waste of card board. I have no idea what the designers were even thinking here. My guess is that they wanted to make a questing orientated quest with low combat requirements.. but that is kind of hard in a strait up combat game such as this.

 

2) Steward's Fear was such a let down after HON. We go from awesome challenging quests that make me sit for hours in the deck builder trying, tweaking and getting crushed then slowly finding paths and ideas that unlock wins to auto winning on my first time with no deck adjustments. This pack was so depressing I am pretty sure I will not longer be getting cycle packs. Instead I am going to switch to Saga and Nightmare PnP releases of my fav old quests.

 

3) Passage Through Mirkwood (Normal) This quest is unplayable. It was ok when we just had core and the game is new, though I played it twice and moved to the 2 good quests. It is dull, easy, quick and pointless. Much like Hills and Steward.

 

4) The Hobbit 1. These just sucked so badly. I got them for the player cards. There was some nice ideas in these packs but I call it a complete fail. Hobbit 2 was much better but as they were designed together suffers much of the same unforgivable choices. I do like the idea of these packs though and expect the next one to be better. Still these are not so much terrible quests as in such a disappointment I just can not bring myself to open the box again.

 

5) The entire game in retard mode. Removing key cards from the quests is so lame I do not know where to start. I appreciate that they are doing it this way instead of watering down the content for people that like to play games. Still this entire "mode" is a total fail. I strains my mind that people play it.

I actually really agree.  It ruins the quest's when you take out cards that were supposed to be in the quest when first designed.

then don't play it that way! to call those that do a "retard" or claim that it "strains your mind" is absurd.

 

this reminds me of wil wheaton's number one gaming group rule: 

 

"Arcades were more than just magnificent geek Shangri-Las, filled with all sorts of video games and pinball machines. They were a vital part of my generation’s social development. If I beat another kid in a two player game and taunted him mercilessly, with explicit references to his mother's sex life and my role in it, the way some online gamers do today, he would have justifiably kicked the everliving **** out of me. So I learned – in arcades – the importance of good sportsmanship. Because arcades were real places, staffed by real people, we had to worry about much more than getting kicked off a server if we were complete idiots in a game. I guess this is a double-edged sword, and I’m feeling like a cranky old man by even mentioning it, but would you all do me a favor? When you’re playing online, have fun, and don’t be a ****, okay?"

 

you'd never call someone playing easy mode - in real life - a "retard" - and if you did, you'd quickly find yourself with few human companions.

Hey hey now I'm not going that far. I never said people were retards.  Just agree that it ruins the quest by playing easy mode since it takes out the heart of the quest almost always.  Just no fun in the game when you win super easy no problem every time.  I suppose I should have been more specific saying what I agree on.  I don't think people who do easy mode are retards, I just think that they aren't playing the game correctly like everyone else plays it and how it was made.  And sure they can play all the easy mode they want, but they arn't going to get the real fun out of the game.

 

 I hope you don't think I would say a thing like that,

no, my comment wasn't directed towards you, specifically.

 

but, since easy mode is "official," i would say that those who chose to play easy mode aren't playing it "incorrectly" any more than someone playing nightmare mode is playing "incorrectly." some folks like easy quests (hence some folks thinking Hills of Emyn Muil is the best quest!). different strokes, different folks!

 

you've never been anything but polite on the forums - so no, i'd not think you'd agree with the less-than-civil attitudes of others on these boards. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Yes sure  easy mode for them and Nightmare mode for other but........

 

to be true in my experience good game is a game which is consantrate on something certain. When you try to satisfied any player then the trouble begin.  Cose there is 2 way casual game or Proff game. there is no third way. Now this game is more casual.

But im happy with nightmare mode and i happy since desighners is doing righ think for the game now. Cose proff. players they are most buying players . All this casual players they always change, buy core and couple of pack and go.

 

Boored can talk very straight sometimes but he is say right thinks. i can see the guy have a lot experience with a different card games so any proff player like him will speak the same.

The problem is most of the players here is just a Rookies or not sport oriented people. they never really play serious tournaments so they sometimes dont really understand what proff players say. And you cannot blame them since they just dont have enough experince and also they dont care much, they approach to the game is a really not deep.

 

They dont want spend time to think how to build up the decks so they just wonna relax dont think much and win all the time with out any trouble. That why we have a easy mode now. But most funny think for me this kind of players they feel insult why easy mode?? What is mean?? bla bla bla........... like a kids.......

 

So as i say before: dont need to talk to them  since there is no point  Boored. they cannot  understand you, but they can be insulted! To understand they should to past the way what you past already.

I type all that mostly for practice my English first of all.

5.  Hills.  Art is pretty good but it seems more like a Northern Tracker or lose, at least when playing with cards available at the time(with all the willpower from Dain and Outlands not so much anymore).

 

4. Road to Rivendell.  This quest had some promise, but having a quest with basically two cards that end the game unless you have a Cancel card is pretty lame.

 

3. Redhorn Gate/Dead Marshes.  These two quests are fine as long as the cards you NEED aren't discarded/come up as Shadows.  They scream for erratas like the Troll key/Purse got, meaning if they are discarded, add them to the staging area.

 

2.  Steward's Fear.  I like a lot of the ideas in this quest, just don't feel the urge to play it, mostly because it can be so slow, especially solo if locations aren't coming as much as you'd like.  Can have 3 turns or more with no progress on the quest.  Love the boss fight and underground though, so maybe I am being harsh.

 

1. Dungeons Deep.  Riddle effect is way too random, basically need to build a deck to be used for that quest and that quest only(different than Rhosgobel, as you really just need to throw a few ranged/healing cards in, but this needs a much more specific deck.)  I like the quest stages and the idea of the riddles, just think it could have been done a bit better/made it easier to pass the riddles(didn't Bilbo dominate the riddles anyway?) :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

 

I think it's a bit silly for guys on this board to say how Easy Mode is 'fail.'  It was not designed for people like us that play the game all the time, know all the cards/strategies, have played/beaten every quest.  Clearly it would be boring for people that don't think the game is that hard in general(however removing two cards of Sleeping Sentry is pretty much best idea ever).  It was designed for new players that I see all the time on BGG complaining how hard the game is.  It was designed to make it easier on new players to ease them into the game and not feel overwhelmed, which I think it did a great job of.  It was never advertised as a new, exciting mode for experienced players.

I agree with you, Matthew.

I dont understand why people are crying so much about the Easy-Mode. If you dont like it, then dont play it, where is the problem? I dont like Nightmare-Mode, so I wont play it; but do I complain about FFG creating more interesting and difficult cards for experienced players? No! I am also an advanced player, so what?

Analising the quest "Siege for Cair Andros" I tried Easy Mode, but I can tell you, it got a lot more difficult!!! At least if you play with mono tactics, cause some cards which were not so bad for that tactic got removed and the encounter deck is very very thin.

I totally apreciate Easy Mode, as I do Nightmare. For myself I will continue with Normal-Mode. To all the people like Khamul and Glaurung I can only advise to become more cosmopolitan...

this is just plain rubbish. i've been playing CCGs since 1995 or 1996 (gah - can't remember which!) and I have never called anyone a "retard" or said that a certain style of play "strains my brain" or claimed that a certain type of player could never "understand me" because I'm better than they are.

 

everyone in the States (at least) is taught from a very early age: "if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all' - this doesn't mean that you can't criticize or comment on things that you don't like but you can do it in a grown-up way.

 

i just feel sorry for a person that feels the need to cower behind a keyboard and get some sort of kick out of calling people "retards." again, if we were in a local game store all playing LOTR:LCG - i know, without a doubt, that's the kind of attitude that would sour the group and many/most wouldn't want to play with a person like that.

 

you can be an "expert" and have class all at the same time; they are not mutually exclusive concepts. glaurung - you are just flat wrong to insinuate otherwise.

 

but, now i've highjacked the thread and derailed it, so i think that's all i'll say.

I become very sad when I read your opinion. So - when I play Easy-Mode f.i. I cannot understand you and everyone can insult me? wow! Glaurung, is it your russian education or do you really blame players when they want to have fun in a game? :-(

Matthew rules haha.

 

I think a great part of this community agrees with you Matthew.  I can really only think of one member that is just overall negative towards the game, it seems like he doesn't really enjoy it at all, 90% negative posts.  There is a difference between criticism and being rude, which I think some of the members here don't understand.  But yes, I agree this thread has been officially derailed.  Bound to happen with a Bottom 5 quest poll, it's too bad, as the discussion itself is a decent one, but some members need to resort to harsh namecalling and pretentiousness.

In an effort to get the thread back on track...

 

As a mainly solo player, I would say (In no particular order):

 

Escape from dol guldur. I think the general idea is interesting, but it just doesn't scale well, so playing this solo puts you at a far greater disadvantage than playing with two or more players. After I'd hammered away at this to finally get a couple of solo wins, I put it back in its box and don't ever really play it.

 

Return to Mirkwood. Again, as a solo player, this hits you way too fast. I think this would have worked better if some of the effects, like how much threat you gain, had been in some way based on the number of players in the game.

 

Journey to Rhosgobel. I just don't enjoy this quest. Any quest that heavily influences how you need to build your deck to stand a chance just isn't fun, as it limits the strategies you can employ.

 

Dungeons Deep and Caverns Dim. Similar to the above, the riddles mean you need to build your deck in a certain way...and also in solo you wind up milling through your deck really quickly, so you either deck yourself or need to play spirit and will of the west.

 

And to be honest i struggle to think of a fifth I don't like. I'm not a great fan of the mirkwood cycle, as I just feel like they were finding their feet. I loved Khazadum, and the whole Dwarrodelf cycle. I enjoy Heirs (though I look forward to trying it once we have all the player cards from the cycle), and so far the new cycle is entertaining. I like the theme of the hobbit boxes.

I suppose the only one that consistently gives me great trouble is laketown. But I don't dislike it, I just find it challenging.

 

Generally though, every since Khazadum, I think the design of the quests is just going from strength to strength, and I love how thematic they are becoming - battlegrounds removing quest stages in seige of cair andros, for example.

I'm changing my list:

 

1) The Hills of Emyn Muil: simply a snooze-fest. There's really nothing exciting about traveling in this game.

 

2) The Long Dark/The Dead Marshes: both, to me, are equally forgettable quests.

 

3) Riddles/Burgle quest: Not necessarily bad quests, in the traditional sense of the word, but quests I don't re-play very often.

 

4) All of the KD quests: again, largely forgettable for me.

 

5) Encounter at Amon Din: Far, far too easy. But beyond that, it's a rarity that villager ever dies. There's no tension in the quest, little chance for failure, and winning it is very anti-climactic. All in all, a huge disappointment - especially since the idea behind it is so cool. There should have been a "Dead Villagers X" keyword that killed X villagers each round, where X = number of players and perhaps every encounter card should have somehow killed villagers. As it is now, in all the games I've played, the total Dead is around 1/3 of the total Rescued and it's never even close. Such a shame.

This prisoner mechanism in this quest is very similar but unlike the villiger one.. it in fact works.

 

Also it had what we now come to know as treasures...

Remember this is why before Hobbit was even announced.

 

Or even better... Fenox's Raid on the River Camen has villages.

I think a lot of people really do not look at the customs.. many of them are vastly superior to official FFG ones. Not all, but the real good ones are made by fans and address issues fans have.. and are thus very very good.

There's no tension in the quest, little chance for failure, and winning it is very anti-climactic. All in all, a huge disappointment - especially since the idea behind it is so cool. There should have been a "Dead Villagers X" keyword that killed X villagers each round, where X = number of players and perhaps every encounter card should have somehow killed villagers. As it is now, in all the games I've played, the total Dead is around 1/3 of the total Rescued and it's never even close. Such a shame.

Wow now you sounds much more realistic.

Agree with you on many points. But nightmare mode can change a lot as already done for core set quests. I really like all quests but some of them now to easy and boring yo play them again. Nightmare should change it at least i hope for this.

You know i do not pay attention to fans quest since they are mostly is unbalanced and there is no good taste play before they come out.

Sounds like you try many of th do you? I try one from Fenix Barrow bla bla bla and it eas so boring and easy ( not even worse time what i spend with sizzler and paper).

Also Ninja dorg quests was not really impresive for me. So i stop to pay attention to any fans quests.

Maybe you can suggest some? Probably i miss something good a?

Dain, re: Amon Din, how many times have you played?  I agree the first few times I played I won pretty easily, but had my most recent round suuuuper close.  I let an attack go undefended(was forced to), and at the end I only won by 1 villager.  It was quite tense.

 

I think the art in Amon Din is maybe the best so far as well.

I didn mean that. And as a man i cannot be insult bu the wolrd on the forum in internet. But.....yes im russian is true. Im glad at last some can  see it...... And i dont wont insult you and dont worry words cannot hurt me too. I straight in my thinking and i say what i see without bla bla bla. I respect power and proff. and dont care about other since is just waste of time.

I love nightmare mode since on that level game is really dangerous and in my opinion that how Tolkien game is should be.

Im happpy with easy mode cose is mean main stream will be at least same.

But im wonder when one who cry for easy mode get insult cose they dont like name EASY MODE. Ha ha ha we wont every things more easy but not call that easy since we insult. I mean that only. That what wonder me.

Tolkien book is book about frendship, Duty Adventures, Perils and Power of Darknes and hopeless. there is no EASY MODE! 

Feelings when you play and every decision can cost you a game, when you can lost a hero and even if you have a powerful cards in play you still dont know since a lot of surge effect and enemies is powerful that what give a Nightmare! and that hpow is Should to be in Tolkien game! Not easy mode is not for me for sure!

 

Anyway i think better we stop tihis and continiue our topic theme.

what's interesting is Fenox is now a designer for the game. He did an interview with COTR where he talks about the differences in designing custom vs. "official" guests. If you haven't listened, I think it's worth a shot.

All of you ''pro'' players, if you have the need to prove something, just go and play a competitive game (there are so many) and let the rest of us enjoy this great CO-OP game, ''easy'' mode is a great idea from people that create games and not people who just saying that they are great players etc in a forum and no one gives a F**K

 

PS just for the record i play standar mode over easy and nightmare

Most of my epic fails are from pushing to far. I have no real stories I can just retell.. but the general jist of it is that I have a choice to play safe, or push my luck.. and then I loose on a card flip.. one I could have survived if I was just a little more careful!!! I call this a epic fail. haha...

 

When the quest is hard and it stomps me, or I get a Turn 1 Triple R (Resign, Reshuffle and Re-deal!) That is just the game doing what is is designed to... but epic fail? Well that is always my fault.. Pushing to hard, over questing by not counting my will correctly, failing to notice an additive effect of a card invalidating the win at the last round.. HA! That an epic fail.. winning a brutal quest and then your mate goes.. um.. hang on... . we should have lost ages ago!

 

But I guess if I had to pick then most of my great experiences that sound  like some of the other posts in this thread have been during Escape, now with nightmare mode it is even worse (better). So many near scrapes where you think you are finally going to make it only to be trashed without mercy.  The base difficulty of that quest makes it so tense when you have nearly won that a fail near the end is always epic! Then just when it was getting manageable for Solo, 2v2 and 3v3 (those are the only modes I play) out comes NIGHTMARE!! hehee awesome!

ha! I know him in real life.. trust me he talks like that right to peoples faces. It is just the way he is. In fact I would say it is turned down on the forum as every second word isn't an F or C swear word.

My greatest epic fail was playing at The Steward's Fear. I played with 2 players more. I had the outlanders deck and i drawed a lot of cards. When we pass to 2a, my deck had 20 cards only. And the Plot it displayed this time was... Up in Flames!!! We lost last round to win because my deck became without cards.

Other friends got a lot of angry with me :angry: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_angry.png] . Lol, and that was the game that i wanted to show them the power of outlander deck, lol :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] . I have just bought the new adventure Stewrad Fear.

 

 

Well, for me, the most dificult adventures are:

 

1. Laketown if you play in 3 players mode or more.

2. To Ithilien. Insane, No way, alone or 4 players!

3. Dol Guldur, if you play alone.

4. Flies and Spiders. You have to suffer a lot! With players or alone.

5. Cair Andros. 3 players or more.

Are you sure about Laketown? I had i game 3 players it was easy like hell......So we decide not to play this one anymore since it was to easy and if it easy is boring. Maybe we just was lucky?

My top 5 fail quests are:

 

 

1. Journey to a Hospital

 

One of the few quests that can be done within three turns! I think this was the game which first showed how important card draw is in this game. Led to the first excesses of Unexpected Beravor. *shudders*

 

 

2. The Hobbit Riddle Festival

 

Annoying. I wanna buy an "e".

 

 

3. No Return to Mirkwood

 

Simply unplayable for solo players. One of the best opponents so far, but no time to fight it.

 

 

4. In Search of the Goblin King

 

Oops, where is he? Did he use The Ring to disappear? Are my eyes closed? No, I accidently slew him.

 

 

5. The Hills and the Hills and the Hills of Emyn Muil

 

zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz

I just don't understand why people think this is SUPER hard solo and just stupid.  I beat it with a Leadership Aragorn, Lore Glorfindell, Theodred deck 5/6 times.  Now I did get some pretty lucky card draw not getting huge enemies most of the games, but if you don't get a big enemy, this quest is easy.  Just quest 3-4 rounds, use cards to keep your threat low, and you win.  I think of it as a "If you draw big enemy you lose, if you don't you win" and thats certainly how it goes for me.  Its not that hard with the Lore cards now days to control not getting big enemies.  

 

I think its quite fun solo.  And its one of the best quests ever for multiplayer.

I agree with you. If you have a threat reduction and if you didn get the enemies in the begin it realy easy. Yes is playable solo for sure. But this quest is really unbalaced. Very interesting idea but very poorly done by mechanic. And is not only one. Dead Marches the same. very interesting and promising sounds escape test. But when you play to boring and easy. And if Gollum shuffle back in the deck is annoying like hell (pray he will not come as a shadow card). I hope nightmare will change it and bring all old quest to the new life and challenge.

I'm judging the scenarios by the card pool we had when they were released and I played them a lot. To win RtM you have to build a deck that relies on threat reduction. Nowadays you can use Loragorn, but at the time the adventure was released he was still in the woods or some unknown village pub.  Elrond's Counsel also wasn't out at the time RtM was released. Second, if you draw "Attercop, Attercop" you have basically lost the game. I had a dozen games or so in which I did all I could do to defeat the spider beast, but only managed to do so once, as my threat ran out in all of the other games. It's annoying to have such a challenging enemy but not being able to fight it.

 

My main problem with RtM is that the designer could have easily avoided the threat problem by adding an additional rule for solo players. "At the end of the turn the starting player raises his threat by X, where X is the number of players." RtM could have been such a great quest, but with its designer flaw it lost lot of its potential. That's why I call it a fail  -not because the quest is that bad.

Yes , we try to win at Laketown and never we can. A lot of locations are put on, and it is impossible to quest at finish.

Ahem, you can't be serious about comparing SF to HoEM! These are completely different quests. HoEM is all about questing AFAP. SF is about creating a strategy that allows you to make progress, defend against some of these nasty AtS enemies and to prepare yourself for each of the possible plots.

The only threat reduction I ever used when I was using a Leadership Lore deck (Without Loragorn) was 1 gandalf, and like I said I beat the quest 5/6 times.  I'm glad that the rule is to raise your threat by 4 since it would be too easy otherwise.  Makes you have to rush to thruanduil's palace as fast as you can, cuz if you stall, big bad enemies will get you.  If you didn't have the huge threat raising for solo, you could just take your time defeating enemies and walk your way to the palace with  your huge group of allies.  I think RtM is a very good quest solo and multiplayer.  It's much different solo, like how all the Mirkwood cycle quests were very different from each other.

I disagree with you - THoEM is about racking up enough location VPs to win and TSF is about cleaning 8 locations to pass the quest stages - I find that extremely similar.

the enemies are a joke and very easy to deal with and the plots/villains have never been much of a problem with solid deck construction.

both quests are focused heavily on location clearing - which is somewhat dull.

note that I don't call them identical - I think TSF is a notch above THoEM - but only barely for me. it's an artificially slow quest - like THoEM due to all of the locations you must clear and the enemies pose little threat in most of the games I've played.

I think SF is quite difficult quest....but sure if you buildup the deck against certain quest yes this is make whole game easy.

try to bulid up deck which is play again any quest. is much more challenge and interesting.  Make a deck agaisnt specific quest is a bit boring a?

i've never built a deck for this quest and i don't typically build decks to beat particularly quests. i've played this one multiple times and it's always been "easy."

I actually find this quite interesting: that different quests seem to vary so much in how people find them in terms of difficulty. For myself, Steward's Fear was quite tricky, with the plots in particular giving me a really hard time, but honestly I've never found Into Ithilien, even before the errata, to be that nasty. Certainly not to the level that some find. I also find Massing at Osgiliath not so bad - but Battle of Five Armies, and even, for some reason, Watcher in the Water, destroy me.

 

I've wondered why this is: why does it seem that play style can so drastically effect this? It's really interesting to me that, for example, Dain and Glaurung see Steward's Fear so differently.

same. I don't see why people think its crazy hard.  Its really not that bad.  It's hard, yes, but I can win it a fair amount of the time.

If you keep getting shadow or tetencle shadow effects on thrashing tentacle, you whole party can be destroyed before long.  Many times I play this quest and get thrashing tentacle first round and i attack it like 5 times and keep getting shadow or tentecles every attack so I have to deal loads of damage to my squad and I just cant do anything.  Its quite annoying.

if i remember correctly, glaurung said earlier that all of the quests this cycle are too easy - so i was just as surprised as you are to see him backtrack a bit on this quest!

i dunno if you've been playing 2+ player, or not, but into ithilien is one of those quests is that is substantially easier solo, than multiplayer (like the druadan forest, as well).

It's about cleaning eight active locations, so you can't circumvent the quest with NT or Asfaloth. And under most locations you find enemies that are far away from being easy (beside the Pickpocket), so clearing locations in the staging area doesn't really help, as most enemies have a similar threat as the location. And let's not forget all these nasty treacheries and the plots. You just don't quest here, but you quest and you prepare yourself for any possible enemy to come up from the underground. And pray that you don't draw sewers when you're short of defenders.

 

I can beat this scenario with Outlands and with a special lore mono deck and I gues dwarfs should also do fine, but my current leadership/spirit deck gets crushed all the time. Boromir ain't happy!

I guess he smoked some crack when he said that. SF isn't easy at all, DF is a fun and challenging quest (just don't play it with Outlands etc), and even EaAD is entertaining, though not perfect.

i know how the quest works, silly. :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

 

and it's still very easy, and largely dull. just like The Hills (for me). the plots and villian happen too late to really matter much, and in my play-throughs, it's over in a round or two after they are revealed. and i still think all the enemies are easy. never once have they posed a significant problem.

 

but to each his own! it's very interesting to see how different folks react to different quests.

 

at the end of the day - for me - it's not a quest i'll bust out to play very often.

 

p.s.: should i bother pointing out i took TSF off my "worst" list after playing Encounter at Amon Din? haha.

Actually i think is about heroes.  I mean which heroes you choose to play. That what make some quests easy and some more difficult. For example Thorin companu deck can be good almost against all quests. But siege of Cair adros is really difficult for this deck. Even if i win i never ever can expolre battleground locations so i hane a long way. SF is quite easy for TH Company unless you didn get a certain plot....... My Elrond deck can explore BG locations in SOCA and much more easy win this quest but SF is almost impossible to win.......

I love SF is quite cool . Plot cards is really cool!

 

Druadan and Amon looks easy solo so im not so happy with that.

BUt sometink tell me last 3 quest should be hard. Last one for sure about 8. Osgiliath looks very promising maybe 7. BOG also should be not less then 6.

Yesterday we played Into Ithilien again. 3 players. Its insane (although constructing special decks for it), i hate it and I have 0% fun playing it.

I love this way. When you win you feel cool. Is not  point to win easy......there should be struggle....

Into Ithilian I usually play two-handed (which, I realise, isn't quite the same as two-player), and I really enjoy the quest. Not as much as Peril in Pelargir, which is just so well designed it's almost always a great game. The key may be that I really favour archery heavy decks, and those can make it so much easier to cope early on etc with the enemies. The other quest I find really oddly hard is the first AP of the Mirkwood cycle. Can't explain why, but I often get a pasting against it.
