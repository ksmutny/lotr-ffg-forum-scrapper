Hi everybody,

just a little question.

the location says:

The current quest card gains siege.

This is not a 'When Revealed' option

 

so, when should I apply the siege? when I do the voyage? or immediately?

The Cross-roads is part of the setup, so it's going to be in place at the very start of the game. That's why it doesn't have a "When revealed," it won't be revealed ever. Any questing you do while it is in play is going to be siege.
