I'm playing the Redhorn Gate  last night and used Asfoloth to explore it rather than travel to it   I'm reading here on the forums that when Stage 2 was completed, I should've fished Caradhras out of the Victory Display and made it the active location.  Is this an official ruling?  Or just some seasoned player's interpretation?

It is in the FAQ
 

> Q: If Caradhras (DD 15) is in my victory display when I complete stage 2 of The Redhorn Gate, will it become the active location even though it is not in play?

> A: Yes. You will remove Caradhras from your victory display and put it back into play as the active location. Cards in the victory display are not removed from the game and can still be referenced by effects. If players get too far ahead of themselves via card effects, they’ll find a return journey is necessary!

I didn't see that initially.  Thank you.

No problem.  It's hard to keep track of everything at this point :lol: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_laugh.png]
