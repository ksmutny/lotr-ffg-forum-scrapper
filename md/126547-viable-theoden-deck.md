Theoden has always been one of my favorite heroes just because his ability is so odd and unique. Building a good deck around him has been tough but I finally built one that really shows just how amazing he can be. To be honest solo the deck doesn't work as well because a lack of essential leadership abilities. Overall though I have beat the whole HoN cycle and expansion. Which I found most interesting because I did not change 1 card in my decks and had no trouble alternating between siege, battle and normal questing which is something that can generally cause a bit of trouble.

Basically I attach Steed of the Mark to Mablung and Theoden and with SoG and Mablung's resource generation plus Theodred I never lack for resources on them. Between the two tactics heroes they can pay for all the expensive Eagle allies and Support of the Eagles really buffs up their power. With Steed of the Mark and LoV I can quest for 9 and have all 3 of those heroes still ready for combat.

The second deck is basically a support deck that basically has everything the other deck lacks. Card draw, healing location management.

Nice deck :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]  You might want to post in the deck building section though so people can find it later when looking for decks.

Wow, nice decks!! As a fellow two handed player well done creating two decks that compliment and support each other so well :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Trying to make a solo Theoden deck, which should have a Spirit hero... maybe Eowyn or Glorfindel. And Eomer to take care of combat. I think it's worth the threat having extra willpower while still having two tactics heroes. Could work.

Yeah I think the inherent problem with Theoden is the more tactics heroes you have the better his ability is but you need a way to ready otherwise you are wasting them because you could get the same amount of willpower out of other heroes with less threat. Therefore you need access to other spheres to ready the tactics heroes and get full use of their mainly combat abilities. When tactics Aragorn comes out I will substitute him for Glorfindel and add a spirit hero to the other deck probably replacing Haldir. This way I could have a tri-sphere tactics deck that could quest at 9 and once all the attachments are in place fight like beasts!

I like Theoden a lot too, and like you I've had trouble making a reliable deck with him in it.  However, I did choose him when going to the Fellowship Event, and beat the Fog on the Barrow-downs quest in a 2-player game.  Theoden-Eomer-Merry for a nice thematic deck, along with a Gandalf-Aragorn(Lo)-Glorfindel(Sp) deck that my partner had.

I find him useful when I don't need large questing all the time, but need an occasional push (combined with one or two 2+ willpower Tactics heroes). He's a good defender and attacker the rest of the time. I honestly just love using him and never really see him a hindrance.
