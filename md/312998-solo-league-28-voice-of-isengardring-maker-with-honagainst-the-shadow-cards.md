## 1 [Alonewolf87 on December 1, 2020](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/312998-solo-league-28-voice-of-isengardring-maker-with-honagainst-the-shadow-cards/?do=findComment&comment=4023111)

Welcome to the LOTR Solo League. This month we'll be playing three quests from The Voice of Isengard and The Ringmaker. The quests are:

1) To Catch an Orc
2) The Dunland Trap
3) Celebrimbor's Secret

Here are the rules:

1) Each player will construct a 50+ card deck, then use that exact deck against all three quests. You may use that deck freely against any quests (include the three quests in the league) prior to the run for testing purposes, but you may not use any trial runs for your official results.

2) At least one of the heroes must be from a box with those quests. This means that you must have at least one of Tactics Eomer, Grima, Celeborn and Galadriel

3) Your score against each quest will be how much help you need to defeat it, based on the Grace of the Valar variant invented by Seastan. It works like this:

For each token you have, you can choose to draw a card or give a hero a resource. This happens one at a time, so if I use my first token to draw a card, I see the card before I decide whether to use my second token for a card or a resource. This can be done *anytime* during setup.

The original variant starts at zero tokens and gains two tokens if you lose quickly (first five turns) and one if you do not -- however, for the purposes of this league I will allow you to start a quest at any number of tokens, and adjust by as many as you want. The only rules for adding/reducing tokens are these:

Rule 1) If you lose a quest with X tokens, you cannot play that quest again with X or less tokens.
Rule 2) If you defeat a quest with Y tokens, you cannot play that quest again with Y or more tokens.

So for example, if I start with six tokens against Into the Pit and defeat it, I can play it again with 0-5 tokens. If I then try with three tokens and lose, I can play it again with 4 or 5 tokens. If I try with four and lose, I can play it again with 5 tokens. If I win, my final score for that quest is 5, and if I lose my final score for the quest is 6. (Alternatively, I could've decided that 6 was a good enough score the first time I played it, and just have my final score be 6 without playing again.)

Remember that tokens do not carry over between quests. When playing Foundations of Stone it does not matter how many tokens I needed to defeat Road to Rivendell.

4) You are not required to publish your deck, but providing a ringsdb link is encouraged (otherwise I may need to ask you for your decklist at the end of the month if required for a tiebreaker). You are required to reveal which Heroes you used, and how many cards in your deck came from outside The Lost Realm/Angmar Awakened, SoH/Haradrim and a single core. Do not include outside heroes in this count, only cards in the deck itself.

Note: Contracts (from the most recent cycle) are not part of the deck and should not be counted. A Loot Deck (from the Burglar's turn contract) is also not part of the deck and should not be counted. The One Ring or the Messenger of the King ally/hero should also not be counted *unless* your deck uses those cards to reach 50 -- the Master card fetched by the One Ring should be counted. You may follow contract/One Ring setup instructions at the same as hero setup, ignoring Caleb's ruling.

5) Tiebreakers have frequently mattered in this league. Here are the tiebreakers, in order:
---
1st) The number of outside cards (i.e. not from The Voice of Isengard/The Ring-Maker, HoN/Against the Shadow or a single core) used in the deck. Do not count outside heroes in this count, only cards in the deck. Less cards is better.

2nd) The number of heroes specifically from The Voice of Isengard/The Ring-Maker and HoN/Against the Shadow. More is better.

3rd) The number of heroes used from this list: Tactics Eomer, Grima, Celeborn and Galadriel. More is better.

4th) The number of cards in the deck outside The Voice of Isengard/The Ring-Maker and HoN/Against the Shadow. Less is better, and core cards are considered "outside" for this tiebreaker.

5th) The number of cards outside The Voice of Isengard, The Dunland Trap and Celebrimbor's Secret. Less is better, and core cards are considered "outside" for this tiebreaker.

6th) Performance in November's Solo League (if you didn't play or finish Novemberr's League, a median performance will be assumed). Whoever did worst wins this tiebreaker.
---

6) 1st place gets to choose the cycle for February's league, 2nd place gets to choose a quest from that cycle, and 3rd place gets to choose a quest *not* to be used from that cycle. In an effort to expand the diversity of decks used, the last place player will choose an additional cycle that may be used for deckbuilding in February's league.

7) Weekly deadlines will at 11:59pm Eastern on the 14th, 21st, and 28th. Only the final deadline really matters for scoring and cannot be extended -- the first two deadlines are only to be included in intermediate standings.

To Catch an Orc: December 14th
The Dunland Trap: December 21st
Celebrimbor's Secret: December 28th

8 ) I've created a google spreadsheet for results here:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zCBGP_y9pGYW6YHsfSoQM749xb1CFFdvlO3cNn_NcdM/edit#gid=0 [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zCBGP_y9pGYW6YHsfSoQM749xb1CFFdvlO3cNn_NcdM/edit#gid=0]

To join the league, merely add your name and information about your deck to the spreadsheet, then enter your results as you have them. Please give a link to your deck if you built or published it on ringsdb, but it is not required.

If you wish you may run additional decks against the quests and record your results, but only the first entry will be considered for the competition itself.

I had my worries about how the mechanics of To Catch An Orc might broke the combo of my Silvan Deck but luckily I had one copy of Host of Galadhrim in my hand at the start of the game, and another Host of Galahdrim with 2 copies of Galadhrim Weaver in what was left of my deck. My thinned down deck thus worked on my favor and soon the combo was firing off and I steamrolled the quest even though it took quite some time to find Mugash. 0 Valar Tokens

The Dunland Trap was another quest that worried me due to its particular mechanics. I rushed through Stage 1 to get ahead with my allies army's destruction so that I could rebuilt it again. This ended up having me hover over 45 Threat for a long time due to having to use again all the Doomed events but I was still able to score a first attempt victory, with Henamarth Riversong being a clear MVP. 0 Valar Tokens again.

Celebrimbor's Secret was a real breeze, I had only played it as a 4 players Fellowship before and I was expecting more problems, but since The Orc's Search basically never triggered and the only Scour Effect I saw was the mandatory one from passing from Stage 1 to Stage 2 it was all super easy, despite the fact that my deck performed slightly worse than usual.

I must say this Silvan combo deck is really something, I would not use it in a Fellowship (both for the Doomed and for the extremely long Planning Phases), but against lots of solo quests it really rocks.

Here is the usual Playthrough

The orc has been caught. Took a while to find the sneaky git, because he was hiding very deep inside the set-aside cards, but once the deck was set up with some allies and attachments, there wasn't really anything happening from the encounter deck, that caused me any trouble.

Well I decided to challenge myself this month with using just the restricted card pool (aside from the hero choices and MOTK contract that let me start with Anborn). But opening round I had the choice to play ranger spikes or treebeard and what were the odds that I would be overwhelmed with enemies round 1? So I went with Treebeard using Grima’s cost reduction and during the questing phase drew an enemy that revealed another card and summoned a second enemy and the shadow effect killed a hero. Pretty quick game loss after that. 
 

Tried again with 2 tokens and got the traps really flowing this time. Though it was really hard to quest when so many of my allies ended up in my out of play 20 cards and getting discarded. In the end I was questing with everyone and constantly recycling traps with Anborn. I managed to just scrape out a victory.

 

Tokens used: 2

The Dunland Trap required 2 Tokens for me. The first attempt was over in round 1, when I had three enemies engaged with my heroes, already. The second one took longer, but the start was not great either, and I was always behind, until it became too much. The third game, finally, worked fairly well, and even though I lost a couple allies and attachments to the trap (no real point to hold on to cards, when your hand gets discarded constantly), I was pretty well-prepared for the rest of the scenario, and quickly found a new healer, which was very good, as there was quite a lot of damage incoming. Not enough to kill my heroes, though, thanks to the healer and a number of resources spent to use him more than once per round.

The Dunland Trap was a an edge-of—the-seat adventure which could have gone anyway at anytime. This was the quest I had tried to build around foolishly thinking To Catch an Orc would be easier. But my opening strategy worked here and I was able to use a Forest Snare to great advantage. Choosing the Boar Clan Stalkers whenever I got to pick a Dunland enemy and then disabling them with a snare. I the set up several traps in the staging area and when I progressed to the Ambush chose to keep Treebeard with a few resources on him as my only ally. The final round I was holding off against two Boar Clan Stalkers and Chief Turcot himself. Trapping one stalker I was able to use Treebeard to fend off against the other as my cheap rangers and ents boldly sacrificed themselves to protect the counsellor Grima safe from Turch’s attacks. Managed to win first try with no tokens required.

Celebrimbo’s Secret was the smoothest of the three and the Trap deck really shone here. From round one I was able to keep a steady combo of Poisoned Stakes and Ranger Spikes going and recycling to keep pretty much all Orcs stuck in the staging area hemorrhaging out and poisoned. The one that snuck through I defended with a well-funded TreeBeard and then subsequently Forest Snared and forgot about. Threat was the only thing that got a bit dicey but with Gandalf’s arrival x2 I was able to stay in the quest. That’s how I won the final round with a group attack from rangers and Ents crushing the poor Belach as all his forces watched in immobilized. It was a lot of fun bringing Traps again as I have tried time and again to make them work but MOTK Anborn is really the key that was missing for them. Having his awesome ability round one is fantastic especially when combined with Damrod’s card draw/cost reduction. There is always a trap being deployed.

total for the three quests: 2 tokens.

Celebrimbor's Secret wasn't much of a problem. The start was a little rough, since I engaged one enemy too many (didn't realize, that I didn't have to as my Threat was below 40 still), which really slowed down my counterattacks. But once Glorfindel showed up, and got a Warrior Sword, he just dispatched everything with ease. Should have put more Warrior Swords in, instead of the other weapons, since it also works on characters not just heroes (which I only realized during that game; I didn't really take much time building that deck), it doesn't even require Sword-thain and I could play a second copy on Gandalf. Anyways, that was that.

The notice of the closure of the forums here on this website is quite the sad news, but I hope we will be able to carry on with these monthly leagues elsewhere...

Dale usually posted them on Board Game Geek LOTR LCG forum, so I’ll switch over to that if you guys are good with that? I’m Christian_Medic on there.

I am finally done with work for the year so I should able to get this in for the month.  Just have to see how my Silvan deck does against these quests as I used Rohan/Gondor two handed in my original playthrough of the cycle.  And yeah, I originally found this league through the BGG forum so I am good with that.  Granted I seem to only get in the league every other month so I'll let you regulars hash it out.  If we do continue doing the BGG forums I am weaponx1017 over there.
