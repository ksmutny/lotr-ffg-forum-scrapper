I am a new player, and i didnd understand some parts of the rules!

1) After the combat fase is over, if the enemy is alive he still will be  engaged with that player in the next round?

2)If yes, the engaged enemy conts its Threat Strength to the quest?

3)Can i fully explore a location without even traveling to it with the "Snowbourn Scout" Ability?   ( it says: response After Snowbourn scout enter play. choose a location. place 1 progress token on that location )
