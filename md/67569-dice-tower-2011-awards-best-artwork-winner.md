Lord of the Rings LCG has won the Dice Tower 2011 award for best artwork!

Congratulations to Zoe Robinson, the designers and especially all the artists that have made this the most beautiful and thematic game out there! The art is SO important and allows us to enter Tolkien's world in a really immersive way when we play this game.

You can listen to a nice interview with Zoe Robinson here:

Hard to imagine another game beating out LotR. As already noted, nearly all of the artwork has been spectacular. Certainly doesn't hurt that it's progressively becoming "The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game (illustrated by Magali Villeneuve)." happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]
