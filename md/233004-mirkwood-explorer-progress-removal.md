Does Mirkwood Explorer lose progress placed on him as a result of a card like Fallen Stones?  I assume yes from a strict perspective, but if we go by designer's intent, it is possible they only intended for it to remove progress from quest cards/locations.

 

Response: After Mirkwood Explorer quests successfully, place 1 progress on it.

 

When Revealed: The first player (choose 1): removes all progress tokens from play, or reveals 2 cards from the encounter deck and adds them to the staging area.

Looks like you would have to remove his progress tokens.

I received confirmation.

 

> Fallen Stones does not specify that the progress tokens should only be removed from quest cards or locations, so any progress on Mirkwood Explorer would also be lost if you choose to resolve that effect.

I decided that while I agree with the others here that to know for certain I would need to ask the developers.  For all we know the intent could be that it doesn't work on progress on player cards like Mirkwood Explorer and it was previously moot so they did not think to exclude it from the effect.

I'm just thinking: if you want to ask the developers regardless of the community response, you could just ask the developers and then post the response (as you've done before), without the community question.  But don't caress our egos and make us think you love us, cmabrs002, only to take our consensus and say Behold! After All You Are Only Mere Mortals.  The Gods Have Spoken.

Well, one reason to ask is to check if someone's already had a ruling on this or on an equivalent situation.

 

Now, you might think that this question is sufficiently clear-cut that there's no need to get an official ruling on it, but it's worth noting that Caleb does occasionally rule that old cards ought to say soemthing a bit different from what they do, to take into account a new mechanic that wasn't present when the card was written.

I think it was more that I posted it before I sent in my questions to the developers.  When I went to send my email about the Goblin Patrol question, I went ahead and just emailed about everything else I was currently wondering. 

 

In hindsight, I should have just asked this one to the developers directly, because the only thing making me think it might not apply to Mirkwood Explorer was developer's intent which as far as I know, none of us know since, as you say, we are mere mortals.

It was a test of our faith. The community answered, and our answer was in accordance with the Will of Caleb, and--Behold!--exactly one week later, were we not blessed with a preview of the fourth Haradrim AP?
