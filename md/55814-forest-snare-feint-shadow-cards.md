I received a reply from Nate French regarding whether shadow cards are resolved that are dealt to enemies that are snared or feinted, Here is his response for anyone who might be interested:

"Shadow cards do not resolve if the enemy does not attack, and they are discarded with other shadow cards at the end of the combat phase.

I was wrong about this one too :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

If no one would be wrong, who would be right then?

if no-one was wrong and we all had different interpretations and opinions it would be very confusing. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Thanks for posting this.

I just purchased the game today (and have already played it 3 times), and I ran into this question tonight.

Okay, time to go try out another sphere... gran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif]

It was clear but it good to have an official answer in any case. Thanks
