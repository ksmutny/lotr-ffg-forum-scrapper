Hi all

Recently, this much sought after pack, and the others in the cycle were all in the Upcoming section as reprints, however now they are gone. Any thoughts on why this is?

Perhaps they have actually been reprinted and we await them on shelves, or is that too hopeful...

I would imagine it has to do with the dock worker slow down on the west coast. Pretty much everything coming from Asia is on massive delay now as the freight ships are piling up in the harbors. There have been disagreements between the shipping companies and the workers unions for awhile now.

Could be, thanks. Also I didn't think to check the live product pages, and there they all are.
