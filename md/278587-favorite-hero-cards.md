The title is pretty self-explanatory, and I’d be surprised if this hasn’t been a topic before, but I’m curious.

My favorite over-all so far is Tactics Eomer, largely as he’s just one of my favorite LotR characters :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Of the others I own, I’m most looking forward to trying out Haldir, Lore Faramir, and Idraen more.

I like Damrod because he enables traps in a big way. 

Been a fan of Gimli since the beginning -- his star has faded not because he's less good than other heroes (he's still really good), but because there are flashier and newer effects that have eclipsed him.

Arwen is one of the best heroes in the game, with excellent art.

And honorable mentions to Tactics Theoden, Galadriel, Lore Faramir, Beorn, Tactics Merry, Galdor, Halabard for some odd reason, and lastly Leadership Gimli, who I would like to use more than I actually have.

I just realized that posting this was me subconsciously trying to figure out which heroes I should prioritize buying next ?

This is the place where I would say Saruman... if game had one! Grima.

## 5 [monkeyrama on July 1, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/278587-favorite-hero-cards/?do=findComment&comment=3391031)

Tactics Legolas has a special place in my heart, and recently I've really like Elfhelm and Spirit Beregond. Oh, and Spirit Merry!

These are the ones that sprang to mind. Both Eomers are fun to use, and Tactics Eowyn is epic.

I don't really know. I rather play and think about efficient heroes than heroes I like. It would potentially be hobbit heroes Tom Cotton, LoPippin, SpiMerry, Frodo, Folco and Sam

Top Spot has to be Treebeard for me. First hero I really wanted to build a Deck around. Spend a few hours putting in everycard I might use and then cutting/sideboarding it down to 50. Played a few quests; modified it. Finally made versions for multiple Core Sets and Multiplayer (as the Deck was intended to be for solo play). 

It was such a great feeling passing the final „test“ of Carn Dum. 

So yeah Treebeard No. 1! :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Honorable mentions go to: Elrond, Gandalf, Merry (T), Arwen and Denethor (L)

Edit: Looks like I messed up the format of some Parts and have no clue how to fix it on mobile :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

My favorite hero is Dori.  Not because he's the most powerful (swapping him out for Bergerond would make most of my Dori fellowships better), but because he was roundly maligned when he came out and yet I've found him flexible and useful.

My favorite "filler" heroes (need a useful hero of sphere X -- grab this):

Theodred -- lousy quester, but that flexible resource grant makes him useful practically everywhere.  Combine with Heir of Mardil for action advantage.

Damrod -- because what deck wouldn't benefit from some cheap traps and card draw?

SpMerry -- love repeatable threat reduction for a tiny threat cost.  Hobbit Pony makes him shine.

Hirgon -- quest successfully, play Honour Guard for 1 -- I like it.  Pity Red Arrow is one per deck.

On a more serious note with so many heroes it's really tough, considering how totally different they can be, on their own, as lynch pins for deck archetypes, or just in very deck because they are so useful (like arwen)

## 14 [Will Anderson on July 2, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/278587-favorite-hero-cards/?do=findComment&comment=3391536)

I'll not interpret favourite to mean 'most used' (which for me would probably mean the two Eowyns, the two Beregonds, Arwen, Sam, Lore Pippin and Tactics Aragorn), but as most fun. I think heroes that enable a specific deck style particularly well, like Folco for stealth or Damrod for traps, are really enjoyable to play with, and I'm looking forward to Haldan being in that vein. Otherwise, my favourite heroes do something thematically satisfying and also mechanically unique; Lore Denethor, Beorn, Lore Aragorn, etc.

## 15 [Authraw on July 2, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/278587-favorite-hero-cards/?do=findComment&comment=3391552)

I really like Amarthiúl. Ask me again tomorrow and I'll probably give you a different answer, but tonight it's him.

Dúnedain is probably my favourite archetype, and I rarely make a Dúnedain deck without him, so that's why he's my pick.

Truth! Grima is my second favorite and tactics Boromir my favourite. And we still play him the old correct way not the new errated one. Mostly because to run the two heroes together is madness haha

By all means feel free to play without the errata, but please don't call it the correct way. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

I have no right to tell someone how to play a card, and I hope it didn't sound like I was trying to. I was simply stating that the correct way (I should clarify. By "correct," I simply mean the way that the rules say) to play cards is with errata observed. I believe in absolute truth.

That said, I'm not at all judging you, @GILLIES291 [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/314461-gillies291/] and @Rouxxor [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/308704-rouxxor/]if you want to play without the errata. I sometimes do that myself. I'm just making sure the rules of the game are stated and players are aware of them (of course, you probably know the rules better than me, Rouxxor). Whether you follow them or not is completely up to you, if that makes sense.

The bottom line is this (and what I probably should have said in the first place): There is only one way to legally play cards: according to the rules of the game. Obviously, you are not breaking a law to play otherwise, and it is completely up to you whether you want to follow that or ignore them sometimes. It is, after all, a co-op game; so if it makes the game more fun for you; by all means feel free to house-rule.

All due respect and to you, Gillies. And to you as well, Rouxxor. I hope this argument doesn't lead to a fight between the two of us, because I truly do respect you and your opinions; and enjoy our conversations.

No offense taken, just different points of view. I will concede I call it the old true way of the men of Gondor. I mean he did have to single-handeldy take Osgiliath so you know he was refreshing more than once a phase hahaha

## 22 [Zura on September 10, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/278587-favorite-hero-cards/?do=findComment&comment=3465018)

It's Elrond for me. I know it's basic, but elrond archetype really is incredible. Just hoping he doesn't get erratad to oblivion...

There was no offense. My point was quite neutral since it also mean that your way was both the correct way ^^.

I'm not really afraid of people who are aware of the errata but who think it is not official. I never find anyone in this case. I found many people who don't know the errata (and at this point we forget to explain them what have change: in the latest FAQ Boromir can only ready once per phase) and few who express the need to explain to the others what they should play. I personally have a favorite way to play the card (almost every time the official one) but no concern about how people must play it.

I'm glad there is no misunderstanding, I like our conversations too :).

I don't have a lot of cards or expansions or adventure packs. At most I have adventure packs up to Shadow and Flame with some packs missing in between. With my limited card pool, my favorite hero is Spirit Glorfindel, for a couple of different and weird reasons.

- First is because of the really good artwork on that card. I'm tempted to say the artwork rivals that of the really good MTG cards.

- Second, Spirit Glorfindel is pretty straightforward to use. Slap on Light of Valinor on him and you can quest and attack every round. Simple. I like simple. He also starts out with very low threat to give you time to find Light of Valinor in the early rounds.

- Third reason is because he was shunned in the movie trilogy. Like seriously, Glorfindel was a bad-*** in the books, but you wouldn't know if you only watched the movies. If my memory serves me right, aside from Gandalf, Glorfindel is the only other character/hero I know, that has taken on and defeated a Balrog. And he's not even an Istari, just an Elf.

- Fourth reason is he allows me to build thematic decks and not worry about losing questing power because I don't have Spirit Eowyn in my deck.

My second favorite hero is Lore Aragorn.

Loads of Balrogs die in the fall of Gondolin. Ecthelion kills the biggest, baddest Balrog about twenty minutes before Glorfindel kills his (both die doing it, which is a bit repetitive tbh).

Ooh I never even knew about this Ecthelion character until you mentioned it. He seems to be an even bigger hero than Glorfindel, except looks like he wasn't reincarnated like Glorfindel and Gandalf were. Glorfindel was mentioned in the first LOTR book, but I don't remember reading about Ecthelion, but in my defense, it has been a decade since I last read the books. So the three of them died battling Balrogs, I wonder why that is.

It would be cool if there were Ecthelion hero/ally cards, but as it is, the only Ecthelion card I could find is a treachery card. They probably couldn't make him a hero/ally anyway, considering he probably died in the First Age.

## 29 [dalestephenson on September 10, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/278587-favorite-hero-cards/?do=findComment&comment=3465566)

Ecthelion may well have been reincarnated, but that would have been in Valinor, where Mandos receives elvish souls for future reincarnation.  Glorfindel's an exceptional case, possibly unique, in that after being reincarnated in Valinor he was sent back to Middle Earth (either second or third age; Tolkien changes his mind on these sort of things quite frequently).

## 30 [Wandalf the Gizzard on September 11, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/278587-favorite-hero-cards/?do=findComment&comment=3465683)

@Finch204 [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/320911-finch204/] You probably don't remember Ecthelion because he was in the Silmarillion, not LotR.

Hurin Thalion, son of Galdor of the House of Hador (a mortal man, albeit an Edain) single-handedly kills a multitude of Balrogs in the Nirnaeth Arnoediad.

I'm not sure that's correct. I recall that Hurin slays dozens of orcs and trolls -- to the extent that he's eventually trapped beneath their bodies -- while covering Turgon's retreat, but not any actual Balrogs.

Tolkien's idea of what a Balrog actually was changed between drafts of his various stories, so the defence of Gondolin from an army of them riding armoured wurms isn't necessarily as great a feat as Gandalf breaking a little bridge and falling off.

Ack. That's right. My brain was referring to Trolls as Balrogs for some reason. Nevermind.

You're right. I have not read the Silmarillion, but I plan to do so later this year. I've been putting off reading it because it is supposedly a tough read. I want to pick up the new book Fall of Gondolin first.

## 35 [Edheliad on September 12, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/278587-favorite-hero-cards/?do=findComment&comment=3467294)

The best version of The Fall of Gondolin was in The Book of Lost Tales Part Two. I don't know how the new book differs from that, though.

Not at all tough, IMHO. I breezed through it, but then again I do enjoy heavier books.

Read it, will clear a lot of things before reading fall of Gondolin ...

 

Also after reading about Fingolfin, all this Gandalf, Glorfindel etc debate will have no meaning ?

 

BTW, my best ones are Glorfindel (Sp), Aragorn (Lo), Galadriel, Treebeard, but there are lots of others I also like a lot 

## 38 [JusticeLizard on September 20, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/278587-favorite-hero-cards/?do=findComment&comment=3477625)

My favorite Heroes are the ones whose powers are thematic.  Tactics Eowyn, Frodo, Galadriel (of course), and (you may think I'm crazy) Fatty Bolger.
