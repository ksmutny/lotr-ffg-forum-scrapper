I started a thread asking if anyone had a link to a UK  branch. It was deleted. I added products ( lotrtlcg ) to my basket, this too was  deleted. Why has this happened?

i'm going to be completely honest and say that i don't really know what you're asking.

 

you're looking for a place to order the game in the UK?

you ordered from a place, but the order didn't work?

No, im talking about a thread i started yesterday,  asking for help and that thread was deleted. I added products to my basket ( on this site ) and now the basket is empty. so my main question to the Mods is: why has this happened and why did they accept this thread and not my original? 

 

So my original question is: does anyone have a link to a UK FFG site so i can purchase from EU? thats my original question.

Boardgameprices.co.uk is a good site to use to track down lotr packs in the uk

the mods have no control over this.  it could be a connection error (either on your end or the site's)

it also could account for the deleted thread (ie: that it failed to post, not that the mods deleted it)

 

https://www.bookdepository.com [https://www.bookdepository.com] has a relatively small selection, but the prices are p low (and free shipping internationally; i believe they're based in UK, so shipping times shouldn't be too long)

i would also suggest trying your order on the FFG site again if that's more convenient than the other suggested options

I've been buying a whole bunch of LOTR LCG stuff from Magic Madhouse - Link [https://www.magicmadhouse.co.uk/tabletop-games-c1302/living-card-games-c1669/lord-of-the-rings-t2966].  A few days ago they had a few copies of Conflict at Carrock and I hadn't seen it anywhere else. If you spend over £20 you get free delivery and stuff always turns up in a couple of days. 

 

Hope that helps!
