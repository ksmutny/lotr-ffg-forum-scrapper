Evidently, from reading posts on this forum, there are a few players out there, who by virtue of their 3+ Core Sets, their utter lack of other activities to occupy them besides deck building, or just natural all-round brilliance have entirely mastered the game, and are thoroughly bored by the lack of challenge offered.

Could they please post their complaints about how far beneath their capabilities the game is, and how generally moronic the rest of us must be if we ever do anything so shocking as lose a quest, or seek advice/suggestions on tackling a particular problem?

If they do this, then maybe the mere mortals amongst us might be able to continue to use this forum without finding EVERY OTHER THREAD full of these complaints

I think Durin means players like me cose i always complain about difficult of the game. But for now with KD release is fine! Game is much more harder and much more interesting. I play only solo for now and i so happy with KD quests! They are relaly cool! Good job of designers! I will try KD quests soon with my friend in co-op game. Then will see how it goes on 2 player game. But dont forget i never use powerful card like Trackers or Beravur or Will of the west......

Wow, just got RtM and thought: "Hey, Jimmy is right - I play 2 rounds, my heroes heartly welcome - fill in name of one of the nine killer cards  - and the game is over before it has started. Makes deckbuilding a lot easier when you're going to loose anyway and also you can play tons of game in a short time span."

 

Seriously, what did the designers have in their minds when they created RtM? The multiplayer mode is amazing, but for a single player it's simply annoying. Couldn't they made some slight changes, like rising your threat by only 2 instead of 3, rising the players total threat to 60 or editing 3B's text so that I'm able to play cards in the crucial part of the game? Cards like, say GG or Gandalf? Heck, I wouldn't even mind if they had brainwashed one of the Attercops to fight on your side!* So many opportunities to fit this scenario in a single player mode, but they did... nothing?

 

RtM has such a challenging encounter deck, but I don't get too experience it because either I get some lucky draws and hurry through the addventure (boring) or I run out of threat and loose just when things get interesting.

 

 

* still hoping for a card that makes this possible

well, i really think solo gameplay is not the focus of this game.,.. but either way... there is a pretty good custom rule set up that iGaveHimLife made that makes return MUCH mroe fun... there is  discussion of it here [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=600394] if you wana try it out and put your 2 cents in.

i dont see anything that takes this game away from the 1-2 player on the box.......its 50/50 in my opinion....only time will tell i guess

Thanks for posting that link. I think that the suggested rules make sense, I only ask myself why the designers didn't come up with something similar so that I don't feel like I'm cheating by using custom rules. In this case btw it doesn't matter if the focus of the game lies on solo or multiplayer, when they only had to add some minor rule changes to make RtM playable (and more important: enjoyable) for solo players.
