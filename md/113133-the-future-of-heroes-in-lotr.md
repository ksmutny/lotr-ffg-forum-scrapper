I'm not so interested in predicting what heroes the designers are working on or which ones will be released next, because that's just pure speculation.  So, taking a step back, what does the future look like for heroes in this game?  Most major named characters have now been accounted for.  Which named characters do you think would be good fits?  What kind of invented heroes do you think they might go for?

 

As for me, I'm still hoping for Cirdan, Treebeard, and Radagast.  

 

I also love the idea of invented heroes, and I think maybe a couple more hobbits would be nice.

I think we need a hero version of Smaug.  He seemed like a nice guy at heart.

 

But seriously, maybe Thranduil or Grimbeorn.  I bet we get Gollum/Smeagol in one of the later saga boxes.  I could also see a Treebeard hero.

I'm waiting for more hobbits, personally. Secrecy is really appealing with them, but the Spirit hobbits seem lacking.

Yeah Thranduil is whom I'm hoping for. I was just thinking that it's interesting that these current Silvan elves are from Lórien. This might mean they're saving Mirkwood elves for another expansion...

I think there will be remade hereos:

 

-Legolas, Eowyn and Gimli will get other versions (I predict spirt, tactics and leadership)

-Arwen will be made into hero (likley lore)

-At some point Tactis version of Aaragorn is coming --> I think in the return of the king cycle

-Theoden King will have a leadership version as well

Well, all guys from my list could be thematically explained as heroes (except for, maybe, the Hand, but it's negotiable too :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]).

Not that this is needed in terms of power, but maybe they'll do a reprint of Imrahil (or other Outlands leaders) with the Outlands trait?

I'm afraid, reprinting any of current heroes with an Outlands trait threatens to "break the game".

 

If we'll ever see any more Outlands heroes, they'll be extremely weak and with some crafty text boxes to compensate for the overall outlands power.

Halbarad would be nice. Erkenbrand as well.

Right. I don't think it would be healthy at all for the game to just print an Imrahil hero that has the same stats/text as Hirluin, for instance. Also, I just noticed that you had already suggested essentially the same thing in your first post. Oops!

I just looked through all the characters that are in the Middle Earth CCG that haven't shown up in the LCG yet (to my knowledge).  I don't know who most of them are, but maybe someone else knows and thinks they would be a good hero.  Here is the list with their home site and potential trait in parenthesis:

 

Adrazar (Dol Amroth), Annalena (Edhellond), Arinmir (Edhellond), Beretar (Bree), Bergil (Minas Tirith), Cirdan (Grey Havens), Erkenbrand (Edoras), Folco Boffin (Bag End), Fram Framson (Framsburg), Galdor (Grey Havens), Galva (Shrel-Kain), Gamling the Old (Edoras), Ghan-buri-Ghan (Druadan Forest), Halbarad (Cameth Brin), Haldalam (Shrel-Kain), Ioreth (Minas Tirith), Mablung (Lond Galen), Peath (Dunnish Clan-hold), Robin Smallburrow (Bag End), Thrain, Thranduil (Thranduil's Halls / Woodland Realm), Voteli (Lossadan Camp), Vygravril (Southron Oasis), Wacho (Woodmen-town).  Also the Wizards Alatar and Pallando.  There are a bunch of allies too, but none of the allies have been made into LCG heroes so far, so I'm not going to list them.

 

3 of them are Southrons/Easterlings.  That would be interesting.

I suggested an Outlands Prince Imrahil, which in my vision would be another sphere (Lore most preferable) and has different stat and/or text box.

I second Arwen, Cirdan and Erkenbrand (though Arwen is a fantastic ally and I'd probably not drop her for a hero version). I'd also like to see new versions of Elrond, Faramir, Legolas and Eowyn.

DEFINITELY Erkenbrand and Thranduil. I'd love to see a hero version of at least Haldir, and his brothers Rumil and Orophin would be nice to see as well. Also, if they made a Bain hero (son of Bard), it would be cool to run a Bard , Bain, and Brand deck, even if it wouldn't make sense.

I believe that many of the MECCG characters you list (the ones I have quoted above - from memory so maybe wrong) are from the material invented by Iron Crown Enterprises for MECCG/MERP - so not Tolkien canon as such and therefore we won't see them in TLOTR LCG.

Yeah, I think you're right.  And Thrain, Mablung, and Galdor were before the war of the ring.  I'm pretty sure Bergil is the errand rider card because he was just a boy.  So yeah, we're left with a few lesser Hobbits (Folco and Robbin), greater Elves (Cirdan and Thranduil), Rohirrim (Erkenbrand, Gamling), a Dunedain ranger (Halbarad), a Gondorian healer (Ioreth), an obscure man (Fram), and a Druadan (Ghan-buri-Ghan).  I don't know about the last 2 or 3, but I could see all of the others appearing.

There was a ranger of Ithilien in the Two Towers called Mablung, and we even have the art for his future card. Fram son of Frumgar was also before the War of the Ring.

Hmmmmmm...

Hero version of Anborn?

Perhaps not only a hero version of Treebeard but Quickbeam and the other more famous ents?

Hero version of Erestor?

Grimbold?

Hero version of Gildor?

Hero version of Rumil and Orophin?

These are just ideas.

So what? All this thread about is speculation. All things posted here are just ideas. And it was intended as a joke, not an act of smart-asseness, so go into the corner and think about your behavior.

Double-sided hero card? Smeagol one side, Gollum the other. When you use his ability (or maybe when he exhausts, or you use The One Ring) you have to flip the card over and have Gollum hindering you for the rest of the turn, until he refreshes and flips back.

Best card game OR LOTR game ever published, definitely agree! Best art, stays pretty **** loyal to the source material and is super fun and pretty **** difficult. Nothing can beat it.

I would like to see a few I guess you could say "fringe" 3rd age heroes including Arathorn, Thror, and Thrain. I could vision Arathorn providing a stat boost for the Dunedain trait and as for Thorin's father and grandfather I would think it would be nice to have a few more dwarf heroes that can work in decks not specifically built around dwarves.

I'll also throw in some heroes whom we've already seen but with some different sphere associations

Aragorn- would like to have one of each trait eventually providing the game lasts many more years

Gimli-lore/spirit

Legolas-lore/spirit

Theoden- leadership

Elrond-leadership

Eowyn- tactics

Faramir- spirit/tactics/leadership (I just want a Faramir hero that is actually good)

Thorin- lore/tactics (I want one that can be used outside the dwarven archetype)
