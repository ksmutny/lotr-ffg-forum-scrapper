# [Necromancer&#039;s Pass ... must discard 2 cards?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54633-necromancers-pass-must-discard-2-cards/)

If the first player does not have 2 cards to discard, does that prevent the player(s) from travelling to Necromancer's Pass?  That is, does the word "must" mean that "only if the 1st player has at least two cards and discards them can the player(s) travel to Necromancer's Pass?

Yes, discard 2 cards from hand at random.  If you don't have at least 2 cards in your hand that you will discard, you won't be able to travel there.

It's a Travel Effect, right? It has "Travel" in bold letters in front. So check Rule Book p23:

"Travel Effects
Some location cards have travel effects, which are denoted by a bold “Travel:” trigger on a card. Travel effects are costs or restrictions that some or all players must pay or meet in order to travel to that location. If the players cannot fulfill the requirement of a location’s travel effect, the players cannot travel to that location."

I'd say that leaves very little room for interpretation. If you can't "pay", you cannot Travel.

 Roger that... didn't think to reread the Travel Effect rules. Now it is obvious. Thanks, Wolf!

Pay to Travel, no freeloading! Hitchhike at your own peril!

Heheheh, yeah we should just cut the part of the quote out that says: "all players must pay" and have it as a Game sub-title or slogan. gran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif]
