Any get one of these?  What is it, and is it likely to be sold by FFG later (like other Gencon labeled Stand Alone Scenario packs)?

I would count the gencon and fellowship quests among my favorites, but this concept does not excite me. I think the haradrim cycle was incredible, and I liked the idea of 2 paths in crossing of poros but in practice that quest was the one dud for me in a pile of gems.  Hopefully I will be proven wrong.....

These quests are very fun. Sometimes we just shuffle several sets together and go. The Gencon quests have always been released at a later date. The only exception is the promo (Lore Glorfindel this year) won't come in the retail version.
