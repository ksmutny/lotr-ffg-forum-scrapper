I was playing the new box set when question came up about a new keyword. We didn't have the insert with us and went to get a PDF, but it wasn't available. It seems a few APs from Angmar are not available either, nor the last saga box. When will we see these added to the website?

I guess FFG wants people to buy the actual cards.

I hope they come soon. It's crazy how long it's been since we had a rules insert uploaded to the site. I like to load these on my phone so I have the rules available when I play (granted, I need to start playing more, I'm so behind haha). Beats digging around for the insert itself.

If this is the reason, then ugh. It'd be nice to hear something about it. I don't always remember to grab rules while I'm running out the door to the store or coffee shop to play.

One of our guys is awesome.  He's put together a binder with a rulebook, all the rules inserts from each Deluxe Expansion and Adventure Pack, and a copy of the FAQ (I think).  And if I remember correctly, he also has a few copies of the Campaign tracking sheets and Scenario Scoring sheets.  I need to put one together for myself when I'm playing solo at home.
