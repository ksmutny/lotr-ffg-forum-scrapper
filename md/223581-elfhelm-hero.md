If Elfhelm hero is in play, and I put the STWB on Tactagorn granting him a Leadership icon and he has a Rohan Warhorse attached, will he get +1 att and +1 defense? SO basically does Elfhelm's ability work with songs?

His text does not say 'printed icon,' so the bonus will be granted if a hero has a sphere through a Song or other card effect.
