# [Prices of Angmar Awakend Packs roughly doubled?!?!](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/183520-prices-of-angmar-awakend-packs-roughly-doubled/)

What the f***? I noticed that the small packs of Angmar Awakend came available in my country this week. The price of these packs almost doubled, compared to old prices. (Old packs are still having the old prices.) This is ridiculous! Now they cost virtually the same as a deluxe expansion. I want old prices back! :/

</rant over>

Just checked the web store. Prices are the same as usual, so you have only your country's retailers and stuff to thank for this. No point in ranting here about it.

Yes, indeed. Basically you are right. But there is a huge increase in prices at every reseller (including Amazon) I know. So is it "the reseller" for sure? I don't think so.

Do you live in a Euro country? If so, I guess the exchange rate might be a reason...

In the UK, APs prices have been the same for at least 12 months, including at resellers such as Amazon.

In Canada the prices have increased because our dollar has diminished. It is unfortunate but happens. I'm an adult so you're more than welcome to rant about it here. For anyone not living in a sky castle, it is a frustrating turn of events when a hobby you are passionate about becomes less sustainable due to price point changes.

US board and card games have become much more expensive in Europe recently, unfortunately.

Lol. I live in Ukraine. Have you heard anything about our currency recently? It was 5:1 ratio with dollar not so long ago, now it's 22-24:1 due to the recent events. Not only the prices have skyrocketed for me, but the local retailer now refuses to preorder the game and I need to pay for them to order the pack I want in the first place, and then wait 1-2 months until it arrives. And I understand why, and I'm sane enough to comprehend that FFG has nothing to do with this. How many rant threads with curse words have you seen from me?

I don't know, I'm new here. ^__^

 

Your situation sounds frustrating as well. You are welcome to rant - I don't feel any malice towards people expressing frustration.

I don't think these forums are the right place to express this kind of frustration. There is enough negativity as it is.

Yes, the Euro is my currency. Thought about exchange rate, too. But then I wonder why the old packs still cost the same (more or less - they increased but only a little). Also, I thought about general inflation. But that would alter the prices listed on ffg.com, too. Anyway, both effects summed up could not compensate the doubling I see here and there. It might have something to do with the new packaging???

A reason that the old packs might not have increased in price is that your local supplier purchased them before the U.S. Dollar got so strong. The new packs cost the supplier more, since your currency has weakened, and that price increase is passed on to the customer.

I purchased Khazad Dum and the Dwarroldelf APs today in anticipation of price increases here in Australia. A few years back our currency was 1:1 with the US dollar, but it's on a downward slide and tipped to fall to 60 cents by the end of the year.

One of the largest game stores here has as of recently increased the expansion price from about €24 to €30 and AP price from €12 to €15. It hasn't happened in all local stores, though.
