I know this has been brought up before,  but the threads I've read didn't address my question specifically so, here goes.

 

Some locations are immune to player card effects.  But Legolas' ability does not put progress on the location specifically, it puts it on the quest which is then automatically transferred to the location.  So, does Legolas' ability indirectly put progress tokens on an active location that is immune to player card effects (by placing them on the Quest card and then having them transferred, much the same way as questing with WIllpower places progress on the Quest and then they are transferred to the Active Location) ?

About Rivendell bow, assuming it is on Legolas, he gains +1 attack when making a ranged attack.   Can I declare any attack "ranged"  or *must* a ranged attack be an attack against an enemy engaged with another player.   Some enemies such as Goblin Archer can be attacked while in the staging area with a character that has ranged,  does this count as a "ranged attack"?   What about Hands Upon the Bow?   Does that count as a ranged attack for the purposes of Rivendell bow?

First question is already in the FAQ :

> Q: If there is an active location with the text "Immune
> to player card effects" when Legolas participates in an
> attack that destroys an enemy, do I place 2 progress on
> the active location or the quest?
> A: No. When Legolas' ability would put progress on
> the current quest, if there is an active location, it puts
> progress on that location instead. If that location is
> immune to player card effects, it ignores Legolas'
> ability. Therefore, no progress would be placed on the
> active location or the current quest.

Second one, same

> Q: What counts as a “ranged” attack?
> A: A ranged attack is an attack made by a character
> with the ranged keyword against an enemy engaged
> with another player.

So, attacking in the staging area or hands uppon the bow are not.
