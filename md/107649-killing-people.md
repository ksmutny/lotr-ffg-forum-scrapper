if I kill a guy with a defensive gondorian spearman does that guy still make his attack or does he die before he gets a chance?

 

also if thailin quests and a guy with 1 hp and a when revealed effect comes out the guy dies immediately but does the when revealed effect still happen?

If Gondorian spearmans effect kills the enemy (it only has 1 hp left) then it is indeed killed before it makes it's attack. Gondorian spearman becomes exhausted and can't block a second time however!

If Thalin kills an enemy with his ability as it is revealed from the encounter deck it is discarded immediately and it's when revealed effects do not trigger.

Yes he dies.. it is worth nothing that everything in this game works like that. For example if you defend and are removed for any reason (say a shadow card or something) then you are no longer defending.
