Hello everyone.

My nam is Dan and I'm a software developer.

Would anyone be interested in an unofficial free companion app for Andriod so you don't have to use any tokens, you can track damage and resources on heros, damage on enemies and progress on locations and the main quest. Maybe a next turn button that adds resources and threat and the turn counter automatically so you never forget and have to back track.

I wouldn't be able to put any of Fantasy Flights fantastic art work in there but my brother is a pretty sweet fantasy artist.

If enough people like the idea I could crack one out in a week.

Thanks Dan.

Brill, I made one today.

 

I'll see if I can put it on the store tonight for free.

I'd kill for a nice looking four-player threat tracker/turn counter.

I have uploaded the app I cracked out into the Google Play Store under:

 

Rings LCG Companion App

 

Any suggestions to make it better please don't hesitate to let me know, its a work in progress ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

Hey Flrbb, really sorry I posted it up to the store last night and got a email this morning saying it has copy right infringements!! whoops

 

I'm going to try and fix what I think they are worried about and post again. 

 

Is 'tLotR' a copyrighted word??

 

Sorry again Flrbb.

Be sure to post again once it gets posted! I'd definitely try it out.

The App is up on the Google Play Store. It is called Rings LCG Companion Free. 

 

Let me know what you think, if it could be better in anyway. I wanted all interactions to be on the same screen so you don't have to cycle tabs to get to everything and you can check everything from a glance. This does mean that the buttons are small. Let me know if you think it need s a redesign. 

 

Thanks guys.

Did the Google Play Store take it down again? All I found was a threat dial.
