# [Two questions about Solo play and Hero selection in multiplayer](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57049-two-questions-about-solo-play-and-hero-selection-in-multiplayer/)

For people who have a lot of experience playing solo. or simply know the game better than I do, a question: are any of the ten quests so far impossible to do solo? Are there any that I should steer clear of?

Also I'd like to know how you or your group resolve matters if you are playing 2+ players and more than one person wants to play the same hero(es). Is there a universally accepted method of choosing who gets what, or do you just play it by ear?

Thanks and Take Care,
Nathan

None of the quests are impossible for a solo player. However, a few are exceedingly difficult for most solo decks. Escape from Dol Guldur forces you to play much of the game without one of your heroes, and Return to Mirkwood will make you raise your threat by a minimum of 4 each round. Those two are probably the most brutal from a solo standpoint, but A Journey to Rhosgobel can also be challenging due to the fact that it requires you to find specific cards in the encounter deck (which becomes more difficult when you are only revealing one card per quest phase). The Massing at Osgiliath is also very tough, but it's brutal no matter how many players you have.

Again, all of these quests can be conquered by a solo deck. Just don't be surprised if you lose far more frequently than you win.

With regard to contested hero selection, there's not really a standard method. When I play with a friend, we usually take turns stating our respective cases. Sometimes this will lead to a successful resolution, but more often than not we simply rely on a coin flip or a die roll.

None of these are impossible solo, though some are so hard to win solo that you would might win 1 out of 15 tries with quests like (Dol Guldur, and Osgiliath).  And this is due to the luck of drawing the right cards from the encounter deck.

For hero selection, we play using my cards and my four decks, so I just hand the decks to my friend and he picks one based on the heroes (generally) and I pick one of the three still available depending on what he picked, the quest we're playing and mood.
