Everyone likes Galadriel. Maybe except for lore Aragorn

Though Grima abandoning his pursuit of Eowyn is kinda sad - she rejected him anyways, so whe am I to blame him? Galadriel is as gorgeous as Eowyn, if not more gorgeous.

Yea... but isn't Galadriel married? Creeper.

Well, that's stone to Galadriel's garden. Keeping an affair on the side while being married...

He's only a mortal anyway.  Hardly counts.

Or Galadriel x Glorfindel untll Light of Valinor.

 

But its funny, is Galadriel only hero on whom Light of Valinor is completely useless?

Doesn't work on a lot of heroes. (But I think you meant elven.)

I also tried these two (together with Mirlonde) and it's working pretty well against the Dunland Trap. When i have the time I'm gonna lay more focus on the doomed keyword in this deck. Right now it's kinda half-assed into that direction.
