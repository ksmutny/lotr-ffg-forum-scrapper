While you're waiting for the expansion pack to arrive, check out this great 35 minute fan-made prequel film.  Not much of a plot, but it really captures the LOTR look and feel, and I think it turned out amazing considering it only cost $5,000 to make.

i have seen it before , and while it is good, no film for me, not even PJ's, could ever capture the magic of the books, just my opinion, but i guess thats why i was drawn to this game, seeing as its book based
