Does anyone have recommendations for sleeving the paper rules that come in the adventure cycles? I'm looking to protect the individual adventure rule set pages in a binder, but most sleeves that I've come across are as much protection as penny sleeves which wrinkle easy.

Thanks.

I use Avery Sheet Protectors #74171. They're heavy gauge so hold up and work for the rules booklet as well. They're decently priced on amazon.

Can't help you, I use a three hole punch directly on the rules to put them in a binder.

I laminate each sheet and insert that into cheap binders purchased from Daiso. If you are in California area, that might be a goods solution.

I would love it if each adventure pack contained a card insert instead of the paper one, like the gencon and fellowship packs do. I don't like the extraneous papers. I've thought about photoshopping something.

Throw them out when they get digitized as PDFs.

Yes, of course! Dispose of responsibly!

Yes! Please!

As part of a 'Return to ...' set that supports campaign play ( boons, burdens, etc )

Yes... Is there a link to printable versions of the quest rules cards that are included in the OCTGN packages? I tried ti find it, but without any luck...
