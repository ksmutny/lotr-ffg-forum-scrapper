Hello,

based upon recent discussion around Glorfindel, I would like to present an idea. Homebrewed cards are flying around the internet naturally but I for one would never play any - including my own (of which I only made two); but I would like to share this thought and thought behind it. If the game (or the world) does not collapse soon (which I hope it shall not) Asfaloth will see the light of day sooner or later. I just hope it is something along these lines.

Asfaloth, unique Leadership attachment cost 2

Horse.

Attach to a Noldor or Silvan character. Attached character can have no more than one Horse attached.

Attached character does not exhaust to comit to the quest.

If attached character is Glorfindel, it gains "Action: exhaust Asfaloth to choose a character. That characters gets +1 willpower or +1 attack (choose 1) until the end of the phase.

I believe the usual downfall of homebrewed cards is that they are often overpowered. Let's compare Asfaloth to Unexpected Courage, same cost in a different sphere, unique and more "restricted", lot weaker in function unless it is Glorfindel. So it is certainly not overpowered but neither it is useless for heroes like Elladan or Elrohir, and since it comes in different sphere, it gives a detour option. That Glorfindel's bonus should represent the theme of aiding others, like Frodo Baggins.

Why on earth would you make it a Leadership card, leaving Glorfindel himself unable to play it sorpresa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sorpresa.gif] ?

Wow, have you seen the new version of Aragorn? Lore. Have you seen Celebrian's Stone, Sword that was Broken, Rivendell Bow? Have you played the game much?

Now for the cool down response. I think the effect fits Leadership very much, original Aragorn, Elrohir, Imrahil, they all have ready effects "in them" plus other Leadership cards do as well; and no Lore card does. In a similar way, cards like For Gondor! or Dúnedain Mark boost attack, and Dúnedain Quest or Celebrian's Stone or Sword that was Broken boost willpower. It just all fits.

Also, most Noldor and Silvan are not Leadership.

 

I like the attachment very much, don't get me wrong, I just don't feel it synergyses (sp?) well.

Elrohir is Leadership. Thus Elladan will be likely in such a deck (or game) with Leadership as well.

But I see your concern. I just think some cards are hard to put into other sphere just because of the hero they mention. Not to say there shall be another version of Glorfindel anyway (though unlikely Leadership either).

Overall, I think it is almost hard to keep decks in one colour so to speak, the inter-sphere synergies are easy to find and encouraged by design.

I really like it!

It would be great to give Glorfindel a little bonus like this so that people would stop complaining about him. It works perfectly because that's exactly what would make Glorfindel great is getting to use both his willpower and his attack in one turn.

I also think it makes things a little more interesting when you have a card in a different sphere from the target. Just encourages creative deck-building. I'm all for it.

The only change I would make is that I would have the Glorfindel bonus give a player willpower or defense. This seems to make more thematic sense in that you can help Frodo protect himself from any Nazgul attacks! Or better yet, perhaps the ability could instead be: "Exhaust Asfaloth to cancel all damage delt to another character from one source" That would keep Frodo safe and also go along with Glorfindel's theme of healing.

Point is that Asfaloth is Glorfindel's horse, period, him not being able to play it is just baffling. That would be like making the "Sword that was Broken" a Tactics card, having to use three different heroes to pay for it and keeping it Aragorn only (yes, I know you can play it on any hero, but it's a waste of deck space if Aragorn isn't in the game). Sure, Loragorn can't pay for Sword, but Aragorn can.

The example you give is exactly why your argument does not make much sense. Sword that was Broken was obviously made for the Lore version of Aragorn, thus the Leadership icon - what use is that for the Leadership Aragorn?

It is just speculation but really with the stats given it would make no sense to be Lore, it could either go Spirit (ready effect) but much more likely Leadership (ready effect plus the boost).

Glad you like it.

Yes, the boost could go different ways. I was thinking about the steed being advantage in combat - and also willpower and attack being Glorfindel's prime. But as for Frodo, it would be better if made differently.

I really hope we see the card soon. Aragorn has already got three to his name, others surely must be coming.

Yes, Elrohir is Leadership. With the exception of one or two other Silvan/Noldor, all the other (80%) aren't. That's my point.

While I understand that inter-sphere is something encouraged, the fact that you want to have all your cards do something for you is always present when building decks to any game. 

 

In the end, you're the boss! haha
This card is yours, and if you want I can make it with your text for you.

Perhaps, but at least Aragorn in some form can play it, Glorfindel can't pay for his own **** horse??? I also dislike Celebrian's Stone and StwB being playable on any hero, just like Asfaloth, they should be "play on X only".

As for ready effects not being Lore, Erebor Record Keepers would like a word. And it's not like Spirit and Leadership are overflowing with ready effects.

Good call about Erebor Record Keeper. Shame really I did not mention it since it is probably my favourite Dwarf ally.

Leadership has a decent number of ready effects, the three heroes, Common Cause, Ever Vigilant, Lure of Moria, Grim Resolve, it is really their domain, as is willpower-attack-defense boost.

I guess such a debate as this has to go different ways, one is theme, the other is game function. Having cards that could only only be attached to one character may not be the best way for playability even though it might often make sense from the story point of view.

Such a card is meant for a hero, surely - as it might often be a waste for an ally - although I see some use for Haldir or Gildor since they are hero-like in their immense qualities. And as we now have only four Elven heroes, the brothers are half of the targets. And I think Lore-Leadership is a very good double-colour combo. Anyway, thanks for all you guys' comments, I really appreciate the debate and I appologize now if I were a bit harsh in my reaction to them, strong words is the last thing we should want to see on this board.

As for the offer, most generous one, I might not play the card officially but I would indeed like to see it if you would not mind making it. Once you have done, will you let me know?

So now they have announced a Mount card. And it is Lore. So it may well be others on this thread were right in guessing Asfaloth should be same as Glorfindel. Could it be we get both Asfaloth and the new Glorfindel? Or is this just a false hope?

And is Mount a new type, surely it cannot be, I expect it to be an attachment with Mount trait.

all good ideas to ponder on…….i am pretty sure it will be a trait attatchment, not an entire new type of card…it would be overly complex to introduce that given the limited amount of named horses in the books i mean i cant see us getting all that many horses (apart from the rohan ally creatures)….still im really looking forward to it
