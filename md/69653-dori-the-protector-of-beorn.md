So I sent FFG a note asking about Dori's response ability and if it can be used to absorb damage going to Beorn. The answer is yes:

Hi Paul,
Really glad to hear you're enjoying the Hobbit: Over Hill and Under Hill!
To answer your question: Yes, Dori can exhaust himself to take damage that would be assigned to Beorn. Dori's response targets the damage and not Beorn, so Beorn's immunity to player card effects is not a factor in this event.
Good question!
Caleb

This was mentioned as a possibility in an earlier thread, and maybe you all knew this, but now I do too! It is nice to know that there is some room for healing Beorn, in this response-type way and I think it will make him even more playable.

I can't think of any off the top of my head, but are there any other cards that have this type of response?

 Here's a case which is very similar I think:  Path of Need on Troll Cave.  Path of Need attaches to a location, but does not affect the location in any way.  Troll Cave is immune to player card effects, but Path of Need has no effect on the location.  So I've got one in my deck to slap on Troll Cave during the big battle at the end.

i dont think that works; straight from the rules supplement (emphasis mine):

""Immune to Card Effects
The location East-gate has the text, “Immune to card
effects.” This means that East-gate cannot be selected as
the target of any card effect, and it ignores the effect of any
card that would directly interact with it. The only way to
place progress tokens on it is by questing, and once Eastgate
is the active location it remains the active location
until it is fully explored (even cards like Dreadful Gap or
Strider’s Path would not be able to move it to the staging
area).""

it seems there is a very fine line then between that effect and beorns

i'm saying i believe they are the same effect  -- cards cannot be played on either, as to be "attached" you must "interact"

It looks like Bifur's action would work to. The wording on Bifur makes it sound like it would be Beorn who initiates the action to pay to Bifur, right?

Hmmm… I see what you are saying, but since Path of Need does not "directly interact" with the location - except by attaching to it granted - I think that it can be used.  I don't think that attaching in and of itself directly interacts with the card.  (Of course, I now wait to be proven wrong.)

so do you think ffg need to re-rule the other effect to agree with the beorn one?

EDIT- never mind - got it now

  Rule Question:
This question is in regards to locations that are immune to card effects (such as East Gate and Troll Cave).

Can cards such as Power in the Earth, Ancient Mathom, or Path of Need (or any other card that needs to attach to a location to trigger) attach to such locations and have their effect trigger?

Thanks so much!

Hi Matthew,
Good question. You can play attachments on locations that are immune to player card effects. If a card cannot have attachments, then it will read "Cannot have attachments." However, cards that are immune to player card effects will be immune to the abilities of attachments. So you can play Power in the Earth on the Troll Cave, but it will have no effect on that location. Card like Ancient Mathom and Path of Need work differently because they don't affect the location, so their abilities will still work.
Thanks for asking,
Caleb

So if Dori works, what about Song of Mocking?

I also asked about Fortune or Fate and Stand Together; still waiting for the answer. At the moment I am confident both works, FoF because Beorn is out of play and his text not active, and ST doesn't target Beorn directly, sort of like Dori.

Song of Mocking should not work with Beorn. Part of its effect instructs you to "choose a hero," but Beorn can't be targeted by player cards. SoM directly interacts with Beorn, but Dori doesn't. 

FoF and ST should work based on the precise criteria you cited.

I agree, SoM does target the hero… hope the other two work (and get an official greenlight soon).

 Made a deck yesterday revolving around the idea of giving off the damage from Beorn to Dori.  It works OK but not spectacularly well.  For one, Dori has low HP so u need to pump him with chain mail and 1 boots of erebor (only 1 boots may b attatched and citadel plate can only attach to a hero).  Secondly, Dori exhausts to take the damage so it only works for 1 attack limiting Beorns effectivness since he can block multiple times.  ALso used elrond to increase the healing of Dori but then the starting threat is quite high

I think it is better to let Dori die occassionaly - and recycle him with another copy or Stand and Fight. Lore and Spirit does feel good for Beorn, I think Bifur, Frodo, Beorn could work, starting threat only 26 and Dori playable on round 2. More so, you shouldn't need to use Dori's effect too many times, and only after you have run out of recycling him, you can try to boost him with the Boots and Mail - and both fit the deck nicely for either Frodo or Bifur. The best thing about it, as I tried to express in my Good Stats thread is that you shouldn't need any of these very early.

 Get some Healing Herbs on him and then strap him up with Citadel Plate using Narvi's Belt if need be.

Edit:  I guess the Herbs have to go on Ori.  Stand and Fight is a better way probably.

I might just run Elrond and a couple Wardens of Healing. Any three-damage attack is reduced to two by Beorn's defense, shunted off to Dori, and then healed away with the Warden/Elrond's response effect. Rinse and repeat.

I know this is an old thread. But I just realised that Caleb's ruling has changed in the latest FAQ 1.5:

 

Q: Can I play an attachment on an enemy or location

that is immune to player card effects.

A: No. Playing an attachment on a card is a form

of targeting, and cards with "immune to player card

effects" cannot be targeted by player cards.
