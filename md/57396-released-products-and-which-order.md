Hello all,

i've bought the core set and have been playing it for the first time yesterday with a friend. I just loved it and will certainly play a lot more the coming time. I've played the Decipher TCG for years but it's been slowly dying around here and I only rarely play with 4 friends.

What I love so far is the ability to play solo as well and that it is cooperative so my wife might like to play as well. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

But with christmas and birthdays coming up i've been wondering about the other already released sets and upcoming sets.
I live in the Netherlands and there are no shops nearby so I have to buy online. No problem, but I can't find the proper order to buy new expansions. I've made up a list of what I think is correct, but can anyone please tell me if i'm right?

This is the list I created:

Core set

1. Shadows of Mirkwood
- The Hunt for Gollum Adventure Pack
- Conflict at the Carrock
- A Journey to Rhosgobel
- The Hills of Emyn Muil
- The Dead Marshes
- Return to Mirkwood

2 The Massing at Osgiliath

3 Khazad-dûm Expansion

4 Dwarrowdelf
- The Redhorn Gate
- Road to Rivendell
- The Watcher in the Water

Thanks in advance!

The list is correct.

Just for clarification: In order to play any Mirkwood Cycle AP you need the encounter cards from the core set, samewise for Dwarrowdelf for which you will need Khazad-Dum. Massing at Osgiliath is a stand alone/print on demand pack which doesnt need any other encounter cards (it also doesnt include any player cards)
