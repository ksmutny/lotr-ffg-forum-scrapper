# [Gloin + Harbor Master](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/102875-gloin-harbor-master/)

It's just strange wording of Gloin's ability ("...add 1 resource for each...") makes me think that when Gloin suffers damage - Harbor Master gets exact amount of bonus defense as the damage Gloin suffered?

Sounds interesting yes. Why not ? 3 damage of Gloin he get +3 defence? Wow is intrigue!

I think the response is used only once when gloin receive X damage, and if he take X damage, means the response will add X ressource, all at the same time because it's one response, and so Harbor master will only get +1.

## 4 [MyNeighbourTrololo on April 1, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/102875-gloin-harbor-master/?do=findComment&comment=1034335)

The wording is different. The wording is "add 1 for each damage", meaning you will be adding separately 1 resource for each damage token recieved, creating response window for each and boosting his defense by 1 for each.

Correct.

The resources are added at the same time unless Gloin takes damage from multiple sources. Submit a rules question if you think otherwise.

This card is one instance of adding mulitple resources to a hero's resource pool.

This card is multiple instances of adding one resource to a hero's resource pool.

 

 

See the difference.

Hmmm actually im agree this is one action. Gloin get x damage but Harbor will get only 1 defence. According to FAQ and last official rule fix is right. im pretty sure. But better send letter to Caleb no?

## 8 [leptokurt on April 1, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/102875-gloin-harbor-master/?do=findComment&comment=1034377)

It's just one action, as you don't place the damage seperatly, but at once. Gloin's text is just telling you how many resources you get (one for each point of damage that was assigned (instead of tow or three)).

## 9 [MyNeighbourTrololo on April 1, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/102875-gloin-harbor-master/?do=findComment&comment=1034380)

It's not action, it's response. It's first.

 

The second, why it's worded as "add 1 for each damage" instead of "add X where X is damage".

 

Speaking of which, X was present in the core set:

First: Damage is placed at once and not one token after the other:

 

> 4. Determine combat damage. This is done by subtracting the defense strength of the defending mcharacter from the attack strength of the attacking enemy. The remaining value is the amount of damage that must immediately be dealt to the defending character, possibly destroying that character....

 

Second: Here is the text of Harbor Master:

 

>  
> 
> Response: After a card effect adds any number of resources to the resource pool of a hero you control, Harbor Master gains +1 [Defense] until the end of the round.
> 
>  
> 
>  

 

The reaction (=card effect) is triggered once and you get one resource for each damage dealt to Gloin as a result. We conclude: The card effect (=reaction) is only triggered once, hence you only get the bonus once.

 

Why the wording? Because it's shorter and better to understand. It is a bit ambigious at first glance, but once you look at the detail, it's pretty clear how it is supposed to work.

## 11 [MyNeighbourTrololo on April 1, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/102875-gloin-harbor-master/?do=findComment&comment=1034399)

Damage is placed at once, I never argued about it. I was arguing about the placement of resource tokens, so your entire post is in vain.

 

And special attention to your interpretation of "shorter and better to understand":

 

Oroginal wording:

Response: After Gloin suffers damage, add 1 resource to his resource pool for each point of damage he just suffered.

 

Alternate wording:

Response: After Gloin suffers damage, add X resources to his resource pool, where X is equal to damage suffered.

 

So using X actually makes description shorter, rendering your post pointless one more time.

Although this point has been made above, it could bear repeating: the Harbour Master reacts to a card effect, not the addition of resources.

 

What I mean is, the card states that that 'After a card effect adds any number of resources', and Gloin's text is a card effect that is adding any number of resources (well, I guess up to a limit of his hit-points). But it is still a single card effect, so it does look like the Harbour Master would only activate his response once.

 

In terms of game order, Gloin's response is completed, then the Harbour Master reacts to a single card effect. Although I feel that this is all just a pointless repetition of some posts above (as in, redundant, not futile - just being sensitive to how I worded that).

I think if Gloin dies from damage, then he wouldn't have time to trigger his response at all.

## 14 [monkeyrama on April 1, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/102875-gloin-harbor-master/?do=findComment&comment=1034409)

Well, quite. Shame it's not like Game of Thrones, in which characters are become moribund immediately on dying, and can still trigger responses (like killing everyone, including Joffrey, and then triggering his effect to get loads of power just in time to win before he's popped into the grave). 

## 15 [Distractionbeast on April 1, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/102875-gloin-harbor-master/?do=findComment&comment=1034434)

I think this one is pretty straight forward.  Gloin's effect, "add 1 resource... for each point of damage", is contained in a single Response effect.  That means the response is triggered once and all appropriate resources are added as part of that effect.  So, you have a single effect that adds resources, therefore, Harbor Master would gain +1 only.

Party pooper. No goodies for you.

Archery damage though... It is assigned one at a time. Hmm?

Harbor Master doesn't say anything about the placing of resource tokens. It says something about "a card effect that adds any number of resources". And surely Gloin's response is only activated once when he suffers damage by an attack.

 

Like I said in my post that was apparently vain. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

Yep.

 

Edit:

 

although... it is still a single card effect that adds multiple tokens

One is any. Gloins response makes it seems like those resources are added one by one, creating multiple windows for Harbor Master to trigger. Like you failed to realize while you were writing that post which was in vain  ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

The answer from Caleb:

If Gloin takes 3 damage and gains 3 resources as a result, it is still only 1 instance of resources being added to that hero’s resource pool, which means that the Harbor Master can only get +1 defense as a result.

Yes, after reflection I agree. Nothing to see here.
