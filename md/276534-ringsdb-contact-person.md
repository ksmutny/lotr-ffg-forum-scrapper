Does anyone know how I can contact whoever maintains the RingsDB to report bugs?

I don't think Sydtrack is really doing much maintenance of it any more. It's on GitHub, so technically any of us could make fixes.

If he is still around, I think there’s some contact info at the bottom of the page.

I wrote to that email months ago, but never got a response. :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

When building a deck, if you click on the "? Filter Help" button up top, the example at the bottom says "o:2" will show all cards that cost 2, but the "o" parameter doesn't work.

However, the "o" parameter does work when your browsing all cards, like so...

http://ringsdb.com/find?q=o%3A2&amp;sort=name&amp;view=list [http://ringsdb.com/find?q=o%3A2&sort=name&view=list]

At times when building a deck, I'd really like to filter the list by cost (equal to, greater, or less than) like you can with willpower by using the "w" parameter.
