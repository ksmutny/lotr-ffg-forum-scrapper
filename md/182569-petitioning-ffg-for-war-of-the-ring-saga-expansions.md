# [Petitioning FFG for War of the Ring Saga Expansion(s)](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/182569-petitioning-ffg-for-war-of-the-ring-saga-expansions/)

Dear FFG,

 

Campaign Mode is awesome. That's why we need one or two deluxes covering the events of The War of the Ring which are behind-the-scenes from the paths of Aragorn and Frodo.

 

Those already amazing deluxes could cover:

 

- First (or second) battle of the Fords of Isen (the death of Théodred)

- Battle of Dale (Dwarves, Elves, Dale and Rhovanion men against Easterlings)

- Siege of The Lonely Mountain (the last battle of King Brand and Dain)

- The attack(s) on Lórien by the forces of Dol Guldur

- The throwing-down of Dol Dulgur by Lady Galadriel and the Galadhrims

- Battle for Osgiliath (seems it won't be covered by The Land of Shadow)

 

I guess we could also have some Gondor quests like battle for Pelargir (against the pirates) or coastal battles in Lebennin, Belfalas, etc. but part of it may be covered by Saga Expansion 5.

 

I'm sure there's a lot more to be covered. You have my money. :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

 

EDIT: c'mon Matt, it's not as if you did not have yourself the idea [https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/818448/feonixs-custom-scenario-5-fall-dale]. :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

I fully support this. I remember suggesting the idea earlier this year (or maybe it was last year?) but, yeah, a thread specifically made for this is much better.

Count me in. Excellent idea. And I think the designers must welcome it also: no need to think hard about the next deluxe, instead follow something already written (though some of the cycles are like that -- you know like Hunt for Gollum kind of stuff).

I fully support this idea. This game can clearly handle more releases than 1 deluxe plus a cycle per year, so continuing with saga style boxes beyond the current campaign makes a lot of sense. I think the encounter design in the sagas tends to be more creative since there is less of a need to reuse cards.

I always wondered what kind of adventure happened to Gandalf after he basically died killing the Balrog, appeared as a maiar spirit back in the hall thingamy place, was resurrected and "sent back" and somehow travelled to meet up with aragirn/gimli/legolas. A standalone expansion covering that would be so interesting.

One gandalf hero with all four spheres and gaining 2 or 3 resource per turn, no other heroes but lots of allies, events etc.

I think clever designers could make something fun there.

As far as I can tell he was just send back. Maiar don't go for the Halls of Mandos, but just leave Arda and go back to the place the Valar and other Ainur came from. (Space if you would) It is my understanding t hat Eru send Gandalf back and not the Valar. I am listening to a seminar from the Tolkien Professor about the Unfinished Tales vook which talks about the Istari. After Gandalfs spirit was immedeatly send back to his body/given a new body Gwaihir brought him to Galadriel.
