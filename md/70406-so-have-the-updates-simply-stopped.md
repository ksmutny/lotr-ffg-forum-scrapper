Just seems like the Heirs of Numenor is the only update we have seen in some time. Did they announce that they would be putting them on halt until nearer that release? If so, I missed it. Weekly updates keep this game fresh and engaging to me…without them, I visit FF site less and less.

i dont remember them saying anything like that.  there has been quite a few periods where the news dies down. maybe its all the news we got on hiers of numenor at once…..perhaps they thought it was all too much for us? lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif]

Well GenCon was 2 weeks ago, figure one week recovery from that, and this weekend they had another convention (so the week before they were probably prepping for that). I'd expect something this week.

Yesterday was the third of september. I think it means "labour day" holiday in America so you shouldn't have waited for a news yesterday… Today in another day… :-)

also, there hasn't been much news from FFG of any sort, LOTR, or not.

That's why I've suggested "recovery/prep time" from the conventions, and frankly we did just get a lot from them (SaF - although delayed, The Hobbit I - which still hasn't made it into many shops/player's hands, and two big announcements - 1. HoN and new AtS cycle and 2. BoLT PoD). I'd expect the next hing we get is an announcement for the next Hobbit cycle (or the release of the BoLT PoD), and then alternating previews of HoN and TH2 afterward.

On a side note, I know that FFG announced that The Hobbit would be in 2 packs, but did they ever actually say it would be released at the end of the year?

i found this: "Another expansion, currently scheduled for release later in 2012, will introduce related scenarios that conclude Bilbo’s classic adventure!"

i'm also pretty sure that they said it was coming out end of 2012 at GenCon.

Thanks D! I couldn't remember if we'd actually seen that or made it up (and I wasn't at GenCon, but certainly appreciated your coverage!! gran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif] )
