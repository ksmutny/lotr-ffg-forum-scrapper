Simple question here but one I have run into and I know part of the answer but not the other. If I have an enemy engaged with me but he is trapped and cant attack, is he still dealt a shadow card? I know even if it does it doesnt resolve but I dont know if, since they cant even attack, if they go through that phase and get dealt a shadow card anyway.  Thanks!

He still gets a shadow card.  Just discard it at the end of the phase.  Same goes for enemies affected by Feint.
