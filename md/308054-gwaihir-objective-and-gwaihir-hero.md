If I am running Gwahir Hero and playing Mountain of Fire, and the Gwaihir Objective Ally is revealed from the Encounter Deck, do I have to discard my Gwaihir Hero if the First Player opts to use the When Revealed option that immediately discards the Objective-Ally Gwaihir from play?

That effect clearly reference the objective-ally itself so I don't see why you would need to discard your hero. I think it's more of a question of "does the objective-ally has any sort of effect since it theoretically cannot enter play due to the uniqueness rule?"

I wonder if in the rules booklet of that Adventure Pack you can find any indication about not being able to play Gwahir Hero in the Saga, much like for The One Ring and Master cards in A Shadow in the East.

I would be willing to bet that when the pack with Gwaihir (The Land of Sorrow) is released the rules insert will say something about it.

I think he means in terms of having to discard Hero Arwen when Objective Ally Arwen comes into play, do you have to discard Hero Gwaihir if you only use the Encounter Gwaihir to pay one resource to discard an enemy and not take him under your control.

The ‰ symbol before a card’s title indicates the card is “unique.” The players as a group may have only one copy of each unique card, by title, in play.

 * A player cannot play or put into play a unique card if a copy of that card is already in play.
 * If a unique version of a character enters play from the encounter deck and there is already a copy of that character under a player’s control, that player must discard the version he or she controls.

What is the source of this second stipulation? I don't seem to find anything like this in the FAQ or Rules of the Game (I might be searching wrong)

Yes, the second bullet point is exactly what I have in mind.

So, the question is, if Gwaihir objective-ally reveals from the Encounter Deck, and the First Player opts to use the When Revealed option that discards Gwaihir in order to discard an enemy in the Staging Area, has objective-ally Gwaihir "entered play," thus forcing Hero Gwaihir to discard?  OR, is there some interpretation of When Revealed timing and Entering Play definitions that would mean that the objective-ally character Gwaihir doesn't enter play, and thus the Hero Gwaihir coudl remain in play?


Bonus Question: Assuming that even the discard effect of Objective-Ally Gwaihir's "When Revealed" effect means Gwaihir enters play and Hero Gwaihir is discarded, could the Hero Gwaihir player trigger ally Landroval's response to put Gwaihir back into play?  Or would the timing of that be too wonky?  Can the Response effect of Landroval be triggered as Gwaihir is discarded, but then added to the queue to resolve right behind the When Revealed discarding of Objective-Ally Gwaihir, thus meaning that once Landroval's Response attempts to to trigger Objective-Ally Gwaihir is discarded (when revealed effect resolved) such that Hero Gwaihir could now re-enter play?  Or would Landroval be unable to immediately trigger because Ally-Objective Gwaihir is still in play when Gwaihir Hero is discarded?

Hmm, I was going to say he isn't in play during his when revealed effect, but I don't think that's true. I think he would force the discard of Gwaihir hero.

The rules are a bit vague around complex timing problems like your bonus question. Ideally I would want the sequence to be i) objective ally enters play ii) Hero gwaihir immediately leaves play iii) response window opens for a character leaving play iv) once this response window closes, objective ally continues resolution. This would stop your trick from working. However, this nice structure has been confirmed not to be true on other occasions, so tbh at this point the answer is "depends what mood the designer is in when you ask".

Pretty sure in any quest that runs objective heros/allies you just don't play the corresponding hero from your collection. Simple. Easy.

Didn't think there would have to be a discussion on a pretty self-explanatory one like this.

there's legitimate reason.

Answers to these questions might influence whether you even run a saga campaign with Gwaihir hero and give him boons, for example.

Further, I might be having fun with a deck heavily involving a particular hero or ally, but also might want to play such a quest. When the ally is relatively throwaway like Gwaihir or Gildor, you might be happy for them to just go straight to discard and not get their positive effects.

Having said that, I think an easier solution is just to bend the rules so that allies like that can't enter play, rather than force the hero to leave play. I think the specific rule to discard the player version is to protect the quests that start off with the objective ally. Amusingly, the rules as written don't protect the quests where Na'asiyah shows up midway through, because she shows up from "Out of play" not the encounter deck.

Also if you think this is a silly discussion, I advise you to avoid the legendary "how are cards actually revealed" thread 😀

Theres over 100 heros to play with in this game. If your gonna have a clash cause that hero is an objective ally, then just find another hero. Yes that excludes Gwaihir and Gildor from some campaign quests  but so what? 

There are plenty of choices.

Edit - just read the rules reference link above, which discredits my original comment. Have deleted the erroneous bits but will leave part of it here as it does answer a similar-but-different question.

 

I think there is something in the Shadow and Flame rulesheet that states that if a unique encounter card is revealed whilst a card with the same title is in play, the revealed copy of the unique is discarded immediately with no effect.

Granted, this was referring to two unique encounter cards (Flaming Sword and Fiery Whip, or whatever it's called) rather than one encounter card and one player card.

By the way, the Gwaihir situation will also apply to the Gildor boon in A Shadow of the Past.

This is just a bizarre point of view. I mean I get that your solution is reasonable, but in the context of your first post (basically “I disapprove of this discussion”), your argument is literally “if you think a rule might cause a problem, pick a different hero. We shouldn’t have to have a thread about it.”

Wow, did Gwaihir personally **** in your cheerios this morning?  🤣

There are several reasons to ask this question. 

(1) There are literal rules about how this situation resolves, and that rule is not "just don't run these heroes in the following series of quests."  But Gwaihir's situation is a little different from the typical in that his card has a "when revealed" option that immediately discards the encounter card... this leaves open a question of whether or not a copy of the Gwaihir character has entered play from the Encounter deck, since this game has very particular understandings of certain game terms (e.g. played vs put into play; revealed vs taken from the top of the encounter deck and added to the staging area; etc), and it's unclear how a card that is discarded when revealed interacts with "entering play."

(2) I'm one of the types of players who searches for "One Deck to Rule Them All Builds" because that's what I enjoy most about deck-building challenges.  I find adjusting decks on a quest-by-quest basis to be tedious while often triviliaizing the game's difficulty.  So I like to find decks I can throw against entire series of quests without changes, as a measuring stick to how versatile and resilient the deck itself is.  Anyone can switch to mono-tactics at Seige of Cair Andros and totally cake-walk the thing.  If players simply shouldn't run unique cards that might crop up during a series of questing runs, this would be me "One Deck" players would have to avoid a whole a host of characters (e.g. Grimbeorn, two versions of Arwen, three versions of Faramir, Grima, Amarthuil, Na'Sailyah, Haldan, two version of Gwaihir).

(3) I am the type of player that typically likes to play quests blind the first time I experience them.  I don't scout through the quest cards or the encounter deck to get a sense of what to expect.  There could be cases where such players are playing a quest blind and are as surprised as anyone else that an objective-ally version of one of their hero/ally cards in play pops up into play.  I, for instance, had no idea that Gildor was in the Black Riders Saga Quests until I sat down to play them, or that Grimbeorn was in Conflict at the Carrock until he popped up in my first play through of that one.  Knowing how to resolve these situations is important, because players won't always be in a position to play active defense avoidng them.

(4) Even knowing a character might discard if their Encounter Version appears (e.g. Grimbeorn the Old in Conflict at the Carrock), a One-Deck mentality player might still decide to run a favorite character through a series of quests where they might appear on an objective card.  There are ways to try and avoid the encounter card, or actions a player may take in response if it does show up (e.g. let the objective ally leave play and then Forture or Fate / Houses of Healing / Stand and Fight the hero/ally back into play, have Sneak/Lothiriel+PrinceImrahil ready to replace a lost hero in that quest, etc.).

I think it was clarified that only the "Shadow: " portion of a card is taken into account when resolving shadow effects, so I would say no to that.

But the card still has a Title, right?  Even though you ignore the non-shadow portion at the bottom of a card...

Even if the shadow card is in play with the title Gwaihir, the players don't have it so it doesn't trigger the "The players as a group may have only one copy of each unique card, by title, in play" condition, and it isn't a character nor does it enter play from the encounter deck, so it doesn't trigger the "If a unique version of a character enters play from the encounter deck" condition.

Not much for a little criticism eh? 

1. Whatever the 'literal' rules are exactly, I can't quote word for word but I know what the rule is. Which is what I said.

2. I definitely don't prefer playing 'one deck to rule them all" as there is an extensive cardpool and i would hate to pay that money to run only a few cards. But I understand thats my preference; you can play whatever you prefer.

3. When playing a quest blind and running into a unique clash, I would just play on. Since you had no way of knowing, I would not invalidate that attempt. Just remember for next time to avoid the clash.

4. This is not really a legit strategy. You cannot run a version of a character if they are present in that quest already. No hero recursion can change that. You simply have to play a different hero.

It is a question that has been answered in multiple places (for example, the new hero smeagol has rules that say he can't be used in the shadows of Mirkwood cycle due to... You guessed it. Uniqueness clashes).

Unless your a new player, you know this... Nothing bizarre about it.

## 23 [dalestephenson on May 2, 2020](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/308054-gwaihir-objective-and-gwaihir-hero/?do=findComment&comment=3933431)

To be fair, Smeagol escorting Gollum through Mirkwood is much more of a thematic mismatch than discarding Gwaihir hero because a Gwaihir-related encounter card was used to discard an enemy in staging.  I mean, shouldn't that effect be *more* likely to happen thematically if Gwaihir is your actual hero?

(Of course, given Smeagol's split personality, Smeagol escorting Gollum through Mirkwood is actually pretty darn thematic, come to think of it....)

Taking a step back, it's important to recognize that the uniqueness identifier serves two purposes in the game, one thematic (can't have the same character in play twice) and one balance related -- Steward of Gondor needs to be unique not because only one character should thematically be able to enjoy the patronage of the Steward of Gondor, but because being able to have any number of SoG in play would be mechanically unbalancing.  Mixing objective and player-chosen allies of the same name creates *no* mechanical or balance issues, it's purely a thematic constraint, and I'm not inclined to bust anyone's chops for using "Barwen" or "Bamarthiul" to work around a thematic constraint.  It's perfectly legal in this game to send Balin to investigate the fate of his colony in Moria, or send Eowyn on a journey to defeat Smaug.

I also think that closing off play space really is a loss.  Grimbeorn hero can't be used in Conflict at the Carrock, despite Grimbeorn hero being the second-likeliest hero to go to the Carrock in the first place.  Dunedain decks are by far the most thematic for playing Angmar cycle, and Amarthiul is one of the very best Dunedain heroes -- but he can't be used because of the objective ally, even though the story really isn't about him at all.  Faramir is the *ideal* thematic hero for all the events in HoN/AtS up until Blood of Gondor, and if you merely pretend that Boromir was captured instead of Faramir he would be the ideal thematic rescuer for the last two quests.  And for years, people have wondered why the Eagles didn't just fly the ring into Mordor, so closing off the one Eagle hero from the complete campaign saga really is a thematic loss (not to mention barring the hero from the *one battle* he actually was at!)

There's no wrong way to play this game.

I’d simply play it as a different Gwaihir.  Perhaps it is a common name amongst eagles.  So I’d keep it in play.

I guess I have always been a theme player, and a stickler for the rules... It just seems wrong to play them in quests where they are already present. But it is a game and if that is what you want to do then its really up to you. 

The thing is, I recently placed black gate/Mt Doom and thoroughly enjoyed the Gwaihir objective that I earned and took to Mt. Doom. It was such a thematic win when he came off the encounter deck and discarded and orc. I don't want to see Gwaihir as a starting hero in my deck in those quests. I want him to come out of the encounter deck and surprise me while doing something amazing, as he was intended to do.

I understand the Smeagol case, and you keep seeming to reference it as the rule in this situation, which is: "Players are not allowed to run a unique character that appears in the encounter deck as an objective ally."  But, to be technical (as one probably should with any rules question), this is not the general rule, as the Smeagol case is a particular exception to that.  The general rule that has long existed is that if the Encounter deck reveals a unique card that is already in play as a player card, that player card is discarded.

The rules completely allow (as far as I've always been aware) for a player to run Grimbeorn the Old during the Conflict at the Carrock, even though Grimbeorn the Old also exists as an Objective-Ally in that Quest's encounter deck.  There's just a risk that, IF Grimbeorn the Old reveals form the Encounter deck--which isn't terribly likely in 1-Handed and can be avoided entirely through effects that scrye the Encounter deck like Firyal, Lorethor, Scout Ahead, etc.--the player must discard Grimbeorn the hero.  This is how it has always worked for these sorts of cases (Smeagol's special rules in ASITE exist presumably because he's especially thematically weird to have running around as a primary hero in the Mirkwood cycle since the players are supposed to be trying to find him during the entire Mirkwood cycle, and he already starts in play in 33% of the quests as an Encounter card).  So the Smeagol ruling you keep referring as the "answer" to this question is not, in fact, the answer to this question.  It's only an answer to the question "Can I run Smeagol in Mirkwood?"  It has no bearing on the general form of this question: "What happens if the encounter deck reveals a unique card that is already in play as a player card?"  And we already know the answer to that question.

We know how the rules work with unique objective-ally cards like Grimbeorn:  If the character enters play from the Encounter Deck, it discards any other player card copy of the character (hero or ally).  So if Objective-Ally Gwaihir character enters play, Gwaihir Hero or Ally would be discarded immediately.  But Gwaihir is an odd case, because his When Revealed effect has an option that immediately discards him for an effect ... and the big question is if the players choose that option, does Objective-Ally Gwaihir Character enter play? Or does the character not enter play?  Subtle timing of things, especially those involving "revealing" cards, is not a clear-cut issue.

I can only wonder why would you run Gwaihir, or Grimbeorn, or whoever in a quest where they are present already. Its not just about your deck; its about the quest as well. The designers didn't insert cool objective allies into quests so that we can ignore them, or worse, try find ways to discard them.

Theres enough terrible cards in the deck, why get rid of one that helps you...

When a quest is designed with certain objective allies, the designers expect you to use them properly because they are part of the quest.

Btw I only mentioned Smeogol to you once... As 1 example. Heres more.

If Gwaihir or Grimboern or whoever is you're favorite hero, then you're going to want to run them as much as possible.  Especially in the campaign if you give him permanent boons.

So you have to options.

1. Play by the rules of the game.

In this case, even if its your favorite hero, you gotta find a different one to avoid uniqueness clashes. Sure its your favorite but as I previously mentioned in this thread, theres over 100 heros. Just find another one. Trust me, it will be fine. 

2. Disregard the rules.

Hey its your game, if in your own private game you wanna run a uniqueness clash, no one is going to stop you! Go for it. However, if you play in a public setting (Con of the Rings) disregarding rules is generally frowned upon.

Hey guys I know this is a heated discussion, but i would like some clarity...

A unique encounter ally that appears that happens to have the same name as a character you have in play forces the discard of the already in play character, right?

I think this question needs to be asked-- I like bringing gildor in my Gandalf/vilya decks but my sister chose the gildor boon for saga play. I would still like to bring him as an ally and I still think discarding him after a couple of uses makes him worth it... also running the risky play that gildor might not show at all.

This is correct.  Strategically, I think you're also right that Gildor Ally is still worth running.  As you note, about the half the time Gildor Objective-Ally probably won't reveal from the Encounter deck (he may be discarded as a Shadow Effect instead or you may not stage through the whole Encounter Deck), and in those cases having Gildor ally still as an option is worth it.  Even when Gildor Objective-Ally comes up and discards Gildor-Actual-Ally from play, having Gildor as your chosen Boon is still probably worth it because having a player-card without Surge in the Encounter deck is amazingly powerful -- when Gildor stages, it means you've effectively staged one less card during the Quest, which can be a huge swing for the players.  Even then, you can let Gildor Objective-Ally later leave play (sacrificing him to attacks or cards like Bulwark of the West or simply not paying his upkeep) to allow you to again play a copy of Gildor Ally from your deck.

At this point, I have to wonder if you are trolling.  As has now been pointed out a few times in this thread: that is not what the rules of the game actually say.  There are no rules that say you cannot choose to run Grimbeorn in Conflict at the Carrock or that you cannot run Gildor during the LotR Saga.  Choosing to run those characters means accepting the risk that they may be lost to an Encounter card version of themselves entering play, but it does not violate any game rules.  Even the question in the OP recognizes that IF objective Gwaihir enters play it means Hero/Ally Gwaihir must be discarded.  The question, instead, is does Objective-Ally Gwaihir "enter play" if the discard option of his When Revealed is chosen by First Player.

I would say that since Gildor is actually present in the quest(since your sister chose him as a boon), the ally (or hero) version of him should not be used during those quests due to the unique clash. 

Since you are running Gandalf with Elrond and Vilya (very powerful combo) I would suggest playing the Imladris stargazer instead? Shes thematic (kind of), cheap, and is excellent for setting up Vilya. Gandalfs pipe can set up cards in your hand

I am only saying that uniqueness clashes should be avoided. Caleb designed the black gate/Mt Doom with Gwaihir as an objective ally and this is part of the quest. So I don't think the hero Gwaihir is meant to be played here, because Caleb designed the quest with him as an ally, and one that is meant to be part of the quest. Bringing that particular hero is clashing with a part of the quests mechanics.

I am not trolling EBerling, I am simply saying that if uniqueness clashes were applied in every game, then Gwaihir is not a legitimate option, but only for Black Gate/Mt Doom. He is free game in any other quest though.

But that's not "only" what you have been saying.  You're expressing your opinion, not the actual rules on the situations in question.  Which is fine--I firmly believe that everyone should play this game however they prefer.  But you've used this thread to tell people that they are not following the rules (e.g. "Play by the rules of the game"), when really all that you should be claiming is that, in your own opinion, you'd approach certain situations differently.  I think that's what causing the points of confusion/tension.  Heck, your way of approaching it (avoiding the characters in particular quests) is probably the safest and most rational approach, but other players may have legitimate reasons to want to stick with a particular character(s) in a particular quest despite the risk of losing them to Encounter card versions of themselves.

> Let's say you love playing thematically and you enjoy running Grimbeorn and the Beorning subtheme -- there is no more thematic quest in the entire game than Conflict at the Carrock to do so.  You could rationalize losing Grimbeorn Hero to his Encounter version as "he's gone into a terrible fit of Bear-Rage and is no longer as reliable or dependable, until you can coax him into calming down and working with the team again (e.g., spend enough Leadership Resources to bring him back to his less animalistic senses).  Someone may really want to play Gwaihir in the LotR Saga, especially since giving him Boons like Valiant Warrior and Intimidation are some interesting ways to beef him up, considering in particular that the game's range of non-restricted attachments he can be equipped with are already pretty slim.  If a Player wants to run a Gwaihir deck through the entire Saga, recognizing that they might lose him to an Encounter card in the final quest, well what's wrong with that?  They still get to use him for 19 of the 20 quests without issues, and again thematically it can be that Gwaihir--being a big wild bird and all--tears off from the group to go help his flock against the enemy.  These are just two possibilities off the top of my head--less thematic "One Deck" players might just want to see if they can get a deck using Character X through the quest(s) that said character is a possible encounter card objective-ally, since that will be one hurdle to the One Deck's run since that quest will mean they are down (or might be down) that character for the quest.

Yes you can make a quest work if you create a scenario for yourself, like the examples you mentioned, where you run a character who is already present or in the encounter deck.

Its just that while I can't pull up a specific ruling here, I do believe its more than my opinion. I do agree with you that people should play the game the way they want to and have fun, but I think the uniqueness clash is a legit argument. For example, if you play Celebrians Stone on your hero and I draw my copy, the reason I can't play it is because its already in play and since 2 Celebrians stones don't exist in the world of middle earth, 2 can't possibly be in play. Thats how the game has worked. How can Gwaihir be under your control and come off the encounter deck at the same time? In reality he can't because this game doesn't allow 2 of the same characters to be in play at the same time.

But I know we don't agree that this rule is right and I can't pull out an official document, its just what I know as a long time player of this game. Im a bit of a nerd and probably know every player card off the top of my head. But ultimately it is a game and the aim is to have fun. I don't mean to spoil fun for anyone, I love this game and think its a great community too.

It's kinda the same thing, just as much as a unique card can be present in two decks at the same table, but only be played if there is not already a copy in play by the same token a card can be both in a player deck and in an encounter deck. If there is a situation in which both the player and encounter version "meet" the encounter deck version by the rules takes precedende.

If you want to go down that road (no unique cards in my deck which I know are copies of cards in an encounter deck) then you should play by taking away the chance to have copies of the same unique card in different decks. Which is definitely a legitimate way to play and you are welcome to do it. Just don't pretend it's the "right" way to play morally or by the actual rules.

I think we're ships passing in the night, at this point.  I'm certainly not suggesting that there be two copies of the same unique card in play at the same time.  The rules most assuredly do not allow for that.  But, again, that's not and has never been the question being asked here.

Oh Im not pretending at all, I can assure you.

I don't think 'morally' is an appropriate term here as we are talking about a game, not a court matter, but alas, I think we are all worn out on this discussion. 

As EBerling poetically puts it, we are just kinda ships passing. I think you understand what I am saying, but we may just have to agree to disagree.

Why would you run Gwaihir and Grimbeorn or whoever in a quest where they are present already?  *Because you want to*.  It's that simple.  It's a cooperative game, so what the player *wants* is not a matter of small significance to be brushed aside.  In addition, Gwaihir is a *highly* thematic pick for Black Gate/Mount Doom, and was canonically present at both locations -- but there's no guarantee that Gwaihir will show up in Mount Doom or be earned for Mount Doom at all.  Grimbeorn is a *highly* thematic pick for a quest whose *premise* is about Grimbeorn getting mad and charging down the trolls at his Carrock -- but he may not show up at all and if he shows up may not be earned.

In the case of Gwiahir, the designers *explicitly* added a cool objective ally into the quest *and* gave us a way to discard him!  Besides, the designers have done their bit already.  Our job is not to do the things that the *designer* would do in our place to maximize his enjoyment, but to do the things that maximize *our* enjoyment.

Why get rid of a helpful card in the encounter deck?  Because you want to play Gwaihir against Black Gate a quest where he was *canonically present*.  Why would another reason be needed?

It's true that certain quests with objective-allies are designed to be "used properly" because they are mechanically required for quest balance.  Playing Nin-in-Eleph without Nalir would be both less difficult and more enjoyable, but that's not how the quest is designed.  Ally Arwen in Redhorn Gate and Road to Rivendell is mechanically required by the scenario design.  But no one has suggested *eliminating* the Arwen ally, the "Barwen" solution keeps the quest mechanically the exact same, it only permits player cards to be played which have *no effect* on the mechanical design of the quest.  The only complaint is thematic, and if you put a different name on Arwen's hero card (or ally card), the thematic issue goes away.

Grimbeorn and Gwaihir are in a different category.  They are favorable encounter cards that you might never see at all, and even if you do see them they might never be under your control.  They are *not* remotely integral to the design of the scenarios.

AFAIK, there is absolutely no prohibition of using "3 unique Harad allies" in Long Arm of Mordor.  Nothinig in my printed copy of either Sands of Harad or Mumakil seems to exclude them.  Obviously the uniqueness rules would cause an objective hero *in play* from blocking their ally counterparts, but unless you're playing four player there may be allies that are not in play.  Why wouldn't you be able to play Jubayr if objective-hero Firyal was in play, or all three of the Harad allies if Kahliel were the objective-hero.  Indeed, it would be *highly thematic* to get unused Harad allies and/or Kahliel in play during this quest, because it's their hometown under assault!

Unless I'm missing something, Blood of Gondor does not have a scenario-specific rule prohibiting Faramir, as the objective ally starts in play and remains in play after being captured, uniqueness rules are sufficient.  Morgul Vale *does* remove Faramir from the game, this is purely a thematic touch and not required mechanically to make the quest work.

Amarthiul in Wastes/Ettenmoors/Rhuadar does not have a scenario-specific rule and relies solely on uniqueness to exclude hero Amarthiul.  Escape From Mount Gram does not prohibit Amarthiul, even though the text has Amarthiul doing the rescuing.  Aside from the uniqueness conflict, there is no *mechanical* reason to forbid Amarthiul's use in those quests, indeed, since Dunedain is *the* most thematic build to run in that cycle, Dunedain decks relying on the powers of hero Amarthiul are unnecessarily handicapped by being restricted, powers that the objective ally does *not* duplicate.  And since Amrthiul is an *invented* hero, I see no grave thematic harm in renaming one or the other for these scenarios.

In reality he can't because this game doesn't allow 2 of the same characters to be in play at the same time.

If Gwaihir comes off the encounter deck *and is used for the enemy discard*, it never even reaches staging.  In practical terms, what you have is not "two Gwaihirs in play", but Gwaihir dropping an enemy from a great height, which (thematically) is incredibly fitting when Gwaihir is already in play!

It's important to remember that the uniqueness rules serve a dual purpose in the game, and the thematic clash of having two of a unique object in play is arguably the less important of the two.  Being able to guarantee a single copy will be in play allow cards to be more powerful than non-unique cards at the same price.  Celebrian's Stone provides 2 willpower for 2 leadership resources, the best willpower bargain in the entire core set.  Allowing multiples doesn't just create a thematic problem, it could be a *balance* problem in that environment, though not as badly as multiple Stewards of Gondor.  There is only one Celebrian's Stone and it's unique.  But Palantir *also* has the uniqueness indicator despite multiple palantirs existing, and two separate heroes that personally own (different) Palantirs.  There are *lots* of elves with the Light of Valinor -- but it has the unique symbol all the same.  There's abstract concepts like Hardy Leadership and Visionary Leadership that are "unique",  but multiple copies of these non-unique things in play certainly could cause balance issues.

No one is calling for uniqueness rules to be repealed in general.

Luckily there is no need for a ruling as this is directly addressed in the Rules Reference:

Ok, so I think the consensus is:

1.  As a shadow effect, Gwaihir does not force a Gwaihir Hero discard.

2.  As a when revealed effect, Gwaihir still forces a Gwaihir Hero discard even if you immediately use his ability to discard him from play.

So if you run this quest with hero Gwaihir, uses Firyal, LoDenethor, Scout Ahead and other such tactics to try and avoid the noid.
