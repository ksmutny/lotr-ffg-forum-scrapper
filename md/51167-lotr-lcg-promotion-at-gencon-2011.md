# [LOTR: LCG promotion at GenCon 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/51167-lotr-lcg-promotion-at-gencon-2011/)

Strange that it hasn't been posted (or seen) in the GenCon video recap. LOTR: LCG is a young game and I think that's important to do some marketing and promotion in well-known events like GenCon.

Yes, we know that in that event people had the chance to play a new exclusive scenario (it will be in PoD) and test the new adventure pack, but still...

Maybe next year it will be more played, maybe FFG will create a tournament mode comparing session scores. I still have faith on this game, although it concerns me (just a bit) the lack of promotion it had at GenCon 2011...

It'd be great to know from people at GenCon (maybe FFG staff) if LOTR: LCG went well (in terms of people playing the game and expectations). I have read some thoughts at BGG, but they are more card reviews than anything!

Let's see how all of this develops in the next months! No need to worry I guess!

As far as I understand LotR LCG is selling very well, so FFG maybe decided to feature Products in their video(s) that either need a bit of an advertisement boost or new games which will be published in the next couple of months???

Yes, I heard the same (do you know of a web that registers these kind of sells?). And I feel the same, games like Elder Sign, new Star Wars games (both board and LCG) or Gears of War: The Board Game need some love now that they hit/are going to hit stores.

However, "older games" in the LCG line such as Game of Thrones (very popular in a competitive environment), Warhammer: Invasion and Call of Cthulhu had their moment of "shininess" even in the GenCon video recaps. Plus Star Wars LCG (which I am quite interested), being the new LCG jewel as it is.

I know that competitive gameplay can appeal more than the cooperative (hence the sheer amount of AGoT, W:I tournaments) but even though I found a bit strange less promotion in a new game like LOTR: LCG (I think it hit stores in early 2011? So it is quite new).

I am surprised only by the fact that GenCon 2011 didn't put LOTR in first line. Well, at least that's what I perceive from the outside (I couldn't go to GenCon, a bit far for me :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]).

But as I told before, it is still too soon to be afraid of. I have faith that FFG has a great planning from this game :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] .

Further, the new expansion was released without even a main page announcement. All we had was an update in the "store" section to indicate it was now "in stock". Compared to the multiple annoucements we had for The Hunt for Gollum, one has to wonder if the staff dedicated to LotR were just too busy with the convention to monitor their own website?

No, but the 1st printing of the core game sold out within few months, 1st printing of Hunt for Gollum sold out at the FFG-Store in two weeks.

I have the feeling that after the first expansion cycle has been designed/printed/announced now, FFG has moved technical staff from LotR to other products and LotR is receiving minimal corporate attention marketingwise. I wouldnt be surprised if only one product manager is left assigned to LotR at the moment (who is most prolly responsible for other game lines as well).

What you two are saying could be true. Well, maybe they haven't announced CaC yet because in Europe it hasn't hit the stores in most of the countries that normally receive the expansions. But as SiCK_Boy stated, FFG normally makes pre-previews, previews and "now in store!" announcements days (or weeks) before.

So staff movement to other games could be the best answer to this. If it is, I hope that it won't be permanent!

I would just like to echo the comments above, it is VERY disappointing that ZERO time was spent on LOTR :LCG. As a new game and with its recent issues surrounding shipping dates i would have expected at least a mention and quick pan over people trying the Print on Demand expansion.

It looks to me like FFG have abandoned this game in favour of their new toys DUST and Star Wars, the lack of marketing and news announcements, the minimal effort initially on the FAQ document, the delays in shipping could so easily be because they prioritised other products.

It is very telling as well that the concerns raised repeatedly here and at prominent gamer websites such as BGG that a "completion pack" that adds the missing duplicate cards so players could have 3 x each player card without purchasing multiple base games and adding cards to their collection that are essentially useless (i.e multiple quest cards and encounter sets). PS i bought 2 x base set.

Now i know the above comes across very negative, but dont get me wrong i think this game is GREAT and the fact it scales from solo play to group is brilliant, i like the duality of quest/encounter vs player deck and can see so many oppurtunities for FFG to expand the game and include such things as Moria, Smaug, Mumaks,maiir etc.

Heres hoping that FFG return from the convention take note of our concerns and correct the situation, if note the chances of me buying into future FFG LCG's like star wars reduces due to my lack of faith in them supporting the endevour.

Some quick thoughts from someone who attended GenCon...

They had 3 demo tables set up for LotR, and they were always full.  There was a banner in that area that was as large as any of their other game banners.  I can also tell you that all of their stock for Hunt for Gollum and Conflict at Carrock was sold out by Saturday morning.  It may have sold out Friday, but I only noticed the empty shelf space Saturday.

As far as promotion AT THE CON, it was as heavily promoted as any of their other games, in terms of visibility and demo tables.

Well that's a thing that I wanted to hear ! Some fresh thoughts from people who went at GenCon. From what you said I can see that LOTR was far from forgotten :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] . Then this feeling of "lack of promotion" can be placed outside the convention if we want, but I see that inside things went smooth and well !

Thanks Bootylactin!

It may simply be that lack of news has been as a result of FFG being fully focused on Gen Con and therefor not actually at the office anyway. I suspect that is the most likely explanation.

I agree, it was disappointing that there wasn't a mention in the videos but let's not make a mountain out of a mole-hill

i agree. the new SW:LCG didn't get a mention, either, only the minis game (IIRC).

What does worry me though, is that mountain of unsold LOTR LCG Core Sets that appear behind one of the interview-ees in video four. They were talking about how they pretty much sold out of everything else, but there is a MASSIVE amount of those core sets left... sad.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sad.gif]

Yeah, it's because everyone in the WORLD already has one! ha ha ha!

i had the exact same thought...

"Everyone already has one" is an interesting point though. This seems to be the weakness of the LCG model. And with no competitive scene for this game, it's a little disconcerting. And I want to support the heck out of this game because I love it so much, but all of this is just starting to make me wonder if LOTR is just the stepping stone between AGoT and Star Wars...

I hope it is not the way, Conykchameleon. As a matter of fact, I am going to buy a 2nd core set gran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif], so one LOTR less in that mountain in the video, haha!

Do you imagine the day they announce Deluxe Expansions (such as AGoT, W:I), one for each sphere, with new cards + the old ones that we don't have 3 copies. It will be hilariously delicious !

Oh goodness I hope they don't do that! Those who bought 2-3 Core Sets (including myself) would probably be very angry. On that topic though, I really hope the big box expansion is themed around a specific set of events, rather than a player sphere.

If anyone has an extra set of encounter cards they don't want, I would buy them ($5+shipping) from you.
