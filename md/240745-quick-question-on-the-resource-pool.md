When a Hero dies, do the remaining resource tokens in his resource pool get discarded too?

Yep. And the damage and attachments.

Ouch -- While playing Seventh level, I just foolishly assigned Dain Ironfoot to defend against a Goblin Spearman (3 attack), thinking ole Dain can handle just about anything (even though he had 2 damage points already) but I pulled the Goblin Tunnels as a shadow card (+3 attack if attacking enemy is a Goblin).  Game, set, match.  I think I would have won if any other shadow card came up.  **Sigh**
