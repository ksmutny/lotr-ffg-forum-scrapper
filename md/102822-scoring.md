Simple guestion: Do you count first turn as 10 points or only next turn as 10 points.

 

PS: Hope you can understand what i tried to ask XD

## 2 [Noccus on March 31, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/102822-scoring/?do=findComment&comment=1033604)

Every turn as far as I know, so the first turn too.

## 3 [GrandSpleen on March 31, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/102822-scoring/?do=findComment&comment=1033784)

You add 10 points at the end of the refresh phase iirc.  So if you finish the game DURING round 1 (which I did one time, in the Flight from Moria quest!), you will *not* add 10 points to your score for that round.

So true.

## 6 [entMoot on April 1, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/102822-scoring/?do=findComment&comment=1034071)

Just to confirm what others have said, on page 22 of the rulebook, under Scoring: "Players tally each round for their score at the end of the refresh phase."

 

Was the only difference in the old scoring system that you didn't add points for each round?

## 7 [GrandSpleen on April 1, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/102822-scoring/?do=findComment&comment=1034118)

yup.  I guess it encouraged folks to just hang around, round after round, to heal up and lower threat via card effects, or collect victory points, until their score was nice and high.  So they added the +10 points per round thing.

## 8 [PsychoRocka on April 1, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/102822-scoring/?do=findComment&comment=1034192)

Instead the new system encourages you to use one of only two or three uber decks that can actually beat a quest in just a few turns so that you can get a decent score. Makes slow build decks utter crap score wise, makes going for VP cost you in score rather than improve your score and rewards you for speeding through a quest rather than taking your time which to me is not thematic or fun

## 9 [PsychoRocka on April 1, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/102822-scoring/?do=findComment&comment=1034210)

Not disagreeing with you by the way Grandspleen, just what I think the new scoring system encourages now. The old one definitely was faulty as well but in my opinion was easily the lesser of two evils compared to the new system.

## 10 [Nerdmeister on April 1, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/102822-scoring/?do=findComment&comment=1034232)

Use the new scoring system myself but don´t specifically build decks for it.

Think I would have been a bigger fan of something like 5 points for each round as 10 points seems a pretty big punishment for using 1 or 2 rounds extra but I strive to do things by the book.

## 11 [PsychoRocka on April 1, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/102822-scoring/?do=findComment&comment=1034245)

Yeah i was actually thinking about that, If it had only been 2 or 5 threat a round I would probably use that system... 10 per round is just crazy, thats more or less an extra dead hero's worth of score loss every round.

## 12 [entMoot on April 1, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/102822-scoring/?do=findComment&comment=1034247)

Thanks for clarifying that.

As it is, I often catch myself miscounting the rounds, or at least being unsure of the count, even if I use dice/tokens to track rounds. The result has been that I usually know my score according to the old rules, and then am within 20 points for the current rules. When playing a familiar scenario, I am usually better at remembering to count rounds, though.

## 13 [PsychoRocka on April 1, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/102822-scoring/?do=findComment&comment=1034259)

Well if you end up using the old system feel free to add me as I use the old one

I have just placed the dice for counting rounds right next to the threat dial. To me it has become a natural thing to up the round count just after threat increase because I can´t miss the die.

There are decks that if you dont play in new system score, you always close the game (not matters which scenario) with 0 score.

## 16 [Dwarf king Bronze beard on April 1, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/102822-scoring/?do=findComment&comment=1034397)

OK, I'm listening.

Dude! You finished FfM first round? That had to be some lucky draws!

I've only heard about people finishing AoO single player first round.

Are there any other possible cases that I'm not aware of?

## 19 [Mndela on April 2, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/102822-scoring/?do=findComment&comment=1035599)

I think it is possible: you reveal tools in first round, and the quest card is the one that needs 4 tokens from tools, and you are playing boromir.

> I think it is possible: you reveal tools in first round, and the quest card is the one that needs 4 tokens from tools, and you are playing boromir.

Or you reveal the one where you discard an encounter card, if it's a treachery you die. It's not a treachery, and you quest the heck out of it.

## 21 [Mndela on April 2, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/102822-scoring/?do=findComment&comment=1035793)

It is hard to get so. But possible.

## 22 [GrandSpleen on April 2, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/102822-scoring/?do=findComment&comment=1035902)

Mndela is right, Boromir dug us to victory.  The quest card was Hasty Council, which revealed the next two quest cards and allowed us to choose Escape from Darkness (the one you need the tools for).  Then the tools came out as the first reveal during staging, and Crumbling Ruin guarded it, so the tools were immediately free of encounters after we resolved that.    Hi-ho Boromir and we were done before the combat phase.

 

This was a two-player game.  The other player was like, "uh... go team."

Um, tools say refresh action, right?

## 24 [GrandSpleen on April 2, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/102822-scoring/?do=findComment&comment=1035943)

nope.

Abandoned tools gains: "REFRESH action: Exhaust attached hero to do stuff"

## 26 [GrandSpleen on April 2, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/102822-scoring/?do=findComment&comment=1036169)

ah, you're right, sorry about that.  I was looking at the action to claim the item on the tool card itself.  

 

This game was more than a year ago, I opened up my quest log for the little narrative above.  We must have finished in the refresh phase.  

 

And just to relate this back to the thread topic, that wouldn't count 10 points onto the score since the 10 points are added "at the end of the refresh phase" per the FAQ.

## 27 [Dwarf king Bronze beard on April 3, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/102822-scoring/?do=findComment&comment=1036953)

So refresh action must be triggered during refresh phase, i didnt never thinked that XD
