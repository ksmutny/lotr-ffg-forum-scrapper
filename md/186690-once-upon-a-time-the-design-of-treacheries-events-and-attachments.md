I never realized that they had a different design for treacheries, events and attachments in mind when they were developing the game:

I can understand why they changed the attachments, but the event cards would look way cooler like this.

I don't see what's different about them.

They're sidways, like quest cards.

I don't think that's the case. When they make this kind of stock images they don't actually put physical cards and take a picture, but rather use the digital image of the cards and make them look like they're displayed on a table with Photoshop. With that said, I don't think they were supposed to be designed sideways but just digitally displayed sideways like the Goblin Sniper and Necromancer's Path, and due to the effect of foreshortening they sorta look like they are horizontally designed. But if this was the case, they would have the same length as the player card facedown right next to it, and it's clearly shorter. That means that the cards were not designed to be horizontal.

This image explains it better. The orange line shows the length of the cards, which if they had been designed horizontally, would be the same.

Locations used to look way different. Also, characters used to have a faction symbol.

 I feel cheated by both FFG and my eyes! And I swear I didn't take any drugs when I posted this...

They just turned some cards 90 degrees in that picture. That's all.
