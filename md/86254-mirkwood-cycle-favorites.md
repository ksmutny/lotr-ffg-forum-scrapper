What's your top 2 favorite Mirkwood cycle quests(In order)?  Why?

 

Cannot tell you myself since I only own 3/6 due to them being out of stock.  They are the some of the small amount of expansions I do NOT own.   I'm going to grab them as soon as I can though.

my favourite has and always will be hunt for gollum. im not sure whether it is because it was the 1st Ap so has a special place in my collection, or whether it is just a great, well balanced quest with great art...probably both.

 

2nd choice is harder- they probably all come 2nd in different ways. return to mirkwood is up there in multihanded play, emyn muil has some of the best art, dead marshes is really unique, conflict at the carrock was the first major 'fighting quest', rhosgobel is again unique story telling

 

the whole cycle is still my favourite out of the two (i guess its too early to tell with ATS)

hm ... I finished the cycle solo a couple of weeks ago .. I would go for Journey to Rhosgobel (maybe cause it is the only one I used solo my favourite tactics sphaire and won) , and also Return to Mirkwood cause it is tricky, quick and needs attention

 

Double playing I liked most the Hills of Emyl Myin (my wife also) ... or I should say that I enjoyed it most, and still we have not managed to win it double hehehehhe

1. Conflict at the Carrock

2. Dead Marshes

 

This was actually pretty tough for me to decide because as a cycle, i think mirkwood had a lot of growing pains as the developers went through quest design.  It seems like most of the quests require a specific kind of deck to beat them which i generally dislike. A deck that is suitable to beat Conflict at the Carrock will likely not be able to beat Emyn Muil, neither of which would likely beat Journey to Rhosgobel.

 

that being said i like conflict at the carrock because it was the first big battle quest and i like dead marshes because its a quick fun quest you can play several times in succession.

 

on a side note: only reason Hunt for Gollum didnt make the list is because Hunters of Morder were the scourge of my existence when i started playing haha.

Yes HFG is very cool! I believe nightmare version should be amazing

1) A Journey to Rhosgobel, I think.  I just like helping that little guy out.

 

2) Return to Mirkwood.  The challenge is just right for 2 players.  And the treachery cards are really great -- you can feel just how annoying and dangerous Gollum is.  Also, "Gollum's Bite" makes me giggle.

1) Conflict at the Carrock - It's the only scenario with a good fighting mechaninc, plus it has one of the really few beornings we've seen so far (2 of them being Beorn). It requires good planning (if you rush to the carrock in turn one the trolls will probably smite you but if you take too long your threat will force you to engage all of them and they'll smite you anyway). Plus in this cycle I think FFG hadn't thought solo play through as almost every scenario is really easy in solo play, or extremely hard (return to mirkwood) and CatC is one of the few that poses some kind of challenge.

 

2) The Hunt for Gollum - I like the story behind it, where all your errands begin, and I really like the art of this scenario. Plus this is one of those few decently balanced quest for solo play in this cycle (though it's still pretty easy).

i'm surprised journey to rhosgobel is earning so may high regards, i would have thought it would be near the bottom. interesting indeed

1. Conflict at the Carrock - i just like puching trolls in the face.

 

2. The Dead Marshes - i like it because of the story and the mechanics although is a very easy quest in which i have not been beaten once.

Interesting to see that no one have mentioned Emyn Muil.

I like Emyn Muil. Its a great quest, the problem is that it's too easy.  It needs something more.

Actually with the cards now, quite beatable it would be.

1. The Hills of Emyn Muil

 

I love the atmosphere, I love the art, I love the idea. When I want to play sometimes an easy quest without ridiculous encounter draws I play this scenario.

 

2. A Journey to Rhosgobel

 

Like above I love the atmosphere. And since I am a big fan of Lore-Sphere, a healing quest is exactly what I was looking for.

Hills of Emyn Muil! It's my favourite all-time quest! 

 

I also love Hunt for Gollum, but my second choice would have to be Dead Marshes. There's nothing like the moment of utter panic when, after a fairly leisurely early game when you manage to place tokens on Gollum and all seems well, you suddenly fail that escape test and he scampers off into the marshes, causing the entire quest to become a race against the clock to get him back!
