The card text reads:

Attach to a character.

Action: Exhaust Self Preservation to heal 2 points of damage from attached character.

Can I use this to heal just 1 point of damage?  Maybe I am interpreting this too literally, but since the card does not say "heal up to 2 points of damage" do I have to wait until I acquire 2 points of damage before I can use this attachment?

i think it means heal up to 2 damage, i think its just worded differently, at least thats the way ive been playing it. so you can heal 1 damage or 2

….strange that it doesnt say 'up to' like daughter of the nimrodel..i rarely use this card so id wait for somone else to clarify

I think if there is only 1 damage on the character, you can use it to heal that 1 damage -- no problem.  But if you have 2 damage, I don't think you can use it to heal only 1 and leave 1 damage on the character (for Gimli, for example).  It would need to say "up to 2 damage," as rich points out.  There are cards that are worded that way, such as Warden of Healing and A Very Good Tale.
