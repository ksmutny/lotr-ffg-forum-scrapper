There have been 3 Dwarves, 3 Rohan, 2 Gondor, 2 Dúnedain, 1 Noldor and 1 Silvan Heroes in the core set. As spoiled, there will be 2 Hobbit Heroes coming in the first two expansions. Plus, it has been hinted that Boromir (likely) as a Gondor Hero is coming in the fifth. I guess and hope there will be at least one more Elven (likely Silvan) Hero in the expansion 3 or 4. The remaining spot may probably be kept for another Dúnedain perhaps.

What do you think? Moreso, not just traits but names. We've just seen Éomund as an Ally and I bet for Éomer as a Hero. But how about an Elf? Thranduil, just to have another family bond covered? Or something more Noldor like Elrond? I think I read long ago that Elrond is going to be a Hero although thematically he seems more fit as an Ally. That doesn't mean much though as we've seen Denethor a Hero already.

Beravor, Thalin, and Eleanor are also heroes from Middle-earth Quest.  I wouldn't be surprised if the other two heroes from that game are released as heroes.  Argalad is an Elf, probably Silvan like Legolas, and Eometh is one of the Rohirim.

Haldir will be great!

## 4 [Kiwina on June 27, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49130-guessing-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=491727)

 Haldir is an ally being released in the A Journey to Rhosgobel adventure pack.

## 5 [Glaurung on June 27, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49130-guessing-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=491732)

So Bilbo and Frodo coming in next 2 Packs. Than Boromir. So On the demo playing o sow Pictures Celeborn and Torin Oakshield. I thing they will be there too (I mean in the shadow of Mirkwood Circle).

## 6 [Kzer-za on June 27, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49130-guessing-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=491733)

Didn't they say Prince Imrahil was coming later in the Mirkwood cycle?

## 7 [felix16 on June 27, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49130-guessing-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=491734)

 Well, just so it´s said, Elrond is actually a half-elf. And as that is said, Arwen is probably a very likely candidate for at least ally status, if not hero.

## 8 [lleimmoen on June 27, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49130-guessing-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=491767)

I don't think they'll play the half-elven trait. It was afterall his choice to be elven. It is possible we'll see another newly created heroes, I wouldn't care much for another Rohan though as we have gotten three already. I really hope we'll get another Elf soon as there are only two so far. Perhaps Grimbeorn is going to be a Hero, that would be rather sweet.

Yes, the French site reported that he is the hero for Rhosgobel (Leadership)

## 10 [lleimmoen on June 28, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49130-guessing-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=492011)

Then Boromir will indeed be Tactics. But what happens in the expansion 4? A Neutral Hero? Hardly that. I still hope for at least another Elf. Perhaps Lore will get one more?

Don't you have a link for that? A picture too?

Dadajef is the man over there, if you haven't been yet. He's one of the translators of the game into French so he has already seen many of the cards and he's quite generous with information usually.

My Heroes guess/hope is that we will see some weakish ones, and I am ok with it.  Anything to avoid a lot of power creep and keep the game challenging. Characters that are great thematically, but not super powerful. Characters that may help out a lot at some stage of a Nightmare session, but can be a definitely challenge to use for others.

I still want a Hobbit Scenario... :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] Killing Smaug is fun.

## 14 [Rubinon on October 4, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49130-guessing-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=536859)

Wouldn't Thranduil be the thematically fitting hero for the Return to Mirkwood AP? Then he could be a strong leadership hero!

## 15 [gatharion on October 4, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49130-guessing-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=536872)

 I'm guessing we get Balin as a dwarf Lore hero in Kazad Dum.

The only strange thing about that would be that since the premise for Khazad-Dum is initially to go check on Balin in the mines of Moria, since "no one has heard from him in years," it'd be a little odd if he accompanied your Fellowship to go see what he's up to.

## 17 [lleimmoen on October 4, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49130-guessing-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=536929)

I very much hope we will get Thranduil as a Leadership hero in Return to Mirkwood. It would be consistent for a number of reasons. First, he is the one ruling Woodland Realm, we have already got his son Legolas who is Tactics, Gimli is also Tactics and his father Gloin is Leadership.

I really hope Thranduil is something like this:

Threat Cost 10

Willpower 3

Attack 2

Defense 1

Hit points 4

Noble. Silvan.

Ranged.

Response: When an enemy is destroyed, ready Thranduil. (Limit once per round.)

## 18 [Dam the Man on October 4, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49130-guessing-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=536938)

I want a decent Spirit Hero (non-hobbit) to replace Dunhere whose ability is just absolutely going to waste in multiplayer games. He gets maybe one or two attacks during the first two turns, after that all Enemies pretty much auto-engage the other party (three decks start with 29 threat, Dunhere's deck with 25).

## 19 [ClydeCloggie on October 4, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49130-guessing-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=536947)

Given the premise of Khazad, we can pretty much rule out Balin as a Hero, and any of the other Dwarves from the Hobbit that went with him into Khazad-Dum.

No doubt Nain will be one of the two new Dwarf heroes, and hopefully FFG will then use the source material for the second one. Dain, the King Under The Mountain, comes to mind.  Just out of curiosity I'd like to see Bombur just to find out how FFG would handle the fact he's so fat now he can't walk  anymore.

 

## 20 [lleimmoen on October 5, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49130-guessing-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=537264)

I was thinking (based on what I heard) Celeborn would be coming as a Spirit hero. I liked the idea. But now it looks really more like Thranduil as a Leadership, I hope. Then two dwarves, and I like the idea of them being Spirit and Lore. I enjoy non-Tactics dwarf theme. And then hopefully some more elves as there are so many to choose from. And we need them!

## 21 [Mighty Jim 83 on October 5, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49130-guessing-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=537272)

So to re-cap, thus far we've got (upto and including Dead Marshes)

3 Dwarves - 2 Tactics,  1 leadership - 2 heroes coming in Khazad Dum, as people have said, 1 Spirit, 1 Lore seems logical.

2 Hobbits - 1 Spirit, 1 Lore

2 Elves - 1 Tactics, 1 Lore

10 Human:

2 Dunedain - 1 Leadership, 1 Lore

4 Gondor - 1 Spirit, 1 Leadership, 1 Tactics, 1 Lore

3 Rohan - 1 LEadership, 2 Spirit

1 Dale

 

Given that we've covered all the Hobbits likely to have strayed outside the Shire at this point, Elves definitely seem to be the under-represented group (obviously it depends a bit on whether you want to group all the humans together, or take each set separately.) More Dunedain at some point would seem like a good thing to have, but for now, Elves look like the way forward- and so many to choose: Thranduil, Celeborn, Galadriel (I expect not, probably an Ally, Gandalf-style) Elrond, Elladan, Elrohir are the first few that leap to mind.

Middle Earth Quest players - are there other heroes from there who we've not seen yet? (I understand that's where Thalin, Eleanor and Beravor come from) i expect we'll see them in the not too distant future.

## 22 [Dam the Man on October 5, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49130-guessing-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=537280)

There's Argalad, Elf, starts at Woodland Realm, so one of Thranduil's people. Should have Ranged (his deck in MEQ is 80% Ranged, 20% Melee combat cards) at least. Are there any Ranged Spirit characters?

And then Eometh, from Rohan, rider and all that. Eometh as Rohan Tactics Hero?

## 23 [lleimmoen on October 5, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49130-guessing-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=537306)

I would keep the division. Not only for Men but also Elves.

Thus we have got:

1 Noldor (Lore)

1 Silvan (Tactics)

2 Dunedain (Leadership, Lore)

4 Gondor (Tactics, Leadership, Spirit, Lore)

3 Rohan (Leadership, 2 Spirit)

1 Dale (Tactics)

2 Hobbit (Spirit, Lore)

3 Dwarf (2 Tactics, Leadership)

Including Khazad-dum we shall have seen 5 Dwarf heroes, quite enough for a deck. I hope the tally of other nations/races will get to that number or so. The biggest problem may be Hobbits but perhaps the designers hall take legacy to include the likes of Peregrin Took or they will make up their own. As for making up characters, I am not against it, and it has been very fortunate with the likes of Henamarth Riversong; however, where there is plenty I do not think we need more, thus I'd much rather see Thranduil, Celeborn, Elladan, Elrohir, etc. than a made-up elf. Same goes for Rohan, there quite a few names to choose from. Dunedain could gain Halbarad. Dale may have a problem, so I would not mind an original character coming off of that area.

I might have posted this earlier in the thread, but I think Samwise Gamgee could be a fitting Hobbit hero.  Frodo wouldn't have made it to Mount Doom without Sam.

## 25 [Rubinon on October 6, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49130-guessing-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=537755)

The problem with Sam is the timeframe. The quests of the game are supposed to tale place in the time period between the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings. At this time, Sam was only a gardener, while Bilbo and Frodo were travelling abroad (though, in Frodo's case, it's a stretch).

## 26 [Kiwina on October 6, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49130-guessing-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=537761)

Sam is no more a stretch than Frodo, other than the fact that he was perfectly happy in the shire.  I'm pretty sure Frodo stayed in the Shire during the 17 years between Bilbo's 111th birthday and Frodo's departure for Bree.

## 27 [Mighty Jim 83 on October 6, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49130-guessing-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=537764)

Well from the Dwarrowdelf preview, we now know that we've got Erestor coming in the next cycle. Possibly Arwen too someone seemed to think (although unsure whether as ally or hero)

I wonder if extra Elves at the start of the next cycle means fewer now?

Erestor will be an ally. So far we've only seen the picture of Arwen. I personally would like to see her as a hero (tough not consistent with Tolkien I think). Even a special event would be nice.

## 29 [lleimmoen on October 6, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49130-guessing-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=537800)

I am guessing Arwen as a hero, Elrond as an ally. And have you heard that Glorfindel might be showing up again as either Tactics or Spirit? That is very exciting and I hope he shows up in this cycle already as it mentions Rivendell!

To quote "The Shadow of the Past": "Frodo went tramping all over the Shire with them, but more often he wandered by himself, and to the amazement of sensible folk he was sometimes seen far from home walking in the hills and woods under the starlight. Merry and Pippin suspected that he visited Elves at times, as BIlbo had done."

I think that's were the designers took the idea from to make a "Frodo" hero.

## 31 [Eryx_UK on October 6, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49130-guessing-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=537828)

The thing to remember is that this game, like any card game based on a license, is a "what if?" scenario.  Just because we know Sam was a gardener at this point in time doesn't mean we shouldn't get him as Hero card.
