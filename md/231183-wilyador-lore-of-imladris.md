Hi there. We just bought this pack since we're a little late to the LotR party and hit a little rules snag with Wilyador. If Wilyador has more than 5 damage upon it and Lore of Imladris is played, can the event be resolved? Here's my reasoning:

 

Let's say that Wilyador has 6 damage. Lore of Imladris is played, healing 6 damage from Wilyador. However, Wilyador's text states "Wilyador cannot be healed of more than 5 wounds by a single effect", which invalidates the Lore of Imladris thereby preventing it from being able to be played. I thought that maybe the event would just heal 5 damage off Wilyador instead, but since it states "all" damage, 5 would not satisfy the event's text, thereby preventing it from being able to resolve.

 

 

 

Am I right in my line of thinking, or can the event just be used to heal 5 damage? Thanks!

My guess would be that Wilyador is supposed to heal 5 from Lore of Imladris, but at the same time your logic is sound and if I were playing a game with someone who made that argument I would be inclined to accept their idea.

I'm not completely certain -- I will never remember the distinctions between "all" and "each" and whatever in this game -- but I would think the partial fulfillment ruling would apply here:

i.e., you can heal 5.

Google search found plenty who play it as healing for five, none who thought it wouldn't work it all.  For example, in Beorn's Path:

"With Wilyador limited to being healed five damage from each Athelas or Lore of Imaldris..."

 

Note that the Athelas objective doesn't specify any particular level of healing, it's stage 3B that makes it 5 each.  The player card Athelas heals "all damage on a character", so I presume the Athelas objective would be capable of the same thing, were it not for the scenario-imposed limit.

I thought of this last night as well as I was playing this scenario but just ruled that it must be the 5 damage. But it is still a grey area I think.

 

Edit: So I messed around with a different hero/deck build for this encounter to make it more challenging and I am wondering, are there any other methods to heal Wilyador with the cards provided up until this expansion? Can Glorfindel heal the character or does he have to be discarded after you use it?

Glorfindel Lore Hero would be discarded if he heal Wilyador.

> Glorfindel Lore Hero would be discarded if he heal Wilyador.

What?

It's a result of 2b's forced effect: Forced: After a card effect heals Wilyador, remove that card from the game.

 

However, if you manage to get Rhosgobel out of the staging area during stage one (or blank its text), you can use Glorfindel to heal during stage one without discarding him.

I believe it's just 5 damage because cannot is absolute.

I should correct my earlier statement -- if LoGlorfindel is removed by stage 2b's forced effect, he wouldn't be "discarded", he would be removed from the game.  I'll grant it's unlikely that a player would use LoGlorfindel to get one point of healing, then use "Fortune or Fate" or "Houses of Healing" to bring him back for another point of healing, but that's not an option in this case.
