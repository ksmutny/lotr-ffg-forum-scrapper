Over the summer, I started working on a new project building an interactive atlas of locations for our beloved card game.  As a lover of maps, I learned a lot building this and hope you will enjoy browsing it, reading my introductions, and seeing the locations laid out on the map of Middle-earth.

 

So far, I've only finished the core set and first two cycles, but hope to keep plugging away over the course of the year.  I'm not a web designer, but have found the free services of GoogleSites [https://sites.google.com/]and ThingLink [https://www.thinglink.com/] sufficient to my goals so far.  Go check it out and see what you think!

 

Browse through Master of Lore's LOTR LCG Atlas [https://sites.google.com/site/thelotrlcgatlas/].  Use links at the bottom of each page to advance in release order through the maps.

 

Glimpse my Steward's Fear map [https://www.thinglink.com/scene/549575460619550722] (with locations, allies, and more).
