I want to ask to people if the english text is correct. How about? Thanks

It sounds better as: When Revealed: Each hero must pay 1 resource or it is exhausted. Then, remove 1 progress token from the current quest for each exhausted character in play.

 

Hope this is right. English is not my first language.

Mmmmh, the question is that in this scenario, heroes can have got progress tokens (when they kill one enemy). In fact players win the game when each hero has 2 progress tokens on them.

How about this?:

 

When Revealed: Each hero must remove 1 progress token or it is exhausted. Then, remove 1 progress token from the current quest for each exhausted character in play.

If you want to remove progress specifically from the quest card and not the active location (if there are any tokens there), then you need to say "quest card" instead of just "quest". Also, I'd re-word the first sentence:

When Revealed: Discard 1 progress token from each hero in play. Each hero may be exhausted instead of removing a progress token from it. Then, remove 1 progress token from the current quest card for each exhausted character in play.

I think that's the clearest and most grammatically correct way I can think of.

This is my actual version after the latest posts:

 

e2o9.jpg [http://img843.imageshack.us/img843/1453/e2o9.jpg]

 

The idea is like:

 

ffg_old-wives-tales-thfg.jpg [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/ffg_old-wives-tales-thfg.jpg]

with the text:

When Revealed: Discard 1 resource from each hero's resource pool, if able. Exhaust any hero that could not discard a resource from its pool.
 

 

or...

 

ffg_men-in-the-dark-tdf.jpg [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/ffg_men-in-the-dark-tdf.jpg]

with the text:

When Revealed: Each hero must pay 1 resource or take 1 damage. If no hero takes damage from this effect, Men in the Dark gains surge.

 

And this last is newer than first, so text is more thinked by developers.

 

This is the reason why i have written: "...1 progress token from him or be exhausted". More simple than first card.

 

 

But "Rising Storm" is about progress tokens, so you can't say: "pay X progress tokens", but also not "discard" i think. So i copy the text of the next location of Rivendel, with the next text:

 

ffg_pathless-country-rtr.jpg [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/ffg_pathless-country-rtr.jpg]

Forced: After at least 1 progress token is placed on Pathless Country, remove 1 progress token from it.

 

So finally, i wrote: "Each hero must remove 1 progress token from him..."

 

I think this is the better option.

 

Isn't? :rolleyes: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_rolleyes.gif]

Yea, the only problem I have is trying to determine if I have the choice to exhaust a hero even if they have a progress token on them, or if that is just what happens when the hero doesnt have any token on him.

That question is here [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/94400-the-druadan-forest-men-in-the-dark/].

 

I have tested the game in 4 players and this treachery is too hard. I must do it more soft.

 

I'm thinking about:

 

"Each player must remove 2 progress tokens from 1 hero he controls or exhaust 1 hero. Then, remove 1 progress token from the current quest car for each exhausted hero in play."

The fact that there is a thread where people keep saying they don't understand if it is a choice or not proves the wording is unclear that way and should likely be worded in a different way. Also, I like the new version's effect better. I figured the previous revision was supposed to be really killer, but yea, this is a bit less ridiculously powerful.

Ok nice. It is finished then. :wub: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wub.png]

 

I really like to play this scenario, very funny.

 

 

PD: BUT!!!, yesterday i played with 3 players, 2 times. We lost both times. Really dificult. Maybe we had badluck. I want to test other times..., if the dificult continues i should change any text cards :huh: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_huh.png] .

PD: In 1 or 2 players is not too dificult. (But it must be played with dedicated decks)

 

What do you think?
