Scenario: Cirdan the Shipwright has Light of Valinor and Narya attached. I commit characters to the quest, including Cirdan (who does not exhaust), Spirit Legolas, and two allies. Since in the rulebook it says I can take actions at any time during this event, could I exhaust Cirdan to ready the two allies I committed to the quest, THEN trigger Legolas's response and ready Cirdan, or would it be too late?

Nice idea, but it doesn't quite work.

Narya uses an Action, but Legolas's ability is a Response to questing.

So, after you perform the framework action of committing characters you have to resolve any Forced/Response effects that trigger off that before a new action can be commenced. So, if you wait until Narya's Action, you have missed the Response window for the commit and Legolas can't trigger.

But, questing is a green box, and this might work if Cirdan and Legolas are owned by different players. It doesn't say you can take actions between different players committing.  Player 1 could commit Cirdan, and then use Narya, the Player 2 could commit Legolas and trigger his ability on the now exhausted Cirdan.

Ah I see, I just read the FAQ entry that talks about simultaneous committing of characters to the quest. Thanks. So to truly complete the combo, I'd need to play a Late Adventurer, right?

Oh wait, never mind. Just realized that Late Adventurer requires you to exhaust the hero. Oh well. Thanks for the clarification!

Better Setup .. attach Light of Valinor to Legolas, so Legolas can ready Cirdan and is ready during questing

Oh yeah! That would work quite nicely.
