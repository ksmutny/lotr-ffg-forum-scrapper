Hi all,

I know it is a question that is frequently asked in the community: "What scenarios should I play to get my friends into the game?"

Well, question no more, I just made a list with 10+ quests that are great to use for new players, whether they are looking for action, theme, or just a good time. The list was created with the help of the community via a survey, so if you filled in the survey, you have my thanks! The article also has some handy tips you can use to further convince new players to get into the game, and how to play with them. You can find the list here: https://visionofthepalantir.com/2018/09/07/new-player-quests/ [https://visionofthepalantir.com/2018/09/07/new-player-quests/]

I hope that this helps a lot more players join the game, feel free to share your success stories below.Â 

Cheers,
