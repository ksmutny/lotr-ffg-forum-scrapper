# [Nazgul and shadow effects](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47296-nazgul-and-shadow-effects/)

## 1 [Ismar on May 24, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47296-nazgul-and-shadow-effects/?do=findComment&comment=474083)

Finally played scenario 3 last night, and this question came up.

The text on the Nazgul card states that "after the shadow effect resolves" (not shadow card), the engaged player removes 1 character.

Now there are 3 ways we interpreted this.

1. Since the card states shadow effect, if the nazgul receives a shadow card with no effect, his forced ability does not activate (no effect to resolve)

2. Shadows cards with no shadow effect still resolve (with no effect), so his forced ability does activate

3. It's a typo, and should read "after the shadow card resolves", which give the same result as #2 above.

We went with the #1, since a shadow card with no shadow effect never resolves.  To us it seemed the most literal interpretation.

How have others played this?

I searched the forums, but couldn't find an answer.

Thanks,

Don

I vote #1.  I believe that the designer specifically used the wording "after a shadow effect resolves" to mean that the ability is only triggered by a shadow card with a shadow effect.  That is to say, if you were to reveal a location or something as his shadow card, his ability would not trigger.  However, if you do reveal a card with any shadow effect whatsoever, you would have to choose and discard 1 character.

Here's another thought though, to test my own assumption.  Let's say that Nazgul of Dol Guldur attacks, and I delare an Ally and exhaust it to defend against the attack.  If his ability is triggered and I choose to discard that Ally, would I then have to assign damage to a Hero as an undefended attack?  I assume I would...

yes and yes...

you can compare the "warg" card to this phenomenon - only if a shadow effect resolves - and nothing resolves if there is no shadow effect at all, such as locations - does his ability trigger... same with the wargs - either they remain engaged, or they return to the staging area...

How about you Feint Nazgul, he still gets a shadow card and it has an effect, what do you do then? I'd say nothing...

At work so can't check the rules, but isn't the Shadow card only revealed if/when said Enemy attacks? Engaged Nazgul has a Shadow card and it might even have a shadow effect but it never gets resolved if it doesn't attack.

Correct. Dealing a shadowcard happens allways, but resolving one is part of an attack and can be cencelled.
