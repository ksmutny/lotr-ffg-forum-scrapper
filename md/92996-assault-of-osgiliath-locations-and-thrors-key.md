If I attach Thror's Key to The Old Bride, West Gate or another location That I cannot normal travel - after I can normal travel to this location?

Yes, you can attach Thror's Key to these locations, but onlly when they are revealed in the quest phase. So the locations added by setup can't be attached by Thror's Key.

great  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] so I think that same Thror's map - so with Thror's Key and Thror's map I maybe beat this scenario on 4 players  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
