## 1 [richsabre on August 9, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/68833-player-play-amount-poll/?do=findComment&comment=671100)

i have decided to do another couple of polls - the first one is simply whether you play 1/2/3/4 player and the 2nd is how much you play

firstly though thank you for all taking part in my last poll….the thread is buried ---EDIT- few more people have voted so im updating the results--- so here were the results (explanation of what the letters stand for are in this thread - http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=691868 [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=691868])

A -10

B- 5

C - 6

D -9

E-6

F- 1

Theme players just nipped it so its nice to see we have alot of theme players among us

 

so here is the new 2 polls….first one is which one describes you most……

A Exclusively Solo player
B Exclusively 2 players
C Exclusively 3-4 players
D Both 1 and 2 player, though mainly Solo
E Both 1 and 2 player, though mainly 2 playes
F Equal mixture of 1-4 players

G Equal mixture of Solo and 2 player

H Mixture of Multiplayer (excluding solo)

 

if you play solo with two decks then ill leave it up to you which catagory you think that comes under!

 

and the second one is on average how often do you play?

A At least once per day
B 3-6 times per week
C 1-2 times per week
D 1-3 times per month
E Less than once per month
 

please give both letters in your answer in the order above- results will be updated as i get them. Thanks!

thank you both, and you are welcome John

@plueschi- ive made a new catagory for 50/50 solo/2 player so ill put you as that

## 9 [monkeyrama on August 9, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/68833-player-play-amount-poll/?do=findComment&comment=671119)

1) D

2) C

 The C for the second category is rather generous, I sometimes fall into the D grouping, depending on how things are going.

You might get back to 6 answers when "only" asking about solo- or mulitplayer, like 

D) solo or multi - mainly solo

E) solo or multi - mainly multi

and then fuse F) and G) to

F) equal solo and multi

 

Not sure if you want to go that way though.

## 18 [Trantor3 on August 9, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/68833-player-play-amount-poll/?do=findComment&comment=671166)

1) B

Ok, this is not exactly true. I sometimes play 3 or 4 player, and have played a handful of solo games as well. But over 90% of my games are just me and my girlfriend, so B fits best I'd say.

 

2) D

(used to be B, but the novelty has weared off)

if you play solo with two decks then ill leave it up to you which catagory you think that comes under!

 

 D/F… ??  I play mainly solo, with occassional 3/4 players in.  That wasn't really an option, so maybe D is the closest?  Perhaps "Mainly solo, with 2-4 player occasionally" would've been a solid option to include somewhere in there.

Up until recently, it would've been B.  But work/family has been busy lately, so pretty sever drop off to closer to D.  Sad, but true… so if I average it, probably have to go with "C" lately.

## 28 [GhostWolf69 on August 10, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/68833-player-play-amount-poll/?do=findComment&comment=671472)

Arrrrgh!

I can't find mine….

I never play Solo.

I mostly play 2…. sometimes 3 and more rarely 4 players.

I think the closest I get is "Exclusively 2" but that is not true…

Discounting the rare 4 player session I'd say the split between 2 and 3 players are 3-1.

I'd need an Option that says "Exclusively 2-3 players".

Oh well….

How often? 1-2 per Week on average.

Well for me on the first question can we add a Never play solo option because I play mostly 2-3 player games however we do 4 player games at my LGS.

As for the second question, it used to be 2 a week but now it is more 3-6 times a month so put me down for D.

H - I mainly play with a friend of mine and sometimes others join us for 3- or 4-player games. I never really tried playing solo and I started playing when the Core Set was released.

C - We try to meet at least once a week to play, but it varies from 2 times per month to once a week.

1-e

2-c 

2 player is so much better in my opinion.  Social interaction and brain storming is fun.  And when my partner says I've just made a new deck, it gives me a reason to make a new deck myself, but with a new goal in mind for how to make it.

It seems like this game was designed for two player so it's awesome when your wife loves the game as much or more than you do!

thanks ill add that in

the whether this was designed for two player is a topic ive argued to death (against of course happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]) im not going to sidetrack the topic here doing so, but it is interesting that if the game is indeed designed for two players, we have so many purely solo players.

i think its obvious that with cards such as elrond and glorfindel, and the inclusion of bilbo as a 4th hero, not a standard one, that the designers are taking solo very seriously

either way thanks for voting
