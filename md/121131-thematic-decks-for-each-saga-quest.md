Let's suppose you were going to play the lotr sagas and you're super thematic, what decks would be possible to build  (only heroes) so that it fits???

For 2-player games:

 

We played through each of the Black Riders quests with Glorfindel (Spirit), Merry, and Fatty on one side, with Aragorn (Lore), Pippin (Lore), and Sam on the other.  Obviously Glorfindel and Aragorn shouldn't be there right from the start, but if you're going to do campaign mode you have to stick to a set of heroes for all 3 quests (and beyond that once The Road Darkens is released).  If you want to be super thematic, you'd have to do fewer than 3 heroes per player for the first two quests, unless you are playing solo.  The decks we used contained a lot of the Hobbit-themed player cards, and were very fun to play.

 

We played through box of the Hobbit saga boxes as well with thematic decks, using Oin, Ori, and Bombur on one side, with Thorin, Balin, and Nori on the other.  This was actually a very fun experience.  Dwarf decks are still strong, but a lot less powerful without Dain in play, and it made the Hobbit quests a lot more challenging.  The Battle of Five Armies in particular was pretty brutal.  Also got to dust off some cards like Untroubled by Darkness and get good, regular use out of them.

lol - We used her to represent some un-named elf who helped the hobbits out on their way to Rivendell. Perhaps one of Gildors elves or someone from Rivendell.
