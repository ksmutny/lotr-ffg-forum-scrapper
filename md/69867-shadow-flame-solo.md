# [Shadow &amp; Flame (solo)](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69867-shadow-flame-solo/)

I have attempted the Shadow and Flame AP nearly two dozen times. Not ONCE have I been able to pull out a win. Has  anyone else been able to defeat this quest while playing solo (not double fist, but pure solo), and if you have been able to beat it, how did you go about doing it? What cards did you use?

The most effective strategy is Eagle deck with Hama, Elrond and Bilbo. Try to play feint every turn to stop Balrog, cycle feint with Hama, Bilbo help you to draw card for feint-discard and same time build up army of eagles to kill the Balrog. This strategy work very well, you will win almost every time.

 I've played it 3 times now solo, with two different decks, and won once with my primary deck (on its second go). That deck runs Aragorn, Beravor, and Frodo, so I have Frodo's ability to save my bacon on the turns that I can't play one of the decks many allies. Typically, you need to spit out an ally every turn against this quest, so that will almost certainly mandate that you get ahead of the card draw (more than 1 per turn), unless your **entire** deck is allies. Of course, if your entire deck is allies, you won't get ahead of the questing and monster killing (since you'll lose an ally every turn), so draw is rather critical.

A Test of Will is vital in this quest (as in most), and try to always, always, always cancel Counterspell.

Good luck!

I've only played it once, I don't like to "spoil" a quest so I didn't know what was coming ….. I played my Gloin deck and got a win.

Heroes - Gloin, Bilbo and Glorfindel (S)

I quested successfully every turn finishing on 11 threat (I drew no threat reduction apart from Gandalf on the last turn which I used for direct damage).

The key was Bilbo allowing me to outdraw the encounter deck, playing a chump blocker on turns 2, 3, 4 and 5. After that I managed to get a Citadel Plate on Gloin (using Narvi's belt) and then was able to block with him, using Healing herbs and a Daughter of nimrodel to keep Gloin alive.

I was using Henemrath and Rumors to control the encounter deck, always questing with just enough to break even or make progress. I didn't see a test of will but got lucky that the only attachment that ended up on the Balrog was Counterspell.

On the last turn I played Gandalf and Imladris Startgazer allowing me to stack the deck ready for the push down the pit.

I got a bit lucky in places but not excessively so. It was an epic fight.

I made a video playing against SaF. And while I made plenty mistakes, I think that a legal win would have been possible. You can find the video here:

In my opinion this quest is really big disappointed. Specially after amazing FOS!!! this is first quest difficult 8 + we meet Balrog himself but…… really boring and annoying quest in my opinion. In my opinion second cycle have only 3 really cool quest RHG, FOS and TLD. all others is really low quality.

Hope Hobbit and Smaug will be cool!

Yes, Háma and Feint is good. But only until you come across Counter-spell.

Counter spell is quite easy to manage. Only dangerous in early beginning. But this is really bad luck.

Actually if DB have 2 counter spell on him they work together and he will lose both in the case of trigger. Anyway i dont scare counter spell.

Like I already said: Using two core sets and complaining that the game is boring at the same time is ridiculous!

Also, I think your strategy works only in less than half of the games which makes a rather poor record. I think the only disappointing scenario was TLD. The rest was good too awesome.

My best strategy so far was Boromir/Elrond/Dáin with tons of attachments (Chain Mail, Dunedain Warning, Burning Brand, Narvi's Belt) and healers. I had mostly dwarfs in that deck so Erebor Battle Master could take care of the Balrog. My win ratio was over 60 percent.

My recent deck is Boromir/Elrond/Théodred and uses "Support of the Eagles" and "Eagles of the Misty Mountains to defend against the Balrog. Have to say that Elrond finally makes tactics decks working.

No, he actually won't. Each copy of Counter-spell creates a separate forced effect, and those effects are resolved individually (in the order of the first player's choosing, although that doesn't really matter since both effects are identical). You can't reveal one card to satisfy both forced triggers.

So, say there are two copies attached to DB when you play an event. You resolve the first, discarding the top encounter card. If it is a treachery, the nasty stuff happens (cancel, hand discard), and then THAT copy of Counter-spell is discarded. If a non-treachery is discarded, nothing happens, but you repeat the process for the second copy. DB won't lose both if a single treachery is discarded.

Glaurung !!! Sometimes I don't get your thought process.

Just because you designed a specific deck that works well against a quest  doesn't make the quest itself a disappointment.  Nor are you forced to use that deck in the future.  Try another deck!  

 

As an example I have never designed a specific deck against an adventure, that seems cheesy to me. I design stuff to be either thematic or to support a certain card synergy (like the Elrond deck I am currently using which is kick ass)

Yeah. Why not make a more thematic and less specific deck, Háma Elrond Bilbo sounds a bit pushy in terms of the theme, and I guess it doesn't work that well against some more willpower-demanding quests.

Also, I don't see how Counter-Spell is not a problem. There is little chance to prevent it - no Denethor, Risk Some Light too costly without secrecy, Out of the Wild also… or cancel it--the chance is it will come before you have both Vilya and A Test. Once Counter-spell is there, the whole Feint strategy goes up the chimney, together with your hand probably. Further, if you don't draw Feint (over 40 percent chance) you have to face Balrog round 1 almost guaranteed (with this low questing deck). Of course you can feed him allies--for some time.

## 16 [Glaurung on August 26, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69867-shadow-flame-solo/?do=findComment&comment=682214)

About counter spell. I think sStarhawk is right and if DB have 2 of them you discard only one. He have very good logic about and this make game more difficult what i always welcome. But is doesn change much anyway. Cose you can look on the top card by Denethor and anyway get feint back with Hama later in the case of losing your hands.

Problem of this quest not easy or hard. This quest is annoying!!! Suppose to be epic battle with Balrog but on the practice is very boring. MAO much more interesting for example. If you compare Balrog from Decipher game or MECCG and even from Flight from Moria this one is worse idea in my opinion. Anayway is my though and i just tell what i feel about it.

About 2 core set or 2 core set . I use the rules : no more then 3 copies of the same card in the deck and minimum 50 cards. So nothing wrong with that right?

 

P.S> just make a proxy of Lake-town and will play tonight with my friend couple of 2 players sessions. Let you know after.

By the way there is all  cards of this quest on Cardgame DB.

Playing it solo, Shadow and Flame is probaly just a random scenario.

It starts getting interesting when you play it multiplayer and have to figure out a way to block every attack the Balrog is dealing.

 

If you have a hard time defeating this quest, think about Secrecy cards. Since you go to 0 threat at the beginning of the quest, every deck is elligible to play them.

My point is this. I think it is certainly not that hard to create a deck that will deal with the quest. Especially for the above given reasons: all secrecy cards will be available for most of the game on most of the games; however, if you don't build a deck specificaly for this quest, it will be challenging.

Boring or fun is another aspect. I too have found quite a few other quests more entertaining.

This scenario brutally killed me in something like turn two yesterday, my dwarfy deck that has braved the depths of Moria for most of the cycle was finally defeated. I think this definitely needs a deck built specifically to combat it, and probably will require sacrificing a lot of theme (something I dislike intensely). But so be it! 

On a somewhat-related note, does the spirit event O Elbereth! Gilthonial! work on Durin's Bane? I can't think if I've seen this mentioned here, but the card text on the balrog, about it not leaving the staging area, has me concerned that perhaps it won't. 

## 20 [Emrad on August 26, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69867-shadow-flame-solo/?do=findComment&comment=682326)

 I lived quite the opposite situation yesterday: the encounter could have surrended turn 2 :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

On turn 2, we had an Elrhohir with Steward of Gondor, a +1 Dunedain Def bonus, and Arwen. So the player controling Elrhohir could block for both player, taking only 2 damage per turn. A healer took care of those wounds soon enough.

The whole point of Durin's Bane is to remain in the staging area for the whole quest, so indeed, it cannot be moved to the bottom of the encounter deck by O Elbereth! Gilthonial!

Yes, this scenario needs a special line up. One of the things I like about this quest is that it allows you to play secrecy cards and that the starting threat of your heroes doesn't matter, which allows you to create combos you otherwise would never use.

 

As to your question, there has been some discussion (I think it should be in the rule question section), but no definite solution yet. My approach is to ignore OEG in this scenario, because you don't only remove Durin' Bane with it, but all the fun too.

 You don't need an approach, it can't leave the staging area.

And therein lies the problem. If it can't leave the staging area, it can't be discarded by Dark Pit…and there's no way to win the scenario. It almost certainly SHOULD be vulnerable to Dark Pit, but a strict reading of card text would disallow that interaction.

Although I sometimes react strongly to the way you present your ideas on the forum here (as seems to be the case with at least a few other people… lol), I have to agree with this sentiment 100%. 

Additionally, I've never understood the whole "number of core sets" debate.  I do play within the 3-of-each-card-limit (have 2 core sets myself, so only 2 copies of Henamarth, etc…), although since this game has no competitive format, I find the whole "tournament-legal" deck idea humorous…  If someone wants to make the game harder by limiting themselves, so be it.  But it comes off as ******-baggery to imply others are lesser players for not doing the same…

It's a bit silly, but it tends to come up because new players frequently wonder how many copies of the Core Set they should buy. For whatever reason, I see way too many posts on various forums that say something like, "It seems like I need three Core Sets--is this really the case?" For my part, I just try to point out that extra Cores are a luxury and not a necessity. Players should feel free to expand their deckbuilding options, but they are also able to have a satisfying game experience--and defeat any scenario--without buying the same product three times. I feel that's an important point of emphasis..

Speaking anecdotally, there's next to no correlation between number of Core Sets owned and player skill; I know some great players who use three and some similarly excellent gamers who get by just fine with one. You're absolutely right that there's no reason to belittle a player for using three copies of Core cards (since, after all, that's perfectly acceptable according to the rules). I do think it's often more interesting to play with just one Core (as it forces you to be slightly more creative), but it's not inherently better or worse than including full playsets. Do whatever makes the game fun for you.

Lastly, my sig is meant in jest (just in case the patent lunacy of the statement didn't make that clear. There is no link between masculinity and # of Core Sets).

I didn't say that folks should restrict themselves to one core et if they don't want to. However, I think it's ridiculous to first make the game easier for you by adding additional cards and afterwards yo start to complain that it's now too easy. I played with one of Glaurung's decks and I know why he thinks the game isn't difficult enough. Playing with one core set would certainly improve his game experience, but if he doesn't want to, it's his own fault. It's like playing Civ on Prince level when you are good enough to win on Emperor.

the game rules are the bars that set the restrictions. If you make a deck in the rules and you break the game it is THE GAMES fault.. not yours. It is completely ridiculous to say, if the game is to hard you should gimp your own deck building choices and not think so hard and just make lame decks.

Sleeves and proxies.  I'll buy a Core Set expansion kit if they ever make one (which I doubt), but I'll be damned if I'm buying another core set to get 3 copies of a card.  But I can use a color printer with the best of them and if I want three copies of a card in my deck then I'll make it so.

Until I built a dwarf deck for The Hobbit that included Nori I hadn't played with a Spirit hero in over a year.  I did that because I hated "Spirit's Silver Spoon".  Now that is a well beaten horse, but I didn't complain about the difficulty of the game or quests because I was artificially handicapping myself.  (I complained that the sphere's weren't - and aren't - well balanced.)  Similarly, if I choose to limit myself by only including one copy of a card when the rules allow three I shouldn't complain about it.

Hi Boored

 

I disagree.

 

The card pool is great enough now that with full freedom to design a deck specifically tailored towards a quest you will beat that quest pretty handily.  And in doing so I (personally) don't feel much joy.

 

To me the challenge is in designing robust decks that can take on a full story arc, I also try and do these somewhat thematically, but to each their own! Calling these decks 'lame' is rather insulting as I feel they have a greater strength than a one shot quest deck.

Boored is right of you use the rules and can build up some to mich powerful decks something wrong with balalnce of the game. But this game is not same as other PVP so here is different logic.

Anyway as you say cool deck can play against all quests not only the certain ones. So berofe SOF and Battle in Lake-town my Aragorn/Denethor/Glorifindel(FOS) can do it but now is terrible fall to this 2 last super quests. Os now i have a new deck Elrond/Hama/Glorifindel(FOS) with Vilya, Eagles, Cycling Feint and this deck sure can be Rule them all deck. But still need tuning!!!! Later share deck list.

To me the challenge is in designing robust decks that can take on a full story arc, I also try and do these somewhat thematically, but to each their own! Calling these decks 'lame' is rather insulting as I feel they have a greater strength than a one shot quest deck. 

 

 

 

I think that is what most deck builders do. As in building decks for entire cycles. The "one deck to rule them all" has been a goal of deck builders form day one. Though I think it is pretty hard to loose using Hama, that deck is pretty much the deck that can beat all quests. Personally I make decks for entire cycles.

If you wish to gimp yourself by making less powerful decks then that is cool.. more power to you.. people have been making "thematic" decks for as long as CCGs have been around, and they have always been weaker. It is ridiculous to say though that people who are following the rules should have to think less critically, creatively and produce weaker decks to balance the game for the designers.

 The Elrond Deck I posted in the Strategy section has been working REALLY well to do just that.

Yes your deck is pretty cool. But i think you will have problem in JTR cose you need heal the Eagle and Warden will heal only 2 wounds and then he will be removed from the game so Healing herbs better choice in my opinion.

Naw… With that deck it's really easy to stay on stage 1 and remove Rhosgobel via Asfaloth.  Heal Wiley with multiple Wardens (remember he can refresh by paying a Lore token) and then blitz through stage 2 in one turn after you dig up enough Athelas.

yes is possible but is slow down you beat no??? Score will be really high. But…….actually this is a problem of the Elrond deck: quite slowly. You win yes but with a high scores. My previous decks have a good score many under 70-60 but Elrond deck always more then 100.Anyway now quests also more and more difficult so is normal thing i suppose.

 Score for me is a binary thing.

 

1 or 0 baby !!  Wins and Losses

Me too as the scoring system is inherently flawed.

Try it!!! you will like it. Cose when you play for scores is change a lot and force you to risk as well. Before i try it i also though is not interesting but when i try it…….. is pretty cool and change game a lot. Then look quest log and you will see some interesting results there.
