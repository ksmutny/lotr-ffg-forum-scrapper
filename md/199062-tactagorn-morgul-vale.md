If I am playing Morgul Vale and I kill Murzag with Tactagorn, do I then get to engage Lord Alcaron as part of Aragorn's response? Because the quest card says when Murzag is destroyed advance to the next quest stage, so does this interrupt the response?

You can kill Murzag which causes the passive effect on the quest card to resolve which puts Lord Alcaron into play.  Then, your opportunity to trigger Tactics Aragorn's response is available.  So you could engage Lord Alcaron as well, giving you an opportunity to attack him.  Also, if you killed Lord Alcaron (with Tactics Aragorn) you could then proceed to engage the final enemy or any potential enemies that are revealed from the stage 3 quest card.

I would say yes. Advancing the quest is a passive effect which interrupts and supercedes everything. You could also trigger Mighty Prowess to place a point of damage on him since he shares the Captain trait with Murzag.

Haha great I've been using Tale of Tinuviel with Galadriel to ready Aragorn, with Rohan Warhorse attached to blast through Murzag and Alcaron, after first feinting Murzag. It's a devastating combo, and really neuters that quest.

Yup, the same can be done with Tactics Merry/Fast Hitch/Hour of Wrath.  It does neuter the quest a bit.

Was Aragorn already exhausted from questing? Because I don't think you need Rohan Warhorse for this.
