# [Deluxe Expansion Re-Print Boxes still the Same?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/255482-deluxe-expansion-re-print-boxes-still-the-same/)

I'm looking to buy Khazad Dum again, but wanted to ask if these recent reprints are still the two-piece box? I noticed the Adventure Packs have become the plastic clam shell. But after buying the Dunwich Legacy, I noticed the box was cheap, thin garbage of a box. Can someone confirm that they haven't started doing this with the LotR deluxe expansions??

I don't know about reprints, but the new deluxe expansions still use the same boxes they were using years ago.  The most recent one, Sands of Harad, had thick sturdy cardboard.

Interesting - the new Khazad Dum reprints have become the plastic clam shells? Is that what you are saying? Or did you just mean the new quests now come in those plastic shells?

The New quests come in plastic clam packs, which is fine by me. But I love the presentation of the Deluxe Expansions in their sturdy, two-piece boxes. New Arkham Horror LCGs, come in flimsy cardboard one-piece and are useless for any component storage. Just like the Warhammer Fantasy RPG 3e Expansions after the Core Box.

So far we have been spared Arkam's Horror.

The reprints of old APs do indeed come in the clamshells now.

The Expansions themselves so far have been immune to the change.

I hope that FFG don't take the same cost-cutting approach with LOTR LCG. If they switch to flimsy cardboard boxes in future then I vote that they rename "deluxe" expansions to "economy" expansions :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

non ecologic cheap expansions?

There's not much of "ecologic" in using plastic, sadly.

I'd be so sad if they quit using the sturdy boxes for the deluxe expansions.  I'm able to keep all the encounter cards, quest cards, and rules inserts for each cycle in their deluxe box and it's really convenient for storage.

Having watched Asmodee cut corners wherever possible I think it's inevitable.  (Doesn't mean I'll be happy about it.)

As someone who actually uses the boxes for stuff, I am totally fine with the change. The problem I have with the normal deluxe boxes is that the "canvased" surface is very delicate and will scrap off very easily, which makes it hard to convert the boxes into something else. The new boxes have regular semi-glossy texture which will not scrape off, and on top of that are thinner so it's easier to cut them up and do something with them.
