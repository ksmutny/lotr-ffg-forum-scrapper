So, I've just built my first eagles deck, consisting of Legolas, Thalin and Eowyn. I tried it out against Passage through Mirkwood expecting a fairly easy win. It had everything under control until the Hummerhorns showed up as a shadow card. It killed Thalin, Winged Guardian and Vassal of the Windlord outright. Since the Vassal was the defending character, that meant the King Spider's attack went undefended, which killed Eowyn. From there on, it was just a disaster. Needless to say, I lost.

Tried it again. And again, had everything pretty much under control. I was facing Ungoliant's Spawn and the Dol Guldur Orcs. I stopped the Spawn in it's tracks with Feint. But the darned Hummerhorns showed up again as a shadow card for the Orcs. It killed Eowyn. So, it was time for some emergency management. I returned Landroval to my hand to return Eowyn to the game. Then, I attached Landroval facedown to Eagles of the Misty Mountains. 

Next, I attacked the Spawn with Thalin, Eowyn and 2 Vassals of the Windlord dealing 7 damage to it. The Vassals go out of play and I attached them to the Eagles making it a powerhouse. Next turn, I attached Support of the Eagles to Thalin. In the combat phase, I used the Eagles with 5 defense to block the Spawn, then, I exhausted Support of the Eagles so that Thalin can swing with a pretty massive 7 attack. Down goes the Spawn and I won the scenario! No thanks to the Hummerhorns! Pretty fun, but also an eye opener, that shows that the old introductory quest still has a few tricks up it's sleeve. 

Anyway, I think that despite the support it has gotten, the eagle deck still needs more help. No eagle heroes and dependent on other spheres to quest, typical of tactics, I guess. I certainly hope that although the focus is going to be away from them in coming releases, we will still get more cards for them.

While Passage is indeed fairly easy, it has one pulling factor for me, variable 3B. I wish other quests had alternative paths. Maybe in KD you could get a 2B where you branch off down one of two or three optional tunnels and the rest of the adventure takes on a different flavor based on your choice (or random draw).

I heartily agree with Dam that the alternative ending in Passage Through Mirkwood is excellant.  For just 1 extra card, you effectively get 2 different Quests.  The catacombs under the mountains and other labyrinthine regions, would be a great opportunity to try this excellant idea out again.  Never really knowing if the way ahead is long but safe or short but deadly, makes planning ahead tricky.  Hurrah for versatile decks!  Of course, no-one wants short and safe or long and deadly.  Cheers!
