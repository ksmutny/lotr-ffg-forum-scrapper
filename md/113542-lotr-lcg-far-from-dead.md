Like last year, the lcg which was the focus of attention in this year's inflight report also was LOTR. So i think that it is safe to say that our beloved game is alive and (very) strong. What are your thoughts ?

Once again, the two existing LCG's which got specific attention in the In Flight Report were Netrunner and LotR. Conquest was also mentioned as a new product. Anyone who thinks that this game is waning is just not paying attention.

They probably do it on purpose - they wait for people to be gnashing their teeth and then throw them a bone.

What was funny to me sitting in the report was that when netrunner releases were announced I didn't really hear any excitement in the room. When the Announcement of an adventure with Nazgul's was mentioned there was some excited people, myself included!

That's because netrunner players are not so starved for updates as lotr lcg ones.

I think that they have a very strong game with LOTR (not a best seller but a really strong title) it is a licensed game that doesn't depend on the hype of a movie, series or something like this (i remember a game that died along with the hype of the LOTR movies  ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] ) and it is a card game that doesn't need tournaments, organized play or a huge and active community to live.

LotR is so unique compared to anything else out there. How many other card games can you solo? How many other card games have a campaign mode with a story arc? If more people could just be shown how this game works it would be much more popular. This is THE BEST card game ever. Look how popular sentinels of the multiverse is right now. Those are all people that need to see the game that sentinels wishes it could be.

I say that if it was displayed in TV or announcements it will increase hugely a lot the sell

I agree that LOTR is a much deeper game than Sentinels but i like it to very much. Last year i was between (to get) Sentinels and Pathfinder. After a game or two of Pathfinder i find it to be just a worst and simplified version of LOTR, Sentinels on the other hand it's a very different game, it is a simple thematic co op card game that focuses 100% in combat and requires 0 deck building.

So i think LOTR is the game Pathfinder wishes to be.

Lol what? Pathfinder is not simplified version of LotR, it's entirely different game in it's root and does not remotely wishes to be LotR. Pathfinder is a roleplaying game turning into card game advanture, as simple as that.

I play both LotR and Pathfinder. Both are good games with major differences. In LotR you build your complete deck and no dice. But with Pathfinder you have to aquire the cards as you go by playing the senarios. So there might be a card you really want but can't play it until you find it. Both frustrating and satisfying. And of course dice. I like the new Bain and treasure cards LotR has for the sagas. Kinda gives you the same feel of getting more experience.

Every year at GenCon, the CEO of FFG gives a review of the last year and a preview of the year to come. This presentation is called the In Flight Report.

For those of us that could not have participated in Gen-Con, I am wondering is there a way to watch the latest FFG In-flight Report? Or perhaps a printed version exists, or an overview?

Last year FFG posted a YouTube link to it either on their Facebook page or in their main "news" section but so far I haven't seen it
