That new card box set for arkham horror looks awesome, dividers and such to store the full campaign, maybe theyll make some of those for LotR?

Yeah it's a good time to be an Arkham fan.

Remember that the IP that they have more control over will always get more attention. L5R attention >>> AGOT attention, for instance.

I know LotR got a card box for one of the event kits, but that was years ago. It's a nice box too. (Glad we don't get those books though for LotR, locking 2 new mechanically different cards behind a book paywall never sat well with me). A box big enough to hold an entire cycle with nightmare would be useful for many players I assume. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

R.I.P. Arkhame.

I would actually love to get boxes that hold each specific deluxe + cycle + Nightmare. Might be a good place to introduce a "campaign mode" with boons + burdens for each cycle too.Â
