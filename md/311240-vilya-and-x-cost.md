Hi

Does anybody know what happens when Vilya pulls X cost card? Does it treat it as 0, or can you choose any number?

If you can choose any number, Gandalf’s search would let you choose order of cards in whole your deck, making the card quite good. But it doesn’t sound like it’s allowed…

If you play a card with X cost for no cost it's counted as 0.
