Thurindir [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Thurindir-RaH] has a Setup action that lets you search your deck for a Side Quest and add it to your hand.

It looks to me like you draw your initial hand of 6 cards and do your mulligan before doing the "quest setup" steps, but I'm not seeing anything in the Race Across Harad rules that clarifies the timing of Setup triggers on player cards. What do we think? Does Thurindir's ability also happen after the mulligan has taken place?

My understanding is that you have choice on the order of Setup triggers, but that unless otherwise indicated that they all run after the standard setup actions.

So, you make the choice after initial draw and mulligan.

I asked once about this in relation to Ho! Tom Bombadil! in campaign mode, and Caleb said it's added after your mulligan, so Thurindir should be the same.

Nah... before you do everything, just put aside the side quest you want during your startup, and then proceed with drawing your first hand.

That seems incorrect in my eyes because you still could end up drawing that side quest in your "normal" starting hand. Thurindir triggers after drawing your hand (and possible mulligan) and you can search your deck for another sidequest (if you still have one in there).

Yeah, I was thinking of a deck with only one sidequest. But you're right!  ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

even so, if you draw that sidequest in your initial hand, you end up with one less card in your opening hand

Well, if your pre-mulligan draw has the one side quest in your deck, try again. =)
