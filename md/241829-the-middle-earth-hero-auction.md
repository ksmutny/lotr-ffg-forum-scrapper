# [The Middle-earth Hero Auction!](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/241829-the-middle-earth-hero-auction/)

## 1 [Seastan on February 4, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/241829-the-middle-earth-hero-auction/?do=findComment&comment=2625733)

Here's how the game works.

1. Sign up by making a post to this thread. In a few days I will close signups.

2. I will then post a list of heros. The number of heroes in the list will equal the number of signed up players, times 3.

3. Then you make a post where you bid for 3 of the heroes**, by stating how much of a threat cost you are willing to pay to use that hero. This would override their actual starting threat when you use them to play. For example, I might make a post like this:

> Quote
> 
> Arwen (11)
> 
> Aragorn (Lore) (10)
> 
> Fatty Bolger (2)

5. I will be keeping track of the highest bid for each hero in the OP. Your bids must always exceed the current highest bid for the hero. If you get outbid on a hero by someone else, you can submit an even higher bid for that hero, or you can bid on a different hero.

6. At the end of bidding, you must take the heroes for which you are the high bidder, and build a deck with them. The starting threat of that deck will be the combined threat cost you bid for all your heroes. So I do not recommend bidding 20 threat each on Gandalf Elrond and Glorfindel :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]. You will then post your decklist here or make the deck on RingsDB and post the link. Remind readers in your post of the threat you bid for each hero.

7. I will unveil three quests. These will not be quests that require a tailored deck (like Rhosgobel), but they will vary in difficulty. The mode of play (Easy/Normal/Nightmare) is up to you.

8. Play through the three quests with your deck, and come back here to tell us how it went!

** If you wish to enter the contest as a two-handed player, you may make 6 bids.

As something of a proponent of under-rated/under-used heroes myself, I was considering this exact approach...

The bidding is now open! The list of heroes up for auction can be found in the original post [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/241829-the-middle-earth-hero-auction/].

You can still enter the contest if you missed the signup period! Just post a bid for 3 of the heroes. I will then add some more heroes to the list so that there is enough for everybody.

 

Sidenote: A careful eye will see that there aren't currently enough heroes to go around. This is done in anticipation of possible dropouts, because having a surplus of heroes can ruin this game, as you can nab up a bunch of heroes without bids for 1 threat. I will add more heroes if the bidding participation indicates that they are needed, so don't worry, everyone will still get the proper number of heroes.

In the interest in saving myself a lot of bookkeeping as people bid back and forth from 0-1-2-3-4... up to a reasonable value, I'm going to ask that from now on you make your minimum bid for a hero as 4 less than their actual threat value. I think we can all agree that pretty much any hero is still a steal at that much of a discount.

The OP has been updated to reflect the current bids. I went ahead and entered myself as a placeholder bid for each hero at 1 under their minimum bid.

 

Keep in mind that you must always beat the previous bid by at least 1. So if you are willing to spend 8 on a hero, but not 9, then bidding 7 can be dangerous :D.

## 37 [Seastan on February 11, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/241829-the-middle-earth-hero-auction/?do=findComment&comment=2636055)

As an aside, I think a modified version of this game could be really fun in a small group with instant communication, but wouldn't really work in a forum: You would basically shuffle up your whole set of heroes and reveal them 1 by 1, and have people make threat bids on the hero starting at the minimum until no one is willing to go higher, then reveal the next hero, and so on until everyone has enough. You could hold off on bidding until the last three heroes are revealed of course, but you end up risking being stuck with whatever heroes get turned up.

:D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] Yup! I'm okay with that--I have never built a 3 siblings deck, so I'd be okay with not getting a discount. Good excuse to try something new.

I'm not planning on keeping score. I'm doing this just to see if I can. I'm excited to try a deck of my choosing against a quest not of my choosing. What'll it be? Mount Gram? This might suck. Wastes? Bring it on.

Updated. There were a few bids that didn't go through because someone else had already bid an equal or higher value before I could update the spreadsheet.

More heroes have been added to the list, thanks to near 100% participation!

Well, a good auctioneer wouldn't close down an auction while people are still in a bidding war would he? :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png].  So I'm not sure exactly, maybe another week? But I will be sure to give a few days notice.

Or you can just pull a Calvadur and bid 16 for your heroes, and then check out of this thread for a while :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png].

Nice.  Yeah, you don't want to end it too early.

This is a very interesting exercise.  There is the fairly straightforward question of "how much am I willing to bid for hero X?"  But then you also have to ask "What happens if I win this hero but get outbid on the other two?"  I find myself pivoting my deck idea with every bid.

Are we allowed to drop our current bid on a hero we are leading in for one you have added?  Just curious....

No, you need to be outbid on a hero in order to make a new bid.

Updated.

Heroes that fail to receive a bid in the three days starting at the end of the day today (11:59 EST) and ending Feb 18 (11:59pm EST) will be considered to be won by the current bidder. 

Bidding on the contested heroes will continue on afterward. This is just intended to focus down the list and aid those who have won heroes in planning out their other bids. So if you want to lock in a hero, make a strong bid before this day ends!

A lot of the new bids between your last update and this update aren't shown in the table.

Edit: Also, are we going to have the final heroes revealed before heroes are solidified on Feb 18 11:59 PM?

Thanks for catching that. I posted an old version of the chart by mistake.

I can't guarantee that no one will jump into the contest later on, but yes the full hero list will be available. Though I might make the minimum bid more strict later in the game.

    No,just 1-handed.

Allow me to point out what Seastan said in the opening post:

"3. Then you make a post where you bid for 3 of the heroes**, by stating how much of a threat cost you are willing to pay to use that hero. This would override their actual starting threat when you use them to play. For example, I might make a post like this:

...

** If you wish to enter the contest as a two-handed player, you may make 6 bids."

 

Seastan can feel free to contradict me, but I don't think you're allowed to bid on more heroes than you intend to use.

Is it OK to decide to run 2-handed solo at this point? I've never done it, and this could be a good chance to try it out and see how it rolls.  It pains me to see so many Dwarves unloved.

Updated. A couple bids failed to go through, so check the chart.

I haven't forgotten about locking in the heroes without new bids. I am just travelling for a few days, and my internet access is limited to my phone, which I find difficult to use with spreadsheets. So the deadline on the first hero lockdown has been extended by a couple days.

I don't want to be too much of a sticker, but shouldn't Elladan be locked in too? I believe I bid on him at the same time as Elrohir.

Idraen should also be locked because I bit my Valour-Vote on her together with Mardi and Aragorn(LE) and was not outbid on any of these 3 since Feb15. If so I could start building that deck and try to get a partner deck going if I can get another 3 heroes. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I think there was an error in the bidding.  Didn't you bid 8 for Celeborn way back when (page 3)?  I think danpoage might have overlooked your bid and also bid 8.

Big update.

I've locked in some more heroes and raised the minimum bid on some unbid-for heroes.

I've posted a second chart showing what heroes each player has locked in. If you have all your heroes locked in, start building your deck, and post a link so I can add it to the chart. The quests have already been chosen, so I won't be picking them to counter the decks you build or anything. The quests I've chosen are ones that don't involve heavily tailored decks (i.e. no Masters Malice, no Sailing/Hide tests, no battle/siege, no captives, etc.). 

For those that still need heroes, I realize that there are not enough remaining to go around. But I am reluctant to add more given that there are still unbid-for heroes in the pool. I don't want to flood the pool with heroes that can be picked up without much competition, because I think it would be unfair to the other players. So from this point on, if I do release any new heroes, the minimum bid will be set so the best discount you'll be able to get is -1, and of course, you don't know which heroes I'll add. So it is probably in your best interest to get a bargain on the heroes still remaining.

I've locked in my heroes, but it is not reflected there.  (I figure you just ran out of time, so here you go)(can't find the table, but I made this up in Excel of course so it won't copy over 100%, but the data is accurate)

In relation to decks: I have some thoughts and have essentially created them on rings.db, but I'm not 100% on either of them at this point.  Is it OK to submit rough drafts?  I assume once we hit the ground running we'll still have the options to swap stuff out of a sideboard or something, right?  Or are we stuck with exactly what we provide to you as a deck list?

Thanks for all the organization for this!

Thanks, fixed.

The question about sideboards is a good one. I don't think you need one, since the quests don't demand one, but I will allow each deck to have up to 6 cards (counting multiples) in its sideboard. But outside of that, if you want to make changes, I'm not going to be a huge stickler about it, just that you do need to play all three quests with the same deck+sideboard, so no deck overhauls can be made between decks.

http://ringsdb.com/deck/view/47754 [http://ringsdb.com/deck/view/47754]  (I hope the link works, never linked one of my decks before)

 

It is not the most innovative deck and may look familiar to our auctioneer, as you can see in the deck's description, but it was my plan once I got Elrond, plus I usually used him with Gandalf when playing solo, so I thought it is a good time to just focus on one of them. In addition I find it somewhat thematic, that two Hobbits get the support of Elrond, who summons some of the greatest heroes of their time for their cause.

He was added pretty late in the game. There are still people that could pick him up though.

Aren't only 6 Cards allowed in the sideboard? I don't think it really matters, just saying^^

I always thought it was 15 ¿?

Actually I never use the sideboard anyways so it shouldn't matter. It's just cards I may use to tune the deck a little bit in the future if needed, but I never switch cards for specific quests

I can't view your deck @JusticeLizard. I think you need to enable deck sharing (can't remember exactly what it's called) in your settings.

For this specific challenge, Seastan wanted to restrict to 6. Normally a sideboard can be whatever you want, but 15 is a good number to cover most bases.

Sorry about that.  This is my first time using ringsdb.  I used cardgamedb a couple times just for saga recording purposes, but usually I just build my decks physically.

No, double down and go with 52!  Think of the possibilities!

No worries! Seems to be working now. Looks like a fun deck! Sam can really pack a punch.

Updated. Still waiting on some decklists.

Also, it's not too late to bid on a hero. Given the lack of bidding, the remaining heroes now are first come first serve... bid on one and I will lock it in right away!

Anything in the chart on the first post that are not greyed out and listed under Seastan. He's used that as a placeholder marking the minimum bid required.

 

Also - apologies for the delay in my decklists! I'll have them by Friday.

In the initial build I forgot that Na'asiyah can't play allies, so I swapped out the Defenders of Rammas for some Grappling Hooks, wich might be more useful anyway.

Dori-TaBoromir-TaTheoden

http://ringsdb.com/deck/view/49449 [http://ringsdb.com/deck/view/49449]

Starting at 23 threat, I figured I wouldn't bother with trying to Good Harvest Snowmane/Herugrim onto TaTheoden, and just rely on Boromir's readying (and Support of the Eagles) to carry the day.  Sadly, Steward of Orthanc isn't out yet, which is perfect for mono-tactics.  Fortunately Wait No Longer is already out, I think that card is going to be insanely powerful in solo mono-tactics.

Updated.

Paging cmabr002, jjenks576, Elu_Thingol, DurinVoronwe, Network57. Awaiting your decklists.

Paging danpoage and Crabble - you are just 1 hero short of a complete set! You can claim any hero remaining on the list. I will also allow you to pick any hero that is not on the list at all at +2 threat cost.

May I edit my deck if I get my hands on a new adventure pack (I really need prepare for battle, but don't own the Mumakil yet)?

If you have your eyes set on an upcoming card, then I would rule that you need to leave space for it in your sideboard (so if you want to include 2 copies of it when it comes out, then only fill 4/6 of your sideboard slots).

## 226 [Seastan on March 25, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/241829-the-middle-earth-hero-auction/?do=findComment&comment=2702509)

The quests you will be doing are:

 

Easy: Flight to the Ford OR The Mumakil (your choice)

Medium: The Steward's Fear

Hard: The Wastes of Eriador

(Note: If one of your heroes is Frodo or Amarthiul, you can still play Flight and Wastes - you can just ignore the uniqueness rule for those cards).

Again, the mode of play is up to you. But be sure to give a report on how the quests went in some form (i.e. here on the forums, or by editing your deck description on ringsdb, or making a blog post, etc.).

Best of luck!

I'll write up a fuller report later, but my first quest went much better than you seemed to think it would, given my heroes! Rossiel and Eleanor had a first hand of 2x Resourceful, 3x Faint, and None Return, and opening turn drew another None Return. Elfhelm had a first-hand Roheryn, Firefoot, Rohan Warhorse, and Steward of Gondor. Well powered-up, and ended up with 10 cards in the Victory display, but only 1 turn away from defeat.

And I just now remembered I even forgot to trigger Thalin's reaction the entire game!

Well, looks like you got a good pair of decks! Feel free to try nightmare mode, or a harder quest, if you feel my choices weren't challenging enough!

Yeah, we are thinking about it.  Wastes was definitely the hardest of the three for us but we were in control for pretty much the entire time, but we almost got "cheesed" by the Steward's Fear.  We got the plot that discards cards from our deck and we also got the enemy that makes you discard cards when he attacks.  We managed to still win because we got the clue that lets you add 2 tokens to the quest so we were able to prevent being stalled for too long and getting decked.

Flight to the Ford was interesting because Haldir has difficulty getting to 9 damage but we were fortunate and I drew both Secret Vigils so we were able to keep our threat low enough to never get swarmed by Nazgul.

I assume you attached Secret Vigils to Nazgul as they are the only enemies in FttF scenario. But I'm afraid they are not valid targets for Vigils, because they have "Cannot have non-Morgul attachments." (and the Witch-king is immune).

You are correct and it was a mistake on my part.  I guess Galadhrim's Greetings could have kept my threat low enough since Elu_Thingol never used them and had access to extra resources thanks to Resourceful, though it may have taken another turn to get Glorfindel into play.  We also had Robin Smallburrow in play so I imagine we could've used his ability if necessary, though I can't say for certain if my mistake with Secret Vigil mattered significantly or not.

Alas, there still aren't many threat reduction cards in the pool outside Spirit sphere. Secret Vigil is one of the best, in my opinion, but in this particular quest is, simply put, useless.

There is also one interesting, pretty new card: Well Warned. It costs 0, it works with immunes and enemies like Nazgul that cannot have attachments, and can be played by the player who has Spirit when any player engages enemy to reduce this player's threat. But it still needs Spirit to resource match and of course this Noble-Scout duo...

Scenario: Flight to the Ford     Heroes: Sam Gamgee, Bilbo Baggins, Fatty Bolger    Starting Threat:19     # of Attempts: 1     Final Score: 96

I went into this game feeling very confident.  These are the heroes I have been with running through the saga campaign.  So I know they have beat this quest before, with a higher starting threat.  Things changed after my first draw, and a mulligan revealed no resource generating cards.  Then on turn two I pulled a Black Steed, which meant I would have to deal with a Nazgul enemy before I was ready.  Luckily, I had a Test of Will in hand.  Also, turn two had me playing a Peace, and Thought.  After that the resources and cards came rolling in.  The deck worked just as I had envisioned.  I used a sneak attack playing Gandalf three times, and paid for him three more.  I drew through the entire deck.  Test of Will was played three more times.  I got a little nervous when I got to six remaining life and I was still on the first stage.  Thankfully that was the turn around, as the game ended two turns later.  I think the real star of this deck is Heed the Dream.  In a game with Steward of Gondor, it really makes extreme combos reliable.  I am looking forward to future challenges when the engagement cost of the enemies is lower, to see how my reduced threat is a factor.

We played three games of Wastes of Eriador.

In the first game, our threats went racing up, but otherwise we had no problems as we each got a solid collection of allies and plenty of defence and healing. Eventually we managed to draw some threat reduction and everything was straightforward from there.

In the second game it immediately took our hand away with Lost in the Wilderness, then turned to night, and brought out 3 wolves in the first turn. This ended more or less as you'd imagine.

The third game was much like the first except without threat gain. I think I (Lore/Leadership deck) ended up with all of my allies on the board.

 

We'll play the Steward's Fear next, which could be quite annoying thanks to the low engagement cost enemies including the ever-troublesome Zealous Traitor.

Senario: The Stewart's Fear  Heroes: Sam Gamgee, Bilbo Baggins, Fatty Bolger   Starting Threat: 19   # of Attempts: 1   Final Score: 146

 

    This game was a good test of my greatest fear.  On the very first turn I was faced with the Umbar assasin.  With a total of eight hp, my heroes couldn't take more than a couple rounds of its archery 2.  I also couldn't engage it to kill it, as it would deal three damage to a hero.  None of my heroes have more than three hp.  In the end, dwarven sellswords took the arrows while Gandalf fought the brigand from afar.

    I was happy to see that my reduced starting threat did become a factor.  I was able to engage one enemy at a time, thereby avoiding the penalties for non-optional engagements.  

    I am doutfull of my chances on the next quest.  I have already had one attempt that failed spectacularly.

Wastes can have pretty brutal setups. But at least you don't have to invest a whole lot of time in your loses in that case.

Senario: The Wastes of Eriador    Heroes: Sam Gamgee, Bilbo Baggins, Fatty Bolger   Starting Threat: 19    # of Attempts: 2    Final Score: 169

 

      I am going to admit up front that my win felt like it had a bit of luck.  Nothing disastrous jumped out of the encounter deck the first few bonus draws for switching to night.  The scariest moment was when the treachery that deals damage equal to the number of questers came up the second time.  It would have killed Fatty and Bilbo if I didn't have Bill the Pony there to give them an extra hit point each.  Once again the fear of the deck was my low hit points, and the strength was my extra reduced threat.  This time, instead of it letting me deal with one enemy at a time, it let me worry less about the extra threat I was gaining at the first stage.  I took my time and built Sam in to a resource generating, multi defending monster.  By the time I advanced to the second stage I was playing a Gandalf a turn to bring my threat back down.

    My plot was Poisoned Counsels, and my villain was The Hand of Castamir.  I felt this was a good combo for me because the plots extra threat and the villian being the one with the highest engagement cost worked to my strength of low threat.  Sam may have been the MVP of the series, but in his victory speech he would credit Fatty for giving me four extra threat points to work with.  

 

    I just want to say this was a fun experience, and I hope I can get my wife to join in if there is another auction. (She will :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png])

We only had time for one play of Steward's Fear this week. We got lots of Sewers at the beginning which meant a big explosion of brigands at one point. As I expected the Zealous Traitors were the main threat. At one point they killed the only Warden of Healing that I drew, but Glorfindel gets enough resources with the Steward to use his healing every turn. This is actually a better ability than I'd thought. Our plot was the one that increases threat, which was no danger to us, and the enemy was Hand of Castamir, who was annoying but didn't last long.

I finally got my Mûmakil pack some days ago, so I built my deck and tested it against that same quest:

 

Deck [http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/4682/i-wanted-gandalf-elrond-and-aragorn-at-0-threat-almost-1.0] (19 initial threat): Erkenbrand (6) + Dúnhere (5) + Bifur (8) 

 

1st attempt

ughhhh... who said this quest was easy? lol. Probably it took me by surprise, since I had no strategy planned for dealing with the Mûmak. Anyways: With no threat reduction, my deck has at most 2 turns of secrecy, and it quickly reduced to only the 1st turn since I got a doomed-1 card during questing. That hurt. At least I was able to play Resourceful, a secrecy ally and Timely Aid -> Gléowine before, and later I decided to travel asap to the Mûmak Trail location during Travel phase.

I didn't want to explore Mûmak Trail fast, because I didn't want the Mûmak to come so early into the staging area (and definitely didn't want the Mûmak to get lost wandering in the encounter deck), and I decided to turtle a little and get several allies into play. After 2~3 turns I explored Mûmak Trail, and then the Mûmak came in and killed a bunch of chump blockers. 

Now, here is where things started to go wrong: While I was still in the 1st part of the quest, I got a bunch of locations revealed during questing, and I decided not to travel (and explore) any of them because I didn't want to add more Mûmaks to the encounter deck. I guess I over-panicked with the idea of revealing more Mumaks. Thing is, at some point I revealed the "Guardians of the Jungle" side quest, which at first glance seemed like a very innocent card, but man, it hurted a lot; even for a 1-player game. I mean, I constantly had between 3~6 locations in the staging area, and that side quest was increasing threat like crazy. I was barely being able to add progress.

Somehow though, thanks to Gléowine draw power and plenty of resources with the help of 2 Resourcefuls and the Steward of Gondor, I managed to keep the pace adding chumpblockers, and OHaUH Gandalf + Firyal became the stars of the game, adding a lot of willpower plus control over the encounter deck via scrying. Very slowly, and after quite some turns, I finally defeated stage 1, which allowed me to travel to all those **** locations in the staging area. The fear of adding more Mumaks was gone, but the staging area still had plenty of locations and threat (between 16~21)... 

More locations were coming out o_O, and I wasn't being able to put more than 1 or 2 progress per turn; luckily, no enemies were at sight, which allowed me to focus all my combat efforts on the Mûmak, and after some rounds it finally went down, not before killing my Erkenbrand though >_>. With the **** oliphaunt gone, all that was left was to put some more progress onto quest stage n° 2

Final part: Race between the much needed progress vs increasing threat, both in the staging area and in my threat dial. Because I had OHaUH Gandalf around for some rounds, my threat was quickly reaching 50. At some point I drew another Gandalf so I sacrificed the one in play to save myself 2 threat. Things come to a crucial point: End of the round, and my threat is at 47. Decision time: do I keep Gandalf? If I decide so, then next round is the last round.... but if I sacrifice him, then there is serious risk of threating out and/or enemies coming in to complicate things before being able to finish the game.... ughhh...  ... ... .. . .   . .  Welp, here goes nothing: I decide to keep Gandalf around, knowing therefore that the next turn will be my last no matter what. I draw a 1 willpower ally; of course anything helps so the ally enters play. I quest with everything: My willpower is... 28. Total threat in the staging area: 18. There is an active location that needs 2 progress to be explored, and after all that, 5 more progress needed to clear quest stage 2. I trigger Firyal and I see... a Giant Centipede! that's 3 extra threat... I start to make calculations and... yesss!!! Giant Centipede will do: barely enough progress to clear the quest o_O!

Final result: Victory (barely)

Turns: +120

Threat: +49

Dead Heroes: +8

Damaged Heroes: 0

Victory Display: -4

Total Score: 173

2nd attempt:

Went muuuuch more smoothly. Barely any difficulties. I managed to play 2 Resourcefuls on round 1, plus a Ithilien Lookout. I quest with everything: 5 total willpower. I reveal... a giant Centipede (...memories). its 3 threat plus the 2 threat from the Mûmak Trail means I make no progress, but also that my threat doesn't increase which is all that matters because it gives me an extra round of secrecy.

Next round: I play Quickbeam, and Timely Aid -> Firyal... and that's pretty much game lol. Firyal is too awesome. During questing I reveal a simple non-harmful location. Dúnhere kills the Centipede in the staging area, and at the end of the round I play "Peace, and Thought". I draw Steward, OHaUH Gandalf, Ghân-buri-Ghân... I simply can't lose.

So as you can expect, easy victory this time. Besides the Centipede and the obligatory Mûmak, the only other enemy I got was a Python. I mostly revealed 2-threat locations and a lot of handle-able treacheries which allowed me to quest fast. Getting chumpblockers was no issue, and even with chumpblockers feeding the Wild Mûmak every round I still swarmed the table with a bunch of other allies. At some point I played Timely Aid -> Gildor for some extra over-kill hilarity.

So yeah, easy quest this time.

Final result: Victory

Turns: +80

Threat: +36

Dead Heroes: 0

Damaged Heroes: 0

Victory Display: -4

I finished the 3 quests on normal difficulty. As expected my deck is terrible, if I don't get Vilya, so I lost quite some games.

1) Flight to the Ford: Had to try 2 games without Vilya in my starting hand, what failed miserably, so I am only going to write some lines about the round I got it and didn't loose in round 3^^
Even in that game it was close (Frodo was down to 3 life) and the reveal cancel from fellowship Frodo was crucial. As the quest is quite a race, most attacks where tanked by my Frodo for threat which didn't bother me to much as the game should be over quickly and Merry managed to reduce my threat by 5 and one keen as lances by another 4.
Elrond and his ring took a few rounds setting things up, but once the breaking point was reached it was over quickly.
Had some trouble with a Nazgul during the early rounds as I held back some attackers for a one-shot (quite easy when nearly everything Vilya pulls has at least 2 attack), but it got the shadow card which returns it to the staging area. Twice. That was a lot of character actions wasted and would have made the run a lot easier as the Nazgul generates a good amount of threat too.
I didn't have to much trouble with the Witch-king in return, as he and most other Nazguls got washed away by wrath of the Bruinen.
Quests on a counter are always a little nerve wrecking for me and I tend to not like them, so I was happing to advance to:

2) The Steward's Fear: I opened with 3 loses (2 times no Vilya, which I now instant conceded after the first draw), the other time I got over-run by the encounter deck. I managed to win the next game, but during a final look at the game I noticed that I forgot to reveal the additional encounter cards unholy alliance forces you to reveal (so I literally played without a plot), what I couldn't count as a true win, so here is the final game (spoiler: I win :D):
My starting hand was god-like: Vilya, light and UC, played light quested with everyone and then used Vilya after questing. I revealed Gandalf, who I could have used to snipe the revealed dissident, however there was no new location and I had a little fear from the underworld card under the fourth star so I lowered my threat with Gandalf and used him to defend. Sadly the shadow cad returned the enemy to the staging area. Next turn I played courage on Elrond and brought Treebeard into play. For questing I cleared the fourth star and got a traitor from the underworld card. Managed to defend him and the dissident and got Steward of Gondor from Vilya, so Elrond was powered up completely. I played Gleowine as a chumpblocker too. Staging was great, market square and under the active location was the prisoner (objective that puts 2 resources on the active quest). After chump-blocking and sacrificing Gleowine I got a double kill on my two engaged enemies, what (in retrospective) is clearly the turning point of the game as I now were in full control with a fully operative Elrond and Treebeard.
I had to discard my hand though (at least only 3 cards), what ended up not mattering at all as I just played my drawn card every turn thanks to Elrond and a resourceful I got the next turn from Vilya. While clearing the locations (houses of the dead showed up, but was harmless, as I could easily exhaust all my characters, while no enemies where to be seen and treebeard had the potential for 3 actions), local trouble hit Elrond (who then neither used Vilya nor his response, which would helped my single warden heal of the damage from an umbar assassin).
After finishing stage one I got "Up in flames" as my plot (had 30 cards left in my deck, so a lot of time). Merry got some information from our prisoner and at the roots of the mindoluin I found another clue, which Merry grabbed again, so stage 2 was over in no time.
The villain turned out to be the daughter of Berúthiel. She was no match for me as I still was below 40 threat and could keep her engaged easily for the one round it took to kill her with my team. Following round I quested for the win.
I ended up with a total of two local troubles (Frodo and Elrond), -15 threat from three Gandalfs. The only plot/villain-combo that could have been dangerous would have been unholy alliance and the hand of Castamir with an ugly attack chain.

Finally with a clean win I moved to:
 

3) The wastes of Eriador: This was the quest I expected the best performance from my deck, as this is the longest quest by nature of the design, something playing into the hands of my deck. Got Vilya after a mulligan and nothing very tense or exciting happened all game long :(. The opening card reveal gave me the opportunity to grab an enemy of my choice from the encounter deck and everything went smoothly after that. Some notable things: I was forced to bring a side-quest into play (chose lost in the wilderness), which I wanted to clear the following round, what ended up being very lucky, as it not only worked, but during staging I got cold from Angmar which attached to the active quest and instantly removed itself this way :). During stage two I was forced to discard a non-objective ally once it became night by the effect on stage 2b, what happens at the end of the round. As Gandalf is also discarded at the end of the round I chose to trigger the night thing first and discard Gandalf, before he would do it himself (if this isn't allowed it wouldn't have mattered as there were about 15 other allies I could have discarded). Overkilled pack leader in the end by a lot.

It was fun, even though I don't think I will play this deck more often as other hero combinations should work better, while achieving the same goal (the Elrond+Vilya-Combo) and this one is really hit or miss, leading to games you either totally dominate and win without much fear or totally loose. Only the flight game was tense and that probably because of the ringbearer's life ticking down.
Maybe I will try the nightmare version of flight (it's the only of the three quests I have) before I scrap the deck.

Thanks for organising everything Seastan, was fun playing and bidding :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

EDIT: Well, that went pretty well apart from my computer crashing in the middle of my first attempt at Wastes of Eriador. For all that a poorly thought out play lost me a hero on Flight to the Ford, Wastes was the only quest of the three which really posed a challenge, and even then I kind of crushed it once I was established. I'll sort out the youtube VOD in a bit.

Nice work so far everyone. I haven't heard any reports yet from someone who is completely stuck by one of the quests, so it seems like people were pretty good at the bidding game.

Last weekend I did try the first quest (Flight) with the dwarves.  I actually recorded turn-by-turn play, but its a lot to type.  I lost, but I literally lost, by 1 quest point, on the final round.  It was a sad day indeed.  I'm going to try to get into it again soon, but with finals approaching it might be a few weeks until I can provide results.  

Is that ok?

Oh it was still a great game! Learned a lot about what I need to do and such.  The treachery "Power in Their Terror" ruined me mid-game...with so many dwarves at little HP (no hardy leadership on the table) they got beat down pretty quickly.  I thought that was the straw there, and thought about scooping, but decided to push forth, and nearly came back.  Was a great game!

Time to go against The Steward's Fear!

Deck [http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/4682/i-wanted-gandalf-elrond-and-aragorn-at-0-threat-almost-1.0] (19 initial threat): Erkenbrand (6) + Dúnhere (5) + Bifur (8) 

 

1st attempt

Everything that could go wrong, happened here -_-. My opening hand was terrible, so I took a mulligan and the new hand was... even worse!... I got a bunch of high-cost allies, and just one secrecy card plus Peace, and Thought to play with during the initial rounds. Peace and Thought didn't help much: I drew more high-cost cards, and so, my two turns of secrecy quickly abandoned me leaving little in return :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

4th or 5th round, and the encounter deck revealed my doom. Can you guess what happened? Of course: A Knife in the Back came in, and the randomly chosen ally is... Quickbeam >_> What's worse, is that I misread the text of this treachery, and for some reason I thought the hero that had to be damaged was also picked at random (which I know now that's not the case); the randomly chosen hero was Bifur, who had Steward of Gondor attached... yeah that was pretty much game (had I read the ruling properly, I would've chosen a full-health Dúnhere).

Despite losing a hero so early (and the most important one, given that Lore is the main sphere in my deck), I kept trying to see how far I could reach. Surprisingly, I did quite well considering the circumstances; I quickly drew a 2nd Steward of Gondor, so I could keep the pace with resources. This 2nd SoG was attached to Dúnhere, which allowed me to play several spirit allies. Progress was slow, but at least I was making some progress though.

Anyways, the encounter deck had no mercy and now the Underworld deck began to throw a bunch of Zealous Traitors into play, which obliterated my allies army. Severely damaged, I advanced to the 2nd quest stage, and the Plot revealed was the one that makes me discard my deck... I was able to reach this point despite losing a hero, access to Lore, and most of my allies, but the Plot put a clear death sentence: I still had plenty of progress to make, plenty of turns to overcome, and my deck had around 18 cards, so any chance of victory I could've had, dropped to a clear 0,00%... Still, I wanted to keep playing, until I blocked an enemy attack who had the shadow card that makes you discard your entire hand... yeah that was more that I could endure. After that, I just gave up.

 

Final result: Defeat...

 

2nd attempt

Quite the opposite this time; my deck worked wonders! First round: Dúnhere plays Resourceful on Erkenbrand (to play a SoG I had in hand during the next round), Bifur "steals" a resource from Erkenbrand, and plays a Ithilien Lookout for 1, and saves a lore resource to play Peace, and Thought by the end of the round. The encounter deck revealed Houses of the Dead this 1st round; tough card, but manage-able.

2nd round: With the previously played Peace, and Thought I drew a second Resourceful and Timely Aid. mmmm Steward will have to wait another round, because I want to play that Timely Aid while I'm still on secrecy; and that was a good call, since with Timely Aid I got Firyal into play! yesss!! the encounter card revealed this round is Storehouse; nothing to fear.

Next rounds: Steward comes down in round 3, and several allies (Ghân-buri-Ghân, Quickbeam, Arwen, Gléowine, several secrecy allies) begin to swarm the table. Faramir comes next, which completely solves the questing aspect of the game. No "A Knife in the Back" treacheries this time; no Zealous Traitors at sight. The Underworld deck was merciful this time, revealing two Clues, and Pickpocket enemies mostly which do little to no harm. Dúnhere had a lot of fun with these guys.

Progress was slow at first, but once my table was all setup with enough allies, things began to move fast later. Plot revealed: the one that makes me reveal two encounter cards during staging. It looked quite dangerous at first glance, but honestly it didn't hurt that much. The 2nd quest stage went down very quick thanks to the Clues around. Final stage: before advancing into it, I ask for OHaUH Gandalf's assistance to deal with the boss, and the boss revealed is Telemnar's Bane (the one that makes me discard cards from my deck). He attacks, kills a chumpblocker, and is immediately killed in return. Last round is easy: I quest with a total willpower of 43, and nothing can prevent me from claiming victory.

 

Final result: Victory

Turns: +100

Threat: +40

Dead Heroes: 0

Damaged Heroes: 0

Victory Display: -2

Total Score: 138

Way to push on after losing your Steward hero in that first attempt. I would have scooped right then.

Last quest: The Wastes of Eriador

Deck [http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/4682/i-wanted-gandalf-elrond-and-aragorn-at-0-threat-almost-1.0] (19 initial threat): Erkenbrand (6) + Dúnhere (5) + Bifur (8) 

 

1st attempt

I can definitely see why this quest is considered hard. I have to admit I had more fun this time; I remember playing this quest a long time ago and not having the best impression, but things change for the best I guess. Anyways:

First turn: During setup I got the Cold from Angmar treachery, which makes me hurt a hero and blanks the text on damaged heroes. Erkenbrand got the hit. Next, time to play my cards, and btw I got a really good hand. Resourceful on Erkenbrand, Timely Aid -> Bofur (this was kinda disappointing, although Bofur helped a lot in the long run), and Risk some Light to control the encounter deck these first rounds. With the help of this event, I select the first encounter card to be revealed: a Rugged Country location, probably the least harmful card to see. Nice. 

Next rounds: Nightfall comes, and no more secrecy. I have to reveal an encounter card... another Cold from Angmar. mmm Erkenbrand gets a second damage token. I don't do much the 2nd round besides playing Warden of Healing. Questing time: another treachery! it's Pressing Needs, which makes me search for a Side Quest. I choose Lost in the Wilderness. Yeah this card kidnaps my entire hand, but honestly I only had high-cost cards, so it's not too terrible.

After some more rounds I begin to establish my allies army. Arwen, Firyal, Celduin Traveler, Mablung, and Timely Aid -> Quickbeam (...). The encounter deck is gentle enough, and it doesn't throw much enemies. Only a Hunting Pack: a 40-cost enemy which stays in the staging area forever, and a couple of Northern Wargs, which are quickly two-rounded by Dúnhere.

With more allies coming in (Gildor, Galadhrim Minstrel, another Celduin Traveler), I can quest a ton during Day Time. Once I advance onto second round, I decide to put down OHaUH Gandalf. It's kind of a gamble: my threat is at ~28 and  I'm just starting the 2nd quest stage. It does pay off though, because with the help of the wizard I "one-hit-KO" the 2nd stage when it's Day Time. 

So, the last stage flips in. Definitely the most feared moment: the boss Pack Leader enters play; the Hunting Pack from the very beginning is still in the staging area, and the Night Time objective adds a third enemy... My allies army is strong and abundant though. A chumpblocker goes down defending against the boss, and the just-added enemy is defended without problems and killed asap in return. Time comes in: I play an Ithilien Lookout and scry the encounter deck to check how much questing I need to make. These scrying guys help a lot with the math. Anyways, I put the needed 5 progress on the last stage to be able to damage and kill the boss later. Night kicks in, more enemies added, but overall I have so many allies around, that blocking and killing is not really an issue. Day phase comes back. Gandalf leaves me because I don't need his extra threat anymore, and the last stage is cleared. Overall, this was a pretty solid victory; I felt I had control the whole time.

 

Final result: Victory

Turns: +90

Threat: +46

Dead Heroes: 0

Damaged Heroes: +3

Victory Display: -13

Total Score: 126

Was Steward's Fear supposed to be hard because it's a difficult quest or because it's obnoxious? I only had time for one playthrough but I think across 5 turns, I revealed 1 Enemy before threating out from location lock. Despite getting 4 Mounts out on the Elfhelm deck, and 5 Outlands Allies and four 0-point Victory cards with the Rossiel/Eleanor deck...

I'll try again tomorrow. I remember this quest being more enjoyable the first time.

Yeah, I felt kind of the same way. I remember really enjoying this quest back in the day, but this time I just wasn't feeling it.

2nd attempt

This second and last attempt can be resumed in "total control". The MVP was the event Risk Some Light, easily. This card allows me to scry the first three cards from the encounter deck, move one to the bottom if I choose to, and return the cards to the encounter deck in the order I want. Usually it costs 3, but it's free under secrecy. I got the three copies in this run. One was in my opening hand, which meant "free" 1st turn.

The encounter card revealed on setup was the Rugged Country location, which honestly does nothing to worry about. After that, with the help of scrying (Risk Some Light, Firyal, Ithilien Lookouts and Celduin Travelers), every quest phase was free lol. I don't feel like going into much detail, since this 2nd attempt was pretty similar to the 1st one. Although it took me longer this time (in my 1st attempt I resolved the 2nd stage in one go; here it took me two Day phases to clear that same stage), I felt that this 2nd attempt was much easier. Scrying is just too good. Just to illustrate how powerful it is, an example: When the objective is flipped to Night Time at the end of the round, you have to reveal an encounter card. With the help of Risk Some Light, I chose the treachery Bitting Wind to be revealed. This treachery damages questing characters, but at the end of the round... it does literally nothing... and I did this twice.

Nothing much to add tbh... Near the end I got the side quest Lost in the Wilderness. It stole my whole hand, but by that point the quest was pretty much resolved anyways. I have to say that my opinion on this quest has 180'd and I consider it a really fun quest now.

 

Final result: Victory

Turns: +110

Threat: +44

Dead Heroes: 0

Damaged Heroes: 0

Victory Display: -3

Total Score: 151

 

---

 

Final words on my heroes and deck: Bifur is solid. Dúnhere is cool; it may sound weird, but it's the 1st time I try him (when I got the Core Set, I also got several APs so from the very beginning I've had plenty of heroes to pick from). Erkenbrand is meh. I hate his (lack of) traits, which aren't good at all imo for a defender. With Gondor trait you have Gondorian Shield. Hobbit trait -> You have Hobbit cloak, Fast Hitch. Dwarf, Silvan and Noldor are also better traits overall since they synergize better with other traits. Rohan offers so little... and Erkenbrand doesn't help at all with setups. His stats distribution is weird too. 

Secrecy, scrying... I want these in all my decks lol. I've always been surprised by the lack of scrying capabilities in most of the decks published in Ringsdb. Firyal is awesome. And regarding secrecy: so many good cards with secrecy. Risk Some Light, Resourceful, Timely Aid... Just Resourceful on its own is enough reason to do the efforts for building secrecy decks. Overall, I think my next deck will be pretty similar to this one. I'll just change my heroes for Sam - Pippin - Merry (always wanted to try them), and keep most of the deck unchanged.

---

Last: Thanks to seastan for running this. The bidding part was super fun. My first attempt was to build an Elrond-Tactics Imrahil deck (for Vilya - Imrahil's ability - A Very Good Tale combo). After losing them, secrecy was the next target. I really wanted Celeborn, to gain more willpower and put Unlikely Friendhip in my deck along with Bifur...  welp, I guess this is how things work out with bids around right? Quests were fun too. Looking forward for the next auction!

This is a really nice tactic! Thanks for the write-up. One note though - I think the card you keep talking about is Risk Some Light, not Out of the Wild.

It's definitely Risk Some Light, yep. Don't know why I confused them, I've never used Out of the Wild in any deck. Thanks for the correction, I'll fix my post

With finals over as of yesterday, I sat down to finally get down to business.  Dwarves pulled it out against the Flight to the Ford - guess their stubby little legs can outrun the Nazgul after all (cause they certainly weren't riding horses).

I pushed it really hard, used Frodo's ability when needed to save my low health dwarven allies, and even washed away the Witch King.  I ended up simply beating the quest by questing super hard - I had a timely "Untroubled by Darkness" which helped boost the willpower of the board state pretty high. 

Onward we go later this weekend!

I finally got around to using my mono-tactics deck against the "easy" quest, Flight to the Ford.  I've published the deck (Dori/TaBoromir/TaTheoden) here:

https://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/5604/middle-earth-hero-auction-23-threat-1.0 [https://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/5604/middle-earth-hero-auction-23-threat-1.0]

I was a little worried about this one -- the deck has Dunedain Hunter and Wait No Longer, but this quest only has Nazgul enemies and they're pretty tough.  Still, if mono-Tactics can't take down Nazgul, who can?  I choose the Black Riders Frodo for my ringbearer, since that's the only cancellation option I can get.

Opening hand was 2x Winged Guardian, Support of the Eagles, Treebeard, Book of Eldacar, and Wait no Longer.  I gladly keep this, because Support of the Eagles + Winged Guardian means Boromir can defend for 6 -- even Nazgul have a tough time getting through that.  Plus I can't resist Treebeard, and in this quest (thanks to Frodo) I can put Treebeard in play on turn one, if I'm willing to delay the defensive setup.

Turn 1: (Threat 23, Life 15)

I drew the Eagles are Coming, played that and pulled in Gwaihir.  I use everyone's resources and put Treebeard into play exhausted.

Facing three threat (Fell Rider + The Last Bridge), I send Boromir, Frodo and Theoden (7 wp).  I plan to engage the Fell Rider rather than let him drain Frodo's life, so I want Dori + Boromir for defense -- it'll be another two turns before I get Guardian + Support in place.

The Enemy Upon Us is revealed and has no effect (no engaged enemies), so it surges into a copy of the Ettenmoors.  5 threat vs 7 wp gets stage 1 progress to 2/15).  I travel to the Ettenmoors, which will cost me a life next turn but prevents shadow cards.

I engage the Fell Rider, and Boromir + Dori defend.  No damage.

Turn 2: (Threat 25, Life 14)

I draw Envoy of Pelargir.  Bilbo's resource comes in handy again, as I play the Envoy and put one of the resources back on Boromir, giving me 3 tactics resources still.  This enables me to play the Winged Guardian.

I send Frodo, Boromir, Theoden, and Envoy (8 wp).  Dori's being reserved so that Dori + Boromir + Treebeard can take out the Fell Rider (combined 9 attack).

I reveal another Fell Rider, for 3 total threat.  5 progress clears Ettenmoors (damaging Frodo) and gets quest progress to 4/15.

I travel to the Last Bridge, revealing the Burden "Weight of the Ring".  This  requires me to exhaust the ring or reveal an additional encounter card.  I will exhaust the ring in every following turn, so Frodo's ability is completely nerfed.

I had a plan to get rid of a Fell Rider, and I'm not going to drop it just because another one shows up.  I'll gamble with the Guardian instead.  I engage the second Fell Rider, have the Guardian defend one, taking no damage and paying to keep him around with my last resource.  Boromir defends against the other, without Dori's help he takes 2 damage (3/5 hp).  Then Boromir + Dori + Treebeard take down a Fell Rider.  We're down to one Fell Rider and the staging area is empty, plus a Winged Guardian in play and the ability to play Support of the Eagles next turn.  Life is good.

Turn 3: (Threat 28, Life 12)

I draw Dunedain Hunter.  Feeling cocky, I play Support of the Eagles and Dunedain Hunter -- with 6 defense I fear no ringwraiths.  He whiffs.

I want to take the other Fell Rider down, so again I send Theoden, Boromir, Frodo, and Envoy for 8 wp.

I reveal Pale Blade and attach it to the Fell Rider.  I laugh at 5 attack.  It surges into another Ettenmoors.  With 6 progress I clear the bridge and am now at 6/15.  I travel to Ettenmoors, ensuring no nasty shadows will stand in the way of taking this one down.

Combat is now deterministic, Boromir defends for no damage and then Boromir/Dori/Treebeard dispatch another Fell Rider.  Empty staging area, no engaged enemies.

Turn 4: (Threat 31, Life 11)

I draw another copy of Wait No Longer.  But I'm not ready to use it just yet.  Plus I'd like to get Gwaihir in play.

With no enemies in play, I send everyone but the Winged Guardian questing (12 wp).

I reveal Pale Blade -- no Nazgul.  It surges into another Fell Rider.  With 10 progress I clear Ettenmoors and am now at 13/15 progress.

I engage the Fell Rider, ready Boromir to defend, and take no damage.

Turn 5: (Threat 33, Life 9)

I draw the Eagles are coming, and play it -- it whiffs.

For questing, I play Wait No Longer -- if it hits, I only need 2 wp to clear the quest and then everybody else can work on the wraiths.  It hits and finds another Fell Rider.  I send Frodo and he places 2 progress since no cards are revealed.  Stage 1 is cleared -- stage 2 comes out and out comes Ford of Brunien and the Witch-King.

I travel to the Ford of Brunien and reveal Piercing Cry -- I choose to bring back a Fell Rider from the discard, since I want enemies to stay in the deck for my other Wait No Longer.  I place the Fell Rider engaged with me and engage the Witch King.

I now have three Fell Riders and the Witch King engaged.  Nearly everybody is ready, but eliminating wraiths doesn't mean much with the Ford as the active location; I just need to survive.

Boromir defends against the Witch King, with Dori's help (8 defense) and takes no damage.  Ordinarily Boromir can't defend against the Witch-King, but Theoden has raised his willpower to 2 instead of 1.

Boromir then readies and defends against Fell Rider #1, then Fell Rider #2, then Fell Rider #3, then Fell Rider #3 again (shadow effect).  Aside from running threat up, there's no damage.  Treebeard/Envoy/Theoden hit the Witch-King to damage him just because they can, but I'm counting on the Ford to clear him away.

Turn 6: (Threat 38, Life 8) -- four wraiths engaged.

I draw Support of the Eagles, but I play Gwaihir.

For the quest phase I play Wait No Longer, which finds a Ringwraith and has him engaged.  There will be no reveal, and there will soon be no enemies, so I send everyone but the Winged Guardian for 14 wp.  The Ford is cleared, discarding five ringwraiths and getting progress to 8/15.

Turn 7: (Threat 39, Life 7) -- no enemies, no active location, nothing in staging.

I draw my final copy of Wait No Longer -- but since pulling a wraith out will add 15 to the quest points needed, I choose not to use it here.  I send everyone but Winged Guardian and Dori (in case a wraith comes out, Boromir + self-readying Treebeard + Dori can take it down) for 12 wp.

Rode Like a Gale is revealed, but has no effect and surges.  Power in their Terror comes out, reducing the willpower of my allies and destroying my Winged Guardian and the Envoy (0 wp allies take 2 damage).  That reduces my willpower to 9, but with no location and an empty staging area that's enough progress to finish stage two.  Frodo is saved!

## 269 [dalestephenson on June 22, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/241829-the-middle-earth-hero-auction/?do=findComment&comment=2848456)

Took a run at Steward's Fear with my deck.  There's two particular difficulties that I feared coming into it:

1) "Wait No Longer" isn't as powerful because enemies are few and it could whiff -- until the underworld deck is shuffled in, and then it's filled with obnoxious engagement effects.

2) Local Trouble on Boromir is devastating.  At least the first copy goes on Theoden, and starting at 23 threat I have plenty of threat to spare.  Or so I thought.

After a mulligan I ended up with a hand that includes one of my key cards (Gondorian Shield), but otherwise wasn't too exciting -- Envoy of Pelargir, Winged Guardian, Beechbone, Gwaihir, and two copies of Wait No Longer.

Turn 1: (23 threat, 0/4 stage one)

I draw another Winged Guardian, I play the envoy (net 1) and one Winged Guardian.  

I send everyone but WG (8 wp), but City Street surges into False Lead and no progress is made.

Turn 2: (24 threat, 0/4 stage one)

I draw a Sterner Than Steel, which with Gondorian Shield could come in handy some time.  I play Beechbone, coming into play exhausted.

Once again I send everyone who can help quest (8 wp), a Market Square comes out and I only place 3 progress on Fourth star.

Turn 3: (25 threat, 0/4 stage one)

I draw another copy of Sterner Than Steel.  I could've sworn I shuffled....  I play my other Winged Guardian -- I'm not sure why I would do this with one already in play and resources needed for Gwaihir, but that's what my notes say.

I send everyone but the WG for 10 willpower.  Knife in the Back is revealed, but luckily discards a Winged Guardian (0 damage).  With 5 threat in staging, I easily clear Fourth Star, and draw a Eagles are coming.  The Underworld card is a Lossornach Bandit, so wasting my resources on a duplicate Guardian isn't so bad after all.  I travel to City Street and engage the bandit, defending with Boromir (26 threat), but no point in counterattacking against his 3 defense.

Turn 4: (27 threat, 1/4 stage one)

I draw another Eagles are Coming.  I now have two of them, might as well play them -- copy one whiffs.  copy two whiffs.  I save my resources hoping to Gwaihir down.

With not much progress needed, I reserve Theoden for attack and send the rest (7 wp).  Storehouse is revealed, that allows City Street to be cleared (2/4) and I travel to Market Square.

Winged Guardian defends, Boromir (threat 28) and Theoden eliminate the bandit.

Turn 5: (29 threat, 2/4 stage one)

I draw Grimbold and play Gwaihir, bringing the other WG back into play for the turn.  With only storehouse in staging, I save Boromir and Gwaihir in case an enemy comes out and send the others for 8 wp.  Lurking in the Shadows is revealed for no effect, so it surges into Houses of the Dead -- 2 progress is enough to clear Market Square (3/4 stage one).  I travel to the 4-threat, 2-underworld Houses of the Dead, exhausting my characters with no combat needed.  One winged Guardian back to hand.

Turn 6: (30 threat, 3/4 stage one)

I draw my last Winged Guardian and play Grimbold.  Only storehouse is in staging, but I need 4 progress to progress, so Theoden, Dori, Envoy, Beechbone and Grimbold go for 10wp.  False Lead is revealed, no progress.

Turn 7: (31 threat 3/4 stage one)

I draw a Gondorian Shield and play nothing.  I send the same crew as last time for 10 wp.

Unwelcome Discovery is revealed, discards the prisoner, and surges.  Unwelcome Discovery is revealed, adds a pickpocket to staging and surges.  Local Trouble comes out and attaches itself to Theoden.  Houses of the Dead is cleared (4/4), adding Lossarnoch Bandit and Zealous Traitor to staging.  Stage 2 reveals the plot Unholy Alliance, two reveals per turn -- with a crippled Theoden and a near-useless hand, not what I was hoping for.  Roots of Mindolluin becomes the active location.

I decide to engage the Zealous Traitor first to save the life of Grimbold, but he destroys my Winged Guardian and Envoy.  The bandit takes my resources away.

Boromir defends against the pickpocket, Winged Guardian is discarded from hand.

Boromir (32 threat) defends against the bandit.

Boromir (33 threat) defends against the traitor.

Boromir (34 threat) attacks the bandit with Gwaihir and kills him.

Boromir (35 threat) attacks the pickpocket and kills him.  Theoden readying in the refresh phase takes me to 36 threat.

Turn 8: (37 threat, 0/4 progress)

With Theoden in local trouble, I'm not feeling good about my situation.  I draw Close Call, and bitterly regret adding it from sideboard instead of Secret Vigil, which would come in handy right about now.

I play Wait No Longer, hoping to reduce the damage from the double reveal.  I find an Underworld Dissident, so it doesn't whiff.

I still think I need Theoden's willpower, so I send all three heroes (38 threat) along with Grimbold and Gwaihir, saving Beechbone -- since he's damaged he can use his ability to help kill things.  That's 10 willpower.

Sewers is revealed, adding an underworld card to Roots.  Roots is cleared (1/4), and the underworld cards are the Secret Map and Scrap of History.  That really couldn't have gone better, I ready Boromir (39 threat) and claim the Secret Map, adding it to the victory display to progress to Stage 3.  The Villain is Daughter of Beruthiel.  I travel to the Sewers.

Three enemies and Boromir + Beechbone can't quite take care of the Daughter.  If I use Beechbone's ability this turn, he can knock off the daughter next turn.  It doesn't occur to me that I can discard Grimbold to keep Daughter engaged by preventing her attack (and incidentally keeping her out of staging).  Boromir defends against the traitor (40 threat), the dissident (41 threat) and the daughter (42 threat), using a Sterner than Steel to cancel a +2 attack boost and taking one damage.  Beechbone attacks the dissident and takes another damge to kill him with his ability.  The daughter goes to staging and Theoden's readying turns threat to 44.

Turn 9: 44 threat, 0/15 progress stage 5.

Grimbold still doesn't occur to me, so I don't think I can kill the daughter without 50 threat.  Well, if I must threat out, I'll take the daughter out first.

I draw Legolas -- great card, but not what I need right now.  I play my Winged Guardian.  Then in the quest phase, I play my Wait no Longer -- it reveals all sorts of nasty enemies I don't want to engage, but has a pickpocket so I pick him up.

I send Boromir, Grimbold, Boromir, and Gwaihir for 8 wp).  Market Square is revealed, so no progress makes it to the main quest.  (Actually, knowing it was the last turn I didn't bother clearing the sewers and travelling to Market Square.

Beruthiel engages me again.  I defend with Winged Guardian (destroyed) and keep her engaged (threat 48).

I take traitor undefended and put 3 damage on Theoden.

I take pickpocket undefended and put 1 damage on Dori, Legolas discarded from hand.

Boromir readies (threat 49), Beechbone and Boromir (threat 49) attack the daughter and Beechone takes damage to give her 3 damage -- Daughter destroyed.

At the end of turn the threat is raised to 50 and I threat out.

If I'd remembered Grimbold's ability I could've been only at 46 threat with an empty staging area -- but with two reveals per turn and Theoden having Local Trouble, I don't like my odds of getting the 15 progress I need, especially with two enemies still outstanding and an encounter deck full of nasty engagement effects.  The eagle I really needed in play on turn 8 was Landroval (not in my deck), as Theoden could've taken undefended damage until he died (losing local trouble), then come back to life ready to help Boromir/Beechbone finish off the Daughter.

My next crack at this quest will include Secret Vigil.  Hopefully Support of the Eagles will decide to come out.

## 271 [dalestephenson on June 23, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/241829-the-middle-earth-hero-auction/?do=findComment&comment=2850096)

Tried three more times against Steward's Fear, and none of them got as far as my first attempt.  I'll spare you the complete play-by-play, but here's the place where things went from bad to worse:

Attempt #1 -- This went bad right at the beginning.  My initial hand I didn't like, but my mulligan had great combat potential with a Winged Guardian, a Vassal of the Windlord, and a Support of the Eagles.  No potential questers, though, so I was reliant on my 7-willpower starting hero combo.

In turn #1 that took a hit, as a City Street surged into a Houses of the Dead (empty to 6 threat in 2.5 seconds), so I placed only one progress on Fourth Star instead of clearing it.  In turn 2 I didn't draw a quester, so I played my Eagle combo and sent the same 7 wp.  Meanwhile, the deck revealed Unwelcome discovery (pickpocket), surging into Market Square, no progress and threat raised by 2.

I was doomed at that point, though I staved off location lock for a bit by playing Wait No Longer for two consecutive turns, then managed to actually place progress with Bofur's help (up to 10 willpower questing now).  But out of Wait No Longer, the locations kept coming, and when on Turn 7 even a Gandalf play (14 willpower questing) raised my threat, I gave it up.

Attempt #2 -- This one I was feeling good about this one at the beginning of turn 4:

Threat 28, 2/4 progress on stage one, prisoner in the staging area, no enemies engaged, only storehouse in the staging area.  Boromir has a Gondorian Shield *and* a Support of Eagles on him, with an Eagle of the Misty Mountain and an Honour Guard in play.  I sent 10 willpower to the quest, which would clear my sewers if the encounter deck revealed 5 or less.

City Street came out (2 threat) surging into

Unwelcome Discovery, revealing Zealous Traitor (2 threat) surging into

Unwelcome Discovery, revealing Umbar Assassin (4 threat) surging into

Dunedain Dissident, (3 threat)

Whose stupid idea was it to make Unwelcome Discovery a surge card!  I think Zealous Traitor or Umbar Assassin would be quite enough to reveal on their own.  I take one threat and can't afford to optionally engage both the Traitor and the Assassin.  Then a shadow returns the dissident to staging leaving 9 threat there before the reveal -- by turn 7 I had cleaned up the enemies and had progressed to stage 2 (Unholy Alliance!) but my threat had skyrocketed and a copy of Local Trouble had attached itself to Theoden.   Game over.

Attempt #3 I took an opening hand that had 2x Support of Eagles despite having no actual Eagles in it, believing an Eagle would show up quickly and also thinking Treebeard could be a big asset.  This was probably foolish, since with Treebeard's cost he can't help until stage 3, and given that the other five cards were not immediately useful at all (2x Support of Eagles, Secret Vigil, Book of Eldacar, Stern as Steel).  Still, things weren't so bad at the beginning of turn 3 -- 4/5 progress on Fourth Star, 27 threat, Treebeard now ready, Grimbold and Envoy also out, so a potential for 12 willpower -- but since I still had no defensive help for Boromir, he was getting banged up, and I had two Market squares in staging (6 threat)  and a Bandit still engaged.  I ended up having to use Treebeard's action advantage for defense instead of helping Boromir kill things.  I resorted to Feint and Book of Eldacar for feint -- with the result that when I finally drew an Eagle on turn 6 (Eagle of the Misty Mountains), I couldn't play it.  I managed to clear the sewers that turn (Local Trouble on Theoden, yet again...), but clearing the sewers added a Bandit and Traitor.  With three enemies and Boromir still only at 2 defense, I gambled on taking one of them undefended, and a shadow made it hero-killing.  Even with Local Trouble I'd have to get rid of Dori instead of Theoden, but with Dori & Grimbold gone and no ability to play Eagles of Misty Mountains next turn, I scoop.

I'll give this quest one more shot before dropping to semi-easy.  This deck has good initial questing, but it's not a deck that will ever generate the massive questing necessary to overcome location lock.

Some cards not in my deck or sideboard that I think could potentially help: Landroval (Local Trouble counter), Steward of Orthanc (non-unique 2-wp for 3 resources, with optional card draw -- came out after my deck was built).  Delay the Enemy and a single copy of Keep Watch -- player side quests are beautiful against this quest because progress is otherwise wasted on the first two stages, and this deck can battle quest more easily than willpower quest.

Great write-ups, keep them coming!

You seem to have some threat issues, which makes sense given that it's a Boromir deck that starts at 33. Did you consider Favor of the Valar at all when building? Wastes of Eriador might prove difficult here as well - lots of enemies and an extra treat every other turn. But thankfully no Local Trouble.

I have no plans to do it again anytime seem. I am too busy with other things at the moment. Feel free to run one yourself with my blessing.

I will say though, that while a couple people mentioned they would like me to start another one, I'm not sure everyone here is itching to do it again (still quite a few people haven't done write-ups) and for this kind of thing to work well you need a lot of active participants.

## 274 [dalestephenson on June 24, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/241829-the-middle-earth-hero-auction/?do=findComment&comment=2851340)

Because of the auction I start at 23 instead of 33.  With 27 threat to burn I didn't consider Favor of the Valar and even relegated Secret Vigil to the sideboard.

The funny thing is that the last time I beat Steward's Fear, I did it with a Dori fellowship where Dori and Boromir were in a 33-threat deck -- and the questing heroes for both decks *combined* only amounted to 6 willpower, while this one starts at 7.  However, the access to spirit and leadership gave Boromir readying options without raising threat, plus I had LoGlorfindel and Asfaloth to avoid location lock.

Wastes of Eraidor will be tough, but Dunedain Hunter and especially Wait No Longer will be better there.  There's no less than seven enemies that either surge or have an obnoxious "when revealed" effect, and those are the enemies those two cards love the most.

Thanks. It is true that I need something like 20 players, approximately what you have this time, for having a real discussion around heroes choice. About the one who don't report don't hope too much: many will never post it. So I will not wait for that. When I will have a lot of time I will set up a new thread and see if I can find my 20 players. And because of those who don't play until the end, and since some may want to play stridder I think about putting like among 2.5 heroes per players. This will bring real pressure among the heroes choice.

The final regular attempt at Steward's Fear also failed.

After planning in turn 3, I'd cleared two locations, had a scrap of history in the staging area, two Envoys of Pelargir, a Honor Guard, and a Vassal of the Windlord as allies (Bofur had sadly been discarded to a knife in the back.  Empty staging area, Sewers the active location, 26 threat.  The only fly in the ointment was that I had no defensive buff for Boromir yet, and I had a Lossarnach Bandit engaged -- I'd actually saved Dori the previous turn, but Dori + Boromir is only 5 attack and I needed six to kill him.

I reserved Dori again in turn 3, anticipating the sewers would spawn another enemy, and depending on who came out he could help with killing or defense while my new Vassal would help kill the bandit (I had Gwaihir, so I could get it back).  Another Sewers came out, giving me a second underworld card for the active location -- and they turned out to be another bandit and the Umbar Assassin.  So much for the resources I had saved for Gwaihir.  Since I still had no defensive help for Boromir, I used Dori to help him defend the Assassin, and Honour Guard to take away damage from another defense, then Boromir + Vassal killed the assassin.  Turn 4 starts with 31 threat, 3/4 progress, two enemies engaged that I can't easily kill.

In turn four I get a Winged Guardian out, hoping to relieve some defensive pressure on Boromir.  I save Theoden instead of Dori so I have killing power for the bandit.  This goes a little better, as Lost in the City allows me to pull the surging City Street and add it, better yet it's not an underworld card.  Better yet, the Sewers cleared revealing a prisoner -- with two clues in staging, all I have to do is clear one more location to reach stage 3.

Combat phase I'm able to defend both and kill one of the bandit, but one defense, one attack, and two clue-claiming sends my threat up to 35.

Turn five: 36 threat, 3/4 progress.  I'm able to clear the active location and get to the final phase (Telemnar's Bane), but he's joined by a dissident.  A shadow returns Telemnar's Bane to staging, but Boromir still needs two defenses and helps kill a bandit.

Turn six: 40 threat, 0/15 progress, Telmnar's bane in staging, a Dissident engaged.  I need to kill the bane, so I save Theoden, but that reduces my willpower to 8 (Dori/Boromir/two Envoys/newly played Eagle of Misty Mountains).  Out come a pickpocket and a treachery forcing me to return the Dissident to staging, so I make no progress and my threat rises to 41.  Three enemies, no progress, and I can't do without Boromir's readying.  The pickpocket also discards the Gandalf in my hand that was the only hope of avoiding a threat loss.  I go ahead and kill Telemnar's Bane for revenge and also clean up the pickpocket, but two attacks and two defenses by Boromir raise my threat to 45.

Turn seven: 46 threat, 0/15 progress, Dissident engaged.  I finally draw my Gondorian Shield, but what I really need is the Gandalf the pickpocket discarded.  I send everyone who can quest (11 wp), but the deck fights back with a Market Square, Dissident, and a Zealous Traitor, getting me only to 2/15 progress.   The Zealous Traitor kills off both my envoys, and with three enemies and little progress I just use Boromir for defense and threat out.

## 277 [dalestephenson on June 26, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/241829-the-middle-earth-hero-auction/?do=findComment&comment=2853753)

After that pathetic performance, I decided to drop to semi-easy, starting with 3 extra resources.  My starting hand of two Winged Guardians, an Honour Guard, a Sterner than Steel, Gandla,f and an Envoy didn't thrill me (though in retrospect it probably should've, since the WGs could save me a lot of threat), so I mulliganed and got a Support of the Eagles, a Gondorian Fire, two Gandalfs, Gwiahir, and an Eagles of the Misty Mountains.  I like this, support + Misty can make Boromir very tough.

I draw a Vassal for turn one and am able to play Support of the Eagles, a Vassal of the Windlord, and a Gondorian Fire.  In reaction my last loss, I'm setting up Boromir to kill things instead of just defend them.

I send my heroes (7 wp).  The encounter deck strikes back with an Unwelcome Discovery revealing the Zealous Traitor, and surging into a Local Trouble on Theoden.  That's not optimal, but it allows me to clear the starting location, allowing me to draw a Gathering Information side-quest and revealing another Zealous Traitor.

The two Zealous Traitors kill my Vassal -- probably the best possible time to get these guys with only one cheap ally out, but annoying to lose the +3 attack from support of the eagles.  Using Gondorian Fire allows Boromir enough attack power to kill traitors, and four readies later a damaged Boromir has emptied the field.  No enemies, nothing in staging -- no active location, local trouble on Theoden.

Turn 2: Threat 29, 1/4 progress, no active location.  I draw and play an Eagle of the Misty Mountains, which lets me quest for six while leaving Theoden on the sidelines.  I also played Gather Information, a beautiful thing in a quest where I progress by clearing active locations.  What's not so beautiful is not having a location to clear.

False lead is revealed.

Turn 3: Threat 30, 1/4 progress, no active location.  I draw a Book of Eldacar, I'm saving up for Gwaihir (I want to save Gandalf for the final stage, if possible).

I send the same 6 wp and get a dissident revealed.  Still no location and only 3/4 progress on Gather Info.  I decide to defend with Theoden and use Boromir/Support to kill it, but the Dissident's shadow discards the resources I was saving.  The enemy costs me three threat, thanks to Local Trouble.

Turn 4: Threat 34, 1/4 progress, no active location.  I draw Captain of Gondor and play it on Boromir.

I send the same 6 willpower, this time I get a City Street surging into another dissident.  At last I have a location to clear, and I get Gather Information cleared.  I grab a Gondorian Shield so I can use my Support for it's attack value, since Boromir is banged up.  But with Captain of Gondor I don't need Support to kill this enemy, and Boromir takes it out for another 2 threat.

Turn 5: Threat 37, 1/4 progress, but finally an active location.  I draw Grimbold, play him and the shield.

I can now quest for 8 without Theoden.  Storehouse comes out, City street is cleared.  Good turn.

Turn 6: Threat 38, 2/4 progress.  Draw another shield.

I quest for 8 and a Lost in City allows me to add City Stree to staging.  Storehouse is cleared, travel to city street, and the underworld card revealed is prisoner!  Looking good, aside from my dangerously high threat.

Turn 7: Threat 39, 3/4 progress, active location, empty staging, prisoner in staging.  I draw a Wait No Longer, going to save that for third staging.

I play Gwaihir, which returns my Vassal to play for the turn, then send everybody but Theoden and the vassal (10 wp) -- there's no underworld card, so I'm feeling reasonably safe.  Knife in the back discards Eagles of the Misty Mountains, which is unfortunate, but I clear the final location and reveal the plot -- Poisoned Counsels, raising my threat by 2 every turn.  This is exactly the plot I do not need.  Boromir readies to interrogate the prisoner.

Turn 8: Threat 43, 2/4 progress.  I draw Eagles are Coming and pull in another Eagles of the Misty Mountains -- I play Gandalf (threat 38) so that I can have the willpower I need to clear Mindoullin, sending Gwaihir, Gandalf, Grimbold, and Dori -- Boromir reserved for defense, Theoden unusable thanks to Local trouble. A Dissident comes out and the active location is cleared (3/4), but I have no new location to travel to and two enemies to deal with -- Mindoullin revealed a pickpocket.  I take the pickpocket undefended, but Boromir defending against dissident and then killing both enemies sends threat to 40.  And the plot kicks in...

Turn 9: Threat 43, 3/4 progress, no active location.  I draw Sterner than Steel.  I only send Gwaihir and Grimbold (4 willpower), since there's nothing to clear.  False lead ends it.

Turn 10: Threat 46, 3/4 progress, no active location.  I draw Feint, I play my other Gandalf to reduce my threat (41), though in retrospect I should've saved him for the next turn.  I only send Gwaihir and Grimbold (4 willpower), and this time I finally get a location.  I travel to the sewers.

Turn 11: Threat 44, 3/4 progress, finally have an active location, but no real hope of completing the third stage.  I draw and play Book of Eldcar, send Dori/Grimbold/Gwaihir (6 wp), a Dissident is revealed and the Sewers are cleared -- Bandit to staging, and stage 3 brings out Hand of Castimir.  Since I'm doomed anyway, I want to take the villain with me.  I use Feint to keep Castimir from attacking, use the Book to replay Feint against the bandit, and take the dissident's attack undefended.  Then Boromir and Theoden (45) kill Castimir, Boromir (46) kills the bandit, Boromir (47) kills the dissident, and then the plot, the end of round, and Local Trouble send me to 51 and I threat out again.

I might've been able to pull this out with a different plot, but all those turns with no active location to clear ultimately sent my threat to unsustainable levels.  Local Trouble on Theoden really would've hurt in stage three, but as it turns out I never really got to that point.

And the final go against Steward's Fear, in semi-easy (extra resource) mode....

Initial hand was Sterner Than Steel, Gandalf, Treebeard, Vassal of the Windlord, Gondorian Shield, and Wait No Longer.  With six resources, this hand is a a no brainer.  I take it and draw a second Gondorian Shield, and play Treebeard and a Shield.

I send all three heroes (7 wp).  A City street surges into a False lead, ending the quest phase

Turn 2: Threat 24, 0/4 progress stage one.  I draw a Winged Guardian and play it.  My achilles heel in previous games has been threat, but alternatives to Boromir for defense will help a lot with that -- as will having Treebeard around to help attack.

With extra threat in staging, I send Treebeard and all heroes for 9 willpower.  A Dissident comes up, allowing me to place 4 progress on Fourth Star.

I engage the Dissident and defend with Winged Guardian, but the shadow returns it to staging.

Turn 3: Threat 25, 0/4 progress stage one.  I draw and play an Eagle of the Misty Mountains.

Treebeard has two resources now and can self-ready, and my threat in staging is getting bigger.  I send everybody but the WG for 11 willpower.  A Storehouse is revealed, allowing the Fourth Star to be cleared (1/4).  My notes don't mention the draw, maybe I forgot it, but it did reveal an Umbar Assassin.  I travel to the City Street, engage the Assassin (damage on Theoden) and Dissident, and put one damage from archery on Treebeard and Misty.  I defend the Assassin with WG, he's destroyed and buffs Misty to 3/3 attack/defense.  Boromir readies (26) and defends against Dissident, using Stern as Steel to cancel a shadow that would've discarded my whole hand.  Then Boromir (27) and Treebeard (self-ready) destroy the Assassin.

Turn 4: Threat 28, 1/4 progress stage one.  I draw Wait no Longer, play Vassal of the Windlord.

Treebeard can't ready and is still more dangerous than Misty, so I send the heroes + Misty for 9 willpower.  False lead is revealed and ends the quest phase.

I defend the Dissident with Vassal of the Windlord (destroyed), buffing Misty to 4/4 attack/defense.  Treebeard then kills him.

Turn 5: Threat 29, 1/4 progress stage one.  Draw and play Honour Guard.

I send the heroes + Treebeard for 9 willpower.  An Unwelcome discovery discards a secret map and surges into a sewers (adding an underworld card to City Street).  I clear City Street (2/4), revealing a zealous traitor.  I travel to Sewers.

The Traitor damages Honour Guard and Treebeard, Honour Guard exhausts to avoid damaging Misty.  Misty defends against the traitor, Treebeard self-readies and kills him.

Turn 6: Threat 30, 2/4 progress stage one.  Draw and play Bofur.

With only storehouse in the  staging area, I think the heroes + Bofur (9 willpower) can clear sewers, then Misty and Treebeard can take the underwolrd card down.  Lurking in Shadows surges into an Underworld Dissident, the Sewers are cleared (3/4), and pickpocket is revealed.  I travel to the Storehouse.

I take the pickpocket undefended, he discards my Wait No Longer and the Honour Guard exhausts to prevent his damage.  Misty defends against the Dissident.  Boromir readies (31) to kill the pickpocket, Treebeard kills the Dissident.

Turn 7: Threat 32, 3/4 progress stage one.  Draw & play winged Guardian

With an empty staging area I send the heroes + Bofur (9 willpower).  Out comes a Market Square, allowing the storehouse to be cleared (4/4) and revealing a pickpocket.  The Plot is Up in Flames, the deck-discarding plot that poses little threat to this slow-drawing deck -- if I can encounter enough locations to get through the second stage in a timely fashion.  Misty defends the pickpocket, again discarding a wait no Longer, then Treebeard kills him.

Turn 8: Threat 33, 0/4 progress stage two.  Draw a Gondorian Shield.

I send the heroes, Bofur, and Treebeard for 11 willpower.  Market square is revealed, allowing Roots to be cleared and revealing another pickpocket.  I travel to one of the Market Squares.  Winged Guardian defends against the pickpocket (Gondorian Shield discarded) and Misty kills him.

Turn 9: Threat 34, 1/4 progress stage two.  Draw and play a Book of Eldacar -- if the plot discards a Feint from my deck, I can play it and put it on the bottom of my deck.  I send the heroes, Bofur, and Treebeard for 11 willpower.  Houses of the Dead comes out, I clear the market square (2/2), and travel to the Houses of the Dead exhausting my remaining characters-- with no enemies engaged or in staging, I don't have to either use Boromir or Treebeard's self-readying to cover me.

Turn 10: Threat 35, 2/4 progress stage two.  Draw a Feint.

Wanting to be sure of clearing the stage, and with two Feint plays available and WG, I send Misty and Treebeard with Bofur and the heroes for 13 willpower.  Out comes Local Trouble -- it just wouldn't be Steward's Fear without Local Trouble on Theoden.  We clear houses of the dead (3/4), and the underworld cards are a Zealous Traitor and a scrap of history.  I ready Boromir (36) and claim the Scrap of History to finish the second stage, revealed is the hand of Castimir.  Sadly with Misty questing I can't kill him this turn.  I travel to Market Square, engage the traitor (Honour Guard saves the Winged Guardian, all the other allies have hp remaining).  WG defends against Castimir, Boromir readies (37) and defends against the Traitor.  Treebeard readies and kills the traitor, Treebeard readies again, as does Boromir (38), and together they put 4 damage on Castimir.

Turn 11: Threat 40, 0/15 progress stage three.  Castimir 4/6 damage.  I draw and play a Vassal of the Windlord, also play Gandalf and use him for threat reduction (35 threat).

I send everybody -- all heroes (36), Gandalf, Bofur, Treebeard, and Misty, for 17 willpower.  A storehouse comes out for 2 threat, but with Market Square taking one progress I only have 14/15 progress on the main quest.  I travel to the Storehouse, Feint Castimir, then Treebeard does his final readying and finishes off Castimir with the help of the Vassal (Vassal discarded to Misty, buffing her to 5/5 attack/defense).

Turn 12: Threat 38, 14/15 progress, storehouse active location, empty staging area.  Draw and play Honour Guard.

The game is now in the bag.  I again send all heroes (39) plus Treebeard and Bofur for 11 wp.  Misty stays back for defense, not that we'll get that far.  The encounter deck strikes back by revealing -- a Prisoner.  Victory!  At last.

I'm glad not to have to go against Steward's Fear again.  After taking six plays, and an easier mode to knock of the "medium" quest, next stop is the hard quest.  The key to victory was minimizing Boromir readying, he only raised threat to defend twice and only raise threat to attack twice; the Eagles and Treebeard managed to take care of most of the combat.  If it weren't for local trouble I would've ended the game at 36 threat.  But it also helped that I finally got the plot that by far is the easiest for this deck to beat.

I Will do it soon, was waiting for my copy of the Mumakil to arrive (it arrived about a week ago). 

## 280 [dalestephenson on July 4, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/241829-the-middle-earth-hero-auction/?do=findComment&comment=2864869)

The Wastes of Eriador -- the hard quest.  I know from Steward's Fear that threat is likely to be a problem.  I also need to be able to not just defend, but actually kill things.

Finally, Cold From Angmar can devastate me -- so I need to keep damage off Theoden and Boromir at all costs.  My initial mulligan targets at Honour Guard and Gondorian Shield.  On the plus side, Wait No Longer and Dunedain Hunter actually do work well in this quest.

But nothing ventured, nothing gained -- into the wastes we go -- and it might have worked if less wolves came out of the deck.

My opening hand was Treebeard, Dunedain Hunter, Winged Guardian, Envoy of Pelargir, Gandalf, and a Sterner than Steel.  I love Treebeard, but he's slow to come on board and using him as a damage sink is less compelling when it nerfs his resource gathering and self-readying.  I mulligan into Winged Guardian, Support of the Eagles, Gondorian Fire, Dunedain Hunter, Gwaihir, and Legolas.  So I didn't get my key cards, but WG + Support turns Boromir into a 6-defense defender, so I like the potential here.  Setup also reveals a Rugged Country in staging.

Turn 1: 23 threat, 0/20 progress 1B.

I draw Secret Vigil.  I play Dunedain Hunter and find a White Warg, placing its when-engaged damage on the Hunter.  I play the Vigil on the Warg, Winged Guardian, and Gondorian Fire.  Facing one enemy already, I hope another doesn't come out so I can save my Winged Guardian for the Support of the Eagles.  I send the three heroes and save Amarthiul, due to daytime that gives me 10 willpower.  Out comes a Cold From Angmar, I attach it to stage 1B and damage Dori.  This gives enough progress to clear the starting active location and place three progress on 1B.  I travel to Rugged Country.

In the combat phase, Amarthiul defends, and then Boromir (24 threat) and Dunedain Hunter combine to finish it off, the Secret Vigil reducing my threat to 22.  Night falls (23 threat), and a Northern Warg is revealed, fortunately it's "when revealed" threat enhancement will wear off for the next quest phase.

Turn 2: 25 threat, 3/20 progress 1B.

I draw another Secret Vigil, but use my resources to play Support of the Eagles on Boromir.  If I can keep the WG alive, Boromir can defend for 6 now.

At night I can't make progress on the quest, but I can at least clear active locations.  Still, I need to keep the wolves under control so I just send the three heroes (7 willpower) again.  A Hunting Pack (4 threat) is revealed, so I'm one short of clearing Rugged Country. Neither wolf will automatically engage me, I optionally engage the Northern Warg, defend with Boromir (25 threat) and kill it with Amarthiul and the Hunter.

Turn 3: 26 threat, 3/20 progress 1 B.

I draw Wait no Longer, and decide to play it so I can be sure to clear the active location and make progress.  It pulls a White Warg out of the deck, I place the damage on the Hunter.

I send the heroes and the Hunter (11 wp) to clear Rugged Country and get progress to 10/20.  Boromir (27 threat) defends, then Boromir (28 threat) and Amarthiul kill the White Warg.

Night sends threat to 29 and reveals another Cold from Angmar -- I damage Dori again.

Turn 4: 30 threat, 10/20 progress 1B.

I draw Close Call (I put this back in my deck because I had to avoid damage on Boromir -- but given the threat situation am unlikely to use it).  I play Legolas.  I send only Theoden and Dori for 5 willpower.  Predatory Wolves comes out and a White Warg comes out.  I optionally engage the pack and put the White Warg's damage on poor Dori.  Boromir defends the pack and then defends (threat 31) the Warg -- maybe I should've saved a resource to actually use the Winged Guardian.  I want to finish the pack off, so Boromir (threat 32), Legolas, and Amarthiul kill it, Legolas' ability pulling up another Dunedain Hunter.  Boromir (threat 33) and the existing Hunter polish off the Warg.

Turn 5: 34 threat, 10/20 progess 1B.

I draw Treebeard and play my new Dunedain Hunter, which finds a Wolf of Angmar.  With only 1 threat I don't want to waste my Secret Vigil on him, so I send the heroes and both Hunters (12 willpower).  Out comes Pressing Needs (36 threat) which forces me to choose a reveal a side quest.  Make Camp doesn't hurt me, since I can't heal anyway, but it surges and if I pick Lost in the Wilderness I can finish off this stage.  I decide to press forward, picking Lost in the Wilderness and losing my hand:  Secret Vigil, Gwiahir, Close Call, Treebeard.  Stage 2A is revealed, adding a Northern Warg.  With the Hunters both questing, I need Boromir to kill both wolves, but the Winged Guardian should be able to take a defense.  I ready Boromir (37 threat) and defend the Northern Warg; the shadow makes me exhaust a character, I choose the Winged Guardian to keep my killing intact, but Boromir (38 threat) has to defend it too.  Boromir  (39 threat)  + Amarthiul kill the wolf, Boromir (40 threat) + Legolas kill the warg and I draw Bofur.  (Note -- I screwed up updating my threat counter, so I *thought* I had 37 threat at this point -- I missed the "doomed 2" from the event and one of the Night increments.)

The good news is that Night no longer boosts my threat; the bad news is that it's now taking out my allies.  I discard the damaged  Dunedain Hunter.

Turn 6: 41 threat, 0/15 progress 2B

I draw the completely useless Close call, and play Bofur.  With an empty stage but not being able to afford lack of progress, I send Dori, Theoden, and Bofur for 7 willpower.  A Wolf of Angmar surges into a White Wolf -- just what I need, two more enemies.

Boromir defends the wolf, Winged Guardian defends the warg but the shadow forces me to exhaust the Hunter.  Now I need Boromir for both killings and he obliges (42 threat, 43 threat), drawing Grimbold.  Daybreak causes me to draw an Eagles are Coming.

Turn 7: 44 threat, 0/15 progress 2B

I draw a second Eagles are coming.  I could really use some expendable Eagles right now, so I play both copies.  One whiffs, the other pulls in another Winged Guardian.  I play the Winged Guardian and Grimbold.  Maybe Boromir won't have to defend.  But I need to make progress, so I send all heroes with Grimbold and Bofur (11 willpower) against an empty staging.  Biting wind comes out to place 5 damage, I make Grimbold, Bofur and Dori go within a point of death, clear the active location and make 8/15 progress.  When night comes I discard the Winged Guardian (thinking I only needed one -- what was I thinking?), and night reveals a Northern Warg.

Turn 8: 45 threat, 8/15 progress 2B

I draw a Dunedain Hunter and play it to get a Blood Thirsty Warg.  With just Northern Warg in stagingI,  save Theoden for extra attacking and quest with Dori/Bofur/Grimbold (6 willpower).   North Downs is revealed and I travel there.

I defend with Boromir against the Blood-Thirsty Warg -- would be nice to have two Winged Guardians about now!  The shadow gets an Angmar wolf out of the stack, so I defend with Boromir (46 threat) against that as well.  An additional attack (47 threat) is defended with Boromir.  Winged Guardian takes the final wolf, but the shadow card kills it -- Boromir's Support of the Eagles is now worthless.

I think my threat is only 44, not 47, so I ready Boromir three times to finish off all three wolves with the help of Hunter/Amarthiul/Legolas, and draw Gandalf.  Just what I need!  Since it was night I couldn't really have saved 1 threat by taking an undefended attack, but I could've and should've used a Winged Guardian along the way to save a Boromir ready.

Turn 9:  Think my threat is 48, draw an Honour Guard.

Play Gandalf, think my threat is 43. I need to clear this stage and get the boss out.  I send Gandalf, Grimbold, Bofur and the heroes for 15 progress, I need 11 progress so 4 can come out of the encounter deck.  A White Warg comes out, so I clear the North downs and finish the stage.  The Pack Leader is added and it automatically flips to night, revealing a North Downs -- I don't travel to it because I need to get all 5 progress next turn.  Both wolves are coming, I ready Boromir (44 threat) so I can exhaust him for the Pack Leaders effect with one of the hunters.  Amarthiul defends the White Warg, the Hunter is the sacrificial victim and is destroyed by the Pack Leader.  Legolas and Boromir (45 threat) kill the warg, drawing Eagles of the Misty Mountains.

Turn 10: Think my threat is 46, 0/5 progress stage 3B

I draw Book of Eldacar, and I play Eagles of the Misty Mountains.  I can't afford to use Book/EAC to get another eagle.  I *must* get 5 progress this time, and because it's daytime I have only 5 threat in staging.  I send the heroes and Grimbold, Misty, Bofur for 13 willpower.  I am saving Amarthiul and Legolas for attacking, despite the fact that I *cannot* attack the Pack Leader this turn and have no other wolves in play.  Out comes a Northern Warg, which boosts the Pack Leader's threat as well as himself and I make ... 4 progress.  I travel to the Northern Downs, but that's effectively game over....

Boromir defends (47 threat), and without a WG in play takes one damge.  Amarthiul and Legolas kill it, drawing a Support of the Eagles.

Night reveals a shrouded hills.

Turn 11: Think my threat is 48, 4/5 progress.  If this had really been my threat, and I had put down one more progress last time, then I would be very close to winning -- only one wolf in play, so all my remaining attackers could take out the Pack Leader.  I have two expendable heroes to take undefended attacks, even.  I play Support of the Eagles so I can boost Boromir twice.  I send Bofur, Misty, Grimbold and both non-Boromir heroes for 11 willpower.  Out comes a Wolf of Angmar surging into a Predatory Wolves -- Game over.  *If* I had 5/5 progress, and *if* I hadn't got yet more wolves from the encounter deck, I could've exhausted Boromir, took an undefended attack, then Boromir + 2 support Eagles + Legolas + Amarthiul could've combined for 13 attack and taken the Pack Leader down.

So close, or so I thought at the time.  It's not nice of the stages to keep shuffling those defeated wolves back into the deck.  I killed 14 wolves in ten turns, none of which could be killed by any one character, and while I pulled 4 of those out of the deck with Hunter/Wait No Longer, in an ordinary quest that would've kept them from being encountered during the quest stage.   I really think this quest didn't need to make Wolf of Angmar a surger -- requiring 4 attack to kill and attacking for 4 at night, he's sufficiently tough without pulling yet another wolf out of the bag.  Whatever happened to surge enemies that Thalin could one-shot?

Attempt #2 at Wastes of Eraidor was short and sweet.  Well, short.

 

I kept my original hand: Gondorian Shield, Gandalf, Vassal of the Windlord, Support of the Eagles, Winged Guardian, Eagles of the Misty Mountains.  I've got defense, offense, and a threat reducer -- all I need now is for the encounter deck to give me time to set it all up.  A forlorn hope.

Setup for the encounter deck had two Weight of Responsibility (replacing themselves) bring out a Wolf of Angmar which surged into a Blood-Thirsty warg.  So turn one starts with two wolves and 3 threat in staging.

Turn 1 (23 threat) 0/20 progress.  I draw a second Eagle of the Misty Mountains and play my Winged Guardian, reserving a resource for him to defend.  I can only take one wolf, and I'm going to take blood-thirsty warg to avoid his immediate attack from night.  I'm trying to minimize defenses from Boromir to preserve threat, and since I didn't play the Shield he can't defend safely anyway.

I send my heroes for 10 willpower.  The deck reveals a Hunting Pack, so I place 4 progress on shrouded hills.  I engaged the blood-thirsty warg, defend with the winged guardian, and attack with Amarthiul -- it only does 1 damage, but that gets him to the point where he can be killed with 6 attack.

Night falls (24 threat) and reveals a Northern Downs.

Turn 2 (25 threat) 0/20 stage 1B, 6 threat in staging.

I draw Grimbold, but play Support of Eagles.  Needing at least two defenses this turn, Boromir needs a higher defense.  I probably should've played the Shield so that Winged Guardian could take a defense, since Support means I can't defend with WG without losing him.

I send my heroes (7 willpower), and out comes a Northern Warg, boosting the other two wolves threat and raising my threat to 29.  No travel for me!

I engage two of the wolves, leaving the tough pack in staging.  I exhaust support of eagles to boost Boromir's defense to 6.

Boromir (30 threat) defends the Blood-Thirsty Warg

Boromir (31 threat) defends the Northern Warg -- and the shadow gives me another Northern Warg engaged

Boromir (32 threat) defends the new Northern Warg

Boromir (33 threat) defends the Wolf of Angmar

Boromir (34 threat) and Amarthiul kill the Blood-Thirsty Warg.

Day comes and I forget to send the three remaining wolves back to staging, so I think I have only 4 threat there instead of 9 threat.

Turn 3: 35 threat, 0/20 progress 1B, 4 threat (should be 9) in staging.

I Draw Secret Vigil, play on a Northern Warg, then play Vassal of the Windlord and the Gondorian Shield.  With 3 wolves engaged instead of the zero it should be, I plan to kill off all the wolves except the pack.

I send my heroes for 10 willpower, the deck counters with Wolf of Angmar, which surges into a Wolf's Den.  I thought that gave me one progress (should've been threat raise of 4), clearing Shrouded Hills and traveling to North Downs.  I optionally engage the Wolf of Angmar, wanting to clear the wolves out.  Once again I have no resources for WG, but Vigil will buy me two Boromir readies.  I exhaust Support of Eagles to use the Vassal's attack.

I take one Wolf of Angmar undefended since it's daytime, and put two damage on Dori.

Amarthiul blocks the second wolf of Angmar, the shadow exhausting my WG.

Boromir (36 threat) defends Northern Warg #1, the shadow puts a Blood-Thirsty Warg engaged with me.

Boromir (37 threat) defends Northern Warg #2, the shadow puts one damage on Boromir.

Boromir (38 threat) defends Blood-Thirsty, the shadow exhausts my Vassal.

Boromir (39-42 threat) readies to kill four wolves, all but Blood-Thirsty who needs 7 attack.  The Vigil reduces threat to 40.

Night comes (41 threat) and reveals a Northern Warg.

So at the beginning of turn 4, I have 0/20 progress on the first stage, 42 threat, an engaged Blood-Thirsty Warg, two wolves (and 9 threat) in staging.  With Gondorian Shield and Support/Vassal, Boromir can safely defend and kill the lesser wolves, but my threat is high enough I'll be seeing the pack this turn, and I have no real hope of questing successfully.  I concede because it was still early enough to attempt try #3, or so I thought.

If I had followed the rules correctly turn 3 would've gone differently -- but the threat in staging would've been much larger and even with playing Grimbold I would've taken on more threat.  The quest gave me seven wolves in three turns, and that was just too much to overcome.  Wolf of Angmar is way too strong to be a surge card.

## 282 [dalestephenson on July 5, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/241829-the-middle-earth-hero-auction/?do=findComment&comment=2867013)

Having quickly lost one game, I tried to squeeze in another before going to bed.  Naturally it turned out to be the longest attempt yet.

My Original hand was 2x Support of Eagles, 2 x Sterner than Steel, a Book of Eldacar, and an Honour Guard.  Two Supports with no eagles isn't very useful, and the other four cards aren't immediately useful either.  I mulligan.

Second hand is Gather Information, Sterner than Steel, two Gandalfs, Eagles are Coming, and a Support of the Eagles.  Much better.

Setup reveals a Rugged Country, but I'm unlikely to play Gather Info anytime soon.  Pity night doesn't just prevent main quest progress.

Turn 1: 23 threat, 0/20 progress 1B

I draw a Dunedain Hunter, and my EAC pulls in a Winged Guardian.  I play Dunedain Hunter, pulling in a Blood-Thirsty Warg.  I play the Winged Guardian.

I send the heroes questing (10 wp), it reveals the Make Camp sidequest (prevents me from healing) and surges into North Downs.  With 3 threat versus 10 willpower I clear the starting location and get 2/20 progress, traveling to North Downs before night bumps its threat up.

In the combat phase I defend with Amarthiul, but the shadow damages him.  Boromir (24 threat) and Hunter kill the warg -- the two combine for 7 attack, so I either made a mistake here or wrote down the wrong kind of warg for the Hunter.  I prefer the Dunedain Hunter to grab Wolf of Angmar first (avoid the surge) and Northern Warg second (avoid threat increase) -- Blood-Thirsty is the next-to-last choice.

Night falls (25 threat), and Predatory Wolves I choose to reveal a Northern Warg (avoiding threat increase)

Turn 2: Threat 26, 2/20 progress 1B, 4 threat in staging.

I draw Legolas, and play Support of Eagles on Boromir.  I can now defend for 6 with Boromir, and have a resource left to pay for WG or to save up for Legolas.

I send the heroes (7 willpower), a shrouded hills is revealed, so I only place 1 progress on North Downs.  I engage the Northern Warg.

Boromir (27 threat) defends, but the shadow tosses the support of Eagles.  I think I screwed up here, I had already exhausted Support so Boromir's defense should have stayed at six.  instead I give Boromir one damage from the attack.

Amarthiul and the Hunter kill the warg.

Turn 3: Threat 28, 2/20 progress 1B, 4 threat in staging.

I draw Beechbone and play him.

I send the heroes + Amarthiul (11 willpower).  The deck counters with a Wolf of Angmar surging into a North downs, so with 5 progress I clear North Downs and get to 4/20 progress.  I travel to the new North Downs.

I engage the Wolf of Angmar, and defend with Winged Guardian, using my last resource to retain him.  Boromir (29 threat) and the Hunter kill it.

Night falls (30 threat) and a Hunting Pack comes out.

Turn 4: Threat 31, 4/20 progress 1B, 7 threat in staging.

I draw Eagles of Misty Mountains and send my heroes + Beechbone (9 willpower).  Cold from Angmar comes out and attaches itself to the main quest -- Boromir's one damage (incorrectly applied) has just nerfed him.  On the plus side, this should slow down my threat....  I give the Cold damage to Dori.  Without Boromir's readying ability and the Support of Eagles, I can't defend and kill the pack so I leave it in staging.  North Downs has 2/4 progress now.

Turn 5: Threat 32, 4/20 progress 1B, 7 threat in staging.

I draw Grimbold, and play Eagles of the Misty Mountains.

I send Misty, the heroes, and Beechbone for 14 willpower.  A Biting Wind is reveal and I damage Beechbone and Dori.  We clear the Downs and go to 7/20 progress, and Travel to Rugged Country.

Night falls (33 threat), and a Northern Warg comes out.

Turn 6: Threat 34, 7/20 progress 1B, 7 threat in staging.

I draw another Eagles of the Misty Mountains, and I play Grimbold.

I send my heroes, Beechbone, Misty, and Grimbold for 13 willpower.  The deck reveals a Blood-Thirsty Warg, so we're able to clear Rugged Country and travel to Shrouded Hills.  Lacking defensive options, I  engage the Northern Warg and leave the other two in staging.  Winged Guardian defends, but the shadow exhausts Amarthiul and I can't kill it; Hunter does 2 damage to it.

Turn 7: Threat 35, 7/20 progress 1B, and once again I forget to return my engage wolf to staging.  So I think there's only 5 threat there  instead of 7.  (Of course, if it hadn't been for incorrectly damaging Boromir in the first place, the wolf would be dead.) I've got to get through 1B to discard the treachery and get Boromir healthy again.  I draw EAC, get a Vassal and play it.  I send 16 willpower (Heroes + Beechbone + Misty + Grimbold).  The quest reveals Pressing Need (37 threat), which causes me to switch to Make Camp -- and with 11 progress I clear shrouded hills and also Make Camp, healing Boromir and making him ready-capable again.  If only he had Support of the Eagles still!

I engage the Blood thirsty wargs and defend with Guardian Eagle -- the shadow boost attacks and killing it, boosting Misty to 3/3.  Amarthiul defends the Northern Warg, but the shadow brings into play Wolf of Angmar.  Boromir (38 threat) defends against the new wolf, since it's daytime he may come out unscathed and does.  The Hunter finishes off the damaged Northern Warg, Boromir (39 threat) and the Vassal kill the Wolf of Angmar, the Vassal goes away making Misty 4/4.

Night falls (40 threat) and Weight of Responsibility causes another Hunting Pack to come out.  Ugh.

Turn 8: 41 threat, 7/20 progress 1B, 6 threat (two Hunting Packs) in staging.

I draw Wait No Longer and play Gandalf, reducing threat to 36.   I send Grimbold, the heroes, and Beechbone for 11 willpower; Gandalf will defend for me and hopefully get damaged to prevent him going away.  A Warg Den comes out.  I engage one of the Pack (I still can't safely defend with Boromir).  Gandalf defends the Pack and takes 2 damage.  Misty defends against Blood-Thirsty.  Boromir (37 threat) + Hunter + Amarthiul destroy the pack.

Turn 9: 38 threat, 7/20 progress 1B.  I think there's 7 threat (Wolf's Den + Hunting Pack) in staging, but the Blood-thirsty Warg should've been in staging.  I'm again forgetting to return engaged enemies in daytime.

I draw a Book of Eldacar and play Legolas.  I send the Heroes, Gandalf, Beechbone, and Grimbold for 18 willpower, the deck counters with Eriador Waste, limiting my progress placed to 5, 12/20 progress.  I travel to the Wastes and engage the pack for its travel effect.

I discard Grimbold to prevent the pack from attacking, since I can't defend it without taking damage.  Misty defends against Blood-Thirsty, but the shadow gives Misty 1 damage, blanking his attack/defense boost and causing 2 more damage to get through.

Boromir (39 threat) + Amarthiul + Hunter kill the pack, and Boromir (40 threat) + Legolas kill Blood-Thirsty, drawing another copy of Wait No Longer.

Night falls (41 threat), revealing a White Warg.

Turn 10: 42 threat, 12/20 progress 1B.  There's 6 threat in staging.  I draw Gwaihir but can't afford him.

I send the heroes, Misty, and Beechbone for 11 willpower.  Freezing Blast (44 threat) counters by taking Dori and Misty and Beechbone off the quest, leaving me with only 5 willpower and increasing my threat to 45.  I engage the White Warg, damaging Hunter, Gandalf defends and Legolas/Hunter kill it, drawing an Envoy of Pelrigir.

Turn 11: 46 threat, 12/20 progress, 4 threat in staging.  Without the Gandalf on the field going away and the Gandalf in my hand coming in, I'll threat out soon.  I draw another Sterner than Steel, useless without Gondorian Shield.  I play the Envoy and another Eagle of the Misty Mountains -- I've screwed up my threat accounting and think I'm at 44, so I think I could potentially save enough for Gandalf play on Turn 13.

I send Gandalf, both Misties, Beechbone, Envoy and the heroes for 21 willpower, a Rugged Country comes out and I finally clear stage 1B.  Cold from Angmar goes away, my Misty is 4/4 again and Gandalf is temporary again.  A White Warg comes out for 2A's effect, I travel to Wolf's Den engaging a Northern Warg, then optionally engage the Northern Warg, damaging Gandalf.

Boromir (47 threat) defends Northern Warg, and Amarthiul defends the White Warg.  Boromir (48 threat)  and Legolas kill the White Warg, Boromir (49 threat) and Hunter kill the Northern Warg.

This ensures that I'll threat out, but I *thought* my threat was 2 lower than it really was, otherwise I wouldn't have traveled to Wolf's Den at all despite its 4 threat.  Night makes me discard an ally (I choose Gandalf, of course), and a Wolf of Angmar surges into the harmless (right now) Biting Wind.

Thinking I had 48 threat, I just needed to avoid threat increase in Turn 12 and I could play Gandalf in Turn 13, lower threat, and quest hard.  But the next encounter card was Freezing Blast, which raised my threat by two and caused me to threat out.

So a long fruitless quest marred by several rules mistakes.  Having Boromir unavailable for readying saved my threat for a while, but the lack of Boromir readying meant trouble killing the wolves.  In the end I was doomed yet again.

Do you plan on more attempts in standard mode, or are you thinking about moving to sleazy/easy?

I was going to move to semi-easy, but with all the rules mistakes I made in the last two attempts I think I'll take one more regular shot.  I don't have high hopes, though.  My thought when putting the deck together was that the lower starting threat would let me do Super-Boromir, and I just needed to tread water until Boromir was set up, for this quest that's definitely not the case -- and as awesome as Support the Eagles is once the eagles are up and running, Eagles and the attachment itself are expensive, and just can't come on line quickly -- at least until I start the scenario with 6 resources instead of 3!  I think the deck would be better off with no eagles and more traditional tactics fighters and defenders, plus three copies of the new Steward of Orthanc.

Though when the wolves come thick and fast, it's hard not to be overwhelmed.  Even making the surging Wolf of Angmar require 3 attack instead of 4 to kill would help a lot.

## 285 [dalestephenson on July 7, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/241829-the-middle-earth-hero-auction/?do=findComment&comment=2870314)

The last try on regular against Wastes of Eriador -- will it go any better than the earlier tries?

My initial hand has Sterner than Steel, Secret Vigil, Feint, Honour Guard, Eagles of the Misty Mountains, and The Eagles are Coming.  it's not bad, but I want something immediately useful for defense and don't want to gamble with EAC.  So I mulligan.

The mulligan hand has Sterner than Steel, Secret Vigil, Feint, Dunedain Hunter, Vassal of the Windlord, and Winged Guardian.  Much the same hand, but with the WG in hand I have a 4-defense option, albeit an expensive one.

The encounter deck reveals a Northern Warg for setup, so once again I will have to deal with enemies right away.

Turn 1: 23 threat, 0/20 1B, 2 threat in staging.

I play my Dunedain Hunter hoping to draw the surging wolf out of the deck, but it gets another Northern Warg -- that's my second favorite to pull since it avoids the "When revealed" effect.  I could play my Winged Guardian here, but using it would leave me with no resources.  I instead put a Secret Vigil on the Warg in staging, which will let me leave it there for a while (now 1 threat) and eventually lower my threat.  Amarthiul can defend the existing wolf and Boromir + Hunter can kill it.

I send my heroes questing for 10 willpower.  The encounter deck responds with Weight of Responsibility, which brings out White Warg.  Two enemies after all, but I clear Shrouded Hills and place 2 progress on the main quest.

I engage the White Warg and place damage on Dori.  I'm going to have to gamble and defend the White Warg with Boromir, hoping the shadow doesn't damage him and make him vulnerable to Cold from Angmar.  Amarthiul and Boromir manage to defend without damage, then Boromir + Hunter kill the White Warg, and Boromir readies again to damage the Northern warg.  I hate to run up threat like this in turn one, but it's the only wolf that can be killed with two 3-strength attacks.  If I don't have more wolves come out, Amarthiul + Hunter can dispose of it next turn without Boromir's help.

Night comes and reveals Eriador Wastes.

Turn 2: 28 threat, 2/20 1B, 4 threat in staging.

I draw Bofur and play Bofur -- I want to travel to Eriador Wastes this turn but that means two wargs, and having Bofur available can free Boromir from questing duty.

I send Bofur/Theoden/Dori for 7 willpower.  The deck counters with Biting Wind (damage to questers equal to number of questers) and I damage Bofur and poor Dori -- Theoden *must* be free of damage to survive Cold From Angmar.  I quest successfully and travel to Wastes of Eriador, which causes me to engage the warg in staging and deal it a shadow card.

With two wargs to deal with, and one of them having two shadow cards, this seems a good time to use my Feint.  I Feint the two-shadow wolf and Amarthiul successfully defends the other.  Boromir and Hunter kill the Warg with secret Vigil, reducing my threat to 26.  Then Boromir readies (threat 27) to finish off the other warg.

I'm feeling pretty good about this start -- no engaged wolves, nothing in staging, threat not out of control yet.  Time to make some progress.

Turn 3: 28 threat, 2/20 1B, empty staging

I draw Honour Guard, but I play Winged Guardian and save my other two resources.  Boromir can't safely defend, and if I can defend a new wolf with WG Amarthiul + Hunter can probably kill it.  I need Boromir for questing.

I send the heroes + Bofur (12 willpower).  The deck counters with Predatory wolves, which I convert into a Northern Warg rather than discard Bofur.  That allows me to clear Eriador Wastes and place 4 more progress on the main quest.

In the combat phase, Winged Guardian successfully defends the warg, then Amarthiul + Hunter kill it.

Night falls (29 threat) and a Freezing Blast comes out -- it's a good time since it affects questing, though it does bump my threat to 31.

Turn 4: 32 threat, 6/20 1B, empty staging

I draw Wait No Longer and play my Honour Guard.

I send Bofur/Theoden/Dori for 7 willpower, with an empty staging that should be plenty to avoid threat increase.  The deck counters with the obnoxious Cold From Angmar.  I exhaust Honour Guard to prevent the hero damage, but now I certainly can't take risks with Boromir.

Turn 5: 33 threat, 6/20 1B, empty staging

I draw Wait no Longer, and play a second Winged Guardian and a Vassal of the Windlord.  They don't serve an immediate need, but will be handy when stage 2 starts discarding my allies.  Time to make some progress.

I send Bofur and the heroes for 12 willpower.  Out comes a White Warg, and I make 10 progress for 16/20.  I should finish the stage on Turn 7.

I engage the White Warg and put the damage on the Hunter.  I could've prevented it with Honour Guard, but since I'm defending with WG I need him to prevent a White Warg shadow (1 damage to defender) that could kill my eagle and make the attack undefended.  WG defends, Amrthiul and Hunter kill it.

Night falls (34 threat) and a Biting Wind whiffs (it damages questers).  I'm having good luck with the night reveals so far.

Turn 6: 35 threat, 16/20 1B, empty staging

I draw and play Treebeard.  Treebeard's self-readying and good stats should take pressure off Boromir.  Cold From Angmar could nerf his self-readying, but I'm nearly done with 1B and that should go away soon.

I send Bofur/Dori/Theoden for 7 willpower, with empty staging and night that's more than enough.  The deck counters with a Blood-Thirsty Warg.  I defend with one of my Winged Guardians, the shadow boosts the attack to five, but Honour Guard exhausts to prevent the Eagle-killing damage.  Boromir, Amarthiul, and the Hunter finish off Blood-Thirsty.

Turn 7: 36 threat, 16/20 1B, empty staging.

I draw a second Sterner than Steel.  As useful as shadow cancellation can be in this cycle, the dependency on Gondorian Shield makes this card useless so far.  I save my resources; I want to save Wait No Longer for a more pressing situation.

With only 4 progress needed, I send Bofur, Theoden, and Dori for 9 willpower.  I know 2B is going to bring out a wolf, so I could be facing double combat again.  The deck counters with a second copy of Cold from Angmar -- excellent timing!  I exhaust Honour Guard to prevent the damage because I'm getting worried about Dori's health, then watch both Cold from Angmars go away with the completion of stage one.  Stage two causes a White Warg to be added to staging.

I engage the White Warg, placing damage on the Hunter.  Since my HG is exhausted, I don't want to risk defending with a WG for fear of the White Warg shadow (they've been shuffled back into the encounter deck).  So I risk Treebeard instead -- wise choice, as it was a White Warg shadow and Treebeard takes one damage.  However, defending with Amarthiul would've been a *better* choice.  Let's hope Cold from Angmar doesn't reappear anytime soon.  Boromir and Amarthiul kill the wolf.

Night falls and I discard my Vassal of the Windlord.  Weight of Responsibility pulls out a Cold from Angmar and I put the damage on Dori.  That could've gone better -- now Treebeard can't self-ready or collect resources for all of stage 2.

Turn 8: 37 threat, 0/15 2B, empty staging.

I draw and play an Envoy of Pelrigir.  This is what I need, more expendable allies for stage 2's night effect.

I send my new Envoy with Bofur, Theoden and Dori for 8 willpower.  The encounter deck counters with Shrouded Hills -- with only one quest card in play, this is a 1-threat location, so I decide not to travel to it.  I want to complete 2B ASAP.

Day brings me a Support of the Eagles.  Excellent.

Turn 9: 38 threat, 0/15 2B, 1 threat in staging

I draw and play another Envoy, and my new Support of the Eagles.  Now Boromir can defend for six, though since I discarded my Vassal I can't use it for the attack instead.

With a chance to make serious progress, I decide to use my Wait No Longer, and I'm able to pluck a surging Wolf of Angmar out of the deck.  Excellent!  I send my heroes, Treebeard, both Envoys and Bofur for 13 willpower, placing 12 progress on the quest.

I ready Boromir (39 threat) and defend for six against the new wolf, then kill it with Amarthiul and Hunter.  I'm getting cocky here, with Honour Guard unexhausted I could've safely defended with a Winged Guardian, I think.

Night falls and I discard an Envoy, another copy of Shrouded Hills is revealed.

Turn 10: 40 threat, 12/15 2B, 2 threat in staging

I draw and play Gwaihir, which brings back my Vassal from the discard and into play.  This leaves me with no resources to use Winged Guardian, but I'm thinking I have enough threat left to weather the final turns, and I want Gwaihir for additional willpower.  I send Gwaihir/Bofur/Dori/Theoden for 9 willpower, and the deck counters with Rugged Country.  I take no threat increase and travel to Rugged Country; at 2 threat and 3 progress needed I don't save much by leaving it in staging.

Day gives me another copy of The Eagles Are Coming.  The revived eagle also returns to my hand.

Turn 11: 41 threat, 12/15 2B, 2 threat in staging

I draw a Gondorian Shield and play it.  This is excellent because it allows me to use my shadow cancellation if Boromir defends.  I'm anticipating clearing 2B this turn, so Boromir is the likely defender; the Winged Guardians would be destroyed by the Pack Leader.

I play my new Eagles Are Coming and it finds my final Eagles are Coming.  I play that one and it brings in another Vassal.  I play a Vassal to use for exhausting purposes.

I send my heroes, Bofur, Gwaihir, Envoy, and Treebeard for 14 wp.  A Northern Warg is revealed and I clear stage 2B.  Night immediately falls, revealing Warg's Den, and Pack Leader is added to staging.  Given the exhaustion effect, I can't afford to travel to Warg's Den, so I travel nowhere.

Since the new warg engages first, I exhaust my Vassal and a Winged Guardian for the Pack Leader's effect.  I defend against the Warg with the other WG, then defend Pack Leader with Boromir (42 threat), exhausting Support of the Eagles.  Amarthiul and Hunter kill the Northern Warg, and Pack Leader returns to staging.

Turn 12: 43 threat, 0/5 3B, 10 threat in staging.

I draw a second support of the Eagles, but can't afford to play it yet.  It's crucial that I finish this stage, so Wait No Longer is my only choice.

I play Wait No Longer and find a White Warg, I place the damage on Treebeard (he's already damaged, so one more won't hurt).  With 10 threat in staging, I need to commit exactly 15 willpower to the quest.  I send the heroes, the envoy, Bofur, Gwaihir, Treebeard, and the Hunter for exactly 15 willpower, placing 5 progress on stage 3B.

I travel to Warg's Den to get its massive threat out of staging for next turn, and pick a Northern Warg.  I have two wargs to kill.

Amarthiul blocks the white warg, Winged Guardian blocks the Northern Warg.  Boromir exhausts support of eagles for the attack, and readies twice (44/45 threat) to kill both wolves.

Night falls and reveals a North Downs.

Turn 13: 46 threat, 5/5 3B, 9 threat in staging.

I draw an Eagle of the Misty Mountains, but can't afford to play it.  Instead I put Support of the Eagles on Boromir -- super Boromir!

I send the heroes, Treebeard, Bofur Gwaihir and Enovy for 14 willpower.  A Northern Warg comes out, which allows me to clear Warg's Den and travel to North Downs.

I engage the two wolves, exhausting my Vassal and one of my Winged Guardians.

I defend the Warg with my other WG, that's successful but I can't afford to keep it, it gets discarded.

I ready Boromir (47 threat) and exhaust one of my supports for defense, no damage.

I ready Boromir (48 threat) and self-ready Treebeard, and exhaust my other support for attack.  Boromir + Treebeard + Amarthiul + Hunter can provide 17 attack and I only need 12 -- the Pack Leader is destroyed and I win!

At last!  Now I can return to testing my Dori fellowships -- the next test involves Dori in a mono-tactics deck going against Wastes of Eriador!

I finally came around to play the first quest, and chose the Múmakil.

Setup: My starting hand consists of an Honour Guard, Gandalf, Dúnedain Remedy, King under the Mountain, feint and sneak attack. As this hand includes my key card, King under the Mountain, I will keep it. I choose a Múmak Trail as the starting location.

I start my first turn with drawing West Road Traveller. I will not play anything, as the cards I would want to play costs two resources.

I commit Balin and Pippin to the quest (4wp), revealing a strangling python, surging into stampeding oliphaut. I raise my threat by one (doomed) and search the encounter deck for another múmak trail. I lose the quest, raising my threat by one. I travel to a trail, raising my threat by a third (!) point during a single quest phase.  The strangling python engages me.

Beorn defends the attack. The shadow card has no effect, and Beorn takes two damage. I’m glad that Beorn can’t have attachments, as the python otherwise would attach to him. Beorn destroys the python. Refresh.

I draw another honour guard and play an honour guard, west road traveller and king under the mountain (KutM). I exhaust KutM, adding an honour guard to my hand and discarding another copy of KutM.

I commit Balin, Pippin and West Road Traveller to the quest (6wp). The encounter deck reveals Guardians of the Jungle. The active trail is explored, and a mumak is shuffled in to the encounter deck. I choose not to travel. Refresh.

I draw close call and KutM adds a handmaiden to hand, discarding a Defender of Rammas.

I must ignore Guardians of the Jungle, I have too little willpower to explore it. Balin, Pippin and West Road Traveller quests (6wp). I reveal a stampeding oliphaunt, raise my threat and search for another trail.  No progress is made. I travel to a trail, raising my threat. Refresh.

I draw a Raiment of War. KutM gives me Arwen, discarding a Handmaiden. Honour Guard and Arwen is played.

Balin, Pippin, West Road Traveller and Arwen quests. A jungle trail is revealed. No progress is made. Refresh.

I draw Ancient Mathom. KutM add Westfold Outrider, discarding Double Back. Nothing is played. This deck needs more resource generation!

Balin, Pippin, West Road Traveller and Arwen quests (6wp). I reveal another Mumak trail. I fail the quest, raising my threat by three. This “easy” quest is killing me! Refresh.

I draw dwarven tomb. KutM adds Defender of Rammas, discards Westfold Outrider. Westfold Outrider and Galadriel’s Handmaiden is played. I need to make progress.

I sneak in a Gandalf to make progress, drawing 2 Dunedain hunters and a dwarven sellsword. Balin, Pippin, West Road Traveller, Arwen, Gandalf and Galadriel’s Handmaiden quests (14wp). I reveal a strangling phyton, surging into the savage south. The savage south whiffs, but discards both Stewards. I really needed those resources. The active trail is explored, shuffling another wild mumak into the encounter deck. Gandalf returns to my hand. I travel to the jungle trail, revealing Biting insects. It randomly discards close call, dealing no damage.

The python engages me and is defended by Beorn (shadow +2atk). Both the honour guards cancel a damage, but the shadow means that Beorn still is wounded (2 damage). Beorn kills the strangling python. Refresh in a little bit better board position.

I draw a useless copy of KutM. KutM adds a dunedain remedy to hand, discarding gather information. I play a Dwarven Sellsword, two dunedain hunters, a defender of Rammas and attach an ancient mathom to the active Jungle Trail. The hunters brings med a territorial ape and a giant centipede.

I commit Pippin, Balin, Galadriel’s Handmaiden, West road traveller, Arwen, the sellsword and one of the hunters to the quest (13 wp). I reveal a Harad Tiger. The Jungle Trail is explored and one progress is added to the current quest. A third mumak is shuffled in. The mathom draws me another sellsword, west road traveller and a test of will. I travel to a mumak trail, raising my threat by one.

The tiger engages me, and everyone receives a brand new shadow card, made in Dol Guldur (or maybe in Minas Morgul). Defender of Rammas defends against the tiger (no damage). Beorn defends the centipede, the shadow randomly discards a remedy from my hand. Beorn is aided by the honour guards and take no damage. Beorn defends the ape, which deals him four damage. Beorn and the Outrider kills the ape, a dunedain hunter kills the centipede. Refresh. I pay one to keep the sellsword.

I draw a test of will and KutM gives me a west road traveller, discarding a sellsword. I play a traveller.

I commit Balin, Pippin, Arwen, two travellers, the handmaiden, the sellsword and a hunter to the quest (15 wp). I reveal a forest clearing. With 15 willpower against 7 threat, I explore the trail, shuffling another mumak into the encounter deck. Five progress is made on the quest. I travel to the remaining mumak trail, as I want to find a mumak to tame. I raise my threat by one.

Defender of Rammas defends the tiger, and the shadow discards KutM. I guess that second copy of KutM I drew wasen’t useless. Beorn and a hunter kills the tiger. Refresh. I keep the sellsword.

I draw a copy of ancient mathom and play an outrider and a sellsword. I want to be able to play a test of will this turn.

I quest with Balin, Pippin, the two travellers, the handmaiden, Arwen (boosting the defender of Rammas) and the sellswords. (16 wp) I should make sufficient progress to complete the stage. Biting insects is revealed, discarding West Road Traveller. I deal two damage to a sellsword. They are only mercenaries. I explore the mumak trail and complete the quest stage. I choose to trigger the ability of the mumak trail, searching for a mumak. I advance to the next quest stage. The random capture objective is noose of veins (defence). I travel to the forest clearing and engage the mumak. Time to fight!

The Wild Mumak is defenden by the defender of Rammas. One honour guard and Arwen’s boost ensures that the defender survives. Beorn and a dunedaain hunter deals the mumak three damage. Refresh. My threat is quite high, 41. I need to win soon. I pay for the sellswords and return the mumak to staging.

I draw an outrider.

Balin, Pippin, the sellwords, the travellers, the handmaiden and Arwen (bossting defendr of Rammas) quests (16 wp). The encounter deck reveals another mumak. I make eight progress on the quest and explores the forest clearing, which whiffs. Both mumaks engage me.

One mumak is chumped by an outrider and the defender of Rammas defend the other one. A shadow prevents the defender to ready until the end of the round. The outrider dies a noble death, the defender is saved by one of the honour guards. Beorn and an outrider attacks the wounded mumak, dealing another three damage. Refresh. I discard the damaged sellsword and keep the other. The mumaks return to the staging area.

I draw a dunedain hunter and play Gandalf, lowering my threat by five.

I quest with Pippin, Arwen (boosting the remaining sellsword), Galadriel’s Handmaiden and two West Road Travellers (10 wp). I reveal dense jungle and make one useless progress on the current quest.

The Wild Mumaks engage me. Gandalf defends one and the sellswords the other one. Both defenders take two damage (after cancelling with the honour guards). Beorn and a dunedain hunter deals three damage to the damaged mumak, bringing it down to zero hit points. Refresh. I return the undamaged mumak to the staging area, discard the sellsword and defend the damaged mumak with Gandalf. The shadow preents Gandalf from readying, and the honour Guards keep him alive. The two remaining hit points of Gandalf is more than the zero remaining hit points of the mumak, and it’s captured! Victory!

This was a long game. Score is 38 (threat) + 8 (damage) + 100 (rounds) + zero (dead heroes) – 4 (victory points) =142. I made some mistakes, like forgetting about Balin’s ability the whole game. I need to play more dwarves. As a final thematic note, I don’t think Beorn (in bear form) would ride a Mumak. Someone should ask him.

At last, after receiving a couple of new adventure packs (race across the Harad and beneath the sands), I returned to this challenge. This is my second try at beating the first quest, the Mumakil.

My starting hand consists of Honour Guard, Honour Guard, Dwarven Sellsword, Raiment of War, Steward of Gondor and Sneak Attack. Even though this hand includes the powerful combo of Steward and Sellsword, I choose to mulligan for my key card, King under the Mountain. My new hand consists of Dunedain Hunter, Honour Guard (they keep appearing…), Defender of Rammas, Dwarven Sellsword, West Road Traveller and KutM. I like this hand, as an attacking ally, two defending allies, a questing ally and KutM, all in one go. I choose Mumak Trail as my starting location.

I start with drawing Raiment of war. Now I have my full defensive combo (Defender, Guard and Raiment). I play my dunedain Hunter, which gives me a strangling Python. I like this enemy, as Beorn can defend it and kill it without any help, and at the same time bypassing the ability of the python.

I quest with Balin, Merry and the hunter (5 wp), as I don’t want to end up nearly location-locked as the last time. The encounter deck reveals a territorial ape, and I make one progress. I travel to the mumak trail, raising my threat by one. At this time, I realize that I have Merry instead of Pippin… (I play with physical cards). Some part of me wants to keep the better hobbit, but that’s not allowed. I change Merry (s) for Pippin (s). I choose to leave the ape in the staging area, I can kill him next turn.

Beorn defends, and the shadow card gives the enemy +1 atk. Beorn takes three damage before he swings back and kills the python. Refresh.

I start with drawing a Westfold Outrider. I play KutM, which gives me ancient Mathom, discarding feint. I play defender of Rammas and West Road Traveller. The allies are mustering.

I commit Balin, Pippin and West Road Traveller to the quest (6 wp). The encounter deck reveals another Mumak Trail. I make no progress, as the ape gets +2 threat from its ability. I engage the ape.

I defend the attack with Defender of Rammas. The shadow card has no effect, and the defender survives. Beorn and the hunter kills the ape. Refresh.

I draw a honour Guard. KutM adds close call to my hand, discarding dunedain Remedy. Iplay ancient mathom on the active trail.

I commit Balin, Pippin, West road traveller and  dunedain hunter to the quest (7 wp). I reveal jungle trail, and make one progress. Now I will need willpower. Refresh.

I draw Gandalf. KutM gives me a test of will and discards Galadriel’s Handmaiden. I really wanted both those cards, but the savage south is my biggest threat. If it discards my allies… I play dwarven sellsword and Honour Guard.

I commit Balin, Pippin, West road traveller, dwarven sellsword and dunedain Hunter to the quest (9 wp). I reveal stampeding oliphaunt, which raises my threat by one and adds another mumak trail to the staging area. I make one progress. This looks more and more like my last game. This deck needs location control, but it’s so expensive. Refresh. I pay to keep the sellsword.

I draw Steward! Sadly, I will need to discard my sellsword to play it. KutM gives me close call, discarding KutM. May I please ask for willpower?

I quest with Balin, Pippin, West road Traveller, dunedain hunter and dwarven sellsword (9 wp). I reveal a forest clearing and raise my threat by two for questing unsuccessfully. Refresh. I discard the sellsword.

I draw defender of Rammas, KutM adds feint and discards Steward. I play steward on Balin. Now I can pay for more sellswords. Beorn pays for another honour Guard.

I quest with everyone (7 wp). The encounter deck reveals jungle trail. I raise my threat bu eight for questing unsuccessfully. Refresh. Please give me a miracle…

I draw… dunedain remedy. I asked for a miracle, not a zero cost healing attachment! KutM adds a defender of Rammas to my hand and discards double back. I play Gandalf, drawing three cards. The drawn cards are westfold outrider, ancient mathom and Gandalf. Not what I needed…

I commit everyone with willpower to the quest again (11 wp). The encounter deck clearly wants to see me suffer, and reveal a harad tiger. I threat out.

I made a couple of mistakes, like not playing Gandalf when I drew him, and choosing a test of will before Galadriel’s Handmaiden. It maybe was possible to win.
