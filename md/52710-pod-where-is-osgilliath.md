Forgive me for being impatient, but from what I read the Gen Con tournament cards were supposed to be going PoD one month after GC. Four weeks have gone, how much longer are we going to wait? Please FFG, pretty please, can we get them live this week? Friendly hint: I get paid at the weekend. happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]

Today is the Labor Day holiday in the U.S....maybe tomorrow?
