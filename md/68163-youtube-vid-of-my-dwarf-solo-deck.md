So I decided to take some time and record a quest using my dwarf deck (http://tinyurl.com/bu652j8 [http://tinyurl.com/bu652j8]). The quest is Road to Rivendell… feedback would be great.

Hey quite cool game. Clear mind of the player. No mistakes as i see.

Following by night is really weird card. 90% of the games is just doing nothing. I play same like you (just choose second and nothing happens).

Very solid dwarf deck.

Was funny to see Bombur with axe killing orcs around!

Show us more! RTR is very easy quest.It was no problem for you at all. Show how you deal with MIO or any quests difficulty 6 or more.I like to see it.

Good and solid game with helpful infos for new players!

One minor mistake happened during the last round: you didn't activate Lonbeard Elder's response, after which he would have lost 1 WP. However, you still would have enough WP to win the game that turn.

Strategywise I wouldn't use Dwarven Axe in this deck. As you realized yourself during the game, your heroes are busy questing and defending. Dwarrowdelf Axe is sufficient, and a Veteran Axehand costs as much as the Axe and gives you the same amount of ATT.

I also wouldn't have engaged Crebain. The shadow effects in this scenario are nasty, so you should better avoid any attack until it's not really neccessary. You could have even played "Feint" as you were already close to the end and there would have been no shadow effect at all.

Not sure, if I remember that last turn correctly, but it is a response, did he even use it?

You're right, of course. My fault, he didn't use it (I always use it).

On the note of Longbeard Elder's response… responses are always optional.

On the deck note… Dwarven Axe should go… at first I thought I would use the Erebor Record Keepers' ability to ready Thalin so I thought the Dwarven Axes might come in handy… but that hasn't worked out as planned.

Yeah… the undefended attack on the Crebain could've been nasty and it was definitely not needed. Good call on that.

You should have feinted those last 2 attacks to kill them both and avoiding all possible shadow effects, I think. As the bear has an engagement cost of 34 even an ambushing bear would not have been a problem for your last round.

Cool video, thanks for posting it!

 Really cool video! And great deck :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] I really enjoyed how you played this quest. I just have one question regarding the first encounter card in the first turn, Followed by Night. You probably did it right but I just want to be sure for when I encounter it myself. Can you really choose the last option if there's no enemies engaged with you? I mean, it does say If able, and if no one is engaged I'd say that mean they are not able to attack. I guess my question is if you can choose this option if it's not able?

Yes, you can always choose, even if one of the two options has no effect at all.

 Sweet. I'll remember that one. Thanks.

I think you may have played that wrong.
On the last quest phase you played sneak attack which allowed you to play your last ally.
Here is what I think is wrong.
Step 3:
Part 1: Commit Characters
Part 1a: Play Event Cards
So I think you may have played it wrong because you would have to have committed characters first but when you played sneak attack it would have already been past the time when you could have committed characters.
And you couldn't have played sneak attack at the end of the planning phase because the character would have gone away at the end of the phase.
Am I correct in this assessment?

Sneak attack would make no sense if it wouldn't be allowed to played before you commit characters to anything.

No,

as you can play actions before committing characters to the quest. (See the "flowchart" on the last pages of the rulebook, especially the "green" steps)

Umm.

 

It says:

3.  Quest Phase

   a.  Players commit characters to the quest.

   b  Encounter deck reveals 1 card per player

     b1  Player Actions

   c  Resolve Questing

     c1  Player Actions

 

If this is the case then no you couldn't play sneak attack before commit characters to the quest.

Unless Players commit characters to the quest also means you can play event cards from your hands too.

If you couldn't, then "We Do Not Sleep" would be utterly useless:

"Action: Until the end of the phase, Rohan characters do not exhaust to commit to quests. "

Thanks for clearing that up.

 

I just read it that you can't is all.  Sorry if I made any one mad.

Nope… no reason to make anyone mad.  That particular step (committing characters to quest) is in green.  If yo look near the top of the chart, anything in green has the following rule applied:

 

• Green – Any player can take actions generally, or
between the game steps stated in the rules.

 

I had a hard time trying to figure out when I could use my actions and abilities until I read that myself.  I lost A LOT of games early on because I had no clue that I had that ability… lol
