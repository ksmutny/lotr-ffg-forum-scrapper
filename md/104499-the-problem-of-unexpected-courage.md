I want to discuss unexpected courage and how it is bad for the game and limiting design (also my suggestions for fixing it). I personally think this is the most broken card in the game and would like to explain why.
 
Firstly though I want to say that this is not about whether you can have 3 unexpected courage but only have 1 in the core set and I would appreciate it if that derailment can be avoided as much as possible.
 
I assume everyone is familiar with unexpected courage but just in case you’re not:
 
Cost: 2 Spirit
 
Condition
 
 Attach to hero. 
 
Action: Exhaust Unexpected courage to ready attached hero.
 
Attachment
 
Readying a hero is one of the most important aspects of the game – you pay in threat for every stat point that a hero has and being able to ready is essential for utilising all that you’ve paid for.  Many heroes also have useful abilities that being able to do twice or once along with using some of their stat points is highly valuable.
 
Readying is absolutely essential for any deck that wants to run few allies as you need to maintain action economy (that is; number of actions) that matches the enemies in play or beats them as much as possible.
 
Readying is better than allies though because it allows you to make much better risk free decisions. You essentially can get the willpower for questing and then still have the defence if it’s needed, or have some other effect if the defence isn’t needed – where as if you commit allies to the quest but then find you quested too well but lack defenders, you can’t fix this mistake as easily. Additionally some of the most threatening effects can be negated (undefended attacks having to go on heroes – it’s almost always better to be able to defend with a hero).
 
Essentially readying effects are no brain choices – you always want them. I personally think they’re the best type of card to have. I think they’re important to the game though because they help to solidify the value of the core cards (heroes) and also allow for interesting plays that can’t be created with each card only being allowed one use a turn. Extra levels of complexity like readying are necessary to build a card pool and deck building game. So they have an important role to play.
 
 
So far so good; what’s wrong with Unexpected courage then?
 
“Action: Exhaust Unexpected courage to ready attached hero.”
 
 This is essentially the ultimate basic form of this rule for an attachment. (If we discount the obviously broken, ready attached hero with no drawback or cost at all). The exhaust cost is the most basic because the exhaust mechanic is the standard way to pay for any action with a card in play. Being able to ready with no other conditions at all makes it the most basic solution for readying.
 
We can see that Unexpected courage is amazing because it’s hard to see how to improve it with any finesse – we can only make a better version of it by replacing it with a superior in every way card. (For instance, attach to character, cost 1, remove the exhaust requirement – or some special rule like, if this is discarded return it to the owners hand), or a duplicate of a different sphere (tactics but otherwise identical).
 
Now the real problem is that we’ve created the superior readying card and assigned it a very low cost of only 2 resources. The secondary problem is that this card (I think uniquely of all the readying effects) can be paid for three times and have 3 readies per turn for a hero if you wish (all later readying effects cannot be chained so well or easily multiple turns in a row).
 
This means that all the other readying cards we would like to add to the game need to better than the superior version (and mostly they would require much higher costs) or we need to limit them in some way and fit them all into only cost 1 and cost 0 – which is leading to some very skewed card design.
 
 The following is a list of two other readying cards to illustrate my point.
 
Rohan Warhorse
 
 Cost: 1 Tactics
 
Mount
 
Attach to a tactics or Rohan hero. Restricted.
 
Response: after attached hero participates in an attack that destroys an enemy, exhaust Rohan Warhorse to ready attached hero
 
Attachment
 
Light of Valinor (Unique)
 
Cost: 1 Spirit
 
Condition
 
Attach to a Noldor or Silvan hero.
 
Attached hero does not exhaust to commit to a quest.
 
Attachment
 
Okay so what do we have here; firstly they’re both cost  1. (All readying in the game that targets a single hero have to be cost 1 or 0).
 
Both of them contain restricted targeting; which is interesting for balance (it lets you limit deck-building, and increase theme), but is ultimately weaker than no restrictions. 
 
Both of them are limited to only working for one single effect. (You can quest + 1 other action, or attack + 1 other action). 
 
One of them is a mount which lets it be fetched by different cards than conditions (Although it pays for that with the restricted rule – which means that unexpected courage is even better than it is for 2 attacks – because you can have two restricted attachments with it).
 
The significant detail however, is that these two cards are not even equally valuable; Light of Valinor is better. Being able to quest + any other action is more valuable than attacking (which comes after questing and defence); not having to exhaust in the first place is better for a few card effects.  The unique modifier makes it a bit less flexible if you run multiple copies but on the other hand not being restricted is a huge advantage.
 
The problem is that Rohan Warhorses is not enough worse to be cost 0, but is clearly inferior enough that it should be cheaper than Light of Valinor. This is because Light of Valinor should probably be cost 2 (especially as to prevent it being a first turn play on an included Glorfindel as the only spirit hero). 
 
However because Unexpected courage is so much better and we can’t really have a card that’s superior to it and remain balanced, all the other cards we might want to design have to fit into cost 0 or 1. I would argue that in design terms making Unexpected courage exist at all was a mistake – it should have been designed as a card not for release but as an example of what the power version of readying looks like to help with the design of new cards.
 
I hope that my two examples are sufficient to show what I’m talking about you may like to argue that Rohan warhorses is a weak card and that other examples would have shown my argument less well – however most of the other single hero ready effects either have associated resource costs to use (Miravor, Steed of the Mark) or else have to be discarded (Event cards, Cram, Westfold Horse-breaker).
 
Having established that Unexpected Courage has set the superior mark too low for readying effects I’d like to look at some solutions;
 
The best solution that involves the least changes in my mind is to ban the card. A banned card could of course still be used for casual play, but not in a formal setting. This would free up card designs that are better and more varied (2 cost readying effects, 3 cost readying effects), without invalidating any cards we currently have.
 
The big problem with this is people don’t like to have banned cards – people want to use what they paid for. A second problem is that all the cards have been designed with Unexpected Courage as a comparison would then seem a bit out of place. If we remove unexpected courage now, after a year or two all the current readying effects will probably seem a bit poor (except valinor which is too good for other reasons). It may be that even if we remove it now it’s impact will already be felt because all new cards still need to balance against the cards in existence.
 
When looking at changing individual cards, a second edition of the game would allow many of the problem cards (I think this is the worst but there are others, like valinor) to be looked at – I however doubt that many of us would be willing to invalidate all are cards and start over. I can’t see enough changes occurring to justify the second edition. 
 
This would be a reset to the whole card pool and might be nice, but I can’t see it happening and would resent it personally.
 
Finally we can look at what errata we could make to Unexpected courage, this is the route I would expect to see, though I favour banning the card myself.
 
Make it limit one per deck – this would solve the problem of a hero getting unexpected courage, 3 times, it would also mean that you can justify its low cost because of the 1 in 50 card effect. You could then have other readying effects that were cost 2 or cost 3 which didn’t have the limitation. This also prevents the chaining of the courage. – This is the most similar to the kind of errata we’ve had so far (adding limit once per round).
 
You could make it a unique card – this would be adopting the light of Valinor balancing technique. Personally I don’t think it works as well as limit one per deck for making a rare but amazing card; however it would also prevent the courage chaining and allow other cost 2 or cost 3 readying effects to be made which were not unique (but had other limitations). This effect has gone some way towards making Steward of Gondor not the most broken card.  
 
These two solutions are similar in feel and it depends if you need to balance more for multiplayer or single player I feel (limit one per deck = one copy per player, whereas unique is one copy in play per game). I think the first is better because I think that unexpected courage has less impact on bigger games. Either of these two errata would have minimal impact compared with my other suggestions.
 
You could errata the cost. I think unexpected courage is so good it could be cost 5; on the other hand I think at cost 5 people  wouldn’t play it – I think at cost 3 it’s still too cheap so I would argue for the errata to cost being at 4. Cost 4 would allow you to have all the room for cost 2 and 3 readying effects as suggested before; would not invalidate anyone that did own many copies of the card. I think 4 is best because it guarantees needing to play it on turn two (without resource acceleration), even in a mono-sphere deck, while still allowing you to play it turn two if you had spirit as the major sphere in a dual deck.  We’ve never had an errata to a card cost, however 4 is clearly closer to the cost it should be than 2.  I’d be happy with this change.
 
You could errata the targeting. For example – make it so that only willpower 1 heroes can receive it (that’s why it’s unexpected). This would instantly free up the design of the readying effects – remove the superior form of the card from the game. You could maintain some of the uniqueness of the card (it still has the freedom of any two actions; it still has the ability to stack with itself much better than any of the more restricted versions).  I like this idea, but I think it’s not enough.  On the other hand low willpower heroes are generally less good to have multiple actions on (Beregond getting multiple defences would still be amazing but that’s still reducing the viability of the card a lot).
 
You could add a new type of condition we haven’t seen before (we’re getting into the realms of fantasy here so this is my last suggestion) for instance, if attached hero takes damage discard this card – this type of change would do all the stuff I’ve said before and also help the card to be powerful but more easily lost. I believe this also matches the theme the card was going for – it’s always made me think of Merry vs the Witch-king.

My last two suggestions are such fundamental departures from the current card design that they would in effect be new cards. I feel that the new cards would be better than keeping Unexpected Courage as is, in the card pool, but then we may as well just ban the card.
 
In conclusion; Unexpected courage in its current form is an overpowered card. Not just because it’s very very good, but because it is starting to show cracks in the card designs. While other power cards exist (Light of Valinor and Steward of Gondor both listed in this post, but there are others). Each of them have limitations which ‘at least’ mean you can imagine better cards than them while still following the balance and card design rules in place. Unexpected courage is basically so good you don’t need new cards – and can’t make new cards that work better than it.
 
It would be healthier for the game to address this problem now, rather than later after another full cycle of card designs. AS a result I would like them to change the card (or officially ban it) so that a fuller range of card designs options which are the life of the game can be explored.

Good thoughts. I agree it is over-powered, perhaps on par with Steward of Gondor, but maybe not more powerful. 

 

I think errata would be ok if they either made it unique or limit one per deck. Simple fix. I only have one core set and do not proxy, so I just use one per deck and it feels balanced for me. (it certainly is unexpected when it comes up, and not vital to winning every game, but very happy to see it up).

yes uc is a broken a bit. I think unique is a solution....

If I had to choose a solution I would go limit 1 per deck. It never really becomes game breaking at that point

I think steward of gondor is more powerful, no?

I only have two core sets so only include 2 copies of UC. The reason I don't think it's that broken is that:

A) LOV is better in some cases (ie spirit glorfindel)

B ) some heroes are only good at one thing (ie eowyn)

C) you don't need multiple options ever turn

In fact using cram is better at times (recycling is possible with the lore dwarf card as well).

You often only need th excess options a few times a game and cram can be enough for most quests.

UC also costs two - same as arwen. If I have two resources floating around I tend to put arwen out first as she gives two quest points and a big defense boost.

I think perhaps making UC unique would be resonable(like arwen and SOG and LOV), or even one per player. But since most people i play with only have one or two core sets we rarely see more then one copy anyways.

I had an article about Unexpected Courage a few months ago, I believe. I think reactions were divided. I fully support the above (or what I wrote before), Unexpected Courage is a problem. I see no problem between Light of Valinor and Rohan Warhorse, they are different sphere, and the Mount keyword will get more support than Condition, probably.

 

Also, after I began trying to avoid Courage, just because I thought it was a bad design (too powerful), I re-discovered Miruvor, which is great in certain decks, especially in one Spirit hero decks as you can play it on round 1. Also it is an item. But this is totally off the point.

 

My solution would be as mentioned above: Unexpected Courage, limit one per deck. I think that is much better than making it unique. Also unique makes little sense for such a title.

In fact, for me, Unexpected Courage is not broken. It begins to become over powered when you start piling attachments to one hero and start creating what I call the “Super Heros” (for instance, Legolas with a Rivendell Blade, and a Rivendell Bow and a Dagger of Westernessee and 3 marks of Dunedain and 3 unexpected courage).

A good way to diminish this “super Heros” aspect (especially of the solo game) is to consider all attachment to be restricted. Thus, Unexpected Courage will not be overpowered.

I think it is not over-powered. Novice players always want to play it, like stewards of gondor, and feint, etc. But after, when you have more experience, you prefer other options, first of all, for fun. But there are other reasons, for exemple, i prefer miruvor or cram, when you know good games only need 3 rounds to win, more or less, and unexpected becomes expensive for it. Miruvor or cram are enough for it.

 

PD: i remember lots of moments that one player put in table a copy of UC and say 'who wants?' and nobody answer :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] . Finally one says: myself... but only for not lossing the card, lol.

The fact is the card is not needed to win by any means. And actually within the Spirit sphere, not many heroes absolutely crave for it, far from it. But I think the OP has the same point I do: it is a problem when compared to other cards, and that is not only a problem for players but for designers also, it restricts their development. I agree it would be best to "correct" this before it is too late. 1 per deck cannot hurt anything. The errata is there already, so why not here?

I hate these forums for formatting sometimes. The post below managed to turn out right :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] 
 
I'll use this post to respond to some other suggestions, even though I wrote it after the post below.
 
Courchevel if you make every attachment restricted you don't actually solve the problem of UC being better than competitors, I actually think you make it worse. If every hero can only have two attachments then you want more than ever to make sure it's the best two, apart from when you desperately need to stack attack or defence to deal with big hits you're much better off with a ready effect.

Mndela - the number of better options for readying are very specific (and limited in many ways) You suggest that Miruvor or Cram would be better. They do have the advantage of an initial cost being cheaper (you can play down more right at the start). In a really short quest them being one use may not be a problem and they might edge out UC but it's quest specific.

Miruvor costs you one resource a turn to maintain 'and' prevents you drawing anything else without other card draw. That means that it maintains your boardstate while the quest progresses. Sometimes that's okay sometimes it isn't.  You can fetch these attachments back with other cards, but that's devoting more cards and effort than UC requires.

I'm afraid I don't believe you when you say no one wants UC (except that you want to avoid it for fun). UC is almost always better than any of the cost 1 options because of increased flexibility, and better than the cost 0 options because it will be maintained round after round, as long as readying is what you want the card for.

In fact the only real times that UC is worse are:
You only have 1 spirit resource turn 1, and you need the ready effect turn 1. (In which case Miruvor edges it out).
You're playing Spirit Glorfindel and you have Valinor available, and you wany Glorfindel to be questing.
You're expecting a random attachment destruction effect and so don't want to potentially waste 2 resources. (Although in this case any attachment would be better in hand unless you have no non attachment options).
You expect the game to last 3 rounds at most AND can't play UC turn 1 but could play a 1 cost alternative turn 1, but you still need the ready effect turn 1 - otherwise you're better waiting for turn 2 to get UC.

Obviously Miruvor has other options for flexibility that make it desirable: it can be a cost 0, +1 willpower effect instead, it can be a quest at +1 willpower and ready effect, It can even be a cost 0 put this on top of your deck irreverent card that stalls gamestate for the player and no one else (I've never seen it used for this purpose - but maybe if you knew the top card of your deck was going to be turned into poison it might be nice).

UC is just better for readying though.

Thanks to everyone that took the time to read. It looks like it belongs on a blog rather than a post.

You need to be careful when you start comparing cards with wildly different effects. Steward of Gondor is more powerful early (you can play steward and then unexpected courage turn 1, you can't play unexpected courage then steward turn 1). On the other hand resource acceleration effects are not in fact very valuable by themselves - Unexpected courage could save a hero, or over two turns double your quest output.
 
Resource acceleration requires other cards to work with it. This is more notable later in the game, you can't draw UC and say, hey this is useless, but if you're out of cards and draw steward of Gondor you may wish you had something that could actually do something - since just getting more resources by itself is not a winning strategy.
 
 
Light of Valinor is 'only' better because of Spirit Glorifindel and then - you have another problem with the argument. Spirit Glorfidndel himself is stupidly overpowered (He should have had forced: raise your threat by one at the end of the round - instead of the mechanic they gave him). It's not really a strong argument for LOV that it's better than unexpected courage in exactly one instance (also the two together is still better - much better in fact).
 
Not needing multiple options every turn is sort of against the idea of planning against the encounter deck - the game is primarily risk management, and more options is always better risk management. Making Elrond able to quest and defend is a better play than having an ally that can only quest most of the time.
 
Arwen is a good card - she has 2 willpower for 2 with a bonus effect which is pretty nice. If you need the +1 defence and the willpower she may be better turn 1 than UC - in most cases they'll be even (it depends what you draw from the encounter deck to determine the better choice). Even then you have the same problem here, you're comparing different effects and choosing some of the best cards in the game - which mainly goes to show how highly valued UC is.
 
Many games like this (CCG, LCG, early war games) have big balance issues that become apparent and need correcting. Some of the power cards that are created for this game are clearly going to limit the design if allowed to continue unchecked - it's more for the design and longevity of the game than the issue of the individual cards that I want errata (or a ban).
 
Both Steward and UC are too good in their current form but UC is the bigger problem because it's a step above the copetition in terms of lack of restrictions and enabling freedom of play.
 
Lleimmoen; I didn't know you'd posted about this before - though it comes as no surprise to find that others feel the same way :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Rapier, I am only happy you did now. And you give some great points. I was basically comparing UC in the light of the (then) new Steed of the Mark. The horse paled badly in comparison, especially as it came in the same sphere. Warhorse is Tactics where there are no readying attachments, so that is less of a problem, I feel.

 

I like your example of the Steward in the latter game, you need cards to work with it, though the accumulated wealth can be now more useful than before thanks to Gondorian Fire, Blood of Númenor and Lay of Nimrodel (we had had Map-maker before but these new ones work much better in that regard).

Those cards make resource acceleration a lot more useful - potentially making Steward too good in itself (It allows you to get resource acceleration at no cost turn 1 and then benefit forever after) - more of a problem even is that steward of Gondor allows Blood of Numenor and Gondorian Fire to be used every round and still get better every round.

Even then however without readying effects you can only get your big attack or defense once per turn - which is an alternative way of say, just stacking gondorian shields. Lay of Nimrodel is probably the best but that's an event so to keep using that you need to cycle events out of the discard as well.

If I was in charge of doing the errata - I would be looking at UC and Steward, but I think UC is superior in more situations and also far more superior in terms of relative card design.

Wow there is a lot thoughts about this card.

 

I don't have any problems with unexpected courage the way that it is. I don't mind that some cards are more 'powerful' or cheaper or easier to use than other cards - especially cards that are included in the core set... such as unexpected courage or Steward of Gondor etc...

 

This card is no longer an auto include for me, or others by the sounds of things. There are many different fun ways to build decks without it or Steward of Gondor or [enter name of 'overpowered' card here]. I would hope UC remains unchanged.

Can I ask why it isn't an auto include? Mndela implies that is isn't because it just isn't fun.

I also recognize that it isn't an autoinclude if you don't want ready effects on heroes (ally dwarf build for instance).

 

Being able to build without it does not mean it isn't overpowered.

And more importantly, doesn't mean it isn't making the design alot harder and narrower for the game designers.

UC is an ok card. It's definitely not overpowered, as it can be removed by shadow effects (which happens more often lately). Allies are more important, and I'd always prefer to play Arwen or Westroad Traveller to UC. Especially early in the game you want to have some allies out in the game.

 

Most heroes don't need UC, as their stats are weak (Hobbits) or onesided in their abilities (Eowyn). However, there are some heroes that beg for this card - Gimli, Faramir, Aragorn etc. Heroes that are good in all departments, and who are not that awesome because you can only use one of their abilities. The other abilities are still neat, but you cannot use them. Instead ypu have a deck with a high starting threat and you think "well, if I'd wanted a 2 WP hero, I could have taken a Hobbit". With UC though, you have a hero that has 2 WP and 3 ATT. Sounds a lot better. Ok, not so much if you only have one copy like me (LIKE IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE :ph34r: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_ph34r.png] ).

I get the impression a lot of people are misconstruing Rapier's insights and missing the point. He's not just talking about UC, but the bad precedent UC has set in later card design, which I agree with.

 

I like the two ideas of increasing its cost to 3 and making it unique with a twist; Unique per player.

You say in one sentence what I took 3 pages to write :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

This is exactly what I'm concerned about. If UC was just a good card, I would accept that some cards have to be better. UC is more than just a good card; it's a design breaking card. (The design being the hero readying attachment).

For lots of reasons: 

1) Many different event, attachment and even ally cards that ready heroes - Miruvor, fast Hitch, Cram, Naith Scout, Rider of the mark, Rohan/Dwarven/Leadership events (new 'Aragorn' attachment) etc.. 

2) Heroes with reading actions; Prince Imrahil, Sam, Tactics Boromir, Aragon, Elledan, Elrohir, Merry, Brand...

3) Ally focus rather than heroes doing everything.

4) One dimensional heroes like Eowyn who doesn't warrant readying (in most cases)

5) Soloing with the ability to strike into the staging area, negating most defending and reducing readiness requirements. ie Dunhere + weapons or Rangers/Traps/scrying

6) Mono Tactics, Leadership, Lore deck... or Mono Spirit with using Tracker styled Caldara deck; ie Eowyn doesn't warrant it, Glori has LoV & Caldara keeps running away to get help dying)

7) Boring to use the same toys all the time.

8) Cost... there are times when 2 spirit resources are better spent else where

 

I agree that being able to exclude this card doesn't therefore make it not 'overpowered'. I simply don't think of it as overpowered. The variety of different options available is one of the main reason don't think of it like this.

Yes. I think that is the misunderstanding here. The main point of the thread, as I see it, is in future (or even current) design development. Action advantage is one of the main aspects of the game, and Unexpected Courage messes up other similar cards, like Steed of the Mark.

> Increasing Unexpected Courage cost to 3 would kill it.

I actually tend to agree in a way, I would think hard before playing it for 3 resources, the difference between two and three is substantial. I do not think it would be a bad card by any means, but I prefer the "uniqueness" of sorts, either 1 per deck or similar. It is strange that cards like Unexpected Courage have no requirement whilst inferior cards (in power) do. I think it comes from the early mistakes in the design. And it is exactly these mistakes that need to be corrected. I mean Beravor did, Protector of Lórien did, even Expert Treasure-hunter. I believe UC is much more obvious target because it has so many "peers".

I too prefer other options, just as you provided. I play Miruvor, Horse-breaker, even the Steed, and I am looking forward to new options like Naith Guide or The White Council. But all that does not take away the argument in the first place...

I think I totally understood the intention of the OP and I disagree. I agree that it could have been made unique, but then I think that it is somewhat ridiculous to buy three core sets to get three copies of UC and then call "let's make it unique".

 

This had been said a zillion times now, but this game is cooperative, so if you think a card is overpowered, just don't use it. UC isn't broken, so it doesn't need an errata. If you play with only one copy, this card is a nice extra that sometimes pops up out of your deck. But even then I found myself not playing it because I needed these two resources for other, more important stuff.

 

And if you think this game is too hard (and I believe there is a solid mass of players that struggle with the game), you can use all three copies to make sthings a bit easier for you.

I don't think you have (sorry to be directly confrontational about it). I intentionally said I didn't want to discuss the only 1 copy in core aspect because it's an entirely different complaint, that a lot of people feel strongly about. If they made the unique or limit one per deck erratas I was suggesting some people who bought multiple cores might be annoyed (if they did it just for UC). That might mean we never get the errata that I'm arguing would improve the game design for other reasons, but from a game design perspective they should change it and sooner rather than later.

Equally saying that it's a co-op game I can just ignore the card also misses the major point I'm making - which is that the problem is this card is hurting the design of the game. It's hurting the balance and design of new cards that we're getting in the future. The designers don't have the ability to ignore the card when they make new cards and new encounters.

I'm absolutely certain that they would never make a card like UC now if it hadn't already been made - just look at how much better it is than every ready effect in the game besides it.

UC is the only card that has all of the following features:

 

Usable every turn

Requires nothing to maintain it after the initial cost

Will grant any two actions you want

Has only a hero restriction for targeting

It's just supremely better than the alternatives, not just "a bit better" not even better but on the same scale - we're talking about a card that is designed an order of magnitude better.

The problem with this idea is that for the most part UC will always fit into any deck because it's so much less restricted than other cards - Other readying effects exist that are more specific in their targeting (only Noldor, only rohan, only tactics heroes) or have restrictions that mean you need to build around them to use them more (discard after use, pay resources).

I'm sure plenty of people will want to play with the specific ready effect that matches what they want (mounts in a rohan deck for instance), and will choose to leave out unexpected courage because it's thematically less appealing. 

And when I say that UC is overpowered I don't mean to the extent that others seem to think (to the extent that you have to play it to win). I'm talking about the fact that actually it's just better than alternatives that people might prefer to play. You can make do (and plan around) the other ready effects instead and still win.

You can't objectively argue that UC isn't the 'best' though - you can argue that it isn't 100% the best (others may be better in some circumstances, cram, fast hitch, light of valinor all have stronger situations), but in terms of cost to power, flexibility for readying, UC also lacking any restrictions will fit into any deck that runs spirit and can combo with any other hero readying effects in the game - every turn.

## 31 [leptokurt on April 23, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/104499-the-problem-of-unexpected-courage/?do=findComment&comment=1059345)

Well, we can play the ball back and forth forever. Seems like some players don't have a problem with the design of UC, while some want to have an errata and some think the design could have done better, but that it doesn't need an errata.

 

IMO errata should only be done if the card is broken (like Beravor) and a vast majority of players want to have that errata. I don't see any of these two points fullfilled ATM.

 

Btw, just because I don't agree with the OPs reasoning doesn't mean that I don't understand the point he's trying to make. If the main point is to make UC unique, than there is no need for an errata, as each player can do that by himself.

 

And just because the OP says that the numer of core sets doesn't play a role in this discussion doesn't make it any more true. Because that's what the problem is mainly about. If you have only one copy, guess what: you have no problem! Steed of the Mark is totally playable for me and in no way influenced by UC. That's mainly because I can rely on getting that card in my hand. So if you have three copies and UC is a problem for you, take two copies and put them somewhere out of reach. Problem solved.

 

Don't get me wrong, I totally agree that UC should have been designed as a unique card from the start. However, that's not enough to errata the card now. We already have enough errataed cards and should only call for them if that's really neccessary. Especially as this special problem can be easily solved without an errata.

The main point is not something that effects players now. Nor is it something that players can impact at all by just asserting self control. 

The main point is that UC is bad from the point of view of designing new cards - trying to fit all single target ready effects into only cost 0 and 1 or coming up with something even better than UC to be cost 3 (how about exhaust Super Unexpected Courage to ready 3 heroes in play).

UC is an archatypeal card in this game - it sets the predecent and power of similar effects. The problem is that it does it not just as the top end (I would argue Steward of Gondor is the top end of power for it's card type), but above what actually works for the game.

Fast Hitch is the closest too it - it shares almost every property except that it has to target hobbits. However - so far no hobbit has an exhaust to do something ability and all hobbits have the feature of having poor stats (so that extra actions from them are less valuable). So the card is significantly less good while still good. 

 

I'm not sure exactly what your position is though? I get the feeling you think UC is too good really - and that it should have been designed out of the gate to be different and weaker but that you don't want an errata even if it would be better for the game because you don't think UC is so bad as a play experience that it breaks the game? The way that Berevor card draw did. I mean her card draw being so good is mainly exacerbated by UC - if she could only ready after using Rohan Warhorses it probably wouldn't have needed an errata.

My position is the opposite, I think that UC was a design mistake (for which I don't fault the designers as complicated new games are bound to have mistakes like this), the fault with UC is not in itself but in the direction it forces the game to expand. Which is fine if the game has a limited life, but I want to be getting new content 5 years from now personally.

 

For the record I am the OP and I only have one core set - my problem with UC is not how it breaks my games (it doesn't - I either don't play it or play only one) the problem is how it breaks the design of new cards.

These are, again, excellent points.

I would just add this, some of the other attachments might see a sort of advantage in terms of traits, like the Mount attachments. To give an example, in my Rohan deck I run three copies of Westfold Horse-breeder and three copies of Rohan Warhorse (together with a copy of Steed of the Mark). I usually keep the opening hand when I have the ally and more often than not he also brings the horse if did I not have him already (one could do the math to see the probabilities). So it is already definitelly easier to get Rohan Warhorse in play on Round 1 than to get Unexpected Courage, but this doesn't make the above points less valid.

Well, this is really not a valid argument in my opinion, that every player can do it for himself. It is like if someone argues the speed limit should not be 70 miles but only 50 and you say it is no problem because everyone can only drive 50 anyways. To be less abstract, we are not arguing what one can do on his own table, we are arguing if the design is wrong or not. And finally, as the OP says, the problem is that the designers cannot ignore existing cards when making new ones.

 

Now, for Beravor, I would not doubt it for one second that Unexpected Courage was a better card than Beravor before the errata. And I actually remember the polls and I would not be in a minority on that one. Actually, it was only Unexpected Courage that was making Beravor so good, there was no other way to give her action advantage so easily - and little altogether. So it would have been so much more easier to errata UC instead of Beravor in the first place (though I see both deserve it). Even now, with all the card pool, what cards would you be using to use Beravor's ability again and again in one round? Cram? Miruvor? Brand? Not so easy...

To compare a cooperative game with traffic is not really helping your point. I say this after almost being pushed from the street by some rowdy today.

 

And we are not argueing if the design is wrong or not, we argue if the card should get an errata. That's two different points and my opinion is that UC doesn't need an errata.

 

Wrong design: I tend to agree. Errata: no, sir!

the problem of uc

is combo card. with some other cards it can be broken. like it was before with Beravur. so to avoid it just make it unique. it will be still very powerful card but there will be no problem with some crazy powerful combos

For me it is not broken. UC + Beravor only give to players +2wp (or +2 def or attack). So it becomes like Celebrian Stone (or Gondorian Shield, or Dagger, even they are cheaper than UC).

 

PD: yesterday, playing a nightmare hard quest, the first card i discarded by Eowyn was UC. ^_^ [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_happy.png]

It's not about UC being broken, but about how the design affects the making of future cards with readying effects, as one would always prefer UC to any of the possible new cards.

I think it is just stubborness to call Beravor broken and not Unexpected Courage, especially without providing single argument. I did not expect something like that from someone as intelligent. You can laugh about my traffic example but it is at least an argument, just stating things as facts is not discussion. How was Beravor broken if not for Unexpected Courage (being able to land on her from every player in multiple copies)?

Yesterday i played Beravor and 2 spirit heroes more. I played on Beravor 2 Miruvors. In 3 rounds we won the game. Each round i used Miruvor on Beravor for ready her and get 1 resource. The 3rd round we didnt need ready her, the game was very good and we were going to win anyway. Thanks to Miruvor i could play good lore cards; if only i played Unexpected Courage, i couldn't play almost nothing with lore sphere in only 3 rounds.

So, in this example, Miruvor is better than Unexpected Courage.

The Beravor/UC combo was broken. Both card are fine on their own, I hope we agree about that.

 

The main difference between Beravor and UC is that you can use Beravor's ability right from the statt, while you cannot rely on using UC. I think we also agree that UC is no way broken if you use only one copy of it. I think we disgaree about the rest. And for that we don't need an errata, but only a place to store the copies of UC that you won't use anymore. Nobody forbids you to that. You don't need the designers to tell you to do that.

 

The need of errata is something that has been discussed hee long ago, and a arge majority of players opted for keeping the errata to an absolute minimum, to do an errata only if a card was breaking the game mechanics. UC is probably not the best card design, but it doesn't break the game. All it does is to give one of your heroes one additional action. Compare UC to Erebor Hammersmith - this guy costs 2 resources and gives you an additional action, fuels the power of many dwarf characters, adds 3 HP in case you have to deal some damage, brings an attachment back to your hand and he receives a bonus from Dain. And there are even two copies of him in the core set!

This isn't really a good example because you're talking about the resource fixing element that's needed for the smaller sphere as the main advantage. You're getting resource advantage in lore at the cost of resource loss in spirit. Yes it's something that Miruvor can do that UC can't but it's because Miruvor is a very flexible card that's it's better in some circumstances.

To fully stat out your example;

You have 2 spirit and 1 lore resource you trade 1 spirit for 1 lore so that you can play a 2 cost lore card turn 1 and get to use Beravor to quest and draw.

You do the same thing again on turn two (swapping a spirit resource for a lore and getting to ready). This combination for mana fixing as you describe is only better if you're talking about a game that's going to take you 2 rounds to win, or if you desperately need the 2 cost lore card on turn 1.

If you did it the other way around you could have done UC on Beravor turn 1; this would have got you 3 ready effects instead of two in your three round game - you could then have played one miruvor on Beravor turn 2 and gotten +1 resource, put it back on your deck - and then draw Miruvor + one other card for ever for the rest of the game using the UC at the cost of swapping one resource from spirit to lore. This is a much better combo to set up than you can ever do with just miruvor and allows you any turn you want to swap spirit resource for 1 lore resource + 1 card, in a game that's 4 rounds or more this would 'always' be better than just Miruvors. The Unexpected Courageous obviously pay off more the longer the game goes.

Miruvor's also a very good card, I'm not going to dispute that and because it can also be +willpower + resources it is situationally better than UC; but not as a ready effect unless your game lasts 2 rounds or less. (In a 2 round game, Miruvor is pretty much just better because it potentially can be 2 ready effects for cost 0 - although even then you need to draw two of them).

Do you mind if I ask how you're getting quests that are so short? It's pretty rare for me to play a game that's only 3 rounds or less. In such a short game the discard cards (Cram, Miruvor - various eagle and noldor cards) would gain a lot of relative power, but I almost never get to play such short games.

Edit: 3 rounds or less is the minimum possible for most quests.

Well, now I am a bit confused, are you saying that Beravor is broken even with the errata? Because you say you can use her right away? I thought you meant she "was" broken before the errata because you could use her more than once per round. But the only way to achieve that repeatedly is pretty much by having UC on her. What else is there? I repeat, Miruvor, Cram? Yet, the card got fixed and you said there you understood the errata. But you do not understand it with UC. That makes no sense because the problem was UC in the first place, or really, enlighten me, how were you readying Beravor?

 

We certainly agree Beravor/UC is a wrong combo but we do not agree which of the two causes the problem.

 

Erebor Hammersmith is an ecellent ally. We agree about that for sure. The only problem I see in the list, however, is Dain, another totally lazy design in my opinion, but a topic for another thread.

As a player that pulls resources from a limited card pool, I appreciate the fact that I can play 3 copies of UC.  The power creep exhibited by encounter decks is obvious, and expected.  This is less of an issue for the players who are also collectors, with access to the latest and greatest wizz-bang cards.  However, for those who rarely buy adventure packs, and even less frequently buy expansions (like myself), the presence of OP cards are essential to fielding a deck that has any reasonable chance against any of the current encounters.

 

I understand that most of the folks reading this thread care enough about the game that they probably buy everything released, and I think that is great.  It is the financial support of those players that allows FFG to keep producing this great game, and I am happy making my strategic purchase here and there.

 

It is my opinion that any action towards the TC's argument would cripple the ability of players in my position to compete with current encounters.  I was disappointed when Beravor got her nerf precisly for this reason.  However, I also realize that I am probably in the minority.

I hear you man, I also have a limited card pool, (no Dain, Spirfindel, or Elrond) so being able to include three copies of power cards like, SoG, celebrians stone, or UC can help me beat quests I otherwise would not be able to.

This is an interesting perspective, thanks for that. I would understand that just as there is the easy-mode, also the cards before errata could be used by players in the same way: to achieve an easier mode of sorts. It would be perfectly logical with the limited card pool.

Not that I feel this is very productive any more, but you never ONCE explained what makes Beravor ante errata broken if Courage is not. Because Courage was the only reliable way to use Beravor repeatedly in one round (Common Cause and the likes are really not that great, I think we both know that).

Uhm, I think I explained that? (but apparently not very well <_< [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_dry.png] )

 

1. Beravor was broken because one could exploit her ability with the help of Unexpected Courage. I think at that time we didn't have any other cards to play that fiddle.

 

2. Unexpected Courage is not broken because it exploits Beravor ability. Otherwise cards like Miruvor would also be broken.

 

3. In conclusion, both Beravor and UC have been fine all alone, as it didn't matter if you could use Beravor's ability multiple times if there was no way to ready her.

 

4. However, the combo of these two cards was definitely broken, One card had to be errataed. And that had to be Beravor herself, as every other readying attachment had to be designed in a way that it couldn't ready heroes starting with a B.

 

 

In conclusion, it was Beravor's ability that was broken. Yes , UC and others cards were involved in the exploit, but they were not the cause of it. Restricting Beravor's ability was by far the easiest way to correct that design error.

Thanks for taking the time to respond. I can see the issue with this - but at the same time I feel that the game (beyond the obviously entry designed products like the saga quests and core set) really needs to assume that players have access to all the cards.

At the same time maybe this further reinforces my argument for banning the card or rather - make it an "easy mode" card. If you're playing easy mode then play UC but if you're not then you should be playing at the "tournament" standard. 

The idea of an easy mode and tournmant standard is quite good for keeping all the cards playable but also opening up the ability for the game to be more accessible to all players and allowing tighter design (and design experimentation).

I have to disagree that UC is breaking the design of the game.  Maybe it is limiting an influx of exhaust to use effects, but if you look at MtG design as an example, many of the best or most creative cards have nothing to do with tapping of cards.  I would argue that by forcing the designers to be more clever than just designing a glut of heroes with "exhaust to ___" effects, UC has only helped the direction of recent designs.  The Silvan cards are a good example.  I am more excited about these cards than I was about Outlands, Doomed, or even Gondor because the mechanic of bouncing into and out of play leaves more freedom in design than just stacking benefits (Outlands) or adding/moving resources (Gondor, for the most part), and Celeborn's effect is more interesting than "exhaust to add 2/2/2 to a Silvan ally" or something along those lines.  There are many cards that will need to be flat out retired at some point.  Vilya for example will only get more and more powerful as high cost cards are added to the pool.  Perhaps UC is one of those cards but it is certainly not the only one.  Here is one solution to the problem:  a 2nd edition core set.  Include new cards to replace ones that are too powerful and add a few new heroes.  They could also have 2 scenarios and fix the ridiculous situation of not having 3 of each player card in the base set, which always seemed foolish to me (at least have two of each player card).

I will say that they were wise to choose spirit as the sphere for UC during the initial game design as if it was in lore with all that card draw and no need to include spirit or songs, it would then be absolutely broken.

I don't understand the relevance of a comparison to Magic the Gathering. Apart from the fact that tap and exhaust are mechanically the same. Relatively speaking they're totally different in weighting between the two games.

A creature card in MtG has some passive traits/abilities, maybe a special rule and an attack and defence. Most cards in that game can only ever attack or defend. You also only get one attack step so you cannot re-attack with the same character. (Although you can use untap effects to multiple block).

As a result an untap effect in MtG is worthless on the attack step for most cards. Most cards cannot do anything except attack or defend so untapping would be mostly pointless for them.

A character in Lotr has some passive traits/abilities can quest, attack and defend and maybe have a special rule that needs to be exhausted for. Even if you ignore the fact that every card in this game can multiple attack and defend if you can ready it you can still see that the cards in this game are needed to cover more ground so ready effects are obviously more powerful.

Additionally the penalty for failing to quest or failing to defend is much harsher than in MtG. In MtG you can continue to fight at full strength until you have 0 life. In Lotr failing to quest increases threat (which is like losing life as a countdown to losing) except that threat also goes up every turn - so unlike MtG you cannot stall for a better future game-state if you get to the position where you can prevent life loss. 

Additionally in Lotr failing to defend means having your best (and mainly irreplaceable cards) potentially destroyed - which not only cripple your chances of fighting back immediately, they also permanently reduce your resource generation - meaning you cannot fight back as well later. This is because as the player takes incremental damage in this game they become less able to fight back.

Your other point is completely unfair to the designers of this game. If they could design ready effects of more varied types they could create more variety, not less. You're looking at an entirely different layer of the design than what we're talking about and then arguing that if the designers could get away with using only one layer they would - which is clearly and completely untrue.

The design of the different races and factions (to have a different play style and feel) is a different level of design from the design of the more basic features such as ready effects. I'm glad that you think their Sylvan mechanic is going to interest you more than the Gondor/Outlands ones did becuase htat's cool. (I also think it's cool what they're doing with the sylvan).

However it's got nothing to do with ready effects which exist as a more basic mechanic. We won't be seeing a race that is just different because it has access to ready effects or more +1s or something of that ilk because the differences in the races are a bit more subtle than that.

I'd be quite happy to discuss those subtleties in another thread and I agree that some of the races are simpler than others (The Gondor and Dwarf themes are a bit uninteiresting, the eagle theme needs some serous development despite a decent number of cards) but those simpler mechanics for some races are necessary, firstly because they still add value in variety of play, but also because some players really like playing them. Another point about the races is that (apart from the Eagles) the races all really have more than one theme to them.

But really that doesn't change the fact that UC is ruining the ability to design ready effects - more restricted and situation ready effects would be a lot more interesting, instead we got UC which is exactly what you're complaining about, boring and supreme.

Although I am curious about your belief that many cards would have to be retired - it seems to me that for the most part future cards will take awareness of the current card pool - so only cards that limit design would be a problem in the future. (However any card that does limit design should be addressed as quickly as possible to prevent them bleeding into the card pool).

Now in the case of UC I think we could just weaken UC and not have to worry about the other cards because UC as it exists is also the least interesting ready effect imaginable. We don't want them to have more cards like UC we want them to make more cards that are worse than UC but have the flexibility to spread the weaker ready effects across more costs.

Your comment about Vilya is a bit more difficult to evaluate.

In theory a deck which ran Vilya and 49 6 cost allies could be built (when 49 different 6 cost allies exist) and providing you drew Vilya as one of the 13 cards you get to see first you could play one six cost ally a turn. Which sounds pretty good - maybe you're right and Vilya will need to be errated. 

On the other hand when we reach a point like that we might have found that all the adventures are also more difficult - by that point the ability to run a full 50 card themed deck that is also strong will be the case. So while I think Vilya is a card that potentially will always need to be watched - I think from a design point of view it won't be terribly worse or better than it is now (unless mistakes are made).

Vilya already does have some built in limitations though - you have to use Elrond, and you have to exhaust Elrond to use Vilya (getting rid of UC would instantly nerf Elrond/Vilya for this reason). Even with only Light of Valinor, Elrond and Vilya become less flexible (you lose out on  3 defence).

In any case I would like to see Light of Valinor at the 2 cost it clearly should be, but that can only happen if UC is changed first (as it is clearly superior).

I also agree with many that the best fix would be to make it a limit 1 per deck. This not only makes the card more balanced but it makes sense thematically as it is unexpected so it should come up unexpectedly. Unexpected Courage is not only boring, but is unlimited making it way too powerful for its cost and definitely then harms any future cards that would be made with readying effects. I think readying effects should be cheap, at 2 or less cost but be limited to traits or readying with specific Responses as many readying cards are made now. Simply being able to ready at any time can easily be abused especially if people have 3 of these badies in their decks. Would this errata (limit 1 per deck) be enough to help the future health of readying effects for this game? Also why would they errata a card especially one from the core set after it has been out for so long? Do you think they would actually ever errata it??

Only allowing one copy per deck is a terrible balancing mechanism, and is currently only printed on cards for thematic reasons.

 

Basically, making it so you could only have one copy in each deck vastly increases the variance. In some games, you'll have it in your opening hand, and get that useful ability right away.

 

In others, it will be the last card in your deck and you'll never see it.

 

In which case, your deck will have to be solid enough to perform without UC, so why would you bother to have the single copy?

 

I don't think they'll ever restrict Unexpected Courage in this way. It's a very good card, but it's not an auto-include. Rohan Warhorse is very niche, it's true, and Miruvor is just weird in general. But Light of Valinor, Fast Hitch, and Cram are all very good, and fit better in a lot of decks than Unexpected Courage. And they're cheaper. And they don't require you to be playing Spirit.

I dont like include single copies in my deck. It becomes a question of lucky, not of technic.

 

Only i use once: Needpath, and including 3 copies of Word of Command to search for it.

I disagree completely. There are many ways to come around this problem -- if you really want to. Master of the Forge, for instance, with him I only get a single copy of each attachment, expect those I want in play multiple times. It actually improves your deck, not otherwise, having a unique attachment in there only once. And there are other ways, and there will be more, the search mechanic is expanding at the very moment (or cycle, I should say).

 

Overall, this is has been up-and-down discussion. And I think we can see two ways of looking at it. The OP had a main point being UC is better than any other readying tool in the game. And it is hard to argue against it. It is why I fully support errata, and I even believe we might get it one day because the current designers are much more careful in making over-powered cards (Outlands aside).

Outlands are not overpowered, they are just straightforward, as the Unexpected Courage is.

I don't think Outlands are overpowered in general. Although I do think the outlands card that adds HP was a mistake (the deck should have been weak to 1 or 2 damage to all ally cards - and if you get those hp increasing allies out it's very unlikely you'll get chipped down again.

The deck would also be weak to wrath effects (from MtG) but we don't have any of those in this game. They are the main counter to Slivers though (The MtG version of Outlands).

From a design point of view in any case UC is clearly in a worse position in terms of dictating design than the Outlands cards - the main problem of the outlands cards is that you have to be very careful when adding any new ones, because of the additive effect. However you can very easily modulate the power of Outlands by only adding one or two new cards every couple of cycles which makes them a good way of keeping a simple power curve and letting new players always have a deck that's competitive.

Any card at the top of the power curve for a given type is going to dictate design. At a fundamental level any new card needs to either be better than the old card (setting a new power level) or worse (filling a new niche). UC is supremely powerful for very low cost - meaning that all other ready effects have to try to fill new niches with very limited design variation. 

This is why all the ready effects follow a similar pattern; cost 0 and discard or cost 1 with limited triggers on the actions that can be taken and when the ready effect can occur.

UC hurts the design so much because all effects can be replaced by UC if they want them to cost 2.

As an example - The silvan design of characters entering and leaving play would mean that a ready effect for silvan characters tied to entering and leaving play would be pretty good. The same card for hobbits only would be comparatively worse and should therefore be cheaper. This is because the hobbit play style wouldn't support the ready effect nearly as well.

The hobbit ready effect for characters leaving play being cheaper would be quite powerful only in circumstances where you combined Silvan and hobbits - now that allows us to create a card that encourages cross racial deck instead of a single racial design.

Additionally we can see that ready effects on hobbits are generally less valuable (they have worse stats so add less on every action) so we can cost the ready effects for them with that in mind.

On the other hand their really isn't the flexibility in only two costs (0 and 1), and we're quite limited in what we can do by the fact that UC can target any hero. While that made sense at the start of the design (because we didn't have the card pool to run strategies that were based on traits).

At this point UC is doing more damage than good - although I do think that the point that UC is still useful in the core set and for those with reduced card pools is a very valid one.

Which is why rather than banning the card I now favour a new idea. Which is extending the idea of normal and easy modes from the adventure decks into the player card pool.

By having some of the important cards that make the core set playable still available we won't disadvantage people that play with the early card pool.

However by allowing the designers to set the new player cards as being designed for the "tournament" (maybe "collectors") standard - we would be able to have cards that are just worse than UC added into the card pool (because the later cycles would be expected to be played by collectors or people that are quite devoted to the game). 

These worse cards however would better fit the design of an expanding card pool and I feel this is an essential adjustment that needs to be made if we want this game to have a long life.

I support the idea of errating the card text to include "Limit 1 per deck", but expanding the scope of "Easy Mode" to include the lifting of this restriction.  I understand that it sounds like a lot of unnecessary back-and-forth, particularly on a game that is not inherently competitive.  However, such a measure would do two things.  First, it would provide players the challenge they want from the encounter decks.  I think most would agree that consistently steamrolling an encounter deck is not much fun.  The fun comes (IMHO) from overcoming a deck that, under different conditions, could easily beat you.  Limiting cards that are at least perceived as OP contributes to this definition of "fun".  Second, it allows for the use of multiple copies when a different, established format is used (Easy Mode).  I admit, I like this aspect for purely selfish reasons.  I already play Easy Mode encounter decks, due to the restrictions I have placed on myself.  Could I afford to buy all the LotR content FFG produces?  Sure.  But I have decided to invest my resources elsewhere.  This is a choice, and I accept whatever consequences this choice carries (including more difficulty completing recently-released quests).  However, a lot of players make different choices, and this ruling would, I believe, cater to both camps.

 

There has been a lot of good discussion on this thread, and I think the TC really hit on something that members of this community feel strongly about.  I hope the discussion continues.

My solution:

 

Start including a new treachery card in all future scenarios and nightmare packs:

 

"False Courage"

 

When Revealed:  Deal 3 damage to each hero for each copy of Unexpected Courage attached to that hero.  This effect cannot be canceled.

I do not think Unexpected Courage will ever receive errata.  With that said I still think there is much room for making cards with readying abilities despite UC seeming to be "the best" readying ability.  Remember that it is restricted to heroes only and it is in the Spirit sphere meaning some decks may not want or be able to use it.  I can imagine many more cards with readying abilities being made for the future showing that Unexpected Courage maybe really isn't that bad for the health of the game...

 

1) Currently some of the newer cards such as Rohan Warhorse and Wingfoot show a cheap (1 cost) attachment with restrictions as to who can equip it and how it actually readies that character.  I like these because they are cheap, thematic and seem balanced but are maybe a little difficult to use hence costing only 1 resource. For only one more resource one could have UC to ready at any time so it does seem superior but I am still perfectly fine with restricted 1 cost readying attachments.

 

2) How about readying attachments that can go on characters (or even allies only) that cost more, 3 or even 4 resources but also have a little bonus making them better than UC:

Tactics attachments- Attach to a Tactics character, that character gets +1 attack when (card name) is exhausted. Exhaust (card name) to ready character.

 

Lore attachment- Attach to a Lore character. Draw one card when (card name) enters play. Exhuast (card name) to ready character.

 

Spirit attachment- Attach to a Spirit character. Attached character gets +1 willpower when (card name) is exhausted. Exhaust (card name) to ready character

 

Leadership attachment- Attach to a Leadership character. When (card name) enters play add 1 resource to a hero you control. Exhaust (card name) to ready character.

 

All of these rough examples I would happily include in whatever sphere deck I am playing and I would be perfectly happy paying more for an attachment that can be put on characters or also if it gives a little boost to something and especially if it is in a sphere that I am using.

 

 

So... does the Unexpected Courage card being a 2 cost Spirit attachment restricted to heroes still seem bad for the health of the game pertaining to readying abilities?? I think not so much.. there still seems to be so many options!  ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

Last game, i had Glorfindel with valinor, Bilbo with fast switch, and Grima. One friend put in table a copy of UC and he said: who wants? I said: me not, i dont need.

I disliked to say: ok, good for me. Of course it is good, for Glorfindel 2 attacks, Bilbo defend another time (he had Brand attached, Protector Lorien, etc)..., but: i disliked pay 2 resources (from a friend) for one ready effect that you dont know if you would need. Better to play another card with another advantatges.

 

PD: we were 3 players. It was attached finally on Eleanor (you wonder, for cancel and defend -without any attachments-, unexpecte became totally useless), and we did higscore in 3 players: 99 score (in Journey Anduin).

Verdict: UC is not overpowered, in fact, if you know how to use another cards it can even become useless

1) The issue is the question of whether all these new ready effects should be cost 1 or 0. Rohan Warhorses is undeniably cost 1 in power and I feel that Wingfoot is also. However compare to some of the better alternative cards (Light of Valinor, Steed of the Mark) - the problem is not with the cards you listed but with the fact that the stronger ready effects all need to be cost 1 as well.

2) This is possible card design direction. We certainly will get these cards eventually (we have them in event form now). However the point at issue is not that I could invent a better card - I can already tell you some more expensive cards with stronger effects exist. How about Light The Beacons (cost 5, all characters get +2 defence and do not exhaust to defend this round) or We Do Not Sleep (cost 5, rohan characters do not exhaust to quest this round).

Both of these cards are stronger because they effect many characters, they also provide additional effects. They also illustrate my rebuttal of your point 1 nicely. Being able to not exhaust to quest is much better than being able to not exhaust to defend (because not all readies are equal, questing is clearly stronger than other stages). So to make these cards both cost 5 the first one has no restrictions and a bonus +2 to stats, the second has restricted targeting and no bonuses.

You could theoretically make a Super UC that is cost 3 or 4 with no target restrictions or has effects like you describe (ready and get + other stats). However at cost 3 or 4 you're almost never going to want to play that card on an ally because they're too vulnerable and paying extra for the other bonus, while an acceptable card design - doesn't effect the basic cost of readying in terms of card costing.

As a final point I would argue that having off-sphere versions of cards is itself bad for the game. I don't want to see Unexpected style (the tactics UC) Unexpected Orders (the Leadership UC) and Unexpected Insight (the lore UC) - even if each of these cards had to cost 3 or 4. That's not really good for the design of the game or it's future.

You need to have layers of interaction in your design to maintain interest and a long life - as an example I want "Rohan" to have a certain style of play and currently it does. I further want "Spirit Rohan" and "Tactics Rohan" to also be distinct from each other - because I want spheres and traits to be different I don't want to accept sphere-swapped cards too often.

Also you're still only talking about having a single aspect of design in each direction (down for basic ready effects, or adding new extra bits on if you go up), you really lack the nuances that you could have just by removing UC. (We could have had ready effects in the quest phase costed at +1 for example, you could have more easily modulated ready effects in off-sphere or with restricted targeting).

I'm not of the opinion that Unexpected Courage is the most overpowered thing in the game (it isn't). I'm of the opinion that it's the most overpowered thing in the game that's doing as much damage to potential design.

Last game you had two ready effects that have to be cost 1 because UC existed when those cards were designed (and if they were cost 2 they would 'almost' be just worse - Valinor not having the exhaust effect at all is sometimes better). So you're basically saying in your example that because UC has 'already' made Valinor too cheap you now don't need UC (and don't even try to pretend that card should be cost 1).

Also having already drawn into 2 ready effects it's a bit different to say "hey I don't need UC" - you almost certainly would have wanted it if you didn't already have multiple actions. Most characters get diminishing returns on multiple actions after all (defence and attack don't diminish if you're fighting a swarm, but in most scenarios they do).

I agree with you that UC might not have been needed at all if your friends had similar board states.  However I don't think your argument shows UC is not too good in it's design - I actually think it shows exactly what I'm talking about. Other cards are forced into cost 1 when they shouldn't be (Valinor, maybe fast hitch - although hobbits are stats weak).

## 70 [Catastrophic09 on May 2, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/104499-the-problem-of-unexpected-courage/?do=findComment&comment=1069673)

Ok so basically as you mentioned in the OP, Unexpected Courage should have only ever been a test card representing the power of readying abilities, but the fact that it became an actual card at the low cost of 2 is a huge problem for obvious design reasons for future cards. Then being limited with readying ability attachments Light of Valinor should have cost 2 for how powerful it is but it doesn't because UC cost 2 and UC would then be the obvious superior choice (beside Spirit Glorfindels ridiculous synergy with LoV).  

 

I see two main problems: 1) early cards from the core such as UC and Steward of Gondor are more powerful than they should be for their cost simply because it was early in the game and the designers weren't as good as they are now with making balanced cards (not that we can blame them, they are doing amazing) but there really should be some errata for many cards- too many cards and that's why I think many won't receive errata.   and...

2) a lot of powerful cards came out during the Dwarrowdelf cycle, Light of Valinor, Spirit Glorfindel, Lore Aragorn, Warden of Healing, and Lure of Moria to name a few. and I think all of these powerful cards were dangerous for the game because now suddenly scenarios needed to be made more difficult to combat powerful player cards and future player cards can only be stronger otherwise players will be mad buying packs with weak cards in comparison to what they have.  I think they overdid many player cards from the Dwarrowdelf cycle (yes they are awesome and powerful, I enjoy them) but the developers had to ease up and stop making such powerful cards and that seems pretty clear from the Against the Shadow cycle. A natural part of this game is the power creep but the balance was sped up a bit too much from the Dwarrowdelf cycle.

 

So basically from the beginning of the game and at times (Dwarrowdelf cycle) many cards were made too powerful harming future options for card developing but there are so many of these cards doing an errata for them all would be way too much, after all errata is only reserved for cards that truly break the current game, not to help future development because the designers are just going to design around current cards and they are good at doing that.

 

Few, I'm done rambling and this has been an interesting discussion. I think I understand why you see UC as a problem but I don't think it will receive errata just because it's not game breaking and too many other power cards should receive errata along with UC if it were to. Therefore we'll just have the problem of 1 cost readying attachments not all being equal but whatever this game can't be perfect, UC does cramp development but the developers will do the best they can with what they have.

My friend and I often save all copies of UC for just one hero - Beregond.  It feels cheap, but considering all the Gondor synergy available, stacking up Beregond is just always better than spreading things around.

I don't think UC is a big deal.

 

Most games only last 10 turns so you rarely see more than one UC in a game.

 

It's definitely a powerful card, but not game breaking or as game design limiting as some people are making out.

All cards are rarely seen because of games only lasting 10 turns? I mean I don't understand how this supports your final point. This applies equally to every card in the game?

As for not having a tournament scene - this argument is that we can self-select what cards we use or don't use so it doesn't matter?

That entirely disregards the design point of view - that would only make sense if I was complaining that UC was too good from the point of view of making quests too easy. (From that point of view it is a valid argument) but I'm much more concerned with the game's future than it's present.

I don't think anyone is trying to convince you to believe UC is not overpowered, that ship has sailed.  I just like to be pragmatic, and I think what this thread is waiting on is an idea that the whole community can/would embrace for how to deal with the design issue.  Personnaly I think a reboot of sorts could do wonders for this game and encourage people to buy a new/updated core set.  The problem is those that invested in two or three cores will have alot of useless cardboard if cards are errata'd across the board.  My suggestion?  Use this as an opportunity to take out weak core set cards that don't see use anyway (there are numerous threads about these, Power in the Earth, Brok Ironfist just to name two) and replace with the errata'd versions of overpowered cards outside of the original core set (Dain Ironfoot, anyone?).  I would rather pay for one more core set (since 3 copies of all player cards should be included) than see the game design stagnate, and this could help new players build their collections up with more useful cards right out of the shoot.  Another idea would be to call it a starter set or something similar and just take out the encounter cards altogether, thus encouraging new players to start with newer APs/boxes.

 

Just my two cents.

I like the idea of a second edition core set immensely (I feel many of the most poorly designed cards can be found in the core set, with only a handful of bad cards elsewhere).

I felt that it would be even harder to sell that concept than to sell a straight errata :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] .

I'm not sure that you should take cards from the AP's though (even though I think Dain and Spirit Glorfidendel could definitely do with being looked at in a reboot). The problem with that is that you discourge those packs from being bought or breed resentment.

It might be better if a new core was created that had new cards in place of some of the old ones - but you're still ultimately looking at banning old cards in the reboot.

As for discouraging people from buying the packs, that would be a tough problem to overcome, although if only the heroes were replaced in the reboot, I think it would soften this blow as people would stil likely want the other player cards.  Another benefit of a reboot would be to beef up cards if needed to make them more playable (Bilbo!!!).  Probably a pipe dream but I for one would shell out some cash for it and I think the people I play the game with would as well.

Shortly after I started playing the game, I bought a 2nd and 3rd copy of the core set, to have full sets of the player cards. Unexpected Courage was a big incentive to do that. I'd be really quite annoyed if it was now erratad to be unique, or restricted, or cost more, or one of the other variations people are suggesting. I'd been even more annoyed if that happened after i'd just started playing the game.

meh. don't get me wrong, i hate that the card exists (moreso because it's in Spirit than anything else though), but honestly, IIRC it's the only singleton in the Core Set that made me think about getting more than one. i haven't, but I think it's sensible that there are a few "chase rares" in the core set.

I just bought a core set but... having a reboot core set wouldn't sound too bad. I only bought the core set after watching some video reviews and reading the rulebook. I never bothered looking at what cards came with it, only knowing that it came with 4 starter decks and 3 scenarios and its encounter decks.

 

I like what Beorn wrote under "For the Future":

So far, every single thread about the newly revealed Galadriel and Nenya have referred to Unexpected Courage.

Typically it has been refereed to as an obvious power combo on her (which it is). Some people have commented on how it reduces the decision value when you get Nenya on her.

I have seen references to Miruvor as an alternative (which does combo nicely with her card draw - but still using Miruvor to ready and put it back on your deck at a cost of 1 resource a turn is reducing the value of the card draw by half and costing you 1 resource a turn).

I guess what I'm saying is that the response to a new cool spirit hero and combo is to instantly have people saying, Wow can't wait for Unexpected Courage! Which is exaclty what I'm talking about with reguard to it's relative power and influence on the card pool.

I feel this actual example we've just had may be better at convincing people than any of my mere theorizing.

I'd also like to thank everyone that's contributed to this discussion so far, discussing changing cards we already have is always a contentious topic but everyone has handled it with respect. So thanks for that :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Don't give yourself too much credit, unexpected courage is most famous and straightforward readying effect, and it's obvious that people will speak about it when a hero with two different exhausting actions comes up. And let's not forget that unlike most other readiers, every LotR LCG player owns Unexpected Courage (because, like, it's in the core set).

What are you talking about, give myself credit for what?

The point I'm making is that everyone instantly sees the value of UC as soon as any new hero with an exhaust effect turns up. People didn't think of that because I made a thread about UC - they thought about it because it's obvious.

It's obvious and powerful and uninteresting.

More obvious and powerful than any of the more limited and interesting options.

UC was always valuable asset, from the very first days of LotR LCG. 

 

Lets not talk about interesting or not. Powerful? Yes. Overpowered? Hell no.

 

Those options still persists and have place to be. UC is not going to solve every problem.

UC is more valuable than every other  card to come after it that has a single target ready effect - which is the problem.

Which is not, because UC is not neutral.

I do not see why is UC a good match for Galadriel. As I see it Galadriel is one of the least meaningful heroes to get enCouraged. Unless you get Nenya, it is completely wasted. And even if you do, you can only do two given things -- and never more unless there is some strange mechanic like the hide test. Plus, the powerful ally boost of Celeborn and Galadriel should be enough to keep Nenya as only the last resort. Since I proxied the card, I played dozen games with Galadriel, and in those I used Nenya for the willpower boost only four times, once in three games exactly. Ok, maybe harder quests will be a different story but as it is, this would make UC pretty much a wasted inclusion for Galadriel.

 

That said, I still totally support the errata. Elrond and Denethor are the two that really prove the point for me. With Elrond, you get Vilya and Courage and you go shopping for free. In a right deck, Courage is giving you incredible advantage of resources, action and power.

Which is what game is about: Building right deck. Lets errata Imladris Stargazer so you wouldn't be able to stage what you're going to play with Vilya, because it will give you incredible advantage of resources, action and power.

Based on this argument it's impossible for any card to be overpowered because it's all about building the right deck.

You seem to be willfully not acknowledging that some cards are more powerful than others - or that some cards might reach a level of power where they harm the game. (Despite the fact you made a thread about cards that you think are woefully under-powered).

UC is a single card - it works with absolutely any deck that runs any spirit at all. It's going to work regardless of traits, hero choices or any other restrictions that are in play on other cards to enhance deck building and make the game more interesting.

Yes you can build decks that don't need UC - however you cannot build a deck that doesn't want hero ready effects and not conclude that UC is the best 'unless' your game is going to last 1 or 2 turns. 

The issue isn't that ready effects are a problem (they're not) The issue is that UC is so much better than all other single target ready effects that it's too powerful. The card design in fact is just too powerful in a game that's meant to be about deck building because it will fit into any spirit deck.

Why being sarcastic now? Or is it? Hard to tell. But no, Stargazer is not a very universally powerful card, without Vilya or Zigil or Treasure-hunter, it does very little actually. And once you use it once, the next time you get a much more limited effect. Courage, on the other hand, is universally useful, for many heroes, and worst of all, none of the other reading effects challenge its superiority.

It is possible. Example: Gandalf. Because of his "enters play" text. How many competitve leadership decks do not feature him with sneak attack? None. And now this new event-replaying tome of leadership.

 

The UC is non-arguably more powerful than, say, Steed of the Mark. Yet, it's not overpowered and needs no errata. Mount can be fetched (and something tells me, this is not the last mount-utility we shall see), you need less resources to attach it, so if you're playing it on another player, you're effectively spending 1. 

 

Actually, you can. A deck that does not has spirit.

 

 

lleimmien, you underestimate the power to choose the next card you're going to draw too much.

Let us not just call things out. You can but you may end up sounding like a fool. I do not underestimate Stargazer's ability in any way. I have clearly argued that Courage is much more universal in its use. I have played Stargazer for two years now in many a deck but she has fallen out of each that did not have either of the three cards I mentioned above, actually, she seems really only worth it with Vilya. Without it, the utility is still not bad, I am not saying that, but with the current card pool, there are more useful cards than one trick ponies allies of 1hp. To compare it to Courage that is hard not to justify in a majority of Spirit decks, that makes no sense to me.

> You seem to have missed my point, but I'm too lazy to explain it in depth to you.

 

This kind of dismissive one line response seems to be something you eventually fall back to in every thread.

I don't see evidence that people have missed your point. Yes it's possible for us to reach different conclusions, you think that UC is better than every other single target ready effect but that it has an acceptable power level - ultimately if you think the power level of the card is okay you must think that all the other ready effects are therefore worse.

Which means you're either happy with many worse options proliferating in the game - or else you don't mind wasted cards (which goes against another thread of yours entirely).

In all the cases you've ever listed in this thread multiple cards are required for the effect - stargazer + other cards, mount + mount fetch cards.

Even with the mount fetch cards you're still talking about a two card combo that helps you to get a worse effect into play, none of the mounts are comparable to UC in power. 

Sneak attack + Gandalf is a powerful combo to mention. However this still requires more cards - has a totally different effect (for threat reduction it probably is in the overpowered region) but primiarily all these examples don't make any difference to your argument.

I never claimed that UC was the strongest effect in the game, I merely claimed that it's so much better than all other ready effects as to be overpowered (or we could assume instead that all the other card ready effects are too weak, but that seems like the stupid way round to think when all those other effects are also good and all fill the ready role just as well) 

That's the thing - you don't play stead of the mark and think, hey this card is awful, you think, hey this is going to help (ready effects are good after all). That's why UC is overpowered - it's just better than cards that are perfectly good.

This one line was not addressed to you. 

 

If you don't see the evidence, then you have missed the point yourself. And you have a bad habit of answering with walls of text to a simple statements, while you can easily boil down everything to one paragraph. It would be easier to communicate verbally. But writing walls of text in response to walls of text on regular basis is something I consider not worth it.

I find walls of text are more precise than single paragraphs. They're not always as easy to read (especially for those with English as a second language), however they often contain more than a single paragraph could.

You may find that writing precisely is more worthwhile if you were less interested in dismissing other people's points of view and more interested in making your own clear. Instead you just insist that you are being clear when you just repeat yourself over and over, and maybe it's my fault for not getting something that you find obvious - but that's why you should take the time to write it out more clearly for me, or if you feel it isn't of worth, just stop I guess. 

I am happy to keep discussing points with you, if you want to continue to make them instead of just being insulting like your one paragraph here.
