Sorry about unclear topic, but i came about this situation, when playing over the misty mountains grim guest

If there are two stone giants at the staging area and galloping boulders is revealed from the encounter deck, does that surge activate twice?

No, only once. Galloping boulders gain surge (no surge 2, or surge 3) even if it is triggered by more than 1 reasons.
