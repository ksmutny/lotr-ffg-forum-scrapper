Hello all, just for fun I tried to enumerate how people play the game.

The list is divided in three components (player number, deck construction and campaign) which are to be combined.

 

Here you go:

 

 * Player number:
   
   * Solo
     
     * True Solo (1 deck)
     
     * 2-handed
     
     * 3-handed (!? Do anybody play this on a regular basis?)
     
     * 4-handed (!? ditto)
   
   * Multiplayer
     
     * 2 Players
     
     * 3 Player
     
     * 4 Players
     
     * 2 player two-handed
   
   * Keeping count variant

 * Deck construction:
   
   * Thematic open (no thematic concerns, both in terms of player card and quest type e.g. eagles in Moria)
     
     * Unlimited (all the card pool)
     
     * Progression style (only cards released at the time of quest first release)
     
     * Cycle style (only cards from Core + relative Deluxe Espansion and AP cycle)
     
     * Progression/Cycle style (only cards from Core + every Deluxe and AP release up to that point)
     
     * Bear's draft
   
   * Thematic
     
     * Strictly thematic: only cards that fits Tolkien's Lore
     
     * Loosely thematic: some unthematic addition are tolerated for gameplay reasons

 * Campaign:
   
   * Saga Campaign
   
   * Banania's campaign
   
   * Basic campaign? (all deluxe + AP of a cycle with the same deck)

Did I miss something?

Multiplayer twohanded -  2 by 2? (never played, but seems the most interesting combination, two brains yet 2 decks and 6 heroes per brain)

Though rare due to the set-up involved, you might consider Hall of Beorn's Draft Style a play-style under Deck Construction. I've not played this way, but it sounds fun.

Yes! I thought of that but forgot to add

Not sure if you are interested in adding difficulty level as well?

Easy, Normal, Nightmare and Seastan mode where you play a nightmare quest and reveal twice as many encounter cards than you should during staging  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

It is! Next version should be up very soon and have thoroughly playtested with a friend this summer (at least 40 scenarios about 80 games).

We played that Loosely Thematic, we always do.

I agree that difficulty is something to consider. Some people refuse to play things like outlands or the Gandalf hero or Spirit Glorfindel or Boromir decks or Hama feint recyclers because they consider those to be OP like cheating. Other people are entirely comfortable with breaking the game. In fact, that is their goal. Some people play for self expression, like deckbuilding is their artistic medium. Others play for the story, others play for puzzle solving, and still others are not players as much as collectors who like having a complete set of everything (including alternate art and play mats).
