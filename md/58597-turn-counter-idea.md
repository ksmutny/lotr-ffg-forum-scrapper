Had an idea the other day that I think would be cool.

 

Since scoring now requires you to keep track of turns, what if the 1st player token had a counter like the threat dials.  In a single player game its just another dial to use.  In a multiplayer game you up the turn number when you pass the first player token.

 

I might just glue a first player token onto a spare threat dial for my purposes but it FFG ever has room in an expansion for something like this I'd be into it.
