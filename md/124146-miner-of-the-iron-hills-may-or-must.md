# [Miner of the Iron Hills: may or must?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/124146-miner-of-the-iron-hills-may-or-must/)

Miner of the Iron Hills reads:

 

"Response: after Miner of the Iron Hills enters play, choose and discard 1 Condition attachment from play"

 

Is this a comupulsory action? What if the only Condition in play is The Favor of the Lady, for instance? Or anything boosting your characters instead of burdening them with a malus of some kind? Should I remove the positive condition if it's the only one in play?

 

Thanks for help

Rulebook p.23:

"Responses are always optional, and can 

be triggered by their controller in response to (i.e. 
immediately after) a specified game occurrence. "

Thanks, I missed that one. It has sense :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

(or maybe I missed it since I don't have any pag 213 in my rulebook? :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] joking. Thanks a million!)
