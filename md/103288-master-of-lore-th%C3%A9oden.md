Well Done!

 

Really enjoyed your deck at the end too.  Going to try and build it right now.

Yet again a great article mate!

I don't often reply to your lore tidbits, but wanted to let you know I always enjoy them.

Always looking forward towards the next entry, and I appreciate the effort you put in it for us by browsing through all that "history"

So, keep up the good work! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
