Hi all.

Usually there would be an article or something released regarding the Gen Con event, similar to what was done for Arkham Horror LCG (but that was on Facebook), but I’m not seeing it on the main site and it’s happening next week.

Has any additional information been released regarding the specific alt art and playmat?

As far as I know, there were no updates on the main page, but there was a post on facebook spoiling the new alt art (Lore Bilbo), and the new playmat (Bilbo and Gollum doing riddles). It is strange that we got a playmat this year, but it looks great, so I'm not complaining.

Awesome. Thanks for the pointer. That was exactly what I was looking for. I think previous years we got placemats as well for Gen Con events. This one looks gorgeous.
