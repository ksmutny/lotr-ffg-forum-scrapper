When Revealed: Remove 1 progress token from each location in play. Then, discard the top card of each player's deck for each progress token removed by this effect.

Totally confused i thought you could only have one active location at a time therefore wouldnt we only ever be removing one progress token/card?

There are plenty of cards that can add progress to locations while they're in the staging area. For instance: Northern Tracker.
