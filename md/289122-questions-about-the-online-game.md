They are preparing to release another campaign (5 scenarios) and new heroes & player cards, then after that there should be a co-op mode added.

Yep. The coop is ready, but They desided to tweak it more before EA release. There were Are some balance issues with coop that They try to take better in consideration (difficulty scaling etc.)
