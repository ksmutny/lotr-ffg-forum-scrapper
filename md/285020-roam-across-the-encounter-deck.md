Hi, just received my copy of Roam across Rhovanion. For building the encounter deck , there is a mismatch between the information sheet and the quest cards.  The info sheet says to build the encounter deck with Fell Beasts, Lost in Wilderland and Hills of Wilderland, the quest cards all show the symbols for Fell Beasts, Gathering Gloom and Hills of Wilderland. I am assuming the sheet is correct - but does anyone know for sure?

This has happened before twice in the Dwarrowdelf cycle. In that case, the icons from the rules insert and quest cards were correct, and the names of the sets in the rules insert were wrong.

I would use Lost in the Wilderness over Gathering Gloom, though.

Yes, I was aware of the switch in set names in The Long Dark and Foundations of Stone (it's still not been corrected in the copy of the inserts on the product page), which was what in part prompted the question.

I agree - Lost in Wilderland does seem a better fit for the scenario. Thanks for the response!

This came up at Con of the Rings, and Caleb said that the rules insert was correct (so Lost in the Wilderness).

Wait, so the icon is actually wrong on the quest card?

While Calebs decision is what you should go with, does that not break the golden rule, that the cards overrule the rulebook?

The icon on the quest card is incorrect. It will almost certainly appear in the next round of errata.

Unless of course the card is just plain wrong, that's what errata is for.

Man that's a pretty awful mistake.  I would bet a significant chunk of players just play it wrong for years without knowing.

I think the mistake have been corrected for my french version, witch is a nice surprise :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]. It also mean that the error have been detected but no reported anywhere :/. It is annoying for anyone with the english version so thanks for mentioning it!

I agree, it's obviously an incorrect printing and will probably be errata'd (in fact, if you contact Asmodee you can probably get replacements).

Would be interesting to know how much difference it makes to the quest, mind.  If you found a deck built for that quest and used it with the wrong set of encounter cards, would it make much difference to the efficiency of the deck?

If I'm looking at the right encounter sets, it looks like Lost in the Wilderness treacheries are substantially worse than Gathering Gloom treacheries.  But aside from affecting the quest difficulty, I wouldn't expect that it would matter to a deck built specifically for that quest.

The Lost in Wilderland set seems to fit the theme of the quest better - although, as Dale points out, they are the tougher treachery set of the two.

Thanks for the replies - it's appreciated!

Reminds me on Quickbeam Hero, in German he is unique, in English he is not.

Yep. He also have the unique symbol in french. Some cards are fixed with the translation. What is a little bit sad is that sometime foreign version come out on the same time that the english version, with some correction. I understand that english cards were probably printed before the error was mentioned. But it could be better for us that FFG ask for translation before printing the products, so they can have a feedback.
