 Or we always discard Gandalf card after use?

Sneak Attack causes you to return an ally card at the end of "the phase". Gandalf's card states "at the end of a round". If you still have Gandalf in play at the end of any phase, due to Sneak Attack, then he is returned to your hand.

Gandalf is only discarded if he is killed or stays in play for an entire round (all 7 phases).

Do you mean 3xSneak Attack + 3x Gandalf? Can't have 3x Gandalf + 3x Gandalf in a deck (since there are now two Gandalves lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif] ).

It's not any phase, it's the phase where you played him using Sneak Attack.

 

Gandalf cannot be in play for 7 rounds due to the fact that you can only play him (without Sneak) on phase 2, so he will only stay until the end of the round which occurs on phase 7.

 

In fact the combo, Sneak Attack + Core Gandalf is one of the most used and better combos of the game.

 It's great that you have to choose between Questing and Combat… unless you want to pay full price for him. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

From page 9 of the rules:

"No more than three copies of any ally, attachment, or
event card, by title, can be included in a player’s deck."
