It seems this useful-looking tool was released just today. I am very excited to see this, had no time to check it out yet, though. Anyone made any experiences with this?

Looks cool. I'll give it at try tonight. Thanks for sharing :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Will card images be coming soon?

 

Edit: Nevermind, I see that getting the art is a 3.99$ purchase. That's not bad.

I think that's a question for the developer ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

Looks like they're only up through The Steward's Fear right now

Okay. Tried it a little now and that's where it stays. Some people will likely find it a good tool. The fact that you don't get any pictures just ruins it for me. Why have the card layout at all then? And I don't like that the cards are all listed alphabetically. Rather sorted by sets/cycles. But that's all my opinion.

Wake me up when somebody makes such app for Android. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I downloaded this the other day just to check it out.

 

$3.99 wouldn't be a terrible deal if:

- I wasn't using this app on the small screen of an iPod, the graphics would be even smaller

- This app was completely up to date instead of just at the Steward's Fear 

 

Maybe this is the first stepping stone placed in the path leading to the creation of a LotR:LCG iOS game though.  I recently purchased Elder Sign: Omens, and even though it's about 10x harder than its board game counterpart, it is still very fun and the production values are pristine.

I tried it on an iPad and I wasn't impressed. I like the idea of cause but with no pictures of the cards I wouldn't pay anything.

I had some time to check this app out, too and see much room for improvement. I suppose it is quite likely that the developer will continue to improve this?

 

At the moment I think the requirement of an internet connection limits the functionality of the app severly. Plus all the other points mentioned of course. It might still be worth keeping an eye on this and see how this develops, though!

It appears quite likely that this app will be pulled soon.

Really sorry to find out that due to copyright infringing this app was removed from AppStore and it will be no further updated. Hope FFG will realese one soon.

Not available outside the US, unfortunately. Would love an official software like this.

I'm hoping so as well. With FFG acquiring CardGameDB, you would think it shouldn't be too hard to get a deck builder app out there.
