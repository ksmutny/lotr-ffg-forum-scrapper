# [What would the Fellowship of the Ring look like in other LCGs](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/233628-what-would-the-fellowship-of-the-ring-look-like-in-other-lcgs/)

## 1 [987654321 on October 29, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/233628-what-would-the-fellowship-of-the-ring-look-like-in-other-lcgs/?do=findComment&comment=2480478)

This is kind of an idea for some forum fun. Feel free to answer with your own version of those or other characters, in any LCG(or better: in any format!). Since I somehow can't install Strange Eons I will just write it down.

 

A Game of Thrones LCG

 

Frodo Baggins

5 cost

 

Intrigue

Power

3 STR

Hobbit. Ringbearer. The Fellowsip.

Stealth.

Interrupt:Kneel a The Fellowship character to save a character you control.

 

Frodo is basically the Punching Ball of the bad guys, while the rest of the team has to save him. I begin with that and decide he will be more nice if he granted that option to others.

 

Sam Gamgee

4 cost

Military

Intrigue

 

3 STR

Hobbit. The Fellowship.

Interrupt:When another character you control would be killed, stand Sam Gamgee to save it. If that character is Frodo Baggins, Sam Gamgee gets +2STR until the end of the phase.

 

Sam Gamgee got the first rank of my favourite book characters(shared with Tyrion Lannister) because it's just a normal guy who just wants to protect his master. The ability was pretty easy from that.

 

Pippin

2 cost

 

Intrigue

 

2 STR

Hobbit. The Fellowship.

Stealth.

Reaction:After you win an unopposed challenge in which Pippin participated, draw a card.

 

The FOAT helped Frodo and Sam to get to Buckleberry Ferry unnoticed, so I had to do something with Stealth.

 

Merry

2 cost

Military

Intrigue

 

2 STR

Hobbit. The Fellowship.

Stealth.

Challenges action:Kneel your faction card to put Merry into play, knelt and commited to a challenge in which you are participating. You may pay 2 gold to choose a character controlled by your opponent at that challenge. If you do so, uncommit it to the challenge.

 

This ability is based on Merry's epic moment. 'Nough said.

 

Aragorn

6 cost

 

 

 

5 STR

Dúnedain. The Fellowship.

Cannot have more than one Title card attached.

Reaction:After Aragorn enters play, search your hand, deck and discard pile for a Title attachment, and put it into play attached to him. Shuffle your deck.

 

Thorongil

2 cost

Title.

Aragorn only.

Aragorn gains a Military icon, Renown and the Warrior trait.

 

Strider

2 cost

Title.

Aragorn only.

Aragorn gains an Intrigue icon, Stealth and the Ranger trait.

 

Elessar

2 cost

Title.

Aragorn only.

Aragorn gains a Power Icon, Insight and the Noble trait.

 

Since Aragorn did multiple identity changes in the story, it seemed me cool to do that.

 

Legolas

4 cost

Military

 

Power

4 STR

Silvan. Noble. Warrior. The Fellowship

While you control at least one Dwarf character, Legolas gets +1STR. If that character is Gimli, he also gains Insight.

 

Gimli

4 cost

Miltary

 

Power

4 STR

Dwarf. Warrior. The Fellowship.

While you control at least one Silvan character, Legolas gets +1STR. If that character is Gimli, he also gains Intimidate.

 

Legolas and Gimli really complemented each other, sooooooooooooooooo surprise surprise they also do here!

 

Boromir

3 cost

Military

 

Power

5 STR

Gondor. Noble. Warrior. The Fellowship.

Intimidate. Renown.

Forced Reaction:After a challenge ends in which Boromir participated, put a corruption token on him. Then, discard the top card of your deck. If that card's cost is equal or lower to the number of corruption tokens he has, sacrifice him and kneel a character you control.

 

Boromir is a powerful ally, but as longer you get how less trustworthy he becomes. You'll never know when he will hurt you bad.

 

Gandalf

7 cost

Military

Intrigue

Power

6 STR

Istari. The Fellowhsip.

Reaction:After you win a challenge in which Gandalf participated, reveal the top 5 cards of your deck. Choose one to add it to your hand, one to discard, one to shuffle into your deck, one to put at the top of your deck and one to put at the bottom.

 

And, finally, Gandalf is a scryer to find your combo pieces.

Wow, you really took your time with these.

 

With Frodo, I'd change the text to "Kneel other Fellowship character to save Frodo."

Good point, but I wanted to make him somewhat more useful.

Also, yesterday I saw Arrow Season 4 episode 5 and there was a character named...John Constantine.

Well, I am obviously a fan of that character :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

You're pretty far behind if you've seen that episode just yesterday, ain't ya?

Plus he's been a comicbook character for years.

Aaaaaaand we continue with...

Android:Netrunner LCG

 

Nothing, cause they can't handle computers.

Of course they can handle computers. Gandalf can do it without hands, using his super mind power!

Frodo will find all back-doors and Sam will prevent meat damage...

Computers are much easier than for example palantirs to use!

I'm planning on covering other LCGs later, but at this moment I still need to think a bit too much  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] . Anyway, since Star Wars LCG works using groups of cards rather than putting them individually in your deck, I have made one just for the pleasure.

 

Gifts from Rivendell

Objective.

Rivendell.

1 resource

5 damage capacity

Reaction:after you play an enhancement, draw a card.

 

Bilbo Baggins

Character.

2 force

white tactics

Hobbit.

Reaction:after you play Bilbo Baggins, search your deck for an enhancement, reveal it, and add it to your hand. Shuffle your deck.

1 damage capacity

 

Sting

Enhancement.

3 cost

3 force

Weapon.

Enhance a friendly Character unit.

Enhanced unit gains black blast damage and white blast damage.

Reaction:after an Orc unit enters play. focus this enhancement to draw a card.

 

Mithril Ring Mail

Enhancement.

2 cost

2 force

Armor.

Enhance a friendly Character unit.

Reaction: focus this enhancement to prevent up to 2 damage assigned to enhanced character.

 

Bilbo's Living Room

Enhancement.

1 cost

1 force

Rivendell.

Enhance your play area. Limited.

1 resource

 

Well Equipped

Fate.

2 force

7 fate

Remove 1 token (any type) from a unit or objective card you control with 1 or more enhancements on it. 

 

As you see, this objective set is centered around enhancements (attachments). It encourages them in many ways, and helps searching from them thanks to Bilbo.
