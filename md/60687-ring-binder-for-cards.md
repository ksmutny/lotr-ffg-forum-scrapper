Hi guys, i have been looking unsuccessfully for days now in FFG shop site, ebay, amazon etc for a ring binder to put my cards in. I am sure there is one out there with the clear plastic A4 sleeves . Each sleeve can hold a dozen or so cards. Im fed up of rubber banding them together in the box, it would be great to scan through a binder and pick out my deck that way. Does anyone know of such a product out there?

Do you mean these: www.amazon.com/Ultra-Pro-3-Ring-D-Ring-Collectors/dp/B000C0V9EE/ref=pd_bxgy_sg_img_b [http://www.amazon.com/Ultra-Pro-3-Ring-D-Ring-Collectors/dp/B000C0V9EE/ref=pd_bxgy_sg_img_b]

You could also buy normal ring binders in every stationer and then buy one of those:

The problem i find with ultrapro is that they do not have enough room to sleeve the cards as well, so you need to sleeve every card every time you wish to use them.....

Ah, that could be a problem. The only other option would be to not sleeve the cards i suppose. Cheers

Thread necromancy!

There is a specialty brand of binder that holds sleeved cards; I forget the name right now. But, are the Ultrapro binder sleeves that much better for your cards or will any old binder sleeve do?
