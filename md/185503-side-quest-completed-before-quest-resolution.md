So I have Gather Information side quest in the staging area and at the beginning of the quest phase I choose it to be my active quest.

 

Then I play Quick Strike and Legolas kills something and completes the side quest. Now, does the quest switch back to the main quest? Or am I now in this situation where any progress I make this turn disappears?

All quest cards are the same progress does not carry over. Your done till next quest phase.

Yep. You can do the same with Asfaloth and win a side quest before the end of the questing phase! That could be advantageous (I don't know how exactly, but I know it can be... I just know...).

I wouldn't think of my example as trying to "carry over" anything. But regardless, Caleb gave me an answer.

> The rules for side quests say that at the beginning of the quest phase you must choose which quest stage will be the current quest until the end of the phase. So, if you defeat a side quest before the resolution of the quest phase, then you cannot make progress on any other quest stage.

How exactly would Asfaloth allow you to complete a side quest before the end of the quest phase...?

If you do not commit characters to quest (2nd part of your question), you will have to raise your threat by the amount of threat in staging area, because quest steps still resolve.... i think

Sorry seastan poor choice of words. Did not mean to mislead you. Thanks for posting the official rulings I was trying to relay the 2nd quote but missed the mark.

If Asfoloth makes you explore the active location and then you draw a treachery card during staging (or you draw a location during staging and explore it with Asfoloth before the end of the phase).

Neither of those things would have any impact on sidequests.
