We all know you lucky folks that went to Gencon had access to these three new nightmare decks and I'm sure many of you bought them.

Where be the spoilers yo? Your community needs you LOL

I'm sad by the spoiler we already got - I liked getting three quests for £14 a lot more than getting 3 quests for £18-21 (which is what 3 separate packs does to the cost :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png])
