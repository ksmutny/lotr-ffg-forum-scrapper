Hey all, I just received a big package in the mail which contains all the nightmare packs I had not gotten my hands on just yet including the new Road Darkens, Nin-in-Eilph, Antlered Crown and Celebrimbors Secret nightmare decks as well as Voice of Isengard and the first three from that cycle.

As soon as I get home from work in a few hours time I will take photos of the 4 packs we don't have full spoilers for and put them up on imgur! I am most excited to see the cards in the Road Darkens nightmare!

Cool! Looking forward to it.

Alright here we go, number one is Nightmare Nin-in-Eilph!

Not only does the nightmare card force you to put Ancient Marsh Dweller into play at Stage 2 AS WELL as at Stage 3... but there is also a new version of Quest Stage 2 and a new version of Quest Stage 3... both Treacherous Waters and An Arduous Journey look downright awful...

 

Quicksand is pretty interesting! Is this the first time that high willpower (3 or higher) rather than low willpower (2 or lower) characters have been targeted by encounter effects or am I forgetting something?

 

The deadly marsh adder and Swarms of mosquitoes are both pretty nasty too!

Nightmare Celebrimbor's Secret!

Bodyguards are insane..Dusty Labyrinth is pretty intense as well..
Closing in and Hateful Search are some truly terrible treacheries..

Man, those things look brutal! Also, so that was Bellach after all.

That Dunlending Horde has daunted me long since the original preview article... You either have enough attack to kill it right here, right now, or prepare for really, REALLY bad times x_x

 

Druid effect is cool.

Dunleding Horde shall be named "Seastan's Bane" from now on. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

> Not only does the nightmare card force you to put Ancient Marsh Dweller into play at Stage 2 AS WELL as at Stage 3...

This I think is the thing that scares me the most, possibly for all 3 of these nightmare quests. As horrible as they could be, hanging around on stage 2 to build up enough power to smash through to the end quickly was a potentially viable strategy in Nin-in-Eilph, partly because you didn't have to deal with the boss until stage 3.

Also the Deadly Marsh Adder kind of messes up my past feeling of "Defence isn't so important for NiE" by both having 4 attack and discarding damaged characters when it engages.

PsychoRocka, I'd love to see the nightmare Road Darkens cards whenever you get a chance to upload them.

## 11 [PsychoRocka on March 17, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/205643-nightmare-spoilers-incoming/?do=findComment&comment=2106947)

Some of the images are displaying very weirdly on imgur but anything that isn't the right way up, just zoom in and then out again and it'll correct itself! Sorry about the quality, enjoy!

The art for Nightmare The Road Darkens is superb. I'm not sure what the licensing issues around the art might be, but I hope that this game gets an art book like the one they recently released for Netrunner.

Ents allies for Nin-in-eliph sounds competitive

I still didn't play Road Darkest until now… box stay on shelf for almost 1 year now, waiting for Nightmare cards. Now soon I will play it at last!

## 16 [John Constantine on March 28, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/205643-nightmare-spoilers-incoming/?do=findComment&comment=2128164)

You're cool.

Still waiting...

I don't quite think psychorocka is obliged to answer a request made without a plead in a two days notice, 2 full months after he first gracefully took the time to offer us spoilers at all.
