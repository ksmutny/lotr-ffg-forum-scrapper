Is it ok to use expansion heroes in core set missions?

Yes, sure.

 

PD: there are players that like to play 'progression series' that it says: scenarios can't be played by player cards newer than the same scenario. But it is only a fan rule. Normal rules are ok with all the official cards released at the moment.

'Progression series' is a fan mode, not a normal tournament. But you can also say: 'my tournament' will be under 'progression series' mode. It could be funny.

But normally not. Tournaments usually are without progression series.
