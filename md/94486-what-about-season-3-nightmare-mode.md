I am really curious if anybody has obtained via tournament the 3 packs from NM season 3 (Emyn Muil, Dead Marshes and Return to Mirkwood).

 

Now that we're waiting for VoI, and after some great months of new packs/expansions, I'm eager to know more about those packs. I remember how in CotR they previewed each card from Season 2 some months ago, it was really great!

Yeah nightmare packs always give me the most thrill waiting for and playing.  Can't wait for all three of these.  So annoying that they cost so darn much for just a handful of cards though..... <_< [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_dry.png]

 

Its like $7.00 a pack without shipping so that's like 40 cents a card since there is only like 20 encounter cards.  Talk about robbery....

 

Anyhow, can't wait to hear about them!!

I'm hoping it comes soon. I've had Season 3 on special order at my local game store since it was first announced here on FFG, early September.

Nice! Thanks for sharing, Raven! Hills of Emyn Muil is up there with my favourite quests, but it's nice to see the twists they've given this one for nightmare mode. Just another year or so before the pack actually makes general release, then...

Is the 3rd set of nightmare decks going to be Khazard Dum?

Not confirmed yet, but it seems logical that this will be the case.

 

Also, I will have the Nightmare previews for The Dead Marshes and Return to Mirkwood up soon.
