Are they going to release Hiers Of Numenor befors the 2nd Saga expansion?  If so that seems kind of silly…let me know,  thx in advance.

 From what I have observed, it looks like "Heirs of Numenor" actually does come out before the new Hobbit set. I think that's kinda strange, but I am fine with it whether "Heirs" comes out before the new Hobbit set or not.

hobbit II will be out next year i guess

i think its because hobbit packs are saga so not related to other packs

Hmm.. I'm kind of sad, but that's probably because I'm spoiled by FFG. :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]
