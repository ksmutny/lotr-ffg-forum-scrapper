Ok so I'm playing Nightmare Peril in Pelargir for the first time and have gotten to a point where the only two cards in staging are Dockside Street and Lossarch Bandit. The Bandit has Ranger spikes attached to it (it was returned to staging due to the treachery card that returns brigand enemies to staging) and also has Alcarnons scroll attached as last round it was attached to an enemy (due to a shadow effect) and was attached to the enemy with the highest defense at the end of the combat phase due to the new nightmare effect that attaches the scroll the to the enemy with the highest defense in play. The effect from the Dockside street stops me from doing damage to the enemy while in staging or optionally engaging it... at the same time ranger spikes stops it from engaging me...... I therefore cannot engage or damage by any means I can see (sneak attack gandalf or haldirs ability will not work, both of which I can use) and cannot engage it either, as well as this you can only travel to dockside street by exhausting the hero with alcarnons scroll attached which I cannot do so within two more turns the enemy will have 3 resources and "escape" with the scroll and I will lose.
I cannot see any way around this or way to stop this unless a shadow card makes me discard an attachment and I'm not even sure if this quest has any shadow effects of that nature. Alternatively Asfaloth or some other effect to remove the location could help but even if I draw Asfaloth next turn I will not have enough to explore the location.

Seems I completely screwed myself here.... time to start over...

Thought I would share this interesting and horrible situation I managed to put myself in.. :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

hah, that's a real snafu... sounds like a 'nightmare.'
