Am having a little trouble getting it all straight for the first turn -- after I deal 3 guards to the objectives, I realize I can optionally engage enemies later in the round, during the combat phase.  But if their threat level is lower than mine (Dol Guldur Orcs for example are a threat of 10), do they automatically leave the staging area and engage me just like a normal enemy (thats not gaurding anything?  Likewise, can I simply travel to a location-guard if that is what comes up?  I think if a treachery card comes up as a guard, it gets resolved and then leaves the objective unguarded.  Just need to make sure I'm playing these correctly....

The enemies and locations that get Objectives attached to them behave the same as any other enemy or location. Having the objective attached does nothing to them.

And the objectives remain attached to them until they leave play (by being destroyed or explored respectively). You are correct that if the guard is a treachery it simply resolves and leaves the objective unguarded.

Thanks -- with this clarification, I am now proceeding to get pounded by this Quest repeatedly.  I am beginning to see why everyone says it can not be beaten with the CORE set!

Not true. It can't be beaten alone with the Core set. I did it with another player, though it took a good part of the week between Christmas and New Year's

You have to be extremely lucky in you encounter cards draw, and the first 2-3- turns are crucial if you want to win.

Correction - it can't be beaten alone, consistently, with the Core Set (and odds aren't great if you're new to the game as well). I've beaten Dol Guldur solo with just the Core Set, but multiplying my attempts up by 3 to account for the fact I was picking my captive rather than randomising, it's probably less than a 1% win record.

That's still quite amazing.

I modified the quest to make it playable:

 

   When picking a prisoner, randomly choose a hero from the box (without looking at it) instead of picking one of your 3 heroes.

   During setup, only reveal cards equal to the number of players in the game. Attach objectives to the cards you revealed; set any extra objectives out of play.

   Out of play objectives will attach to the next enemy or location revealed from the encounter deck.

I could certainly agree to adding fewer objectives to the staging area and therefore revealing fewer cards to guard them. Maybe add a new objective when one gets claimed.

I always choose the hero to be the captive (I play solo in nightmare mode and I've only won once), because if you don't, the quest becomes unplayable.

It's a lot easier now the card pool has expanded.

 

I've beaten it with a two-hero deck (and no small amount of luck).

The nightmare version is crazy, it one of the most difficult quests of the game, the hardest probably being Return to Mirkwood nightmare in pure solo.
