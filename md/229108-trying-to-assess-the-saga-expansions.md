Been playing the game for about a year now and have not yet touched the saga expansions.  My playgroup consists of Me, my GF and another couple.  Was hoping you guys could answer some questions for me...

 

What's the optimal number of players for any given quest?  Is four too many?  Should I just be playing them with my GF?

 

Are they deck building "requirements"?  I know playing the "On the Doorstep" with four Rohan decks isn't very thematic but can it be done?

 

Anything else a Saga newbie should know going in?

1) The optimal number is whatever is fun for you and your group.

 

2) There aren't any deckbuilding requirements that I'm aware of other than excluding Bilbo (for the two Hobbit Sagas), Frodo (Black Riders, Road Darkens, Land of Shadow, Mountain of Fire), and Aragorn (Treason of Saruman, Flame of the West).

Kakita answered everything but this one.  Do them in order.  :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

I figured he knew that already.

And in the quests in Treason of Saruman, you cant use Saruman or Grima. Edited September 2, 2016 by CaffeineAddict

But in the quests in the following box (Land of Shadows) you can use them. Which is great! :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]
