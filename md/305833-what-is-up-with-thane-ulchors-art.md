# [What is up with Thane Ulchor&#039;s art?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/305833-what-is-up-with-thane-ulchors-art/)

Just played Temple of Doom and I cannot get over Ulchor's look. He's rocking a denim jumpsuit, one massive pauldron with leather straps, and a thin headband. He has maggoty sallow skin, greasy hair, and a goatee. It is truly one of the strangest art choices I've seen in the entire life of the game. The art of the treachery "Ulchor's Rage" really shows his ensemble in all of its glory. 

Is this a reference to something I'm completely missing? Is he a strange Mad Max ripoff? What is going on with Ulchor? 

 

EDIT: Oh... it's him. I retract my questions, but still think that is without a doubt the worst get-up in the game.

What I want to know more about is that crackling sword!

I dont mind his art at all. If your looking for the worst "get up"/art in the game, check out ally Nori.
