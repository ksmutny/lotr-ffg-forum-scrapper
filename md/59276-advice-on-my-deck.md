heres a dwarf silvan deck im playing with....

the general theme is card draw and protector of lorien to buff up willpower, and fast hitching the hobbits with burning brand and erebor boots attatched so that they can defend multiple times and stop those add goblin to staging area shadow effects

the secondary theme is support from mirkwood runners to one shot 2-health goblins

the runners are kept in play by silvan trackers healing them and other silvan characters such as riversong, haldir etc

lastly im playing about with zigil miner and map maker and trying to keep most cards 2/3 costs to give more chance of success but this is more of a fun based thing

the problem is getting consistency with this deck, it relies heavily on the first draw and getting POL early on. also the only allies that can really help clear the path are the runners, the rest are more support

anyways im really digging silvan at the moment, never really paid them much attention hence the creation of this deck. let me know your thoughts

oh yeah i have all cards to date and 1 core set

 you might consider trading out frodo for dwalin.  also, possibly ditch bifur for dain.  then add sneak attack and longbeard orc slayer, celbrians stone, steward of gondor.  at the least i would consider dain and the longbeard orc slayer.

ive thought about doing this but i really dont like going above 2 spheres...even with songs in...im trying to keep lore/spirit as much as i can, i think to add leadership id have to drastically change the entire deck

Why not trade in the 3rd Strider's Path and remove an Ancestral Knowledge? I find the Path to be most useful when playing solo as a way to bypass the Necromancer's Pass, Gladden Fields and Mountains of Mirkwood. Obviously, if you're playing mostly Khazad-Dûm, then Ancestral Knowledge becomes better.

You should really consider switching Bifur. Denethor would give you a second shot at peeking at the Encounter Deck (having a single core limits you seriously as you only have one Hemanarth Riversong) and he's better than Hobbits at defending while still being eligible to A Burning Brand. If you do that, you can also remove one of the Boots from Erebor. You could replace it with any of Lore of Imladris, Self Preservation or Daughter of the Nimrodel. This would also increase your 2-3 ratio for the Miners.
