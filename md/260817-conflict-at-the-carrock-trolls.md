Hi people,

Two questions about Response: After defeating Stuart, you may choose and discard 1 "Sacked!" card from play.

1. Could I search in the discard and encounter decks for 1 Sacked! card? or does the text refer to Sacked! cards in play?

2. Is the discarded card put out of play or in the discard pile?

Regards,

Cards in the encounter deck or discard pile are not in play, and the card is put in the discard pile (when a card is put out of play, it is normally phrased like ''put the x card out of play''). ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]
