Eriador Wastes

Travel: The first player engages a Warg enemy in the staging area and deals it a shadow card.

 

Slopes of Amon Hen

Travel: A player at this staging area must engage an enemy in any staging area to travel here.

 

 

Am I correct in guessing that the difference between these two cards is that for Eriador Wastes you get a free pass if there happens to not be any Wargs in the staging area?

Every time I've asked Caleb about these kinds of things, he explains that travel costs have to be paid before you can travel to a location. So neither of these can be traveled to if there isn't an enemy to engage. 

 

For example, I asked about Entwood, which is worded in basically the same way.

 

Hello. When Travel effects on cards like "Entwood" from the new Voice of Isengard nightmare pack have you "engage the highest engagement cost Huorn enemy in the staging area," can you still travel there if there are none in the staging area, since the highest was 0, or do you have to engage a huorn to pay the "cost" to travel there? Thanks.

 

Hi Chris,
If there are no Huorn enemies in play, then you cannot travel to Entwood because you cannot pay its travel cost.

 

Hope that helps.

Ok I was confused because costs in this game are normally structured with the word "to".
