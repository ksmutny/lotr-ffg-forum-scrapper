I just have a quick question. If i am using the tracker and placing progress on locations in the staging area. If i meet the requirement. do I still need to travel and then complete the next quest cycle to discard that loc, or does it discard from the staging area?

It gets explored and discarded from the staging area, you don't need to travel there.
