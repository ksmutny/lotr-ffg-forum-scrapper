By now everyone has seen the new cool LOTR sleeves put out by FFG and I was thinking about sleeving my encounter cards with the eye sleeves but I noticed that these are limited.

So my concern is do you think that FFG will use core encounter sets for any future AP? If so then it would not be worth it having to hunt down sleeves everytime another AP comes out. I know I could just use clear cases but it would be nice to keep the encounter sets somewhat seperated.

To be honest I just sleeve the actual quest cards themselves. I don't bother with the encounter decks. This may change but it's what I do at the moment. Other than that the only other cards I sleeve are the heroes. Basically the cards that are guaranteed  to be out on the table to some time.

I'm a sleever, so I've sleeved all the cards. Encounter cards would be top-2 in priority in any case, along with player cards as they get shuffled the most and also because putting in new cards, you could spot to new cards from the old. By the time you've played the Core + 1-5 of the Mirkwood cycle, I'm guessing you could easily tell when a card fro Return to Mirkwood is on top due to wear.

Spirit, did you mean player cards instead of heroes? IMO heroes are the least important cards ever to sleeve, there barely any randomizing of them needed so they are never shuffled, so no wear.

 My top sleeving priority was Hero cards. (Don't want to worry about them getting shuffled in with the player cards.)

Encounter cards require lots of shuffling (and I had some black-backed sleeves given to me) so they're sleeved too.

Other cards are not sleeved at this time. Art sleeves look nice, but I can't justify the expense.

No I meant the hero cards as they are the ones that are ALWAYS put down on the table. I want to avoid them picking up anything from the table or from my hands as they are handled. At some point I might get to sleeving the rest though I've never felt it necessary before.

See, I don't see any point in why this would matter. You almost never randomize them, so if they aren't exactly mark-free, it matters so rarely, it's really not even an issue. Whereas player and encounter cards are in constant use and any markings on them are really bad. Quest and hero cards are the least important in terms of protecting (except those quests that have multiple of a certain stage that need to be randomized). Hero card is always put down on the table, but it just sit there. Player and encounter cards get shuffled, played, discarded, a lot more movement in them.

 I love me pristine cards with little wear...and the art on the card is pretty slick, so I sleeve everything :-)

I have been using the FFG Eye of Sauron for encounter, FFG The one Ring for Characters etc., FFG clear for quest cards.  I have been stocking up to carrry me for awhile.  Once the limited stuff stops, I will go to clear for everything.

 I sleeve all of the player cards, and leave the quest cards and encounter decks unsleeved. I want to sleeve everything, but it can get expensive when you are into multiple card games...
