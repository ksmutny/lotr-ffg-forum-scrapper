# [Which expansion set to buy next.....](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/236374-which-expansion-set-to-buy-next/)

Just to put it out there I have already read the buying guide posted elsewhere.

 

I started playing a few months ago and have all of the first two cycles. I play exclusively single player (may try two handed on some harder quests).

 

I'll be starting Dwarrowdelf soon but want to plan my next purchases ahead of time. Really prefer to buy the whole cycle at once so I can play the quests in order and gradually add cards to my decks.

 

I am on Journey to Rhosgobel, on my fourth failure but came within one of healing the eagle last try (funny I had an easy time of the Carrock, and beat it more than once).

 

Can I skip ahead to Dream Chaser or Sands of Harad (I don't mind buying this one not all at once) and expect to be able to succeed with my available card pool? I was planning on skipping Against the Shadow at least for a cycle (or Hobbit saga....if it were more easily available) anyways.

 

Thanks for any help.

Dwarrowdelf has a slew of powerful cards; you are not going to be doomed facing modern quests. Maybe pick up a few saga boxes, they are definitely most bang for your buck in terms of fun quests and power player cards.

Dreamchaser Cycle is probably beatable even without the full card pool. I can't comment on the Haradrim Cycle yet, however.

For what it is worth, when I visited the US last summer, I had left all my cards at home but wanted to introduce someone to the game so I bought the core-set, the land of shadows, and the Grey havens (two boxes I was still missing, and I was happy buying a second core). We played with two decks and we nearly beat the ruins of Belegost (maybe it was an illusion but I def had the feeling we managed to give the quest a serious go). So I actually felt, you could build fair decks with just these few boxes.

I found the Ring-Maker Cycle to be a lot of fun. If you think you might enjoy running a Silvan deck, that cycle pretty well establishes them.

they said they have the first two cycles.

as far as story goes, you can skip cycles (and even some packs within earlier cycles without losing too much)

Dreamchaser is still probably my favourite cycle so far, and Angmar Awakened was pretty fun before that. i also think now is as good a time as any to jump into Harad, right as it's starting, even if you don't have all the player cards yet. it looks like a really fun cycle.

That's what I was saying... If you have Dwarrowdelf you are good to go against pretty much anything.

You should be fine. The player cards in The Sands of Harad actually compliment the first cycle pretty well; they're toolboxy and cover a lot of ground that could be helpful with a smaller card pool.

Thanks for the input. Good to hear that the newest releases won't be insurmountable with what I have. I'll probably just get into the newest stuff then and buy the older releases as they get reprints easily available.

 

Really wish I had known of this game a long time ago. Card games really hit a dead end for me being two player death match most of the time.

Yeah, it's the one that my wife will gladly play with me.

I play pure solo; after Dwarrowdelf I went through the Hobbit Saga pretty well, and then the LotR Saga through the End of Two Towers (though with some difficulty at the end).

My next foray is into Angmar Awakened; I'm currently getting my rear handed to me by The Lost Realm trying to play a Dunedain deck. I suppose I could do that better with a dwarf deck, but it wouldn't fit the theme.

I've started playing Arkham Horror LCG which is more solo-friendly so far, but then I only have four scenarios.
