"When Revealed:  Starting with the last player, each player must either return a Nazgûl  enemy engaged with him to the staging area or make a Hide 2 test."

 

Can we just choose to return a Nazgûl enemy, even if not engaged with one, and just ignore the ones in the staging area?

Or is it implied that we must make a Hide 2 test if not already engaged with a Nazgûl?

 

If the latter is the case I really wish they would have worded it like "each player must return a Nazgûl enemy to the staging area. If not engaged with a Nazgûl the player must instead make a Hide 2 test"

Since it says "return a Nazgûl  enemy engaged with him," it looks like you can only choose a Nazgul engaged with you.  And if you can't choose that, you'll have to make a Hide test.

Hmm can see how this can be misinterpreted.

I wasn´t trying to imply that a player can return a Nazgûl engaged with another player but rather that you choose to return a Nazgûl from your engagement, which will then fail if no Nazgûl are engaged with you.

Is it a valid way to avoid making a hide test to choose an option that does nothing or do you have to fulfill the hide in that case?

 

> And if you can't choose that, you'll have to make a Hide test.

Which is what I am thinking to be the most logical as well.

However is there an official reference or is it community consensus?

Oh, I see.  So, if no Nazgul are engaged with you, you could choose a non-entity and then nothing will happen.

 

I haven't seen this question discussed before so I can't speak to community consensus or official response.  I would say you can't choose the first option if you don't have any Nazgul engaged with you.  I can't think of another situation where you are allowed to choose something that isn't there (or, rather, choose a "null" option).

I agree. There are several cards that are worded somewhat poorly and this is one of them. The "spirit" of the card surely means you have to meet the conditions of the first option, ie. be engaged with a Nazgul, to choose option one, and if you aren't engaged with a Nazgul you must choose option 2.

Got an answer from Caleb:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You cannot choose an option that you cannot fulfill. If you are not engaged with a Nazgul, then you must make a Hide test.
Hope you're enjoying The Black Riders!
Cheers,

Happy to have it clarified
