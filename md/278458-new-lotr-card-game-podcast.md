I have a new Podcast for the game.  I know there are other great podcasts for the game, I hope this offers something different, as I focus on the encounter cards entirely.  I know others have done great work in blogs on this subject matter, but hopefully this will scratch the itch of anyone wanting this kind of content that they can listen to on their commute, while driving, ect.
 
The first episode covers Intruders in Chetwood, the second The Siege of Cair Andros, and the third my top ten thematic treacheries.  I'll have 3 more up tomorrow.  Soon I will have a webpage to keep all the links straight.  Thanks for reading, have fun QUESTING!
