# [Black Riders Expansion Release Date](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89964-black-riders-expansion-release-date/)

I just saw on Amazon.com a release date for Black Riders: September 27th.   That is much later than I wanted to wait for hobbit goodness.  Oh well, maybe Blood of Gondor will release sooner and that will tide me over for a bit.  Waiting for each expansion/quest pack is the worst!

Sounds to me like you should drop everything and move your whole clan to indy so you won't be disappointed next time :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Sweet, that's not such a long wait. Then later we've got Morgul Vale and Voice of Isengard coming our way :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Agreed, I really wish I could have made it.  I've never been, but maybe one of these days I'll get the chance to go and get early dibs on all the awesome games there.

The Blood of Gondor has been postponed to October?  Why!?

Probably because the release of Black Riders in September. If they released both in Sept. and then Morgul Vale in October, then they would have one month with nothing until Voice of Isengard in December. This way we still get something new each month. However, I don't know why Black Riders is so late in September...should be out sooner!

I no longer baffled by these release schedules nowadays. I was at first surprised because they've already had enough of each to sell at GenCon, which was nearly a month ago, so what's gone wrong? Did they only print a couple of copies of each? But yeah, it'll come when it comes. Having already been without releases for four months in the UK this year, what's another wait?!

Lol I'm broke as it is! Give me some breathing room. Gotta ration my lotr money between diaper and formula purchases.

I'm thinking what Kyrie said up above makes good, financial sense from Fantasy Flight's business perspective.  That is, the idea of them having a release for each remaining month of the year instead of two in September and nothing in either October or November.  

 

Personally, I just want them as soon as possible!

I am nor sure we will actually see Voice of Isengard in December...I have a bad feeling that we will have to wait until next year to actually see this...but maybe I am just being too negative here...

 

Although FFG should be interested in pushing out VOI for Christmas Season :-)

Haha! The Black Riders is off the boat and under the Shipping Now category. 7-10 days till it hits stores. Sometimes sooner if I am not mistaken.

Interesting.  Amazon also changed their released date to Sept. 20th instead of the 27th <http://www.amazon.com/Lord-The-Rings-LCG-Expansion/dp/161661708X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1379112781&sr=8-1&keywords=black+riders [http://www.amazon.com/Lord-The-Rings-LCG-Expansion/dp/161661708X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1379112781&sr=8-1&keywords=black+riders]>

Amazon.co.uk, where i have placed my order, still has unknown day for release

## 22 [Karlson on September 17, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89964-black-riders-expansion-release-date/?do=findComment&comment=867895)

I am fairly confident it is releasing this Friday in the U.S.  

So excited to build me a couple hobbit decks and embark from the Shire!

Ordered mine off amazon. Can't wait to get my hands on those hobbits

## 24 [Nickpes on September 21, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89964-black-riders-expansion-release-date/?do=findComment&comment=871873)

It is officially released ... (Yet not in amazon.co.uk where i ordered, and it pisses me off)
