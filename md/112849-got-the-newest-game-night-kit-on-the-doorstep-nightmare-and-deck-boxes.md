Latest kit just arrived - haven't tried the new nightmare but looks cool. Battle of five armies now has a timer mechanic. Won't spoil too much.

Deck boxes are okay - 4 of them that are all the same.

Sound cool! What about the spider quest? I really like but since is so easy no point to play it...hope in Nmode it is really exiting?

Will try and take pics tonight when I'm home from work.

Each box is the same, looks like hold quite a few cards. Maybe about 100. Will check more whnr I get back.

I have not tried the quests. Also comes with a bars poster and instructions for a tourney included.
