 Hey guys,

 

ever wondered how the alternative version of "Under the Shadow" looks like? Rulebook p  . 7demonio.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/demonio.gif] 

Guess they changed it, because it would have been to powerful? What do you think? By the way, I know of the German Rulebook to have the "correct" version... what about the other languages???
