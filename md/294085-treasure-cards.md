Treasure cards can be used only when playing The Hobbit saga or they can be used in the LOTR saga ? Also they can be used in any scenario if they are earned or restricted to saga scenarios?

You must earn them before ncluding them in following scenarios, and they can only be used in the Hobbit Saga quests. You have Boons and Burdens in the LotR saga instead.

So we cannot mix treasure/boons/burdens cards from The hobbit saga with LOTR saga?

Going by the rules no (also some of those are the same like Mithril Shirt, Sting and Glamdring)

Correct, Boons and Burdens stay in LotR saga, and Treasures stay in the Hobbit saga.
