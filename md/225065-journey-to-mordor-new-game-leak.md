When you click on it it brings you to a broken link though, so I suspect it is an accidental leak like what happened with Conquest.

I got a better shot, but for some reason the pic isn't working.

I can see the article just fine.

 

Game is not new, I saw it being sold in our local webstore long ago, it's just FFG now decided to publish it for some reason.

 

I find the game extremely lame, to be honest. Not worth attention.

Uh uh, it says 404 not found for me. And why did they create the forums for it at 11:32 today? Look at its forums. Evan just created them.

Article worked fine for me right from the start.

"you can look for The Lord of the Rings: Journey to Mordor at your local retailer in the fourth quarter of 2016!"

The theme feels pasted on. It's really strange to think of Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin all racing to try to be the first one to get the ring to Mordor, tripping each other along the way in the hopes that the Nazgul will catch them.

Silly. I give it a pass.

I agree.  I don't have a problem with Munchkin style silliness, but from what I can see on the announcement page, it doesn't look like the game was meant to be particularly silly, so it all comes across as a bit awkward.

Ah man, my first thought was it was going to be a dice version of the old Knizia game, seeing as how FFG has been re-releasing his older games and Knizia is a dice fan.

Uugh, this game seems terrible. You know, besides this game, I can't think of any Lotr game that isn't theme pasted. Even War of the Ring has that godawful combat system from A&A, and is really A&A in middle earth, though at least it is less pasted than this.

So, wait, are there four One Rings now? And why are you trying to beat the Riders to Mordor? How even can you beat the Riders to Mordor, seeing as they're Wraiths and all? And if you're going to go through the trouble of getting through Moria, why would you head south down to Rohan?

A&A in Middle Earth?!  Looks like War of the Ring is getting added to the wishlist...

Not to mention they get to Gondor and then to Minas Tirith.

I don't know why they head over to Helm's Deep, but it'd be kind of hard to avoid going through Rohan, unless you're avoiding the western shore of the Anduin completely until you get to Gondor.

Sure, why not? I have five [http://con.structive.net/rings.jpg] in a bag right here :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

What botters me most is that many games based on Lotr just ignore everything between Bag End and Rivendell. I mean, it certainly didn't have Balrogs, but they had 'peril before and behind them, and on either side' in Gildor's words.

I dont mind games deviating dlightly from the book/film they are based upon as games are replaying the story and even if you simply lose, the story is then different. So its just a theme/environment.

For me, the board/paper seems to have too few spaces on it, too simple.

Also, at first glance this game seems to consist of about 5 dice and a pad of paper. Doesnt seem much...

Looked it up at Amazon, Looks like it is fun if you Play it every year or a half during a flight or something...

 

Main Problem is the theme, there is no Explanation why you don't work as a Team and even try to get other players caught. It just Looks like LotR was slapped on the game to increase the sales...

Yup.

I got really excited every time FFG mentions a new "dice" game. It's never what I expect though. What I really want to see is Dragon Dice, re-imagined as a LotR game. I think that could work quite well.

Dice Masters:LotR, anyone? I'd hoard that like a dragon.

I agree with what's been said, this looks like an unrelated game that they just shoehorned a LOTR theme onto. What a waste of a license.
