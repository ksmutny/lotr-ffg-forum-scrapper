Does committing to an Escape Test count as committing to the Quest during the Quest Phase?

If this is not the case then I will be playing 3 Escort of Edoras during my Dead Marshes adventures. They would be fantastic against Escape tests.

Well I would also say that it doesn't count, but for that reason they wouldn't get their +2 Willpower either.

2 Willpower for two resources is still quite nice, but not quite as powerful as perhaps you might have been thinking...

I play that they provide 2 WP for the escape test, but don't get discarded.  They are not committed to a quest so I don't see the buff or discard coming into effect.

Yeah, I think you're all correct. Committing to an escape test is not the same thing as committing to a quest (see The Dead Marshes rule sheet). So, while participating in an escape test, the Escort will supply 2 willpower but will not be discarded following resolution of the test.

When the Escort was first released, a lot of people wondered why it didn't simply have 4 willpower. Apparently, escape tests and other similar mechanics account for this design decision.
