I just realized that the hero version of Haldir of Lorien can attack into the staging area before enemies makes checks (but after I choose to engage enemies), right?

 

That would make him even more powerful then I had thought, am I correct in this?

No, his ability is a Combat Action meaning it can only be used during the combat phase.  First you have optional engagement, then mandatory engagement checks, then combat.

Still very strong allowing you to attack (and potentially kill) an enemy in staging OR engaged with another player (before it attacks) so long as you do not engage an enemy that turn. Even if you do engage an enemy hes still a powerhouse attacker but things like ranger spikes, plenty of optional engagement by the other deck/s, threat reduction etc can help make his ability usable much more often.

@Teamjimby

Ahh, of course, I forgot that the Engagement phase and the Combat Phase are separated. Then I´ve been playing it right all along.

 

@PsychoRocka

Good point, i wouldn´t have thought of killing off enemies my partner deck is engaged with BEFORE they attack! So, he is more powerful then I thought, just not as much I initially thought.

 

Thank you both!

Haldir is a total beast (but thankfully not overpowered). He may even be supplanting Legolas as my favourite ranged hero.

I use them both and let me tell you, combined they make one hell of a killing machine!

I think Haldir may be supplanting Legolas as my favorite ranged Hero as well but all those times Legolas has saved me and will probably continue to save me by putting progress tokens at a crucial time cannot be forgotten.

Ooh, I wanna try that out! Nice and low threat overall as well, so could work as a secondary deck that snipes enemies off another. I like!

Haldir alone is pretty cool; beginning with Ranger, Silvan, Scout and Ranged traits, 9 starting threat, 3 axe Lore hero that can attack into the staging area... certainly ramps up his awesomeness!

Then you start adding attachments... like Wingfoot so he quests and then readies if any enemies show up - the obvious Rivendell Blades and now the Bow of the Galadhrim... hard not to love this Elf.

 

Legolas innate location progressing ability is hard to beat but Haldir is getting right up there... and i agree with PsyhoRocka... they are great in tandem (whether in the same deck or playing beside you in your buddies deck)

 

edit:  Arguably if you gave him 'Warden of Arnor', then over the course of a game Haldir might actually produce more progress tokens than Legolas.

I have a doubt about Haldir combat ability. Where is written that Haldir is capable of attack to staging area? Because the action only say attack to another enemy if i don't engage any enemy this turn. Other Heroes/allies, like Dunhere, say specifically "atack" or "damage" to staging area, but not Haldir. Gandalf (core) say "in play" to put 4 damage tokens to an enemy. I know that atacking to staging area is player favorable, but that interpretation don't mean that Haldir really is capable of do that, or yes. I don't know for sure. Any official response, please?

No official response is really needed.  Card effects allow you to do exactly what is printed on the card.  Haldir says you may attack an enemy "not engaged with you," and that would include enemies in the staging area as well as enemies engaged with other players (as opposed to Dunhere, whose ability restricts him to the staging area per its text).  Anyway, in solo play, you would not be able to use Haldir's ability if it did not allow you to attack the staging area.

Yep, this one is pretty clear.  Just interpret the text as literally as possible.

But "Ranged" hability also say to attack to another enemy not engage with you.So it's almost the same, isn't it? I don't see the diference.

From the rulebook:

 

>  
> 
> A character with the ranged keyword can be declared by its controller as an attacker against enemies that are engaged with other players.

 

So the key difference here is:

 

Ranged: "against enemies that are engaged with other players"

Haldir: "against an enemy not engaged with you"

 

The former does not include the staging area. The latter does.

Also. Feel free to attack an enemy in the victory display?  :blink: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_blink.png]

And then use Infighting to move the damage from it to an enemy in play? :blink: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_blink.png] The combo?

Is this series of plays actually legal?  I've created a separate post [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/192477-defeating-an-enemy-in-the-victory-display/] to discuss the legality of it.
