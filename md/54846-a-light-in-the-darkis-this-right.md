 So if i get the Troll in the engagement phase can i play Light of the Dark to put him back into staging until next engagement without him attacking in combat phase?

Correct. This card gets dogged by alot of people but it does have its uses for certain quests.

I see this useful when I play with Dúnhere, I find it an obvious combo with him, you do not get to block the enemy and then hit it harder than you would have.
