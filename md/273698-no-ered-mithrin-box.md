# [No Ered Mithrin Box?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/273698-no-ered-mithrin-box/)

I noticed the preview for Withered Heath but haven't seen any information on an Ered Mithrin box.  Each cycle has started with a larger box with 3 scenarios and 2 heroes and maybe 30 hero cards. Are we getting one for Ered Mithrin? Maybe I just missed it...

The deluxe expansion is called Wilds of Rhovanion [https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2017/12/8/the-wilds-of-rhovanion/]. The name of the deluxe box is different than the name of the cycle.
