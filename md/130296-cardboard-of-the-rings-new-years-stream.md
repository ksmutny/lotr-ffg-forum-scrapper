Hey guys!

 

I want to cordially invite everyone to the Cardboard of the Rings' special twitch stream this New Year's Eve, where we will be ringing in the New Year with the only Ring that matters, starting at 10:30 PM ET.

 

I won't promise you flawless technical plays, but I will promise a great time with an always animated and hilarious chat room (really, we have the best viewers). Don't pretend like you have better plans, bring your drinks and stop on by!

See you there!
