# [The juicebox LOTR LCG Solo Player Tournament (#10) [February 12-18, 2012] [COMPLETED]](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60360-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-solo-player-tournament-10-february-12-18-2012-completed/)

## 1 [juicebox on February 12, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60360-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-solo-player-tournament-10-february-12-18-2012-completed/?do=findComment&comment=593219)

Welcome & Introduction:

Welcome to my tenth Solo Player LOTR LCG Tournament. The idea behind this tournament is that for one week (Sunday – Saturday), everyone is invited to participate in playing a particular scenario with particular deck building requirements in a Solo Player Tournament. You are then invited to record and post your final results, the heroes you used, and any additional narrative that you’d like to add.

Note: The tournament has a one-week lifespan, and only games played and recorded throughout this week are valid. As the week unfolds, I will keep this first post updated with the Top Ten results. (Each participant can occupy a maximum of one Top Ten spot at a time, so you’re welcome to try and best your own result throughout the week.) See also, The juicebox LOTR LCG Top Ten Hall of Fame [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=582954].

Will you place in the Top Ten for the week? I hope you’ll participate and find out!

After the end of this week’s tournament, you are welcome to continue to post results to this thread if you continue to play this particular scenario under these particular parameters. However, the Top Ten on this first post will not continue to be updated after the week is over, thus preserving (like a time capsule) the results from this week’s tournament. In the mean time, if you have ideas for a future tournament, feel free to post them in the Ideas Thread [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=579104].

And now… on to this week’s Solo Player Tournament!

Solo Player Tournament #10:

Scenario: Into the Pit
Deck Parameters: Open Build
Tournament Mechanics: Sets of 3*
Number of Players: Solo Player

*Sets of 3:
1) A valid result in this tournament consists of reporting your results (wins and losses) from 3 back-to-back games, using the same deck for each of those 3 games. (Please observe the mulligan rule, and all other rules, from the LOTR LCG rulebook and subsequent official FAQ documents.)
2) After you post your results, the results from your 3 games will be calibrated using the RGun formula** to obtain your Weighted Result.
3) Weighted Results will then be ranked against other player’s Weighted Results in the Top Ten for this week’s tournament.
4) You may play and report as many games (in Sets of 3) as you would like (so you can try out different deck builds over the week).

**The RGun formula has been designed to value both Final Score (per game) and overall Win Ratio (from your 3 games, cumulative). The formula is: (Average Score of Games Won) x (Total Games Played/Games Won). For an expanded discussion on how this formula was created, you can read the thread called Measuring Success.

Top Ten:

1. SiCK_Boy ~ 91 (Éowyn, Théodred, Beravor)
2. leptokurt ~ 104 (Dwalin, Dáin, Bifur)
3. muemakan ~ 105.33 (Boromir, Théodred, Éowyn)
4. Chac ~ 113.66 (Éowyn, Théodred, Legolas)
5. Zjb12 ~ 144.75 (Éowyn, Théodred, Legolas)
6.

My first cycle was a bit disappointing. One loss because I got 2x Watchful Eyes in rounds 1 and 3, and one bad result because I got 2 Goblin Pursuers after using the Cave Torch twice (round 2). The Pursuers got company when a Goblin Swordsman joined them as a shadow effect. To clear the floor from these enemies took me quite a while. My threat was also rising close to 50  as I drew one threat heavy location after the other.

 

Game 1: WIN (120)

Threat: 44

Damage: 0

Fallen:0

Rounds: 80

Victory Points: 4

 

Game 2: LOSS

 

Game 3: WIN (192)

Threat: 44

Damage: 2

Fallen:0

Rounds: 150

Victory Points: 4

 

As always I used 1 core set and all APs + KD expansion.

 This scenario is driving me nuts---half the time I lose, and the other times I have to call the game because there is so much going on with all the encounter location card effects, that I forget and screw something up---ugh!  Last night I literally got stuck on the bridge for several rounds until I eventually threated out, while accumulating tons of resources and cards, none of which I could use since you cannot play cards.

> This scenario is driving me nuts---half the time I lose, and the other times I have to call the game because there is so much going on with all the encounter location card effects, that I forget and screw something up---ugh! Last night I literally got stuck on the bridge for several rounds until I eventually threated out, while accumulating tons of resources and cards, none of which I could use since you cannot play cards.

Almost the same happened to me in my last game. I only needed one more progress on the bridge but kept drawing "Burning Low" with 2 Branching Paths in the staging area. Of course while I was making my way over the bridge I drew all those cards I needed. Once I was over the bridge I encountered two Patrol Leaders before finally the Mapmaker showed me an unprotected shortcut on my way up.

 

I had 6 losses in a row after my last cycle, then 2 wins and 1 loss, and finally I got 3 wins in a row:

 

Game 1: WIN (110)

Threat: 34

Damage: 0

Fallen: 0

Rounds: 80

Victory Points: 4

 

Game 2: WIN (101)

Threat: 34

Damage: 4

Fallen: 0

Rounds: 70

Victory Points: 7

 

Game 3: WIN (178)

Threat: 45

Damage: 0

Fallen: 0

Rounds: 140

Victory Points: 7

 

 

The second game could have been way better if

1) my first attempt to defat the Patrol Leader had not been thwarted (which is why I had to use Gandalf`s ability to accomplish that next round)

and

2) I hadn't drawn 4x Signs of Conflict

So far only my normal deck had a chance against it. But I would rather like to get another deck to work.

Well, there´s still half a week.....

 Well, at least here's something:  game 1, threat 36; damage 6; rounds 6; vps 4.  Total: 98.  Interesting thing here was all 3 Heros, eowyn, theodred, and legolas had watchful eyes on them by the end.  What a pain!  UC helped on legolas And letting round take the fall one turn helped with the others for one round.

Game 2: L.

Game 3: hmm....stuck on the bridge with two patrol leaders and tons of cards and resources in my hand...what do you think happened???   LLLLLLLLL.

Could you try a Ziggy deck if that's possible? I still haven't seen one in action, and I'm not able to build one with only one copy of the core set.

 

However, if you want to have some fun, try out a dwarven deck. That way you can include most of the hew KD cards!

Make sure to bring some Miner of the Iron Hills along with you to remove those nasty Watchful Eye condition attachments in this scenario.  Very helpful to get rid of those and slow the encounter deck draw.

Yeah, tried a dwarf deck in all two player games I played last week. We won every game we played. In my solo games,  I am not there yet.

Hm don´t know if I want to try the Ziggy.......but on the other hand I have got some time this night.

 

By the way, here is my first entry.

 

Heroes: Boromir, Eowyn and Dwalin

1.Game: R-9, TH-36, W-2, V-4= 124

2.Game: R-8, TH-45, W-3, V-4= 124

3.Game: LOST

hm, that makes 186, not that great.

Forgot to put PoL into my deck. Most important card in the Ziggy deck once you got your deck running. Managed a 66 with it. 

First miner hit the table in round 3.

Decided to give it a go with a massive draw deck featuring Eowyn, Theodred and Beravor (made from 3 Core Sets + all expansions).

Results:

Game # 1 - Win: 18 threat + 0 dead hero + 2 wounds - 4 victory points + (7 rounds * 10) = 86

Game # 2 - Win: 8 threat + 0 dead hero + 0 wound - 4 victory points + (8 rounds * 10) = 84

Game # 3 - Win: 7 threat + 0 dead hero + 0 wound - 4 victory points + (10 rounds * 10) = 103

Here's my decklist:

Hero (3)
Beravor (Core) x1

A Test of Will (Core) x3
The Galadhrim's Greeting (Core) x3
Sneak Attack (Core) x3

Comments on the quest:

Having played it a lot a few weeks ago for one of Zjb's tournaments, I was already familiar with the tricks of this quest. You want to be careful with the Torch, although it's almost always worth using it if it's to "clear" a location (you have a few locations with 4 or 5 threat, while most enemies are no more than 3 points of threat value, so if you can handle the fights, the trade-off is great. Having a way to peak at the encounter deck is key as it lets you maximize usage of the Torch and not waste attacks on Patrol Leader. You want to quest with an extra buddie whenever possible because of Sudden Pitfall. The other two dangerous treacheries are Crumbling Ruin and Dark and Dreadful, but even if you don't have a way to cancel them, they aren't game killers. Watchul Eyes can also become cumbersome when it starts accumulating so a work-around is needed. The last aspect is that you want to beware of shadow cards because of the ones that put additional enemies in the staging area.

Comments on my deck:

With all that in mind, I made a few specific choices for this quest. The core of my deck is basic 3 colors cards. The main plan is to get an early Steward (on Beravor, who also gets the Songs), a Protector of Lorien on Eowyn and massive draw from Beravor and Unexpected Courage. Sneaky Gandalf plays a role either as a sharpshooter (especialy in stage 2 of the quest, it's often worth killing the Patrol with Gandalf rather than reducing your threat as you can skip to stage 3 as soon as your clear the board of enemies). Henamarth is also a key component of the deck in general (allows to pace the questing and plan around treacheries), but even better against this specific quest because of all the interactions. I had originaly considered playing Dunhere instead of Theodred to attack the enemies in staging during the first part of the quest as well as using Denethor instead of Beravor. I'm sure such a setup would have been as consistent (in win %), but much more slower (hence giving worse scores). Also, it would have required an early Song of Kings as well as a Steward to start the engine while the current version is up and running on turn 2 with just a Steward.

I'll remove the 2 Song of Wisdom the next time I play it. The original intent was to be able to play all my A Burning Branch, but the truth is that I simply block multiple times with Beravor (from his Unexpected Courage) when required. So the 2 Songs would change for either Stand and Fight (allows you to discard to Eowyn early and get these allies back later) or Dwarven Tomb (to pick up A Test of Will). I'm also not 100 % sold to the Dunedain Mark. They give some fighting power (played on Beravor), but maybe an ally with fighting power would give the same results.

As for specific choices against this scenario, the 3 Miners of the Iron Hills could swap out against a scenario without dangerous conditions. Snowbourn Scouts were added as questing fodder in case of A Sudden Pitfall. They could also take a break if required. Possible replacements include: the 3rd Gleowine, the 3rd Rivendell Minstrel, West-Road Traveller or Strider's Path (fullfil similar functions), Escort from Edoras, The Riddermark's Finest, Erebor Hammersmith, Haldir, Eomund, Elfhelm and Gildor Inglorion. I'd probably steer clear of the high-cost allies because I rarely stock on resources over turns (and with the card drawing, it's easy to have playable cards each turn).

Comments on my games:

Not much to say. They all went pretty much according to plan. The last game was the longest one; I was engaged early by a Goblin Follower and had to keep defending, thus slowing my card draw. I also had 2 Goblin Scout in the staging area for a while. Once I found my second Unexpected Courage, a combination of Gandalf and The Galadhrim's Greetings finally allowed me to engage these villains and clear the staging (at one point, I thought I'd take the reverse road as my threat was up to 34, but I didn't have to).

Ok, I know we all know my draw deck by now. 

Beravor, Theodred and Eowyn.

Game1: Rounds: 8, Threat: 0, Wounds: 0, Victory: 4........76

Game2: Rounds: 7, Threat: 0, Wounds: 0, Victory: 4........66

Game3: Rounds: 6, Threat: 0, Wounds: 0, Victory: 4........56  

Total Score: 66

 

I guess I won´t be able to play this weekend so I want to get a better result on the board. Had already played the 3 games on monday.

I´ll try another deck again this night. If I score a good result with that one, I´ll probably take the result as my entry for the week.

 Yeah, had time to play.


Boromir, Theodred and Eowyn.


Game1: Rounds: 8, Threat: 37, Wounds: 0, Victory: 7……..110
Game2: Rounds: 10, Threat: 41, Wounds: 3, Victory: 4……..140
Game3: Rounds: 5, Threat: 21, Wounds: 2, Victory: 7……..66
Total: 105,33  


The last game went really great. Got rid of stage1 in round 4. The Patrol leader was killed with a sneak Gandalf.?In Round 5 I had the chance to blaze through in on go......but drew DREADFUL GAP. ?I had 12 Willpower and 9 Characters, so only 3 progress on the quest. Next round saw a Watchful eyes encounter card....WIN

@juicebox: please take this result as my one entry for the tournament and not the 66. Thanks.

First of all my special thanks to muemakan for not using his card drawing machine result. aplauso.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/aplauso.gif]

I still want to send another plead to Juicy to restrict Beravor in his tournaments!

 

Ok, back to business: finally managed to get a cycle that inreased my result:

 

Game 1: WIN (93)

Threat: 33

Damage: 4

Fallen: 0

Rounds: 60

Victory Points: 4

 

Game 2: WIN (103)

Threat: 37

Damage: 0

Fallen: 0

Rounds: 70

Victory Points: 4

 

Game 3: WIN (116)

Threat: 39

Damage: 1

Fallen: 0

Rounds: 80

Victory Points: 4

 

Got really lucky when trying to kill the Patrol Leaders, as I didn't once  draw an enemy when dealing the damage. In game 2 I only had to face one Goblin Scout beside the unavoidable Patrol Leader, that never happened before (usually I have around 4-6 enemies). Got him in round 1 and decided to kill him with Gandalf. I then even had enougb attack power to kill the Patrol Leader immediatly without using Gandalf.

The last game I played tactically, to be honest. I knew how many points I needed to achieve to get below muemakan's result. In round 8 I had 6 progress on 2B and one enemy left (Goblin Scout, sigh). I used Ziggy with a 2 and won the bet, so I could pay the 5 resources needed for Gandalf and killed the Scout. I had 19 WP vs 4 threat (Lightless Passage). Of course I got another Lightless Passage and had to quest another round. At least I could buy Self Preservation (Dáin had Narvi's Belt) to heal 2 damage from Dáin.

 

A question to those who are playing with non-dwarf decks: How do you deal with all those enemies? Is the game as volatile for you as in my games? I mean I had 4 games in a row where I didn't even get to stage 2B, then I have some wins in a row etc.

How do you manage to get this fast through 1B? In fact it only took you 3 rounds as it is almost impossible to make any progress in round 1. Or are you taking the risk to get slaughtered in case you draw an enemy?

## 21 [SiCK_Boy on February 18, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60360-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-solo-player-tournament-10-february-12-18-2012-completed/?do=findComment&comment=595824)

I didn't face as much enemies as you did, I guess. Defending with a hero equiped with A Burning Branch also helps a lot in reducing the number of enemies as it prevents those shadow effects from putting enemies in the staging area. Besides that, a careful usage of the Torch is enough to get through the quest.

I try to tackle the enemies as they come so that they never accumulate too much in the staging area or engaged with me. Gandalf is often used to kill enemies in this scenario rather than reducing threat.

As for Muemakan's results, I must say I'd also like to see some play by play at some point. Not because I doubt his results, but because I use a similar deck and keep winning always in a couple more turns than he did. I often play very "conservative" in my games; keeping backup and plan B instead of going all out on the quest. The explanation could be that simple. Or it could be just luck, but seeing the type of results he keeps posting, I'm sure it has to do with play style more than anything else.

A few questions for Muemakan:

- Do you quest with Beravor or do you systematically keep him for drawing?

- Can you describe a typical turn 1 against this quest?

- Do you choose to systematically travel to locations or leave them in the staging area (especialy when dealing with locations that require more progress than they have in threat value, like the Goblin Tunnels)?

- Do you use Beravor in combat or again systematically use him to draw?

In my case, I often end up using Beravor in combat (both to defend and to attack), meaning (depending on the number of enemies drawn) I don't always maximize my draw, meaning I don't have so much cards to pitch to Protector of Lorien (except on the last stage of the quest, I rarely go with a large dumping of cards). Also, although I do play Snowbourn Scout as fodder, in this scenario (and the other KD scenario as well), I keep them as last resource defenders because of all the dangerous shadow effects. Unless it means putting him in risk of dying, I'll instead choose to defend with Beravor (I can heal him with Daughter and A Burning Branch cancels the shadow).

Nice job this week everybody, tackling the dark of the mines, and seeing your heroes across the infamous bridge.

I'll be updating the Hall of Fame shortly, so check that out. I think this result will see muemakan over the 100 point mark! aplauso.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/aplauso.gif]

As mentioned in the Ideas Thread, I'll be taking a bit of a break before hosting my next Solo Tournament, so keep you eyes open for an announcement in that thread regarding future possibilities. Also, for the sake of implementing a future Living Tournament scene (in the works and waiting for an improved forum option and/or high quality external site option), I appreciate any feedback about your experience playing games in Sets of 3. Initially, there had been some debate that Sets of 4 or 5 would help place an even higher importance on Win-Ratio. Clearly, that's true by the numbers, but player experience is hugely valuable. It seems, from the feedback so far that Sets of 3 is the sweet spot - acceptable balance of factoring in final score, win ratio, and satisfying player experience. If any of you have more specific thoughts about this (in agreement, contrary, etc...) those are most welcome.

Thanks for being champions!

I have Vassals and Snowbourns to help with questing to avoid the treacheries which kills one questing character. I can ready Boromir if if need to. And I have Hasty Stroke to counter those dreadful shadows.

As I remember it went like this: First round 6 progress on the east gate, second round completed east gate and some progress on the quest. 
Round 3 saw the end of First Hall and the completion of 1B. In round 4 the bridge was killed by a nice horse and a scout......

A question to those who are playing with non-dwarf decks: How do you deal with all those enemies? Is the game as volatile for you as in my games? I mean I had 4 games in a row where I didn't even get to stage 2B, then I have some wins in a row etc.



Boromir was working overtime. The Vassals and Scouts went to hell quite often.
If Boromir couldn´t kill enemies in one go, quite often the Gondorian Spearman did the job in the next round.
The possibility to cancel shadows was also quite useful. D. of Thorondor helped against those Scouts.

I'm sure it has to do with play style more than anything else.

A few questions for Muemakan:

- Do you quest with Beravor or do you systematically keep him for drawing?

- Can you describe a typical turn 1 against this quest?

- Do you choose to systematically travel to locations or leave them in the staging area (especialy when dealing with locations that require more progress than they have in threat value, like the Goblin Tunnels)?

- Do you use Beravor in combat or again systematically use him to draw?

In my case, I often end up using Beravor in combat (both to defend and to attack), meaning (depending on the number of enemies drawn) I don't always maximize my draw, meaning I don't have so much cards to pitch to Protector of Lorien (except on the last stage of the quest, I rarely go with a large dumping of cards). Also, although I do play Snowbourn Scout as fodder, in this scenario (and the other KD scenario as well), I keep them as last resource defenders because of all the dangerous shadow effects. Unless it means putting him in risk of dying, I'll instead choose to defend with Beravor (I can heal him with Daughter and A Burning Branch cancels the shadow).



......I use a completely different deck than you use. Apart from UC on Beravor and Gleowine you don´t have card draw in your deck.

- I always draw cards with Beravor. ( there may be exceptions, but they are highly unlikely )

- Turn 1.......well, drew a card and then 2 more with Beravor if I didn´t have the cards I need. If my hand was sufficient I´ll use Beravor at the end.

   To be on the safe side for questing in round one you want a scout in play and "A Test if Will" in your hand. Although sudden pitfall isn´t that likely to come up.

   An early location in the staging would be nice to play "Old Mathom" on it. 

   Questing with Eowyn and Theodred......that´s a 6 willpower if needed.

   This quest was a perfect quest for my deck, actually. You don´t have to worry about enemies as long there is the East Gate in play.

   Most of the time I let the East Gate stay until I have all my cards in hand.

- I didn´t travel to locations most of the time ( see above)

- I always draw cards with Beravor. ( there may be exceptions, but they are highly unlikely )

OMG I am a COMPLETE IDIOT!!!!!!!!

 

I've been playing, what, over 50 games of ItP and I always put East Gate into the staging area instead of making it the acticive location. llorando.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/llorando.gif]

 

But this I swear: Next time I'm gonna read the quest card text carefully and not once, not twice, but at least three times before I'm going to start a new scenario.

 

If some of you game hosts looks for a nice quest modification, you should use this. Pimps ItP from level 5 to 6.

 

 

Thanks for answering and adding those helpful details, muemakan!

We all know the feeling. The first few games I played when KD came out,  I used the cave torch to get rid of every location.
......ignoring the sentence about it being a dark location. Those were very easy wins.....
