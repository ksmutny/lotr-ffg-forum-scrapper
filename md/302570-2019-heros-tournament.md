# [2019 Hero&#039;s Tournament!](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/302570-2019-heros-tournament/)

## 1 [Durins_Father on November 21, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/302570-2019-heros-tournament/?do=findComment&comment=3833994)

This year we from Vision of the Palantir host another tournament style poll to determine the community's favourite hero. With the game nearly at its end until the break is over, nearly all heroes (except 2) are included in this poll to find out who is the most loved by the community in general.Â 

The poll will go through 2 stages, the first is a Swiss style poll where heroes are matched up randomly against each other every 3 days. This gives them 8 battles each where you can vote for your favourite hero. From these matches, 16 heroes move on to the second stage of the poll, where the 16 places are randomly seeded and the heroes have to compete with each other until only 1 hero remains. That hero will be crowned the Community's Favourite Hero as of 2019. This will be announced at midnight on New Year's Eve (GMT+1).Â 

The link to the first 8 rounds of Swiss can be found here:Â https://challonge.com/LOTRLCGHero2019 [https://challonge.com/LOTRLCGHero2019]

Some notes:

- This tournament does not include any Saga hero heroes, meaning that heroes from the Baggins and Fellowship spheres will not be included.

- Some heroes have several versions of themselves. As long as those versions are in different spheres, the hero gets an additional entry. Alt art versions of heroes do not count. This explains why some heroes have their sphere behind their name to identify the different hero cards.Â 

- The bracket will be held in a different poll based on the results of this one. A link to that will follow soon.

- Each hero is unique and has their own place in the game. This is not to determine which heroes are terrible, but which hold the highest in terms of community appreciation.

- If your hero doesn't make the cut, then vote for the next one you like. You are bound to have more than just one hero you like

- If you haven't played with both heroes, you can leave the vote blank.

- In order to vote, you must be signed in on the site, there is no way around this, unfortunately. Signing in will allow you to participate in other future polls like this as well.Â 

- Other comments on different platforms have no influence on the results. Only the pure votes on this site are taken into account when assessing the winners.Â 

Â 

Dates:

Â 

First round until: Midnight November 26th

Second round until: Midnight November 29th

Third round until: Midnight December 2nd

Fourth round until: Midnight December 5th

Fifth round until: Midnight December 8th

Sixth round until: Midnight December 11th

Seventh round until: Midnight December 14th

Eighth round until: Midnight December 17th

Â 

After this, the bracket begins

16->8 until: Midnight December 22nd

8->4 until: Midnight December 26th

4->2 until: Midnight December 29th

2->1 until: Midnight January 1st, 2020

[All dates and times are in GMT+1]


You can follow this thread for updates on the tournament and announcements for the next rounds. I hope this poll will receive as many votes as last year, when we polled the best scenario in the game.Â 

100 heroes go in
1 goes out
This...Â is the Hero's Tournament 2019

Tactic Eowyn will win the tournament!

She has enough willpower to get through each battle. With just a Golden Shield it can defend a hit from every other hero and could then slay most of them (Beorn might be the only one not to).

:)

Love that Imrahil got paired up against himself and some of the outclassed matchups like Gandalf V.S Fatty hahaha. IÂ think the hardest choice was Tactics Legolas versus Leadership Boromir for me.

Â 

Just voted and excited to see who pulls ahead of the rest.

Arwen vs Grimbeorn.

Â 

When 2 of the your most loved heroes clash in turn 1 your heart is broken...

I don't know...for me it's a hero with great starting stats and the ability to get setup super fast. My boy tactics Beregond takes that crown. A first turn Gondorian shield and Spear of the Citadel is bonkers. I tend to lead towards good defense when I play... I rarely find myself killing a lot of enemies.

I like heroes that fundamentally change how the game is played:

-Tactics Legolas for being the only card in the game that can pass the quest during any phase.Â 

-Eleanor for being able to repeatedly ignore 1/3 of the encounter deck (also the worst 1/3).

-Erestor for his insane draw and discard

-Gandalf for playing with your top card face up

Â 

Heroes that almost feel like a different LOTR LCG variant then a single hero in the game are tops for me. But the tribal leaders are excellent for theme as well.

AlsoÂ Tactics Imrahil and Lore Denethor should also be on that list as they too are quite different in their effects on the game.Â

For me too it's one of the best card of the game exactly for that reason, it can really throw a wrench in the encounter deck "strategy" when you advance in the combat phase and avoid some nasty effect that would have showed up during a quest phase (or you can better prepare for the next turn and the new quest stage).

Noticeable lineups this time

Gimli vs himself

I just can't manage to understand the love for Leadership Aragorn. I may notice it can be useful in the core set environment, event if I still prefer Theodred from his sphere. But the more we build the less we use it. He has an ability who does not support any thematic of the game, and who is expansive in comparison of every card we can pay for with resources.Â  I found it to be one of the worst hero to build with now, and the worst Aragorn for sure. In order to compare I do have built some decks with every other heroes of the core set (except for lore Glorfindel). I was already aware of the success of leadership Aragorn but I keep to be perplex when I face the number ðŸ¤”
On this other hand spirit Frodo have a unique ability, many interaction and use (I actually play it in 4 decks I think). He is, with Dain, my favorite Hero from the first cycle.

I have already voted for the second round!

Plot Twist: Everyone that participates in the tournament has to build a deck around the eventual winner with a grey wanderer contract!

I am immensely enjoying seeing everyone's different take on various heroes. In addition to a fun voting poll, this is generating some great discussion. Great idea! Voted in round 1, will vote in round 2 later when I am able.Â 

## 14 [General_Grievous on November 26, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/302570-2019-heros-tournament/?do=findComment&comment=3837138)

I am surprised that Treebeard has more votes then Aragorn from the core set, as much as I love the wooden fellow. Also surprised Caldera is so unloved, she is a blast to play.

How is brand almost gaining on tactics Boromir??!! Also weird for Haldan having such a strong showing against Tactics Legolas. Halbarad v.s. Eleanor, and Hirluin v.s. Elohir are two other ones I'm surprised are as close as they are.

Â 

Finally how is Argalad better than Spirit Legolas? I must be missing something.

## 15 [FirstOrderProblems on November 26, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/302570-2019-heros-tournament/?do=findComment&comment=3837241)

@General_Grievous [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/183728-general_grievous/]Â same. I'm also surprised at how big of a lead Lore Denethor has over Elladan. I guess it's because L Denethor is insane in solo? He's always been a bit underwhelming in big games for me. I think people really undervalue leadership Aragorn's Noble trait and easier time equipping Sword that was Broken - not to mention his inborn yet costly flexibility.

For Spirit Legolas, personally I think that his ability is just too high of a cost. You have to commit a 1 WP character to the quest (forgoing his 3 ranged attack) and discard a card. If I'm gonna discard every turn I'd rather take Arwen, who can pitch to enable fast unexpected courages and who quests for a lot more. I also prefer Lanwyn for a spirit ranged option as she quests better and scales up really nicely in big games where you're more likely to see surges.Â 

On the other hand Argalad gets to wear Ranger Boots really nicely, enabling a 2 WP quest every turn, and if he readies can contribute an additional "2 WP" via his ability or stay ready to contribute ranged later in combat. Every once in a while he pings too which is nice. I think it's just a lot easier for Argalad to unlock more of his stat points with a little work, as he scales up really well with the numerous Lore/elf/character readying effects and uses any attack boosts for good value.

It's important to note that the poll claims this is about *favorite* hero, which isn't necessarily the same thing as "better" and *certainly* isn't the same as "more powerful".Â  I voted for Dori over Saruman not because I think he's a stronger hero, but because I like him more.Â  If we're going to judge by sheer efficiency alone, we might as well not have a tournament and give TaEowyn the prize now.Â  (Disclaimer -- I've also voted for TaEowyn...)

## 17 [Wandalf the Gizzard on November 26, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/302570-2019-heros-tournament/?do=findComment&comment=3837409)

@dalestephenson [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/256741-dalestephenson/] The difference between favorite and better is pretty clear, but do you have separate definitions for "better" and "more powerful" heroes, too?

## 18 [dalestephenson on November 26, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/302570-2019-heros-tournament/?do=findComment&comment=3837495)

Certainly.Â  The necessary follow-on question to "which hero is better" has to be "better at what?"Â  I don't think there'd be any disagreement that Gandalf is a more powerful hero than Theodred.Â  But is he "better"?Â  Certainly not in a utility role, and Theodred fits comfortably into more decks than Gandalf.Â  He's a different kind of hero.

## 19 [Halberto on November 26, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/302570-2019-heros-tournament/?do=findComment&comment=3837564)

All definitions of "better", "stronger", "more powerful ", "more flexible " and so on require necessarily the predefinition of a set of criteria to use for the evaluation.Â  Different people might have different criteria when judging what better or stronger means (solo, multiplayer,Â  better or stronger at what under whichÂ  quest/decks condition.....).Â 

Favorite is very clear: decide who YOU prefer between a given hero choice based on YOUR OWN criteria of choice.Â  It's a good way to get the feeling of the heroes pool the community prefers.Â

And favorites don't depend only on playability, either, but on theme, flavor, and even the artwork of the card! For example, I don't much care for Sp-Theoden almost entirely because I think the art on that card is sub-par. Conversely, I really like the art on Le-Imhrahil (as compared to Ta-Imrahil).

Valid point and I too have been voting for favourite characters of mine. Whether it's their beautiful artwork (Eleanor), power/usefulnessÂ (Eleanor), or just how much I use and enjoy using the heroÂ (Eleanor). Hahaha. ButÂ yes favourite is the key thing here and I am still finding it interesting seeing how much my own thoughts or ratings fare against the average of us all. When showing the list to my wife we even had disagreements over favourite (which usually is linked to which hero is stronger since we use it more but also associates with heroes that are more fun).

Re: Aragorn, I'd echo what Rouxxor said. He was good when the card pool was small and we didn't have other options, but he has long since been outclassed. Personally I much preferred Caldara before the errata, and haven't played her since. I know she's still good, but I no longer find her interesting.

Brand is the lynchpin of the Dale deck, which is still a pretty newly developed archetype along with being interesting and powerful, whereas Boromir is much older, more straightforward, got knocked a bit by the errata (even if he is still really good), etc. Personally I've never understood people's continued love of Tactics Legolas and much prefer Haldan. Halbarad and Eleanor doesn't surprise me that much because I don't think either of them is a hugely popular hero choice. Hirluin does disappoint me, but I guess some people actually like Outlands.

I would ask conversely, how is Spirit Legolas better than Argalad? Because as much as I'm inclined to support Spirit Legolas as something of an underdog hero, there's a lot of reasons why he's an underdog hero, whereas Argalad is a favourite of mine.

Tactic legolas is, how can i say it?, so TACTIC.

Really, I think tactic legolas is so loved for his capability to put quest progress outside questing phase changing the way to interact with the quest itself.Â  Plus easy and natural fit with some of the best weapons in the game. Plus hands upon the bow in sphere too.

Â 

Â Easy to build, low threat,Â  simple ability with huge impact on the game and capability to change the natural flow of the quest.

Bypassing a quest stage or the active location in combact or planning phase ( with hands upon the bow, for example) litterally change the way you play the quest and the way you approach travels in many situations

Â 

Very tactic hero indeed. I admit I loved him

Â

It is difficult to come up with a word to rank all of these heroes by that is easy to understand for everyone in the community. Sure, favorite might be a bit broad or focussing on aspects of a hero that have nothing to do with their strength, but this at least gives some heroes a fighting chance. Otherwise I could have cut the list in half by removing all heroes that rarely see play, and that would have led to some more outrage among the die-hard Dori fans.Â 

So favorite is what I went with, though I predictÂ in the end the stronger heroes will end up in the bracket. But I have found that I tend to start deckbuilding with heroes I like before grabbing the power-heroes, so this was the best way I could spin it.Â 

Happy to announce that we are almost at the 50 votes for round 2, and good to see that the poll is creating some chatter. Anyone have any predictions on the final 16 yet?Â

This is exactly why I also love him and why it remains to this day one of my top picks for a Tactics hero. The fact that I almost always play multiplayer also means that Ranged is quite the powerful tool (even though I find Sentinel still the most precious keyword to have).

I voted for Tactics Legolas, as I think there is a lot to be said for reasonably low threat specialized heroes. Due to his fairly low threat 9, his specialized nature with 3 attack and few wasted stats, his sphere and trait combination granting easy access to excellent weapons, and his ranged keyword, Legolas can slot into a lot of different decks and always pull his weight.Â 

Thurindir is a hero I have been playing with more frequently lately and I have to say that he has become one of my favorites - his ability to start with any side quest is actually pretty amazing... even if Gather Information is the only side quest you include, it makes him a low threat 3 willpower hero and gets you that essential card early, really opening up deck building options. If you include additional side quests, his ability essentially allows you to tech against the scenario. Lots of threat increases? Find Double Back. Lots of minor enemies? Get the tactics quest that reduces non-unique enemies attack by 1. I like him quite a bit more than Gandalf, and am sad he is currently loosing a fairly lopsided vote.

My final 16 prediction is:

Â 

Radagast - new, Eagles are awesome and one of the Istari.

Â 

Beregond (T) - King of defense

Â 

Galadriel - Amazing with her husband or on her own the true white queen.Â 

Â 

Elrond - Vilya aside Elrond can work in any deck and the boost to healing of any type is unmatched.

Â 

Eowyn (T) - move aside Glorfindel there is a new efficient hero on the block.

Â 

Dain (L) - long live the king of the DwarvesÂ 

Â 

Gandalf - Istari, different play style entirely and the most beloved character by many

Â 

Saruman - the new hotness, one of the most requested heroes ever and as Grima has shown it's cool to be bad sometimes

Â 

Aragorn (L) of his three incarnations I believe this one is the strongest for it's amazing effect and it helps being in the best sphere.

Â 

Legolas (T) - only hero in the game that can sneak through quests whenever he wants, always been a game changer

Â 

Arwen - Super efficient and powerfulÂ 

Â 

Sam Gamgee - always trustworthy and strong of heart I believe he'll make it to the final.

Â 

Â 

Â 

I thknk Boromir (T), Hama and Caldera would also be up there if not for silly errata as well.

I definitely prefer "favorite hero" over "best hero" for these types of polls. Favorite leaves so much more room for discussionÂ ofÂ how fun, thematic, and unique a hero might be, rather than just how likely they are to carry you through a quest. When I pick my favorite and least favorite heroes, I don't reallyÂ have a clear and consistent system, but there are some patterns that arise.Â 

My least favorite heroes often have at least one, or a mixture,Â of these features:Â 

 1. Heroes that encourage ally swarm decks: Bombur, Le Boromir, Caldara, Le Dain, Hirluin, Oin, Ori, LeÂ Thorin
 2. Heroes with weak or restrictive abilities: Bombur, Caldara, Dori, Dwalin, Elladan, Elrohir, Lo Glorfindel, Mirlonde, Lo Faramir, Fatty, Na'aasiyah, S Pippin, Rossiel, T Theoden
 3. Heroes that are more suited for single-player:Â Lo Bilbo, Lo Denethor, Grima
 4. Heroes that are overpowered in a passive way: Le Dain, S Glorfindel
 5. Heroes withÂ limited traits: Bard the Bowman, Lo Bilbo, Bombur, Le Dain, Hirluin, Oin, Ori, Dori, Dwalin, Mirlonde, Fatty, Na'aasiyah, S Pippin, Quickbeam, Rossiel, Treebeard

I'm sure you'll notice how totally subjective and inconsistent some of my picks are. I grant you that, but I can explain some of them:

 1. I simply do not enjoy the Dwarf or Gondor ally swarm play-style. Except for a few select quests, I prefer to controlÂ under 10 characters.Â Â I've also always disliked it when I have way more allies than there are enemies in the encounter deck. Defending with one character, then attacking with 10 has never felt right to me. Caldara's spirit ally resurrection play-style is farÂ more dynamicÂ and relies on more powerful allies, but I never liked the mono-spirit restriction or how samey her decks felt after a few games. If you hate Outlands, we agree;Â if you don't, Hirluin is your man! Arguably, Le Brand should be here, and that might be the case once I get tired of Dale ally decks. For the moment, I find arming and readying allies to be more fun than multiplying them.Â 
 2. Weaker heroes can be fun, but not when they're this limited or bland. Bombur is a thematic triumph, but only exists to support an archtype I've grown to dislike. Dori (I'm sorry Durins_Father) could have had one of my favorite hero abilities if the timing of the action was tweaked or if he worked with allies; I truly love what Dori could have been. Dwalin has poor stats and only works in some quests. Elladan and Elrohir are certainly not weak, but they are a resource hungry package deal that limits deck options. Lo Glorfindel is nearlyÂ one of my favorite heroes because of nostalgia, but the only way I enjoy him is when he's being carried by Elrond. Lo Faramir is a hero I want to love but can't; I've run into the wall over and over trying to make him work, and at best he is just fine in certain quests. With all the amazing hobbit heroes, I simply don't have time to bother with Fatty and S Pippin. Na'aasiyah is another hero I want to make work, but IÂ don't enjoy her resource hungry ability. Rossiel isn't incredibly restrictive, but I haven't had the patience for Victory Display shenanigans, and her ability is unreliable in many quests. Caldara, Mirlonde, and T Theoden basically demand mono-sphere decks, which aren'tÂ my favorites.Â 
 3. I nearly always play two player.
 4. I hate Spirit Glorfindel's design, as I'm sure many people do. It remains one of the strangest balance departures in the entire card-pool. And worst of all, the ability (if you can call it that) is really boring.Â 
 5. Poor Bard the Bowman is the only Esgaroth character, lacks the useful Dale trait, and occupies a really awkward thematic position since he'd be dead in any timeline well before most of the quests take place. The weak dwarves, hobbits, and silvans aren't weak due to their single traits, but that limitation certainly doesn't help them. Le Dain should be a noble, Dori should be a warrior, Mirlonde should be a ranger or scout, and Rossiel should be a scout. I included Quickbeam and Treebeard here simply because I'm not fond of Ent decks... not much else I can say there.Â 

My favorite heroes are harder to categorize. Some enable deck types or play-styles that no other hero can match. Some are jack of all trades or fit intoÂ nearly any deck. Some encourage getting multiple uses out of them and playing with low character counts. Some are just cool or thematic enough that I can't help but include them in decks. I tend to think of my favorites by sphere:Â 

LEADERSHIP

 1. Sam Gamgee: His stats kick ***, and building them higher is a blast.Â InnateÂ readying is so much fun, especially when the trigger is engaging an enemy. He is incredible in hobbit decks, but doesn't need to be keptÂ in the Shire. Rangers and Dunedain love him. He comes with a free pony. He's Samwise Gamgee, and heÂ just feels right.
 2. Elfhelm: I love the wayÂ mounts empower heroes, and Elfhelm really gives the archetype a much-needed boost. Part of me wishes he was a Spirit hero, but IÂ still think he'sÂ wonderful as is. He certainly isn't among the most powerful heroes, but IÂ always smile when all six of the heroes onÂ the board are mounted up and riding off on aÂ quest.Â 
 3. Amarthiul: I really dig his combat focused stats and ability. His low health isn't great, but I've found it strangelyÂ fun to work around that weakness. His amazing traits, icon flexibility, and resource gainÂ really boostÂ aggressive decks.Â 
 4. Denethor: I don't use Steward of Gondor, and so I really appreciate heroes that give you an early resource bump. Couple that with low threat, high defense, and resource smoothingÂ and you've got one of the strongest and most versatileÂ backbone heroes in the game.
 5. Celeborn: SolidÂ stats all around, and an ability that greatly enhances the dynamic Silvan archetype. Whereas I tend to dislike wide boards with lots of static allies, I love the guerrilla play style of Silvan decks.Â 


LORE

 1. Aragorn: I love to run with a high starting threat, and bringingÂ Aragorn is one of the best ways to enableÂ that. Even better, he comes with great stats, traits, toys, and sentinel. This will always be my favorite Aragorn, and among my all time favorite heroes.Â 
 2. Erestor: Created an entirely unique deck-type that is a joy to play.Â 
 3. Pippin: Like with Sam, its such a great feeling to be rewarded for engaging an enemy... for being brave. Pippin is probably even more splashable than Sam, and he brings you almost everything you could want from Lore: card draw, enemy management, willpower, hobbit tech, and low threat. The gap between this version and the other is the widest in the entire game.
 4. Haldir: Killing a ravenous warg with a terrible shadow card before it has a chance to strike remains one of my greatest joys in this game. Ranged characters are great in general, but Haldir is a true sniper.Â 
 5. Thurindir: Sidequests have added such a cool new dimension to the game, and Thurindir makes them a reliable part of your deck. Couple that with low threat, efficient stats, and great traits. The only reason I don't put him higher is that side-quests don't work well with many older scenariosÂ and also clash with some of the newer ones.Â 
 6. Honorable mention to Damrod, Folco, Bifur, Haldan, Elrond. These guys might cycle into my favorites list from time to time.Â 

SPIRIT

 1. Cirdan: I believe he's my favorite hero in the entire game, and certainly my favorite spirit hero... which I never would have guessed. Amazing stats and traits. An ability that essentially thins your deck, and with a drawback that's easy to turn into a benefit. I love running unique cards, but hate when they clog up my hand. With Cirdan around, that rarely happens. He fits into many decks, and sings in a Noldor deck. But most importantly, he can use Narya, and unlike Gandalf, Cirdan has no ally version to compete with. His greatest flaw is that he doesn't have a full-art alternate card yet.Â 
 2. Idraen: I feel insane putting Idraen higher than Arwen or Galadriel, but I'm really fond of heroes with innate readying that triggers reliably. I also love her stats, her art, and her general vibe. I don't think she's particularly powerful, but she was in a ton of my favorite decks and beat some of my favorite quests. I'm also biased towards all the FFG original Dunedain heroes because they, like Aragorn,Â fit so well into every scenario.Â 
 3. Arwen: No argument to make here. She's amazing and efficient. Gorgeous art and solidÂ theme.Â 
 4. Galadriel: While I don't love having to rely on Nenya to make Galadriel truly shine, the truth is that she's fine without it. Her ability is just so insanely good that she doesn't even need to have willpowerÂ to justify her inclusion.Â 
 5. Undecided between Dain, Eowyn, Frodo, and Theoden: I really dislike about one half the Spirit heroes, and really like the other half. The sphere contains my favorite and least favorite heroes in the game. Dain is the type of dwarf hero I love, because he incorporates dwarf archetypes without demanding to be in a dwarf deck. Eowyn has been solid forever, but the shine is off her a bit since her Tactics version arrived. Frodo has such a unique and useful ability, and his art is among my all time favorites. Santa Theoden empowersÂ my beloved but oft struggling Rohirrim.Â 

TACTICS

 1. Mablung: As with Sam and Pippin, I really get a kick out of being rewarded for engaging enemies. Mablung isÂ a resource making machine. It's not terribly hard to get 3-4 resources out of his ability per round, but even 1 is great. Well rounded stats and good traits let Mablung fill in as needed. He's useful in anything from mono-tactics to tri-sphere. As long as you find a way to draw cards, Mablung will make sure you can pay for them. If only he was an honorary Dunedain...Â 
 2. Beorn: The bigÂ bear is such an unusual and restrictive hero. Playing with him feels akin to running a contract that buffs one hero immensely, but blanks them. The key to Beorn is figuring out the right tempo to use him. Will you engage everyone you can as early as possible and let them stab at the bear until he's down to one hitpoint? Will you only defend the weakest enemies, and rely on attack reduction and shadow control to keep Beorn in tiptop shape? Even though he is an incredibly restrictive hero in many ways, I've found myself putting Beorn in all sorts of decks. He's risky but exhilarating.Â 
 3. Aragorn: With Mablung at number 1, it's no wonder that Aragorn is along for the ride. I like engaging enemies, and I like doing it duringÂ unusual windows. Add in the defense reduction and you've got a premium killer on your hands. I still prefer Lore Aragorn, but they did such a good job making each version feelÂ unique while still portraying some key aspectÂ of the character.Â 
 4. Legolas: Like Tactics Aragorn'sÂ engagement timing, I love Legolas' ability to clear the active location or advance the quest at unusual times. There really is no hero like him. For such an efficient and reliable killer, Legolas is a deceptivelyÂ weird and dynamic card. And that art is amongÂ myÂ favorite depictions of Legolas.Â 
 5. Undecided between Beregond, Boromir, and Eowyn. Beregond is a tank, Boromir is a machine, and Eowyn is a god. All very powerful and fun, but somehow not higher at this moment. Ask me tomorrow and I'll have changed my mind.Â 


GANDALF

 1. Gandalf:Â Because of everything about him. The only knocks against him are his amazing allies, his hungerÂ for deck space, and that he might be overly strong in some cases.Â

I think it's somewhat correlated, maybe 70%. Too me obviously the weaker heroes don't get played as much because this game is pretty hard and you need right deck-building most times. But also what people value as their favorite could also be connected to their favorite heroes or playstyle. Example I was never much into Radagast and the hobbit movies didn't help but I love Eagles and he makes them amazing. So he jumped onto my favorites list. On that list is Legolas and Boromir because of the books/movies and even if their cards aren't as good (Le Boromir and Sp Legolas) I still like all their hero versions more than the standard power characters. Like not being a Dwarf fan I don't care about any of their characters even though many are quite powerful. So to me power is related to favorite but it's definitely secondary to how much I enjoy the playstyle they are creating or the lore of the character.

There's definitely some correlation for me, but not direct causation. My favourite heroes tend to be based on how fun they are to play and how interesting their abilities are to play with or build around - interesting abilities often enable more options, and with the breadth of the card pool at this point more options often translates to more power; and using more powerful heroes often makes it easier to do interesting and fun things, so I like those heroes perhaps less for themselves but more for the kind of things they can enable.

But then less powerful heroes also sometimes have interesting and fun abilities, so my favourites can be spread across the spectrum of power (of course this also helps my view of those heroes who are just straightforwardly powerful and help to enable these fun strategies)

Part of it has to do with how many games I've played (dear god, so many...) and the size of my card pool. In the early days, I relied on the likes of Dain, Arwen, and Glorfindel to have a decent shot at the harder quests, but as my options grewÂ I felt more confident in trialing less powerful heroes. At the same time, I got tired of some of the old stalwarts, whose effects -Â as has been mentioned - are often passive and not particularly interesting. Now, I tend to get the most enjoyment from heroes who offer specialized deck-building possibilities or synergize with less frequentlyÂ used cards and archetypes: Folco, Haldan, Spirit Dain,Â Damrod, Tom Cotton, etc. The game has done a great job in these last two expansions (after what I considered a lackluster Harad cycle) in opening up new playstyles.

I do think Tactics Eowyn has a good chance at coming out on top because she's the best combination of powerful yet still interesting, and she ticks so many boxes: strong theme, great art, low threat, efficient stats, top questing (in tactics no less), and with an ability that'sÂ not only strong but also flexible (save it for a boss, use it in an emergency, or get a handle on the game early).

Some interesting results:

* Sam Gamgee vs Cirdan the Shipwright was a tie

Biggest losers of this round were Caldara (7% vs Galadriel), Spirit Pippin (5% vs Thranduil), and Fatty Bolger ( 3% vs Thorin Oakenshield)
So not much love for those Spirit heroes, but perhaps they can redeem themselves in the next round! Vote now.

The new hero for The City of Ulfast, you can find her [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Lothiriel-TCoU?Lang=EN] on Hall of Beorn. In the books she is Imrahil's daughter ( a fact you can see reflected in her ability which is quite similar to her father's Tactics version) and after the War of the Ring she becomes Eomer wife (once again a fact you can see reflected in her gaining the Rohan trait when Eomer is in play).

This is your top 16 as of Round 3. But many heroes still have a chance of catching up. Round 4 is now available to vote on.

We had one tie in this round, Haldir vs Spirit Glorfindel. Other than that, I noticed that most matches are no longer as clear cut as they used to be. Many heroes only win by a margin of less than 10%.
One of the worst losers (besides Spirit Pippin) was Leadership Gimli, who lost 6% vs 94% against Sam.Â 
As for the battle between resources and card draw (Leadership Denethor vs Erestor), Erestor narrowly beat Denethor.
Hope to see some nice results for round 4 within a few days!

It looks like the second to right column is a measure of "opponent score", which is a common tie-breaker in swiss pairings. In other words, the heroes that Dori has lost against on average have a higher score than those that Legolas has lost against and point difference is only a tie-breaker after that.

By the end of the swiss rounds a few of top 16 heroes will likely be decided based on this metric

This is the reason why I've always liked Balin and Bifur. They're fairly low threat, decent stat lines (2 wp), and have highly splashable utility abilities that can benefit a range of decks. I think it's a shame that they're both standing in the bottom quartile.

I agree that Balin and especially Bifur are much better heroes than their performance in this tournament so far would imply - though they both have had the misfortune of going up against a version of Eowyn, which would be a rough matchup for any hero. I'd put Balin and Bifur solidly in the middle of the pack, but both are currently in the bottom quarter. This is way too low for how useful they can be.

Having said that, I don't think they are comparable to Legolas. Balin and Bifur are, as you say, highly splashable utility heroes - you include them for their sphere, their low threat, and their abilities. You use Legolas for his low threat and his stats - the ability is just a bonus.

How much better would Balin and Bifur be if they had three willpower and only one defense?

I mean, 3 wpÂ would be amazing... but probably OP for Bifur, whose stats are just fine for his 7 threat (though it'd be nicer to have 2 att rather than 2 def). Balin at least has 4 hit points to go with his 2 def, meaning he can survive a medium sized enemy in a pinch, which isn't useless.

I wonder if they're bigger problem is that they don't have much direct/specializedÂ synergy with popular contemporary archetypes. Both are great utility heroes, but only synergize specifically with dwarf swarm or attachment decks, neither of which are hugely popular (and have arguably better hero choices). I think that both heroes, especially Balin, get better in multiplayer, which may also hurt their chances in this competition. It may also be that dwarves just aren'tÂ in vogue today.

## 51 [pmdoug on December 4, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/302570-2019-heros-tournament/?do=findComment&comment=3842193)

Balin and Bifur also benefit greatly from Unlikely Friendship, given that Balin is in Leadership and Bifur works quite well with Silvan decks. Unfortunately, theyÂ each have only theÂ Dwarf trait, which limits them outside of dedicated dwarf decks in which they're competing with the vast gaggle of tribal-Dwarf heroes.Â They're great splash heroes and fantastic with 2+ players. Bifur is also one of only 5 heroes whose stat total is less than their printed threat, and he's the only hero who's under-costed without a clear catch: Beorn is immune to player cards, S Glorfindel raises threat and guilt levels, Na'asiyah cannot pay for allies, and Smeagol will likely turn on you. T Eowyn effectively has him beat there, but she's arguably the best hero in the entire game so that's not really a knock on Bifur. Elladan and Elrohir are sort of under-costed when played together, but that's a big restriction. Mirlonde is effectively under-costed, but then her ability is essentially blank if she's the only Lore hero. If Bifur was made today, would he be 8 threat? Or is hisÂ resource-smoothing ability considered a step below the traditional power curve, thus justifying the -1 to his threat cost? I suppose the argument might be that his ability doesn't actually gainÂ you anything measurable: no stats, resources, readying, or knowledge has actually been gained because you paid a resource for another resource.Â 

Grima,Â Â Elrond, Lo Bilbo, T Bilbo, T Beregond, S Beregond, Galadriel, Hirluin, S Theoden, T Theoden, Folco, and T Merry are all heroes with inflated printed threat. Folco, T Merry, and T Theoden essentially begin the game on par or better. Hirluin is expected to ramp up so quickly from passive ally boosts that his starting threat is anything but too high. So really we're left withÂ Grima,Â Elrond, Lo Bilbo, T Bilbo, T Beregond, Galadriel, and S Theoden as the actual inflatedÂ threat heroes. Grima, T Beregond, andÂ S Theoden are allÂ heroesÂ that reduce the cost of cards, andÂ that might beÂ considered an ability strong enough to justify an extra +1 to threat cost. Though I'd argue that it doesn't in S Theoden's case, and that he inherited his inflated threat from his Tactics version, which is exactly what happened to S Beregond. And why doesn't Damrod get a +1 to threat cost? Is it because he's less likely to play a trap every turn than S Theoden is to play a Rohan ally? Elrond's healing and Galadriel's abilities are definitly powerful enough to justify their threat cost. Poor Bilbo is just a bizarre design, but drawing an extra card in solo is quite powerful and I can almost understand what they were going for. On the whole, it seems like consistent cost reduction, uniquely powerful abilities, and being Bilbo are the three main causes of inflated threat cost.Â

Excellent analysis... and poor Bilbo. His Lore version has a very powerful passive ability, but what about his tactics version? I haven't played with T Bilbo much, but do you think it similarly justifies an increased threat?

I strongly dislike the formula that makes Theoden and Merry higher threat. Yes, with their abilities, their stats increase and justify the threat increase, but getting +1 willpower or attack is hardly a strong ability and I don't think it justifies the increase in threat. Theoden in particular would be much more playable with a threat of 11.

Let's be' honest: merry at 6Â is robbery. With hobbits fellows he gets 3 attack plus a strong repeatable ability equating to 2 threat less than his actual stats plus ability to ready another character in combact phase... 4 attack in sagas when frodo is in play.

Without hobbits he is still 2 wp for 6 threat in tactic.Â  By far the best and cheaper quester in sphere until eowyn arrived. Merry is very good with 6 threat and would be unfairly good atÂ 5.

Theoden is clearly better when the count of questing tactics heroes rise, especially in multiplayer OR as centerpiece of a voltron deck.Â As stand alone tacticÂ  questing hero he is just too expensiveÂ to be considered good.Â 

Lore Bilbo on the other hand is just overpricedÂ Â and more so with an extended carpool. The ability is strongÂ  in solo, good in two players, nice or meh in 3 or 4 playersÂ  depending from your personal feeling. Â Even in the early time of the game the ability was not enough to cover a gap of 3 treath vs his actual stats. Also the stat distribution is not great and has worsened during the game maturity.Â  His lore version was at the center of one killer deck inÂ early game along with fast hitch, a burning brand and love of tales but outside that....

Tactic bilbo is better having actual stats better than his printed one and compensating for the most the threat gap plus a sinergizing ability which can be quite good in quite a few decks. At least this version has 2 abilities which make sense, Â synergize between themselves and provide something that isÂ not so easy to come by even with the modern carpoolÂ

I always thought that Lore Bilbo had three extra threat as he drew you one card compared to Beravor's two cards and six extra threat, because you will most likely use her for her ability and all her stats are wasted. Sure, you can give her an Unexpected Courage to actually use these stats, but here Bilbo has the advantage of using his without the need for readying, though aside from the willpower there is not much you can do without attachments.

It's funny, if Lo Bilbo and Beravor switched their abilities, I'd be happy. I wouldn't mind exhausting Bilbo for draw as much as I mind exhausting Beravor. And Beravor is a far better third hero in a solo deck than Bilbo. As it stands, I will nearly always prefer to play Beravor over Bilbo because she draws more cards, incentivizes readying, and selects who draws the cards. If Bilbo was 7 threat or 9 threat with high willpower, or even 1 higher attack, I'd like him. I'm not really sure what it is about Bilbo that made them think low willpower, low attack, and decent defense. I suppose it's thematically Old Bilbo, but even then Bilbo was a cheeky senior planning to escape to Rivendell. Doesn't seem right that he has the same willpower as homebodies like Fatty and Tom Cotton.Â

Beaver is a great hero choice, even better now with more readying options and far less need of her stats because of allies power creep vs base game.

With 2 resource cost you can pay for a 2w or attack rally with ease even in-sphere.Â

Well, I must call her Beaver from now on.Â 

I will always have a fondness for her because the friend I play with would always run her in the early days and I would leech that card draw with my 0 draw leadership decks.Â 

Beravor offers choices and options, while Bilbo is just a solid passive on a terrible body.Â

Round 4 is over, the poll is now on round 5 until the 8th of December.Â 

Quickbeam vs Smeagol was close by 1 vote in the favor of Quickbeam
Spirit Frodo beat Leadership Frodo
Beorn was surpassed by his son Grimbeorn in the Beorning cagematch.

Well they are the firstborn children of Iluvatar so there's that hahaha.

Also some thoughts from this round, FirstlyÂ LOLÂ at Bombur V.S. Fatty battle of the bottom, likewise Bilbo against Tom is an equal battle of mediocre hobbit types.Â The internal battle between Saruman and Treebeard was epic for me haha. Galadriel and Elrond, Eowyn and Cirdan, Arwen and Gandalf, Radagast and Eowyn, and Haldir and Sam are all going to beÂ pretty close matchups.Â 

Â 

Also was anyone else looking at Nori and Ori and scratching their head trying to remember which was which?

Ori is the dwarf who wrote last in the Book of MazarbÃ»l, so he is the Lore hero (he is depicted writing a book). Ã“in and his brother GlÃ³in used the tinderbox to make campfires in The Hobbit as seen in the art and Nori is the drinking dwarf who reduces threat when new dwarves are played, though I cannot see a connection between their abilities and their art.

Late again, but I didn't have the energy for the tournament last night. THe current round (round 7) is a very interesting one since it will decide which hero will be the only one left that remains undefeated, Eowyn or Arwen.

Â 

Other matchups that are worth noting are Leadership Faramir v Leadership Boromir

Fatty v Spirit Pippin

Leadership Gimli v Spirit Legolas

And many more. Vote now!

Eowyn is beating Arwen and by a slightly bigger margin than Gandalf is ahead of the elf-lord. And Legolas is being steadily beaten by Cirdan for some reason haha. Same with Boromir, the Tactics fellowship heroesÂ needÂ some love. Its also fun to see the Sands of Harad deluxe friends combat each other. And the two sons of denethor vying for leadership supremacy.Â

I voted Arwen > Eowyn (though these may be the two best heroes in the game) and Elrond > Gandalf... so this is a bit sad.

Cirdan, on the other hand, is way more powerful than Legolas (even though I do love Legolas). 4 will power with that amazing card selection ability? He would be one of my favorites even without Narya.

He's definitely a top class hero for sure, one of the best in Spirit and hey they have some competition. But I assumed with more players having core set heroes experience, Legolas popularity from the Lore versus Cirdan and his amazing ability to quest via destructionÂ and advance at weird times (him with a readying effect +Â Support of the Eagles on offense or pumped full of weapons and using Hour of Wrath and he can "quest" for much more than 4 willpower and deal with the mountain enemies problem at any player count.Â

My wife loves Legolas for these reasons (though we haven't used Support of the Eagles with him - usually just some basic weapons + black arrow) and I do think he remains one of the best attacking heroes. His low threat combined with the ranged keyword and high attack is great, even leaving out his ability which is quite good. My wife plays him with Arwen/Eowyn and a version of Beregond, and her deck is very strong with these specialized heroes.

I would still argue that Cirdan has a greater impact on our games though when I play him.

And it seems most agree with that assessment haha. It's interesting though that power has such an affect of favorites, I feel like who the character is in the lore is the biggest draw for me and then I tend to go to the more powerful versions of that character (tactics Legolas and Boromir) and Lore Aragorn. Dwarves are very strong but I have no interest in them to play and would definitely not rank them among my favorites despite their strength. Similar to Cirdan, he's a cool elf but is in the same grouping for me as Erestor. My wife loves playing with him as part of an Arwen/Caldera deck and I know he is solid but to us it seems like more of a subtle strength that contributes to the discard allies/Noldor theme but doesn't help out as much on the combat-heavy quests.Â

Cirdan's power certainly is more subtle - which is fitting for his place in the lore. My favorite heroes are often ones that open up interesting decisions, like Tactics Eowyn or Thurindir. When playing Cirdan, you start each turn by deciding which card to keep, and then once he has Narya you decide how to most effectively utilize his actions - which allies do you ready? At what point should you do so?

That's probably our problem, we have Narya pretty much stapled to Hobbit ally Gandalf who usually just wants to ready himself for the extra stat bump on top of all of his other awesomenessÂ haha. But thanks for the dialogue, cool to see different perspectives!

Final Round of Swiss matches!!!

Round 8 has now started, which is the last chance for some heroes to make it to the final 16. For now, both Beregonds defend the final two spots on the list, it will be hard getting them out of there.Â 

Tactics Eowyn won from Arwen and is now our unbeaten champion.Â 
In the bottom ranks, we find Fatty Bolger who has now lost all rounds, even against Spirit Pippin.

Vote now for round 8 and I will draft the bracket after the results of that round are in!

Very surprised that Radagast ended up so high. I like him, but for some reason I thought the community was more mixed on him. It's definitely not just his novelty, because Smeagol came in near the very bottom. I wager that his mechanical and thematic restrictions turn people away, which I understand. I have a hard time justifying his place in most decks and scenarios.Â 

Spirit Beregond shocked me. He's good for sure, but I never would have guessed that people were so fond of him. I find him a bit dull, and still prefer his Tactics version.Â 

I'm interested to see if the Silvan or Dwarf tribal leader will win out. I prefer Celeborn, but Dain is his people's only hope in the top 16. Poor dwarves... they really should have been given more versatile and powerful heroes. T Thorin and S Dain are a step in the right direction, but I still want a version of Gimli that can go in most decks.Â 

The top 16 is comprised of 1 dwarf, 1 beorning, 1 hobbit, 2 istari, 2 silvan, 4 noldor, and 5 humans. Eowyn is the only hero with 2 versions in the top 16, and her spirit version is the only Core Set hero to make it. The next closest core heroes are T Legolas at 19 and then Beravor at 40.Â 

With only 3 unknown heroes left, I wonder if any of them will shake up the current standings. Is there a new hero that could ever steal the crown from the triumvirate of Elrond, Arwen, and Eowyn?Â

Here's the sphere breakdown for the top 16:

Spirit: 5
Leadership:Â 4
Lore:Â 4
Tactics:Â 2
Neutral: 1

So definitely weighted toward Spirit and against Tactics (though if we take the top 20 tactics makes a comeback with Beorn, Legolas, and Boromir).

Interestingly, however, if we look at the top 50, the sphere split is remarkably even:

Spirit: 12
Leadership:Â 12
Lore:Â 13
Tactics:Â 12
Neutral: 1

It would seem that the designers have done a good job balancing among the spheres, at least, even if not among the races (poor dwarves).

High Willpower seems to be the king stat, which makes sense. It's the most essential stat, and having 1 hero that can reliably quest for 3+ is so useful.Â 

4 with 4 wp, 5 with 3 wp, 3 with 2 wp, 2 with 1 wp, and 2 with 0 wp.Â 

The only 2 (?) heroes with 0 wp made the top 16, but that's because they're amazing defenders. Being able to defend early is a huge boon.Â 

The only dedicated attacker to make the top 16 is Haldir, unless you count Lo Aragorn or Grimbeorn. This makes sense since loading up attack power on one character is rarely as essential as it is with willpower and defense. Heroes like Haldir and Grimbeorn can use high attack power in ways that other attackers can't, and that makes them very powerful. However, there are a bunch of great attackers just outside the top 16 to counter this argument.Â

As for winners, I am glad to see both old and new heroes in this list. My hopes are up for Celeborn and Dain, but I'm sure that the others will put up a good fight. Still, nice to see that the unreleased heroes made it this far, but I'm sorry for those hoping on Beorn or Erestor. They didn't quite make the cut.

I believe we are just missing 2 more heroes from the current cycle. Since Thorin was revealed to be in Wrath and Ruin, I am willing to bet the fortune of Erebor on the fact that Gildor Inglorion will be our second Leadership hero. That leaves us with a Tactics hero and a Spirit hero that are as of yet unknown. Lot of rumours going on about who they may be, but I couldn't wait with the tournament until those two were revealed. Besides, top 100 sounds better than top 102.Â

I know people are itching for Spirit Aragorn, and I'm all for that. I'd actually be really pleased if the last Tactics hero is an Easterling warrior with a weapon/armor theme.Â

I'm shocked that someone would consider SpBeregond dull, and yet like his Tactics version better.Â  I personally find repeatable threat reduction much more interesting than reducing the cost of Gondorian Shield from 1 to 0.

I don't findÂ Tactics Beregond to be that exciting either, but Bartering and Long Lake Trader make his cost reduction fun to play around with. T Beregond also makes items like Spear of the Citadel and Raven-winged Helm easier to play. I enjoy direct damage decks, and T Beregond aids those. I'm sure there are cool combos to use with S Beregond, but I've likely missed them because I haven't used him much.Â My love of S Dain might also contribute to my ambivalence towards S Beregond, as does S Beregond's so-so art.Â

I've been a little late, but the first set of finals matches has now been completed. I had to settle a tie between Sam and Aragorn. I went with Sam, as he scored higher on the initial scoreboard.

Quarter-finals are looking interesting, so I hope everyone will vote fair and will make up their mind on these tough choices.Â

Nice quite the finish! Just curious as to who everyone's favorite 4 heroes are to see if this is the final you would have chosen?

Â 

Mine:

Â 

1. Legolas (Tactics)

2. Boromir (Tactics)

3: EleanorÂ 

4. ElrondÂ 

(though any of the Istaris could have slipped into the final spot for me, and Eowyn in both forms is amazing)

Â 

And my wife's:

Â 

1. HirluinÂ 

2. Prince Imrahil (Leadership)

3. Aragorn (Lore though she loves the Leadership one too)

4. Eowyn (Spirit)

I understand Eleanor's potential to totally save the game in certain quests, but I've struggled to make consistent use of her. What's your favorite deck/hero lineup to use her in? I imagine tactics + Gondorian shield is the best way to make sure her action isn't wasted.Â 

My top 4 are my favorite from each sphere: Sam, Lo Aragorn, Cirdan, and Mablung. I was pleased to see three of those four make it quite far in theÂ contest.Â 

The actual final 4Â are all very powerful and,Â more importantly,Â very fun. You have the two courageousÂ mortals (Eowyn and Sam) who boastÂ high willpower, low threat, and action advantage. Then you have two of the most canonically powerful beings in Middle Earth (Gandalf and Galadriel), who offer abilities seen no where else in the card pool, and who come with their own artifacts. I'm curious to see who will win between T Eowyn and Gandalf. I prefer Gandalf,Â but my money is on T Eowyn.Â

As soon as I saw this poll I told my brother that Tactics Eowyn would win. Here she is in the top 4, and Im not surprised. She is just too good, and what other hero can really compete with her efficiency?

4 willpower for only 6 threat? In tactics? And she can obliterate almost any one enemy, maybe more if you can ready her at the right moment.Â 

Probably the most splashable hero in the game, and it only makes sense that she is so popular with everyone.

She beat out Arwen hero and EVERYONE plays Arwen hero all the time. I love watching videos like Mr Underhills and Cardboard otr, but the amount of times I see hero Arwen in their decks is crazy. The fact the Eowyn beat her in a poll goes to show just how good she really is.

She is definitely a little bit trickier in solo where Action advantage is important I ran her through a campaign with:

Glorfindel Spirit/Eleanor/Legolas Tactics

-combined with tons of high willpower spirit allies, all of the Threat reduction and the key piece Hobbit ally Gandalf, her low threat combined with the others pretty much starts you in secrecy so you can play threat reduction, some resourceful attachments (all on Eleanor) and then I put Gondorian Shield and Livery of the tower on her so she can soak archery damaged, surprise treacheries and so on. Gandalf ally is amazing and so are many of the nigh willpower spirit allies, soÂ having a way to cancel game-ending treacheries and save key allies is great.Â 

Â 

I'm currently running her with Spirit Legolas and Elrond as withÂ the release of The One Ring she has been boosted up to awesome levels, just start with inner Strength on her and she is your defender from the start.Â

The finals are here, and it will be Tactics Eowyn against Gandalf the Grey. Both amazing heroes, but only one will be crowned the community's favourite hero.

In the bronze match, we got Sam against Galadriel, so be sure to vote for that one as well. You have until the end of this year to cast your vote, after which I will announce the winner in an article covering the entire tournament:Â https://challonge.com/LOTRLCGHero2019finals [https://challonge.com/LOTRLCGHero2019finals]

Ohhh noes! Gandalf beat Eowyn in the final match. Rohans, where were your support?

Way to go Gandalf! The Wizard reigns supreme. Tactics Eowyn rocks as well but I findÂ Gandalf more fun with all the tricks he can pull off and how well he fits into pretty much any deck.

Is there any particular reason Firefox does not show the polls but IE does?

Not that I know. The poll is showing up on my Firefox browser, so it might be a problem on your end. I have had little trouble with those side-bar polls in the past and they seem to work in all of my browsers.Â

I don't see them, too. Maybe it is because of I am on my mobile?! All I see is some sort of head line:

Yeah the headline is just simple text. The poll itself is a piece of HTML code that might not be picked up by Firefox on mobile then. But you will still be able to vote through other browsers. I'll have to check and see if I can do anything about the code, but it is probably not a problem on my end. But thanks for letting me know though

I do not know anything about browser engines and such back-end things, but I do not use Firefox - if that is of importance...

It worked for me in safe mode, but nothing else in the options made the polls visible.
