In case you didn't see this www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=2471]

Gollum as a creature you need to keep alive.

Be sure to click on their "tantrums [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/ffg_content/lotr-lcg/Return-to-Mirkwood/wasted-provisions.png]" link to see that Treachery card. Nasty stuff.

"The truth will be revealed when this final chapter of the Shadows of Mirkwood cycle releases in the fourth quarter of 2011."

If this statement is true, then FFG has to release the expansions of the Mirkwood-Cycle faster than just once a month...

Obviously Gollum is begging for "Self Preservation"... :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

or Radagast as the zoo keeper (Gollum is a "creature")

im not sure you can play this to him. Since he is not a character only objective. But heal by Radagast i think can since he is a creature.

Oooh, here's hoping they keep up that schedule and announce/release the first deluxe expansion for December!  Fingers crossed.

So by the upcoming reckoning (which I have been told is far from accurate) we have -

July

 * Shadows of Mirkwood: Hunt for Gollum

August

 * Shadows of Mirkwood: Conflict at the Carrock
 * Shadows of Mirkwood: A Journey to Rhosgobel

September

 * Shadows of Mirkwood: The Hills of Emyn Muil
 * The Massing at Osgiliath  (Print on demand, one month from Gen Con)

October

 * Shadows of Mirkwood: The Dead Marshes

November

 * Shadows of Mirkwood: Return to Mirkwood

Plus the art sleeves which are now due "third quarter".

2 packs in August would just be: "COOL" ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

I'm getting the feeling this scenario is going to be another near-impossible for solo.

The German publisher has officially announced the release dates for Germany (German versions of the expansion):

 

Hunt for Gollum - 19th July

Conflict at the Carrock - 4th August

Taking the fact that they cant publish anything before FFG does, that means 4th August is the world wide release date for Carrock...

I'd love it if they released two packs 2 weeks apart! That would ease some anxiety for new cards.
