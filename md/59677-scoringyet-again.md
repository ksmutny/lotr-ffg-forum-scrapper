All this talk of scoring recently has got me thinking back to last year, when I'm sure I remember there being a change to the official scoring guidelines than those laid out on p22 of the rulebook. I didn't want to start off another thread in what seems to be becoming a very choked forum, but I've spent the best part of 45 minutes wading through pages of stuff here to no avail (and at five to one in the morning, there are other places I could be...)

So could anyone quickly let me know, has the official scoring method from FFG changed from p22? I seem to be convinced that it has, though can find no evidence as such. (But then it is very late...) Thanks happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]

 Yes, check the site and look at the FAQ from 10/31/11.

Excellent - thanks for that! I wouldn't've thought to check the FAQ. As I said, it's late lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif] 

Thanks again!
