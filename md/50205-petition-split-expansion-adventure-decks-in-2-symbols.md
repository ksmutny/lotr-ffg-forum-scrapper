# [petition: split expansion adventure decks in 2 symbols](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/50205-petition-split-expansion-adventure-decks-in-2-symbols/)

the title actually says it all. if the expansion adventure cards have 30 cards all with the same symbol it makes them very hard to use in custom scenarios. if they would be split in 2 or 3 parts with different symbols it won't hurt the expansion in any way, but it would also make them great for designing custom scenarios. it would even help ffg yourself if you want to re-use them in future expansions.

the split can, but does not need to be thematically. just having 2 identical sets with slightly different symbols would be sufficient, so i could use only half of them in a custom scenario if i wanted to.

im not sure i understand what you are proposing?  by "symbols" do you mean spheres?

 And by "adventure cards" are you talking about player cards or the encounter cards.  I think your talking about encounter cards.  While you are correct that there would be more flexibility with two encounter sets in an adventure pack, I don't know if it is harder to make custom quests with a larger encounter set.

I'm not sure this is a problem at all. Right now everything's tight since the game is just starting off, but just 6 months from now when the full first cycle of Adventure packs are out, there will be at least 13 different Encounter sets already, I think. That's pretty good and it will only continue to grow from there.

yes i mean encounter cards. sorry =)

when designing a custom scenario i want flexibility. the most important choice in my oppinion is the cards used in the encounter deck. if the encounter deck is too big there is too much dillution. 30-40 cards seems to be large enough. that means, if just one symbol already has 30+ cards i have little options to add other cards. and very little options to merge two such decks, when each of them is already large enough for a full scenario.

my suggestion doesn't hurt anyone, it just offers better flexibility for designing future scenarios (like ffg, but also some community members). there won't be any difference for everyone who is just playing the ffg scenarios.

i see your point but if i was making a completely custom scenario, i would choose which cards i would include in the encounter deck the same as i would for my player deck.  it seems, so far, people are just using the preset symbols and mixmatching, but perhaps the next phase in the custom scenarios is actually choosing each card individually just as deckbuilders are doing.

Having an encounter deck with 90 cards does seem pretty excessive, and thinking of it that way, yes, smaller encounter sets would be nice.  I am interested to see which sets the rest of the Shadows of Mirkwood cycle will use for their quests.  If they are always paired with the five sets from the core set that is kind of lame.

Wait, are you guys saying that the Adventure pack encounters are using the same symbols as the core set? For some reason I was assuming they were going to be new ones each Adventure pack, but it sounds like that's wrong. If so, then yeah that does sound not quite as good.

## 9 [reno1051 on July 20, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/50205-petition-split-expansion-adventure-decks-in-2-symbols/?do=findComment&comment=502151)

i think they each have a new symbol but still utilize some from the core set (quests utilize 2-3 symbols so 1 from the new pack and 2 from the core).  i would think in future packs they would start using some from previous packs depending on the theme of those encounter decks.

No offense to the OP, but I just can't believe the things people find to complain about with this game. If you want a smaller pool of cards for your custom scenario, just write out a list of which encounter cards are to be used. If you're going through the trouble of creating and balancing a custom scenario, taking the extra 2 minutes to write out a list of encounter cards just doesn't seem like that big of a deal.

Ha ha ha, :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]  Ah the facebook culture.

It is a little premature to make any real complaints against the game.  Maybe once the Shadows of Mirkwood cycle has been completely released, but hopefully there's nothing substantial.

This is exactly how I feel. It's so hard for me to process people talking about banning cards, complaining about balance, and lobbying petitions to add more encounter set symbols when the only cards I have in my hands are a STARTER SET. It just makes no sense to me.

100% agree. Sounds like a good idea anyway for future custom scenarios.

But: The less card you have in  an encounter deck, the more predictive it is what enemies and locations will come up. I am not sure if I always would like to know that.

Surely THAT's the complaint- that we only have a starter set. Hopefully it'll all change tomorrow though!

We don't know for sure that future expansion packs won't have multiple encounter symbols in them. I can't see what problems it would cause, so I'd probably sign your petition if there was one, but I don't think custom scenario builders are a top priority for FFG.

funny, i wasn't complaining at all. but people always find something to misunderstand and flame.

of course handpicking cards would be best for custom scenarios. but it won't happen for a single reason: who wants to spend half an hour before every game to search each single card? and after the game sort them back into their card pools? no one. i wouldn't even want to do it for my own scenarios. there is also no place on the scenario card to write a list of 20+ cards and i really like the place restriction that comes when keeping to the original scenario card size and layout.

therefore successful custom scenarios will have to use the preset encouter decks, at least as a basis.

i will just repeat myself: what i suggest hurts no one, and helps modders, and likely even FFG themselves. of course you have to expect getting flamed in this forum as soon as you voice any oppinion. but it still always surprises me how stupid some people are (yes, you may flame me for that statement, i will stop posting in this thread).

One easy fix I was thinking for this, if you use card sleeves, just take a Sharpie and make a small symbol, like an 'X' somewhere on the card sleeve for the ones for 'X' custom scenario. Then they could be quickly sorted in/out just like any other Encounter cards without harming the cards.

I've done this in the past with a bunch of different card games for quick sorting purposes.

It's just like putting together a player deck. And most people have two core sets anyway, so they could just set the custom deck aside. Even if they don't, putting together that deck would take no more than 3 minutes, not 30.

It's the internet. If you want to have a conversation about something with the entire planet at the same time, you have to be ready for people to ask questions and critique your ideas. It's not personal, its an attempt to have an honest conversation and debate about topics that are of similar interest. Just pump the brakes on the overreacting.

 Letsdance, i actually totally agree with you.  A little better organisation for fan made content would be greatly appreciated.  FFG hopefully will support such content like Bethseda has with modders for their Elder Scrolls video game.  Having that fan made content just improves the enjoyment and possibilitiesc of the game and makes different than most others.  i would assume that's what they are after.
