I was just wondering if anyone else has noticed that you can keep all of the quests in the current cycle constructed.

In the previous cycles, the quests all shared a few of the encounter decks from the deluxe box, but this cycle is only using each encounter set once. I know that there are still two quests to go, but there are still a few encounter sets unused as well... So we might be able to pre-construct all six quests without having to buy a second heirs of numenor box

Sounds good to me, I hope they keep that up in all the future cycles because it's a pain having to separate out all the encounter sets all the time

I had the same hopes, but Blood of Gondor uses the Ravaging Orcs sets.  That is the same set used by EaAD.  I also have this feeling that the Morgul Vale with use Mordor Elite, which is used by AoO.

They shouldn't avoid using encounter sets for this reason - I'd rather have more complex quests and need 2 sets.  They'd also rather I bought 2 sets.

 

(I don't mind shuffling quest decks and make do with 1 set :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png])

Sorting out encounter deck by icons can be tedious, but the card number (like, 7/12, 3/8) makes it easy to keep track and make sure you haven't lost any cards. Noticed recently that not all sets have these, though. Wonder why.

One thing I find interesting with the heirs of Numenor encounter sets is that it appears one if them, creatures of the forest, will not appear in any APs. I thought it would certainly end up in blood of Gondor evidently that's not the case. The forest theme doesn't seem like a fit for Morgal Vale either.

We're any of the KD sets not used in the darrowdelf APs? Don't remember off hand but I do know the first 3 APs all used that misty mountains set that wasn't used in KD.

i don't think the one with the book was ever used in the KD cycle. what was that book called, i cant remember... it begins with M i think. you had to attach it to someone

They started numbering the cards when Khazad Dûm came out and have done so ever since.

Three KD encounter sets were only used in the KD quests - Into the Pit, The Seventh Level and Flight From Moria.
