 That is all.

Just imagine how much worse that card would be if it was awake!

 I've found that with careful planning, Sleeping Sentry isn't always an auto-lose event.

There have been a few times when I've put less strength into a questing than I normally would have and it payed off.

There are also an increasing number of methods to mitigate its danger. Things that ready characters or let you take cards from the Encounter Deck and Test of Wills of course.

Removing cards from the Encounter deck - 'Out of the Wild' - leads to interesting choices and in multiplay, a lot of discussion.  There are some very nasty Treacheries out there like 'Sleeping Sentry', which make obvious candidates, but some Enemies and Locations can be more long term nuisances.  In a recent random Hero, 2 full deck/sphere replay of the first quest, I only had 5 cards in the deck, including 'Hummerhorns' and 'Ungoliants Spawn'.  Both had to be left in as 'Hummerhorns' has Victory points and I hadn't reach part 3 to see if I needed to kill the big guy.

This led me to think about what is best to remove from the game.  Within the restrictions on the card, is a nasty Treachery worse than a bad blocking Location or a really tough Enemy?  You usually get quite a bit of choice with 5 cards and the current situation makes a big difference, but a permenant removal of an Encounter card is not to be taken lightly.  'Sleeping Sentry' is a good choice, but what else is an automatic choice?  Cheers!

Who doesn't my friend! However, I still think that "Exhausted" card (deal 2 damage to each exhausted character) from Journey to Rogsgobel is worse. In fact, I really hate that scenario in general.

All I have to say is: Denethor! And if you happen to be running A Test Of Will as well, no problem at all.

SS as Treachery isn't a game-ender, when you get it as Shadow Effect is when you lose 4-6 heroes and anywhere up to 10+ allies. When you get 3-5 Enemies engaged, tough to guess that Burning Brand on the right Enemy. Assuming you've even drawn BB or Hasty Stroke and if you have latter, haven't had your resources wiped out by one of those discard 3 resources Treacheries.

Denethor's usefulness tends to diminish as you add more players.

 Having now run into this card three times, I have to agree.  I am not sure there is any real good argument for it's design.  Cards like these will always feel like some kid was making up a Dungeons and Dragons scenario on the fly and decides, "ummmm yeah…my mom came out of a pit and…and…you're all dead."
