Just finished a four player quest with Seastan, Esplanades and IanTFTC, what a great quest!  I think this one will be a beast solo.  The quest attacks you from so many different angles.

Hey, and where are all the people that were waiting for Thranduil? We're actually getting him! I'm pretty excited to have and play with the new hero.

This quest is a beast.  (Official DL is 7.)  The dragon Dagnir relentlessly attacks for 7 one or more times per turn, first attacking the town of Hrothgar's Hill and then both the hill and you.  Chump blocking is only partially successful because when she is attacking the town "excess damage must be dealt to Hrothgar's Hill" and when she's attacking you there are many shadow effects that cause her excess damage to go on the hill anyway.  Hrothgar's Hill essentially has 50 hit points and you lose when 50 is reached.

It's been a while since we have faced a quest so difficult, especially solo.

That is not surprising since the player card power is ever growing....

I am redoing my study the past weeks so my play time has been reduced. Looking forward to this quest as a treat to play in my revamped room

SPOILERS!!

While I really liked Roam, and though we took 3 unsuccessful shots at Fire this week, Fire might be my favorite of the series so far. It's just manageable enough to not be burdensome but also not a cakewalk. I love flipping over one quest card with the win and loss conditions on it already. My buddy and I are still trying to figure out the hero set we should bring and the corresponding deck synergies. We are thinking a stout defender like beregond, powered up to take hits.

I proxied him, been playing him for months. Silvans are my favorite and he works beautifully

Man bullroarer was right, this is a beast solo. It is a lot of fun but very difficult. Got a win on the 5th try.

Definitely matters the order you draw those side quests in.

Seems like Beregond with a pile of readying is a great idea although that isn't how I did it.

One angry dragon momma. It reminds me of a retooled battle of laketown. The idea of all those side quests being different things happening in the "battle" is thematically awesome and makes some interesting choices

Tried my Dunedain deck against it. Got lucky with the goblin side quest first. Got my Guardians of arnor online and made pretty quick work of the quest. Nabbing a second win.

We were also thinking a silvan deck with thranduil, celeborn, and galadriel on one side and a lore-tactics ent deck on the other, heroes TBD. Maybe beregond, dori, haldir? Thoughts?

I only play solo so not sure on multiplayer.

But you need a strong defender who can ready.  Ents may be too slow, not sure, also dernignle warrior won'tcut it. Silvans would be good if you can lay them out quickly, but that archetype doesnt have a solid defender, and chump blocking will not work (for the most part). Dagnir attacks for 7, once, twice, sometimes more than that. And you are punished in some cases for chumping through the main quest card.

Chumping is still possible. I manage to win with my silvan deck and I only succeed at blocking without dying twice on the game, on 10+ attacks.

Quick question: I still haven't bought the first two packs in this cycle but do you guys think I should buy this one first? I don't want it to sell out before I can get Thranduil and it's already more expensive on Amazon than the other two and lower stock on other sites. Thanks!

If you chump during planning, the unabsorbed damage gets placed on the hill.  Same goes for the treachery that makes her attack.  That hill racks up damage fast. Especially with the two side quests that help add damage.

Who did you have defending? My point was the silvans are fine as long as you have a defender in addition, which would not be silvan, unless you put ancestral armor on Thranduil and heal him.....

If you aren't hurting for money I think it is best to always buy what you can as this game is notorious for being out of print at times

I’m guessing he meant chump blocking in combat phase.  For me what works is the Dale allied with armour attachments and some good luck haha.

I understood that, but attacks in planning and quest coupled with 3 side quests that damage the hill require a defender.

The first time I beat it I slowly absorbed damage on my dale defenders just like you, until they each died in turn since I have no lore hero to put healing in my dale deck.

I would recommend to buy it asap. Always difficult to get 2 packs later on. And you don't need the previous pack to play this quest either.

I've tried this quest a few times over the last few weeks with a few different builds of silvan and noldor decks, solo and 2 handed, and haven't got close to a win yet, even on easy mode.

It’s tough for sure but I did beat it with Noldor Mill a couple times.  I went up to 3 Guardians of Rivendell and 3 Lords of the Eldar.  Many Guardians died, Glorfindel came back from the grave three times and Gildor at least once.

I haven't attempted with Noldor because I dont think the defense is there in my build, guardian and Narya is not enough.

By Monday I hope to have my next podcast episode out, and this quest will be what I cover.

I have beat it with 3 of the decks I keep built, so it can be done with a variety

That is what I was expecting, I love side quests too, cant wait to get the pack.

## 31 [Rouxxor on January 7, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/287785-fire-in-the-night-released/?do=findComment&comment=3583591)

Thalion is the reason why I'm building a side quest deck. That deck obviously include a send for aid, who work pretty well for finding Thalion if I don't draw him. So I haven't play any game without him becoming a hero at the turn three or four at the moment :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png].

I'm still convinced that Side quest deck is not as strong as other theme, since it is hard form him to recover a complicate staging area on turn one: if we can't explore side quest at the beginning of the game, we can't make our mechanic work so we don't grow properly and the situation become even harder.

## 32 [player1683311 on January 7, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/287785-fire-in-the-night-released/?do=findComment&comment=3583671)

You cant use that type of deck against a quest that hits hard right off the bat. But to even things out that archetype works great against any quest without traditional quest cards like mogul vale or assault on osgiliath.  I've used my side quest deck with a lot of success against a variety of quests. I proxied Thalion and he did not disappoint 

## 33 [Halberto on January 7, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/287785-fire-in-the-night-released/?do=findComment&comment=3584297)

Not yet tried a full side quest deck (meaning Thurindir + more than 1 side quest). 

Which  side quest in your opinion are not win more cards but strong early game tools to gain a pivital foothold against  the encounter deck?

I can see gather information.

keep watch is meaningfully impacting the game on the long run.

Double back is good too giving you the equivalent of 5 turns threat raise but seems in general less game changing.

Scout ahead is strong giving you 1 / 2 full turns of perfect knowledge and control on staging and shadow cards.

First, you don't want to be including your own side quests in this adventure.  Dagnir gives you no time and Caleb gives you plenty of side quests.  That said, I like Gather info, Double Back & Scout Ahead best.  I hope that we get more player side quests in the next cycle... ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

Thanks.  I was not thinking to this quest specially but to general terms.

With Thurindir I start with gather information.  If I don't  have a road goes on forever I will use it to fetch scout ahead. 

Then I like send for aid and prepare for battle a lot.

If I have time or need I play double back,  and I like storm comes which smooths out thalion and my tri sphere resources. 

 

Tactics sucks at questing and I never think to pop in their side quests (despite the battle ones)

My favourite might be Rally the West if I have three questing heroes, or in saga, or in coop; so mostly. I usually have that, Scout Ahead for Lore, Keep Watch for Tactics and Send for Aid for Leadership. I like how Rally the West make Thurindir quest for 4 suddenly, and it quickly might be enough just to quest with heroes in most cases...

As long as this thread has dissolved into a side quest discussion... I wish that Thurindir could play side quests of any sphere.

So my buddy and I beat it tonight. A slog, but one of my favorite quests of all time.

We ran Dori, tactics Beregond and Thurindir on one side with an ent built deck complemented with galadriel, celeborn, thranduil with silvan support. We were able to get courage on beregond and healing, and dori flexed in the defense as we needed it for beregond or thranduil. By the end of the game, either of them could take the dragon attack, and it was the ents that brought down the dragon. 

We ran with thalion and got him to hero status. He is a beast. And I dont know how you beat this quest without thurindir. The willpower/threat scales quickly.
