# [Dwarrowdelf bundles?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69954-dwarrowdelf-bundles/)

I'm overseas, so prefer ordering in bulk to cut down shopping costs.

A few months ago I bought the core set, the 6 Mirkwood packs, Moria, and Osgiliath all as part of a bundle. 

Is there a place to get the 6 Dwarrowdelf packs as a bundle?  (and, ideally, the Hobbit expansion as well)

Thanks!
