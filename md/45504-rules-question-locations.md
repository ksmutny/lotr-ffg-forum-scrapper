If you have a location in the staging area and place a number of progress tokens on it (through various card effects) equal to its quest points, is it discarded even though it is not an active location?  I would assume that it is, but wanted to get other people's opinions on the matter.

I would agree, the only thing I find is that locations are discarded when they have the requisite # of tokens...

Yeah, '6. Quest Points' description on page 6 makes this pretty clear, imo. And p.15 says 'if a location ever has as many progress tokens...'

Yes, I also agree those get discarded even if not active Locations.
