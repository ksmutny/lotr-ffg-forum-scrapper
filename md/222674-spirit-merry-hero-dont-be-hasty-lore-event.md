# [Spirit Merry (Hero) + Don&#039;t Be Hasty (Lore Event)](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/222674-spirit-merry-hero-dont-be-hasty-lore-event/)

Hi all! The Hobbit Pony and Late Adventurer cards aside, I wanted to figure out if a certain other card combo might work:

 

1) Say Spirit Merry is committed to a quest and still exhausted as an enemy is being revealed from the encounter deck. Can I play Don't Be Hasty in response to the enemy reveal so that Merry can reduce threat as a response to that same enemy reveal? This might only be applicable when several responses are literally being played simultaneously, but all I could find from the FAQ was:  

 

(1.37) Timing of effect resolution

When resolving multiple effects with a shared condition, players should use this order of resolution: passive abilities first, Forced effects second, Response actions third. When determining the order of effect resolution among abilities within those categories, players should first resolve abilities that use the word “when” and then resolve abilities with the word “after”. A player card effect that cancels an encounter card effect interrupts this timing structure. A cancel effect must be triggered immediately after the encounter card effect that it cancels.

 

Don't Be Hasty reads "When an encounter card is revealed but before resolving any of that card’s keywords or “when revealed” effects, choose a character committed to the quest. Ready that character and remove it from the quest."

 

Spirit Merry reads "After an enemy is revealed from the top of the encounter deck, exhaust Merry to reduce your threat by that enemy’s [Threat]."

 

Can this work, or is it illegal?

While on the topic of Hobbit combos, I would like to ask a couple other - bonus! - questions:

 

2) Can Good Meal reduce the cost of Stand and Fight (spirit event) having cost X? I know by FAQ that "Unless specified by a card effect, or granted player choice, the letter "X" is equal to 0." So as you "...lower the cost of the next event you play this round that matches attached hero's sphere by 2," the variable change in X as Stand and Fight is being played is taken into account as cost first, right? 

 

3) When playing Small Target (Spirit Event) on an enemy with 0 shadow cards, the effect is always a success, right? 

 

3.5) When playing Small Target (Spirit Event) on an enemy with 2+ shadow cards, you only have to choose one of the shadow cards, right? 

 

Thank you to whoever can answer - I really enjoy this game. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

1) Yes, I believe that combo is legal, because the Responses aren't technically being played "simultaneously". The Response with the When trigger is played first, and the Reponse with the After trigger is played next. So first, you play Don't Be Hasty and resolve it completely, readying Merry and removing him from the quest. Then the After trigger can happen, so you can use Merry's ability. Perfectly legal, and a good find.

 

2) Since the value X in Stand and Fight is set by the player's choice before paying the cost, I'd say that it has a known value by the time Good Meal kicks in, because Good Meal lowers the cost when you play it.

 

3) No. The enemy has to have a shadow card for the Small Target effect to trigger. No shadow card means you cannot fulfill the "a shadow card with no shadow effect" condition, so Small Target would be wasted in that case.

 

3.5) I believe the answer to this one is yes. It was discussed here: https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/122173-small-target-and-faceup-shadowcards/ [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/122173-small-target-and-faceup-shadowcards/]. The user named alogos, who maintains an unofficial FAQ, answered " Can't find the reference I really need to update my faq, but from memory, there was an answer from Caleb that says you choose only one. So a)"

Thanks, that helps a lot. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

I actually thought it may have been the other way around for #1; that is, in order for it to be a legal play, all viable responses need to be played simultaneously and that the FAQ excerpt I had read only clarified the order by which their effects are then applied. Don't Be Hasty just seemed too much like a "middleman" card in this situation, superseding - so to speak - the event of the enemy being revealed. If this was the case, I would expect that, by the time Merry is readied, the window to respond to the enemy reveal is closed as the window to respond to Don't Be Hasty is opened.    

 

I am definitely glad to have asked #3 because I was not actually expecting that answer, haha. It does make sense though (I will just have to be sure to adjust one of my decks).
