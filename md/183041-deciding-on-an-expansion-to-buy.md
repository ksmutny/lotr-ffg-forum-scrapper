Hey all. I'm trying to decide whether to buy Heirs of Numenor, Voice of Isengard or The Lost Realm. I'm also trying to base it partially on the packs that come afterwards also to get the most out of my purchase. I play some solo but about 75 percent of the time multiplayer. I have one Core Set, the entire Shadows of Mirkwood cycle, Khazad-dum, 4 out of 6 of the Dwarrowdelf cycle, both Hobbit expansions and The Black Riders. What would you guys recommend? Thanks

Heirs of Numenor is what I would do. Great deluxe box is very good with new mechanics that work and the adventure packs are just as good.

Heirs is great. The quests are quite tough, but very thematic.

HoN, but only because it is advisable to follow the release order. In terms os player cards, maybe Voice of Isengard, but the adventures of its following cycle are worst than the ones in Against the shadow cycle. On the other side, adventure packs after Lost Realm promise a lot of fun and wise innovation. If you don't mind following the chronological order, I would recommend you to buy Lost Realm.

If you do not insist upon buying in order of chronology then I'd go for:

Lost Realm (best quests of your mentioned boxes) or maybe The Voice of Isengard (the following cycle has definitly some fun missions). Have you considered The Road Darkens?

Heirs of Numenor
