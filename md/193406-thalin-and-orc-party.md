If orc party is in staging, and Thalin commited,

Thalin deals damage anyway? I think so, because Thalin damages before enemies are in staging area

 

 

isnt?

Thalin only damages enemies as they are revealed.

I think he means 'does Thalin damage Orc War Party?'  The card from the Into Chetwood quest that says enemies cannot be damaged while in the staging area.  

 

I think yes he can, because enemies are not placed in the staging area until you have revealed them and fully resolved their 'when revealed' effects, if any.  So there's a time there when the war party is not in the staging area and can be damaged.
