Ok, for those that havent read the books, the balrog is something of a funny character to portray. compared to John Howe and PJ's version, it is said to be much smaller, hidden in shadow, and the wings part is up for debate also. So seeing as one of the best parts of this game is that it gives a fresh non-peter jackson-view of tolkiens creation, how do you think the balrog will be portrayed?

 

personally i think the minotaur-ish portrayal is what we will see- which is great, it certainly not wrong, however it would be nice to see something a little different. for instance it was nice to see aragorn carrying narsil in the hero picture

In the iron Crown Enterprises Version, there were different versions of the (player character) Balrog. I think there were three, one flaming one, one slimy one, can't recall he third one. Maybe we'll get different versions for different encounter decks?

Meccg (one mentioned) had one Balrog avatar, character card. You could use him (it?) as is, but most people used one of the three mode cards available. Sadly, most also only used the Great Shadow Balrog, as it was easily the best from a gaming standpoint. Fiery Balrog or Slimy One could both be built around, but lacked the ridiculous power of the Shadow one (who was basically improved Sauron). Further, there were two hazard versions of it, Balrog of Moria and Durin's Bane. Throw in a sixth Balrog card as there was also an Ally card the minions could recruit.

I hope it is done well whatever version FFG will use.  Keep up the good work on the art for the cards and by the by when are the sleeves coming out (and why have the nazgul and daughter of nimrodel dropped)

Interesting Kuffdaddy - I was also wondering as to where the sleeves were? Espeically considering the bloody starwars ones are on their way to the stores and that LCG hasn't even been released yet!?? WTF!?

As for the Balrog - there is another thread which debates this here: http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=559078&efpag=1#588273 [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=559078&efpag=1#588273]

Essentially, a Balrog is a minor god - a Maia, as described in Tolkein's texts. The Istari are another form these high-powered beings took (Gandalf, Radagast, Saruman etc...).  The Balrog's were 'tac-nukes' of Morgoth's forces back in the first age, and many were either slain or sealed away by the elves and associated Maia (and possibly even the higher spirits themselves).

If you want to read more about these creatures, don't look to The Lord of The Rings - you should check out the Silmarillion for a bit more on how they were depicted and the power levels portrayed.

I have no issue with them being large and giant-sized. Giants were certainly a feature in Tolkiens books, so I don't think size would be an issue in context of lore.

Bring on Khazad Dum!

Yes i took part in that discussion, i think it was more what stats it would have and not so much on the appearance, and regardless of where you look there is no actual definitve appearance given to the balrogs, there are literally hundreds of pages on the internet discussing this and no conclusion has been made, perhaps by tolkiens own design this is so

dont get me wrong i have no problem with it being giant etc. it would just be nice to see i different approach

I think you're right Rich. I believe Tolkien purposefully designed the Balrog to be vague and up for imaginative interpretations from his audience. The text certainly leaves one not quite knowing what he is describing, but this certainly adds a very ancient and mysterious atmosphere to the scene. Enough of me ranting about how I feel...overall, I think it would be quite awesome if the gave him a goat-like body, hooves, horns, wings, etc. perhaps put some flames around him, and of course, we can't forget his sword and whip which should be engulfed in flame. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] No matter what interpretation the design team chooses, I am confident it will look great.

im a strong atheist and have ZERO wish to bring religion up in a forum i love,not to mention not wanting to spark yet another endless argument, BUT it must be noted here Tolkien was a strong catholic, and whether you like it or not, just like Melkor was probably in the image of the Devil, there is every chance balrogs were inspired by demons from hell.......i still think regardless FFG are going down that road, still i think we all are entitled to our own images, and i think whatever they use its gonna be awesome!

Well, Hell description changes from Dante's chamber of horror to Jean-Paul Sartre where it is a room with a couple of annoying strangers, so there is room to interpretation.

But I also like that Tolkien's world does not use Christian iconography. This is a good thing because it prevents any restrictions in the imaginary world setting. That is why I also like Lovecraft: his description of horror is not linked to Christian mythology, neither are his creatures and thus is really free of actual references and original.

very true, ive seen so many forums discuss links to religion in middle earth, but my opinion is, that if you want it to be there it can be, but this certainly does not mean it is forced upon you, ive read the books countless times and ive never once imagined anything in middle earth to be christian-like (probably why i can get so immersed in it) and i agree again about your point about it not restricting the world setting.

 but as i have said, i have very little interest in religion so may be completely wrong about what he was getting inspiration from, though my origional point does seem to crop up in most books ive read that study hs works

though once again im not gonna argue this point till the sun sets, otherwise id be condradicting myself!

It's got to be over 10 years since I read the books, so I can't really say I remember any details, but I suspect we'll get some sort of fiery demon type of thing, the classic interpretation or whatever. The Minotaur is of course the classic labyrinth-beast, so at the end of the labyrinth of tunnels etc of Moria, it's only natural to get something horn-tastic and covered in flame. According to wikipedia, the quote there of the Moria Balrog looks "like a great shadow, in the middle of which was a dark form, of man-shape maybe, yet greater". So, um, could be anything really. A dark form in the middle of a shadow? I mean, the card could just be completely black...

Though something dripping in slime could be equally amazing!

I wasn't actually all that fussed on seeing a Balrog in either Khazad-dum or the Dwarrowdelf Cycle, but now I've been thinking on it, I'm really pretty excited!

Haha Rich; I know right? I am quite intrigued actually.  So far, everything you have said on this message board I have agreed with and enjoy reading.  Mainly it is because you come across as a genuinely nice person, and I like talking to sincere and nice people.  As far as philosophy, indeed, I love a good philosophical talk myself.  My favorite three subjects are Religion, Philosophy, and History.  I would love to have such a conversation with you in the future.

 

All right, enough of this way off topic conversation here.  Sorry all you other guys who actually read this post hoping to find an opinion about the Balrog.  Enough of my non-LOTR card game thoughts.  Play on!!!

I'm pretty sure we are going to see the Balrog in Khazad-dum, in addition to in the Dwarrowdelf's 6th pack. Just take a look at the new avatars and you can see one piece of artwork with the shadow of the Balrog in it!

 I've always had an issue with the Balrog.


He's always suffered the same fate as the Dwarves in the Hobbit. When I read the book as a kid, I pictured the Dwarves looking a little more lawn-gnomey. Tolkien didn't help when he kept referring to their colorful cloaks and affinity for musical instruments. Plus, they were kind of a bumbling lot- which made them seem a little more comical than the stout-sturdy dwarves of PJ's films.


The Balrog was the same way. I think the film version looks pretty wicked compared to what I imagined as a kid. (Wings or no wings!)


That was more like what I had in my head, but without those ridiculous wings. There's nowhere to go but up from there! :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Depicting devils/demons as goat-headed or bull-headed predates Christian imagery. It borrows from imagery that is a lot older. Also, you have to base the Balrog's look on _something_. depicting the Balrog as a solid black cloud would be quite underwhelming, don't you think?

I finally got my copy of Khazad-dum in the mail, and it turns out that it's packaged with an advertisement for the Dwarrowdelf Adventure Packs that includes this image [http://tinyurl.com/7r3wtbn].  Here's hoping for The Nameless Fear to make a return in Dwarrowdelf Adventure Pack #6!

I think that the linked image is my absolute favorite art in this game to date, I LOVE it!



 

kinda reminds me of Reaper form the Abyss or Abyssal Persecutor
