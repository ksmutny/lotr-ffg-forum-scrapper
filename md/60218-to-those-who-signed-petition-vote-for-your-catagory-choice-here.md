i thought id keep this seperete from the petition thread to keep it tidyish, so ive been taking player opinions from people who signed it and there seems to be a difference in what people want so to keep everyone happy i guess we gotta vote ;D

so post first ideally how many catagories you would like then the general names/whats to be included of those catagories

 if anyone wants to place votes here who hasnt signed the petition then you are welcome to do so, but please consider signing it as well as the more names the better :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

heres mine

 

5

General discussion inc. news

Rules and FAQ

Tournaments

Decks and deck building

Player made content

 

i cant think of any post that cant find a home in them, and theyre general enough to be obvious whats where,

the problem i had with the proposed catagories was there was nowhere to discuss genereally/debate things ie what makes a good player or what player type are you?

I think your list has covered what I would propose.

 I would remove Rules and FAQ. I think that questions about gameplay need to be in the main forum that gets the most traffic. Otherwise, many people (especially new players with questions) will probably post them in the main forum, anyway.

One potential problem with not having a Rules and FAQ category of its own is that it becomes all the more difficult to find the information you are looking for.  For example, pumpkin started a fantastic thread way back when that has tons of great FAQ content. However, it continually falls off the first page and new players don't realize it's there and just start a new thread. Over time, multiple threads get started to ask and answer similar questions. If there is a sub-category just for Rules and FAQ's, I could see that happening a lot less. Also, searching for an answer that's already been posted would become easier.

Right now, if you search for a key word (for example the name of a given card), the filter will pull up every post where that card name appears, no matter the subject. If you're searching for a Rules question about a certain card, searching in the Rules subcategory will help filter out anything that's not rules related.

For me, at least "news & previews" and "Rules & FAQ" and whatever you want else !

That right there would be ideal, I think. I like combining the tournaments, decks and fan content under "player created."

And I will concede to juicebox's point.

i also agree with grouping player content and having a dedicated rules and faq as i said

so i like the 3 catagories proposed by muemakan, also only having 3 will ensure each one still gets enough traffic through- the thing i love about this fourm is it only has about a 6 hr max time until someone gets back to you-  which is pretty fast -and im part of alot of forums.......

I could get behind this too. I might suggest a slight re-order (just to go from more general/official to more specific/unofficial):

General Topics

Rules & FAQ

Player Created (Tournaments, Decks, Scenarios, etc...)

 

I also like the idea of disbanding the Massing sub-forum. Seems quite random.

unless anyone has any major problems i think we have our cats......

ps how long should we give the petition....i think all the major players have either signed or looked at it.......but i still want to give it a couple more days

Personally, I think it'd be nice to have at least 50 names.

Dare I dream such a dream?

my honest opinion???/ i think we'll be lucky to get 20.....unless we keep bumping it for about a month and hope we get a sudden intake of newcomers.

i know 12 is a bit - very- small, but looking at the names, most of the forums top posters are all there, or have posted on the forums since this started and likely dont want to have part in this.....apart from boored and glaurung, who i havnt seen post for a while

 i guess weve got to leave it up until we get more though. ffg may laugh if we send a petition with 12 names on it :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

just looked at GOT forums - and what d'ya know? subforums........we shouldnt really have to ask for this

My 2 cents:

4 Categories:

1. General

2. Rules and FAQ

3. Strategies (deck, deck-building and session reports)

4. Tournaments

 Although I'm no longer playing CoC anymore and so don't visit the forums, I did like they way FFG set up the categories for that one. In addition to the top level there are the following subforums:

 * Deck Construction
 * General Discussion
 * Off Topic
 * Organized Play (good spot for the fan run tournaments)
 * Rules Discussion
 * Trade forum (not really applicable for LoTR since we've never been collectible)
 * The World of H.P. Lovecraft (replace with Tolkien obviously)

General

Rules/ FAQ

Strategies/ deck construction

Player made content/ tournaments

Would be my vote.

oooohhh the word of tolkien forum sounds nice to me.......gran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif].....however i must (very) regreattably admit that i dont think it would get enough traffic to justify giving its own forum.....though it would be great., so if people arent bothered about having an extra forum....i think id make my home right in that one gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]

while I think this is a great idea...and LOTR:LCG definitely warrants the addition of categories, I don't think we should be disappointed if it doesn't get approved.

I went thru the forum for Board/Card games and there was only one (that i saw) with sub-categories...that was Dust Tactics [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_temas.asp?efid=196&efcid=1]. FFG makes several really good games. For there to be only one set up how we are talking is a little discouraging.

I am not sure what FFG considers when deciding whether categories are needed but, hopefully they find our initiative enough to warrant the time to add the categories.

Not to mention, all of the current discussions would be lost. It would take too long for someone to go back thru and categorize all of the current (and not so current) discussion threads.

Knowing what i know about forum and web programming in general, the only way to categorize discussions when they were created before any categories existed would be to do it one by one. Unless FFG uses some amazing program to allow this transition, I only know of the manual way.

Someone would have to go thru each of the 1593 threads currently existing under the LOTR:LCG category and assign the category that thread should go under.

Why would all the current threads be lost?

The simplest solution would be for everything current to just stay in the "General" category.

An even better solution (though I don't know if this is possible) would be for FFG to give the authority to the person who originally posted a thread (yes, all 1593 of them) to move the thread to a different forum. Even if this feature was enabled for a window of time (like 1 week), those of us still active on the forums could switch the threads over to the new category that we care about the most.

If that second option can't happen, it would still be possible to create new posts in the new sub-forums with links to the "old thread" for those who wish to read the backstory. For example, with pumpkin's FAQ thread, pumpkin could cut and past all of the already compiled content in the first post of that original thread to a new post in the new Rules & FAQ category with a link at the bottom that takes readers back to the old thread for reference. I would do something similar for my key juicebox Tournament threads. Sure, it's not the most elegant solution, but there's no reason any threads should have to be lost.

I have been thru this several times in my own experience. You are asked what to do with current threads when you start adding categories. You either delete them and start fresh, or you assign them ALL to a single category.

Forums are not intuitive.....if categories are created AFTER 1593 threads are created, your are right, they go to a default category (typically General). That is the only thing that is automatic.

If each person who posted a thread wanted to go back thru and link their old thread, feel free. If FFG wants to give one of us who signed the petition the task of going back thru and moving the threads, that is fine too. But short of writing code to search each thread for language that might indicate what category it has to be assigned to, it has to be done manually by someone with admin rights.

Key is making the choice of a forum in which to post a "no-brainer". 

"Decks and deck-building" seems redundant.  Also, it's not clear where card-specific strategies would be discussed.  Therefore, I like the idea of using "Strategy and deck building" instead of "Decks and deck building".

So we could have:

- General discussion
- Rules and FAQ
- Tournaments
- Strategy and deck building
- Player made content

This sounds good to me too. I do kind of like separating out "Tournaments" from other "Player Made Content," though I can understand those who want fewer categories and would therefore wish to combine them.

 Eh, I guess if we're talking 4-5 categories, anyway, then it would be better to split that to keep Tournaments separate.
