There's an add on the back of Game Trade Magazine #138 for the Dead Marshes and it shows Boromir as a Tactics Hero.

Here's is stats if they haven't been spoiled already

 

Boromir - Tactics

THREAT - 11

WP - 1

ATTK - 3

DEF - 2

HP - 5

Action - Raise your threat by 1 to ready Boromir

Action - Discard Boromir to deal 2 damage to each enemy engaged with a single player.

 

 

The add also shows a Spirit Ally that appears to be an "Elfhelm..." something or another (blocked by Boromir's card.)

Cost - 4

WP - 1

ATTK - 2

DEF - 2

HP - 3

Response that has something to do with questing units and quest card effects (most of text is blocked).

 

 

A treachery card called "Through the Mist" with a When Revealed effect that calls for an "escape test" and looks like it might force discards or raise threat of a failed test (most of text is blocked by the "Elfhelm...")  Also has the text "Escape 3" that somehow related to the "escape test?"

 

A neutral attachement called Song of Battle.  Not text visible but sure its like Song of Kings for Tactics.

 

FYI,

 

Wraith428.

Haha, that were exactly the stats I expected for boromir^^ I guess with his ability he merges good with spirit (threat reducion and fortune or fate)

Thanks for sharing!

Excellent. Justice to the character I say. I have expected the stats as well. Was perhaps thinking for a defense bonus strength as an ability but For Gondor! will already make Boromir even more great.

The Spirit Tactics combination has been most pronounced from the start I believe, and this really strengthen that trend. Close to the end of the game, Boromir's abilities may be priceless. The thereat ready action can really save you a game at the start as well. And I am really looking forward to including him in my deck. How about Boromir, Eleanor, Imrahil as a Gondor squad?

 So with "For Gondor" in play, Boromir can block an attack with a nice three defense, ready by increasing threat, and then attack with a four attack?

That's pretty wicked. Or does "For Gondor" only work for a Phase?

 

Now I'm trying to think of ways to make a solid deck that includes Boromir, Denethor, and Faramir.....Probably need "Song of Kings" to get in some Leadership icons...

 For Gondor works for a phase, but that phase includes all players' defense and all players' attacks.

Just pair them with Aragorn. Get a steward of Gondor plus a Song of Lore and a Song of Battle on him and you're sittin' pretty.

And PS I'm working on the picture of Boromir. My FLGS is going to take a picture of the back cover for me tomorrow.

I was hoping for more of an action pose but that's ok

That's uh... definitely not what I was expecting.  I suppose I was envisioning his card looking much more like the artwork for Faramir, ya know, with a weapon drawn.  That picture kinda gives the impression that he might be walking around bashing orcs with the horn.

That's not a horn, that is a beer tankard. His face expression signals: "I want more beer else I'm getting angry and start a fight" :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Thanks Narsil for providing the pic though!

Boromir Beer Fest, coming to Isengard AD (or CE) 2011.

Yeah, nice, still waiting for a clearer take though. It is also one of mine favourite characters from the books and I am very glad it is getting so powerful. Thematically, I find it very fitting. Boromir is known to be one of the strogest warriors of his time but the ability can get tricky, use it too much and you may get in trouble. The discard ability is extreme but if the game only requires some hits to complete (like Carrock for instance) it may be a winner, too.

I love that Boromir is getting his own hero card, but I'm not loving the artwork all that much.

I was expecting more of a battle-crazed look with his shield out while he's fighting off a bunch of baddies; he just looks like he's ready for happy hour, or lost.

Good card though. Might entice me to try and make a Gondor deck.

Faramir and Boromir back to back...just like the movies!...wait.
