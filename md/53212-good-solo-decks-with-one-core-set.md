 Any of you guys out there have some good decks out there that can beat some of these quests solo?  I keep looking for 50+ card solo decks, but all the ones I find seem to require two core sets.  I have all the adventure packs, so have access to more than just the core, so they can even have those cards, but I can't do something like play with 3 Northern Trackers or anything.  I have only played the game solo with mono decks and haven't been able to do well against even Mirkwood, though I've beat it as much as I've lost it.  I did play with a friend using two mono decks and we beat Mirkwood fine.  I'm just not a skilled deck builder and was hoping this game would have been more friendly with just pulling out a sphere and doing well against the three quests, but haven't had any luck with that, so time to call on the community to do the work I am too lazy to do. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

I think this is what I used to beat Journey Along the Anduin for the first time solo. It was born out of my frustration and I just grabbed every card I thought would be the most useful out of all four spheres. It's been a while and I've learned a lot since then so I'd probably tweak it but you could use this as a base and tweak it the way you want.

I don't think anyone has come up with a solo deck that will beat everything. It just takes different strats for different quests so some decks do well on some quests and then get slapped around on others.

I'm still trying to build a solo deck for Rhosgobel. Struck out 4 times so far I think. So many nasty damage dealing treachery cards. Damage to exhausted characters, damage to characters without attachments, damage to wounded characters. Rivers are running red with blood.

 Hey fellow Ringer! Before all the expansions started releasing I used a Fellowship with Beravor, Gloin, and Eowyn. Mix in all the best cards from those spheres and you should be able to win against anduin and mirkwood. I only own one core set and cannot for the life of me convince myself to purchase another one for a few cards. I must confess, after using all the expansions to explore new deck possibilities, I am shocked that I have not been able to come up with a better solo deck than the one I built with just the Core starter. Good luck and happy gaming!!!
