That was random.

Of all the people who would post or even say something humorous, Seastan was to me the least likely.

Pretty good. I feel like a more accurate punchline would have been for the player on the right to point out that the Witch King is immune to player card effects and that the other guy needed to walk back his entire turn :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

well i guess it depends on the quest and/or which side is face up.  they could be playing massing at osgiliath, or he could be sorcerer side up in Pelennor fields

That's actually what I was expecting to happen as well.

He is inmune at that point.

Also, what happened to the angry penguin?

ah good call.  i suppose this video only works if they're playing Massing at Osgiliath then

Given that he says it's not a victory point card, that is indeed the only option.

But the Osgiliath version of the Witch-King has the text: "While The Witch-king is in the staging area, each character gets -1 Willpower." and in the video Faramir is getting +2 attack for Herugrim. This is clearly a made up version of the Witch King!

Maybe he had a Dunedian Message attached from earlier?

Judging by the efficiency of the rest of the combos he is using I would bet Faramir is getting that +1 wp from having Song of Travel and Asfaloth attached with an Elfhelm hero at the table.

I believe this thread has confirmed that we all belong in this video :-)
