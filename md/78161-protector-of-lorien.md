If I have attached a copy of this card to two or more heroes, when I discard a card will all the heroes with the card attached get +1 willpower?

No.  When you trigger an ability on a copy of PoL, you discard a card as the cost.  You cannot discard a card as to paying the cost of two (or more) copies of PoL.
