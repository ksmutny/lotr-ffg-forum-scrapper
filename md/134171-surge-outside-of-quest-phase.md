Hi Guys,

so me and my playgroup have a hard time beating "To Catch an Orc" with 3 or more players. One of the main reason is that sooooo many cards in this encounter deck have the keyword "surge". This is especially painfull, when you loose your timecounters in stage two (which we try really hard to aviod but you know it happens sometimes) and have to reveal two cards per player. At this point we have a rule question. Surge ist descriced in the rulebook like that:

 

Surge:
 
When an encounter card with the surge keyword is
revealed during the staging step of the quest phase or in
setup, reveal 1 additional card from the encounter deck.
Resolve the surge keyword immediately after resolving

any when revealed effects on the card.

 

I have highlighted the important section of this describtion. If you loose your last time counter at the end of a round, you're neither in the quest phase nor in setup. So let's say we are 3 players and have to reveal 6 cards, do we have to "surge" if we draw a card with that keyword or can we ignore it?

That's the old definition of surge from the core set.

Surge happen whenever the phase.

 

This cycle, playing with more than 2 people was just crazy. We had a group of 4 people, been 2 month since we didn't want another try at those quests!

That would be in the FAQ :

> (1.01) Encounter Keywords
> Surge, Doomed, and Guarded keywords should be
> resolved any time the card on which they occur is
> revealed from the encounter deck, including during
> setup.

Surge is not work if the card was not reveal. For example add to the staging area effect will not trigger surge effect.
