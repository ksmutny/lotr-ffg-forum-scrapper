 During setup, it says to the first player should attach Cave Torch to a hero.  What is Cave Torch?  The pack that I have doesn't contain anything called Cave Torch.  Am I missing a card?  What number is it?

i think i see the problem here- have you bought a dwarrowdelf pack WITHOUT the khazad dum deluxe expansion?? if so you need that pack first as the torch is in it

Ah!  Yes, I do have that - bought it at the same time as this pack and a few others - I just hadn't opened that yet.  Thanks!
