I know a lot of us here probably like card games and board games precisely because they are NOT computer games, and i am one of those people too, but i was just wondering what you'd think about LotR being released as an app (on the iPad, for example)

I cant see FFG ever doing it, but i cant help thinking that this game would be perfect on a little tablet. It doesn't even have to be the game... Maybe just a deck builder. Sometimes you are just too lazy to get all the cards out and sort through them, and it would be nice just to have all the cards on your ipad as an easy way to look through them in a moment of boredom. And you could save all your decks on it... Maybe it could have all the rules and erratas too. It could be well handy. And if it was just a deck builder it wouldn't dent their sales, because you'd still need to buy the cards to play the game.

I seem to remember one guy on here made his own app (inadvisedly!) and quickly had it taken down by FFG, so maybe there is a small possibility of FFG doing their own in the future.

But anyway... I was just wondering what you think. I like having the physical cards myself, and its nice to get away from the computer screen, so I'm not fussed.

No. I don't think they ever will.

Tales of the cards has a pretty extensive article on using the app "card warden" to play the game via iPad that I would suggest checking out

That being said I don't think we'll see an official app although given the rabid success of hearthstone I think progressive

thinking companies would be wise to consider it

I do not.

 

It seems Fantasy Flight is focused on making [really good] games and that's about it. They have no web app for registering events or anything like that, so an app for card games seems either a long ways way or never.

Hearthstone is made by a company that specializes in computer games though.

FFG are set up to deal with physical components - additionally as this game is essentially solitaire (or can be) they would probably lose money on translating this into an online format as many people would then not need to buy all the cards.

I guess it depends on if they think the broader audience would get them more sales. Several other board games have cropped up on steam recently (like small world and ticket to ride) maybe all games will eventually go that way.

I would really love a deck builder app and I think there might be a chance we could see that some day. 

At GenCon last year FFG announced that they would be taking over CardgameDB at a certain point which will lead to officially sanctioned card lists and hopefully a deck builder. It would be a small step from there to an app. They already have support apps like that for Star Wars games.

There are 2 apps.

 

OCTGN and LackeyCCG. Both have deck builders, both have online play. OCTGN is PC only (though apparently if you're a tech head you can get it working in wine on Mac and PC, but I do not know anyone that has been able to get it to work). LackeyCCG can play on Mac, PC, Linux and the iPad version is in its final RC releases and should be out any time now, just waiting on Apple approval basically.. and an Android version is in the works. The lackyCCG plugin is not kept uptodate as often as OCTGN. 

 

Personally LackeyCCG is by FAR the better app to play the game in, it has save and load, crash protecting, built in functionality to play multihanded and more.. OCTGN has none of those options.

 

LackeyCCG







 

OCTGN







 

There is ALSO a extremely advanced deck builder. You can see it in action in the 1st video (LackeyCCG one). Zorbec makes it and a CoC one.. it is the best deck builder I have ever used among all the games I have ever  played. Have a play with it.. seriously phenomenal. 

 

It can export decks to Lackey, OCTGN and forum posts.  Has statistical information, testing section, filters and card sorting and even effect filters. (like show only cards that draw more cards) etc etc.

 

Get it here Zorbe'c Deck Builders [http://eric.minet.free.fr/index_en.htm]

 

It runs only on PC, but with wine I can get it to run easily in Mac and Linux.

I don't think so.

 

Especially Deckbuilder are enough around. They are browser based, so you can use them on iPad to.

it could be a decent money spinner for them. I don't think there are many people in the world who like "in-app purchases", but they would be a perfect fit for this.

every time a new pack came out they could just charge 50p or something, to add the cards to your deck builder. so they'd have two ways of making money from each pack — adding them to your deck builder app, and buying the actual cards so you can play the game.

it all comes down to money at the end of the day, doesn't it. if they can see they will make money off it then maybe they will do it.

 

they could have a better quest log on there too.

 

the more i think about it, the better i'm thinking it would be. come on FFG!

i totally forgot that they bought CardGameDB. that puts my hopes up that we will eventually see something one day

I would totally enjoy a thing like that. Being able to play with mah far friends and stuff, or matchmade with randoms. Dragging in someone who would never spend a cent on a real life card collection.

did IQs just drop sharply. You CAN do that. Play online, play on ipad and have match making and everything. This already exists..

While OCTGN is good, it's not automated and requires plenty of setup and digging, has no fancy effects and stuff. For me, LotR LCG fan, owning entire physical collection, it does not matter. For someone new, alien to the card games, lotr lcg, or else, OCTGN might prove to be pretty hard and uninviting. 

 

An automated game which resolves all automatic effects, has graphics (splashes during damage) and visual parameter changes (like reducing actual printed vaule on the card if it's got -1 willpower or else) would be what it takes to drag outside people in.

Hasnt the Lackey ipad app been "waiting for approval" for over a year now? I know apple can be slow but ****.

Boored:

We're talking about apps which implies the ability to use it on iOS and Macs which you can't do with Lackey or OCTGN.
Also, there's something nice about an officially sponsored program that has cool art and a less complicated installation/interface.

Dont you have to wait 6 months or something, for all the new quests to appear on OCTGN?

It would be much better to have a deck builder app by FFG which you could use as the quests come out

CardGameDB is a great site, but its not quite as good as you would get with a dedicated app

If you have sets yourself, you can insert your own images into the OCTGN, granting you instant access.

Lackey is a native Mac application. It runs on mac. It also runs on iPad and it also runs on PC

Warmachine, hordes, and warhammer all have companion apps. There would be 0% loss in sales if they distributed a companion app with quest logs, faqs, rules errata and a deck builder. I don't know why they haven't. I already have this forum, a few card search sites bookmarked and I have a notepad for a makeshift quest log. All of this things in one place with official support would be amazing.

An actual digital version of the game I'm going to say a short no to. Just doesn't seem likely. Which is unfortunate, because it could be really fun.

Just want to let you know the iPad version of LackeyCCG is 100% done. The apple approval process is a very arduous one and Trevor (the developer) has had a child and moved house and more.. so a lot of life stuff has delayed it. I expect it should be out soon, though I have been saying that for a long time now! hehe

Just a side note, I do not update the LackeyCCG plugin as often as I probably should. It will always get updates form me but if your looking for near Zero Day updates then the boy doing the OCTGN plugin are your guys. On the plus side it is very easy to update lackeyCCG yourself if you can not wait.

Also OCTGN has a "proxy" system, while lackeyCCG uses a censored card system. This means that even if you do not have the card images, you can play on OCTGN, but in LackeyCCG the most recent packs will be blurred. This is as FFG is only semi tolerant to these digital versions, and asks us to only release cards 6 months after the real cards have been published.

As for FFG making their own app? I think it is only a matter of time. They recently bought CardGameDB and though they reversed the decision they removed export for OCTGN form that site as part of a process to remove the digital versions. This was stopped at FFG, but the general rumor (and that is all it is) was that this was part of their process to pave the way for a official application.

On a personal note I think they are crazy to no make a digital app. It seams like money for nothing. Developing a video game version is just a logistics problem, the game, the art.. everything is done. Also the LCG pack format is a very comfortable and recognized idea in computer gaming circles.. they call it DLC. To be honest I find it incredible they haven't already started doing this.

Is there any kind of legal constraint regarding using art for a digital version? Legal issues often stop good ideas in their tracks.

If me buying the app and rebuying the 'DLC' packs of adventure cards gave FFG more money and made them notice that LOTR LCG was heaps popular I would.

I think its a total no-brainer too. These packs aren't always easy to get hold of (especially the nightmare decks), but if they appeared on the app every month then i would basically buy them straight away (i am a sucker for that). If it was just a deck builder then the whole thing would act as one big advert for buying the cards. It's a money spinner.

Having a playable game would be great, but I would be happy with just these:

Deck builder

Up-to-date rules with erratas

Quest log

And maybe some previews too, that would be a bonus
