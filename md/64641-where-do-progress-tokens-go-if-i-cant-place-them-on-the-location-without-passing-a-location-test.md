 So, I am playing The Long Dark for the first time and I am unsure of what to do with a particular card.  Twisting Passage: Threat-3, Progress-5, Underground. Dark. Forced: Before placing progress tokens on Twisting Passage, the first player must make a locate test. If this test is failed, do not place any progress tokens on Twisting Passage and trigger all "Lost:" effects in play.

So, what happens if I quest while Twisting Passage is the active location and I win the quest by a lot of progress, but I fail the Location Test?  If the location can't "accept" progress tokens for that turn, what happens to the remaining progress tokens that I have won by?  Are they automatically placed on the major quest card by default?  Or, are they assumed to not be placed anywhere because they could not legally be placed on the buffering location that turn?  

Thanks for your thoughts!

You cannot put tokens on the quest card cose there is a active location. If you fail the test you cannot put tokens on active location.So no tokens no progress. You just lost in this location and cannot find way out. Is pretty cool in my opinion.So tokens just burnout.

Please tell me is really difficult one??? I heard difficult level 7 so i love it but just need to know more about quest…… And what about encounter and quest cards?

I agree with Glaurung on this one. The progress tokens would be lost (well, you can still place them on one of your heroes so they remind you of your epic failure during the whole game).

 Glaurung: so far I find this to be a difficult one, but we seem to have different opinions on what "difficult" means when it comes to this game so far! ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] Thanks for the input guys, I feared it was so.
