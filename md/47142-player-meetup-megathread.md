# [Player Meetup Megathread](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47142-player-meetup-megathread/)

## 1 [TheLightdarker on May 21, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47142-player-meetup-megathread/?do=findComment&comment=472351)

Having recently tried (and failed) to find any local players via FFG's "Friends Finder," and inspired by other players' threads cropping up from time to time asking if anyone lives near them, I figured it might be useful to instead create and use one condensed thread where interested people can simply announce their geographic location, and others can skim through to see if anyone lives near them to meet up for some LotR:tCG or whatever.  Each post can be as simple as my own information below:

Yakima, Washington, United States

So, where are you guys at?  Feel free to post your info in this thread, and I'll add it to the post below.

After some geography Googling, I'm still a little confused.  Is Javier España your name?  What city/province in Argentina do you live in?  If you don't mind sharing, that is.

Glaurung i My nick for all the time.  You dont know who is it????  Glaurung i the great dragon. First dragon of Melkor.

You never read Silmarilion????

Not to keep derailing my own thread, but I find it very interesting that Amazon.com keeps pushing their "in stock" date back.  It was originally the 20th, but quickly became the 22nd, 24th, and now sits at the 27th.  I wish there was a way of knowing just how many Core sets and expansion packs FFG has sold for this product line, I'd be very interested to know.

I guess we don't know how many sets they order to begin with. Maybe only a handful?

EIther way, did you get your HFG Lightdarker? Thoughts?

 @ lightdarker, can you move the thread to the new sub forum. that would be great. thanks

## 163 [radiskull on February 22, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47142-player-meetup-megathread/?do=findComment&comment=597437)

I'm pretty sure individual users aren't able to do it, but perhaps sending a request to the moderators would do it.

I know, I know. I meant he should open a new thread and copy the list into the new one. Like juicebox moved his tournament thread.

I think for this particular kind of thread, this is a very good solution.

Lightdarker, how do you feel about it? This is an excellent thread that you started and have been updating for the community. Thank you! Are you wanting to continue? If so, cutting and pasting to the subforum seems like a great solution. No reason this thread should get buried. In fact, if a request goes to a Mod, I would hope for it to be for the new iteration of this thread to be sticked in the appropriate subforum. That would be a gift to us all.

Oh, and I'm in Seattle, Washington, USA. gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]

 @Juicebox: I've finally overcome my laziness and recreated a new thread here [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=286&efcid=4&efidt=620628], which I should be updating very regularly.

To everyone else, if you would let this thread die, it'll be much easier to just check the "Player Community" subforum's megathread to stay updated with as much new information as possible. Thanks!

 If you don't mind visiting Slovakia, you can come over to Piešťany (~90 kms North from Bratislava) and we can play till our eyes bleed. Sleeping over is no problem, since I live on my own. Or I may visit you sometimes.
