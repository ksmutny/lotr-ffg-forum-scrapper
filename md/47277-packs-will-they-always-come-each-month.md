this is my first ffg game, so i have to ask, given the fact of monthly adventure packs, will this continue into the far future?

 

i assume that ffg has kept this up with other games, but do you think that after interest has died down for the game, that the packs will stop sorpresa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sorpresa.gif]

It's my first LCG too, but looking at the other games they've been going for quite a few cycles and expansions now.

Every game is always going to be driven by interest, otherwise they won't make a profit.  However, they've stated that Lord Of The Rings LCG Core Set has been their most succesful game to date, so that bodes well for the future.

All of the LCG's get packs each month, barring any production issues of course. Each cycle is 1 expansion over 6 months. With the occasional deluxe expansions as well thrown into the mix.

Yes, you can expect to see packs regularly each month :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] I'm really looking forward to the first. They've mentioned they have them planned out beyond the first cycle, and they've already been giving tidbits of preview for several of the packs past the first.
