# [Hero and Supporting Player Cards](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/305367-hero-and-supporting-player-cards/)

I've noticed in some packs that there are usually some player cards included in the pack that seem to go hand in hand with the hero in the pack. There are some obvious ones like Radagast and his staff, but then there are some subtle ones like Loragorn and Rivendell Bow. In the most recent packs, going all the way back to the Withered Heath, this pattern has continued. In reverse chronological order:

Saruman + staff

Lotheriel + horn

Thorin + axe

Frodo + ring

Radagast + staff

Tilbo + sting

Dain + ring

Thranduil + elven king

Haldan + woodman's path (a bit of a stretch)

(You could argue Grimbeorn got some Beorning support)

I know this is probably intentional, but it does make you wonder with the probable thought that our last three Heroes are Gildor, Wilyador, and Sparagorn, what do you think the supporting cards will be for those heroes? I assume Sparagorn is getting Anduil / King title, Wilyador will no doubt have the "no restricted attachments" wording, so maybe a bonkers event, but I am not sure how to best support Gildor.

Maybe something that functions like elven light -- i.e. an attachment that says "when attached hero spends at least one resource to trigger an effect, exhaust *this* to place one resource in attached hero's pool"? That makes playing with Gildor a lot more appealing and would fit as there is one leadership card yet unspoiled from the fourth pack (one tactics and one neutral as well).

I just wanted ya'alls take on that, given the remaining packs

I'm honestly really hoping that Wilyador is an ally, not a hero. I really don't think an eagle hero fits in the game well.  I feel that their current presence as a tribe that focuses on temporary bonuses and effects fits much better with their eucatastrophic nature in the setting. I actually hope we see another tactics rohan hero, to help their viability.

That said, I'm hoping for anduril with spirit Aragorn, which seems like a safe bet.

For Gildor, I'm actually hoping for a card exactly like what you described. It would be a strong card for Gildor, the twins, and even might help rehabilitate Lorefindel.

I actually hoped for the exact same thing, an attachment the benefits the hero who spent a resource. However, the attachment would have to be specific to Noldor I think, especially if it gave a resource because it would seem a little unfair if you could put an attachment like that on Grimbeorn who could trigger his ability and just get that resource back. That would be too powerful.

Well I went ahead and looked at eligible heroes, and Gildor, Lorefindel and the twins would be the only ones who would qualify. I actually don't think the Grimbeorn combo would be broken, per se. You still have to hold the original resource during the planning phase and while he does get the resource back, he is not ready by this attachment. He would need something else in order to trigger it again. Likewise, leadership Aragorn and Gimli benefit from this attachment but not in a broken way (just readying) Balin would finally get a little love. Frodo and Eomer would be a lot stronger. 

Honestly, the one that might break is Na'asiyah.

As long as the attachment benefiting spending a resource exhausts to do so, I don't think it's game-breaking with either Grimbeorn or Na'asiyah.

I think that spending a resource bonus is great, what I would also consider is:

 

Immortality

Cost 1

Attach to a Noldor or Silvan hero.

After attached hero spends a resource from its resource pool to trigger an action or response effect, exhaust this card to ready attached hero.

 

As for the hoped for Eagle hero I actually hope it's Gwahir and we get Wilyador as an ally. Then Gwahir could have:

 

Golden Crown: 

Cost 2

Attach to an Eagle hero. Exhaust Golden Crown to return an eagle character from your discard pile and either take it into your hand or put it into play for no cost.

 

As for Aragorn, what is more fitting than his sword Anduril and what I would do for that one is:

 

Anduril

Cost 4 

Guarded (enemy or location)

Attach to a Noble Hero

Restricted

Attached hero gets +1 Willpower, +1 Attack, +1 Defense and +1 Hit Point for each different resource icon he has.

Reduce the cost to play this card by 1 for each different resource icon you have on a hero you control.

The suggested Immortality effect makes the card worthless for Elladan/Elrohir, so the target audience shrinks to Gildor or Lorfindel.

Is suggested Golden Crown missing some text?  I'm not sure why you'd want your eagle in hand when you can put it into play for no cost.  It'd make Arwen and SpEowyn *very* popular in an eagles deck.

Anduril's guarded cost seems very high, it's counterintuitive to me that it becomes cheaper as it becomes more useful.

A little too expensive I would think. For essentially a base 3 cost (free in quad sphere) you would still have to guard it. Sting is a better option, as it is free for a hobbit hero (as opposed to noble), essentially has the same stat line boost out the gate and also has a nice trigger for attack/defense. 

I see what you are going for, though. It's a solid idea and I think they might do something like that anyway. I just think the cost is way too much upfront.

Also, would Saruman/Gandalf get a momentary +4 boost if you could finagle the noble stat on them and then trigger their ability?

Remember that so far all the latest cycles have had at least 1 ffg created hero, so Wilyador actually fits the bill, though I kinda agree with General Grievous with wanting a Gwahir hero.

 

I do think if they make an attachment for Gildor it should be specific to Noldor or Silvan... And if the  attachment exhausted to grant a resource that would be nice on Gildor, the twins, and especially Glorifindel because for such a powerful character Lorefindel has such an underwhelming ability. It would be great if they could help make an old core set hero good again.

How about, similar to Rivendell Bow, we have "noldor, silvan or Aragorn"? I'd love both Coragorn and Lorefindel to get some love

## 11 [General_Grievous on February 5, 2020](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/305367-hero-and-supporting-player-cards/?do=findComment&comment=3886968)

Definitely could drop the cost of Anduril to 1 as it's enough of a battle to get all of the different spheres on one hero via songs or Aragorn's toys. 

And Dale the Crown gives you options, maybe you want to save an eagle for next round if it's super cheap to play anyways or you are on a quest that is about to wipe out all your allies. Either way I am feeling Gwahir as a hero and then Wilyador being one of his available allies to round out then eagle trait. But either way an Eagle is along-requested option and favourite.
