Hey everyone,

 

I just wanted to make a quick topic asking for your support on my newly (well three or four month old by now) created LotR LCG blog, Down the Anduin.  I just made a Facebook page for it and would really appreciate it if you gave it a like.  This community is one of the best I've seen anywhere on the internet for any... thing, really.  So I'd really like to further that communication and interaction with everyone as I publish ideas and play experience posts.     

 

 

This link [https://www.facebook.com/pages/Down-the-Anduin/616772905043993] will take you to my Facebook page and the blog itself can be found in my signature below. 

 

 

Thanks for your time!

just a thought.. why not contact a existing blog and ask for contributor status?

 

If all these random bloggers got on the same page it would be a very good site...instead of them all getting abandoned after a year or so.

Well I'm going to try my best not to abandon my blog and with the wealth of new content arriving this year, it will surely help keep up the motivation to create new posts.

Awesome blog. PS not sure what's wrong with your commenting sections but I've tried to post two comments on the nightmare blog but they don't work

I don't know if you can, but you should really enable an RSS feed.

Thanks for the feedback.  I'm not sure why the comments are not working for you, Spurries; I checked them and they seem to be alright for me still.  And, I'll be quite honest, since I'm new to blogging I'm not entirely sure what an RSS feed is, but I will look into it.

According to a result from a Google search:

 

"In Blogger go into your Settings, then choose Site Feed. In the pulldown to the right of Allow Blog Feeds, choose full or short. That's it."

 

RSS feeds allow other sites to know when you have updated you site with a new post, and also allows them to read your content without actually being on your site. I want it for a feed aggregator, which pulls all the content from all the blogs I follow into one place so I know when there are new articles and can read them without needing to go to each of the sites.

Thanks!  I toggled that setting to select for a full RSS feed of my site.  I'm definitely going to look more into these now because they sound quite handy indeed.
