Hello,

Sorry for my englishe!

My question is this:

 

If you commit all your charaters to the quest ( ally's and hero's ) how do the enemy's who you are engaged with deal there damage?

If there are two enemy's engaged with you do they put there damage to one hero/ally?  

And does the protectcost of the shield count when character's are damaged when they are exhaustad (commited to the quest)

 

I hope i did explain my question understandble !!

hope to hear what i must do in this situation

Thanks already

 If there is no one to defend ( all are exhausted) then the attack is undefended and the damage from such an attack
 must be dealt to a single hero you control. It cannot go to an ally. You must assign the damage from each undefended attack that way. 

Defense ( the shield icon) only applies when defending against an attack, not when damage is dealt.

 Good luck :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] and if you get stuck/frustrated check out the thread "I'm done" :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] it "deals" with those kind of feelings.

For clarification's sake: if you have two enemies that will deal damage from undefended attacks, you resolve the attacks independently, so the damage from one attack can go on one hero while damage from the second attack goes on a different hero. The total damage does not (and in some cases cannot) be applied to a single hero.

For instance, if you took two undefended attacks for 4 damage and 5 damage respectively, you can't apply all of that damage to Eleanor because she will be dead after the first attack.
