Forest Flies from NM PtM says, Forced: after you engage this enemy, deal 1 dmg to each exhausted character. Considering I am playing Samwise, would his response trigger before the forced effect of the Flies? (Which also shares the "after you engage" text).

Forced effects trigger before player activated responses... sorry! Â Sam will have to take damage.
