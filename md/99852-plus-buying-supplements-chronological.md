 I started playing LOTR LCG from the beginning (as soon as this game came out in my country), and I buying  each AP systematically as soon as they appeared, eagerly watching for the next. 

 

Now, when I looking back, I can see how long and how a far road,  travel my team. This gives the feeling as if he took part in a great adventure (as in RPG). This is a plus buying AP in chronological order.

 

Every time as released a new AP, the pool of cards players increases, giving a feeling like heroes gained experience, they became stronger and gained new allies. At the same time, each scenario is pushing the storyline forward, even the threat of Sauron grows, it is more noticeable. And also the scenarios become more epic - from simple delivery of the message to Lady Galadriel, to the battle of Osgiliath. From the Mirkwood we wandered up to the very gates of Minas Morgul.

 

So now, looking back I can say that my team has come a long way, surviving many adventures, gained a lot of experience and allies, but even though that is stronger, more experienced, this is not the end of the road, yet much more dangerous adventures ahead of us, and a long way before us. Soon we will move to Isengard.

 

So it is for me plus,  buying expansions chronologically. And that feeling of waiting for the next - what else awaits us on our way. Where to take us this time fate.

So would you say it was worth it playing the watcher in the water just before the Khazad dum deluxe??

that would be out of order....

Core Set and each Deluxe Expansion (Khazad-Dum, Heirs Of Numenor, The Voice Of Isengard) contains three scenarios. For each cycle (Shadows Of Mirkwood, Dwarrowdelf, Against The Shadow and The Ring-maker) is composed with 6 Adventure Packs - Each Adventure Pack includes one scenario.

## 7 [booored on February 23, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99852-plus-buying-supplements-chronological/?do=findComment&comment=993232)

Playing it in order dose nothing for the game experience.

 

Still, there has always been a "light" story in any cycle, but that has been beefed up in the shadow cycle and probably will continue in that vain. Still Khaz is stand alone, so are the Core quests. Mirkwood and Darrowdelf do have a loose order making a story.. but it is not as strong as recent packs.

 

So while I personally think playing it in order is unimportant, if you are a "deep story" kind of guy I would at least play each section in order. Though witch section you start makes zero difference as the stories are self contained and do not spill over.

 

BTW, the release order is posted on the product page. The cycles are listed bottom to top, in order and each pack is in order form top to bottom when you click on them,. deluxe packs are also in order and all come out before the associated cycle. PoDs come out in order after each cycle.

 

So in the provided list add a PoD between the end of each cycle and the deluxe. Hobbit 1/2 is after Darrowdelf and Black Riders is after HoN.... again Saga packs are shown in order...

 

Delux

Cycle

PoD

Saga

 

seams to be the pattern.

Each deluxe expansion is a prelude to the next cycle. 

 

Core Set  -> Shadows Of Mirkwood Cycle.
Khazad-Dum Deluxe Expansion  -> Dwarrowdelf Cycle.
Heirs Of Numenor Deluxe Expansion  ->  Against The Shadow Cycle.
The Voice Of Isengard Deluxe Expansion -> The Ring-maker Cycle.
 
Besides, each cycle using the Encounter decks, which includes Deluxe Expansion. So, without Khazad-Dum, will not play in The Watcher In The Water or some other AP in this cycle - because you will not have Encounter decks that need this AP, which can be found in Khazad-Dum.

isn't that just what I said?

Some players buy AP for the card player -  Return to Mirkwood for Dain Ironfoot. Ok if you want to make decks for the dwarves can buy the AP in which cards are good for them. But you make a good deck for only one race and you will have a random scenarios of the cycle. 

And buying AP chronologically begin with the easier scenarios, and your deck becomes stronger with the AP on the AP.
