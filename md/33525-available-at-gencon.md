Is there any chance that this is going to be available to purchase at Gencon??

Probably not,but i figure it does not hurt to ask.

Not likely, its slated for release this fall. I am sure there will be some preview copies and maybe even demos there. Now I really wish I was going.

I know in years past FFG has had their new LCG games available at Gen Con, but not regular release until the fall. So it is possible that copies could be at Gen Con, and I would be really surprised if there weren't sample and/or demo copies to show off to prospective players.

Here's hoping, and at least we don't have to wait long to find out.

Hope those doesn't have the size problems that WH:I GenCon sets had.
