Hey everyone,

I followed Ninjadorgs example and used his psd files (thanks ^^) to make my own scenario. It is not perfect and I think needs lots of testing, but maybe someone is up to the task ^^

You can find it here on my new blog: http://www.3auglein3.de [http://www.3auglein3.de]

The scenario is in english and german. I hope, you can give me lots of feedback. happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]

 The Orc Forest Camp location is a really nice way to mechanically represent a bad guy hideout. Looks pretty cool!

Very nice indeed.  I look forward to playing this scenario.aplauso.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/aplauso.gif]

seconded, looks really cool :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

Could you add backsides for the cards to the file with Elrond's Message and the Orc Camp?

This look really neat with some clever ideas..

 

A few minor points that need clarifying.

 

1. You have the adding of a token to the Orc Camp as a response, which makes it optional. I don't think your intention was for this to be optional so it should have the keyword forced.

2. Elrond's Message has the keyword guarded 2, but there is no indication what the 2 stands for, that I can see. Is this an error in formatting?

3. I'm a bit confused about what you are intending for the Orcs on card 2b. They stay in the staging area (i.e. won't engage players with high threat) unless they have Elrond's message? Is this a bit reversed to what you had intended? Orcs engage unless they are guarded Elrond's message, perhaps?

I really like the Orc Camp idea though, and i think those nets could prove particularly troublesome, especially with more players. As they can only remove one net per turn max (due to travelling) and they add one per player, that's a net increase (if you'll excuse the pun!) of player-1 per turn.

They will get murdered by threat unless they deal with US quickly - i like it!

Thanks for the feedback so far, its really nice to see the interest ^^

I will add backsides for the cards, good idea, doom. And for pumpkin:

1. You mean, it should read "Forced" instead of "Response"? Yeah, I think, you're right.

2. No error. Guarded 2 just means, its guarded by two cards ^^ But I don't know if this makes it too difficult.

3. The intending is, that the heroes have to hide. To put this into mechanics, means that they cannot fight orcs, but more and more orcs are swarming the mirkwood forest, the combined thread of the orcs rises and it get much harder to hide (to quest). But I noticed that you cannot defeat this stage if you lose Elrond's Message and it gets guarded by orcs. Because of that, I added the note that you can fight the orcs that guard Elronds' Message. I don't know how I can express this better. Any suggestions?

I didn't playtest it solo or with more than 2 players yet. I think, you are right about the higher difficulty for more than 2 players. The Northern tracker is very good for this stage ^^

Ok, get guarded 2 now. Thought it might have meant that but wasn't sure. As this is intended though you should change your set up message on 1A, where it specifically states adding one encounter card to guard the message...

for the wording on 2B, try something like...

"Orcs remain in the staging area during the encounter phase and do not make engagement checks. Players can choose to engage an Orc, but only an Orc that is guarding Elrond's map. "

You should also announce your szenarion in the Heidelberger Forum in order to get some response to the German version. I really like the ideas in your szenario and will test it for sure. But I cannot tell you when, yet.

At my last session I managed the Anduin szenarion for the first time and so I am now looking forward to testing the third szenario for the first time and perhaps testing out whether my deck manages the Anduin a second time :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
