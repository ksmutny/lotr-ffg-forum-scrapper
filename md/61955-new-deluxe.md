As the last pack of the Dwarrodelf has been announced, what do you guess is coming next?

I remember Khazad-dum was announced right around time of Rhosgobel (third pack) so we may wait a little longer yet... who knows.

I cast my vote for something Elven, hopefully we shall see the area of former Rhudaur being covered.

mmmmm.....my heart yearns for the shire.......but i dont see it coming yet

im not sure- its really an open road though isnt it? i mean FFG have been releasing random traits/themes since the start, so its hard to guess

i mean taking all the rohan cards we got from mirkwood- i would have said that we'd be getting rohan- not khazad dum, but khazad dum we got

id really like to see barrow downs/bree/old forest/shire area all in a cycle- see a lot of hobbits- perhaps half-orc spies in the area, some wights and so on- seeing as the shire's so quiet im interested how theyre going to themetically put in a load of enemies

What im guessing will be lothlorien, as its near moria, so after fleeing the balrog- if that is indeed what we have to do, then we can go down to see galadriel and co. then i dont know- who knows what ffg have in store- perhaps they intend now to follow each pack on? we could end up down the anduin and into rohan, and then onto isengard? or gondor? then morgul vale, then mordor?

i dont see them doing that- its too linear, i see them more jumping about over middle earth.....infact on that point, i dont see any real clues as to what 'release' strategy FFG are going for, but i guess its too early to tell

ps thanks for posting this.....i love these guess whats coming threads.....been wanting to discuss it for ages

## 3 [Rince on March 17, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61955-new-deluxe/?do=findComment&comment=606634)

 I would love to see the barrow downs as well. And the Old Forest.

Hm, I guess the shire cycle will come out with the first of the movies and a cycle which leads us to erebor will come out with the start of the second movie.

as stated in another post today- i sincerely hope that FFG takes no ques at all from the films-the films arent the be all and end all of middle earth, and if they are taking the films as a basis for their product then that isnt a good thing at all (apart from the obvious good business sense)

Yes, but Films=Exposure=Sales=Profit=FFG Wanting to Keep Making the Game. I wouldn't dismiss the idea too quickly.

## 8 [richsabre on March 17, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61955-new-deluxe/?do=findComment&comment=606673)

indeed- and as i said its top business sense, but from a personal view, i bought this game in the first place becuase it took no indications from the film (well a few obvious artwork ones) but apart from that i loved the fact that it went on the books and that alone

if ffg were on thier knees and about to fold then what the hell - go for it, but i see no immeditate need for them to jump aboard pj's money wagon

anyways- if they brought out the shire soon id be over the moon anyways

## 9 [The_Fallen_Arises on March 17, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61955-new-deluxe/?do=findComment&comment=606678)

 This game needs more Hobbit stuff...we have two heroes, granted, but Hobbit allies are subpar at best. There are some really cool non-hero cards (like Fast Hitch) that i'd love to use more...However, I think Lorien is a fair guess, although the South and Mordor (along with Gondor) could also be a possibility.

## 10 [richsabre on March 17, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61955-new-deluxe/?do=findComment&comment=606681)

yeah....i d like to see ithillien too, get some rangers in....and maybe a picnic into morgul

dol amroth should have some epic tactics cards

though i think we wont see the south for a while yet......im sticking with my original prediction- lothlorien/great river with something else- i dont think the golden forest has enough 'stuff' to make it a deluxe and a 6 cycle .....i mean weve got enemies from moria near- but weve just been there so ffg are gonna do that, then weve got fangorn and the brown lands nearish

## 11 [player1761766 on March 17, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61955-new-deluxe/?do=findComment&comment=606713)

Looking at it based on what we've got so far, I think something Elvish is definitely a good bet. Khazad-dum has given us dwarf cards, and Dwarrowdelf, from all the official announcements, is set to give us dwarf and elf cards, so to bookend that, it makes sense (to me) to produce something with an Elven theme. Maybe after all our ferretting around in Moria for Elrond, we get to gambol back to Rivendell and make a report. I don't know. Doesn't seem to be much in the way of scope for adventure in that, however.

Seeing a card like Good Meal in Redhorn Gate got me thinking that they must be poised to give us more hobbits, though, and hopefully we won't get the bland "wandering took" type this time. Making a Shire-themed box though seems to pose the same problem as a Rivendell box (to me) - isn't the Shire meant to be a place where nothing bad has happened, where the hobbits just got on with their lives until the scouring near the end of the trilogy? I can't remember now, but aside from wanting the player cards, there doesn't seem (to me) to be the opportunity for much adventure there. Maybe this is why I'm not a game designer, though!

All this talk of iconic locations has got me thinking though - will we likely be seeing any player location cards? AGoT and W:I include such things as support cards, providing bonuses etc while they're out in play. The idea of setting Rivendell down to provide all your Elf chaps some sort of bonus, much like Khazad! Khazad! does for dwarves but with a bit more permanency, does appeal to me. Well, we'll see I suppose...

## 12 [richsabre on March 17, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61955-new-deluxe/?do=findComment&comment=606715)

player location cards----interesting...........mmmm

anyways..the shire..i think it would have to include the places that i stated- old forest and barrow downs and possibly bree......so theres plenty of scope of adventure there

## 13 [lleimmoen on March 17, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61955-new-deluxe/?do=findComment&comment=606725)

I think there is a hint in what you two (or more) are saying: the Shire, nothing is happening, but in fact that meant that Rangers were busy, so perhaps it won't be Shire (when that comes) but the surroundings and the Dúnedain but with some nice Hobbit cards in the mix. What do you think?

And yes, there have been a few hints toward the Hobbit theme but I GUESS it is not going to happen just yet, I really think (and hope) Elves are due now. Lothlórien is a good guess, makes sense as it is close to Moria. Rivendell is being mentioned in this cycle though, so that could be. And the surroundings of Rivendell are just as busy as the Shire perhaps, even with the cooperation between the Elves and Dúnedain. And the Goblin camps are nearby in the Misty Mountains, trolls are raiding in close range from Trollshaws up to Ettenmoors, and further still must be still some evil lurking left from the times of the Angmar realm.

## 14 [richsabre on March 17, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61955-new-deluxe/?do=findComment&comment=606731)

good points....i think theres plenty to go on----

weve got Sarn Ford which the rangers hold and the nazgul later break

also saruman was sending his servants into the shire too

there are wights sent from the witch king to the downs, and evil trees in the old forest (old man willow...what an enemy he is)

there are spies in bree, and bill ferny

we know wolves have a habit of coming into the shire

there is cirdan and his havens not a million miles away

dwarves from the blue mountains are passing the shire on their travels

elves are departing and passing through the shire ways

 

i agree with rivendell...plenty there with the trollshaws and ettenmoors, and mount gundabad to the north

and weve got all eregion to explore which ive heard is just lovely in the summer months :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

## 15 [lleimmoen on March 17, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61955-new-deluxe/?do=findComment&comment=606739)

And logisticaly, it would not be unwise if these two were to come in succession, after Mirkwood followed by Moria, we can get Rivendell area followed by Shire area... the good thing about the latter two is that there are so many iconic places around. If Moria and the Road to Rivendell (and back again - aparently) are good enough for a deluxe plus six packs, I think Eriador is well set for at least 2 deluxe and 12 regular expansions.

The only problem with this logic may be that if we get one theme after another from this part of the world, the other factions (like Gondor especially) may seem very neglected and their heroes and allies lacking on synergies.

## 16 [richsabre on March 17, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61955-new-deluxe/?do=findComment&comment=606742)

agreed....however ffg have been rather randomly releasing allies to and fro all over the place...i mean rohan got ALOT of love in mirkwood, so maybe even if we see the shire, perhaps a random such as gondor or dale will get some love....i suppose you could link them in

dale had dealings with the shire for a while after bilbo's return

gondor and the dunedain are related

gondor and arnor are related and the shire was part of arnor

the links are there---not that they need to relate- i didnt see any answer for the rohan allies- the closest we got to it was emyn muil east wall

## 17 [lleimmoen on March 17, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61955-new-deluxe/?do=findComment&comment=606746)

Too true. I know this was not a problem before. I for some reason thought of Gondor who beside the heroes (which are great) only got 3 allies (one of which is sh*te, guess which). But we really are in the very beginnings (hopefully they won't prove me wrong by running into bankruptcy).

## 18 [SiCK_Boy on March 17, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61955-new-deluxe/?do=findComment&comment=606747)

I'd also vote for the Shire and its surroundings. No urge in moving south yet. There's room to create some adventure around ether the spies, maybe a quest to thwart Saruman's plans on seizing the Southfarthing's herb plantations...

But I actualy believe they'll want to send us toward the Lonely Mountain soon. They'd be crazy to not try to link with the upcoming movies (doesn't mean they'll follow it, but they can build on the momentum while retaining their independant creative freedom). There are plenty of adventures to be had in this area; we know Sauron eventualy tried to corrupt the dwarven kingdoms and they were under attack during the war of the rings; there are bound to be some scouting adventure possible during the timeframe covered by the game.

## 19 [richsabre on March 17, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61955-new-deluxe/?do=findComment&comment=606749)

yeah guard of the citadel is terrible- i assume you mean him other wise there must be 2 aweful ones

thing is, when they release these random allies from far off areas, what happens when we get to these areas? i mean take rohan for instance, which must be an deluxe at some point seeing its importance...now will ffg have a hard time bringing out more rohan cards when we finally get there?

khazad dum wasnt a problem- we didnt have many dwarves at all, but mirkwood may as well have been called rohan/eagle cycle

obviously theres plenty to do on an entire country, but still, people may be a little sick of rohan allies by the time we get there (or maybe if they leave it long enough it will work out- which is probably what theyll do)

 

## 20 [lleimmoen on March 17, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61955-new-deluxe/?do=findComment&comment=606766)

I want to do a post on terrible cards. Guard will be there, first place likely. I wrote about him shortly after the release, and you know some cards age well, this guy has only gotten worse in my view, he is no way. And there are bad cards with nice theme but this Citadel Guard has defense of 0! And (not to offend the artist) I quite dislike the picture and scratch my head why this card got on the cover of the box.

Yes, I believe they should put Rohan further off. Of course I would like to see Éomer and especially Théoden (I have a hunch he will be great fun to play, perhaps having some sort of kingly effect as Dain has) but I see it would be unfair to further expand on their realm before other factions will have grown in power.

## 21 [lleimmoen on March 17, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61955-new-deluxe/?do=findComment&comment=606770)

I know many love the Dwarves. And reading the Hobbit, I have to fall in that category too. But in the game, I see their flooding as another potential threat. There were 13 with Bilbo, unfortunately we will not see Thorin, Kili, Fili but the other ten are all possible (and 3 reality already). And take this, we already have 5! Dwarven heroes as opposed to 1 Silvan and now 2 Noldor. I hope not to see another Dwarven hero in this cycle but I feel we shall. I would rather see them as allies. Bofur is mighty one by the way, the real thing.

## 22 [richsabre on March 17, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61955-new-deluxe/?do=findComment&comment=606776)

what has always confused me is that thorin was released by barachi (i think thats the artist name- the same as did beravor- amazing artist) on his/her site...did ffg just think about it, commision it, then realise he was dead??? he cant still be coming as i doubt he would have been put on the site..anyways.

i think we shall see all of thorins co remaing before the end of this cycle, i think for sure we will see bombur which i am looking forward to

in a post several months ago i did a list of all the nations/traits/creatures that havnt even emeraged....just to see how much scope ffg had to work on, and if that is ok with you i shall do the same here, if anything to satisfy my own curiosity....

what we havnt seen...some are more likely than others but i attempt to give a full list

ENTS/HUORNS

DRUANDAIN/WOSES

WIGHTS

UNDEAD ARMY

OTHER SPIRIT THINGS- ie watchers at cirith ungol

HARADRIM

EASTERLINGS

BLACK NUMENOREANS

WHATEVER THE HELL BOMBADIL/GOLDBERRY ARE

STONE GAINTS

OLOG HAI

WERE-WOMRS of the east- pushing it a bit me-thinks

i may come back as i think of more

anyways.....im not sure what that proves...perhaps it gives you hope for the amount things FFG have yet to touch on

I've said it everywhere else, though, so I'll say it here too - I really hope for some Haradrim soon!!

well we'd definatly have to go south for that.....dont worry, theyre a core part of the armies of evil so we will definatly see them at some point

now the easterlings on the otherhand attacked dale/erebor area, so we may see them quicker i believe

OH I FORGOT- MUMAK!!!

what a card that will be

10 defene and 20 hit points, and everytime you attack it you have a chance of being stamped on!

Mumak of Harad

engagement value- 25

threat 5

attack 7

defense 10

hit points 20

Forced: after declaring an attack on Mumak of Harad discard the top card of the encounter deck. If that card is an enemy, discard all characters taking part in the attack

Man, there's just so much good stuff that could come out of this, I might just explode with delight...

## 26 [richsabre on March 17, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61955-new-deluxe/?do=findComment&comment=606837)

yes, thats what i will feel like when we get to the shire....middle earths a beautiful place, but there aint no place like the good old shire.....ivy bush inn anyone?

## 27 [lleimmoen on March 18, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61955-new-deluxe/?do=findComment&comment=606910)

Yes, please. Ivy Bush, Green Dragon, etc. It is indeed the Shire that brings the warmest of feelings. And as the spring slowly springs, I feel like I should reread the book(s), I am just not sure whether to pick up the Hobbit of the Fellowship.

I hope to see the inns as interesting locations or objectives, or even attachments (on locations - I hope to see more of those like Ancient Mathom, I think it is a great idea).

The Shire is great because so many things meet up there, as mentioned above, the Elves wander through, the Dwarves dwell near by, and the evils are really "cool" too. I want to see spies, bandits, wolves, and even the trolls from the area seem much more interesting than elsewhere.

## 28 [Tornak2 on March 18, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61955-new-deluxe/?do=findComment&comment=607061)

Hi, it is my very first post ever in any forum so please be kind (and English is not my mother tongue). 

I've read several suggestions about what kind of cycle ffg could come out with.  Shire, Isengard, Gondor... but still wondering what's on the mind of Nathan French and his team. 

If they consider The Lord of the Ring lcg to be based on Tolkien's complete work instead of the 3 tomes' story everyone knows about, we should even expect to buy someday quests or allies, even heroes based on underdog characters such as the two other Istari, Alatar and Palando.

I'm refering to another card game that was released I believed in 1995, Middle Earth: the Wizard.  Too many rules but a great game.  Anyway, it was possible to play heroes from the first to the third age together.

I would not have expected the same from FFG but since I discovered from you guy that Eleanor and Berevor are made-up heroes, I am opened  to everything.

Why not thinking the we might get a cycle about the dragons.  Since Smaug could be defeated on the last quest of a ''Dale cycle'' or Erebor, or Lonely Mountain, another cycle could show up final stage enemies such as Scatha, Eärcaraxë, Bairanax, Agburanar, Scorba and Daelomin, since every dragon covers a specific region of Middle Earth.

## 29 [richsabre on March 18, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61955-new-deluxe/?do=findComment&comment=607067)

hi, and welcome tornak...do not fear- you will find us a pleasant bunch on here :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

i had this discussion a few months ago and i do not belive it is as simple as FFG saying yeah lets create the blue wizards, or yep lets take something out of unfinsihed tales and put it in. they all have different licenses, and while ffg may be allowed to create their own content (to an extent) it all depends on what license they have at the moment

i have heard that christopher tolkien guards the rights to the silmarillion like a dragons horde

now we have seen alot of characters, some from the hobbit, some from the trilogy, but i doubt ffg will ever go so far as to break tolkien lore as to have 1st,2nd and 3rd age characters all togetther- i hope they dont

now when ive said this previously - people have said wait? we already can take characters and put them through moria, and then have them live out thier lives until the fellowship events- whats that about then?

well----theres limits.......and i dont think ffg will ever do 1st age material....could be wrong, but i dunno, just dont feel it ever going there

and anyways my tolkien puriest self says i dont want that to happen, as much as i crave new material

you say nate considers this game to be based on ALL tolkiens work? ..he's got his work cut out for him then, because with the silmarillion, akallabeth, Ufinished tales, the hobbit, the trilogy, the appendices, tom bomadils adventures....theres a hell of a lot there....the heirs of numenor its self inc.all the days in exile would give them years worth of heros

most of those dragons are iron crown creations correct? the only tolkien named dragons i cant think of are smaug, glaurung, ancalagon and scatha....the iron crown game i have never played, though what i have gleamed from looking at it, it seems to be a lot more looser on the lore of arda than this game

mind you i would love to see the blue wizards if we ever went east- thought being failed and leaders of cults as tolkien guesses- they may end up being enemies

PS. a shameless advert- seeing as you seem keyed in with tolkien lore - take a look at my series on mondays- they may (or may not!) be of interest to you

## 30 [SiCK_Boy on March 18, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61955-new-deluxe/?do=findComment&comment=607079)

 Tornak: FFG established that the timeline for the game's adventures resides between the end of The Hobbit and Bilbo's birthday party in The Fellowship of the Ring.

Although nothing could prevent them from stepping away from this rule, I think they'll stick to it for a while, creating adventures based on tid-bits we know happened but never saw fully recounted in the books (like the capture of Gollum; although we know that Aragorn did it pretty much by himself in the books, it was an untold tale).

So I don't see us going to kill Smaug, since he died in The Hobbit. But exploring the happenings in the Dale area during those subsequent years could be a way to get a cycle located in this area.

## 31 [richsabre on March 18, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61955-new-deluxe/?do=findComment&comment=607084)

i thought they had said that sick boy- though i wasnt fully sure so i didnt mention it

also the hunt for gollum got its own chapter in unfinished tales, though i dont particularly think that ffg took much (if anything) from it that couldnt be found in the appendices

## 32 [booored on March 18, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61955-new-deluxe/?do=findComment&comment=607089)

I would like to see 2 different major expansions... the areas surrounding the White City. This is could be a really cool set of quests that are about securing the area rather than "traveling". As the men of Gondor were the wall between Mordor and the free peoples. So like each quest could be written as part of a camping (like a startergy game) were Gondor is defending and securing towns and trade routs and stuff... also of course be cool to see some love sent to the realm of men instead of the alien races. Anyway, I feel a set focusing on teh white city would be sweet and the art would be awesome.

Also I forget the name but that spooky area that all the undead cursed people live that Aragorn rallies for the war. Undead are always cool for art sake and I think that the dead marshes was a wasted opportunity to see some spooky stuff... I think the themeing of this area would also make a fantastic setting for the game.

Actually from the rule book:

"These quests take place during a timespan of 17 years: from when Bilbo celebrates his 111th birthday (and Frodo’s 33rd) to days just prior to Frodo’s leaving the Shire."  Although they obviously have broken that with Frodo at least.

I think that the time period you mentioned has a lot of potential, but would require some cards mods / deletions -- Bilbo with the ring, no Frodo, teen age Aragon, Boromir, and Eowyn (bad images of heros in high school), the turning of Saruman, etc.  I still think a deluxe in this time period will probably be issued when the movie comes out.  FFG could do it well, or they could really break things.

 Aragorn would be fine. He is 70 years old when Bilbo has his 111 birthday.
