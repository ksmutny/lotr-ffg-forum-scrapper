With all the recent talk of errata and the (friendly) trashing of some cards (Glorfindel *ahem*), I thought I'd just start a new topic and let everybody get it all out. 

 

What cards would you errata or modify and how?  Feel free to discuss why, but I'd rather get a constructive collection of ideas instead of a series of rants.

Glorfindel (Spirit)

 

change his ability to: 

 

Forced: After Glorfindel exhausts, raise your threat by 1.

 

 

 

He would still be the king of secrecy heroes, but LoV no longer makes him unstoppable.  His stats and his traits still make him extremely viable IMO.

Attached location does not contribute its threat to the quest.

It's not a project.  I just thought I'd make a separate thread for people to vent and perhaps get some interesting ideas in the process.

explanation:  

 

power in the earth:  my personal nominee for least useful card in the set.  Increasing its cost and its effect would make it comparable to the situationally useful Secret Paths, while making it distinct in its usage.  

 

Blue Mountain Trader:  as printed, its effect can be used any number of times instantly, allowing players to more or less rearrange their entire resource pool at will.  I have trouble believing this was the intent.  Putting an exhaust requirement on the card puts a practical but not invincible limit on the effect.  The ally is viable enough already due to its cost and Dwarf trait.

Favor of the Lady:

 

Cost: 0

 

Attach to a hero.

 

Action: Spend 1 resource from attached hero's resource pool and exhaust Favor of the Lady to give attached hero +2 (will) until the end of the phase.

 

Increased willpower bonus with ongoing cost to allow the card to be worth including.  It's closest competition I think is from Dunedain Quest and Celebrian Stone.  My question is whether or not a single point of willpower is worth a card slot, regardless of cost.  This is my solution.  

## 11 [Olorin93 on July 1, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/109818-community-errata/?do=findComment&comment=1139894)

I'd lower the cost to play Radagast from 5 to 3, and make all upcoming ents Creatures. Though it seems Treebeard will be for ents what Radagast is (supposed to be) for eagles.

Hirluin the Fair

 

remove his ability to pay for outland allies of any sphere.

 

He is already the recipient of the the outlands bonuses, which lets his stats quickly exceed his threat, plus his ranged ability in leadership.  With his sphere-bending ability, there is almost no reason for all outlands allies not to be included by default, which turns any deck he's in into an outlands deck.  Without the ability, he's still extremely viable and the player must be more creative when constructing outlands decks in order to pay for them.

This would do nothing on it's own. It needs an instruction to add it to victory display when played, and for this you don't need any victory points on the card actually.

I'd rather "exhaust Legacy of Durin to" this card.

## 19 [danpoage on July 1, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/109818-community-errata/?do=findComment&comment=1139963)

Page 24 of the rules actually says that when a card with victory points leaves play, it is added to the victory display. Player cards like Black Arrow specifically mention to add the card to the victory display as part of the cost of triggering the effect, but this is not technically required for the "has Victory points" passive effect to function. This is why enemies and locations with Victory: X "just work" and do not require further text about where to put them when they leave play.

 

My intent was to change the card as little as possible. The effect of Will of the West could also be changed to:

 

"Action: Add Will of the West to the victory display to choose a player. Shuffle the chosen player's discard pile into their deck."

 

This is functionally equivalent to my change of adding 1 victory point, it is just more explicit about Will of the West not going to the discard pile. As much as I enjoy nitpicking rules minutiae, I think the intent was pretty clear with my original post.

Usually the willpower faction is more expensive than defense or attack faction. For example, allies. The allies with more wp are more expensive than allies with more defense or attack. So the attachments are the same: for example, the dunedain attachments. 1 defense costs 1 resource; 1 attack point costs 1 resource; and 1 willpower costs 2 resources.

 

So Favour of the Lady is correct.

I agree that it is correct and consistent.  My concern, as I stated, was whether it is worth a card slot to use a card with a single point of willpower.  Thus, I attempted to increase the bonus and up the cost in a particular way.  If you don't agree that it's necessary, that's fine.  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] 

 

If you like the card as printed, I'd be very curious about how many times it gets included in decks.  I, for one, have never considered it.  

 

No disrespect intended by my answer.  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

## 22 [danpoage on July 1, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/109818-community-errata/?do=findComment&comment=1140029)

Favor of the Lady is particularly mediocre when you compare it to Unexpected Courage for the same cost. Granted, Unexpected Courage only has 1 copy in the Core Set, but "rarity" is not supposed to be a design factor in LCGs.

 

To be honest, I don't think that I would use your revised version of this card either. However, I definitely agree that the card as-is lacks a compelling reason to be included in any deck. Even if it only cost 1, which would be too low from a balance standpoint, I would rather include Westfold Horse-breeder or Silvan Refugee for the same cost. Chump blockers are just more useful than attachments (with basically equivalent value) in 9 of 10 situations. The fact that Spirit has cards like Unexpected Courage, Arwen, and a host of excellent Rohan allies, all at 2 cost, just dooms this card to mediocrity. Heck even Stand and Fight is much better than this card, in the sense that you can get an additional use of a 1 or 2 cost ally, as an action.

From Rulebook:

 

Some enemy and location cards award victory points
when they are defeated. When such a card leaves play,
one player should place it near his threat dial to remind
the players of the victory points when they are scoring
at the end of the game. It is recommended that one
player collects all the victory cards the players earn
during the scenario, as victory points are applied to the
score of the entire group.

 

 

It specifies only enemies and locations. That's why each player card must contain text that it's being added to the victory display.

## 24 [chrsjxn on July 2, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/109818-community-errata/?do=findComment&comment=1140330)

This is just me, maybe, but I wouldn't errata cards to make them more powerful, only less.

 

Blue mountain trader should legitimately be once per round, so that players can't just rearrange all their resources at will.

 

But I don't see anything wrong with Favor of the Lady. It's a bit of a weak card, because 1 card + 2 resources (especially in Spirit!) for 1 willpower is not very efficient. Though it's less fragile than allies in most scenarios, which makes it a little better than you might expect.

 

Regardless, I think that's an example of a kind of card that must exist in a game like this: a sub-optimal card.

 

Imagine another game like LOTR:LCG, where each card adds pretty linearly to the power of things you have in play. (Outlands doesn't work like that, but playing one more dwarf doesn't exponentially increase the power of your other dwarves. Same with just about everything that isn't Outlands.) The more similar the cards are in power level and cost, the less it matters what cards you pick for your decks. You could just throw in anything, and do about as well as someone who really knows the game and puts a lot of thought into their choices.

 

But when the cards vary in power level, picking the best cards for your deck is an important skill that differentiates better players from worse.

 

And then you can consider that the power level of cards varies with the different quests. Willpower boosts are more valuable in quests that use the stat for more than just questing. And, of course, they're entirely worthless if you're just going to be doing Siege/Battle.

## 25 [MyNeighbourTrololo on July 2, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/109818-community-errata/?do=findComment&comment=1140351)

I would make Favor of the Lady something like this:

 

Spirit Attachment

Cost: 2

Condition.

 

Attach to a hero.

 

Limit 1 per hero(?).

 

Attached hero gets +1 Willpower. (+2 Willpower instead if he is the only questing hero you control.)

Yes and no.

 

Deckbuilding is more than just figuring out the most powerful cards, you also need cards that have synergy, cover weaknesses, counter threats from the encounter deck effectively, work well with partner decks (if applicable), ect. Almost anyone can tell you if a card is "powerful", but only the skilled deckbuilders can direct and balance that power appropriately. 

 

Therefore, if there was a game where every card was about the same power level, there would still be differentiation between skilled and non-skilled deck builders, because the skilled deck builder looks at all the things mentioned above, not just how powerful a card is in it's own vacuum. 

 

What's my point? Favor of the lady is a pretty mediocre card not only because of its lack of obvious power, but because of it's lack of synergy with other cards and because of that, without knowing future cards, it doesn't really deserve a card slot at it's current power level. I could be wrong, maybe a deckbuilder more skilled than I could find a deck where this is the best card to take up 1-3 slots for that deck, but I very much doubt it.

I'd add restricted to a ton of cards. SoG and UC for example. I'd also put a hand limit of 8 cards, so you need to discard at the end of the turn if your over 8.

## 29 [Nerdmeister on July 2, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/109818-community-errata/?do=findComment&comment=1140652)

Favor of the Lady is viable in a quest like, but not necessarily limited to, Journey to Rhosgobel where alot of treachery cards deal damage to exhausted, questing or characters with no attachments. In the instance where your 2WP but 1HP allies die off quite easily because you cannot keep readying attachments on all of them, that small +1WP, which cannot be removed by treachery as fast as your weak allies, suddenly has more worth.

Just a thought to contemplate.

## 30 [MyNeighbourTrololo on July 2, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/109818-community-errata/?do=findComment&comment=1140680)

I like what you are trying to do, but I'd stick to minor changes.

 

I think Favor of the Lady would work with a cost of 1, because it's in the Willpower sphere. It would be usefull in quests with much Ally hate.

 

Power in Earth could be -2 or -3. The effect is equivalent for many locations and it won't broke high Threat other Locations.

Would raising number of quests where it is semi-viable to 2 or 3 change something? That's a rhetorical question, by the way.

I think the idea of a lot of player cards is for specific quests. The card is not good or bad if it runs in all scenarios. Each card depends of each scenario. For example, Ever My Heart Rises (when there are mountain locations).

So Favor of the Lady is a very good card in scenarios like: Dead Mashes, Shadow of the Past, Stone of Erech, Druadan Forest, Orc Hunting (a fanmade of mine ^^), Redhorn Gate...

Another reason: cards are not good or bad as alone cards. They are good or bad in relation to another combos. So Favor of Lady is very good, for example, with Unexpected Courage, in, for example, Dead Mashes.

Dbeast, thank you for opening this topic. I really dislike cards that glue to my binders and never see play. Waste of cardboard, space, art, design, etc.

 

Mndela, I prefer when cards can be useful in many quests as possible. Some cards being better in some quest are OK. But cards that are only going to see play in one or two quests? Not a fan =/

 

I'm with alogos that we need to put things in the context and look to similar cards to help balance.

 

I'm with danpoage when he says that simple modifications are better. Because it is more elegant, easier to remember and better for the game.

 

Next reply my list of opinions on the cards that were already suggested in this topic.

Below my personal list of changes that I like and would use no problem at all.

 

Power in the Earth: -2 threat.

 

Blue Mountain Trader: Once per round.

 

Favor of the Lady: Cost 1.

 

Will of the West: Add "Victory: 1" (I dont care what the rules say)

 
Horn of Gondor: Add "Limit (3 times per round.)"
 
Legacy of Durin: Add "exhaust Legacy of Durin to"
 

## 39 [Edvando on July 2, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/109818-community-errata/?do=findComment&comment=1140787)

Some new suggestions:

 

*DISCLAIMER: Some of my opinions are personal taste and I will say so. So i don't expect people to agree. The other examples, yes, i care if you agree or not =]

 

Dunedain Cache: Cost 1.

 

I never saw this attachment in any deck, even online.

 

Dwalin: After Dwalin attacks and destroys an enemy, lower your threat by 1.

 

Hate that he is only used against some decks. Heroes should be generic and this Dwalin above would be awesome to play with.

 

Glorfindel (lore): Remove "once per round".

 

He cost A LOT, so his ability should be worth to put on the table, like Elrond. Maybe this help (probable not).

 

Bilbo: Draws 1 additional card in the resource phase.

 

When I play him, I am the person that want to draw more! This is personal taste.

 

Mirlond: Each hero you control gets -1 threat cost.

 

So she can see more play. Another personal taste.

 

Pippin (spirit): Remove "If each hero you control has the Hobbit trait, Pippin gains:"

 

Pippin lore is so much better and this requirement make him too much specialized to hobbit decks. I would also change his name to some less know hobbit, so he can pair up with the other Pippin and increase the hobbit deck possibilities. If you also make that the enemy can't engage anymore (like some people wrongly think him works), he would be a REALLY good deck for some decks and see more play. Maybe making Dunhere decks more viable against harder quests.

 

Thalin is playable, but I hate to put his 1 WP to quest. I would remove -1 def to +1 wp. Maybe this make him OP, but right now staging sniping is not really a good deck for most quests.

 

Brand is playable, but overshadowed by legolas that is REALLY good, so I never see him played. Make +1 HP, -1 Def, helps him, so that he can quest and be better at soaking undefended attacks and suffering through treachery cards. Also could be -1 def, -1 threat. Bard suffer the same fate of Brand, but less so. Personal taste.

 

Theoden is really underwhelming, but playable. If solo, he gives +1 WP to another hero (cos generally at least one hero will stay ready to atk/def, seeing that he works with tactics). In Multiplayer, he can be quite good, but not really cos most tactics heroes don't want to quest. So maybe +2, +3 in the best case scenario. Remember that the self +1 WP is already in his threat cost. My opinion is that he should give +1 to every tactic or rohan and don't care for printed, making song of battle a little better. Personal taste.

 

Ancient Mathon: "you draws 3 cards". Same as Bilbo, personal taste and greed.

Yes, but 2 resource and 1 card is still high. We should adress Outlands one post or another : 2 cost, 1 card, a hell lot more powerfull than Favor of the Lady.

Also, Dunedan Quest is better, you can move it. Celebrian's Stone is +2 with a bonus for Aragorn, while being restricted so it's a balanced.

Unexpected Courage will be balanced the day readying card would be all over our card pool, which will happen one day, be it 20 years from now, or never at death of the game.

Since outlands is a very mutable resource, would you care to elaborate what you believe one gets for a 2 cost card?

 

Dunedain Quest takes resources to move it; you´re kinda making it sound as if you can do it for free.

 

Celebrian´s Stone is also unique besides being restricted. Want to be sure to get it during the game then put 3 copies in and the two remaining are discard fodder.

 

All cards have their strong points and their weak points but Favor of the Lady is not just a "bad card".

To limit the Outlands : Each Outlands gain : limit 2 per deck

To limit the Doomed cards : Each Doomed cards gain : limit one per deck

 

Like this :

 

Dwalin: After Dwalin attacks and destroys an enemy, lower your threat by 1.

Maybe making Dunhere decks more viable against harder quests.

 

Glorfindel:  second that.  Remove the once per round limit.  He'd be worth using.  With Elrond, he's not worthless, but that combo puts you at 25 threat before adding another hero... not good.

 

Bilbo:  During the resource phase, perhaps choose a player to draw 1 card.

 

Mirlonde:  perhaps -1 threat for each Lore, Silvan or Noldor hero you control.  Is that too complicated?

The very thought of troll-on-troll violence makes this bear shed a single, giant, honey-scented tear.

 

Incidentally, I agree that Mirlonde would be better if her ability applied to Silvan heroes rather than Lore heroes. I understand that the AtS cycle was trying to encourage mono-sphere decks (with mixed results), but I think encouraging multi-sphere Silvan decks would be a lot more interesting for this hero. Oh well, instead she will be relegated to a few Lore-heavy decks. I do hope that the Silvan archetype has room for her, but with more Silvan heroes on the way, I have my doubts.

How do you consistently play songs? He needs 2-3 songs in a turn to make a single defense. Ok, he is playable, but I would like if you could elaborate more that deck of yours =D

Sure, but this FAQ is more a personal thing. Use what you like, dismiss what you don't. Of course we could really make a unofficial errata and I'm in favor of it. Since this is a non-competitive game, we run in less trouble.

Theoretically, in multiplayer, lore player can slap 3 loves of tales on each of his heroes, and then for each single song played, each Harbor Master would get +3 defense. All songs can be spread among the all players. The main problem here is that there is not that much useful songs to go around. Lay of Nimrodel, Durin's Song, Song of Earendil and probably Song of Mocking... I'll be silent about fall of Gil-Galad.

Blade Mastery:

 

reduce the cost to 0.  Behind Strong Walls gives +1 defense and a re-ready.  Feint fully stops an enemy attack. IMHO, this card doesn't really compare and hasn't made the cut for me in a long time.  Same complaint as Favor of the Lady - the effect is too small to justify a card slot.  Reducing the cost to 0 could secure it a place as a good twitch reaction card, since it wouldn't tie up resources.  

 

edit: reduce the cost to 0, but keep the original effect.

 

Harbor Master:

 

I don't think I'd touch this one.  It seems balanced, even though I find it's theme and usage a bit awkward.

Hmm, this is probably me being stupid, but how does the new dwarf guy (Blue Mountain Trader) let players rearrange resources as they wish? As I read him, the receiving player moves a resource to the player that sends the trader. Then, if that Trader wants to move again, whoever receives it must move a resource from their resources. So doesn't the Trader (even with 3 in play) just move resources individually between players. So if one player has, say, 10 resources, at most they can only move 1 from their pile to another player per Blue Mountain Trader in play? Since the Trader is discarded if now resources are moved, you have to essentially negate the effect to get the Trader back in position to shuttle a resource.

 

Sorry, that is garbled, but I'm concerned that everyone is reading something into the Trader that I can't see! The Wandering Took at least combo'ed Song of Earindel to allow a slow reduction in threat, whereas the Trader can't combo (as we've seen, the Harbour Master doesn't work).

 

I suppose one way to put it is:

One player is resource rich, the other plays Spirit.

Spirit player sends all three Traders over, and gains three resources.

In order to repeat the trick, the resource rich player must send the Traders back, and gain three resources in the process.

Overall, no gain to either player.

 

I can see that in specific circumstances the ability to shunt a resource over temporarily is useful, but I feel like the hyperbole that's being spoken about Blue Mountain Trader somehow allowing free reorganisation of resources is a bit OTT. He's not much better than some old resource moving effects. Frankly, Errand Rider is quite a bit better in many ways (cheaper, fits the sphere for most resource gaining effects, simple to use, very repeatable).

 

OK, that was a long post. Sorry!

It just make bi and tri -sphere deck much more manageable around the table with just one. Seems no that powerfull, yes, but there is some deck that can abuse this, because it is not limited. Sure, you'll need at least one ressource, but to make the comparison, is like having an inifnite A Good Harvest. There is also a lot of way you get more powerful by gathering ressource on only one Hero.

So if you don't deckbuild around him, he is like the best song (sphere giver) ever, and if you deckbuild around him, he is one of the best card enabler for certain cards, and while some need a little boost like that, some might just go overpowered.

## 69 [MyNeighbourTrololo on July 5, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/109818-community-errata/?do=findComment&comment=1144358)

Here is situation for you:

Player 1 has Boromirt(Tactics), Theodred(Leadershit) and Denethor(Lore). Player 2 has Eowyn and 2 other Spirit heroes.

First turn, each hero generates 1 resource.

 

Player 2 plays Trader for 2 resources.

Player 1 has, lets say, wants to play Ithilien Archer, which is a 3 cost Lore card. He can't because he has only 1 Lore resource. 

 

Here is what happens:

Player 2 activates Trader, resource is moved from Boromir to Eowyn.

Player 1 activates Trader, resource is moved from Eowyn to Denethor.

Player 2 activates Trader, resource is moved from Theodred to Eowyn.

Player 1 activates Trader, resource is moved from Eowyn to Denethor.

Player 1 now has 3 Lore resources on Denethor and plays Ithilien Archer.

 

What were you saying about Errand Rider being better?

You're quite right, in this situation it's a powerful card, and I hadn't formulated the play like that. But I should say that I wasn't competing for points or anything with regard to Errand Rider, I genuinely didn't really see the power of the Trader. I can see how he works a bit more now, which is helpful - there is still a degree of hyperbole about his power, since overall one Trader can only move 1 resource between players, but it's much more clear how he allows re-organisation within each individual player's characters. Perhaps some change is needed, and certainly a requirement to exhaust is the obvious one. Food for thought then.

## 71 [MyNeighbourTrololo on July 5, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/109818-community-errata/?do=findComment&comment=1144487)

Exhaust would be too harsh for a 2-cost ally. Simple printed limit once per turn would suffice. 

## 72 [Catastrophic09 on July 11, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/109818-community-errata/?do=findComment&comment=1150581)

The only actual errata we have seen makes cards weaker not stronger so there are only a couple cards that I think are too powerful and their errata should be:

 

Glorfindel (Spirit) Raise your threat by 1 after Glorfindel commits to a quest.  He would still be powerful but not ridiculous with LoV

 

Dain Ironfoot should only give his boost to dwarves under your control. giving it to all dwarves in multiplayer is outrageous

 

Lure of Moria should cost 4 since its super close to Grim Resolve if you're playing all dwarves and seems way OP at 3 cost

 

Unexpected Courage should be limit one per deck because its such a superior readying ability

 

Steward of Gondor needs to cost at least 3 or even 4 because its such a huge resource engine at only 2 cost

 

Outlands characters could be fixed in many ways one being they only give each other outlands character a bonus and not themself or.. instead of being a passive ability they have to exhaust to give outlands characters the stat bonus.

## 73 [Catastrophic09 on July 11, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/109818-community-errata/?do=findComment&comment=1150592)

Now as many people have already done.. there are many cards that are weak and could easily be made useful again. I don't like having useless cards, its sad.. Someone posted a topic about this a while back so I'll just paste all my suggestions..

 
Bilbo Lore should obviously be less threat
 
Radagast should cost less, 4 would be better
 
Glorfindel Lore should heal 2 damage with one resource
 
Silverlode Archer- the Ithilien Archer has an extra defense, hit point AND ability for same cost.. wtf.. SA should have 3 attack
 
Beorning Beekeeper- an extra attack point or ability dealing damage to all enemies in play not just staging area
 
Ride to Ruin- should cost 0, you're discarding an ally!
 
We Do Not Sleep- the  worst readying ability event, for the same cost you can ready all characters! (Grim Resolve) or all Dwarves for only 3... And We Do Not Sleep is only good for "readying" after questing so it should only cost 4 max
 
Dawn Take You All should discard all shadow cards (from at least one player), it's a one time event and the dawn covers ALL darkness
 
Taking Initiative should discard the top two cards (maybe even add their value together) to increase this cards chance of working
 
Keeping Count should add: Response- after Keeping Count enters play search your deck for another Keeping Count. Limit 2 Keeping Count's allowed in play. 
 
Ravenhill Scout- he sucks and should only cost 2
 
Dunedain Wanderer should cost 4 and have Secrecy 2
 
The End Comes- this card shouldn't exist.. lol
 
Grave Cairn- who uses this? a character has just died, how much attack can they really have? this card should cost 0
 
Watcher of the Bruinen- since when is a 2 defense 2 hit point ally good for anything!? give him an extra hit point or defense
 
Short Cut- you're exhausting a Hobbit and paying one to replace an encounter card? you should be able to choose a location at any time
 
Out of Sight is too expensive, make it 4 cost Secrecy 2 and maybe allow you to choose a player (most of the Secrecy cards are overpriced and shouldn't be)
 
Late Adventurer- this is only if you suck at planning who to quest with, give that character an extra willpower and this card might enter decks
 
Wealth of Gondor/Gaining Strength- worth a card slot for only one resource? I sometimes use these but I feel they need a little more, add a card draw for Wealth and make it a net gain of 2 resources for Gaining Strength
 
Damrod- is his ability and stats worth that cost? how about an extra defense
 
Master of Lore- should not have been errata'd
 
Mirlonde should be printed Lore AND Silvan heroes get her discount because at max all her ability does is give you 3 less starting threat, she should also be one less starting threat herself, why not?
 
Pippin Spirit should not be limited to having all Hobbit heroes and his ability should only raise your threat by 2
 
Denethor Leadership ally should get -1 Willpower for each hero with 2 or more damage
 
Faramir Lore hero should have an extra ability or something that boosts his fellow faithful rangers (If Faramir has X attack, all Ranger characters you control get ????)
 
Caldara- her ability is to DISCARD her, give her less starting threat, 7 or even 6 and if the allies she could put into play weren't limited to Spirit.. then she would be powerful
 
Theoden- another hero from this cycle suffering with a poor ability, he should also have "Theoden can pay for Rohan allies from any sphere" he's the King of Rohan!! come on!
 
Forth Eorlingas! why be limited to Rohan heroes, make it Rohan characters, there's hardly anyone left in the staging area after engagement anyways or just make it 1 cost
 
Steed of the Mark is only worth it if attached hero has 3 or more willpower (so it may get better when those heroes come), why does it have to cost? just exhaust it for it's ability
 
Fatty Bolger- 6 starting threat since his ability raises threat and he's not that great anyways
 
I wonder if some of these cards were actually play-tested because they can be so weak and you handicap yourself if you play with them. Most of these fixes would have been real easy if they played with them or just thought.. hmm there's already a card that readies everyone for 5 and we're making a card specific for Rohan and limited to questing, it should only cost 4 or 3. Or MIrlonde seriously her ability could at max lower your starting threat by 3.. thats not doing much.. ugh it's just so disappointing to have such weak cards because then I never want to play them... but some I love the art or person and play anyways  ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

You have displayed the cards that are not easy to play in a normal deck. But the 95% of them i have seen them in special decks and they run very good.

## 75 [richsabre on July 11, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/109818-community-errata/?do=findComment&comment=1151068)

being perfectly honest i was holding off posting in this thread, mainly because i disagree with the very idea of errata unless its 100% needed (as in a broken card)

 

personally i would rather have 20 or so cards that are pretty awful generally but work well in theme or specific decks (or even decks that are weak on purpose to give a challenge on older quests if you dont have nightmare packs), than have 20 cards that dont work the way the text is printed on them... it just feels like you have a half-completed product

Mndela abd ruchsabre

 

Developers can make mistakes too. If you look at hearthstone, they do a lot of errata, making some cards stronger, some weaker. A lot of times. Why? Because they make mistakes, because they don't really know the game before people play then too long, they sometimes are too cautious when creating cards, they can overlook some cards (as you can see with the Blue Mountain Trader). I saw the interview with one of the Star Wards Devs that he said that if he could change some cards, he would, but because doing so is horrible for the players (because what they see on the cards does not correspond) they shy away of correcting it and keep the faq to a minimum, only doing corrections for misworded or broken cards. I understand why they do that.

 

My problem is having a lot of useless cardboard around, but those cards could be awesome (and fun) with a little push. That's why I find this discussion interesting. The devs are not going to use any of our card design here, so don't worry.

 

This came is not competitive and people can play with they friends with those errata no problem. I will if I can make a list of good errata that is not broken. My vision for my changes and suggestions are:

 

 1. The simpler, the better.
 2. Make the card useful, but not overpowered.
 3. Look at other cards to help design.
 4. Cards should be usable to as many decks possible (ex: Hero Dwalin)

Mndela and ruchsabre I think that you suggestions could be useful, if you have then.

well, from my perspective i feel lucky as i am

 

1- a weaker player

2- a theme player

 

so, i guess i am a little more merciful to weaker or strong cards, as they are never just sat there :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

 

actually, my other main concern for a growing errata, alongside my above points, is the players who dont frequent this forum or read through the insert fully... i really do believe that the players would benefit from having  a paper version of the faq inserted in the packs

 

i guess this would not add a huge amount onto the cost, especially as the errata isnt updated all that often, though it would depend on how it was printed...

 

if it would add a lot to the printing costs, then perhaps add them into the deluxe boxes only (as they are needed for the adventure packs anyways

Catastrophic09, great suggestions! I will give my two cents in your opinions.

 

> Glorfindel (Spirit) Raise your threat by 1 after Glorfindel commits to a quest.  He would still be powerful but not ridiculous with LoV
> 
>  

 

I try to avoid nerfs for the reasons that I said before. I agree with this, but would shy away of implementing it.

 

> Dain Ironfoot should only give his boost to dwarves under your control. giving it to all dwarves in multiplayer is outrageous

 
Same as above. But a 4 player all Dwarfs decks are INSANE.
 
> Lure of Moria should cost 4 since its super close to Grim Resolve if you're playing all dwarves and seems way OP at 3 cost

 
I never understood Lure of Moria. It is much better than Grim Resolve and We Do Not Sleep. I think each Ready All should be different from one another, So I would make it cost 2 and Dwarfs don't need to ready to defend and also give dwarfs the text from Stand Together. What do you think? The problem is that this is against my philosophy of "The Simpler, The Better". Personally I would make Grim Resolve cost 4 and keep Lure of Moria as is. 
 
> Unexpected Courage should be limit one per deck because its such a superior readying ability

 
Unexpected Courage is fine. Just buff Stead of the Mark and we are good.
 
> Steward of Gondor needs to cost at least 3 or even 4 because its such a huge resource engine at only 2 cost

 
Same as Nerf. But it would be probably fine to cost 3.
 
> Outlands characters could be fixed in many ways one being they only give each other outlands character a bonus and not themself or.. instead of being a passive ability they have to exhaust to give outlands characters the stat bonus.

 

Outlands are fine. Devs told us that they are a easy Trait for people that want it. They will probable not receive any more direct support. But I kinda dislike Ethir Swordsman because he is used in other decks too in place of Silvan Refugee. I would buff silvan to have 2hp and nerf Ethir. Not sure what to do with Ethir.

The idea of adding a print errata to the deluxe boxes is a REALLY great one. Worth of making a whole new topic on it so, maybe, devs see it. They will very hardly do it though =/

## 81 [Edvando on July 11, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/109818-community-errata/?do=findComment&comment=1151220)


Bilbo Lore should obviously be less threat

This changes nothing. One less threat and he is the same. Instead, I would +1 Def. Now he is playable as a defender (as Denethor). The problem is that maybe he overshadows Denethor.


Radagast should cost less, 4 would be better


Totally agree. His stats are horrible and his ability are not worth 2 more cost.


Glorfindel Lore should heal 2 damage with one resource


See my suggestion. This one is also good (and make the card much better then my suggestion).


Silverlode Archer- the Ithilien Archer has an extra defense, hit point AND ability for same cost.. wtf.. SA should have 3 attack


I'm ok with this. Maybe this make him godlike, but he is still a fragile ally that is very costly.


Beorning Beekeeper- an extra attack point or ability dealing damage to all enemies in play not just staging area

I like more the all enemies in play. To make him more unique instead of a dmg dealing ally for any deck.

 


Ride to Ruin- should cost 0, you're discarding an ally!

Two cards, 1 resource from the card plus the resource from the ally. Good change.


We Do Not Sleep- the  worst readying ability event, for the same cost you can ready all characters! (Grim Resolve) or all Dwarves for only 3... And We Do Not Sleep is only good for "readying" after questing so it should only cost 4 max

I would make it cost 3. Look at lure of moria!

 


Dawn Take You All should discard all shadow cards (from at least one player), it's a one time event and the dawn covers ALL darkness

Totally agree. Still maybe not good enough.

 


Taking Initiative should discard the top two cards (maybe even add their value together) to increase this cards chance of working

The design of this card is horrible. It should work in a two hero deck or a allyless deck. Even so, the deck need good costly card to make it work and most of those cards are allies. The problem with this errata is that it changes the spirit and the intent of the card. I don't know what would make this card elegant, make it viable in a two hero/allyless deck and that is a simple change.


Keeping Count should add: Response- after Keeping Count enters play search your deck for another Keeping Count. Limit 2 Keeping Count's allowed in play. 

+1 cost. If you don't, this card is too awesome and broken.

 


Ravenhill Scout- he sucks and should only cost 2

Totally agree. Would still make this card hard to put in a deck!

 


Dunedain Wanderer should cost 4 and have Secrecy 2

I'm ok with this. But it would still not be a good card. Make it neutral! Maybe this helps.

 


The End Comes- this card shouldn't exist.. lol

Agreed.

 


Grave Cairn- who uses this? a character has just died, how much attack can they really have? this card should cost 0

Agreed.


Watcher of the Bruinen- since when is a 2 defense 2 hit point ally good for anything!? give him an extra hit point or defense

An extra HP would be good enough.


Short Cut- you're exhausting a Hobbit and paying one to replace an encounter card? you should be able to choose a location at any time

Not sure of this one, but I don't like it though. Anyone has a suggestion?

 


Out of Sight is too expensive, make it 4 cost Secrecy 2 and maybe allow you to choose a player (most of the Secrecy cards are overpriced and shouldn't be)

Agreed. Maybe making it choose a player make it too good. But if we look at feint, that cost less and is useful in most if not all quests, you can make a case for this. Also, helps secrecy, that REALLY needs help.


Late Adventurer- this is only if you suck at planning who to quest with, give that character an extra willpower and this card might enter decks

Great idea. Totally agree.

 


Wealth of Gondor/Gaining Strength- worth a card slot for only one resource? I sometimes use these but I feel they need a little more, add a card draw for Wealth and make it a net gain of 2 resources for Gaining Strength

Good ideas. When you compare those to steward of gondor, you see how broken is steward. Those changes make those cards great and more competitive with steward. Still, steward overshadows both options.


Damrod- is his ability and stats worth that cost? how about an extra defense

Extra def is nice. Still almost impossible to use his ability and he would be a stat only ally. I would like to make his ability more useful somehow.


Master of Lore- should not have been errata'd

Master is the resource acceleration for lore. But he is fragile and take 3 turns to pay for himself. I would -1 cost and +1 hp. Maybe still not good though.


Mirlonde should be printed Lore AND Silvan heroes get her discount because at max all her ability does is give you 3 less starting threat, she should also be one less starting threat herself, why not?

The first part is ok, still weak but useful. The second part, I don't like it because it violate the implicit rule of the threat cost and make the card less elegant. 


Pippin Spirit should not be limited to having all Hobbit heroes and his ability should only raise your threat by 2

He is useful, the problem is the all hobbits that limit him too much. 2 threat is too low.


Denethor Leadership ally should get -1 Willpower for each hero with 2 or more damage

Not sure about this. He would be too good.


Faramir Lore hero should have an extra ability or something that boosts his fellow faithful rangers (If Faramir has X attack, all Ranger characters you control get ????)

-1 def and +1 atk would be enough.

 


Caldara- her ability is to DISCARD her, give her less starting threat, 7 or even 6 and if the allies she could put into play weren't limited to Spirit.. then she would be powerful

She is very powerful, but only goes in very limited decks. I like the idea of not limiting to Spirit allies. Maybe this make her useful in a 2 Hero Spirit deck.

 


Theoden- another hero from this cycle suffering with a poor ability, he should also have "Theoden can pay for Rohan allies from any sphere" he's the King of Rohan!! come on!

Yeah, this would be really nice. Compare him to Elrond and you see that he is not that broken if we do this.


Forth Eorlingas! why be limited to Rohan heroes, make it Rohan characters, there's hardly anyone left in the staging area after engagement anyways or just make it 1 cost

This one needs playtest! Not sure if one or both changes would be enough. I would go with Rohan Characters first.


Steed of the Mark is only worth it if attached hero has 3 or more willpower (so it may get better when those heroes come), why does it have to cost? just exhaust it for it's ability

If you make this change, basically we have a new Light of Valinor for anyone. Not sure what to do though. Make it 0 cost?

 


Fatty Bolger- 6 starting threat since his ability raises threat and he's not that great anyways

As I said before, this violate the implicit rule of threat cost. Not sure what to do with him. His ability is really good for the end of the scenario for the last punch or when the players are going to quest unsuccessfully or something. Very situational. Anyone has other suggestions?

Good suggestions all around!

 

I don't know how I ever missed We Do Not Sleep.  I tend to block certain cards out of my brain after years of non use.  

 

We Do Not Sleep:  cost=3

 

Forth Eorlingas!:  target all Rohan characters.

 

Theoden:  Attachments played from your hand onto Rohan characters cost 2 less.

 

Taking Initiative:  If the cost of the card is equal to or higher than the number of allies and attachments you control...

If you search a deck to win all quest in multiplayer and solo, ok: all cards here must be faqqed. But those decks are boring, you can build them even with only core.

 

In fact, the taking initiative deck (see above) can win all quest playing with another friend. It is a very powerfull deck: it can deal 2 damage to 1 enemy almost each round and ready all allies or characters in play sometimes.

Mndela, I'm trying really hard to not start a flame war here. But you are making it really hard.

 

What you doing is basically going into a Custom Card Topic and saying that creating cards is retard. Maybe for you, but let people have fun. You don't need to use those cards. I find most of the First Age cards bad, so I don't use then.

 

Your defense against this is pointless. Our FAQ will not be made official, your group of friends are not going to use this and the Devs couldn't care less about this. So this is for our groups, for our friends. This is to make more decks possible, to make more cards useful, to add variety and more fun. If you disagree. Cool, we all can see that. If you are not going to help, please, leave. You are only making us feel a huge dislike about you.

 

Anyone is free to come here and add suggestions, improve the suggestions of other, argue about balance, show some insight about card design, etc. Coming here and saying what you saying is basically being a bad person. One of those guys. Do you know those guys? Man, those guys...

Anyone has sugestions for the following cards. If possible, make it simple.


Ever My Heart Rises


Something to make it less of a niche "I win this specific quest" type of card.


Spare Hood and Cloak


Very hard to use. If you give it to a hero that sometimes doesn't have what to do in a round (like Fatty Bolger) and pass it to someone else, it is great. But then the hero that received is generally someone that is very busy (like legolas) and the Hood never moves on. Maybe someone that enlighten me about some deck that this card is great.


Keen-Eyed Took


What is this card for? Can someone enlighten me or give suggestions?


Yes but the errata could be by another way.


Sure, but taking it back as is don't resolve the problem. You need to change it someway. Maybe -1 cost helps (probably not).

> Keen-Eyed Took
>

It serves a few purposes:

 

1) Gives you knowledge of what is on top of your deck. This can be useful for something like Vilya or a card that relies on knowing what is coming next in your deck.

2) Allows you to get a card into the discard pile. Could be useful for things like Stand and Fight, Hidden Cache, etc.

3) Could allow players to "thin" their decks and get rid of their top cards if they don't seem too useful in the hopes that the next card will be better.

4) Pops an ally out of play in order to activate certain effects (Horn of Gondor, Imrahil, etc.)

 

That being said, there are better options out there for all of these purposes.

Hmm interesting second point.. I definitely agree that errata should only be used on cards that break the game or are overly powerful compared to everything else. This whole thread was what errata would you like to see and its mostly for fun because I would actually not want to see all mine or other people's errata suggestions become real because it would be way too confusing to remember what cards actually are.

I still wish many cards were slightly different to be more useful but as an LCG you're simply going to have weaker and stronger cards and the freedom of deck building let's you choose your decks power level which has many benefits and yes certain weak cards you do have to build a deck around but that can be fun.

And I must add it is nice having certain powerful cards like a dwarf swarm deck because if you really need to beat a quest its nice having the option to pull out your power deck. If all cards were equal you wouldn't be able to make those extra powerful decks or even a weaker deck for the purpose of your own fun creativity or the extra challenge.. so having a spectrum of weak and powerful cards is healthy for the game as long as they're not on the extreme ends of bad (The End Comes) or powerful (pre errata'd Erebor Battle Master).

So even though errata is only used when crucial its still fun to dream how certain cards could be better or to express why you think a card is OP which is the whole point of this thread.

## 101 [Catastrophic09 on July 12, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/109818-community-errata/?do=findComment&comment=1152398)

> Anyone has sugestions for the following cards. If possible, make it simple.

Ever My Heart Rises: I actually really enjoy this type of card that is very powerful but only works in certain decks but it does suck that it only works in certain quests.. so I would never change it.

Spare Hood and Cloak: yeah this card only usually gets one use from me in a round as I'll put it on say Eleanor and then if I don't use her ability its nice being able to ready someone else but then it always stays on them. Recently however I've noticed this card is nice to have around to soak up treacheries or shadow effects so instead of having to discard your Gondorian Shield you can get rid of the cloak that you have no use for anymore. It would be cool if the ability gave plus one defense making you want to use the cloak to ready someone and give them a defense boost.

## 102 [Mndela on July 12, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/109818-community-errata/?do=findComment&comment=1152449)

Ever My Heart Rises: after you travel to a location, if there are other locations in staging with the same trait, then.... as it follows ^^

 

Spare Hood and Cloak: even if you can give its only 1 use (the above example with Eleanor), it is good. It is like Cram at least then (Cram is for heroes, Cloak for everybody! Faramir, Gandalf, you wonder), and can be more efficient if you know how to play it. For example, with Strenght of Arms, and 1 chump ally has the cloak and he was exhasuted: so you can ready a hero after playing Strenght of Arms.

I find this topic to be a bit odd.

I would argue for an errata to the game for certain.

I feel that we would need to discuss the sort of design that we wanted though if you want to create a community errata with any value.

For instance a good point raised in this topic is that print errata isn't the same as in a computer game. If this was an online game we'd see a lot of errata on cards that didn't work quite right because it would cost the players nothing, and would only require a bit of time to fix.

Realistically though, you're just not going to see an errata to make Silverlode Archer slightly better to make it cost-effective compared to Ithilian Archer. In any case the argument that Ithilian Archer is just better isn't true - only the silverlode archer has the silvan trait.

The game has been moving towards increasing the importance of trait design since release (where it was clearly always intended to be) so when you look at cards you should keep that in mind.

This is why Lure of Moria is cheaper than Grim Resolve. 

Grim Resolve at 5 is basically the value of "ready all the characters available to the heroes without restriction."

Now as it happens from a balance point of view, Dwarfs ended up being one of the most powerful traits, so a card that is limited by only targeting them isn't really limited. Dwarfs have more cards than any other trait right now. However eventually the other traits will catch up (they already are starting too) so eventually this will be a meaningful restriction on the other players you play with.

It's really hard for the community to come up with errata because of this, we have no knowledge of the future design. However I think it's fairly clear that at least some kind of design guidelines exist about the future of traits we don't yet see much of.

As a result I would argue that the only errata we as a community can really argue for are the cards that are so stupidly strong as to be a design problem (Which is why I argued for errata on Unexpected Courage) or else cards that are so systemically weak that they will never be good.

Power in the Earth is often cited as an example of such a weak card. However rather than changing it there are two properties of it that we can exploit in a way that's more conducive to how card games work.

First we could create player cards which interact with attachments on locations - Maybe discard all locations with player card attachments from play (very strong), how about a hero that gets +1 willpower for every location in the staging area with an attachment. 

Now, Only four player cards exist which attach to locations, and only two of them aren't restricted in some way. However Power in the Earth is the only card which attaches to locations and which you then want to leave those locations in play. (Path of Need, and Ancient Mathom both want you to make the location active, thor's key is unique, you could argue you'd leave it's locaiton in play too I guess). 

An alternative is to look at the locations in the encounter deck, Power in the Earth would be worth a slot if you had some locations that it could nullify that were also horrid to get rid of. Think of East Bight (core set) without the forced text. That would be worth using Power of the Earth for, 1 cost would allow you to ignore this card forever and not have to quest through 6 points. 

Sadly it doesn't work in that case - and a quick look at the other threat 1 locations will find you a common theme, they're either beneficial to explore (e.g. Bee Pastures) or else have a horrible other effect to balance the low threat (e.g. Branching Paths). Which means that we still want to explore them.

However it wouldn't take a lot to design locations in future that power in the earth could deal with well - a 1 threat location that helped the player the more were in play would be ideal.

This kind of errata to weak cards is what you're more likely to see.

Resurrecting this thread a little bit, but I wanted to add that I houserule Steward of Gondor.  Instead of "Attached hero gains the Gondor trait" I play it as "Attach to a Gondor hero".  I find it to thematically build on the wealth of Gondor and it also removes one card from the list of cards that are auto-included in every deck.

Hi all,

 

I don't like the suggestions made of Blue Mountain Trader, despite I do agree this cards could need an errata.

 

Blue Mountain Trader: 
By exhausting him he becomes very similar to errand-rider which isn't something that great. I'd prefer if they just put a limit on it. I think limit 1 per round should be fine. I like to a have a new flexible ally (like the wandering took) and just as the wandering took this one has it's downside. Namely, it will cost you 1 resource if you want him. Next to that he still can be used for some resource movement. but that has became harder now.

 

Power in the earth:

Main reason I'don't like it is the Gladden Marshlands. It shouldn't be possible to kill 10 staging threat for 2 cost. But the card has gotten old and therefore I think a new mechanism could revive him more than an errata. Errata's are only there for cards that entered the scene unbalanced, they are not for reviving rarely used cards. I think the group of rarely used cards is that small that we shouldn't worry about it. Nonetheless a new location mechanism could help the card a little. 

 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Example:
 

threat: 1

quest points: X , where X is the number of characters in play.

 

text: At the end of the refresh phase deal 4 damage to a single hero.

 

Action: If "Card" has 0 threat,  then the first player can choose to add "Card" to the victory display.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

Maby little artificial but I think the idea is clear. 2 copies of this card in a quest could make it much more interesting.

 

Grtz

Disagree!!!

How could we ever play this game if Aragorn couldn't become Gondor ???

Well, I do make an exception for Aragorn.  Attach to a Gondor hero or Aragorn.

And what about Pippin? He "became Gondor", didn't he? :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

At this point gaining a trait (at least a supported one) is so strong that gaining the Gondor trait would be worth a card and 1 resource anyway. (It would be like Nor am I a stranger, for Gondor). Getting the best resource generation on top just makes the Gondor trait a trivial after thought, when it is good in its own right.

I think we'll get a card for that in 2017.  (Saga 5)
