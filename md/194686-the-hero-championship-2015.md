Introducing the Hero Championship 2015 edition!

 

I had a ton of fun during last year's championship, the community enjoyed the ally unique championship a few weeks back, and it seems that the community is ready to try this out again.

 

 

This year's tournament includes heroes added from the following expansions

- The Treason of Saruman

- The Land of Shadow

- The Lost Realm

- The Antlered Crown (Erkenbrand missed last year by days)
- The Angmar Awakens Cycle (Arwen just barely made the cut)

 

Since only one hero from The Grey Havens is spoiled and since the product is still weeks away, I opted not to include Cirdan

 

Seeding is based on last year's results with the new heroes being semi-arbitrarily/randomly added throughout the list.

 

Vote for your favorite hero as they enter their match-ups in the responses below. Vote on whatever criteria you desire - this is very informal. Feel free to campaign for you hero, criticize the seeding, and give your vote rationale. I really like the option of voting on the forums to encourage friendly banter and conversation.

 

Visit http://challonge.com/lotrhero2015 [http://challonge.com/lotrhero2015] for the bracket layout.

 

Each round is five days with voting closing at noon CST, with the exception of the first round which is only three days.

 

The 2015 Championship has concluded. Our winner is Sam Gamgee!

That's funny, I've built some fun decks recently with five of these six heroes!

A-Mirlonde

B-Glorfindel (Lo)

C-Dwalin

A: Mirlonde

B: Glorfindel (Lore)

C: Dwalin

 

Glorfindel (Lore) actually saw a decent amount of use in my progression through the game until my card pool grew.

## 6 [shosuko on November 30, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194686-the-hero-championship-2015/?do=findComment&comment=1912788)

A - Oin

B - Pippin (S)

C - Dwalin

 

Why?  Because solo play options.

 

Oin is a pick you can throw in a 2 spirit 1 tactics to balance out the resource production, or even put in a leadership + spirit dwarf deck to utilize Dwarven Axe and Dwarrowdelf Axe without swapping out a hero.  Since you have to deal with everything on your own in solo play, having leadership for Sneak Attack - Gandalf, and Steward of Gondor, and spirit for A Test of Will it can be tough to fit in the awesome weapons of the Dwarves.  Oin can play as a resource fixer to get these extra equip boosts without going 3 resource and gimping your early game.

 

Pippin also can fit for solo play.  When you're playing solo, especially with weak hobbits, you might consider to build a deck around keeping your threat super low while you use Ranger Bow and such to plink off enemies in the staging area.  Sometimes a deck will throw something at you that you just can't kill in 1 turn, but you also can't defend against properly with your set up.  Just push it back, finish it next turn, and you're on your way again.

 

Dwalin also gets some air time in solo play, where a lot of the game can be playing around your threat level and the engage cost of enemies.  Being able to cut your threat down for each orc you finish off can keep your threat low without cheesing cards like The Galadhrim's Greeting for easy mode.

 

Basically - when you want a sub par deck that has some options for solo play these characters can have their place.  The other half is just bad lol.

Thanks for running this again, Thanatopsis!

 

A - Mirlone - Mono-lore is a lot of fun and Oin is one of the worst Dwarves.

B - Glorfindel (Lore) - With the awesomeness of Lore Pippin and now the superiority of Spirit Merry, there is no reason to ever play Spirit Pippin.

C - Fatty - I never play either, but I'll take a Hobbit over a Dwarf.

Heh, I like this championship!

 

A - Mirlonde - purely because she's the one I play more

B - Glorfindel (Lore) - even at twice the threat, still more than twice the goodness

C - Fatty - because hobbit decks can synergise with him, to an extent. and I don't think I've built with Dwalin since he came out

Well, however the voting turns out I think all three of them are totally screwed with those matchps in the next round. That said, though:

 

A - Oin. This was the only difficult choice, because I do rather like both these heroes. The other two are no-brainers for me.

B - Glorfindel

C - Fatty

A - Mirlonde: the quintessential support hero. Not sure who your third lore hero should be but you;re nervous about threat? Pick Mirlonde

B - Pippin (S): Standing around with your hair blowing in the wind or sitting around fishing... either way, boring.

C - Fatty Bolger: the recent CotR meme contest solidified my dislike for Dwalin. Plus, I've always been a Fatty defender from the start: his ability is quite useful (especially now when paired with Spirit Merry

Thanks for doing this! My voting in the championship will be based mostly on the gameplay.

 

Mirlonde - she's not flashy, but I think she's actually good

Glorfindel - He has access to in-sphere Asfaloth, plus I cannot bear myself to vote against Glorfindel

Dwalin - I don't like either very much, but Dwalin could be good in certain quests, whereas I think Fatty is more or less worthless - and unexciting to boot.

A: Oin - he is a crux of my dwarves deck - giving me access to plenty of awesome tactics cards

B. Pippin (S)

C. Dwalin - don't really care for either of the choices here, but since I main with Dwarves, Dwalin it is since he'd be more likely to see play.

A: Mirlonde

B: Glorfindel (Lo)

C: Dwalin

 

I chose Mirlonde because she always fits in well in mono-Lore decks, which are often lots of fun. Doesn't do an awful lot, but quests for 2 in standard and Battle questing. I used Oin a few times but didn't like him. We rarely play dwarfs unless we play 2 fully dwarf decks together, so Oin isn't all that useful to us.

 

I chose Glorfindel because I think he's a strong hero and his relatively weak special ability is balanced by his extra progress with Asfaloth. Remove Spirit Glorfindel from the game and I'm sure you'd see a fair bit of Lore Glorf. Also, I've never used Spirit Pippin.

 

I chose Dwalin because he's OK in some quests and Fatty has never impressed me when I've used him.

A. Mirlonde - I love the art, and I've even used her in some situations. A good Hero, but not top notch.

B. Pippin (S) - Just because, come on! Look at him, he's lost in his thoughts of grandeur.

C. Dwalin - I love dwarves. Fat hobbits not that much.

Piece of Cake

 

A - Oín. Though I believe Mirlonde to be better, I like Dwarves and not Mirlonde. :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]
B - Glorfindel. The one true Glorfindel hero, he was one of my personal favorites in the Core Set days. 
C- Dwalin.

He was a great hero back in the day

Dwalin, today, he can only pray

For he will probably never see play

Orc trait only, you say?

The meta: 'aye,

we feed you other prey

to slay.'

Not only did the Orcs disappear

Other heroes are to us more dear

Fought for us he did, with prowess

Remains now powerless

Forever laid to bear

To never see again the air

-Dwalin, Son of Fundin

A: Óin


B: Glorfindel (Lo)


C: Fatty Bolger


 


I like Mirlonde, but Óin is an actual LotR character and I recently had success with him on a deck.


 


I almost went for Pippin, since his art is oh so great while Glorfindel's is rather sad (and why is he always too thin?), but Glorfindel is a great hero.


 


And finally Fatty, since there are way too many dwarves and not enough hobbits.


 


Cheers.

Yay!!! Hero championship is back!! Good on you for running it again Thanatopsis, after running the unique ally one I know that it does take a fair bit of work and time so good on you for sticking with it!

 

Still can't believe Galadriel took the title home last year instead of Elrond... highway robbery if you ask me!

 

Wow rough that some of these heroes have to fight to even get into the bracket! Fair enough though if they finished bottom 6 last year! I agree with others that they will get trounced within a round or two anyway though =P

 

A. Oin. Just never been a fan of mirlonde and have never used her or really even looked at her card for that long!

B. Glorfindel (Lo). Bad Art or no an awesome character and a decent hero. healing right out of the gate without any player cards can be **** useful
C. Dwalin even though hes awful. He is nowhere near as awful as Fatty. Not to mention Dwarves > Hobbits for me.

--- Round 2 ---

 

This is the big round. 64 heroes are reducing down to 32. Wow!

 

I’ve included a voting card (see below) that should help alleviate everyone re-typing everything. Just copy, paste, and delete whichever names you are not voting for.

 

There are some really fun match-ups this round. I’m especially looking forward to the Leadership versions of Boromir and Faramir duking it out.

D: Galadriel

E: Dain Ironfoot - He is so strong, it is astounding.

L: Aragorn (Lo) - Okay this one was really tough for me.  I have a fun little deck with Aragorn (Lo), Grima, and Hirluin so picking between Hirluin and Aragorn was tough.  Aragorn really makes the deck shine, though.  Outlands are just a bonus.

I think in your template you provided there is an error in T.  It should list Elrond and Glorfindel (Lo) but it currently lists Spirit Glorfindel.

D: Galadriel v Mirlonde - I do like Mirlonde, but Galadriel is a heavyweight.

E: Pippin (Lo) v Dain Ironfoot - I would normally protest vote against Dain anyway, but Pippin is my most used hero and I would vote for him at #1.

F: Glorfindel (S) v Théodred - I'm a little burned out on Glorfindel, but Theodred is outclassed by more recent leadership heroes.

G: Sam Gamgee v Ori - Sam is such a beast.  3 willpower with built in readying and can become a wall on defense.

H: Frodo Baggins v Beravor - I'm coming back around to Beravor a bit with the new Dunedain, but Frodo is such a nice safety blanket.

I: Beorn v Nori - Honour Guard is breathing new life into Beorn.

J: Éomer v Glóin - I'm surprising myself with this pick.  Gloin jank is a lot of fun, and Eomer has a lot of competition with Legolas, Aragorn, Hama, and Beorn.

K: Aragorn (Le) v Idraen - I'll take the free readying over the pay to ready.  Plus leadership Aragorn is probably the worst of the 3 versions.

L: Aragorn (Lo) v Hirluin the Fair - Nobody likes Outlands.

M: Prince Imrahil v Thalin - Thalin's ability just doesn't do enough against the newer quests.

N: Legolas v Brand Son of Bain - Legolas wins in so many ways, including vastly better art

O: Denethor v Gríma - Never really got into Grima or the doomed mechanic.  Denethor can be a great defender and his ability can change games.

P: Beregond v Bombur - Although I do kind of like Bombur.

Q: Merry (T) v Bard the Bowman - Bard really needs a new weapon attachment, otherwise he will always lose to Legolas or Haldir.

R: Haldir of Lorien v Dúnhere - Dunhere decks can be really fun, but most of the time he's pretty useless.

S: Mablung v Thorin Oakenshield - Mablung is becoming my most used tactics hero.  Versatile stats, good keywords, and amazing ability.

T: Elrond v Glorfindel (Lo) - Kind of burned out on Vilya, but Elrond's other aspects are still amazing.

U: Rossiel v Faramir (Lo) - Haven't actually used Rossiel yet, but I really want to try it.  Faramir will see even less play with his new Leadership version.

V: Merry (S) v Bilbo Baggins - Merry hasn't impressed me as much as I thought he would, but Bilbo is still pretty weak.

W: Bifur v Damrod - Bifur is a very good hero, but Damrod finally makes traps a thing.

X: Gandalf v Caldara - Played Gandalf once, and never will again.  Meanwhile Caldara decks are really fun and get even better with Sword Thain.

Y: Gimli v Halbarad - Not a big fan of either, but Halbarad fits in better with my Hobbit decks.

Z: Boromir (T) v Treebeard - I don't enjoy exploiting Boromir.  Treebeard hero can be a lot of fun with Elrond.

AA: Erestor v Balin - Erestor finally made my Gondor leadership deck purr.

AB: Éowyn v Dwalin - Yep

AC: Eleanor v Erkenbrand - Shadow cancellation is so good.  Eleanor seems to always lead to worse cards.

AD: Elrohir v Amarthiul - Looking forward to playing around with the Dunedain archtype.

AE: Aragorn (T) v Théoden (T) - Such a beast.  Tactics Theoden is outclassed by his new incarnation.

AF: Celeborn v Dori - 3 WP and the center of Silvan decks.

AG: Arwen Undomiel v Háma - Seems too early to vote for Arwen.  Plus Hama is awesome, if nothing else just to recycle Foe Hammer instead of a feint/thicket lock.

AH: Théoden (S) v Elladan - Takes Rohan to the next level

AI: Boromir (Le) v Faramir (Le) - Faramir has potential, but I haven't played him yet.  Meanwhile I've been enjoying the Gondor deck lately.

FInally it's back!!! So excited to do this again. So let's start.

 

D: Galadriel (Still one of the best heroes in this game. Still mad about her knocking out Legolas last year but clear winner against Mirlonde)

E: Pippin (Lo) (Actually tough one but I like my new Ent-Deck with Pippin Merry and Mablung, so Dain, sorry but your out!)

F: Théodred (I take every shot to eliminate Spirit Glorfindel from this competition :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] )

G: Sam Gamgee (Close again but I just see Sam as the better hero in this matchup)

H: Beravor (Beravor got new life with the Dunedain power in the new cycle. Nice to see that she gets played more again!)

I: Beorn (Big bad bear vs. dwarf... Hmm i think the bear will take that fight :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] )

J: Éomer (I really hope Eomer takes it this year. Such a good hero and so much fun to play!)

K: Aragorn (Le) (Since I am currently runnig a "Three Hunters" Deck for campaign mode, Aragorn is the clear winner in this matchup)

L: Aragorn (Lo) (Don't like the Outland mechanic that much, so Aragorn again)

M: Prince Imrahil (Imrahil has to be the winner here. Eomer and him is such a good combo when you have stuff leaving play!)

N: Legolas (Thats a no brainer. Legolas is so much better. Will be interesting to see how far he gets this year)

O: Denethor (Battle of the two anti-heroes here? :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] I don't play Grima ever so this one goes to Denethor)

P: Beregond (It's so sad but I have to vote against the dwarf again in here. No one passes the wall named Beregond in combat :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] )

Q: Merry (T) (Tough one but since Merry made it into my Entdeck he edges out Bard in this matchup)

R: Haldir of Lorien v Dúnhere (Haldir with Wingfoot is just so much more better then Dunhere at the moment so should be an easy win for him in this matchup)

S: Mablung (Again Thorin is just overplayed for me and Mablung with the new Dunedain mechanic and with Ents he is just to good to pass on to someone else)

T: Elrond (Clash of the high cost lore heroes clearly goes to Elrond. Glorfindels healing from the Coreset days is just too expensive)

U: Rossiel (Rossiel is fresh and fun to play where instead Faramir in his lore version is just not that good tbh)

V: Merry (S) (I'm not a huge fan f the spirit version from Merry but Bilbo is just not good for 9! starting thread)

W: Damrod (Since I play a trapdeck as support to the new dunedain fighting deck, Damrod clearly wins this matchup)

X: Gandalf (Caldara is so much better becazse..... Yeah ok Gandalf will stomp her in this fight :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] )

Y: Gimli (Thats close again and since I ruled out every dwarf to this point and since still like to load up Gimli in my Three Hunters deck je takes this fight!)

Z: Boromir (T) (Ouh let's see if Boromir manages to take this one. Tough first round opponent)

AA: Erestor (Still not sure if I like him or not but he is just fresh and new. Balin has seen to much play for me in the past)

AB: Éowyn (Come on Dwalin you know you can't win in thie matchup against the great lady of Rohan ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] )

AC: Erkenbrand (Interesting matchup here, both heroes have very usefull abilities but Erkenbrand has the better one!)

AD: Amarthiul (I really like his ability to be dual sphere. That gives him (at least for me) the edge ofer Elrohir)

AE: Aragorn (T) (We all know that Theoden (S) is so much more that kind of hero card everyone wished to have as Theoden. So get the tactic version out of here)

AF: Celeborn (What did Dori again? :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] )

AG: Arwen Undomiel (Is Arwen the "dark horse" in this years Championship race? I think she definetly has the potential to take a top spot in this tournament. With that kind of ally version there was great pressure on the hero card to be very good and I think FFG did really well here!)

AH: Théoden (S) (Now thats what I wanted to see as Theoden! Rohan royals with Theoden (S), Eowyn and Eomer is a really good deck)

AI: Faramir (Le) (The sons of Gondor in a first round clash! Nice! But Faramir wins this one because his ability is just better! Can't wait for the new Saga Expansion)

 

Really great to see this format come back this year again. Nice matchups in the first round some seem very onesided but let's see how this one turns out. Who do you think can make a suprise here? Without looking at the other posts until now I think Treebeard has the potential to upset Boromir in round 1 but we have to see.

Shout out to Thanatopsis for hosting this years event, really appriciate that!

Y: Halbarad

Z: Boromir (T). Toughest 1st-round choice! Treebeard is awesome too.

AA: Balin. Erestor changes the game, but that feeling of relief when you realize that Balin still has a resource after all is so very sweet.

This round I'm voting based on who I prefer to see on the table in front of me.

 

D - Galadriel

E - Pippin (Lore).  So splashable and with a super useful ability.

F - Glorfindel (Spirit). Mostly because I've never really enjoyed Theodred.

G - Sam, one of my favorite heroes, although Ori is stiff competiton.

H - Frodo

I - Beorn, a great 'solution' card for many aggressive scenarios.

J - Eomer

K - Idraen

L - Aragorn (Lore).  He enables many decks and shenanigans that could not exist otherwise.

M - Prince Imrahil

N - Legolas

O - Denethor, wow that's probably the toughest matchup of this round for me.  I love both.

P - Bombur

Q - Bard, another really tough matchup.  I've used Merry (T) a lot more but Bard is one of my favorites... he just doesn't fit into as many decks.

R - Haldir.  Haldir vs Dunhere?  Is this one really random? :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

S - Mablung

T - Elrond

U - Rossiel, the star of my favorite new type of deck

V - Merry (Spirit).  I really haven't used him very much, and although I have very fond memories of Bilbo, I'd like to try Merry in some newer decks

W - Damrod, awesome new hero.

X - Gandalf

Y - Gimli

Z - Treebeard

AA - Balin

AB - Eowyn

AC - Erkenbrand

AD - Amarthiul

AE - Theoden (Tactics), gotta love the underdog.  And I've had fun with him in some decks. He's pretty nice in Fog on the Barrow-downs

AF - Celeborn

AG - Arwen I suppose. I'm looking forward to trying her out.  For whatever reason, I have never been too interested in Hama recycle decks.

AH - Theoden (Spirit).  It's time for the Christmas spirit anyway.

AI - Faramir (Leadership).  Boromir vs Faramir.  The two Leadership brothers.... another intentional matchup??

---------------------------------------------

D: Galadriel. She didn't deserve the win last year in my opinion but is far better than Mirlonde who I did not even vote for to make the brackets. 

E: Pippin (Lo). This is a hard one... Lore Pippin is neat and far better than his useless spirit iteration but I much prefer dwarves to hobbits.... Dain is overpowered is a silly way though making dwarves far stronger than they should be as a faction so going to go with Pippin ultimately. 

F: Glorfindel (S). Glorfindel all the way! Whether he is a crutch or no I still enjoy using him and Asfaloth saves the day very often.

G: Sam Gamgee. Sam is a great hero, especially for his low threat cost and high willpower. 

H: Frodo Baggins. This one is also hard, don't use either of these heroes at all. Frodo has a great ability many are able to deck build around which is cool and he can be a great quasi defender (take threat instead of damage) whereas as powerful as Beravor is at the end of the day its just card draw which to me is sort of boring. Also I don't particularly like some of the FFG created characters.... namely the ones without a backstory and that were already used in a different game.... (yes im talking about Thalin, Caldara and Beravor). Others they have created since these three have been fantastic though.

I: Beorn. Nice and unique, nothing else need be said!

J: Éomer. Badass art and badass offensive hero.

K: Aragorn (Le). Not a big fan of Idraen.

L: Aragorn (Lo). Hirluin and outlands in general can get lost. Friends don't let friends play outlands. 

M: Prince Imrahil. More amazing art and a great hero. 

N: Legolas. Hahahaha brand is screwed in this matchup, this is the OG hero champion and for good reason. Great attacker with ranged from the get go and a progress maker with his ability. Pseudo quester and attacker, best of both worlds!

O: Denethor. Hate both these characters and don't really like either hero either. Many people love Grima and I understand how useful and powerful he can be but I never got into the doomed player cards and the tolkien nerd in me would hate playing with him as one of my heroes just knowing that in reality he ends up being a villain, one that is even given chances to redeem himself but refuses. Denethor is a decent defender and in lore and at least if someone really wants they could run Denethor, Faramir, Boromir which is pretty cool. Who are you going to run Grima with thematically? The Saruman hero we don't have yet and will potentially (and hopefully for me) never get? I guess you could run him with Rohan heroes.... but eh.... 

P: Beregond. The first hero I used that is completely dedicated to defending. Elrohir took his place a long time ago but I won't forget the fun I had with Beregond!

Q: Merry (T). Not a big fan of the hobbits but even less of a fan of Bard and Brand. Also tactics merry allows some pretty bonkers combos in multiplayer allowing for some pretty serious slaying of enemies. 

R: Haldir of Lorien. This match up is pretty funny, Dunhere is a poor mans Haldir. Haldir overtook Legolas as my favorite offensive hero when he came out. He can provide several free "feints" over the course of a game if your deck/s are built around getting the most out of his ability. Stopping several enemy attacks can be insanely beneficial and can keep your heroes and deck alive and still running! You can also more safety commit extra characters to questing or attacking (as opposed to defense) thanks to his ability. 

S: Mablung. Mablung seems to be a pretty pivotal hero for many decks these days thanks to his resource acceleration. Many have paired him with the new Dunedain heroes and strategies which works rather well. 

T: Elrond. Another harsh matchup, my boy Elrond got this one easy, I still think he should have won last year. Great stats, great abilities, can actually quest WITHOUT his ring  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] and can attack or defend like a normal useful regular hero. He was cheated I tell you!

U: Rossiel. Another great hero that is very unique. The whole victory display mechanic is really clever and seems like it would be fairly fun to play. I don't think she'll make it that far because the whole victory display deck is fairly niche. 

V: Merry (S). Haha gross, hobbit v hobbit. Definitely Merry all the way though, his spirit version is fantastic and is a good replacement for Glorfindel in many decks. Fantastic repeatable threat reduction, possibly the best we have so far. 

W: Damrod. An easy one, the fantastic new hero breathing new life into trap decks wins it hands down. 

X: Gandalf. Eugh this match up is just awful for me...... I hate the Gandalf hero and am a part of the small group that wishes he was never made but think Caldara is pretty **** useless. I get that in a deck built specifically around her ability she can be pretty **** good but you should not have to build an entire deck around one heroes ability, you do start off with 3 of them after all!!! Caldara is way too niche and not in a good way like Rossiel. Gandalf however is mega mega OP and trivialises most quests (especially when paired with other powerful heroes) and has too many attachments that only work for him that are all pretty much slightly OP on their own as well.... so ultimately as much as it pains me to do so I vote for Gandalf as it is better that a hero is OP than a coaster/almost a coaster because at least if they are overpowered they will see a fair bit of play, crappy heroes just sit in binders or boxes and never get taken out. 

Y: Halbarad. More heroes that don't exhaust to quest given certain circumstances is something I'd like to see more of for sure. 

Also being able to optionally engage a second enemy can be huge and pure combat decks can use this hero to great effect to keep the questing/support players pretty **** safe. Sam and Halbarad are great together as well as you can optionally engage two enemies with engagement high than your threat and double boost Sam this way.

Z: Boromir (T). Boromir is an absolute machine and an awesome hero, he can break the game with Blood/Fire decks however which to me is a little lame. Treebeard however does not match up to his ally version in my eyes however so going with Boromir with this one. 

AA: Erestor. Just a crazy hero with a crazy ability. Turns deck building completely on its head. Want a deck that uses up to 100 cards instead of 50 but is still viable? Bam, use Erestor and this is a thing. 

AB: Dwalin. No way Eowyn will lose this so may as well vote for lolz. Never liked Eowyn. The character herself, the art on this card, the ability. Some of the new Noldor discard mechanics and cards are really clever and well designed and also feature card recursion, drawing cards at times (rather than discarding) like Lindir for example and other cool abilities (playing from your graveyard, Erestors wacky ability etc) whereas Eowyn is just "discard a card to give +1 willpower". Boring and a waste of valuable player cards. I get that you can pump her hard and with any player and can power quest through by doing so but there are other ways to do this and she always just seemed so basic, boring and meh to me. Only one player can pump it but for 1 resource Protector of Lorien does more or less the same thing but can do so for willpower OR defense. Have never used her and probably never will. I hate discarding cards as you can probably tell...... 

AC: Erkenbrand. He is an awesome defender with a great ability. Eleanor is just a horrible design. Test of will is one of the strongest player cards in the game and its ability to cancel the when revealed effects of a card can be an absolute lifesaver or completely invaluable. Eleanor can do this every single turn... sure you have to exhaust her and sure you have to then reveal another encounter card but many quests that feature quite a few treacheries and rely on treacheries to do most of the damage to the player can just be shut down using Eleanor. Does she do anything else you ask? No her stats are all sucky even her 2 defense because she only has 3 hitpoints and is as fragile as a hobbit...  so she is both crazy good and really bad at the same time....  She is just test of will (except that you replace the card so not as good) on a hero that is repeatable every turn....  why not just create another cool card that does what test of will does but has stricter requirements or costs more to play or has an alternative cost (discard an ally, discard a card from your hand, deal 1 damage to a hero etc etc) and is in a different sphere. We literally have not seen anything else that can cancel when revealed effects all the way from the core set until recently when we got the door is closed. I think eventually we will see a third event or perhaps even an attachment or ally that can cancel when revealed effects through some other method. I think that this card should have been created shortly after the core set especially considering how nasty treacheries can be and how quite a few if not most cannot really be avoided or negated in any other way and Eleanor should have just not been created. I really don't like the three characters FFG created and simply ported from another LOTR themed game do I?  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

AD: Elrohir. I have a feeling Amarthiul will win this because he is new and shiny.... even though in reality he is pretty sucky and has possibly the worst art for any hero. I swear that art is a woman and was originally made for a female character. I reckon there was some sort of mix up and the artist didn't realise the character was meant to be male or that art was meant for another character originally, it just does not make sense. I have showed the card to my girlfriend a few times now (who does not play the game) and she agrees the card depicts a woman. thighs, waist, what look like breasts, even the face are all extremely feminine. 

I know it is a very mean thing to say but honestly if there was no mix up and that is what the artist gave FFG for Amarthiul's character I really hope FFG do not use that artist again for this game. 

Elrohir is my favorite defender by far and I think the better of the two brothers and severely underrated. Many many times I have blocked several especially nasty attacks in one turn and come out completely unscathed thanks to Elrohir. In fact he does it in most games if you use him right. So few people seem to use the brothers which is such a shame to me. I hope the new Arwen hero prompts more people to use them even if I don't think she goes as well as she could with them. 

AE: Aragorn (T). The art for Theoden is EPIC but he isn't for me and I prefer Aragorn's "scorpigorn" ability. 

AF: Celeborn. Dori's ability is as bad as Amarthiul's art. Enough said.

AG: Arwen Undomiel. The Hama - Lock is a pretty sweet combo but the new Arwen hero has a fantastic (albeit simple) ability and great art. Another 3 willpower hero with a relatively low threat cost is pretty nice as well I must admit. 

AH: Elladan. Go Twins! (or really just go Elrohir because secretly I wish I could replace Elladan but keep Elrohir's 3 defense... where are the new versions of both of them already?!)

AI:Faramir (Le). Move aside Treebeard, make way for the KING OF THE ENTS!

D: Galadriel. Not close

E: Pippin (Lo). Quality low threat heroes are rare and valuable. It is brutal voting against Dain, but Pippen is one of my all time favorites.

F: Glorfindel (S). The only reason to vote for Glorfindel is hate, seriously.

G: Sam Gamgee. A vote for Sam is a vote for Bill the Pony.

H: Frodo Baggins. Probably the most interesting and fun ability in the game, and powerful too.

I: Nori. My favorite Dwarf hero.

J: Glóin. Combotastic.

K: Aragorn (Le). Idrean is a great hero, but Aragorn is just better. People say he is the worst version, but in purple 1 resource a turn is nothing and with same sphere Sword that was Broken, this guy is way underrated.

L: Aragorn (Lo). A candidate for most powerful hero in the game.

M: Prince Imrahil. Both are meh, the Prince less so.

N: Legolas. Still good.

O: Gríma. He makes three color solo decks totally workable.

P: Beregond. Best defender in the game. If you think honor guard is improving Beorn, honor guard makes this guy invincible.

Q: Merry (T). Quality low threat hero. His biggest flaw is 2 wp on a red hero and you don't want him to quest!

R: Haldir of Lorien. In the matchups of staging area attackers Haldir is just better.

S: Mablung. He is like T Boromir, but without the guilt.

T: Elrond. Never lose a single character? Check.

U: Faramir (Lo). Finally, Ents have a tribal leader with synergy. Oops, I mean... I have not been impressed with Rossiel (and she has green skin)

V: Bilbo Baggins. They are both disappointing, Bilbo slightly less so (in solo).

W: Damrod. Traps are still useless in multiplayer, but this guy rocks solo.

X: Gandalf. Clearly a beast. I don't get the hate for this guy. He is fun because he dramatically transforms you play style. 0 cost cards and events in general are suddenly really good.

Y: Gimli. I think both are difficult to make work, but Gimli is more fun. I like how Gimli's ability is thematically connected to Gloin's ability. Like father...

Z: Boromir (T). Treebeard is good, but not "needs a nerf" good.

AA: Erestor. Radically different play style? Check.

AB: Éowyn. I'm actually a huge fan of Dwalin, but it's Eowyn.

AC: Erkenbrand. This is the only defender that competes with Beregond. He is so fun.

AD: Elrohir. Slight edge.

AE: Théoden (T). Rohan is my favorite tribe and this guy makes them good.

AF: Celeborn. It is tough to vote against Dori, but Celeborn is a powerhouse.

AG: Háma. Arwen looks amazing, but she went up against my personal all time favorite.

AH: Elladan. Both twins get my vote.

AI: Faramir (Le). Finally, Ents have a tribal leader with synergy. Wait, didn’t I say this already?

F: Glorfindel (S) : Because he is still among the best


G: Sam Gamgee : His stats and ability make for a very strong hero


H: Frodo Baggins : I like Beravor and use her on my Dunedain decks, but Frodos ability is very strong and can be a saver 


I: Beorn : I like him more


J: Éomer : Eomer when used on a Rohan deck with his attachments can be deadly


K: Idraen : I will vote for Loragorn, so here I stand for Idraen


L: Aragorn : Loragorn is one of my best heroes 


M: Prince Imrahil : Never used him yet, but I find he might be of use


N: Legolas : Brand is no much for the elf


O: Denethor : I believe Denethor is still a solid defensive hero who also has a nice ability


P: Beregond : Beregond is the master of defence


Q: Merry (T) : Cause I use him in all my Hobbit decks and can be really powerfull


R: Haldir of Lorien : Find him more usefull


S: Thorin Oakenshield : Very strong dwarf hero


T: Elrond : One Glorfindel is enough

W: Damrod : His ability is close to what I would like in my ranger decks

Assorted comments:

E is a tricky battle, but in the end Pippin's abilities are just so much fun.

H was really hard! Both are excellent heroes. In the end I went with Frodo because a Spirit hero who covers defence is a bit more exciting than a lore hero that covers draw.

I: Nori is my favourite Spirit dwarf and I like Spirit, sorry Beorn!

K is a funny matchup between Aragorn and Not Quite Aragorn.

M: A close contest decided because there's nothing as gratifying as seeing an Encounter card be insta-killed by Thalin!

O: I have a soft spot for Denethor, he was probably my most used hero in the first two cycles, but is gathering dust these days, poor fellow.

Q: Argh, two cool Tactics heroes! Bard wins because I like defence-lowering shenanigans.

R: Clash of the Staging Area Attackers! Haldir is better!

U: Haven't used Rossiel yet and Faramir (Lo) is underrated.

X: we have two heroes that really change your approach from normal, I went with Caldara because a Caldara deck is completely different to any other deck I have used.

 

Probably Elladan and Elrohir should be combined into one hero for this championship...

> Just throwing it out there cause it looks like a lot of work currently, isn't there a way in challonge that you could use the predictions feature as votes?

 

A lot of work for me? Nah, I have a good system worked out.

 

A lot of work for the voters? This is what I feared leading up to the start of the event.

Last year we had 54 heroes and the size of the early ballots was reasonable. Our current round with 32 match-ups is large and perhaps work intensive for each voter. I have not received any feedback as such, but I do want to keep participation accessible and not burdensome. Next year, with potentially 80+ heroes, things will need to be different.

 

However, I'm really torn about automating this contest.

- Several people love posting / reading commentary about the voting.

- It brings the community together into one thread, instead just going to another site to vote - and then reading off results.

 

Here's the plan: Sometime next year we'll start a thread up about how to balance both functionality and community building for the 2016 championship.

Yeah, I really like having the thread to see everyone's opinions.  Also it keeps people from voting more than once.

 

One thing you could do is have some of the top heroes get one or more rounds of byes.  Like some tournaments with, say, 64 teams don't even have the top seeds play until the top 8 or top 12.  That would limit the number of matchups per round (maybe 16 or 24 max) and allow for fewer blowouts.

D: Galadriel: almost as ubiquitous as Spirit Glorfindel now

E: Pippin (Lo): Pippin has two useful abilities and his low threat makes him easy to slot into multiple decks

F: Glorfindel (S): I like Theodred, but as tired as I get of Sp Glorfindel, I can't vote against him this early on

G: Sam Gamgee: Just an awesome hero and he makes it into every campaign I play.

H: Beravor: She's getting more play again because of the Dunedain.

I: Beorn: I like Nori, but the bear takes it here

J: Éomer: Will COTR's love carry Gloin through several rounds?  Maybe, but not on my ballot.

K: Idraen:  Very tough decision, but I like Spirit better than Leadership so I'll give Idraen the nod

L: Aragorn (Lo): Easy decision.

M: Prince Imrahil:  Poor Thalin, his ability just doesn't cut it anymore.

N: Brand: I prefer Legolas' ally version to his hero version. 

O: Gríma: Such a useful hero, and with more ways to draw tons of cards and lower your threat, he's just getting better.

P: Beregond: Still a great defender.

Q: Bard the Bowman: My favorite art in the game.

R: Haldir of Lorien: A rich man's Dunhere.

S: Mablung: Really bumps a lot of Tactics decks up to the next level.

T: Elrond: I like Lore Glorfindel, but Elrond.

U: Rossiel:  Victory display deck is the best thing that came out of this cycle.

V: Merry (S): Gives new life to secrecy.

W: Bifur: Haven't played Damrod yet, so I'll give the nod to the utility dwarf.

X: Gandalf: I like both heroes and hate having to vote one out now, but I'll take Gandalf for the sheer amount of creativity you can incorporate in a deck with him.

Y: Gimli:  Got some new life with Firefoot and dwarven attachment decks.

Z: Boromir (T): I like Treebeard, but Boromir is too good.

AA: Erestor: Again, Balin is good, but Erestor gives you whole new ways to play the game.

AB: Éowyn: Still the best quester.

AC: Eleanor: Erkenbrand is very good, but I've needed Eleanor on the table during this cycle.  There are so many game-ending, table flipping treacheries in these quests that Eleanor has kept me sane and in the game.

AD: Elrohir: Best defender in the game, even if he comes with his brother as baggage.

AE: Aragorn (T): Get over here!

AF: Celeborn:  Silvan Deck Cornerstone vs. Marginally Useful Defender. Hmmmmmmm.

AG: Arwen Undomiel:  Hama is good, but Arwen looks like a game changer.

AH: Théoden (S):  Makes Rohan decks viable.

AI: Faramir (Le): Really good in Ent decks.

D: Galadriel - I like Mirlonde but there's no contest here.
E: Pippin (Lo) - Pippin's great in a lot of contexts, Dain is Dwarves only (And I don't tend to play Dwarves).
F: Théodred - Still useful, and Glorfindel's boring.
G: Sam Gamgee - See what I said about Pippin.
H: Frodo Baggins - I like Beravor, but Frodo's such a potent defensive solution.
I: Beorn - See Pippin again. And Beorn is just fantastically fun.
J: Glóin - Don't often play either, but the complexities of getting Gloin to work are incredibly satisfying.
K: Idraen - Least favourite Aragorn vs. one of my favourite Spirit heroes.
L: Aragorn (Lo) - One of my favourite Lore heroes vs. Outlands.
M: Thalin - Imrahil may be objectively better, but building around direct damage effects is fun.
N: Brand Son of Bain - Legolas is pretty much guaranteed to win this one, but I retain an inordinate fondness for Brand.
O: Gríma - Cost reduction is just really good
P: Beregond - Bombur is underrated, but Beregond blows him out of the water
Q: Merry (T) - Powerful attacker in a Hobbit deck, or enabling chaingun attacks in combat decks. Bard just can't match up.
R: Haldir of Lorien - I really enjoy my Dunhere deck, but on the flipside Haldir is more versatile and fits into a greater variety of decks.
S: Mablung - See Pippin again...
T: Elrond - Corefindel just doesn't hold up well whereas Elrond is super powerful.
U: Rossiel - I'm actually more positive about Lore Faramir than a lot of people, but I find Rossiel more interesting.
V: Merry (S) - Bilbo is overcosted, whereas Merry sorts out threat reduction single-handed.
W: Damrod - I haven't actually used Damrod at all yet, but I really enjoy traps, so I'll pick him over Bifur.
X: Caldara - Caldara is way under-rated, I love to root for underdogs, and my Caldara deck has served me well against multiple Nightmare quests.
Y: Halbarad - Gimli is fun, but I like the Dunedain.
Z: Treebeard - I don't use either very much, but Treebeard interests me more in theory.
AA: Balin - I know Erestor is really good, but I've yet to make a deck with him that really works for me, whereas Balin has been a big favourite of mine for a while now.
AB: Éowyn - This shouldn't require explanation.
AC: Eleanor - The choice I struggled with the most, as I think both are great heroes, but in the end, I get screwed over by treacheries more often than shadow effects, so Eleanor wins.
AD: Amarthiul - I acknowledge that the elf-twins are very good and I definitely should use them more than I have done, but Amarthiul is shiny and new, and again, I like the Dunedain.
AE: Aragorn (T) - Tactics Theoden, while not as bad as he's sometimes reckoned to be, can't really match up to Scorpagorn.
AF: Celeborn - Again, should not require explanation.
AG: Arwen Undomiel - Hama never interested me, and Arwen is the new hotness.
AH: Théoden (S) - Really makes Rohan work, while Elladan is the less useful of the twins.
AI: Faramir (Le) - Boromir helps with some decent Gondor decks, but Faramir let me build this [https://wardenofarnor.wordpress.com/2015/08/25/deck-hasten-the-ents/].

I've been having some fun with Dwarf decks lately, but somehow I still ended up voting against most of them anyway.

 

Looks like I'm pretty enamored with the new and shiny--I wonder if I will feel the same about all of these heroes when I've had a little more time to get to know them. Interestingly enough, I've also been finding myself enjoying the Core heroes again--something about the new player cards has rejuvenated a lot of them for me.

Me too actually, they've become more fun as the 'discard from your deck' aspect becomes more and more of a thing.  I broke out the dwarves for Treachery of Rhudaur and had a blast digging through my deck.  I hope we get more cards like Well-Equipped, "risk for reward" type of cards, or some more like Hidden Cache that provide windfall benefits when you manage to discard them.

I voted for her, I've never been a fan of Galadriel. Mirlonde fits into an Elrond deck I'm very fond of. On a related note, Galadriel got the "new and flashy" vote last year to beat my favorite hero for the championship, so...  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Yeah she totally won because she was flashy and new. She can't even attack, defend or quest for goodness sake  ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

Elrond on the other hand is a total badass, healing buffs for everyone, pays for allies of any colour, dope stats.

D: Galadriel - I like Mirlonde a lot, but Galadriel is one of my favorite heroes. Sad to see the 'nameless she-elf' go though.

E: Pippin (Lo) - Weren't it for Pippin, 50% of the decks I make wouldn't be possible, and I can't play with Dain anyway in MP 'cause he's too good so he makes things boring.

F: Glorfindel (S) - Oh, uhm. Theodred is one of my favorite Leadership heroes, especially for 2-player games. Glorfindel is Glorfindel. Uhm. I guess I still can't bear myself to vote against one of the mighty of the Firstborn. At least not twice.

G: Sam Gamgee - Bye Ori, no regrets.

H: Beravor - I love Beravor, probably because I'm a draw-junkie.

I: Beorn - Roar! I love the character, and he's a very good hero too, especially when the setup puts a lot of pressure on the players. A shame Shadows have gotten so bad lately..

J: Éomer - I've never been a fan of Gloin, while I really enjoyed Eomer when I started playing.

K: Idraen - Aragorn (Le) is good, but I'd rather have the Lore version. Idraen makes an appearence in almost all of my multi-tasking Spirit - Lore decks, she's especially good combined with Glorfindel and Asfaloth.

L: Aragorn (Lo) - So good. Not a fan of Outlands either, I don't think they really are that good. One can abuse Loragorn, but there are also plenty of decks one can build using his strengths while not having the feeling you're exploiting the game, you just need to stay away from Doomed cards.

M: Thalin - He enables an archetype, and a very fun one.

N: Legolas - :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]. Am I supposed to justify this?

O: Gríma - He is awesome. He is so good in Solo decks! I really can't see how one could put him on par with Denethor.

P: Beregond - I do not love him, but Bombur is even more boring.

Q: Bard the Bowman - I don't really like 3 ATK hobbit nonsense, not to mention the absurd combos Merry (T) can be part of.

R: Haldir of Lorien - My favorite hero. Amazing art, amazing ability. Love the character too.

S: Mablung - I like his ability.

T: Elrond - If Vilya were a bit more consistent I would like him better, but his healing ability alone is worth it in big MP games, or with Treebeard.

U: Rossiel - Not too stoked by her, but I like Faramir even less.

V: Merry (S) - He's a beast. He makes Secrecy decks so much better, almost enabling the archetype all on his own.

W: Bifur - This is so difficult! I like both. I'm going with Bifur because he fits in a much wider range of decks.

X: Gandalf - Istari. He is in one of the decks I'm going to use after everything else has failed. Or when I just want to make the ecnounter deck look miserable. Middle Earth's saviour. Play him. Play him! :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Y: Gimli - Gimli can be a lot of fun. I hope new cards will make me love Halbarad more though.

Z: Treebeard - Super tough matchup. I like both characters. I Love both heroes. Treebeard gets the vote because Boromir always feels like abusing the game to me, but it was hard.

AA: Erestor - More interesting.

AB: Éowyn - She's 4 WP. Boring, but so **** effective. Dwaling is usable only in a handful fo quests.

AC: Erkenbrand - One of the best heroes in the game for me, and by far the best defender.

AD: Amarthiul - Let's give him a chance.. Hmm..

AE: Aragorn (T) - He's bonkers. I'm not much into Rohan, and find Theodred to be a waste - he's got so much stuff he can use but he still feels too weak for me.

AF: Celeborn - Had to Google 'Dori Hero' 'cause I've already forgotten he exists. 'nuff said.

AG: Arwen Undomiel - She looks awesome. AWESOME. I've never been a big fan of Hama either - if you take a look, under the voice 'good Tactics heroes' you can clearly read 'abuse game mechanics' as the definition. I don't like it. Well, to each his own.

AH: Theoden - I don't like Theoden's spirit version either but Elladan always struck me as uninteresting and the worse of the Twins. Things will change with Arwen and the new attachments, but I'm not really sure it will be enough for him to become interesting.

AI: Faramir (Le) - Faramir (Le) is much more interesting to play with.

All three Aragorn heroes are moving on
Only one dwarf hero, Gimli, made it out of this round.

 

There were several cases where higher seeded trounced their competition (Galadriel, Éowyn, and Beregond each only had two votes against them). And poor, poor Dori, didn’t get a single vote against Celeborn.

AJ: Galadriel: Honestly really don't like either of these heroes, but Pippin has no business taking out Dain!
AK: Glorfindel (S): Never been fond of Sam.
AL: Frodo Baggins: I quite like Frodo and his ability.
AM: Éomer: I like Eomer more right now simply because I am really interested in making a Rohan deck with him in it.  Leadership Aragorn is still really strong, though.
AN: Aragorn (Lo): Lore Aragorn is so great, allowing for some very fun high threat or doomed-based decks.
AO: Gríma: I think this is a really tough choice.  Legolas provides much needed location management in a sphere that otherwise lacks it.  Grima also loses out on usefulness as you add more and more players, but in the end Grima's ability is a lot more fun to me and Legolas has been around for quite a while.
AP: Beregond: Beregond wins this one for me easily.  Whenever I use hobbits they just die to things that deal direct damage [the obvious exception being Frodo, of course!]
AQ: Mablung: I quite like Haldir's ability, but I have had a much easier time building successful decks with Mablung.  His ability can generate 2-3 resources per turn easily in some scenarios.
AR: Elrond: Elrond is just a powerhouse having 3 insanely useful abilities (Vilya being one)
AS: Damrod: I like Damrod's ability a lot, even though I think Merry might be more useful.  But Merry is a non-Frodo hobbit, so meh, he will probably just die.
AT: Gimli: I don't really like either of my choices here.  Gandalf totally ruins Sneak Attack Gandalf combo and despite being strong, I think is best suited for solo play.  Gimli has been quite useful during my progression through the game, but unfortunately other decks that fill similar roles just outclass any Gimli deck I've made.
AU: Boromir (T): Just plain strong.
AV: Éowyn: My appreciation for willpower manipulation during questing cannot be overstated.
AW: Amarthiul: While I don't have much experience with Amarthiul, the ability is just so strong.
AX: Arwen Undomiel: Haven't really gotten on the Silvan train and Arwen just looks so good to me.
AY: Théoden (S):  I really like both of these, but I am looking forward to making a Rohan deck soon.

AJ: Galadriel v Pippin (Lo) - Very pleased to see him crush Dain.  Keep it going and dethrone Galadriel!  Just so much versatility and his card draw is the best in the game outside of maybe Erestor.
AK: Glorfindel (S) v Sam Gamgee - Built in readying is so good.
AL: Frodo Baggins v Beorn - Two very nice safety blankets on defense.  I'll go with the one that can handle bigger enemies.
AM: Éomer v Aragorn (Le) - Almost no reason to use Leadership Aragorn anymore.
AN: Aragorn (Lo) v Prince Imrahil - Tough call, but I'll go with Imrahil's readying.  Not a big fan of exploiting threat and doomed with Aragorn.
AO: Legolas v Gríma - Legolas is still arguably the best attacker in the game.
AP: Beregond v Merry (T) - Tactics Merry is pretty much just there to break the game.  Meanwhile Beregond is tied with Erkenbrand for the best defender in the game.
AQ: Haldir of Lorien v Mablung - Mablung makes tactics so splashable and he combos with so many heroes.  Haldir is also great, but haven't used him much lately.
AR: Elrond v Rossiel - Pretty sure Elrond will crush this one, but I'll give a support vote to the victory display mechanic.
AS: Merry (S) v Damrod - Merry is my 4th favorite Hobbit while Damrod single-handedly makes traps a thing.
AT: Gandalf v Gimli - Protest vote against Gandalf
AU: Boromir (T) v Erestor - I'm really enjoying Erestor.  There are so many deck possibilities with him.
AV: Éowyn v Erkenbrand - Eowyn is still the best questing hero in the game, but I do love shadow cancellation.
AW: Amarthiul v Aragorn (T) - Such a wrecking ball.
AX: Celeborn v Arwen Undomiel - Still think it's a bit early for Arwen.  Celeborn makes Silvan a thing.
AY: Théoden (S) v Faramir (Le) - Faramir might be good, but haven't tried him yet.  Meanwhile Theoden is one of my most played heroes.

Interesting First Round matchups. Pippin knocking out good old Dain was kind of unexpected at least for me. No love for the dwarfs anymore :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] Look how many dwarf heroes we lost in the first round!

All right then let's go for round 2!

 

AJ: Galadriel (It was a big W for Pippin to knock out one main hero af a big deck archetype, but he has no chance against the 2014 Hero champion here)
AK: Sam Gamgee (Sam is such a good hero, hope he can manage to knock our this pescie Spirfindel)
AL: Beorn (Bear vs Hobbit?! Frodo will thread out himself with this abiliy in this matchup)
AM: Éomer (Two great man, hard to call but I still give Eomer the edge in this one. Such a class when it comes to pure attackpower)
AN: Prince Imrahil (And again I would take the Imrahil Eomer Combo over these two Aragorn hero versions)
AO: Legolas (Thats not even close. Don't be mad Grima ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] )
AP: Beregond (Tough one here but I vote for the wall!)
AQ: Haldir of Lorien (Both really good Wingfoot targets but Haldir can muster more value in the combat phase then Mablung. This ones a real 51:49 for me)
AR: Rossiel (Another clash of deck archetyps. I like the new and shine one better, so Rossiel in this one!)
AS: Damrod (I don't know what it is but I can't get behind the new spirit Merry...)
AT: Gimli (Such a hard choice again! Since Gimli is the last dwarf left, I will root for him. Hope he can pass Gandalf in this matchup)
AU: Boromir (T) (So close for Boromir in the last round, who would have thought that! I think he will go out here but I still vote for him in this matchup)
AV: Éowyn (Pls Erkenbrand, I know you're good and I like you but be a gentelman and step aside for the lady of Rohan!)
AW: Aragorn (T) (since I voted against Aragorn in his past two matchups, I have to give this vote to him. No Aragorn in the next round would be to harsh)
AX: Arwen Undomiel (Arwen vs Aragorn future rounds?! You bet I want that matchup!)
AY: Théoden (S) (Another close one but I think Theoden can pull more weight with his new toys then Faramir does)

 

Interesting round here. Some very close matchups, let's see what the people will vote for (Go Sam!).

AJ: Galadriel v Pippin (Lo) - I don't own Galadriel yet (even though I know what she can do :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]) and I love Pippins low threat and card draw.
AK: Glorfindel (S) v Sam Gamgee - The hardest decision for me this round. I love Glorfindel since I firs saw him (well and light of Valinor :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]), but it's not any different with Sam, who has the rare 3 willpower on a Leadership hero + readying in combination with stat boosting.
AL: Frodo Baggins v Beorn - Easy decision for me, I like a Loraragorn, Frodo Deck that just takes a beating and sokes it up with Frodo jsut to go back to normal after you have set up your allies (or the other Players have :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png])
AM: Éomer v Aragorn (Le) - I love my allies and want to keep them all!
AN: Aragorn (Lo) v Prince Imrahil - Imrahil is cool, bur Loragorn is cooler^^
AO: Legolas v Gríma - Grima Needs more love :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]
AP: Beregond v Merry (T) - Beregonds strong defense isn't strong enough to compete with the crazy bloodbath merry and another strong attacker can bring over your enemies with the help of 1 or 2 hitches :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]  
AQ: Haldir of Lorien v Mablung - Tatics doesn't offer that much ressource generation, while Haldir all in all isn't that special.
AR: Elrond v Rossiel - A Powerhouse vs an interesting Card. Powerhouse wins.
AS: Merry (S) v Damrod - Don't like traps to much.
AT: Gandalf v Gimli - I'm not a dwarf fan and it is no shame for our last dwarf to go out against the Grey Wizard.
AU: Boromir (T) v Erestor - This was a close one, but Erestor's deckbuilding possibilities made the difference
AV: Éowyn v Erkenbrand - Go, go, go My Core-Set-questing-love :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
AW: Amarthiul v Aragorn (T) - Love both, but only one can go on. And I am hoping that at least 2 Aragorns will meet^^
AX: Celeborn v Arwen Undomiel - Arwen is good, but Celeborn pretty much enables a silvan deck AND has 3 willpower, what is really rare in Leadership.
AY: Théoden (S) v Faramir (Le) - For Gondor! (No fan of the Rohan ally discarding)

AJ: Galadriel - I love Pippin but he can't match up to the Lady of the Wood.
AK: Sam Gamgee - Down with the overpowered nonsense! All glory to the gardener!
AL: Beorn - First really difficult decision. Frodo is probably th better hero, but I have more fun with Beorn.
AM: Aragorn (Le) - Versatility wins for me, even though I don't use Leadership Aragorn too much at this point.
AN: Aragorn (Lo) - The threat reset is just too good.
AO: Gríma - Cost reduction is super powerful and uncommon, whereas there are plenty of options for good attacking heroes.
AP: Beregond - Merry does some crazy stuff, but Beregond is just so reliable.
AQ: Mablung - Haldir requires keeping everyone's threats down and powering him up. Mablung just enables so many power plays just by being there.
AR: Elrond - I love the idea of Rossiel and the victory display stuff, but I've yet to build a deck with her that I'm totally happy with, whereas Elrond features in multiple decks that I'm very happy with.
AS: Merry (S) - Haven't built a Damrod/Trap deck yet, whereas Merry's ridiculously good threat reduction enables my Dunhere deck, as well as being a big help to a bunch of others.
AT: Gandalf - Gimli was a beast back in Core Set days, but as fun as it is to pump him up, it's not as impressive as a Gandalf deck.
AU: Erestor - Both have the potential for some pretty insane power, but I find Erestor the more interesting of the two.
AV: Erkenbrand - Eowyn is still so ubiquitous, one can get bored of her, whereas Erkenbrand is incredibly useful but sometimes overlooked.
AW: Amarthiul - After the initial lustre wore off, I haven't found myself that enthused about Tactagorn to be honest, and he doesn't fit so well into the general Dunedain playstyle, whereas I think Amarthiul is going to be amazing in that context.
AX: Arwen Undomiel - Silvans are great, but again I go for versatility, plus Arwen is shiny and new and exciting.
AY: Faramir (Le) - Have yet to build a really good Rohan deck with Theoden, whereas Faramir as previously noted enables crazy shenanigans with Ents. At some point I'll build another deck with him, applying his ability to different allies, but just that one deck is enough to win him a lot of matchups in my book.

AJ: Galadriel: A more difficult decision than I thought.  I'll take Galadriel though because she allowed me to pull Spirfindel out of so many decks.
AK: Sam Gamgee:  At this point in the game, Sam is a better hero (drops mic).
AL:  Beorn: Lots of fun things to use in a Beorn deck now.
AM: Aragorn (Le): Still really good and has Sword that was Broken in his sphere, unlike the other Aragorns.
AN: Aragorn (Lo): Tough call, because both are good.  I'll take Strider because of his utility in Doomed decks.
AO: Gríma:  Grima's ability continues to become more useful, while Legolas' ally version has a better ability than the hero.
AP: Beregond: Defensive powerhouse vs. Hobbit powerhouse.  I'll take Gondor because I love the faction.
AQ: Mablung: Makes mono-Tactics decks awesome.
AR: Rossiel: Elrond's great, but I've had a lot of fun with the victory display deck.
AS: Merry (S): Repeatable threat reduction wins.
AT: Gandalf: OP?  Probably.  But still fun.
AU: Erestor:  One hero makes the game boring because of how good he is at combat.  The other makes the game interesting because he plays it like no other.
AV: Erkenbrand: Hard to vote against Eowyn, but Erkenbrand's ability is really valuable.
AW: Aragorn (T): Let all three Aragorns advance!
AX: Celeborn:  Tough call.  Intrigued by the potential of Arwen, but will give the vote to Celeborn: keeping the Silvan trait awesome since the Ringmaker cycle
AY: Théoden (S):  The best deck you can build with Theoden is Rohan centric.  The best deck you can build with Faramir is Ent centric.  I rest my case.

Eugh Amarthiul over Elrohir? New and shiny wins out again.... Time to vote for whoever is up against Amarthiul each round until he/she is eliminated!  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

 

---------------------------------------------
AJ: Pippin (Lo). Pure spite vote because Galadriel should not have won against Elrond last year.
AK: Sam Gamgee. Oooft this one is hard!!!! Both are three willpower low threat cost, action advantage heroes. Glorfindel is better at lower threat with better stats and access to Asfaloth (light is like his versions of Sam's ability) so in my opinion he is strictly better. He is however a complete crutch because of Asfaloth and how stupidly incomparable any other location focused player card is to Asfaloth. I truly hope one day we get Asfaloth mark 2 that has nothing to do with Glorfindel and so for this reason I vote for Sam
AL: Beorn. Never used or felt the need to use Frodo's ability. Why not just use a proper defender?
AM: Éomer. Dope art and an awesome offensive character.
AN: Aragorn (Lo). Used to rely heavily upon his threat reduction. Great hero and is a key part of making a deck with higher starting threat or using doomed player cards etc He will also be pretty great for the valour keyword allowing you to get off all your valour triggers then reset back to a lower threat.
AO: Legolas. Another joke match up. Original hero championship champion vs traitor who raises everyones threat.
AP: Beregond. Going to go with Beregond, guy is an absolute wall.
AQ: Haldir of Lorien. One of my favorite heroes and my favorite offensive hero
AR: Elrond. Elrond deserves another shot at the title... robbed I tell you!
AS: Merry (S). New spirit merry is great and as fantastic as Damrod is traps are still not viable in power decks or "rule them all" style decks as there are just too many quests that have all attachment immune enemies or only a boss that is player/attachment immune.
AT: Gimli. Not a fan of Gimli but Gandalf should never have been made and is on a different level power wise to all other heroes which is stupid. No one hero should be that good or have that many attachments all to themself (and we haven't even gotten Narya yet.....)
AU: Boromir (T). Look don't get me wrong Erestor is awesome and I love how much he opens up the deck building in this game but at the same time he is definitely not for me... Boromir on the other hand served me well for quite a long time when I first got him. He can be the centerpiece of a deck and just be amazing. He can unfortunately be abused very easily which to me is his biggest downside....
As impressive as it is to see people like Seastan make decks that break the game to me this is always somewhat upsetting. To me personally it makes the game a little less fantastic and that little bit more dodgy and not playtested or designed well enough every time a new one of these decks emerges.
Boromir is usually in most of these decks.... he personally is not to blame though! :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]
AV: Erkenbrand. Love defensive heroes and have never liked Eowyn. Go Erkenbrand and his extremely unique shadow cancellation!
AW: Aragorn (T). Oh.... so won't need to vote against Amarthiul long after all..... theres no way hes going to beat Aragorn (T)..... right?
AX: Arwen Undomiel. I am warming up to this hero more every day and I think I have discovered a pretty nifty strategy/way to play her that might be extremely powerful and fun!
AY: Faramir (Le). Break the Dam! Release the River (of Ents)!

AJ: Galadriel - just so good for a variety of decks (as is Pippin, to be fair), but the consistent card draw with threat reduction is too good
AK: Sam Gamgee - For me, it's the three willpower in Leadership for 8 threat. OK, Glorfindel is uber, but being able to run leadership with a lower threat hero and still quest for at least 3 is epic. Plus, it's Sam.
AL: Beorn - he's a bear
AM: Éomer - in olden times I would not have voted Eomer, but after going through the LOTR saga with him, he's just so good! Hitting for 5 quite easily, yahoo!
AN: Aragorn (Lo) - good rounded stats and one of the best abilities in the game
AO: Legolas - still a go-to hero. Targeted stats and a great ability.
AP: Beregond - Merry is a bit cheesy, but Beregond is a solid and interesting hero
AQ: Haldir of Lorien - argh, so hard! I think I slight prefer Haldir, but maybe I need to play with Mablung more. His ability is awesome!
AR: Elrond - again, hard! But Elrond's overall solid abilities (that lack conditions) makes him better
AS: Damrod - makes trap decks sing. That alone wins it for me!
AT: Gandalf - YOU SHALL NOT PASS!
AU: Boromir (T) - maybe I need to use Erestor more, but for me Boromir is just so cool
AV: Éowyn - still a class act
AW: Aragorn (T) - the abilities are so cool, and the fact that they help out with enemies that Aragorn isn't necessarily attacking is amazing
AX: Celeborn - I really like Celeborn's ability, and I haven't got Arwen yet...
AY: Théoden (S) - this dude is so good for Rohan decks. Makes them hum along nicely, and he's got really good stats.

AJ: As much as I love Pippin, gotta go with Galadriel here

AK: I can't vote against both of my favorite Hobbit heroes!  Spirit G is amazing, but I love Sam Gamgee

AL: Let's go with Frodo here

AM: Love me some Rohan.  Eomer!

AN: The art alone gives this one to Strider.  Aragorn it is

AO: Gotta be Legolas.  Great hero

AP: Tactics Merry or Beregond.  As my Hobbit deck has gone from Tactics Merry to Spirit Merry, I'm going to give this one to Beregond.

AQ: Ooh, two good ones here between Mablung and Haldir.  I like Haldir ally better in my Silvan deck, and Mablung is great in the Ranger deck.  Let's go with Mablung.

AR: Elrond.  No question.

AS: Spirit Merry or Damrod.  Honestly don't remember what Damrod does (is he the trap guy?), but whatever, doesn't matter because Spirit Merry is legit.  Some even say he's the best Hobbit hero by a mile!

AT: Ooh, Gandalf or Gimli?  Gandalf is too tricksy for me to play, but I prefer Gimli ally to Gimli hero.  Tough call here, but Gimli it is.

AU: Tactics Boromir or Erestor.  Another tough one.  Boromir is insane, but Erestor fuels a lot of really fun decks.  I'm excited for the Noldor stuff, but I don't think it's quite there yet (or maybe I just can't get the Erestor/Gloin jank deck going as well as I'd like it too.  Give it to Boromir.

AV: Eowyn or Erkenbrand?  Eowyn.

AW: Scorpagorn versus his (probable) apprentice Amarthiul.  I don't know how to pronounce Amarthiul.  Scorpagorn wins.

AX: Disappointed that no dwarf was in this matchup (AX! Come on!).  Celeborn or Arwen.  Silvans are fun to play, so give me Celeborn.

AY: Another good matchup between leadership Faramir and Santa Theoden.  The rohan deck is alive and well, so Theoden wins here.

AJ: Pippin (Lo) - I love it when cards have two abilities that work brilliantly both separately and in tandem. Also, Pippin just works out of the box; Galadriel needs her toys to shine.
AK: Glorfindel (S) - Forgive me my indulgence.
AL: Frodo Baggins - Beorn is just too limited in his uses at present, although with the advent of Honour Guard, perhaps he may come to have some purpose after all.
AM: Éomer - Coreagorn just doesn't do it for me any more.
AN: Prince Imrahil - With so many archetypes involving characters leaving play (Eagles, Silvan, Rohan), Imrahil is wonderfully flexible.
AO: Legolas - The whole Doomed keyword on player cards mechanic just never really appealed to me.
AP: Beregond - It's too difficult to pass up the peace of mind that the ever-defending Beregond provides.
AQ: Mablung - You don't have to build around him and can just slip him into any aggro deck, or you can build around him to maximize your resource gain.
AR: Rossiel - Although I haven't actually built a victory display shenanigan deck yet, the idea of it makes me giddy.
AS: Merry (S) - With good scrying and encounter deck manipulation, he's a threat reduction machine.
AT: Gandalf - Because Gandalf.
AU: Erestor - For purely aesthetic reasons.
AV: Éowyn - I haven't found Erkenbrand's effect particularly exciting.
AW: Aragorn (T) - Easily my favourite incarnation of Aragorn yet.
AX: Arwen Undomiel - It's difficult to contend with the 'wow' factor of a new hero card, especially when it's one that I at least have been waiting for for some time.
AY: Faramir (Le) - Same reason as Mablung. Also, I can't look past Santa.

As a bear, I am sorely disappointed in the voting trend.

 

We all know that Frodo was nothing without Sam.

 

Beorn, on the other hand, doesn't need a support Gardener to be a hero.

AJ: Galadriel - Static threat, card draw in spirit... I do like lore pippin, but Galadriel is an amazing hero.
AK: Sam Gamgee - 3 willpower for 8 threat makes Sam splashable in almost any deck (especially as a leadership hero). You don't even need his awesome abillity.
AL: Frodo Baggins - Frodo is still an amazing defender, especially with newer ways to keep threat down.
AM: Éomer - I like other iterations of Aragorn better, and Eomer is just fun to play.
AN: Prince Imrahil - Difficult decision, but there are now many cards that work with things leaving play (ie. eagles, rohan, silvan)
AO: Legolas - Doomed seems purely useful for solo play. Never been a fan.
AP: Merry (T) - Beregond is great, but merry is extremely splashable. He is also very fun in a hobbit deck.
AQ: Mablung - Mablung has something nearly unique in tactics: resource generation. Excellent as the sole tactics hero in a multi-sphere deck.
AR: Rossiel - I do love Elrond, but Rossiel is just fun and potentially even more powerful under the right circumstances.
AS: Merry (S) - Amazing abillity that enables a lot of other strategies - really the first time I feel maintaining secrecy for an entire game has been viable.
AT: Gimli - I still feel that having a Gandalf hero is kind of... wrong. Plus I am a huge fan of both Gandalf allies. Also, I like the risk/reward style that Gimli and Gloin employ.
AU: Boromir (T) - Extremely powerful hero given the right tools, also quite fun to play. I don't have Erestor yet, though he looks to be fun as well.
AV: Éowyn - There are other/better ways of defending, and Erkenbrand screams for solely a lore pairing.
AW: Aragorn (T) - Very fun to use, possible the best iteration of Aragorn.
AX: Arwen Undomiel - Resource acceleration in spirit? I do like Celeborn, but find the constant shuffling of silvan decks to be annoying.
AY: Faramir (Le) - Like Mablung, a very flexible hero - especially since we have so many excellent allies now.

AJ: Galadriel v Pippin (Lo) - As much as I like Pippin Lore, I like Galadriel better. Not only gameplay-wise: her art is amazing ( I do not like Magali's style a lot, but for me Galadriel had been her masterpiece until we got Arwen). She's a noldor, a much more fascinating character compared to a hobbit. Finally, Galadriel makes mono spirt decks much more fun to play, so here we go.
AK: Glorfindel (S) v Sam Gamgee - As far as power level is concerned there no doubts, even considering Sam is an exceptionally strong hero. Flavor-wise, Glorfindel is one of my favorite characters. Finally, I love how is card is so thematic in its mechanics: he has the ability to conceal himself from Sauron's gaze, but if he chooses to take an active role in the exploring and adventuring he will inexorably draw the attention of the enemy; just awesome.
AL: Frodo Baggins v Beorn - I like Beorn a lot, both as a character and as a hero. In fact, I was very tempted to vote him instead. However, I cannot help but think he almost never makes into my decks, while Frodo does and granted me some awesome moments -'Oh no, Hummerhorns engage this round! We're gonna lose a Hero! -Engages Hummerhorns, raises threat while mimicking Frodo wearing the Ring to avoid the giant buzzing wasps; follows a collective sigh of relief. :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]
AM: Éomer v Aragorn (Le) - I let my sentimentalism take over on this one, and I'll go with the nostalgia of my first games, playing with Eomer the Voice of Isengard quests. He's an interesting hero too.
AN: Aragorn (Lo) v Prince Imrahil - I've never liked Imrahil too much. Loragorn is amazing.
AO: Legolas v Gríma - Controversial I know. Legolas is awesome. If I were to vote considering the flavor it would be th Son of Thranduil victorious without breaking a sweat. However, gameplay-wise my preference goes to Grima Sweettongue. First, Grima appeals to the solo player in me: he's one of the cases of a card designed to work better in solitaire than in multiplayer, while still being viable in multiplayer - if your friends aren't too particular about their threat level of course :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] Furthermore, Legolas tends to dominate the deckbuilding of every deck he's in: 3x HutB, 3x Bows,3x Blades, 3x Foe-Hammer etc. While effective, it is also boring after a while. Grima however enable a host of crazy decks to function and is very very powerful: he's by no means inferior to Legolas power-wise.
AP: Beregond v Merry (T). As I've already stated (see previous round of voting) I don't like how easily Merry can be abused and I don't like the notion of a Hobbit attacking better than, say, Halbarad.

AQ: Haldir of Lorien v Mablung. See previous round, I love Haldir and he's very strong too. It's a pity, because I also like Mablung and play him quite often.
AR: Elrond v Rossiel. Not a fan of Rossiel: flavor-wise, her reference to elf-magic is great, but her personal story is lame. Elrond is great, I only wish Vilya was less of a cheeky play, but it's still fun to use.
AS: Merry (S) v Damrod. I love this side of Merry, the judicious one. The hero is also very very powerful. It's a pity he is matched against his best fellow (I have very good deck that runs both). I rate Damrod lower because, albeit good, he is forced into a limited archetype, whereas Merry is much more flexible.
AT: Gandalf v Gimli. Gandalf is Gandalf.
AU: Boromir (T) v Erestor. Despite being prone to abuse, I still like Boromir a lot. He's also one of my favorite characters in the book.
AV: Éowyn v Erkenbrand. Gone are the days in which Eowyn was the only access to high starting WP, even if she still is one of the best options. However she is also tremendously dull. Erkenbrand on the other side is the best defender we currently have, and a great character as well. And the art on him is sooooo much better than that on Eo.
AW: Amarthiul v Aragorn (T). Time will tell, but to beat his chieftain Amarthiul will have to prove his mettle more than once.
AX: Celeborn v Arwen Undomiel. Celeborn, the fashion-victim elf (sorry Magali, couldn't resist making the joke) is good, and silvans are one of my favorite traits too (and nostalgia, again). However he fits only in that kind of deck, whereas Arwen has an amazing artwork (congrats Magali, a huge improvement!) and his amazingly good. Perhaps too good. Who knows? Anyway, she got me so excited thinking about how many new decks could be built with her.. One of my new favorite heroes, for sure.
AY: Théoden (S) v Faramir (Le). I don't like Theoden (and Rohan decks in general) very much, while it looks liek Faramir could be an interesting choice for solo play - I admittedly need to test him a bit more, but he's intriguing.

A slight delay in posting the round 3 results: several matches were so close I had to recount the votes just to be sure

It turns out that out that our AQ match is a tie between Haldir of Lorien and Mablung.

BB: Aragorn (Lo) - Tough call, but I'd say Loreagorn's ability is the more powerful of the two.
BC: Beregond - Would beat Haldir in a fight.
BD: Merry (S) - Threat shenanigans are more fulfilling than Vilya shenanigans.
BE: Gandalf - Still voting for aesthetic reasons on this one.

BF: Aragorn (T) - I kind of want to see an Aragorn face-off, although it's not likely. But this remains my favourite version of Aragorn.
BG: Arwen Undomiel - New and shiny beats old and Santa.

---------------------------------------------

AZ: Sam Gamgee for sure! Great low threat cost leadership hero with great willpower and inbuilt readying. Plus Galadriel won last year against Elrond so she got to go!

BA: Éomer. Frodo beat Beorn?? Boo! Eomer has amazing art and is a fantastic attacker. Not a fan of Frodo, I like to defend with epic defenders not with my threat!

BB: Legolas. Yes he has won this all before but with good reason. Also I think the whole desperate alliance + aragorn conbo to reset everyone s/multiple players threat is lame.

BC: Haldir all the way. I actually prefer him to Legolas and Legolas is epic. Legolas won this whole thing because he is such a fantastic attacker and his great ability. Haldir also has ranged, a 9 threat cost and like Legolas sort of providing an effect similar to asfaloth or other location control, Haldir can provides a feint type effect killing enemies before they can even attack multiple times in a game if he is used right.

Given all this I think he actually deserves a shot at the title. Can't believe he almost lost to Mablung, thank goodness for whoever broke that tie!!!

BD: Elrond. No brainer, Elrond should have beaten Galadriel last year and I'd love for him to also make it to the final.

BE: Boromir (T). Gandalf hero haters UNITE! Lets get him out of this glorious competition!

BF: Aragorn (T). Eowyn sucks, never been a fan. Lets all just discard cards every turn for willpower hurr durr. How about no, how about we boost it in other ways and keep our cards! Hopefully Arwen will replace her in most decks now as they are somewhat similar and are the same sphere and threat cost. Scorpigorn on the other hand is really neat and that -1 def to enemies is really cool, inventive and unique for a hero ability.

BG: Arwen Undomiel. Oh the new hero that I quickly misjudged yet ended up adding her to my decks and is AMAZING in them. Not to mention her awesone art, ability and how long we've wanted an Arwen hero.

AZ: Galadriel v Sam Gamgee - Tough one, but I've been having more fun with Sam in my Dunedain deck lately than I have with Galadriel in my Noldor deck.
BA: Frodo Baggins v Éomer - I built an Eomer deck once. It was really fun. Since then, I've used Frodo again and again, so I guess I'll go with the trusty standby over the one-hit wonder.
BB: Aragorn (Lo) v Legolas - It always surprises me how much I still love many of the core set heroes.
BC: Beregond v Haldir of Lorien - Another tough call... I have had a lot of fun with both of these heroes, but in the end I'll go with the tricksier of the two because that's what appeals to me.
BD: Elrond v Merry (S) - I didn't use Elrond much until recently, and mostly that's been to try to get use out of Corefindel. I've had better success with Spirit Merry enabling some multiplayer secrecy shenanigans, however, and secrecy is just so darn fun.
BE: Gandalf v Boromir (T) - I am still not sure I have ever built a Tactics Boromir deck. Gandalf isn't my favourite either, but I do consider him from time to time when I build decks.
BF: Éowyn v Aragorn (T) - I really like Rohan. I still have the dream of playing through the Saga again and using Eowyn + Herugrim as my main attacker.
BG: Arwen Undomiel v Théoden (S) - I really like the new Arwen hero, but Spirit Theoden brought Rohan decks on the map in a big way. It wouldn't feel right to vote against him for a hero I still haven't tried yet.

AZ: Galadriel (As much as I appriciate Sam knocking out Glorfindel, Galadriel is just to good. Sorry Sam :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png] )
BA: Éomer (Frodo is good in sooking up big attacks, but you know you could also chumpblock and whipe out your enemys with Eomer! Easy choice here)
BB: Legolas (Who cares about threat if you can shoot your way to victory with Legolas!)
BC: Beregond (You need Defense? Get Beregond! You need a silvan hero to kill enemys and get your tactic weapons going? Get Legolas, not Haldir!)
BD: Elrond (I still don't get it why people love this hero so much. Galadriel does so much more then Merry!)
BE: Boromir (T) (See, we all know that Gandalf hero is OP especially with all his toys. BUT we also know that they should never have made a hero version of Gandalf. So please, get over him)

And suddenly my decisions are easy again, because so many of (in my opinion) the 'wrong' heroes won in the last round...

 

AZ: Galadriel - She just lets you do so much.
BA: Frodo Baggins - Should've been Beorn, but as it is I'll take the guy who can defend literally anything.
BB: Aragorn (Lo) - Threat reset is so good. If Grima made it through this would've been a much more difficult decision.
BC: Beregond - Should've been Mablung, but I guess I'll take the ever-reliable wall that is Beregond.
BD: Elrond - Still amazing, as much as I've been loving Spirit Merry in some decks.
BE: Gandalf - Should've been Erestor, but with him gone, I'll take the tricksy Gandalf plays over the ease of endless readying.
BF: Aragorn (T) - A game a couple of days ago reminded me why I do like Tactagorn, while Eowyn can still feel overused.
BG: Arwen Undomiel - Can't believe Theoden beat Faramir, but it leaves me another easy choice. Flexibility > Trait-specific, and I've never been hugely into Rohan anyway.

AZ: Galadriel v Sam Gamgee - Sam is just more fun to play in my opinion. Readying, stat boosting, questing, defending... He is trying to help everywhere.
BA: Frodo Baggins v Éomer - No Rohan fan. But a Frodo Loragorn deck was one of the first I really fell in love with, so Frodo it is of course.
BB: Aragorn (Lo) v Legolas - While Legolas is a really good fighter, I don't use him that often anymore and Loragorn makes it quite often into my decks.
BC: Beregond v Haldir of Lorien - Beregond is a wall. He decides who can get in and out. Haldir can't.
BD: Elrond v Merry (S) - This is 1 of the only 2 close matchups for me this round, but since I own Gandalf Elrond has become one of my favorite heros. Spirit Merry is good too, but not good enough to beat a member of the White Council.
BE: Gandalf v Boromir (T) - As much as I like Boromir, Gandalf's tricks are to much fun to not vote for him
BF: Éowyn v Aragorn (T) - The other, even closer, hard matchup. Éowyn does work since the core set, but Aragorn's engage marathon is quite entertaining. In the end Éowyn has to many alternatives to make the cut and Aragorn vs Arwen would be a funny duell next round :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] 
BG: Arwen Undomiel v Théoden (S) - I don't really like Rohan Decks in general (execpt a Dunhere attack staging area deck) or any of the 2 Théodens. And Arwen seems like a pretty good hero.

Glad to see the Hero Championship up and running this year. Alas, for the second year in a row I haven't discovered it until the later rounds. As Eomer once said: "Need brooks no delay, but late is better than never!" On to my picks:

AZ: Galadriel - sorry Sam fans, but Galadriel can just do more overall than Mr. Gamgee, especially when she has Nenya and her mirror.

BA: Eomer - gotta vote for the guy you quote. In all seriousness, though, I use Eomer more than Frodo, and his ability is less perilous than Frodo's.

BB: Aragorn (Lo) - his threat reduction is just so good that I can't pass it up. Plus, he benefits from all things Dunedain, like Wingfoot.

BC: Beregond - good ol` Beregond always comes through. With all his toys, he simply becomes unstoppable . . . until the Mûmak barges in.

BD: Elrond - my vote from last year holds true. Elrond is most definitely more versatile in the many things that he can do, whilst Sperry is pretty much only good for questing.

BE: Gandalf - Istari. Enough said.

BF: Aragorn (T) - if this thing ends with Aragorn (Lo) versus Aragorn (T), I'm going to laugh.

BG: Théoden - I've yet to see Arwen.

Every time someone plays them, the entire game is focused around "how can we protect your hobbits from dying" while also providing very little in the way of doing anything.  Frodo is really the only one I find acceptable.  Sam is okay stats wise, but I don't really like him.

AZ: Galadriel -  I hate Galadriel, but I hate hobbits more.

AZ: Sam Gamgee: Tough call.  I'll take Sam because he becomes a super hero in every campaign I play.
BA: Éomer: I guess I should use Frodo more often, given all the love he's getting in this contest, but I play campaign mode often enough that I don't put him in my decks.  Eomer is a thematic and game play win, so I'll vote for him.
BB: Aragorn (Lo): My reasoning, as it has been every round, is that Legolas has an ally version that's better (though Aragorn has another hero version that is arguably better).  Loragorn makes lots of fun shenanigans possible.
BC: Beregond: another tough call.  Haldir is excellent, but I'll take the super defender.
BD: Merry (S): He really makes hobbit secrecy possible.  The black riders hobbit deck is excellent, but Merry's repeatable threat lowering really allows you to play like hobbits should feel.
BE: Gandalf: Tough call, and both are overpowered.  I like Gandalf shenanigans over Boromir shenanigans.
BF: Aragorn (T): Really powerful, really fun.

AZ: Sam Gamgee. You can build around his ability as a key element of your deck, or he can be 3 WP for low threat. Galadriel is a glorified attachment.

BA: Frodo Baggins. Never disappointing.

BB: Aragorn (Lo). Legolas is nice, but Aragorn's ability is so powerful.

BC: Beregond. I like characters with a 4 attribute.

BD: Elrond. Haven't played with Spirit Merry enough, doubt he'll match Elrond.

This isn't going to be anywhere near as tough as the last one..

 

 

AZ: Galadriel v Sam Gamgee: Galadriel is fun, a lot of fun. Both very good heroes though, the closest matchup this round for me.
BA: Frodo Baggins v Éomer: I like Eomer, but he never really worked for me. No ranged and having access only to Firefoot as +2 ATK cripples him. If we see something for him in the future he might make a big comeback though.
BB: Aragorn (Lo) v Legolas: Loragorn threat shenanigans sometimes feel broken to me, but he's more entertaining to play and cannot be substituted for in decks, while the same is not true for Legolas.
BC: Beregond v Haldir of Lorien: I could maybe fathom voting Mablung last time, but this time is not close at all. If you're playing a scenario with no punishing shadows, sure Beregond is nice. But if you do - most now have awful shadow effects - Beregond is not gonna help you much. Enemy attacks again. Enemy gains +X attack. Discard defending character (Hello Sudden Pitfall!). Deal damage to defending character. Hmm. Haldir on the other hand is the paradigm of safety: not only he kills the enemy, he prevents it from attacking! So no shadows, no need to declare a defender etc. etc. Haldir also solves a lot of situations in which you have a tough enemy you cannot take out of the staging area without some serious pain! Of course Haldir has his limitations (otherwise he would be too powerful), the biggest one perhpas being the need for at least a weapon (Bow/Blade), kinda forcing you to play Tactics. But he when he is geared up (and that's far from difficult to achieve), he owns. Plus the amazing flavor of course. Vote Haldir! Vote the Protector of Lorien!
BE: Gandalf v Boromir (T). I feel like Gandalf doesn't break a whole game mechanic; rather, he bends the rules a little bit..
BF: Éowyn v Aragorn (T). Aragorn (T) is a beast, Eowyn is boring. Both are kind of boring TBH, as Tactagorn very often makes games boring (he almost never get played in my group, especially not with Merry (T), just because he's too good). However of the two I enjoy more curshing a horde of enemies, rather than questing for 4 each and every round.
BG: Arwen Undomiel v Théoden (S). She is awesome. She is awesomeness made real.

AZ: Galadriel v Sam Gamgee: Galadriel is only looking better with her granddaughter in play. A free card which can also turn into a resource? Sam's great, but I make more decks with her.

BA: Frodo Baggins v Éomer: A great ability in a pinch. Useful for when you suddenly have to take an undefended attack due to shadow cards.

BB: Aragorn (Lo) v Legolas: Such a boon for Tactics. Location control which would otherwise destroy a Tactics deck, making them semi-soloable.

BC: Beregond v Haldir of Lorien: I love both, but the ability to remove threats not engaged with you wins out over having to defend and have an attacker.

BD: Elrond v Merry (S): Not a huge fan of the Elrond type deck. Secrecy Hobbits though...

BE: Gandalf v Boromir (T): Boromir is OP. Especially with all the threat reduction there is now. Gandalf is fun, but the ally version is such a staple. 

BF: Éowyn v Aragorn (T): Tough call, but Aragorn's ability is slightly more useful. It really shines in a multiplayer game, if you're all attack.

BG: Arwen Undomiel v Théoden (S): Poor Théoden. Beaten by someone not even available. But Arwen looks great. Can't wait for a Galadriel, Caldara, Arwen deck. Then swordthain ally Glorfindel.

AZ: Sam Gamgee - This is an excellent match up, between two of the best heroes (and two I use quite often). Have to give the nod to Sam, though.
BA: Frodo Baggins - I love using Frodo as a defender, and he forms an integral part of my Sam/Galadriel/Frodo deck... so at least two parts can continue on.
BB: Aragorn (Lo) - Legolas is excelleng, but replaceable - Lore Aragorn is always amazing.
BC: Haldir - This should have been Mablung. But Haldir is at least quite fun to play.
BD: Elrond - Even without his ring, Elrond is an excellent and powerful hero, enabling many decks.
BE: Boromir (T) - Why is there a Gandalf hero? Anyway, Boromir is incredibally fun to play.

BF: Aragorn (T) - Eowyn is still good, but one dimensional (though using her as an attacker is now quite enticing).

I feel that Sam has had potentially the most difficult path thus far - Spirit Glorfindel and then Galadriel? All the more impressive if he can vanquish both Noldor.

 

Then again, there is a reason he was the longest serving mayor in shire history.

BD: Elrond v Merry (S) : I like a lot the new options Merry brings to the table, he might even be a bit too strong!

Too many tough choices in earlier rounds, but now it's easier enough for me to stop lurking

 

AZ: Sam Gamgee - hero-gardener extraordinaire! (meaning no offense, your Ladyship)

BA: Éomer - solid, and I can't use Frodo in my saga campaign

BB: Aragorn (Lo) - perhaps my favourite hero art, and ally Legolas is probably better than hero Legolas

BC: Beregond - beautifully captures the valour of Gondor, by which "the terror of Morgul [is] kept at bay"

BD: Merry (S) - tough call, but I love hobbit decks that are more sneaky than combat-heavy

BE: Gandalf - in campaign, sacrificing Gandalf to kill the Balrog > sacrifing Boromir to do 1 damage to Uruk-Hai with toughness

BF: Aragorn (T) - fun, but toughest pick this round, since Herugrim (unthematically) makes Éowyn more interesting

BG: Théoden (S) - essential for Rohan decks, which are developing nicely

 

"I have something to do before the end, and it lies ahead... I must see it through, sir, if you understand me."

Go Sam!

BA: Éomer: Just so much more fun than blocking with Frodo (plus it's a Magali)
BB: Legolas: This one was really tough, but lately I've been using Legolas a lot more in my decks.
BC: Beregond: I've always been fond of this guy. Many have argued that both require attachments to be really good. Beregond's come at a discounted price.
BD: Elrond: Cool ring vs cool jacket... and while I agree with Brandon (that coat is cool), Elrond just has so much more swagger
BE: Boromir (T): This is a vote for CotR
BF: Éowyn: I'd really like to see an Uncle v Niece match-up in the next round
BG: Théoden (S): Both are Spirit cost reducers. Arwen's art is amazing. But, in the end Theoden has saved me what, 100+ resources? Arwen has currently gained me zero resources.

AZ: Sam Gamgee - probably the best hobbit released so far, and he finds his way into lots of my decks

BA: Frodo Baggins - takes away all the stress of defending (also I love hobbits)

BB: Aragorn (Lo) - I never really understood the love for Legolas, also his ally version is such a game changer for tactics

BC: Beregond - one of the best defenders in the game, not much to say

BD: Elrond - this was a tough one, but spirit Merry keeps me from playing his tactics version, so Elrond gets the edge

BE: Gandalf - Boromir shall not pass! 

BF: Aragorn (T) - another tough one, but Aragorn has more decisions, and is the more fun hero to play

BG: Theoden (S) - No way should an unreleased hero defeat Theoden, who singlehandedly breathed life into the Rohan trait- even if he does look like Santa

What a round it was.
- We saw Galadriel, our #1 seed, defeated by Sam.
- Our #3 (Éowyn) and #4 (Aragorn (Lo) ) seeds were also knocked out in brutal upsets. 
- Arwen’s amazing run as now just released hero came to an end.
- Only Beregond an Elrond remain from our top 5!

--- Round 5 ---

 

8 heroes are reducing down to 4

 

We have a cruel duel of hobbit kinship, a battle of tactics sphere staples, two eleven ring holders, and a class of kings

BH: Frodo Baggins - Would much rather have a strong defender with Frodo than Sam.

BI: Legolas - Beregond is good, but I've grown to dislike him due to shadow cards that obliterate him.  Getting A Burning Brand on Beregond is just too much trouble.  I'd rather just make my dedicated hero defender be Lore.  Legolas, in my opinion, is just the best ranged hero in Tactics.

BJ: Elrond - Gandalf just hinders too many people in multi-player from using the ally version which offers so much.

BK: Theoden (S) - Theoden makes the Rohan deck finally work.  Aragorn can be great at cleaning up enemies, but I can do that with just about any deck.

BH: Sam Gamgee v Frodo Baggins: Sam enables the Hobbit style deck more than Frodo. Frodo is a great "Just in case" defense, but I prefer to have a dedicated defender like Beregond or Erkenbrand. Sorry, Mr. Frodo.

BI: Legolas v Beregond: Hard choice, but with all the support ranged has, plus Arod, Legolas is my choice. Being able to snipe an enemy with Hands Upon the Bow, makes it so you don't have to defend.

BJ: Elrond v Gandalf: As much as I'd hate to be Gandalf guy, he is amazing. The odd thing is, Elrond is typically his best partner with Vilya. Still, once he has all his toys, he's amazing.

BK: Aragorn (T) v Théoden (S): Clash of the kings! Tactics Aragorn is just so good. Multiplayer, he can grab enemies off the players dedicated to questing or support. The -1 Defense is often guaranteeing some type of damage goes on to an enemy. He helps the Dunedain archetype. Theodan's cost reduction is great, and helps Rohan, but for some reason, I still feel like Rohan is missing one or two key cards to make them great.

BH: Sam Gamgee - Gardener, ring-bearer, mayor, chef. So many additional traits that could be explored with Master Samwise!

BI: Legolas - As perfect a defensive wall as Beregond is, attacking is more fun than defending, every time. 

BJ: Gandalf - Really tough match-up, each a member of the White Council and each bearing one of the Three. But Gandalf is the only Istari hero.

BK: Aragorn (T) - Dunedain aggro is just more fun than Rohan mustering.

BH: Sam Gamgee - With Pippin out, Sam is my new champion (and he even avenged Pippin by taking down Galadriel).  Plus, we all know who was the real rock on Frodo and Sam's trip to Mount Doom.

BI: Beregond - Very tough call here.  Going with Beregond because he has less competition and Legolas has already won the championship.

BJ: Elrond - My two least favorite of the remaining 8 matched up against each other.  As someone that rarely plays solo, Gandalf hero is virtually unplayable (or at least you don't want to be "Gandalf Guy").

BK: Aragorn (T) - Another very tough call.  I've had a lot of fun with both heroes.  I'd vote for Theoden here if he had 3 willpower or the art from his tactics version.

BJ: Gandalf - the only difficult decision this round, and whoever wins this one will be my pick for the final victory. I'll give the nod to the wizard this time, there are just so many options with Gandalf, and that'll only get expanded on with the presumption that Narya is coming.

I can appreciate where you're coming from. There are certainly match-ups (this round and prior) where I cannot understand why people vote a certain way. However, after 20 votes, all are the match-ups are extremely close... except for Sam who has 85% of the votes against Frodo.

The decisions get more difficult.....

BH: Sam Gamgee: Except for this one.  I have no idea how Frodo made it this far, but good on him.  He doesn't hold a candle to Sam, though.
BI: Beregond: I'll take the defensive wall over the master archer.  This decision was difficult, but I prefer Legolas' ally version to the hero, and Gondor to Elves.
BJ: Gandalf: Really tough call.  Elrond is great, but Gandalf is just a bit better. 
BK: Aragorn (T):  And the hardest decision.  I'll take Tactics Aragorn because I want to see at least one version of Aragorn continue to advance.

While there are other heroes I would prefer to see in the final 8, I think all of these heroes are good and at least worthy of being discussed as one of the best in the game.

goddamnit why is gandalf still in this.... looks like hes gonna beat Elrond too.... lame.... if he wins the whole thing......

I'd rather Legolas win again to be honest :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

 

BH: Sam by a massive longshot.

BI: Legolas. I honestly don't think Beregond is that great a defender, yeah he has all he right stats and sentinel and attachments are more or less free on him. I find that the main most detrimental things that you need to worry about when it comes to defending enemy attacks is extra attacks you weren't expecting or horrible shadow effects. Elrohir and Erkenbrand both combat these issues and so do other heroes. Beregond can't do jack against either of these threats unless you load him up with readying attachments and run x3 Behind Strong Walls or run lots of shadow cancellation (all of which take up deck slots and require you to actually draw them). Elrohir and Erkenbrand have these effects built in and are in my opinion far far better defenders. Legolas is definitely one of the best attackers hands down, yes his 3 attack and ranged is more or less the offensive version of Beregond's 4 defence and sentinel and yes his ability is to do with progress and not necessarily offense but attacking enemies is so much more straightforward than defending against them. There are no player shadow cards for example and we can attack with multiple characters against one enemy (can only ever block with one character at a time unless you run that one crappy event...) so you don't need to be quite as specialised or amazing to be a great attacker, you just need brute force and ranged. His progress ability is just insanely good as well and makes him, in a way, a great quester/progress placing hero as well. Beregond blocks and that's it folks!

Also 0 willpower just sucks, I think every hero needs to have at least 1... yes I know you will almost never quest with him but Erkenbrand can quest with snowmane or steed of the mark if you really want or are desperate and Elrohir can quest on certain turns that you play Naith Guide or Lembas for example and has 2 willpower! Also Beregond just cannot handle the cold, dies instantly if you ask him to accompany you through the redhorn gate, literally just straight up dies when you get near the top of the mountain! :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

BJ: Elrond. I strongly recommend EVERYONE who hasn't voted vote for Elrond. Gandalf is better yes but he is better than any hero. Does everything, has more unique attachments than ANYONE and will probably receive his ring of power as well and I'm sure it like all his other attachments will be super powerful yet mega cheap to play.

He does everything, he can receive pretty much any attachment if its on top of your deck, draw a retarded amount of cards, discard shadow cards, gain resources, draw cards, abuse the HELL out of cards like treasure hunter and really just cheeses up the game in general. Want to beat a quest with next to no chance of losing whatsoever? Build a broken Gandalf deck! Want to play easy mode without actually playing easy mode? Use Gandalf!

I know lots of people are gonna hate this rant and will disagree wholeheartedly but I know that many of you also agree and hate the abomination that is the gandalf hero!!

Don't vote for Gandalf he has already won this whole tournament, he is clearly better than any other hero and was more or less designed to be exactly that. The best hero but with the highest threat cost. get. him. OUTTA HERE! :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] 

BK: Aragorn (T). I have to say I am a little surprised it is the tactics aragorn that is the only aragorn that remains. I also have to say he gets my vote even if I barely used him when he came out. I will one day.... not sure if I can say the same of Theoden.... just not a Rohan kinda guy...

I am extraordinarily pleased with the tournament this year. I think it has been very accurate because of a large number of voters with thoughtfulness and experiance. The flashy new toys are not overvalued and the vocal propaganda being thrown around is often falling on deaf ears. I don't know who will win, but it will be well deserved.

BH: Sam Gamgee. It is clear that Frodo cannot win the whole thing. If he has to go down, at least he can go down to his best friend and faithful companion, Sam.

BI: Beregond. People are truly beginning to understand how much of a powerhouse Beregond is. With all due respect to other great defenders like Erkenbrand and Elrohir, Beregond is the best of the best. Soon he will be added to the list of heroes that the hipster players refuse to use because he trivialize the quests and makes the game boring. I can think of no greater honor.

BJ: Gandalf. Other than the embarrassment that is Spirit Glorfindel, no other hero enraged the haters like Gandalf. The thing is, when Seastan builds his many broken decks that demand immediate errata I never seem to see Gandalf in the lineup. Interesting... Anyway, the more I play Gandalf the more I tip my hat to the designers for creating a masterpiece. The guy is supposed to be iconic and powerful and game changing and FUN. They were going to get hate no matter what, and they took on the challenge and made a card that honors the character. The biggest reason to vote for Gandalf is not because he is powerful, but because he is unique, creative, fun, and flavorful. Stick your finger in the eye of the haters and vote for the best hero in the game, Gandalf.

BK: Théoden (S). I am shocked and pleased to see Theoden make it this far. He is the only hero left that grants a global buff to a particular tribe. Dain, Celeborn, Outlands guy--there all gone, but not Santa. Rohan is still my favorite tribe and I am glad to see that I am not alone in my love.

I am throwing my support fully behind Gandalf now. I think he deserves to be the first repeat champion.

BH: Sam Gamgee - dunno, just use him more. I think his utility is interesting.

BI: Legolas - man, just always a good vote for me. The first winner I think, and the only core hero left (a testament, whatever happens, to how good he is)

BJ: Gandalf - argh! I kinda wanna vote for both, but I'll go for Gandalf because in my recent memory he has been the hero who has made me think about silly decks and such. Always good to have

BK: Theoden - I'm happy to see that his utility is being appreciated by his deep run in the tournament. He's the glue of Rohan, and also makes the other colours of Rohan play more easily. I think he's superbly designed.

My opinions differed so strongly from the majority's on the last round of votes that I am left with really obvious choices between a very good hero and an a good one or difficult choices between two heroes who, for me, are not top notch.

 

BH: Sam Gamgee v Frodo Baggins. Sam has 3 WP in leadership for 8 threat (the lowest possible in that sphere), and Bill the Pony. Frodo has ally Sam coming though... Funny how Sam risked being his own nemesis here.
BI: Legolas v Beregond. No brainer. I wholeheartedly agree with Psychorocka here.
BJ: Elrond v Gandalf. I find Gandalf more fun to play than Elrond, aside from being stronger of course. I can understand voting the other way though, as Elrond can grant some awesome (if random) moments with Vilya plus Stargazer and makes healing a trivial matter.
BK: Aragorn (T) v Théoden (S). Complete no brainer. From now on, I'm rooting for Tactagorn.

BH: Sam Gamgee v Frodo Baggins

 

I'm voting Frodo, but I am 100% sure Sam will win.

While Sam is great, he really falls off, if/when your threat gets to high. That shoudn't happen too often if you build the deck right/play right, but it limits the heroes you can use, if you want to make safe use of Sam's ability. On the other hand if you run Frodo you usually have a lot of threat reducing effects (something I don't think is necessary in a Sam/Hobbit Deck) and don't care so much about a potential raise. Just commit Frodo to the quest (like Sam), if you get attacked simply raise your threat. There are attacks Frodo can defend, but Sam would just get slaughtered by., too. All in all for me it's Frodo > Sam in most decks (exceptions I can think of right know: Saga, Mono Leadership).

 

BI: Legolas v Beregond

 

Close call, but I prefer a good defense over spectacular offense. Beregond is really good in siege quests, too (high defense is not so common like attack).


BJ: Elrond v Gandalf

 

Even closer! Elrond and Gandalf are probably the two most powerfull heroes currently in the game. Both with strong stats, effects and personal toys, even Aragorn can't come close to. And both have an ally Version, which are both very good (Gandalf also has the OhauH incarnation :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]). It took me a while but in the end I will go with Elrond. Having 3 Armor and being a lore hero makes Elrond a great Defender, I would even say better than Beregond, as it's super easy to ignore any possible shadow Cards and get healing on the table, which is then even boosted! That Elronds helps you pay for all your allies is just the icing on the cake.

Gandalf adds 1 to your handsize, what is cool, but would only mean you drew 2 cards turn one and then play normally, IF Gandalf wouldn't be allowed to pay for your extra Card no matter what sphere AND (now we come to the main reason why Elrond > Gandalf) you couldn't do These I know the Card shenanigans: draw the Card with expert treasure hunter or Play the Card for free with Vilya. And that's it. In my opinion Elrond is the greater buff for Gandalf than vice versa. Of Course Gadlaf is cool and everything, but if I can't have both, I would take Elrond

 

BK: Aragorn (T) v Théoden (S)

 

Easy decision. As always Rohan won't get my vote. And Tactagorn is a really good hero.

 

 

Some predictions: Next round will be Sam v Legolas and Elrond v Theoden, what will lead to a Sam v Elrond final, that the elf-lord will win. It's really cool, that we have two Oldies (Legolas, core set. and Elrond, shadow and flame) against to comparable fresh heroes (even though Sam is much older than Théoden (S) release-wise), what shows, that the community likes their old toys as much as their new ones.

BH: Sam Gamgee - I like Frodo a lot as well, but Sam seems to find himself in more of my decks.

BI: Legolas - Legolas is a lot more fun to use than Beregond. Despite being from the core set, he is still one of the game's premeiere attackers.

BJ: Elrond - Why is there a Gandalf hero? I'm still not sure. What I am sure of is that Elrond is awesome (even without Vilya) and deserves to win.

BK: Aragorn (T) - Yeah, Theoden makes the Rohan deck work well.... but Tactics Aragorn is just so fun to play!

 

I'm really hoping that Elrond can overcome Gandalf here; I enjoy decks with the master of Rivendel quite a bit more. If not, Sam Gamgee for the win!

Yeah, we actually have one hero from three of the four saga boxes. And, at least one hero from every deluxe/cycle combination except VoI/Ring Maker. That's a pretty awesome distribution!

> I want to see Sam win the whole thing.  He came so close against Legolas in 2013, and he hadn't received wide release yet!

 

I think it is pretty certain he will.  The only hero I can see beating him would be Tactics Aragorn and that's just because he is new and shiny and there is no guarantee that Aragorn is going to beat Theoden this round.  Our next round is going to be:

 

Sam v. Beregond

Gandalf v. Aragorn/Theoden

 

Edit: Although, I just looked at past brackets and people tend to value Beregond way higher than I do so maybe he could do it too.

I really enjoy the hero championship but I feel like people are just voting for personal favorites or with a bias to remove a really power hero (spirit Glorfindel). I choose to vote for the heros I feel would give me the best chance of winning against a difficult scenario unseen and try to leave personal bias out. Personally, I really love Frodo Baggins but no way does he deserve to be in this late.

 

Edit:Suggestion for the next hero championship-Group the heros by sphere so we are voting for who the best heros are to represent each sphere of influence (keeping Gandalf out because we all know he deserves to be in the top 5) and let the top hero from each sphere duke it out against each other.

If that had been outlined as the official criteria for this championship, that would be a fair complaint.  But here's the official criteria:

 

Vote for your favorite hero as they enter their match-ups in the responses below. Vote on whatever criteria you desire - this is very informal. 

 

I'm voting for Santa Theoden all the way, because it's Christmas.  And by the ground rules given, that's an equally valid criteria as yours.

Well, that's what is kind of interesting.  People have different views on what constitutes strong, but if we only voted based on strength (which this tournament isn't), imo we could just not hold this tournament and crown Dain the winner every year.  He is basically a 25 willpower, 25 attack, 3 defense, 6 health hero.  And that's just in single player ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

 

So I think it is fine to have people vote on whatever criteria they want.  However, Frodo is easily one of the best defenders in the game.  Although, his match ups throughout this tournament have been relatively easy.

Actually, I don't have any special fondness for Frodo, I've been voting for him primarily based on how powerful he is. Given Seastan used him to solo Carn Dum, I think he definitely fits the criteria of 'best chance of winning against a difficult scenario'. On favouritism I'd be voting for Sam, but for chance of winning I'd back Frodo against most of the other heroes in the game.

In the end though, those are not the criteria anyway. Obviously I can't speak for everyone, but I assume at least a lot of us vote like me based on a mixture of how we perceive the power level of the hero, how much fun we have playing with them, how much we like the character, how much we like the design, and so on. So I voted against Glorfindel because I find him boring, I voted against most Dwarf heroes because most of them only work in Dwarf decks and I like to play a bigger variety of stuff, I voted for Beorn because while he's not the most powerful hero he is incredibly fun to play around with, I'm voting now for Frodo because he's incredibly powerful and for Gandalf because he's incredibly powerful and fun and versatile. Sometimes favouritism will outweigh objective assessment of power level, but not always. And for that matter, we all have vastly different play experiences, so it's questionable as to whether we actually can give completely objective assessments. As already brought up, you try to vote entirely based on who you think would give you the best chances of winning and think Frodo shouldn't have made it this far, but I would back Frodo against most other heroes in the game on those criteria. Clearly we have wildly divergent experiences of playing with Frodo.

 

I've made a couple of posts complaining about 'the wrong heroes winning', but in the end we all have different views on things, and that makes it interesting. I don't harbour any genuine negative feelings towards the many people who repeatedly vote the wrong way, so long as we all remain nice about it and don't go too far in deriding each others' favourite heroes.

My votes aren't careful.  I see a matchup and pick the one I "like" the best.  It's a big synthesis of art, theme, how the ability works, how much fun I've had using that hero...

 

I think power is one of the least important criteria for me.  I enjoy flexible heroes who tend not to be the most powerful, and underplayed heroes who present unique deckbuilding challenges.

Well, at least half of those I voted for advanced. The rest were just completely and utterly obliterated, it seems. On to this round:

BH: Sam Gamgee - Sam is just a great option for most any deck whilst Frodo requires a little more tinkering in order to fit.

BI: Beregond - with so many attacking options out there, Legolas is becoming more generic, although his progress-placing ability can be quite useful at times. On the other hand, who can turn down a powerful defender like Beregond?

BJ: Gandalf - Istari. Enough said. (plus, Shadowfax, Wizard Pipe, Flame of Anor, Gandalf's Staff, etc.)

BK: Théoden (S) - this was probably the hardest choice to make, mostly because I would rate these two as about even. Nevertheless, Théoden's ability allows for a greater usage of the Rohan archetype.

 

Good luck to all the competitors! May the best Man, Elf, Hobbit, or Istari win! (sorry Dwarves; you didn't make the cut this time. Maybe next year)

Sam Gamgee
Beregond
Gandalf
Théoden (S)

What a round it was.
- Sam basically cast Frodo into Mt. Doom with 80% of the votes
- Our stalwart defender trumps our Archer in a pretty close match
- Gandalf won by a single vote!
- Théoden defeats Aragorn in another close match

--- Round 6 ---

 

4 heroes are reducing down to 2 (plus a third place match)

 

We have three spheres plus neutral represented.

Each hero fits into very different decks.

I would call it a very well-rounded final-four... despite some noted fan favorites missing.

 

Once again, I’ve included a voting card (see below) that should help alleviate everyone re-typing everything. Just copy, paste, and delete whichever names you are not voting for.

BL: Beregond - I think Beregond is pretty bad since some shadow cards just eliminate him and Sam is just bleh.  I guess I'll vote for Beregond because he is good in some scenario without those particular shadow cards and his art makes him look pretty dashing.

BM: Theoden (S) - Once again, I can't vote for Gandalf because of how restrictive he is in multi-player.  Theoden really opened up the Rohan deck so I'm happy to give him my vote.

BL: Sam Gamgee v Beregond:  I just use him more in decks than Sam. He's the go to hero when you need a tactics defender, barring Beorn and Boromir shenanigans. Sam's not bad by any means, good will, splashable leadership, self readying, Hobbit trait... It's just that Beregond has that sweet helmet...
BM: Gandalf v Théoden (S): Another tough choice. Theodan because he does a lot for Rohan decks. Plus his two attachments are fun to use. And he's Santa!

BL: Sam Gamgee - easiest choice of the tournament. Beregond is a fairly boring and one dimensional hero often used as a crutch.

BM: Théoden (S) - not sure why Gandalf is still here - I would certainly have voted for Elrond. Spirit Théoden really opens up the Rohan deck type, which can be quite fun.

BL: Sam Gamgee: It pains me to not vote Magali, But, I just plain love Sam.

Wow, cool to see that we are not going to have any repeat champions this year either.

 

BL: Sam Gamgee -- I think he'll go all the way.  He got very far last year too... this is the year, Sam!
BM: Théoden (S) is more fun for me as he is an archetype-enabler.  Gandalf can be fun but he's fiddly to the max if you're using his toys, and removes the element of surprise out of my player deck draw.  Not always what I'm looking for, so I haven't used him all that much.  I am not sure Theoden deserves to win the championship but I'd rather see Theoden vs Sam because the little Hobbit would murder the man of Rohan!

oh god... literally only 1 hero I voted for in the last round made it... and I very recently took him out of my hero line up in my decks....

beregond... the absolute most boring defender somehow robbed legolas.... stupid nevershouldhavebeenmade gandalf beat elrond.... AND theoden beat Aragorn..... looks like Sam will win at this point, pretty sure he came second to Legolas in the first hero championship so honestly he deserves it the most at this point. Not to mention the fact that all the other heroes at this point except for Gandalf are rather average compared to Sam who is easily the best hobbit. As far as my votes go:

 

BL: Sam Gamgee. Beregond sucks. he is boring and outclassed by other defenders, his art is probably the best thing about him, enough said. 
BM: Theoden (S). I would vote for anyone over Gandalf in this match up, yes even he/she Amarthiul, even spirit pippin or fatty for that matter. Gandalf is dodgy and OP and does not deserve to win this championship at all. plus it is christmas and spirit theoden is Santa after all!

Elrond just can't catch a break!

Sam: Go Sam!  He is one of the best heroes in the game and absolutely deserves to win the whole thing.  He's good in a bunch of different decks, and he absolutely shines in campaign mode.

Gandalf: As much as I enjoy Theoden, and as helpful and fun as he is in Rohan decks now, I've got to give the nod to Gandalf.  I'm splitting the finest of hairs between them, but the card that really makes Rohan awesome is Gamling.  Theoden helps a ton, but you really need Gamling on the table to make the deck sing.  And as good as he is, he really only fits into one deck type.  Big G can be overpowered nonsense, but he can also breathe life into dead cards and carry decks that would otherwise be awful.  There's just a lot of creative possibilities he opens up because he fixes what is wrong with a deck.  I ran a Gandalf, Dwalin Nori deck that worked, mostly because of Gandalf's greatness.  Haven't build a deck with him and Erestor in it, but I'm sure it's fun.  Anyway, I understand the hating on Gandalf, but I choose to see his positive qualities.  And I hope that Same wins the whole thing.

If anyone had asked me to predict this final 4 I would never have guessed it, but I have the exact opposite reaction as PsychoRocka (and somewhat feel sorry for him) as every hero I vote for seems to win and basically this is my dream final 4, except I would put Hama in ahead of Beregond. At this point I am supporting Gandalf for the win, but I would be happy with anyone. From the votes above it seems clear that Beregond will get wiped out. That seems fine. Overall, I am living the dream this year :-)

Sam: high quality, low threat heroes are so rare and so valuable. You can put them in any deck and they serve as excellent sidekicks for any power hero. Sam is all the more amazing for being in purple, which benefits more than any other color from low threat. His flavor and art is also spot on, and as said before, he shines in the Saga quests. In my campaign I made it a strategy decision to make Sam as powerful as possible and I resurrected him with "beyond all hope". A powerhouse Sam is a lot of fun.

Gandalf.

Sam - My pick to win it for this year!

Theoden - Theoden really ushered in the era of Rohan decks working well, and I've enjoyed using him ever since he came out. I'm actually not opposed to the Gandalf hero, but every time I try to deckbuild with him he kind of takes over the deck and then I don't have room to do anything else with the deck.

 

Actually, come to think of it, I don't think I've seen a deck with Gandalf hero in it that wasn't your standard Gandalf-Elrond-Spirfindel deck. If anyone has a Gandalf deck that's sufficiently different from that, I'd love to see it. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

BL: Sam Gamgee v Beregond

 

Sam is a flexible, splashable, 3-willpower, Leadership Hobbit, who works wonders in a Hobbit deck and is great in many others . Beregond ist a simple, ressource-saving (very good) defender, who is only here, because he was matched against Legolas, who is a simple, progress-making (very good) attacker. There is no point speaking for Beregond in this matchup.

 

BM: Gandalf v Théoden (S)

 

I really don't get why Théoden gets all the love, but Dain, Celeborn, Hirluin and Boromir (Le) aren't even close to him. They all enable a specific trait (Rohan, dwarfs, Silvans, Outlands, Gondor) in more or less different ways (cost reduction, stat boost while ready, stat boost for 1 round after playing, paying for all spheres and getting buffed, stat boost while holding a ressource). I guess Théoden is just new and a Rohan-Deck wasn't that great without him.

Gandalf is a strong hero, who allows many cool and powerful combos. I guess many people just see the Gandalf-Elrond-Spiritfindel-Combo and claim, that Gandalf is OP. I would say that, if anything, Elrond and his ring are OP, even more with Gandalf. Having a 5 threat hero with awesome stats to complete the hero line-up helps too. Of Course this is the strongest deck you can build with Gandalf, but his balanced stats allow Gandalf to be part of any deck and his toys help him in this regard, as all of them can be used in different situations (the staff being a prime example).

All in all we have a Spirit-hero, who isn't that much different than the other trait enablers and sets-up a Rohan deck, against a flexible stat-powerhouse, who is often disliked, because a deck exists, in which his ability makes an other hero with his attachment completly absurd. Elrond should get the hate for making it possible to cheat every ally, attachment and some events into play for free, not Gandalf, who, if not combined with expert-treasure hunter, only gives you ONE more card to play with during the entire game (seeing the next card in your deck and being able to play it equals one extra card drawn at the beginning of the game, as the card on top of your deck would be the one in your hand, from your latest draw)

 

I'm sorry if this reads like a little rant, I just don't understand why some people vote against Gandalf for being OP/boring :huh: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_huh.png]

BL: Sam Gamgee - While Beregond stood out fom Legolas for great defence being a lot rarer than good attack, pitted against Sam I have to give the vote for the Hobbit's versatility.

 

BM: Gandalf - All the love for Theoden has made me think I should probably try again to build a decent Rohan deck with him, but again, versatility. Theoden does one type of deck which has never been especially interesting to me. Gandalf is incredibly powerful and enables a multitude of possible decks, many of which can be fascinating to play around with.

Well, plenty of people have built their own versions of Gandalf/Elrond/Galadriel, but that's probably not so different. IIRC, DukeWellington has a Gandalf/Hama/Glorfindel deck which apparently beats most everything. Glaurung did a couple of videos a while back using Gandalf/Beregond/Glorfindel and Gandalf/Boromir/Glorfindel. I'm sure there are other Gandalf decks floating around.

For myself, I have Gandalf/Frodo/Bifur (that one's specifically focused on Gandalf and toys), Gandalf/Balin/Bifur (for a mixture of Gandalf and some Dwarf synergy), I started a Theoden/Galadriel/Gandalf deck (Spirit Rohan using Gandalf to splash other spheres) but never finished it, I've played around a fair bit with using Gandalf to help enable Smoke Rings using Gandalf/Merry/Fatty Bolger (so with ally Bilbo I can have 3 Hobbit Pipes plus Wizard Pipe for Smoke Rings) including playing through a solo campaign using that lineup which has just made it to Helm's Deep; and finally my favourite use of Gandalf is this [https://wardenofarnor.wordpress.com/2015/10/10/deck-the-charge-of-harrowdale/], where I'm using him primarily just for his sollid stats and sphere-smoothing to power up Dunhere while remaining mostly mono-Spirit.

Like I said above, he enables a multitude of decks. I've barely scratched the surface of all the possibilities.

I have a Spirfindel, Galadriel, Gandalf deck which I use to win a quest when I cannot with other decks.

BL: Sam Gamgee - It's sad to be kicking Beregond out, but as has been pointed out many times already, Sam is so flexible that he works in just about any deck. Plus, it's always exciting to activate his ability.

BM: Gandalf - Gandy for #1!

 

> BH: Sam Gamgee - Gardener, ring-bearer, mayor, chef. So many additional traits that could be explored with Master Samwise!

 

I would be so keen to make a Chef deck: Second Breakfast, Cram, Lembas, Athelas, Brace of Coneys, Miruvor. Really, all we need now is a Taters! card.

BN: Gandalf - I love Sam, but I dont' even see this as a contest. Gandalf enables a multitude of fascinating options, he's amazing, and all his serious competition went out earlier in the championship. As far as I'm concerned, the only real challenger he actually faced directly was Elrond, and as soon as I picked him for that one he was locked in all the way to the victory for me. Sam's nice, but he's just not on the same level.
3P: Théoden (S) - Theoden enables a fun deck archetype (which admittedly I haven't played that much). Beregond just sits behind his shield. As a general rule, I'll take the intricate over the straightforward (this applies equally to my vote in the final matchup).

I wouldn't be surprised, if Sam wins and maybe I give him not enough credit for his stats and effect combined with his threat, but this isn't a fully objective contest :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

I would argue that both of them are powerful without attachments. The attachments make them better, but they do not require them to be powerful.

(I also would consider Gandalf more versatile than Sam, but that's a personal impression)

 

> BN: Sam Gamgee: he's had a long journey to get here and deserves the win.

Surely so has Gandalf? :huh: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_huh.png] Anyone who makes it to the final has had an equally long journey (unless one of the bottom 6 seeds made it all the way from their first miniature round, then they would've had a slightly longer journey). Obviously, you vote whichever way you like, I just find "he's had a long journey" an odd comment to make in support of it.

Maybe because he came second to Legolas the first year this competition was run?

or perhaps because he was released so long ago and has been around so much longer than the Gandalf hero?

Just guesses as to what he may mean.

Yikes... didn't think my comment would cause controversy.

A long journey within this bracket means Sam defeated Glorfindel, Galadriel, and Frodo. All of which were tough (symbolically or otherwise). This is also his third championship and he's done well in all of them.

With regard to the lore, as a ring bearer, wouldn't each of Sam's steps with the ring count for, say, 1000 miles traversed by Gandalf?

3P: Beregond v Théoden (S)

 

There have been a lot of tough choices in this tournament - but not in the last two rounds. Sam is an excellent hero that can fit into a wide variety of decks... any deck Gandalf is in becomes a Gandalf deck (sure, you can change up the cards... but Gandalf is always the most important one). Theoden (S) enables an entire deck type, while Beregond is the definition of a one dimensional hero.

It's sort of strange to me that people hate Glorfindel because he is so ubiquitous, but then people in here vote for Sam for the very same reason :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]  I wonder why Sam gets a pass but Glorfindel does not.

There are other problems with Glorfindel than his ubiquity. Also, if you find Sam to be as ubiquitous as Glorfindel then your experience is decidedly not the norm.

All I see is conjecture.  Do you have Glorfindel statistics versus Sam statistics?  My limited experience with public groups is that Sam was in each of the 4-player games at both fellowship events I've attended.  Glorfindel was not.  Yet, all I could hear was the tables who had Glorfindel complaining about Glorfindel being in every game...

I would actually love to see a statistical analysis of hero usage over time--I've considered doing it myself a few times but I never seem to find the time.

 

I'm not quite sure where the data would come from though. Cardgamedb, perhaps? Maybe the Strategy and deck-building forum?

It would be very hard to get an unbiased sample, unfortunately.  Not all players use the forums and such being the main problem.  Regardless, I agree it would be fun to see such stats of forum users.

Well deserved!

 

Also nice to see Beregond taking down Théoden, proving more or less, that flexability is higher valued than faction boosting.

Way to go Sam!

Beating Gandalf like that.

 

 

Next year a lore hero gets to be the champ tho.

We've had every sphere but lore now :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

Elrond missed his chance. He is "old news" now.  He may eventually win if people choose to vote against previous winners because they don't want to have the same hero win twice.  This happened to Galadriel this year so it wouldn't surprise me if it happens to each successive winner.  Although, I have a feeling Sam will be immune to this effect due to people voting for him because they see him as the "underdog" even though he is evidently the top dog.

 

We also will never have a Dwarf winner (unless they release a new, relatively strong one right around the time this tournament is hosted). People seem to be bored with Dwarves around these parts.

Dori 2016.

 

 

Can't hurt to start early.

Rats, forgot to vote in the last round! I'm very pleased that Beregond managed to take third place, and I'll begrudgingly allow Sam his victory. Being ageless, Gandalf just needs to wait a few hundred years and compete again then. Thanks very much Thanatopsis for running such an enjoyable tournament!

Just necro-ing this thread briefly to mention that while playing around on RingsDB I decided on a whim to build a deck specifically using the three winners we've had in the hero championship - Sam/Legolas/Galadriel. Link if anyone's interested: http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/506/we-are-the-champions-1.0 [http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/506/we-are-the-champions-1.0]
