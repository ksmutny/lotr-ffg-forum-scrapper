Since characters are considered to be questing until the end of the quest phase, can I use Elevenses to ready my questing Hobbit characters after the quest resolves? In effect, allowing my Hobbits to quest successfully and then readying them afterward?

 

1) Send Hobbits on quest

2) Staging step

3) Quest resolves (success or fail)

4) Play Elevenses to ready questing Hobbit characters

5) Quest Phase ends

 

Is this correct?

Well, I congratulate you on violating the probable intent of the card wonderfully, but your plan seems plausible from a card text and rules perspective.

Reminds me of the trick of playing spirit Bofur post-quest resolution, so you get him guaranteed for only a single resource.

Still, I worry about the part of the card that says "Play only after the staging step." This might mean you can only play it during the green box associated with the staging step, rather than anytime at all after the staging step. This interpretation would ruin your plan.

That is a good point and that might be the case. I was thinking that since the rulebook has a green box at the very end of the Quest Phase that that would be a valid time to try this effect.

This is a fairly new card too so I think I would be surprised if this interaction was not considered.

I already ask this to Caleb and the answer was:



> In order to play Elevenses, you must play it immediately after the staging step resolves. You cannot wait until resolving the quest to play the card.

Thank you for that @Rouxxor [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/308704-rouxxor/] that is certainly clear. How are you able to ask Caleb rules questions directly?

Click "customer service" at the bottom of this page, and then there will be a link to "Rules questions."  In the event that there is no clear answer to a question available from other resources (reading the FAQ, careful reading of the manual and rules inserts, asking community members for help here on the forums), you can submit a rules question directly to the developers using that link.

I believe it was ruled that you cannot, in fact, cheat Bofur onto the board this way: the "if you quest successfully this phase" of his effect is considered to read "if you quest/quested successfully this phase".

Yes, but if you didn't quest successfully then you can bring him in for 1 resource after quest resolution (instead of bringing him in before resolution and questing successfully but having him return to your hand).
