What happens if you complete 2B before 1B in Riddles in the Dark? 

Do you still have to answer riddles even if the objective is complete and risk damaging Bilbo if you fail? Or do riddle cards get discarded/stay with their regualr when revealed effects one that objective is complete?

The game continues unchanged until both 1B and 2B have sufficient progress tokens on them.  You can choose to simply add cards to the staging area instead of answering them as riddles, but there are still some treachery cards ("It Likes Riddles") that will force you to answer riddles.  Yup, Gollum can still eat Bilbo.

So if I get 14 tokens on "out of the frying pan". I still need to activate it's forced effect until I get 9 tokens on "riddles in the dark"? Harsh. I think I need to go back and beat this one again...whoops
