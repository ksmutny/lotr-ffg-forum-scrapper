Poor Erebor Battle Master - but I do agree with the fix.

Ah man, not the Erebor Battle Master, or as I like to call him... the Angry Garden Gnome.

Yeah, with 3 Dwarf heroes and Dain in play, you could get a 5 attack Battle Master as soon as it hit the table (with no other allies in play). It was too broken, so this is a fix I agree with.

I didn't notice that the designers "errata'd" their own point to being no more able to attach attachments to cards that are immune to player cards. That was quite surprising.

Treasure Hunter Fix is also expected....

 

The Next Player rules should also tell use exactly how First and Last player works for solo... I have always played First and Last hits but Next returns Null?

Does this change that card in Road to Rivendell where you choose either all engaged enemies attack or deal damage to everyone and gaining surge? If there are no enemies engaged would you have to deal damage?

hasn't it always been like that... I mean a attachment is a player card ... so if it is immune.. how can you attach it?

this was always the case (if I understand you correctly); from The Long Dark Rules Sheet:

 

Next Player

The next player is the player sitting directly to the left of the player referenced by the card effect. If there are no other players in the game, there is no next player.

yeah.. exactly. It has just been put in the FAQ.. but they still haven't defined FIRST and LAST player for solo... I still play them as returning a target value.. not null like "Next Player".

Oh! Nice idea! Grrrrr, too late to find out it: in 4 players, each player has 3 copies of Treasure Hunter, and always a player has any copy of it attach to the player who has 1 copy of NeedPath. In 2 or 3 rounds this powerfull attachment is in hand, of course! ((9 copies of Treasure Hunter in play by only one player: and he always say 'attachment', wow, drawing powerfull machine, in adittion to find NeedPath) Maybe this is the reason for TH is fixed?

 

Erebor Battle Master only miss 3 attack points, not so bad. When i saw his name in the announcement of the new errata i was hoping anything worse, lol.

It's in the Long Dark rules. Solo you are both First and Last, but not Next

No as Dain and I said.. there is no definition for First and Last players in regards to Solo. It is NOT in The Long Dark Rule Sheet.. that is where the Next Player rules were introduced. Still I think it is pretty clear.. yet it should be defined properly in the FAQ.

Loragorn is also ok. So those dooms cards from VOI should be not so powerful then if they don't scare Loragorn.

## 18 [GrandSpleen on February 7, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/98638-and-a-new-faq/?do=findComment&comment=976532)

I don't see the logic in distinguishing Quick Strike (which is legal against Immune enemies) and Hands Upon the Bow (which is now illegal).  I can see maybe why they would want to do that from a balance standpoint, but I don't really follow their logic in establishing that balance.  

 

Quick Strike:

Action: Exhaust a character you control to immediately declare it as an attacker (and resolve its attack) against any eligible enemy target.

 

Hands Upon the Bow:

Action: Exhaust a character you control with ranged to immediately declare it as an attacker (and resolve its attack) against an enemy in the staging area. It gets +1 Attack during this attack.

 

The text I highlighted red is identical between both cards.  "Any eligible enemy" and "an enemy in the staging area" are the only meaningful difference.  Somehow the phrase "any eligible enemy" does NOT force the player to "pick" an enemy, but "an enemy in the staging area" DOES force a player to "pick" an enemy.

 

I was really happy to see that they expanded on "immunity," as this is something we have sorely needed.  But all they have done is muddy the already murky waters.  If they wanted to exempt enemies from being targeted by Hands Upon the Bow, they should have just errata'd the card.  This messy explanation doesn't make anything clearer.  The next time a card comes out and we have a question about using it vs. immune enemies, we have NO new answers to look to from this passage.  The same debates will just recycle.  Does it make you pick an enemy, or doesn't it? Who knows, ask the devs!

One is a TARGET effect, the other triggers a non targeted COMBAT ACTION

## 20 [GrandSpleen on February 7, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/98638-and-a-new-faq/?do=findComment&comment=976609)

But but but.... which one is a "target" effect?  The one that uses the text "Target?"  Actually, that would be Quick Strike!

 

And neither are "Combat Actions," although maybe you just chose unfortunate wording there.  Feint is a Combat Action.  Quick Strike and Hands Upon the Bow are regular Actions.

 

Neither Quick Strike nor Hands Upon the Bow instruct the player to "chose a character"  or "target a character" (i.e., a PLAYER character).  That is why the ruling is ludicrous.  They use almost identical text.  A character is exhausted (cost) to allow an immediate attack (framework effect).  Hands Upon the Bow allows this attack to occur against an enemy in the staging area (this effect is different from the typical framework of the game).  If they want to differentiate the two cards, THAT is how they could do it.  But instead they are suggesting that one card targets a character and the other card targets an enemy-- so the text on the cards needs to be distinctly different.

 

So in the end the only thing we can compare between the two cards is :

 

"an enemy in the staging area"

 

vs.

 

"any eligible enemy target."

 

Which word in which clause means that Card A targets a character, while card B targets an enemy?

umm... combat action is incorrect term you are right.. I the new sub-set of actions is still pretty new sorry.

 

I'll try to step by step it....

 * Quick Strike is targeting the playe'rs CHARACTER, not the immune card
 * That initialises the "player attack sub-phase" of a combat round.
 * This is just like a normal attack in a normal combat round.
 * The player card event is not targeting the immune card at any time, it is using the combat round rules to select the target of the attack.
 * This is an example of a "non-targeted" effect. As while .. yes it it HITS a target.. there was no selecting of the target outside of normal rules. All quick strike did was play that combat step out of round.
 * You wouldn't expect "immune to player cards" to mean you can not attack them in a normal combat round would you?

Meanwhile...

 

 * Hands Upon the Bow as part of its cost requires a targeting for the event, AND to tap a player character.
 * So if the card is immune it can not be selected as a target and thus the effect fizzles.

Yes it is pretty similar but it IS different and the design space needs to recognise this for the game to make sense. You see this a lot in card games. The easiest way to think of this is that QuickStrike has no conditional text about the target, meaning there is no target.. you can just attack anything legal... but Hands Upon the Bow can only attack certain targets.. targets you need to nominate in a special way outside of the normal combat round rules. The rules that allow you to target out side those rules is on the player card's event text.. that is a player card effect.. and encounter cards can be immune to that.

 

That is pretty much it.. so like kinda like I said..

 

One is a TARGET effect, the other triggers a NON-TARGETED effect.

No, no, no, you are supposed to say, "Grandspleen, you are right.  The wording on the two cards is identical.  This is ridiculous, but we must let it be."

 

OK, so maybe not... but anyway, all we can do is be apologists for the ruling.  The card text on both cards is written nearly identically.  The motivation was clearly to exclude Hands from being used on Immune characters, but they tackled the problem from a weird angle.  

 

>  * Hands Upon the Bow as part of its cost requires a targeting for the event, AND to tap a player character.

 

That's not right, the cost for neither card requires targeting.  I don't think I am missing any errata, but Hands is written:

 

Action: Exhaust a character you control with ranged to immediately declare it as an attacker (and resolve its attack) against an enemy in the staging area. It gets +1 Attack during this attack.

 

Everything before the word "to" is the "cost."  So you have to break it down this way:

 

COST: "Exhaust a character you control with ranged"

 

EFFECT: "immediately declare it as an attacker ... etc"

 

The "cost" for Hands and Quick Strike are identical, word for word, except for the "ranged" part.  It is the "effect" that's different.  All I can do is repeat myself I guess: if the cards can possibly be analyzed differently, it has to be in the text "an enemy in the staging area" vs. "any eligible enemy target."  It has to be that way, or the  foundation for the rules of the game (literal readings of cards) is undermined.

 

And I really don't want this game to go down the route of considering the semantics of "any enemy" vs "an enemy."  Yuck.

... there not identical in anyway. As I said this is a VERY common distinction in many card games.

 

Stop thinking of a combat step where you exhaust to attack.

 

With hand, The exhaust of the player character is a COST not part of the standard exhaust you do during the combat round. Hands says exhaust the player card, AND target a encounter card, and then do a combat-attack step vs the selected target. This is all in the event card text.

 

Quick-Strike targets ONLY the player card.

 

Believe it or not.. not sure I can write this a 4th way.

It IS defined - in the Khazad-Dum rules insert:

 

"Some cards refer to the “last player.” The last player is 
considered to be the player sitting directly to the right of 
the first player. If there is only one player playing, then that 
player is considered to be both the first and last player."

## 26 [booored on February 7, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/98638-and-a-new-faq/?do=findComment&comment=976659)

Neat! Guess that explains why all the old hands are playing it correctly then. Good to know. We were all looking in the Long Dark rule sheet.

 

Still regardless like the "Next Player" ruling it should be added to the FAQ so it is in a easy to locate place.

Yeah this is why the quest log is completely useless. People make mistakes, card rules change.. there is no reason to record anything.. the recorded wins and losses has no meaning until the game is finalised.

I agree whole-heartedly with this. By my count there are now 23 cards that have been errataed (not just clarified but having changes to text).

I would gladly pay a regular AP price to get corrected versions of all the errataed cards.

 You were allowed to attach those things, they just couldn't affect the immune card. "Ancient Mathom" or "Path of Need" are examples that worked while being attached to an immune location, since their effects didn't targt that location

## 29 [booored on February 7, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/98638-and-a-new-faq/?do=findComment&comment=976705)

ahh yes.. I know what you mean now.. sweet. In truth I missed that distinction.

 

Mathom for example I would call the act of placing it ON the location as a target function. A function that would be illegal as the location can not be targeted due to immunity.

 

Either way.. I guess it is mute as they have changed it anyway. I makes a lot more sense this way.

Thanks for trying to explain how this works.  It's very clear how the distinction is "supposed" to work, I just don't see it supported by the card text... at all.  Literally, the wording on the cards is a copy/paste job.  They just added "ranged" and a clause about the staging area.

I agree with GrandSpleen. Hands Upon the Bow does not specify any targeting, it simply changes the definition of "eligible enemy". I have an additional question related to this, which may be answered in the FAQ, but I'm too lazy to look for it right now: Does this also mean that Dunhere can't be used against immune enemies in the staging area? I assume so, considering his ability specifically mentions targeting enemies. Which would mean you can't use Quick Strike plus Dunhere.

The point is that HUtB targets the enemy, as you have to pick him specifically for this attack while Qucik Strike iniiates an attack sequence during which you pick an enemy. The latter doesn't target the enemy directly, the further does.

 

And yes, it's silly, but I long gave up on card game rules following common sense.

 

 

 

ETA:

 

Quick Strike tells your character to start an attack. An immune enemy is not involved here, as he only suffers from the attack itself (which follows the card effect), but not from the card effect.

 

Hands Upon the Bow tells your character to attack an enemy in the staging area. You have to pick that enemy. In that moment the enemy says: "Sorry, immune, can't pick me!" and you can't even start the attack.

Hands Upon the Bow ALSO just initiates an attack sequence during which you pick an enemy. The difference is that change "eligible enemy" to "enemy in the staging area". It seems to me that the rule is based off the fact that if the enemy isn't normally eligible, then it is technically being targetted outside the standard rules. So if the enemy IS normally eligible for the effect, then it's not really an effect against the enemy, but since we're changing the eligibility of an enemy from ineligible to eligible, that counts as targeting it.

## 34 [GrandSpleen on February 7, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/98638-and-a-new-faq/?do=findComment&comment=977027)

That's the idea they put in the FAQ: Quick Strike targets a character only, Hands targets both a character and an enemy.

 

It's just that... the card text...

 

Select Quick Strike. Copy.

 

Select Hands.  Paste.  Add the words "ranged" and "staging area."  And a bit about +1atk.  Voila!  

 

That's all.  The bit about "you have to pick that enemy" is the part that gets lost in the identical text, since you do have to pick an enemy for Quick Strike in the physical world.  If Hands and QS are to be differentiated based on "picking" an enemy, it should be reflected in the text... Hence, they needed to errata Hands, or QS, or make them both illegal plays against immune enemies.

 

As for Dunhere, he doesn't work, nor will Great Yew Bow.  That came out of designer clarification given discussion in the community awhile back.  Dunhere uses the word "target"

The issue with what you said is that it doesn't mention eligibility. You need to pick an enemy either way, otherwise you can't make an attack, which should make the two cards identical in this respect. Hands Upon the Bow does not explicitly state to target/pick an enemy, and neither does Quick Strick; they say to attack an enemy, which is a normal action in the game that isn't considered a card effect. The only difference (besides the obvious +1 attack) is that Hands Upon the Bow is making normally ineligible targets eligible.

 

Please try to understand that I'm not trying to put you down. I just want everyone to understand why GrandSpleen and I were having issues with the distinction between these two cards.

And if they could put missing cards that are only in x1 or x2 in core set... having +1 test of will and +2 unexpected courage would be marvelous.  :wub: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wub.png]

I'm really glad they clarified the Must X or Y vs Must Either X or Y thing, I was looking for an answer to that and couldn't find one for a while.

The most important part is that when it says, "either" you have to choose one that you can do (if you can do either). There have been many games where I just chose the option I couldn't do and made the Treachery card have no effect essentially.

Still does not sound that clear to me:

The Ambush (errated) now reads: "At the beginning of the combat phase, each player must either turn each of his hidden cards faceup, or take 1 hidden card."

 

Even if I have no hidden cards, I could still choose to turn each of my hidden cards (none) and face no effect... No ?

I'd rather apply the rule that says "if ambiguous, interpret as worst case scenario for the player" here.

No, you can only choose an option that you are able to fulfill. Because you have no hidden cards, you can't turn any faceup. You have to turn at least 1 hidden card faceup to satisfy that option, otherwise you have to take the other one.

I'm not certain this is necessarily correct: I would argue that you can chose to turn zero hidden cards face up and therefore fulfil that option. Not 100% confident either way.

I get what you're saying that there is a layer of ambiguity, but I think it's pretty clear that you have to turn at least 1 hidden card face up. Think about it: by a similar logic, if a treachery asked you to deal 1 damage to each ally in play or raise your threat, and you have no allies in play, you can't just say, "i'm dealing 1 damage to zero allies". It's been made clear in the past (and in this FAQ) that you have to fulfill one. You can't pick an option that has no gameplay impact.

Actually, this new FAQ totally answers one of the real questions that really matter :

I was hoping the FAQ would explain the Planning action of Haunted Valley from Stone of Erech.

 

While this location is in the staging area, all ready heroes lose all [Lore], [Leadership], [spirit], and [Tactics] icons.
Planning Action: Exhaust a hero. Any player may trigger this action.          

 

Does this simply mean that a hero must be exhausted during planning?  Since it doesn't say "Forced" I am confused.

The location deprives all "ready" heroes of their icons. It then gives you the option of exhausting a hero during planning as an action. Normally, this is a bad thing, but since they are no longer "ready", that hero would get their resource icon back. Basically, the location gives you a way to get your resource icon back, but at a price.

So you're not required to do it, but it's an option. It's kind of like the action on Zigil Mineshaft.

Ah.  I skipped over the "ready" in the first sentence.  Penalty for reading too fast.  Thanks much.
