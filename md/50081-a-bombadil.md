 While playing this wonderful game for the first time yesterday, my friend proposed that we should call the option to draw new cards a "Bomdadil" instead of a "mulligan." I thought it was a fun idea, and I pass it along for what it is worth!

 That's a fun idea.  Thanks for sharing.

A good one.

Hoping Tom makes the game as an Ally as well though.

Yes i'm hoping for an ability that allows him to pay for song cards, or maybe search your deck for one.

maybe a Gandalf-style "when Tom Bombadil comes into play, choose one of the following- heal all damage on your heroes, or refresh all your heroes" - would need to have a Gandalf style, "discard at the end of the round" to balance it out though.
