So, while I realize it's not as cool as supporting my local gaming store, I largely pick up my LotR expansions through Amazon because my budget is tight and I use a few sites to pick up Amazon gift cards over time so every couple of months I can get a new box or pack.  

 

But Flame of the West has been out for a week or so now and yet there's still no listing on Amazon. New expansions are usually listed quite a bit before they're on sale and then they go up through Amazon and third party sellers after the release date. But it's like it doesn't even exist.  

 

Does anyone have any idea why this would be? I'm really itching to pick up a copy, but I check Amazon every day and still no luck. Did I miss a memo along the way about a delay to certain sellers? Are any other sites or stores having the same issue? Or did Amazon just lose it's mind?

Usually these kind of games are sold on amazon by 3rd party sellers.  If you step back this is kind of a niche market, especially compared to their other products.  So if the 3rd parties are selling out in their brick & motor stores or their own online stores they might not feel the need to list it on amazon.  There are also a few other websites you could go to like coolstuffinc.com and miniaturemarket.com that would have it if you do want to get an online discount.

It's a lot harder to get this stuff now for sure. I'm from NZ and it's bloody hard to buy anything lcg related anymore. If asmodee's goal was to make product more unecessable, they've succeeded.

CoolStuffInc.com is showing it in stock. I haven't ordered it yet so I can't confirm actual availability.

 

None of my local FLGS's support LotR LCG to any extent.

You can't just ask them to make a special one-off order and hold it for you?

Yeah, if you have a FLGS that already has FFG stuff on the shelf, they should be able to get LotR packs easily from their regular distributor.

EDIT: I wonder how I managed to post in the wrong thread.
