I'm pretty sure this must've been answered already, but I can't find a reference... Does Loragorn's once-per-game (per player) ability reset if he gets killed then resurrected via Fortune or Fate/Landroval?

This would also be relevant to Galdor. And what about Tactics Eowyn?

No. Per player means per player in contrast to all other limits which are per card. That's the whole point, otherwise Landroval could have as many uses as you liked because every time he re-entered play he'd be considered a different Landroval.

He isn't?

He is considered a different Landroval each time, but you can't trigger his ability again because limit once per game is checked by player rather than by card.

Boo. I guess part of our team unknowingly cheated through A Knife In The Dark.
