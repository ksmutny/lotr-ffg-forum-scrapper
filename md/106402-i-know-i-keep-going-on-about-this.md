but...really...when are we ever going to see an art book? if any game cries out for one..it is THIS one!! :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

Does anyone know how common it is for ffg to do this - as a photographer who has self published in the past, I know well the cost of printing art that looks great, as it should for a game like this...so I know its doubtful ffg would make much money...but is there any chance? ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

What a rich idea! Bring it on!

I don't care that much. See, I've purchased several prints from Magali Villeneuve and maybe the other artists are willing to sell the prints as well. A ~20x30 cm print looks better than a book, in my humble opinion.

What a great idea! I just love the artwork, it is as much important to me in this game as the gameplay itself. Sometimes I even find it hard to play the "ugly" cards.

 

Knowing my euphoric attitude toward everything LoTR LCG related I would likely try to get such art book even if the costs were steep. And probably not only me. I think the general consenus among the players is that the card art is fantastic. There are players of course who simply do not care much about that side of LoTR LCG, but even from among them I have yet to hear that the art is weak.

 

It is just that FFG might have acquired licences for the art exclusively for the purpose of producing the game and gaming accessories. I have absolutely no idea if this is true, but in such case they would probably need to renegotiate with the artists and pay them more for the rights to publish an art book. This could make the whole endeavor potentially worthless commercially for them. 

 

But hey, you can seriously buy prints from Magali? cool, I will check it out at once. (Edit: okay, it seems they are not shipping to my country. So bring on the art book!)
