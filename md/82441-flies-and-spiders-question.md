so when you create 2 staging areas, 1st player gets bilbo (who stays there as the token doesnt move) and the other players get spiders glade

you need to exhuast bilbo to travel to the glade, however you can't interact with each other's staging area

how does this work then?

thanks

This is a little like FoS. Yes, the first player cannot interact with the other players so this means that until the first player defeats his quest stage the other players are going to get 1 spider per turn because of the spider´s glade (2 if 3 or 4 players). When you finish your quest stage and you join the other players you can exhaust Bilbo to travel to the spider´s glade.
