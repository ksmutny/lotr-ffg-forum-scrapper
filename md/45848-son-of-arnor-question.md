# [Son Of Arnor question?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45848-son-of-arnor-question/)

"Response: After Son of Arnor enters play, choose an enemy card in the staging area or currently engaged with another player. Engage that enemy."

 

What am I missing here or is this card just "the suck"?

 

You engage an enemy outside of the normal Engagement Phase.  But you don't do combat yet as per the text of Son Of Arnor because it doesn't say 'then do combat' or 'attack it' or something like that.  So you wait around to the Combat phase.  The the Enemy cards attack first.  The Son Of Arnor dies horribly because it has *zero* defense - no damage to the Enemy you engaged, SOA just dies.

 

Is that the point of this card?  Just a buffer to slow down Enemy?  If so seems kind of a spendy buffer for the cost of 3 resources....

It pulls the enemy out of the Staging Area so you don't need to deal with its threat value.

In the 2nd quest during the 2nd phase of that quest you can only pull 1 monster normally. He allows you to engage another monster.

Just some thoughts.

Here you can find a previous discussion of the card:

 There is also a sneaky way of allowing one enemy to not attack for one turn. Lets say you are the first player and your partner is engaged with a Hill Troll (or whatever). In the Combat phase you let all your enemies attack you as normal, then it becomes your partners turn to defend. But before any attack gets resolved, you play Sneak Attack + Son of Arnor moving that Hill Troll to your side, which now has no legal attack window left. And you got 2 extra ATK to hurt the Troll this turn.

This particular combo will NOT work.  Page 31 of the rulebook on the Turn Sequence - there is no window after you resolve attacks against you for you to play a card and pull the Enemy to your side of the table.

It will work.  Read page 18, under Resolving Enemy Attacks:

Players may play event cards and take
actions at the end of each step.

So you can do it after step 4.

Edit: Nevermind, I am wrong.  If you use the Sneak Attack after step 4 of the 1st player's last attack, they now have an additional eligible attacker (Hill Troll) who immediately attacks them.  I'm not clear on what would happen if you used this after step 1 during player 2's attack resolution.  But it seems pretty clear this combo would work if player 2 is engaged with 2 enemies, as you could play Sneak Attack any time during the resolution of the first engaged enemy, allowing you to disengage the 2nd enemy before it can attack.

## 8 [Ismar on April 27, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45848-son-of-arnor-question/?do=findComment&comment=459850)

This card is great to engage the pesky goblin sniper.  It's also good to help out your questing partner, when they are the first player and multiple monsters are in the staging area, by allowing you to voluntarily engage a second monster the turn the card is played.

 

Very useful catd IMHO.

 

Thanks,

Yeah, the flowchart is a poor guide.  And yeah, even if you follow the steps on Page 18 and play Sneak Attack+Son Of Arnor, the attack still resolves and someone is taking damage.  There is no way to take zero damage in this case.  Which means, this combo still does not work.

## 10 [Entropy42 on April 27, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45848-son-of-arnor-question/?do=findComment&comment=459883)

Why doesn't the combo work if you play it during the resolution of the 2nd players 1st engagement?  (Assuming he's engaged with Hill Troll and 1 other thing)

In that case, you are engaging the Hill Troll after your defense round is over, but before he attacks your opponent.

The reason is the timing of the Combat Phase and the exact wording of the Combat Phase steps and your insertion of words into it that do not exist in the rulebook.  The Combat Phase is per turn, not per player - a per turn Phase wherein enemy attacks are resolved one by one.

Attacks are resolved per enemy.  You repeat steps 1 to 4 of the Combat Phase for each Enemy card.  Just because you resolved all enemy attacks against you, that doesn't mean the attacks of enemies engaged by other players are resolved yet, nor is there such a thing as your "Defense Round".  You resolve attacks against the First Player first, but that doesn't mean the First Player has a "Defense Round" - which means if an enemy gets pulled to you, for whatever reason, but its attack is not resolved, it still attacks you since attacks are resolved per enemy.

 

The Combat Phase rules on Page 18 give you the steps for resolving enemy attacks, and merely gives you the order of starting with the first player and going clockwise from there, resolving enemy attacks one at a time.  Even though an enemy is engaged with your allied player, that enemy attack will resolve fully once picked.

 

But let's say you use SOA immediately after attacks against you are resolved, so before your allied player goes.  Play has not passed to your allied player because he/she has yet to execute Step 1-Choose An Enemy.  You then still have to pick an enemy, then a defender, resolve shadow effect, etc. at that point.  Which means the enemy attacks will still deal out damage against you.

 

Now let's say you use SOA immediately your allied player chooses an enemy as per Step 1-Choose An Enemy.  That enemy attack is still resolving and you still have to do Step 2-Pick A Defender.  Your allied player is no longer engaged with that enemy and cannot pick a Defender.  You get to pick defender if you want since you are now engaged with that enemy during the Pick A Defender step of *that enemy's attack*.  Which means it still does damage.

 

Either way, someone is taking damage.

No offense, but where do you see this?  Per the rules on page 18:

"The first player then repeats these 4 steps for each enemy that he is engaged with. After the first player has resolved all enemy attacks against himself, the player to his left resolves the attacks his enemies are making against him, following steps 1-4 in turn for each enemy. If playing with more than 2 players, proceed clockwise around the table with each player resolving all of his enemies’ attacks." (emphasis mine)

Attacks are resolved per enemy, per player.  Once a player has resolved all of their enemy's attacks, you move on to the next player, who then resolves all their enemy's attacks, and so on.

In other words, this combo works just fine in the example given.

I could ask you the same thing about your notion of "Defense Round" - where is that in the rulebook?  It isn't.

 

Your answer is right in front of you from Page 18, and you even quoted it yourself:   "After the first player has resolved all enemy attacks against himself, the player to his left resolves the attacks his enemies are making against him, following steps 1-4 in turn for each enemy."

 

Your allied player picks an enemy as per Step 1.  That enemy's attack is now resolving.  You play Sneak Attack+SOA.  ***The enemy attack is still resolving.***  (There is nothing in the resolution steps that, or in SA+SOA, prevents this continued attack resolution.)  The resolution of that enemy's attack now moves to Step2 where a defender is picked... then step 3 and step 4.

 

In other words, this combo still doesn't work like you think it does.

When did I mention a "Defense Round"? sorpresa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sorpresa.gif]

 

You may be misinterpreting the rule question.  Here's the scenario:

You are player 1 in a two-player game.  You have one Enemy engaged; player 2 has two Enemies.  You resolve the Enemy attacking you, then you move on to player 2's Enemies.  In the middle of resolving player 2's first Enemy attack, you play Sneak Attack and Son of Arnor, engaging the Enemy that has not yet begun to resolve its attack.  After the Enemy's attack resolves, player 2 has no other Enemies engaged with him to resolve, so players move onto Attacking Enemies. This is explained with the rule I quoted as well as delineated in the Combat Phase Turn Sequence breakdown on pg. 31.

In other words, each player resolves attacks from all engaged Enemies in player order; you don't continually go around the table until all engaged Enemies have attacked.

Sorry, different user referenced a "defense round", which doesn't exist.

 

Your scenario still doesn't work.  You still haven't fulfilled this basic requirement/tenet of the Combat Phase as per page 18: "All enemies that are engaged with the players attack each round, and the players resolve those attacks one at a time."

 

You still have an enemy that hasn't attacked.  Starting with the first player is just that, a starting point.  You go around resolving enemy attacks one by one.  All enemies still resolve all of their attacks.

 

Think about this as well:  If it worked the way you want it to, it would be possible to pass enemies around to different players ad nauseum ad infinitum and *never* have any of their attacks resolve, ever.  Which makes no sense of course, and *if* it did exist I am pretty darn sure the rules hole for that would be clamped shut right quick.

I have fulfilled the requirement of the Combat Phase: Player 1's attacks have resolved, Player 2's attacks have resolved.  You don't go back to Player 1. Again, look at the Turn Sequence of the Combat Phase to understand this.

Unless otherwise specified through some sort of card effect, engaged Enemies stay engaged with the same player.  How would they be able to be "passed around ad nauseum ad infinitum", just out of curiosity?

You are incorrect.  There is a turn sequence.  It is spelled out on pg. 18:"After the first player has resolved all enemy attacks against himself, the player to his left resolves the attacks his enemies are making against him, following steps 1-4 in turn for each enemy. If playing with more than 2 players, proceed clockwise around the table with each player resolving all of his enemies’ attacks." and also in the Turn Sequence of the Combat Phase.   How is this not a turn sequence?

 I am pretty positive that this Combo even works, if the second player has only one enemy engaged with him. The relevant part for my argumentation is the Turn Sequence chart on pages 30 and 31.

Under Phase 6, the Combat Phase, there is a step labelled "Next player resolves attacks made by his enemies against him, etc.".

This step is highlighted in green, which implies that actions can be taken by either player even before any part of any attack against the second player gets resolved. And afterwards the enemy is not longer engaged with player two, while the step for attacking player one has passed...

There's no need to get so nasty about it, I was just trying to understand why the combo didn't work in the scenario I proposed.  I was not claiming "defense round" to be an actual turn structure, I was just using that as shorthand for saying I have finished defending and we are resolving the next player's attacks.  That's why I didn't capitalize it.

The 2 scenarios you wrote were not what I was asking about.  Zambo has already clarified what I was asking though.  I'll take his word for it that combat does not "cycle back around" to the first player to look for more viable attacks.

I think the rules are pretty unclear about what happens if you play Son of Arnor after each step of Resolving Enemy Attacks.  If I "steal" the enemy from you after step 1, who is the active player?  It seems like I could steal him after step 2 or 3, and then he would still hit your defender, since you've already declared the defender.  If its undefended though, I'm not sure who is the active player, and who would have to assign the damage to a hero.  Pretty minor point either way, at least for now.  Hopefully combat will be spelled out more clearly in the FAQ.

Where is it stated that there is a turn sequence?  The words "turn sequence" do not appear anywhere on Page 18.  You are inserting words onto that page which do not exist.  Here are some words that do exist on Page 18 that I have quoted before, which you continue to ignore:  "All enemies that are engaged with the players attack each round, and the players resolve those attacks one at a time."

 

The principal question remains:  Have all the enemy attacks resolved?  The answer is still no in your scenario.  You have a starting point and a requirement that all enemies engaged with the players attack each round.

 

Play it however you want, I am sure we will get an official ruling one way or the other soon enough.

There was nothing "nasty" about what I posted - no caps, no yelling, etc.  I did post some logic and interpretations to be sure, but there was no name calling or anything like that.

 

I agree with you, there looks to be two ways to interpret this scenario at the moment - at least two camps of thought on the matter.  And yeah, the Combat Phase rules on Page 18 *and* the flowchart on Page 31, could use some serious refining and clarity.  It may be a cooperative LCG, but it is still a card game and as card games are wont to do, they need specific steps and clarity.  I am hoping for an official FAQ soon as well.

On pages 30-31.  The Turn Sequence, specifically: 6. Combat Phase.  That's where it's stated.  This, in addition to the wording on pg. 18 ("The first player then repeats these 4 steps for each enemy that he is engaged with.

The principal question remains:  Have all the enemy attacks resolved?  The answer is still no in your scenario.  You have a starting point and a requirement that all enemies engaged with the players attack each round.

 

Play it however you want, I am sure we will get an official ruling one way or the other soon enough.

Sure, the answer is no.  That's because I'm following the rules as they are written and not presupposing anything.  Nor am I ignoring anything.  I am following the rules.

On pages 30-31. The Turn Sequence, specifically: 6. Combat Phase. That's where it's stated. This, in addition to the wording on pg. 18 ("The first player then repeats these 4 steps for each enemy that he is engaged with. After the first player has resolved all enemy attacks against himself, the player to his left resolves the attacks his enemies are making against him, following steps 1-4 in turn for each enemy. If playing with more than 2 players, proceed clockwise around the table with each player resolving all of his enemies’ attacks.") shows that there is a specific order that engaged enemies attacks resolve.

And yet you still have not resolved all the enemy attacks.


Okay, so now we are discussing the Turn Sequence flow chart on Page 31 and not the Combat Phase rules on Page 18? Okay then.


Under Combat Phase of the Turn Sequence flowchart on page 31 you have this line "Next player resolves attacks made by his enemies against him, etc." Let's say you do you have 4 players. And let's say you do use SA+SOA as you describe in your scenario example. Let's then say you get to the end of all enemy attack resolutions on player 4. Guess what? You still have have one enemy whose attack has not resolved, which means you have not fulfilled the basic requirement of the Combat Phase on Page 18 "All enemies that are engaged with the players attack each round, and the players resolve those attacks one at a time." So, then the Turn Sequence flowchart on page 31 says "Next player resolves attacks made by his enemies against him, etc."


Around and around and around until all enemy attacks have resolved. Starting with the first player is merely that, a starting point. You still have to resolve all enemy attacks, as clearly state on Page 18 and exemplified by the flowchart on page 31....


Sigh. I have made myself clear as can be on this issue or rules interpretation, or at least I think I have anyway.  I don't know who Nate is, or what his email address is, otherwise I'd just hit him up and reference this thread to ask for his help as Toqtamish suggests.  Otherwise, I don't think we are going to get anywhere else but back and forth.

The sequence of events is still a bit confusing at this point. For instance, I used to think Theodred could only contribute an extra resource to a hero who contributed to a quest before he did, but not after since that effect triggered before the next player committed, in order of turns. But I heard its more like its all happening at the same time, so I can still give it to anyone committed to the quest. I'd assume that attacking works the same way- its in an order so each player takes their actions in turn rather than confusingly all at once, but its really happening at the same time. The enemy will attack whoever is in front of it in that phase even if you change their target.

I think Sons of Arnor, like some other cards, are just conditional. They really don't do much for you solo, unless for some reason you want to engage an additional enemy that round who wouldn't normally come from threat. If there are no enemies in staging on other players, its better to wait and not play them unless you want another ally without them pulling something to do (I assume you HAVE to use their effect when they come into play? Or is it a choice?) Sometimes it is good to pre-emptively pull a monster from staging so they're not contributing to questing threat. I think they're best used with Sneak Attack. I've been playing them where I let another player block an attack (like someone with Denethor who can take the hit but not really attack back well) and let the enemy attack part complete, and then Sneak Attack with Sons of Arnor to steal the monster from them to unload on them with attacks since the Sons can contribute to the attack also (for what its worth), since the other player had 1 or no characters left unexhausted, but I had most of my heroes and allies ready to go (I've actually been surprised at how good Leadership can be at combat.) So hopefully I am using them correctly to do so.

After reading this thread, I first thought I agreed with Crow. But then Zambo's argument made sense. It would appear that the order of attack resolution goes player 1-2-3-4-stop. And not player 1-2-3-4-1-2-3-4-etc meaning if player one stole the enemy after resolving all of his own engagements, then the stolen enemy would miss out on attacking regardless of the requirement that "all engaged enemies must attack". Just think of Forest Snare. That enemy is engaged and doesn't attack, so why would it be unfathomable that a stolen one missed his opportunity?

 The question is :

- If I steal an enemy engaged with my partner thanks to the combo Sneak Attack + Son of Arnor, after attacks against me have been made & resolved and before this particular enemy starts his attack against my partner (so I'm the first player obviously), does the enemy stolen and now engaged with me will attack, and who will be the defender ?

My guess is that the enemy doesn't attack and that the combo is perfectly legal but nobody can say he's 100% sure (except Nate of course).

I've sent this one and the "A light in the Dark" timing question to the rules link below but if you are sending this one to Nate, can you seen the Light in the dark one too (they are both related to timings during the combat phase).

The "A light in the Dark" query, is..

When exactly in the combat phase can A light in the dark be played? Can it be played after the shadow card is revealed but before damage is calculated effectively cancelling the enemies attack for that round and the shadow effect, or must it be played before the attack of the specific enemy starts to resolve (before a defender is selected and before the shadow card is revealed)?

Aye, i have already sent both to the rules query link.....

Yes that is how I sent my initial question as well about Ungoliants spawn and the end of a quest. He replies from his email address to you directly at the email you entered in the rules question form. So really its the same thing just different path.

In solo game you also can use him with forest snare combo. You play Son of Arnor in planning phase engage the enemy(troll for example) and play snare on him. Working fine in Leadership/lore deck.

I never got any response from the rules link, so for me at least it's still a bit vague about exactly how this works.

 

It's clear you can play a card at the end of step 3 in combat, but prior to damage being calculated, but if that moves the enemy away from the player being attacked, is damage applied or not?

I don't think that has been covered - I'll add it to the FAQ thread but not sure there is even a concensus of opinion on what should happen is there?

im gonna throw in my two cents here....

according to page 18, "ALL enemies that are engaged with the players attack each round, and the players resolve those attacks one at a time." If you play SOA after you resolve your enemy attacks on another players engaged enemy, you engane it yourself and must resolve the attack after the last player goes.  Page 18 says each player resolves the 4 combat steps for each enemy, then it goes to the next player and so on.  so at first it seems that, all players have made their combat actions and the turn is over, BUT what is the golden rule?  The rulebook cna be overruled by a cards actions (paraphrased).  so even though you resolved all players actions and the flowchart shows you go onto the next phase, the first rule of the combat phase is what i stated above;  All enemies engaged have not yet resolved all their attacks so the turn sequence goes back to the player with the enaged enemy from playing SOA.  Ideally, the flowchart chould have a clause at the end saying "unless a player has been engaged with an enemy after his turn."

I think the resolving of attacks one at a time is more for keeping everything less complicated and confusing.  if everyone were to resolve everything by themselves, then actions/strategies may be overlooks (player 1 could have helped player 2 attack but he was too busy doing his own attacking that he didnt notice, event cards werent played, etc.).  going player, by player, the team can coordinate their attacks/defense accordingly.

 the fact that each enemy 'must' attack doesn't work IMHO.

If I use Feint, it prevents the attack (the FAQ says it must be played before starting the combat phase.... weird but true).

If the combat sequence is looping until all enemies have attacked, than Feint make it impossible to move on.

no it wouldnt be impossible to move on cause the golden rule is that a card can override game rules.  if the rules are "every enemy engaged must attack" and feint says "enemy cannot attack this phase" then the rulebook is overridden and feint takes precedence.  the same with forest snare.  you arent stuck in combat phase cause the engaged enemy doesnt attack you.  forest snare takes precedence and the phase ends and the game continues.

## 43 [Bindlespin on July 14, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45848-son-of-arnor-question/?do=findComment&comment=499894)

 There is no "must" in the wording it just says:" In the combat phase, enemies attack first. All enemies that are engaged with a player attack each round (add golden rule here: unless something interferes like forest snare,feint or whatever), and the players resolve those attacks one at a time." i agree that the whole cycling through players is just explanation on how to resolve enemy attacks one at a time in an orderly fashion with multiple players. Son of Arnor doesn't stop anything from attacking it just changes engagement. As the rules are now you probably can interrupt the resolution of an attack with Son of Arnor, but then you just have to start and resolve a new attack later.  In short, i think reno1051 is right.

## 44 [Mestrahd on July 16, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45848-son-of-arnor-question/?do=findComment&comment=500471)

I'm still not sold on the idea that the combat phase wraps back around from Player 4 to Player 1 just because something got moved. I'm of the opinion that if an enemy missed his window of opportunity then too bad.
