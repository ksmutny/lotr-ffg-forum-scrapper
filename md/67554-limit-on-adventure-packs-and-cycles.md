This may be a question that has been brought up already but I was curious to know if there is a cut off to the adventure packs in the game? In other words, has FF said that there will only be 3 cycles of adventure packs with the stand alone expansions and that's it or is there no limit set for how big the game will get?

 

I only ask because I'm still pretty new at this game and only own: Core set, Hunt for Gollum, Conflict at the Carrock and the Kazhad Dum set. It's been difficult for me to try to catch up since I'm not made of money and can only get about 2 sets per month and new ones keep coming out. 

 

If there is no limit set, which is my suspicion, is there a set that would be good for me to pursue next or should I just keep going in order like I have been with the exception of the KD exp.?

theres no limit, and if you look at games such as cthulu and game of thrones you will see just how far they have come with packs and add ons. id recommend you just keep going the way it is, not that it matters all that much, but it seems the most logical way to do it to me

 Don't think there has been any limits set, not officially at least. But just take it in your own tempo :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] and I would recommend getting all the APs in the Mirkwood series first. Then KD expansion (which you had right?) and then the Dwerowdwelf series. But it all depends on how you go about this. If you like the stories go for the way I descried. If you just want a lot of strong cards you should use the cardgamedb.com site to se which cards in which pack and just buy those. I like the fist way best but that's entirely up to you :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] hope it helps a little

I hope there will be new packs for a looong time.

Greetings.

 

(PD: just posted because the thread seems working wrong, at least for me).
