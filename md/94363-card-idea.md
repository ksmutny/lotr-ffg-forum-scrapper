I was playing a game of HFG and came to a point in the middle of a round were I knew I would get a load of resources next round but really needed them immediately during the round i was on to play some card that would help drastically.  I came to think that it would be really cool and quite nice if there was such a card as this:

 

Gondorian Banker  Cost 3  1W/0A/1D/2H Lore. Gondor. Banker.

Action: Exhaust Gondorian Banker to add up 2 resources to one of your hero's resource pools.  During the next round the player does not collect X amount of resources to his heroes resource pools with X being the amount borrowed.

 

I know this card would probably have problems but this is the best I could come up with and I think the Idea would be really fun.  If you have Ideas on how it could be better feel free to share.

Maybe you could gain one resource for each card you discard, or for every two cards you discard

I had initially thought that selling cards would be Lore's primary way of generating more resources - as it struggles greatly with it. Borrowing money doesn't seem a bad idea either...

What do you think about this?

GONDORIAN SQUIRE Can't attack, defend or commit to a quest. Immune to player card effects.

GS may have any amount of weapon or armor attachments with "restricted" keyword.

Action: Choose an attachment attached to GS and attach it to any eligible character.

Action: Choose any attachment in play and attach it to GS.

I would change  Gondorian squire's actions to Action:Exhaust GS to...

And Gondorian banker costs 3 and borrows up to 2 resources, so you still have one less-but it's good idea, you just have to develope it a bit.

I really like the idea, and it kind of reminds me of some of the Netrunner banking-type cards.

Yeah well you could kinda say the same about Master of Lore.  It's supposed to be a safety/Insurance type thing for later rounds plus he quests for 1 and doesn't die on a Necromancers Reach type card.
