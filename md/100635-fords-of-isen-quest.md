# [Fords of Isen Quest](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/100635-fords-of-isen-quest/)

## 1 [Road Runner on March 6, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/100635-fords-of-isen-quest/?do=findComment&comment=1004083)

I have recently purchased Voice of Isengard. 

 

My other card sets are the Core Set and Over Hill and Under Hill so my card collection is still somewhat limited.

 

I have played the Fords of Isen quest and am beginning to believe that I don't have the card selection necessary to complete these quests. 

 

I haven't disregarded the possibility that I'm not a very good player.

 

Any advice?

 

Thanks!

-------

 

First try was very close, I had more than enough progress on stage 3 to win, but got smacked down by a last minute flood of enemies.

 

Second try was tense as well, I ended with 49 threat.   First round encounter deck reveal was Pillaging and Burning, and my threat skyrocketed immediately.  Then I had Gandalf in play and kept him around, so threat just kept climbing.  The Gimli-Beorn combination is fantastic for this quest, though, as together they can knock out most enemies in a single punch.  Beorn can defend without exhausting, just priceless.  Rohan Warhorse is a natural fit for Gimli (don't believe the hype, Dwarves love to ride) and with Unexpected Courage he can also quest.  Gimli shines in this quest, as he can soak up damage via stage 2's time counter effect and other encounter deck treachery or Forced effect nastiness. Throw a Citadel Plate on him to make him a powerhouse.  

 

You might drop Foe-hammer from your deck, I had it in mine but it was a dead card because I wanted to avoid penalties from the encounter deck, and was trying to keep the number of cards in my hand low.  Give it a try and let us know how it goes!

Thanks GrandSpleen.  I'm glad I'm not beating my head against a brick wall with no hope of breaking through. 

 

I've tried 3 times so far.  The first was a blind stab just to get a feel for the new cards and what the quest was about.  Have to admit before I even started, just looking at the enemies in the set had me wondering how I could deal with them.  Seemed like an army of almost Hill Trolls and Ungoliant Spawns. 

 

My last try got me to within 8 quest of winning and beginning to think my trio of Eomer, Dunhere, and Eowyn should be altered.  I will try a few more builds before I look close at your deck and see if I can get it done. 

 

I can only imagine the next two quests promise even more headaches for a limited card collection....

 

Take care!

I believe you can do it with only core set and VOI. Yes it will be hard but that is make it more cool.  DO it!!! and give us report.

Wasn't Beorn from Conflict at the Carrock, not Over Hill and Under hill?

grimbeorn is in that quest - as an objective ally.

 

but the beorn hero came out in the hobbit sagas.

You are not incorrect...

 

Beorn is present in the game since the Core set, as a tactics ally.

This quest is BS!.  Added Beorn as hero.  No luck.  Eomer not getting the job done, switched him out for Gimli.  Still early exits.  Finally I got this one in the bag.  9th round, 42 threat, 4 cards in hand.  Play Saurmann for doomed 3 to 45. No problem he will carry me over in the quest to win this thing finally.  Staging-Burning and Pillaging.  Draw a card, threat to 49, Old Hatreds attached to quest, 50.       !@#$% [!@#%24%25]^&*().   

 

Who came up with the ridiculous quest?  I should go back to digging ditches for recreation!

 

Yeah, should have left creepy old Sarumann in Orthanc.

 

Time for some hard liquor......

8th round success score 116 after about 10-15 failed attempts.  God I wonder how bad a headache I'll have after To Catch an Orc........

Try Eomer, Theoden and Eowyn. Use all these Noldor elves that need to discard cards to stay in play. They're gonna be the allstars in this cycle:

Gonna try them tonight hopefully.

I have a plan for a Rohan deck to start with, but the trick with the two moldor allies is a nice one
