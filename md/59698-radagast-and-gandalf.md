Can Radagast's resource(s) be used to summon Gandalf?   Radagast's card says "can be used to pay for creature cards"; and, the rulebook says "that [neutral cards] can be paid for from any heroes pool".  I'm starting to use Radagast more and more in my decks, and it would be very handy to have him help summon Gandalf.  I'm pretty sure, though, that he can' because Radagast is not a hero.   I just want to make sure I'm reading the rules right.

Radagast is not a Hero.

Gandalf is not a "Creature".

Both of those are reasons why Radagast cannot help pay for Gandalf.

 Something is only a creature if it has "creature" in it's trait.
