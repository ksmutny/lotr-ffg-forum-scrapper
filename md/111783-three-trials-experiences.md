Omg, in solo it is really hard. Like dol guldur nightmare solo.

 

 

After 10 times i finally have won.

 

With the monosphere leadership Aragorn · Imrahil · Sam

 

 

 

How about you?

Lost my first and won my next two. I think it's about a 5 as advertised.

In solo? Which deck? I dont believe it ^^.

 

Are you sure? Last round you must resolve 6 attacks from guardians (firsts three attacks by traveling, and the others by normal combat phase)...and you must know the cancel effects (in 6 times, you probably must repeat another immediate attack, sure!), how do you block this twister?

Believe it. My deck is set up to put 3 Unexpected Courages on Aragorn along with Stewart of Gondor, Gondorian Shield & Burning Brand. Meanwhile Boromir has a shield of his own, a Song of Wisdom and a Burning Brand. Arwen standing by to pump Aragorn if he needs it.

It's an attachment deck that uses multiple Masters of the Forge on the early turns to get these out. As long as I get to pick the order of my trials it's not a problem.

You can't win till hallowed circle is explored however so you have to travel at some point... It's also immune to player effects so can't be explored in the staging area

yes, i know, but Mndela said you have to face 6 attacks, I'm suggesting you don't.

 

Kill all the Guardians first, then travel, so it's Forced effect never triggers.

Very true, also a very good plan!!

It also has pretty low threat so wouldn't do too much damage staying in staging for a while

In solo, is hard to kill all enemies before travelling. And the most correct is to kill one or two at least the first round they are in play. If not, you will have to defend 6 times anyway.

i don't play solo, but i don't see why you can't just kill them first, then travel - it certainly seems like it would help you in this case.

In solo it is too hard to quest, defend three guardians attack, and kill one of them. Even if you reach to kill one, you can't keep alive more than 2 rounds.

The best way in solo is to travel (and block guardians 3 times) and return to defend the 3 times in combat phase. After, the next round make a good quest phase and try to explore the location to win the game.

## 14 [booored on July 27, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/111783-three-trials-experiences/?do=findComment&comment=1172007)

It isn't to hard, and you can kill them if you like. Remember if you have a leadership splash you do not even need to quest with "Ever Onward". Very underrated card but in quest where there is a lot to do at once, it cna make a huge difference. Though there are so many ways to quest AND fight in the same turn... .. .

## 15 [MyNeighbourTrololo on July 27, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/111783-three-trials-experiences/?do=findComment&comment=1172015)

Gondorian Shield Boromir can solve all your defending problems.

Yeah, good idea, Ever Onward ^^. I haven't never seen it in play, first time i notice it usefull.

i've played it twice two player and won both times.  Really the key was in both instances one player had a beefed up Elrohir which was really able to easily handle every attack by the guardians.  Really fun quest although love the different mechanics of the trials and obtaining the keys.  The second match we did have a player threat out mostly due to the first barrow being the one which raises your threat by the guardians threat level combined with the raven guardian who took a bit longer to kill as we had to get set up and he was the first one out.  Despite the two victories I can see this quest as being extremely challenging if your not bringing a hero such as Elrohir or Boromir to the table who can defend with impunity

In multiplayer is more easy than solo. Solo is a really challenge, like DolGuldur

## 19 [Tracker1 on July 28, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/111783-three-trials-experiences/?do=findComment&comment=1172375)

Just tried with Irdraen, Beravor and Glorfindel Spirit. Survived until the 3rd stage. i did not have enough power to take out the Guardians, and did not have enough readying deal with the after traveling six attacks. It was close, but things fell apart with the combined effect of time counters going off. I'm surprised I made it that far. Looks like tactics Boromir is going to be one of the answers to this. Interesting and I like it so far, but it's looking like there is going to be one main strategy for the solo player to be successful on this, but I'm going to continue to throw different decks at it before I call on the Captain of Gondor for help.

Oh yeah, very hard solo! It's a really nice challenge!

I've played it six times already and haven't won. I tend to try a few times with a deck before I give up though.

I got to one game where i was ONE WILLPOWER AWAY FROM WINNING! and then the second round of 3 guardians attacked and took me out. That was one of the most tense games I've ever played. Gondor deck probably did the best overall. I think that it's really a combat focused deck that will work but you do have to be able to get that key from the location on one stage... 

 

 

This is definitely getting up there with one of the best quests ever released for the game IMO, and I haven't even played it multiplayer yet!

## 21 [Tracker1 on July 28, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/111783-three-trials-experiences/?do=findComment&comment=1172504)

Just pulled off a win on my second try, took 16 rounds and was at 44 threat final score 184 minus victory points. Thought I was a goner, was at threat 49 when ancient mathom pulled 2 elrond counsels. Very close, sweatin bullets.

I used Idrean, Glorfindel spirit and Beregond. I only and 3 copies of arwen in the deck in the deck for allies. The rest was 0 and 1 cost cards except for 3 UC. My whole strategy was to pile up resources on Beregond with Blood of Gondor and Idrean with Gondorian Fire. i was able to have Idrean and Glorfindel take out 1 guardian per round before traveling to the final location. But even If i did have to face the dread 6 attacks, I had three feint in and a number of readying effects for Beregond. The main concern was location lock. I did not have a ton of willpower. And got lucky to draw Lay of Nimrodel for the final push and used Idrean's heap of resources to blast through the last location for the win.

i really have no Idea how consistent this deck will be, but I cant't believe it pulled it off. Im ready to try again with Strength of Will for a bit more location control. We'll see if it was a fluke or if I'm on to something.

I lost this afternoon using my superhero deck and randomly choosing the stages. This is a very good test for the solo player though there is a bit of a formula. Really want to see how the dwarves handle it.

## 23 [Tracker1 on July 28, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/111783-three-trials-experiences/?do=findComment&comment=1172552)

Okay, tried again and it was a location lock loss, but the following was another win.

For the win in the end Beregond defended all 6 attacks with 1 UC, 1 Miruvor, 1 White council ready, and 2 feint, and 1 hasty stroke prevented another attack. The following round Idraen quested for 16 with Lay of Nimrodel, she had 14 resources in her pool, and with glorfindel they had 19 willpower and just cleared the final location by 1 with with 6 threat in the staging area and 12 progress to put down. Unfortunately, we lost Arwen the round before. It took 15 rounds to complete again with a score of 181. Not sure this deck will be able to do better than that.

Cool quest. There is a bit of a code to crack like Bullroarer Took said. So far I have only done stage 2 with intuition, perseverance and strength sequence. Randomly selecting the sequence will add an even greater challenge I believe.

out of curiosity how many times have you guys been on the trial of intuition and perseverance (aka the two not required to actually kill the guardian) where you HAVE killed the guardian then the following turn reveal the treachery that puts an out of play guardian back in play? happened both games for me and was definitely one of those "you've got to be kidding me" moments.

 

I need to go back at it this week with some different decks since i feel like Elrohir/Elladan is the premier deck for this quest and try some other strategies for fun.  In so far as creativeness goes this has go to be near the top if not the pinnacle of FFG's quest design.

Very cool quest, probably my favorite since The Steward's Fear.  We played 2-player twice.  Played blind the first time and lost, shifted the decks around and won on the second try.  

 

Winning decks were Glorfindel(Sp)/Beorn/Beregond with heavy attachments and defense allies, paired with Aragorn(Lo)/Balin/Sam with global +willpower effects and a criminal amount of card draw and resource gain.  Trial of Strength first since we were so combat ready right out of the gate (Glorfindel with a Rivendell Blade, Beorn, Beregond with his shield and spear).  Trial of Perseverance after, then Intuition.  Had some good luck with Barrow+Guardian pairings (Stone Barrow + Boar's Guardian is the luckiest combination here).  

 

All the Guardians ended up engaged with my deck, the Beorn deck on stage 3.  Went ahead and suffered 5 attacks on the seventh round as soon as stage 3 was revealed (3 attacks from travel, minus one in the Combat phase due to Feint), then took out the Raven's Guardian in retaliation.  They wiped out all my allies and Beorn had 9 damage on him, but we very easily quested to victory on round 8.  Fun quest.

Try him with steward and shield as well as 1/2 dundedain warnings, elven mail and Arwens buff. Nothing gets through. Played the lonely mountain the other night and Elrohir defended every attack Smaug made in my playthrough and only ever took 1 damage.

It's happened in 3 of my 4 games, I was lucky to have test of will to stop it once. But the first time i saw the Treachery I was crushed and all sense of accomplishment for defeating the guardian in stage 1 intuition trial was sapped, just when I thought I could relax a bit I got to deal it again the trial was not over yet.

Well Guardians are indestructible in the trial of perserverance so if you do that trial after another stage and have a second guardian you  already beat in another trial in the victory display it would come back and you'd be facing two!

This scenario may be one of the best designed yet. I don't see any lope hole in it that makes easy and simplified, or anything that makes it so challenging that there is not much chance for success.

I've only played it solo now numerous times, and it's hard, period! Every time I have won it's taken between 14 to 16 rounds, and even when/ / if I make it that far things can go drastically wrong. Each card off the encounter deck, every shadow revealed can ruin well laid plans.

The developers did a great job! Thematically the trials are awesome and the quest design fits it perfectly with the story line. There are so many meaningful decisions to make, mixed with the randomness of the barrows locations and Guardians keeping things unpredictable, it all adds up to a very tense and fun experience where I feel like I'm battling tooth and nail to survive. It's such a satisfactory feeling to win that type of game.

I'm really getting into the story of the ring-maker cycle, and it's cool to feel like I'm actually playing out parts of the story. The scenarios and stories are fitting together perfectly. Really like the direction things are headed. It's definetly shaping up to be one of the best cycles yet.

After having five defeats, yesterday I managed to win the quest. I was always using Glorfidnel, Idraen and Beregond, but i finally came with the opinion that in the way I was playing, I should include Thrors Key on my deck (i kept loosing on third stage out of threat cause of the location that adds +1 on each forest on staging area). The first play I included it , I won. It took many round (23) mainly because on the stage 2 quest that has the key shuffled on the 10 last cards, it came to be the last card while I had to give two shadows. Thus I gave this as first shadow but had to reshuffle the whole discarded encounter deck in order to give the second. Then the key should be shuffled (as it has as a shadow) with the WHOLE encounter deck .... it took a while for it to appear again  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

That was the first time I have read this particular portmanteau.  Usually I see 'Spirfindel,' and for just a second I thought you were combining SPirit + LORe and coming up with a 5 threat hero who can heal for the cost of 1 resource.

Just finished the quest playing two-handed after 3 losses with solo decks. Took me about 10 turns and almost reached max threat, but Gandalf saved me once again. Decks were Beregond/Eowyn/Idraen and mono lore Bifur/Haldir/Faramir with a splash of tactics to turn Faramir to a secondary defender, which didn't pan out in play. Beregond was buffed with a shiny shield, x2 UC and x2 of the new green silvan meals that saved his life. I experimented with Gothlaf, Warden of Arnor and Haldir for the first time, and I found them all up to notch. Warden with Asfaloth seems like it would trivialise all those pesky 3 point locations.

Except for a buffed up Haldir, the decks lacked attacking power, so I had to defend 6 attacks in stage three. However, my questing power allowed me to finish the game next turn. Looking back, mono lore wasn't the best choice for this quest (so few enemies that traps are near useless) but I like rangers so there :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

Difficult, unpredictable and fun. Two thubs up!

I am really curious how you guys managed to beat it solo, it seems really hard if you get unlucky with barrows/guardians...Getting the 5 attack one ruins all but the best opening hands. If someone could post a deck I'd really appreciate it.

This is the deck I used.

There are 2 versions of it one with allies and the 2nd without.

I found Beregond to be essential for the scenario if your not going to try and use chump blockers to win You can only hope he gets Gondorian Shield opening hand or that you don't get the 5 attack Guardian. Ways to ready him are also essential. In the last stage I'll just take 1 Guardian at a time before traveling to the last location. Overall this is an awesome scenario, and I always felt like I was right on the edge of losing right up to the very last encounter card drawn.

Thanks, I'll give it a try tomorrow. I've never played a deck with so few allies before, so it will be very interesting indeed.

I like the quest too. Pretty hard but not unfairly so (*cough* into Ithilien *cough*). My lore deck clocked at 49 threat before the timely intervention of Gandalf and won next turn. :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

By the way what do you think of Idraen so far? I personally like her a lot and she combos well with Glori. Her trigger also activates almost every turn in multiplayer games.

My thoughts on here changed dramatically. At first I did not like her, but then i figured out how to play her in deck without allies, which is something i always wanted to do. So, i enjoyed that very much, although I do feel she is kind of stuck to Glorfindel and have had a hard time putting her into decks without him.

Here is the thread when she was first released, cool to read about peoples reactions and it also follows the evolution of my thoughts on her.

There is also a a lot of discussion at Tales from the Cards on her if your interested.

Tracker - Do you think Idraen and Glory can pair up for a decent Spirit secrecy deck?  I put together a list that might perform okay against the easier quests, but would just get blown apart by the harder challenges such as Three Trials.

Don't remember my deck exactly. but the cards I most used where more or less (I forgett some)

 

Heroes Glorfindel, Idraen, Beregond

 

Allies: Arwen (3), Stargazer (2) (so I could bring the attachments I need more quickly), Defender of Rammas (3), Vassal of the Windlord (3), Gandalf (3) 

 

Attachments: Citadel Plate (2), Dagger of the westernesse (3) (very usefull), Gondorian shield (3), Rivendell Blade (2), Light of Valinor (3), Thrors Key (3), Unexpected Courage (1) 

 

Events : Feint (2), Elronds Council (3), Test of will (2), Hasty Stroke (2), Lay 0f Nimrodel (2), Out of sight (2) (for the third stage where you should have enough resources, Glorfindel had some 15 resources when finished), Behind strong walls (3)

 

 

The attempt I won the enemies and borrows came the worst combination possible, but I had a good first hand draw (thought not LoV) and started building my deck carefully in order not to lose anything while playing, like allies discarded by time effects on enemy cards etc

My deck was Hirluin the Fair, Theodred and Grima. 

 

Just a generic outlands set + the tools to make it out as fast as humanly possible.

> Tracker - Do you think Idraen and Glory can pair up for a decent Spirit secrecy deck? I put together a list that might perform okay against the easier quests, but would just get blown apart by the harder challenges such as Three Trials.

It's possible. Idraen would probably have to turn into the main defender. Arwen would have to get out soon, and Blood of numenor would help her later.

But here are the main problems I see without having another dedicated defender.

This is not the problem. The nice thing about her working with Glory is that they can both quest and l if there is location leaving play she and will ready, and Glory usually will have LoV. Then they can attack for 6. It's nice to get a readying effect on Idraen incase a location does not leave play.

Now, without a 3rd hero as defender. You can't rely on Idraen readying after questing to defend so at least 1 UC is going to be needed to make sure she can defend. This would normally be the only insurance she would need to attack and quest every round, but now she will need an additional UC or other readying card to insure she will then attack. If you get stuck engaged with 2 enemies it will be tough to get out of, since glory has no way to boost his attack above 3, so he is relying on idraen or other allies to finish of most enemies.

In the early game LoV will be even more critical since it may not be wise to quest with Idraen in case she has to defend a low threat enemy. If she does not quest and glory does not have LoV yet he will need to exhaust to quest, and if you get engaged your probably done for. Since, she will be defending, and if he can not attack, it's only going to get worse next round.

Also, idraen can be turned into a solid defender, but it will take a bit of time. Blood of Numenor will help, but it takes resources to function, which will put more strain on Glory to pay for most things, so a few Resourceful on him will be necessary early.

So, you could probably make it through some of the easier quests, but I foresee a bumpy ride with a deck feeling like it's missing a wheel, and in my mind that missing wheel is a strong tactics defender.

But give it a try I'd like to hear how it goes. I'm just speculating here. They might work better then I think in actual game play

On another note Glorfindel And Haldir have some real potential for 2 hero secrecy, but song of battle and weapon attachments are critical early on.

My conclusions are much the same as yours. I think it needs to have a decent number of chump blockers for when the enemies begin to engage. A Watchful Peace may also be very useful. I'll give it a try against Tharbad. If it can't do well there then it won't stand a chance against the rest of Isengard.

You could use out of sight in such a deck with the secrecy it has too. But it needs time to build a deck that can absorb damage, make damage and quest too, using spirit only. It should be very interesting to try it for the fun of it. Also against the shadow could be used to defend with glorfindel

I put together a list and ran off a couple of games against Passage through Mirkwood. Lost the first horribly as the first three cards were Beastmaster, Beastmaster, Hummerhorns followed by a bunch of treacheries including two Caught in a Web. I had a pair of Power of Orthanc in the deck but didn't see them and without any locations ...

The second game was more representative I think, but I did get Beorn's Path for 3B which made it much easier. Certainly not a tier 1 deck, but not as bad as I had feared.
