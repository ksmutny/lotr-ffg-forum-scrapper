I am new to the game.

Could someone confirm whether it is legitimate to have two copies of the same location card in the staging area  or one in the staging area and one as the current location ?

I kind of hoping that it isn't as travelling to the same location twice seems a bit boring.

as many locations as come out can stay in- thats how you end up getting over ran…..

so yes you have to often travel to the same locations twice
