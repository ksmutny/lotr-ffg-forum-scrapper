I'm not sure I get FFG strategy here. Is LOTR LCG such a big hit that every re-prints run out of stock worldwide in a few months? If so why not print more? Don't they want to sell games?

Or is it that they do really low numbers of re-prints? If so why not print more? Don't they want to sell games?

Yes, but they have so many lines that itâ€™s hard to keep up. There are other, higher profile games they produce that make more money and are more popular (x-wing, Arkham, etc.).

Plus, I think Asmodee is in charge of reprints and stocking.

I can only assume that they have more games to print than can be physically printed with their current setup. They have been unable to meet demand across many of their different products for a while now.

It's super frustrating.
