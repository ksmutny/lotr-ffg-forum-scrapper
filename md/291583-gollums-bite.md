Hi guys,

Card's text:

When Revealed: Deal 4 damage to a hero controlled by the player guarding Gollum. That player must choose a new player to guard Gollum, if able.

If Gollum's bite comes up during the encounter phaseÂ and all of my heroes are committed to a quest and they have 4 or less hit points do I need to subtract the willpower points associated to the eliminated hero?

Regards,

The total willpower is calculated at the end of the phase, when you resolve the quest. So yes, if a character die during the encounter phase, he doesn't contribute to questing anymore.

Hi guys,

Regarding to the shadow effect:

Deal 2 damage to a hero controlled by the player guarding Gollum.

Is thisÂ damage applied to Gollum?

It is said "to a hero", gollum is not a hero. The player guarding gollum chose one of his heroes and deal 2 damage to him, that's all.

Thanks,

But since the heroes can't have the option to defend that damage, Should Gollum receive the damage by the rule on the card?

"Damage from undefended attacks against you must be dealt to Gollum."

That is not damage from an undefended attack, but damage from a shadow effect. Even if that shadow card was dealt to an enemy whose attack you took undefended the damage from the shadow effect still applies to an hero, while the normal damage from the undefended attack is dealt to Gollum

Does it apply for hummerhorns force effect too?, the damage is dealt to an hero.

Forced: After Hummerhorns engages you, deal 5 damage to a single hero you control.

Undefended attack only refers to standard attack made by enemies for which you don't declare a defender (because there is no character available, or because you don't want to defend).

All others sources of damage are just "direct damage". You can't defend them (so you never reduce them by the amount of defense of the character), and they are not considered as undefended attack.

Shadow effect of Gollum's bite and forced effect of hummerhorns are both direct damage effects, so you apply them to the target (a single hero in these cases), without taking in account his defense (so yes, forced effect of hummerhorns deal 5 damage to a hero and kill him if he doesn't have an attachment that boost his hit points)

Or you don't cancel some of the damage.
