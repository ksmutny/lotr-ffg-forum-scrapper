Can I save a card from being discarded at the end of the round? It is this not possible as the end of the round implies that there is not an action window left.

You don’t need to worry about having an action window. Since Silver Harp is a response, not an action, you can trigger it, interrupting the “end of the round” whenever it’s condition (discarding a card) is met.
