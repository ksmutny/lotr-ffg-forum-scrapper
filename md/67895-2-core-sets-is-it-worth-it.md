# [2 Core Sets? Is it worth it?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/67895-2-core-sets-is-it-worth-it/)

So, thanks to some helpful people on this forum I was able to get the rest of the Mirkwood cycle and a couple of Darrowdwelf (sp?) cylce ap's for cheap. Now I can actually build some decks with some clout. However, in looking at the deck lists online a lot of them seem to require two Core sets. I have a hard time seeing the value in this since it seems like so many cards will go to waste (all the encounter cards plus some of the core cards I'm already not using). I realize it would be nice to have more Gandalf's and another Unexpected Courage, among others, wouldn't be too bad but it this really worth it?

 

I welcome any and all opinions.

Since there is no tournament enviroment now, and personally I cannot see when there will be one in the future, I'll just proxy those handfuls of cards that I need two or three copies where one core set would not provide; instead of purchasing two or three copies of core set and throw away a large part of them, which I think it is a waste of paper.

ive played since core release with only 1 set- not had any problems and ive made some winning decks. id recommend just keep going through the packs, theres easiliy enoough out now for some great decks to be made and its just going to keep getting better

it is useful if you have the spare money, but it is by no means a must have

I'm also playing with only one core set which is enough to build good decks. If you're not able to win at all, a second core set will certainly help. It's making the game a lot easier, but for me it takes away the fun of the challenge.

Yes Leptokurt is right. I buy 2 core set in the case of tournaments but……there is no tournaments anyway. FFG just lie to us from the begin.

So really there is no point to buy second set cose is also make game more easy. Stay with one, is more fun and challenge.

 I agree, I've tried proxying extra core set cards before and found things to be a little too easy at times.  Stick with the one, much betterhappy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]

Goes from challenging to easy with two core sets, but the game is designed to allow for three of each card in it's deckbuilding method?  This seems like piss-poor design (not to mention ugly in it's implementation).  I too was wondering about a second core set, after, to my horror, I dived in thinking they had eradicated all the silly philosophies that were at work from the previous LCGs.  Alas, no.  Fantastic cards I discover in the Core Set, only to realize there was ONE COPY available.  Proxying is gross to me, but so is spending $80 just to feel like I can play with what should be there.  That single, player-screwing maneuver has put what was otherwise an enjoyable game on the fence for me.  That there is a lot of complaining on the forums about this or that feature not being implemented should not surprise anyone at this point.  They got the manufacturing down.   It's the rest they have to work on.  

 

Sorry for the rant.  To it's credit, I actually am thinking of ways to get a hold of another core set.  It makes a difference.  I just don't know if I can justify it.  (I did that with Warhammer, but no one was playing the game, and back then you had to buy 3 packs to get all the cards.  It died).

all depends on the factors - how much are you into tolkien? this game will only keep growing, its still in its youth, so i think (and i havnt done this due to lack of money) that the 2nd core set is worth the money, but probably not the 3rd. The wierd 1 copy of cards in the core set was the only mistake ffg have really made with this game, i think they have done superbly since then.

 I am inclined to agree thusfar.

I think 2 cores is really what any serious player needs for most cases and if you have to have a 3rd card for those rare ones you can just proxie.. but 2 cores will give you a nice card pool for not only your self but cover others as well. It will also give you some spares for making custom quests and proxies for those power cards like Tomb, as well as adding storage and the exta threat wheels for 3/4 player

It really depends on what you want to get out of the game. The game is fun to play regardless, so it is just up to you as to what you want from your game experience.. As this is not competitive nothing is driving you to get the 2nd or 3rd copy.You can make more powerful decks with 3, and you will not get that ocd collecters urge hasseling you when you look at your collection, but will having 3 of each card enhance your experience?

Well IMO yes. I own 3 sets and just for the record I zero interest in Tolkin lore as I find all that magic realms of elves and fairies to be mind numbingly boooring.. BUT the game is really good witch is why I play. I like having 3 sets as I have no limits to my deck building.. I can do what ever I like. I can look at any deck online witch others have made and build it myself, I am nvr going.. bah that is made with 2xCore or w/e…  I also like being able to host game nights and be able to make decks for 4 people with ease. So with more copies of core you can have more fun, as in you are better set for multiplayer, you have threat wheels all that stuff.

This is really the main point… There is no rules here, the game plays fine with one set.. you just have less deck building options, and for some that is to restrictive, while others do not care.. and is that simple.

If there WAS a rule it would be Buy 1xCore and then start playing… if you like it buy more!

It is worth noting that the game is dropping in popularity and many are going to be moving to Netrunner and / or Star Wars. If you check BGG a lot and EBAY you can find cheap copies of core constantly coming on sale as people dump it from their collections. I picked up my 3rd copy of core as Khaz came out for 15 bucks US.. you can get good cheap deals when you look, and a full copy of core for 15 bucks.. well .. why not get it?

At the moment for example there is about 6 sets on sale that are a good price, some even have expantions. You can get a 2nd copy of core + ALL of mirkwood for 80 bucks on ebay right now… There is another with all expantions release so far for 130… pretty good.

This was pretty much the reason I picked up the 2nd core set.  While I DID want a second copy of some of the "power" cards, it was mostly so that I could have a large pool to create an extra deck or two for friends who don't own the game to play with casually… the extra storage and threat counters were just a bonus…

I purchased a second Core Set because at work (when I get to play the most), there might be three of us, and that meant there weren't enough Gandalfs and threat counters.  Also, there was only one copy of Unexpected Courage and Celebrian's Stone which was frustrating. I waited to see if FFG would release a pack of cards to give the players 3 of every card, but that didn't happen.

 

While I don't have three of each card (I just cannot justify purchasing a third core set at this time. I gave my three year old son the extra cards so he'd stop messing with mine.), I find 2 is a good number for them. Also, we were running out of resource tokens at one point (especially during our three person games).  Granted, the game was a lot tougher with just one Core Set.

 

In the end, it's up to you and your budget what you want/can do.  I've enjoyed having the 2nd, but most likely will not purchase a third.
