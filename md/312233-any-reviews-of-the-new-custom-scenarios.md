Has anyone reviewed the two new Moria themed custom scenarios yet?

I have the two Mirkwood themed ones, and while I really like the idea of them (essentially deck building for the encounter deck), in practice I found them underwhelming. (Though I'm playing solo, so probably not getting the most out of them.)

Did they make any improvements to the new ones?

I've never got into them myself as I just play solo and am not interested in competitive play, but there are various review threads on the reddit forum. Here's one (which to be fair appears oddly mixed):

I don't have a review for you, but I'll say that I like them better than the Mirkwood ones. My gut reaction is that they can be harder (but I still beat my own scenario on the first try, hmm).
