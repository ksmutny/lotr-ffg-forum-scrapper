 Hi.

I have played this scenario many times but I think this is the first time I got this ending. So suddenly I'm in doubt how "soon" the step 3 is done. Maybe I thought too much about it or it's the fact that I tried a solo game playing dou deck. Anyway, this is the case:

The quest is is Passage through Mirkwood. I know, I know, lame quest :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] but it's been a while since I last played it so I just needed an easy quest to get back into the game. Anyhoo, it's the last step of the quest called Don't leave the path and I'm to defeat the Ungoliant's Spawn in order to win the game. I just defeated it and now there's only one enemy left. But how is it again: is the game over as soon as the criterias of the quest is fulfilled? Like, the moment Ungoliant's Spawn leaves play OR do I need to defeat the rest of the enemies/locations first? As all my heroes are exhausted I matters a lot if it's the first or the latter since I have either won the game OR am going to loos next round.

Thanks in advance :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

You win as soon as you meet requirements of the last stage i.e. you do not have to clear staging area and/or kill engaged enemies.

From the posts here I see that some people do not find this sudden death win mechanic thematic and like to clear everything but as far as rules go see above.

 Thanks for a quick answer. Hm, hadn't thought about the thematic aspect. Dang, might as well try and se what happens if I go for clearing the staging area.

Again, thanks.

The World Wildlife Found will take you to court for killing the whole population of that protected and very rare kind of spider?

No fear there…I got my ass served to me by one The Necromansers Reach and a laughing Chieftan Ufthak followed by yet two more Necromancers Reach…and they where not dealt as shadowcards. 1, 2, 3, 4 and…dead! XD
