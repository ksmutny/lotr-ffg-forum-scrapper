Hi - what does this mean;-

"each of the four 30 card starter decks in this core set can be played out of the box......"

I don't remember seeing cards grouped into 30 card collections when I opened the box originally - I just have 120 cards on a big pack

IIRC each of the four spheres have 30 cards if you split the Gandalf cards 1 to each set.Â

Yep. 29 blue/spirit, 29 green/lore, 29 purple/leadership, 29 red/tactics, +1 Gandalf (neutral) for each sphere.
