I favor Lore above all because of cheap squishy allies, card draw, and healing. I would argue that Lore is the best "stand alone" sphere.

Tactics, why? Because I'm just that kind of person.

Yes. Tactics!

Spirit. Because they rule.

 

Best stand alone sphere is Leadershit though.

I like all of the spheres in their own way, but to me Lore is the most interesting. It does card drawing, scrying and healing better than any other sphere. It also has some great unique allies (Gléowine, Haldir of Lórien, Gildor Inglorion and Anborn to name a few) and attachments (Thror's Map, Ranger Spikes, Ranger Bow and Protector of Lórien). Most of all, I like the tricks that Lore allows which change the game. Asfaloth, Denethor, Elf-stone, Ithilien Tracker and A Burning Brand all have the potential to fundamentally alter the way the game is played. To sum it up, I feel like Lore often gives you more decisions, and particularly more interesting decisions, than the other spheres.

Lore would definitely come in close second, mainly because I love using rangers and traps. But I think I enjoy bashing skulls together with someone like Beorn more. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Spheres are very well created in this game. Love them. However, I still feel like Tactics is far, far behind. For some time, during the AtS cycle, I was torn but when the Fellowship saga came, or the VoI, I was sure again. Tactics is far, far behind, with Lore also lacking strides, I would say. Tactics is still very weak solo but I would not say they are best as a supportive deck, either. In a majority of quests it is more beneficial just to build up your numbers than use the subtle finesse of direct damage or feint moves. Then, Lore is also weak solo but good in coop. Spirit I think has the most powerful cards overall but Leadership can handle it both solo and coop very well.

 

Now, I know I was not answering the thread question. I am often with the underdogs, I really want to see great cards for the spheres I find less capable, Lore and Tactics. Lore is probably closest to my heart with all the nature themes, and especially with the Ents coming!

I'm joining the lore parade here.

Picked lore mainly because green is my color when I started out clueless really.

Turned out to be correct, still like the sphere best for it's mechanics.

Spirit comes second, I like spirit too.

Hello there,

 

I do prefer the leadership sphere for the charismatics heroes !! And ressources management.

 

I think, as said before, that tactic really lack something to make it more intersting. They should have some heroes able to quest correctly in order to have balanced mono tactics deck.

 

We have done some 4 players play with mono pshere deck and the tactic one was really boring. The player was just waiting the fighting phase, killing what he could and that it.

I am in love with lore :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] Because I like green... no no haha, I do like green, but I love the type of specialisation lore has - it is more subtle than the questing power of spirit, or the fighting power of tactics. I think leadership is 2nd favourite for the same reason, but leadership is more obviously powerful than lore...however I think if played correctly, lore can be the most powerful of them all ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

 

Nice thread

It depends on if you play solo or multiplayer. For solo then clearly (expect for a few quests) mono tactics will struggle.

Best mono decks are lore and leadership for solo. This is mainly by each one has a way with hirulin and elrond to get different sphere allies into play. Mono spirit solo is hard (but better then tactics) mainly be you lack attack power.

For multiplayer though I have always felt that the way the gsme was meant to be played was 4 mono sphere decks with 4 players. It's the easiest deck building as well so you don't spend hours fine tuning a monster deck. In that case, I like being the tactics guy and smashing

Leadership is my favorite. I primarily play solo and 7theye has already mentioned leadership is a good solo sphere.  It can do everything well (not great but well)  Also with just the nature of being titled "leadership" it has some of the most renown 

heroes to play with as well including Aragorn, Thorin Oakenshield, Boromir, and Hirluin the Fair! (jk on that last one)

Tactics! It always seems like when a quest has been hanging in the balance or things are looking bad, it's been a Tactics hero who saved the day. Plus a lot of my favorite characters seem to find their home there.

Very difficult to choose between lore and spirit. I go for Lore! I like mechanic of lore and also logo is cool

My heart says Spirit, my brain is torn between Spirit and Lore.  Both are very capable in my opinion of playing solo or multiplayer in a mono deck.  I actually prefer Leadership for multiplayer but they really need to add some lower cost Leadership heroes.  Tactics at least has Merry :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

Tactics is the deck I most often play monosphere.

But I prefer trait themed decks to sphere themed ones because they're generally more interesting.

Lore for all the fun mechanics and characters although Spirit is my go to since it can handle questing so well but it gets boring. Tactics is my second favorite since its so fun killing stuff and I still have yet to love Leadership.

## 20 [soullos on May 20, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/106387-your-favorite-sphere-and-why/?do=findComment&comment=1091123)

Tactics. I just to beat things to a pulp.

Tactics first, then leadership and lore equal and spirit I really don't care for. Don't get me wrong there are fantastic spirit cards (ones that I use as well) its just my least favorite and to me the least interesting.

## 22 [Pharmboys2013 on May 21, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/106387-your-favorite-sphere-and-why/?do=findComment&comment=1092435)

I feel very similarly in regards to spirit.  I get it, its a good sphere but also kind of vanilla and straight forward.  Even though tactics is singularly focused on what it does combat is funner and generally involves more decision making than say, exhausting during the quest phase

Precisely! I couldn't have said it better

for me it is lore. I just feel this is the sphere where most extraordinary things can happen, lots of card manipulation, draw, gives you a feeling of being in control and having lots of options. Also, my favourite powerful allies are lore: Haldir, Gildor, Angborn.

Spirit I also like a lot. I think it complements lore the best. And the lore-spirit combination fits best to the (from lack of a better term) values of the free peoples of Middle-earth. I mean that it often is not the brute force (tactics) or vast resources (leadership) but the knowledge, wits and determination (to me lore & spirit) that give heroes the advantage over the Shadow. But it is purely subjective. No offence to tactic and leadership fans ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

My top three favorite spheres are:

 

1.  Lore.

2.  Lore.

3.  Lore.

 

Oh, and Spirit is a close second because it's an essential add to any deck.  Unexpected Courage, Test of Will--you really can't do without these.  

 

Leadership gets a special mention, of course--why?  Because SNEAK ATTACK--GANDALF!

 

That said, I just put together a Spirit-Leadership deck (Éowyn, Théodred, and Dúnhere) and I'm enjoying it a lot, mainly because it has the resource pull that I'm always missing in my Lore decks.  Of course, playing it, I find I'm seriously lacking in card draw, so it's a tradeoff.  lol.

Lore.. no question.

Lore has the most powerful effect in card games, card draw / deck manipulation. Any deck, of ANY sphere is smoother with a lore splash. Lore improves any deck it is in.

With the addition of the traps and ranger subset they are now even able to handle large attack needs on their own. The last remaining weakness. They quest, have great support, and most importantly even beyond card draw is they are the sphere for encounter deck control. Oh yeah, they also have the heals.

Control decks rule.

If there was a sphere I would call a Generalist sphere, then it is lore.. dose a bit of everything. Great for solo players.

For myself, I tend to play Leadership. I enjoyed the Gandalf-Sneak Attack combo. That brought me deeper into the sphere. It wasn't until I realized that resource management cards like the Steward of Gondor allowed for mighty, powerful armies. When I play, I usually find myself amassing a large group of allies while the other player I usually play with is struggling to just pay for a Citadel Plate. They're also the best at being ready to drop Gandalf in the Core Set un-Sneak style.

 

Leadership seems like it is the best of most worlds. I admit it lacks when it comes to threat management, but what sphere is perfect?

I like all the Spheres, but play Spirit the most, mainly because there are a ton of little decisions to be made all the time.
