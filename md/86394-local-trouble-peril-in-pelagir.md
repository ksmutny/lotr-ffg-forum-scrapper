Hi,

I just stumbled over "Local Trouble" hitting me twice:

What happens after the first card was attached to the hero with the highest threat and you draw "Local Trouble" again? Do you discard it, or attach it to the hero with the second highest threat?

Thank you for helping!

hello

heres the text

 

"When Revealed: Attach this card to the hero with the highest threat cost without a copy of Local Trouble attached. (Counts as a condition attachment with the text: "When attached hero exhausts, readies, or triggers an ability, raise its controller's threat by 1.")

 

so here it would go to the next highest hero

So you'd better get rid of it.

Thank you for your quick answer rich!
