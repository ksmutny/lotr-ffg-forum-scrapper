In Escape from Dol Guldur, what happens if an Objective card is drawn as a shadow card in combat?

I am not aware of any errata saying otherwise (as with the objectives in "we must away ere break of day") so they should just be discarded as any other shadow card.

Don´t loose them :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

Well, that's the problem becoz you need all 3 objective cards to complete the scenario, and if they're just disacrded, you have to go thru the whole shadow deck, shuffle them in and and wait longer to redraw them.

That's not the only scenario where things could go this bad.

The bottom line is that Dungeon Jailor is your enemy.  Don't let him take away your precious objectives.

Not entirely true...

 

You need all 3 objectives to PASS from stage 2 to stage 3.

 

On stage 3 you can loose the objectives because you only need to remove Nazgul of Dol Guldur from play and put 7 progress on the quest...

 

That can give you some time to prepare to fight the Nazgul or remove him from play...

That's why I prefer to defeat the Nazgul during stage 2, then claim the two remaining objectives (usually Shadow Key and Dungeon Torch) during the Planning phase in the round after I have defeated the Nazgul (assuming I have 15 progress on stage 2 by that point), so that I can get to stage 3 and complete stage 3 in the same round. That strategy also reduces the risk that I will have a prolonged battle with the Nazgul (+orc guards, + whoever I am engaged with or whoever is revealed by the encounter deck) lasting more than one round in stage 3, which could result in a failed quest if your threat climbs through the roof because of the Dungeon Torch.

You could also use additional restricted attachments to loose these objectives. That how I often get rid of these attachments especially the key.

True, but… I just prefer to power quest through stage 3 without having to fight at all. Much safer, in my opinion.  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]
