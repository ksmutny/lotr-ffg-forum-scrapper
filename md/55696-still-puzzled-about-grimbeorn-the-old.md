I understand that Grimbeorn the Old remains with the first player of the round in which an 8th resource token is placed on him.  However, I'm still puzzled by the effect of the card.  It states that whenever Grimbeorn the Old has "8 or more" tokens on him, then his effect comes into play.  Why does it say "8 or more?"  If it only costs 8 resource tokens to pay for him, why would there be more?  What benefit is there to paying more tokens after he already joins a player?  Is it a way of switching control of Grimbeorn?  For example, say one player controls Grimbeorn and decides to use Grimbeorn's action to place a 9th resource token on him.  Does Grimbeorn then switch control to another player who happens to be first during that particular round?  I'm just trying to figure out why the phrase "or more" is used.

Covering their bases just in case through some unintended effect he winds up with more somehow?

Maybe they have a (Leadership?) card in the pipeline that manipulates resource tokens on non-hero cards (Grimbeorn, Radagast, Gollum)?

yea sounds like wording that will allow them to make up cards latter that affect cards from long before they were even dreamed up.. this is one of the reason loosish wording is unsed in these types of games...

maybe, it's just for poeple unable to count....

 

"look, now there are nine tokens on it, what shall we do now? Let's call for a new FAQ for this situation!!!"
