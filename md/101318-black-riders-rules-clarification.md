Hi everybody!

I'd like some light to be shed upon a couple of questions that raised playing the Flight to the Ford scenario:

 

1) A Nazul equipped with Pale Blade is immune to Gondorian Spearman / Spear of the Citadel effect?

2) Can Bill Ferny be engaged by Knight of Minas Tirith?

3) If I'm questing with a sole hero, can I remove that character from the quest to pay Unwanted Attention cost?

 

Thank you very much in advance!

1) yes

2) yes, pretty much needed or a son of arnor or an hammer stroke. This guy means trouble.

3) no, 2 or nothing.
