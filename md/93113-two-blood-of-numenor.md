Can you attach 2 copies of Blood of Numenor and use both in the same phase?

If your hero has 5 resources, can you pay 2 resources (1 by each copy) to use both and get 6 defense points (3+3)? Even, only paying 1 resource :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]  both attachments are 'activated'?

Yes you can trigger both.  You do have to pay 1 resource per card, though.  And actually, it would 4+3 for 7 defense points.  There was a ruling about this awhile back: you count the # of resources at the time you trigger the Action.  Any subsequent change to resources doesn't matter.  So, for example, if all of your resources are discarded via a shadow effect like on Bitter Wind:

 you still retain the original effect.  So in your example it would be:

5 resources

Trigger first action, pay 1 resources and get +4 defense

Trigger second action, pay 1 resources and get +3 defense.

And that original ruling was here [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/80004-blood-of-numenor/?hl=%2Bblood+%2Bnumenor].
