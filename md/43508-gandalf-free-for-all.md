We can use him with any hero?Cause i dont see a sphere icon on his card.

## 2 [YGrams on March 8, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/43508-gandalf-free-for-all/?do=findComment&comment=435188)

As he is an ally, you need to pay x amount of resources to put him into play. As he does not have a sphere, this means you can use resources from any heroes, from any sphere, to pay for him. For example, you could pay 1 from Aragorn, 2 from Denethor and 2 from Gimli, even though they are of different spheres (assuming Gandalf's cost is 5; I have a feeling it is, but it probably isn't, knowing my memory).

I see.Thanks a lot for your reply.

Gandalf needs 6 resources to put him in play lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif].

If I remember correctly, they changed Gandalf's cost from 6 in the early preview to 5 in the finished game.

Except, you have the old Gandalf card when they still had the symbols instead of the text saying istari or wizard. Make sure to update it once we get the final card. Thanks for your work!

## 9 [BeardFan on March 10, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/43508-gandalf-free-for-all/?do=findComment&comment=435785)

 Yeah, that's the old card. The response is also changed on the new card, I think it was not kill an enemy but inflict 4 damage now. And note that on the final cards, the willpower symbol is the top symbol now on the left side.

So Gandalf now plays with heroes with the willpower sphere?And about the response you still must discard Gandalf at the end of the turn?

## 11 [BeardFan on March 11, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/43508-gandalf-free-for-all/?do=findComment&comment=436428)

No, you misunderstood me. Gandalf is a neutral card. The sphere you mean is spirit. Willpower is on of the 3 attributes of each character. What I meant is that on the prototype cards the first symbol was Attack, then Defense, then Willpower. On the final cards it's first Willpower, then Attack, then Defense.

Everything is possible I suppose, but I don't really think so. Gandalf would have to be too powerful to be a faithful representation of the character we know from the novels. You'd lose the game before even starting it since your threat rating would be too high gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]

We have the rules now.Only one copy of Gandalf each player can have in his deck.

## 16 [Toqtamish on March 14, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/43508-gandalf-free-for-all/?do=findComment&comment=438116)

No, 3 per deck.

"Additionally, no more than three copies of any card, by
title, can be included in a player’s deck. Within these
guidelines any combination of allies, attachments, and
events can be used in the player deck."

I think i saw in the rules that Gandalf is the only free for all card in the core set and you can have only one copy of him in your deck.I ll check again.

## 18 [servant of the secret fire on March 14, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/43508-gandalf-free-for-all/?do=findComment&comment=438130)

Each starter deck should also include one copy of the neutral ally card,Gandalf(card 73).

Maybe this rule is only for starter decks and you can have 3 copys of Gandalf in a customize deck?Please explain that to me cause you allready know that my English sucks sad.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sad.gif].

The quote you found is simply informing players that each deck will come with one Gandalf card already in it. But that doesn't mean you can't add more copies when you create your own custom decks. When building a deck, you can have up to three Gandalfs (or any other card).

Works like that in all the LCG's, they tell you how to build the decks. But when you build your own you can have up to 3 of any card. Even unique cards.

You can have three copies of Gandalf in your deck but since it's a unique card, you can only have one copy of the card in play in the game at any given moment..

We know, confusion Servant had was from two different paragraphs in the rulebook, one of which says each deck should have one Gandalf in it. For the 30 card starter decks.

Yea also Beardfan said that his respons has changed.You dont discard a minion but you deal 4 wounds.

Beardfan old Gandalf's text says tha you must discard Gandalf at the end of the turn.This counts for the new Gandalf card or they change that too?

## 28 [BeardFan on March 16, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/43508-gandalf-free-for-all/?do=findComment&comment=438764)

Yes, the new Gandalf also has to be discarded at the end of turn. Unfortunately I can't remember the exact responses on Gandalf's card. It were 3 alternative  responses. I think one was to lower threat of one player, one was to inflict damage, on was to draw cards.

Yes, but there's also an info that You can built decks to max 50 cards for tournaments and stuff like that. So it looks like if You want to start playing fast out of the box You can use those 30 card sphere decks and after that You can custimise Your deck and make it a 30-50 cards. That's good, and now i know I need more sleeves. gran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif]

Can't wait for the first time, when I open the box and start playing.

FFG Fan, as I read it, it was minimum 50 card decks for regulation sized decks, rather than the 30-50 size decks. You're going to need even MORE sleeves than you thought =)

Most card games its best to stick to the minimum size for draw consistency. The bigger the deck, the harder to get the cards you want/need.

I know that, but page 27 of the rule book says "A tournament deck must contain a minimum of 50 cards." Not maximum.

Yea i think this is correct.For tournaments 50 cards is the minimum and not the maximum.

Minimum size decks are indeed better except if you have a way to draw a lot of cards per round (example:Moria orcs from LOTR tcg) then you can use a biger deck and use more cards that can help you for a more easy win.

Well, the best way to use Gandalf is with Sneak Attack of course.  And I assume you can put him back in hand before he discards himself.  A little combo-riffic, but pretty powerful considering his abilities.  Hopefully there is something that lets you put back the Sneak Attack. 

## 36 [DrNate on March 25, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/43508-gandalf-free-for-all/?do=findComment&comment=444008)

Wow. Gandalf plus Sneak Attack! What a combo. It looks like he does go back into hand at the end of the Phase, while Gandalf is discarded at the end of the turn. Now all I need to figure out is which phase to play him to get maximum effect: Quest, Encounter, Combat...

## 37 [Bohemond2 on March 25, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/43508-gandalf-free-for-all/?do=findComment&comment=444011)

The Gandalf we have seen (the 6 point one, rather than the 5 point one in the actual finished set), discards at the end of the round.  Sneak attack returns to play at the end of the phase.  So, no worries about him discarding himself. 

Throwing down a 4/4/4 is always going to be wonderful, but we may need to see some calirfication on tules terminology to tell if you the other benefits of playing Gandalf when you sneak attack.

And, of course, we won't really be able to tell until we see the new card (unless I missed something.  Does anyone have an image of the 5 cost Gandolf?)

## 38 [DrNate on March 27, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/43508-gandalf-free-for-all/?do=findComment&comment=444768)

 So, for people who play other LCGs, how often does FFG issue bans or errata on cards? 

Just wondering if the Gandalf Sneak Attack might get done away with shortly after the game comes out...

## 39 [Toqtamish on March 27, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/43508-gandalf-free-for-all/?do=findComment&comment=444771)

For GoT they do it every few months when they release a new FAQ. I forsee Gandalf/Sneak Attack possibly having this done. I am sure they will keep an eye on that particular combo.

## 40 [micheni on March 28, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/43508-gandalf-free-for-all/?do=findComment&comment=444879)

the point that is needed to be more clear is the    "put in play"    and     "play from hand"  phrases on the cards  . if these phrases have the same meaning its a great combo . if not  ( and from my experience they are different ) then bye bye combo.

## 41 [faith_star83 on March 28, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/43508-gandalf-free-for-all/?do=findComment&comment=444886)

True, that is a very good point. I didn't realize this with all the excitement. In mtg for sure it is not the same to play a card from and to put a card into play. The name of the card does say Sneak Attack, so it might really just be handy to have a quick Defender / Attacker for the phase, although we might not enjoy any other effects like Gandalf's when using this method.

For CoC it's about twice a year, I think. Either after the conclusion of an AP cycle or before the (world?) championships.

The current FAQ is version 1.3. We're going to see 1.4 before the next championship. There are currently three complete APs available for the game, the fourth is about half-complete.

I realy wanted Gandalf as a hero and the opportunity have him allways in the entire game but i can see now that Gandalf in this game acts exactly as he acts in the books.

Gandalf wasn't allways there for everybody.The free peoples must raise their strenght and fase shadow with what they have but wen defeate is near if you  look at east Gandalf is there to save the daylengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif] (Helms Deep,Weathertop.Gondor,Mount Doom saves Frodo and Sam with the Eangles wen Frodo and Sam were sure that this was their end).

All assumptions about Sneak+Gandalf combo are based on preview version of Gandalf (with hat icon in right bottom corner).
Final Gandalf could have different wording.

Well considering designers are same as AGoT its pretty easy to figure that out. Put into play is when card is put into play via a card effect or special ability of some kind. Play from hand would be when playing a card thru normal process, IE spending resources to play an ally etc.

## 46 [9thimmortal on March 28, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/43508-gandalf-free-for-all/?do=findComment&comment=445137)

It would be a major change if you couldn't use him w/ Sneak Attack.  That was the main combo they demo'd at GenCon last year.  It isn't that broken unless you can consistently get it from discard to hand (rather than deck where you have to draw it again).  Pretty powerful though, being able to discard a huge enemy for 1 resource and two cards (plus Gandalf can play a round). 

But, anything is possible - they changed the ruling on 'put into play' rules in aGoT at one point. 

## 47 [servant of the secret fire on March 28, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/43508-gandalf-free-for-all/?do=findComment&comment=445165)

I dont think that they will change sneak/Gandalf combo.Watch introduction video again and you can see that Hill Troll is not a unique card.2 Trolls in staging area and only one player with 30 threat means 2 trolls on one player.With 6A and 4D i dont think any player can overcome this and his defeat is a sure think.

As Beardfan told in his post Gandalf's response has changed and he is does not remove a minion from the game now but he deals 4 wounds(Hill Troll has 9 life).So having Gandalf/sneak attack combo is not an i win situation but a chance to overcome such a threat.

## 48 [9thimmortal on March 28, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/43508-gandalf-free-for-all/?do=findComment&comment=445213)

That is certainly balanced.  Four wounds is still strong, but not even close to discarding an enemy strong.  Good change. 

## 49 [Toqtamish on March 28, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/43508-gandalf-free-for-all/?do=findComment&comment=445227)

The fix to Gandalf was likely to decrease this combo's power and to avoid a banning. One of the good things about the long development of this game.

Hill Troll is not unique - it doesn't mean that you will have 3 copies of it in core set.

Right now everything is speculation.  gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]

 

 

Hill Troll is not in the core set but in the second adventure pack.I am 99.9% sure that an adventure pack based on Trolls will have over 1 copy of Troll but even if i am wrong you can see in the same video the monster beside the Troll and its allmost as hard as the Hill Troll and if Carrock location is active your doom is near.

Hill Troll was just an example but other minions will be as hard as this Troll and Gandalf is there to make thinks a little more easierlengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif].

I believe you will be forced to face a Hill Troll in the Journey Down The Anduin scenario in the core set. It also says 'If another Hill Troll is not already in play', or similar, suggesting it won't be limited to one copy. But of course that could just be covering the bases for custom scenario play...

I dont think that they will change sneak/Gandalf combo.Watch introduction video again and you can see that Hill Troll is not a unique card.2 Trolls in staging area and only one player with 30 threat means 2 trolls on one player.With 6A and 4D i dont think any player can overcome this and his defeat is a sure think.

No, you are incorrect. Hill Troll IS in the core set. There will be a different Troll type in the Carrock pack but we won't know what it is likely till closer to its release in June. You can see the Hill Troll in the videos. There is at least two in the box as you can see two in the Introduction part of the videos.

Also, if you need Gandalf, or, even worse, Gandalf + Sneak Attack, to deal with the big nasties, than the game has serious balance issues.  You don't want success to hing on whether or not someone draws the ubercard that everyone has in their deck.

I doubt that you NEED Gandalf to do well in the game, it just happens to be a card combo that we are aware of, therefore it gets discussed. I have no doubt that there are many combos of significant power that have yet to be discovered. So if Leadership isn't to your liking, there should be a nice combo for your favorite sphere(s). I'm personally hoping for a nice Tactics/Spirit one (as I refer to it, red-blue)

Could we avoid using Magic the gathering terms. Every card game seems to get labeled using MTG terms and just once would like to avoid that. This game is still in its infancy which gives us the unique chance to make up our own terms for use. Lets be unique and buck the trend.

I never said that Gandalf will be the only way to win tha game.I said that Gandalf will be there to make thinks a little more easier as he is a neutral ally (the only neutral ally in the core set) and every sphere can use him.

As for the core set from what i have seen so far i am almost sure that a deck with Gandalf will have an advance for an easier win than  deck a without Gandalf.

Nice, one. I had similar thoughts. But I think it's almost impossible to avoid some Magic terms to enter the LOTR LCG since some the nature of both games is the same: They're card-games. And thus there will be similarities.

It would be a shame though if ffgs effort to have the nice flavour provided by the sphere's names reduced to simple color-naming. But I do have my doubts that everyone will use the actual names of the spheres, since colors are more easily remembered sad.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sad.gif]

That explains all lol.And i thought that Toqtamish has lost his mind and his comments has no meaning(i have never played magic and i couldnt understand what Toqtamish wanted to say)partido_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/partido_risa.gif].

If this make you feel better Toqtamish at Lord tcg we allways use the name of the icon of each card and not the color of the icon.I hope the same will happen with this game.

The fix to Gandalf was likely to decrease this combo's power and to avoid a banning.



Yeah, Gandalf being banned right from the start would be ... not exactly ideal demonio.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/demonio.gif]
