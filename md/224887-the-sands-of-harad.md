"Meanwhile, your desperate journeys may also lead to desperate alliances, and you'll find a pair of heroes who make each other stronger, as well as a cluster of new player cards that require paired Traits to trigger, but that then offer tremendous rewards. You'll also find new allies for each sphere of influence and a game-changing side quest that allows you to ignore resource matching on the first ally you play each turn."

New versions of Gimli and Legolas? Or new versions of Elrohir and Elladan? Or new heroes entirely?!

Ironic that that card will make elf & dwarf friendships common instead of Unlikely.

Probably a new version of at least one of Gimli and Legolas, since neither can currently play Unlikely Friendship.  It would make sense to just do both, they are long overdue.

I also like that they go to great lengths to explain that the "game-changing" sidequest isn't all that significant in practice.

I do love that the dunedain ally works with all existing sidequests. Would be rad to get him as a result of clearing Send for Aid ready to defend without exhausting straight away.

Um, it's because I'm probably bad, but that quest... well, how to put it - after a couple of rounds it will be pointless, and I don't think you would be able even consistenlty draw it, not to mention clearing it.

 

Aside from it, great news, everyone! Wee!

I am so happy they are finally putting more support in for decks that focus on diverse traits. A core theme to LotR is different peoples banding together, so it's nice to see new player cards explicitly supporting that. More sidequest support is great too!

 

I'm guessing Temperature will be a recurring thing like sailing is in the current cycle. Maybe we will get a big ol thermometer card to track it.

I see that, FFG decided to come back to side quests. They are absent in the last cycle, and in The Saga Expansions. The idea of side quests is very good, and I am happy that Angmar Awakened wasn't a last cycle in which you can complete side quest. 

This new side quest seems to be very powerful. 

I agree that in this expansion we recieve new Gimli and Legolas.

I like Dunedain and side quests, so getting Vigilant Dunadan and a new side quest seems to be a promising start to this expansion!

It seems that Dunedain will be connected to side quests as a consistent design theme, which is cool. The new side quest is really only viable in multiplayer, but if you design a team around it, it could be good. Unlikely friendship will unlikely see play--a card and a resource is so low impact it will always be the first card cut when you are making your deck. The game just has too many good cards.

I don't agree. A cycling card that gives you a resource is extremely good in my book. Wealth of Gondor and Gaining Strength are seeing play, Unlikely Friendship is like them on steroids.

I like the side quest a lot. You could make a mono-leadership Dunedain deck, for example, and still include your Northern Trackers. As for finding it consistently...

I disagree about Unlikely Friendship.  If you have a Silvan and Dwarf hero and are running leadership, there is no reason to not play it.  You get a resource and it replaces itself.  There is no downside.

No mention of any Istari character, Doomed keyword, or Artifact makes me sad and worried. Because this would have been, like, THE time to revisit those.

 

Seriously, Caleb and Matt, what's a man gotta do to get a couple Istari heroes, a few magic rings and a couple Seeing-Stones? That's literally all I ask for!

That Vigilant Dunadan is crazy good once you get a side-quest out of the way. I was just thinking, imagine exhausting ally Arwen for Tale of Tinúviel and targeting him. He would defend everything on the table for 5, and still be able to attack for 5 afterwards. Takes a lot of cards to set up, but if your side-quest is Gather Information you could pull your Arwen or Tale of Tinúviel.

Given the time period our main storyline takes place, I'm guessing this has something to do with stopping or spying on Sauron's growing influence in the South and East.

I am super excited for this one. More desert locations? More Mumakil? And that temperature stat has got to be Celsius. 40F would be fairly pleasant in Harad.

I don't think they will be allowed to mention the blue wizards directly, but we might see something on a quest card that gives us Help Unlooked For etc.

 

It sounds like we will might be using threat dials in a new way on some quests.  I wonder if we will be tracking temps in Celsius or Fahrenheit?

Wandering around Harad for the next cycle makes me wonder where the following cycle will end up.  If we head roughly northeast during the cycle, rather than returning to Gondor, that would put us in position to move north into Rhun, or even into Mordor itself from the south or east.  My guess would be Rhun.

as i understand, blue wizards cant be displayed in lotr game due to copyright, but it could be released, not directly with the names (for example pallando), but yes as indirectly, for instance, 'legendary wizard' or 'wizard of the east' etc. of course, it would be ally

The more I think about it, the more I convince myself that it has to be Legolas and Gimli. It would be really lame to build a Legolas + Gimli deck but be forced to include a Leadership hero to be able to play Unlikely Friendship.

The two extra wizards are attested to in the text and also Appendix B of LOTR.  Name and color are not given.  Here is the Appendix B passage:

---

When maybe a thousand years had passed, and the first shadow had fallen on Greenwood the Great, the Istari or Wizards appeared in Middle-earth.  It was afterwards said that they came out of the Far West and were messengers sent to contest the power of Sauron, and to unite all those who had the will to resist him; but they were forbidden to match his power, or to seek to dominate Elves or Men by force and fear.

 

They came therefore in the shape of Men, though they were never young and aged only slowly, and they had many powers of mind and hand.  They revealed their true names to few, but used such names as were given to them.  The two highest of this order (of whom it is said there were five) were called by the Eldar Curunir, 'the Man of Skill', and Mithrandir, 'the Grey Pilgrim', but by Men in the North Saruman and Gandalf.  Curunir journeyed often into the East, but dwelt at last in Isengard.  Mithrandir was closest in friendship with the Eldar, and wandered mostly in the West, and never made for himself any lasting abode.

---

Gandalf himself had five names, not counting his actual name, and likely would've had six if he'd spent time going East.  The Unfinished Tales give their names as Allatar and Pallando, but from Appendix B we know they would NOT have gone by those names in Middle Earth, and their hero/ally cards should no more have those names than Gandalf should be labelled 'Olorin'.

 

Per the Tolkien wiki, a letter gives an alternate set of names Morinehtar and Romestamo (Darkness-slayer and East-helper).  FFG doesn't have the rights to those, but those are Elvish names, and not likely to be what they were known as among men.  They're likely the equivalent of Mithrandir and Curunir.  Gandalf, Saruman, and Radagast are the names used in the North, if the other two ever spent enough time in the North to acquire names, they would not be those names either, and the names they acquired among men in the East (and were likely most commonly known by) would not be these.

 

Bottom line is that the names the two missing wizards *actually were best known by* are likely not known and FFG has a legitimate right to invent a name and use both wizards, who are attested to in TLOTR -- and the two names that *we* best know the wizards by are the very names they would NOT be known by in Middle earth.  That doesn't mean FFG will ever create them (the fanbase would certainly expect Allatar & Pallando with blue robes), but they would be within their copyright rights and thematic fit to do so.

I personaly am respectfully against this type of design. I mean, you're totally right, it's totally possible for the developers to make the Blue Wizards with different names, and that is a logical reason why, but the thing is that, for good or ill, Alatar and Pallando just are their most iconic names and the ones that resonate with people the most. It comes down to the very nature of tcg's and lcg's of just trying to represent every, or most elements of its world with a card. It really is what it shares with, say, baseball cards (which are not a thing in my country). Having the Blue WIzards with different names or some other legal acrobatics would be incredibly awkward to me, much with what happened to Lotr tcg, in which they had "follower" card, essentially ally attachments, named Alatar and Pallando, but the images showed the moths Gandalf used in the movies to summon the eagles. I mean, it's just bad either way to me.

I think your sentiment is likely in the majority, which is why I don't expect to see the wizards in the game unless they somehow got the rights to all Tolkien's works (not at all likely in Christopher Tolkien's lifetime).  Though we do have the advantage in this game of not being bound to any images in the movie, thankfully, so if they ever made the blue wizards they would certainly look like wizards with blue robes.

 

At the same time, I can't help be sad that their presence is precluded not really by copyright, but rather by fan attachment to names that they weren't actually known by.  The game could really use more Istari, and not just a hero Radagast.  What would be coolest is if they could get the rights to use Morinehtar and Romestamo, because then it would both be actual Tolkien names and also a thematic fit.

 

I also think there's no good thematic reason to join the two wizards at the hip, just because they share a color.  The LOTR wiki suggests the etymology has Pallando connected with foresight and Alatar with trees(!).  Would I like an Istari with scrying powers and an Istari that boosts Ents?  Yes, yes I would.  Though if Alatar was the Radagast of plants, as the wiki suggests, its odd that Treebeard calls Gandalf "the only wizard that cares about trees."  Then again, Treebeard might not have seen him in a few thousand years and assumes him dead.  Maybe he's hanging out with the Entwives.

 

I can dream that the cycle taking us into the East runs into the other two wizards.  And finds the hidden location of the entwives, only to be sworn to secrecy so that the annoying menfolk won't show up....

If the blue wizards were added to the game they should be enemies of our forces.

 

Radagast was explicitly the odd one out in that he didn't raise armies in conflict with the other Maiar in Middle Earth, and there is no reason to believe even he wouldn't eventually be pushed to wage war with the victor.

Unlikely Friendship is good enough that, leaving theme aside, it's worth looking at Bifur as possibly the best Lore hero for a tri-sphere Silvan deck.

## 42 [Slothgodfather on July 13, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/224887-the-sands-of-harad/?do=findComment&comment=2308706)

When Silvans first game out Bifur was already the best Lore hero for a tri-sphere deck and I haven't seen anything to change my mind since then.  Depending on deck makeup, I typically Steward on to spirit hero and ues O'Lorien for the leadership Silvans.  But yes, it isn't not exactly thematic in terms of pure traits.

Saruman is the only Istari who is known (canon) to have raised armies against "our forces", and we both have him as an ally and also spent a cycle serving him.  And given the blue wizards went to Sauron-influenced territory, if they had raised armies they'd have no one to fight but Sauron's servants.  There's no reason to think they "should" be enemies of our forces.

 

Let's look at the textual evidence.  First let's look at a letter written in 1958 (letter 211 to Rhonda Beare, answering the question of what colours the two other wizards had.  Tolkien then wrote:

---

I have not named the colours, because I do not know them.  I doubt if they had distinctive colours.  Distinction was only required in the case of the three who remained in the relatively small area of the North-west.  (On the names see Q5.)  I really do not know anything clearly about the other two -- since they do not concern the history of the N.W.  I think they went as emissaries to distant regions, East and South, far out of Numenorean range: missionaries to 'enemy-occupied' lands, as it were.  What success they had I do not know; but I fear that they failed, as Saruman did, though doubtless in different ways; and I suspect they were founders or beginners of secret cults and 'magic' traditions that outlasted the fall of Sauron.

---

As you can see, this is far removed from the conception of Allatar and Pallando, joined-at-the-hip wizards who went East to fail.  Tolkien doesn't know the colors, doesn't know the names, doubts they have colours, has them possibly going different directions, thinks they failed but doesn't know it, but if they failed thinks they "doubtless" failed in different ways than Saruman.

 

In Unfinished Tales is printed an account of the Istari that mentions them, and "was written, as it appears, in 1954", so previous to the above-quoted letter.

---

Of this Order the number is unknown; but of those that came to the North of Middle-earth, where there was most hope...the chiefs were five.  The first to come was one of noble mien and bearing, with raven hair, and a fair voice, and he was clad in white; bearing, with raven hair, and a fair voice, and he was clad in white; great skill he had in works of hand and he was regarded by well-night all, even by the Eldar, as the head of the Order.  Others there were also: two clad in sea-blue, and one in earthenr brown; and last came one who seemed the least, less tall than the others, and in looks more aged, grey-heared and grey-clad, and leaning on a staff....

 

Of the Blue little was known in the West, and they had no names save Ithryn Luin 'the Blue Wizards'; for they passed into the East with Curunir, but they never returned, and whether they remained in the East, pursuing there the purposes for which they were sent; or perished, or as some hold were ensnared by Sauron and became his servants, is not now known.  But none of these chances were impossible to be....

---

A separate passage written in the margin of the 1954 story adds that of all the Istari "one only remained faithful" and explains about Radagast focusing on the beasts.  Obviously it's not necessary to become an enemy to the free peoples to become unfaithful to the errand.

 

Christopher Tolkien also records in Unfinished Tales about an undated sketch of a narrative of a council held for selection of the Istari, where Alatar was sent by Orome, and Alatar took Pallando as a friend.  I would guess that this is later than the 1958 letter, but it is more consistent with the 1954 essay than the 1958 letter, so it could well be earlier.

 

The Unfinished Tales is much better known and read than The Letters of JRR Tolkien, which explains why the account there has dominated the conception of these two wizards.  However, according to the Tolkien wikis, in the last year of Tolkien's life he revisted these two wizards again (reference to Last Writings in "The Peoples of Middle-earth", which I don't own.)  This gives the names I had above, retcons their arrival to the second age with Glorfiendel, and is emphatic that they were on the side of the free peoples.  Their interference helped the Last Alliance succeed, and although they failed to find Sauron's hiding place after his defeat, they managed to cause lasting weakness and dissension that ultimately was critical to success at the end of the Third Age, as East and South contained many, many more people than those Southrons and Easterlings that Sauron was able to bring to fight against the free peoples.

 

In short, I don't think the blue wizards "should" be enemies instead of allies or heroes.  I think it also would be defensible to encounter them in our journeys East or South, and not to use the names they were known by in Valinor.  And I think it would be incredibly cool if that happened.  But I don't expect it.

Sauron and Gandalf are both Maiar that raise armies and vie for dominance over Middle Earth. Saruman is not unique in the books.

As I read it, Elf-friend on a unique Dwarf hero would fulfill the requirement (as long as you also have a 2nd Dwarf hero around).  Right?  Or were you just saying you're happy that you have to actually have 2 different characters? (as in, the Dwarf cannot be friends with himself)

Well, I really had to think twice what Tactomir means. Is it so hard to write Tactics Boromir or even T-Boromir, haha?

Anyway, I totally agree. Before Gondorian Shield (and later Captain of Gondor), Blade Mastery was my number 1 combo with Tactics Boromir (then referred to just Boromir). In those times and quests, it usually did the trick.

Yes, indeed, I too had been playing Bifur with Celeborn and Galadriel before I went with another Silvan (of which Argalad might be a good fit in a month time or so). But Unlikely Friendship really fits perfectly into the Silvan deck with Bifur.

Hi, I see I'm late. Anyway, what I wanted to say: I've got mixed feelings about this.

By one hand, Cool! Exploring Harad and fighting in the streets (and keep losing progress), and sitting in the desert while the temperature goes up and you can't ready by numerous quest effects, and new trait mechanics, and side-quests=AWESOOOOOOOOME!

By another hand, another uncharted territory cycle? And those Were-Worms are nasty but weird...

P.S.: I've invented 2 side quests here.

1-Find Shadow

6

The sand begins to burn and it will be soon impossible to keep going.

Forced:At the end of the round, increase the Temperature by 2.

Response: After Find Shadow is defeated, reduce the Temperature by 4.

2-Surrounded!

4

The guards are everywhere. You must seek to confront them if you want to accomplish your goal.

Doomed 3. Surge.

Forced:At the end of the Staging step, each player must either search the encounter deck and discard pile for an enemy and reveal it, or remove 3 progress from each Quest Card in play.

The 'Free Peoples' is a loose, catch-all term in the books that doesn't include subjugated or maginalised cultures like the Dunlending Hillmen and Wose people, both of whom have legitimate grievances against the Rohirrhim who stole and/or encroached on their lands. It doesn't include the men of the east and south who Gondor warred with even through the long years of Sauron's absence (and after his demise). The War of the Ring is a more complicated affair than simply Evil trying to destroy Good.

 

 

Instead of breeding orcs or gathering non-Free Men to his side, Gandalf makes himself a presence in the two most powerful courts in the western lands, with a very cunning plan to put some random Ranger on the throne of Gondor (despite being a cool guy, Aragorn's claim is not that strong). Not only that, he had Faramir the "wizard's pupil" around as a backup! Ignoring any questions of morality, the aims of Gandalf and Saruman are fundamentally the same. They seek power, because their rivals seek power, which must be matched. It is the nature of their kind.

 

The blue wizards went into the east. In all likelihood based on the text of the Lord of the Rings (as a rule I don't care what an author intended to write, only what they actually wrote), they gathered to themselves forces by whatever methods they found appropriate, came to war with Sauron (and almost inevitably each other), and were probably destroyed or driven into ruin. The numbers of Men from those lands that Sauron is able to muster against Gondor and Dale suggests there is no significant resistance there.

 

Alternatively they went the way of Radagast and stopped caring entirely. But that would be boring.

> Sauron and Gandalf are both Maiar that raise armies and vie for dominance over Middle Earth. Saruman is not unique in the books.

Sauron is neither an Istari nor an emissary from the West and is not relevant to the Istari at all.  Gandalf's entire army-raising career consists of getting relief forces to Helm's Deep in time to save the day -- the Huorns and Rohirrim in question did not serve or answer to Gandalf and only in the case of the Rohirrim did Gandalf take an active part in gathering them.  Gandalf had no permanent power base of any kind, and turned down the Ring vehemently because he feared the power increase that came with it.  He's a spectacularly poor example of an invented general rule that Maiar will raise armies and vie for dominance.

 

Further there's two other (likely) Maiar appearing within the pages of the text.  Durin's Bane seems to have put no effort into raising armies and vying for dominance, his very existence in Moria is not known.  Tom Bombadil is likely Maia, and is less likely to raise an army and seek dominance over Middle Earth than literally every other sentient creature in it.

 

Saruman's behavior is unique among the three Istari in the book, and even though Tolkien thought the other two wizards probably failed (at least earlier in his life, later he changed his mind dramatically), he thought they "undoubtedly" failed in a different manner to Saruman.

Christopher Tolkien has pointed out (and rightfully so, in my opinion) that considering Radagast was sent by Yavanna, specifically, it's entirely possible that he simply had some other mission specifically to care for animals and plants.  To others who were more focused on opposing Sauron this may have seemed a failure (satisfying J.R.R.'s own writings on the subject of the wizards), while still allowing Radagast to have had some degree of success in serving the Valar (can you imagine Yavanna thinking Radagast a failure because he cared too much about flora and fauna?!)

 

As for the Blues in the East, I notice that maps show a LOT of land East of Mordor!  Rhun itself appears at least as big as Gondor, and there are more lands further out!  It seems to me perfectly plausible that the population could be high enough for there to be some small, rebellious factions and STILL have enough troops to send to Sauron (just think how many troops would have been sent without those factions!)  In one of his writings, Tolkien mentioned the Blues possibly having founded "magic cults", so I imagine a much smaller organization than Saruman's great armies.  Maybe we could encounter enemies like "Sorcerous Apprentice" or something, alluding to the Blues without actually naming them.

The Istari as a small group of assembled Maiar. They are not unique beings. Sauron is maiar. 

 

Durin's Bane clearly commands the orcs of Moria in some fashion.

 

 

Gandalf's lack of a "permanent power base" is irrelevant. The way in which he assembles his armies and allies is different to Saruman and Sauron, but he assembles them none the less. He has significant history of "advising" (or meddling) in the courts of Rohan and Gondor, and a place at Elrond's right hand. The return of the king is long-planned, with the heirs of Arnor kept safe and various legends spread in Minas Tirith ("the hands of the king are hands of a healer"... in that he knows basic elven remedies. Elladan and Elrohir help in the Houses of Healing only after dark, once Aragorn's public displays have been witnessed).

 

 

Even Peter Jackson grasped that the actions of Gandalf are not entirely benevolent (though his opposition to much worse beings makes them usually appear so). He is sent to stop Sauron, and works tirelessly to that end. 

 

 

 

He turns down the Ring because he knows it is a trap, and would drive his will to terrible places. 

 

Put it this way, if Gandalf's aim was to not raise armies and crush his enemies, he did a spectacularly bad job of it.

Possibly, but bear in mind that Aragorn and Eomer subjugate all those lands with relative and brutal ease following the destruction of Sauron. If they are populous enough that they could fight the War of the Ring as only one front, that sort of thing shouldn't be possible.

If you confine yourself to the text of the Lord of the Rings (even including the appendices), you can't say that the blue wizards went into the East, nor even that they failed.  All that information is found only in writings outside the text, which you are apparently classifying as "what an author intended to write" instead of "what they actually wrote", despite the fact that the author did actually wrote it.  And the *most recent* writings on the subject of the two missing wizards by Tolkien indicated that they did not fail -- and also says their success is in reducing the number of men from those lands who marched against the West.  While Southrons and Easterlings were in large supply, they did not have enough men to conquer either Gondor or Dale.  Considering that on the map we have Rhun is much larger than Gondor and unbounded to the East, while Near Harad alone is of comparable size to Gondor and is known to extend far enough into the south to make the stars strange, there's no reason from the text to suppose Tolkien's late writings in this regard cannot be incorrect.

 

The Wose had a legitimate complaint against the Rohirrim, but appeared to have voluntarily withdrawn to Druadan rather than being dispossessed by Rohirrim -- they had no clue where the Pukel men were from.  In the event the Wose aligned themselves with the Free Peoples and rendered valuable service.

 

The Dunlending have more longstanding complaints against Rohan, and in the reign of Aldor the Old he "drove out or subdued the last of the Dunlendish people that lingered East of Isen."  Folcwine is credited with "reconquered the west-march (between Adorn and Isen) that Dunlendings had occupied", the implication being that the Rohirrim had occupied it before.  In the war with Saruman, the Dunlendings came from west of the Isen, had not lived on Rohan's lands for at least 100 years, and from their false beliefs about how Rohirrim treated their enemies, it's clear that generation had no experience with the behavior of Rohan's warriors.

 

Before we get too misty-eyed about the poor Dunlendings forced off their land by the land-hungry Rohirrim, it's important to remember that Rohan was given their land not by right of conquest or colonization, but by grant from Gondor, the previous owner of the lands.  They were granted the land between Anduin and Isen (this would not include the west-march, but the appendices give no indication when this might have been originally conquered, nor by whom).  Gondor specifically granted it because it had been largely depopulated.  "The people of that region had become few since the Plague, and most of those that remained had been slaughtered by the savage Easterlings."  The Dunlending center seemed to be (naturally enough) Dunland, and if their ancestral home was actual Rohan, it would be Gondor doing the dispossessing.  But Gondor's original borders included Dunland as well, making the Dunlendings subjects in either location, and there is no textual support for Gondor forcibly dispossessing either people.  Now in the canon of our game, the Dunlendings have been victimized by the free peoples, but that is FFG's addition, not something from the text itself.  In the text the wild men were amazed at the mercy of victorious Rohan and apparently were happy to take an oath preventing future bad behavior.

 

What about the men of the south and east warring with Gondor even in Sauron's absence or destruction?  Sauron's "absence" did not amount to inactivity, and the implication in the appendices is that the malice of Sauron was behind the attacks from East, South, and also North.  As it says in Appendix A, "It was in the reign of Araphant in the North and of Ondoher son of Calimehtar in the South that the two kingdoms again took counsel together after long silence and estrangement.  For at last they perceived that some single power and will was directing the assault from many quarters upon the survivors of Numenor."  It also says that the invasion of the wainriders was "Stirred up, as was afterwards seen, by the emissaries of Sauron."

 

Gondor did expand both south and east, so that at its peak it extend to the sea of Rhun in the east and to Umbar in the south.  The wars with the east seem all to have been initiated by Easterling attacks, while the expansion south was driven by the ancient feud with the Black Numenoreans of Umbar.

 

What about Gandalf's cunning plan to put Aragorn on the throne of Gondor, despite his questionable (descendant from an already-rejected claimant) claim?  Doesn't that show that he sought power, even though in the event Aragorn only reached the throne of Gondor *after* Gandalf's great labor of toppling Sauron had been accomplished?  For starters, we'd have to show that it was Gandalf's cunning plan, that he actually took steps to accomplish the cunning plan, and that he would derive substantial power from it being accomplished.  Trouble is, it was never Gandalf's plan in the first place.  It was Elrond's plan.  After Arwen had chosen Aragorn, Elrond made clear to his future son-in-law that "she shall not be the bride of any Man less than the King of both Gondor and Arnor."  For his part, Aragorn seems to have had no intention of actually becoming king prior to the fall of Sauron.  After gaining great acclaim and influence as Thorongil, he left town rather than claim the throne from a steward who loved him very much, and even after displaying his standard he was loath to even enter the city.  For his part, Gandalf aided Aragorn's plan chiefly by working hard at the overthrow-of-Sauron thing, while using Aragorn to accomplish dangerous and thankless tasks with no direct connection to obtaining royalty.

 

What about hanging about the two most powerful courts (presumably Rohan and Gondor)?  The text makes clear that in both places he only appeared in time of trouble, was frequently unappreciated, and certainly doesn't seem to have spent any effort in flattering the powers that be.  Cultivating Faramir, that "wizard's pupil" as a backup plan to Aragorn's kingship also fails on textual grounds -- in Faramir's account, "I first saw [Gandalf] when I was a child, and he has been twice or thrice since then."  Faramir is a huge fan and calls him, accurately, "a great mover of the deeds that are done in our time" and says "I learned a little of him, when he would teach (and that was seldom)."  So a maximum of four contacts and only grudging instruction?  That's a miserable excuse for a power-seizing plan involving a man who was not in line to be the next Steward anyway.  Faramir is around 36 at the time, so Gandalf is showing up at the most powerful court in middle earth about once per decade.  A slim reed indeed to rest claims that Gandalf is just seeking power in a different way than Saruman, let alone to claim on that limited sample that it is "the nature of their kind"!

 

Since both Tolkien's early writings and later writings about the blue wizards are extra-canonical, you are free to prefer the earlier writings and even interpret it along your conception of how Maiar inevitably behave, except for Radagast.  However, I cannot adopt your view of Maiar and reconcile it with the text of the LOTR, and I find Tolkien's latest conception of the wizards to be consistent with the text of LOTR, more definite than his early writings considering their fate, more interesting, and more likely to produce amazing content for this game.  I think it's a shame that the wider propagation of his earlier writings on the wizards will likely preclude that from happening.  As always, YMMV.

The Istari are Maiar, but they definitely seem uniquely equipped for their mission.  They seem to not just take forms of Men, but to actually be tied to their bodies in ways distinct from the other Maiar.

 

Durin's Bane commands the orcs of Moria, but it seems to be in more of a "you're the toughest guy around so we defer to you" kind of way, as opposed to a calculated plan to increase power.  From what I've read, it appears that the balrogs don't really have much ambition or plans of their own.  Without Morgoth to command them, they pretty much just stay where they are (Durin's Bane doesn't seem to have pursued the dwarves after they left Moria, nor does he appear to have ever really tried venturing outside its halls).

Alternately, Aragorn and Eomer only have to suppress hostile realms, not fight a war to turn all Easterlings and Haradrim everywhere into slaves.  Here is the relevant passage:

 

"...Eomer took again the Oath of Eorl.  Often he fulfilled it.  For though Sauron had passed, the hatreds and evils that he bred had not died, and the King of the West had many enemies to subdue before the White Tree could grow in peace.  And wherever King Elessar went to war King Eomer went with him; and beyond the Sea of Rhun and on the far fields of the South the thunder of the cavalry of the Mark was heared, and the White Horse upon Green flew in many winds until Eomer grew old."

 

The repeated massive Easterling attacks into Gondor during the third age is strong evidence against the East being underpopulated.  I think it more likely that Professor Tolkien's late writings are correct, and a unified East and South would have inevitably overwhelmed the far inferior population of the North.

 

Given that this cycle is producing a corsair Hero and the next cycle is supposed to challenge our preconceptions about the Haradrim, I would not be surprised if FFG depicts the Haradrim as not completely unified or completely hostile to the Free Peoples.  We shall see.

It's also possible that after the destruction of Sauron the power vacuum leads to further fracturing and infighting, allowing Aragorn and Eomer to possibly even ally with some groups in getting rid of the troublesome elements.

Yes, the Istari are a specially selected group of Maiar, chosen by the Valar, given bodies, and sent to middle earth to oppose Sauron.  Sauron is also a Maiar.  All the Istari are from a group of Maiar serving the Valar, of which only one (Saruman) is known to have sought personal dominance over middle earth.  Sauron is the most prominent of a group of Maiar serving Melkor, of which only one (Sauron) is known to have sought personal dominance over middle earth.  Bombadil also appears to be a Maiar never in active service to the Valar or Melkor, and while Bombadil is a pretty unique fellow, he's not alone in that description either (Melian also fits).  Neither he nor Melian ever sought personal dominance over middle earth.  Your general rule has a startling lack of examples.

 

Durin's Bane is clearly deferred to by the orcs of Moria (with good reason), but it is not clear that he orders them in any fashion, or had any hand in assembling them.  Durin's Bane was hiding out when the dwarves uncovered him, very far from seeking dominance.  Once in possession of Moria, he did nothing with it as far as we can tell.  The Dwarf/Goblin war was orchestrated by Azog, who the orcs of Moria clearly *did* take orders from, and in the Hobbit the Goblins take orders from the Great Goblin and Bolg, respectively.  There's no textual evidence that any of the Misty Mountains goblins outside of their range are operating under orders from Durin's Bane, nor does he do anything to expand Moria's influence during the many centuries he was unopposed there.

 

Gandalf's lack of a permanent power base shows that he is not in any way seeking (or achieving) personal dominance, as Faramir perceived, he is a mover of others and his power is largely confined to that.  Others assemble and command the armies, others acquire power as a result of Gandalf's meddling and have the freedom of action to use it how they will.  It's not just a different style than Saruman's approach, it's a different thing all together, and the goal is simply and solely the overthrow of Sauron.  The only time his power is actually augmented is when he is returned to life as Gandalf the White, and that was not a turn of events Gandalf either sought or anticipated.

 

His "significant history" in the courts of Rohan and Gondor in the text amount to a maximum of four visits during Faramir's lifetime to Gondor prior to the War of the Ring, neither seeking nor gaining influence from Denethor, and at least one visit to Theoden's court prior to the War of the Ring, the last obtaining Shadowfax but incurring ill will from the King.

 

In the council of Elrond, it is Elrond who conducts and presides, and Elrond who accepts Frodo as the ringbearer and charges him.  Elrond defers to Gandalf only in the selection of Merry and Pippin for the fellowship, but it is again Elrond ultimately making the decision.  Gandalf and Glorfindel flank Elrond at the dinner, but from the text I think it more likely that Glorfindel is on the right -- not that it amounts in the least to either seeking or receiving power.  Elrond was one person who needed no moving to oppose the designs of Sauron.

 

The protection of heirs of Arnor and the long-planned Return of the King are intimately connected with Elrond, not Gandalf.  It is Elrond who protects and houses the heirs, it is Elrond who tells him his heritage and give shim the ring of Barahir and the shards of Narsil.  It is Elrond who gives Aragorn the charge to become king of Gondor and Arnor.  Gandalf's specific involvement in the return of the king, aside from endangering Aragorn's life in difficult and largely unpublicized tasks, is constricted to finding a shoot of the White Tree.  Denethor's paranoia is ill-founded.

 

There's no evidence that Gandalf or anyone in Arnor had anything to do with inventing or spreading the "hands of the healer" legend.  Ioreth was wishing for a King of Gondor, not Arnor, and there's no reason to suppose it originates from anything other than the healing capabilites of long-ago kings of Gondor.  The lore master's doggerel about Athelas also mentions the king's hand.

 

Nor is there much of a contrast between Aragorn and the brothers in the healing department.  Aragorn had already put on some dramatic "public displays", what with winning two battles, saving the day, and displaying the royal banner.  But he went to the house of healing *at night*, cloaked and bearing no token other than his elf-stone, explicitly saying that he is only entering because Gandalf begged him to, and only as Captain of the Dunedain of Arnor.  Gandalf repeats Ioreth's saying, but the audience is Eomer, Imrahil, and Aragorn, all well aware of Aragorn's claim and already accepting it.  In the presence of Ioreth and the lore master, Aragorn does not identify himself and is called "your lordship" and "a captain of war".  Ioreth doesn't realize who it is until the awakened Faramir spills the beans by calling him King -- and Ioreth being Ioreth, it quickly gets around.  After his initial praise of Ioreth, Gandalf takes no hand at all in identifying or publicizing Aragorn's true identity.  For his part, Aragorn sends word to the brothers to come help him, laboring into the night, and leaving under cloak of darkness.  With his banner furled, the good citizens of Minas Tirith "wondered if the coming of the King had been but a dream."

 

If Peter Jackson perceived that Gandalf's actions or motivations were not selfless or benevolent, that's hardly evidence that it was true.  Jackson did extreme violence to the characters of LOTR at his whim.  What he did to Faramir was appalling.

 

Yes, the ring was a trap, and Gandalf wisely feared -- as did Elrond at the council and Galadriel when freely offered the ring.  But if your motivation is "dominance over middle earth", the ring is *not* a trap.  It would accomplish exactly that in the hand of the powerful.  But dominance was not sought or desired by Gandalf, who pitied the slaves of Sauron.  He laid out his motivations clearly to Denethor, even though that paranoid worthy didn't believe him.  "Unless the king should come again?  Well, my lord Steward, it is your task to keep some kingdom still against that event, which few now look to see.  In that task you shall have all the aid that you are pleased to ask for.  But I will say this:  the rule of no realm is mine, neither of Gondor nor any other, great or small.  But all worthy things that are in peril as the world now stands, those are my care.  And for my part, I shall not wholly fail of my task, though Gondor should perish, if anything passes through this night that can still grow fair or bear fruit and flower again in days to come.  For I also am a steward.  Did you not know?"

 

Gandalf did not raise or lead armies himself, though he aided others in doing so.  But that was not his goal, and he could succeed at his goal without crushing his enemies.  Indeed, he knew there was no hope at all of crushing his enemies.  He made that abundantly clear in the last debate.

 

"Victory cannot be achieved by arms, whether you sit here to endure siege after siege, or march out to be overwhelmed beyond the River."  Naturally he counsels them to march out to be overwhelmed beyond the River.  "We must walk open-eyed into that trap, with courage, but small hope for ourselves.  For my lords, it may well prove that we ourselves shall perish utterly in a black battle far from the living lands; so that even if Barad-dur be thrown down, we shall not live to see a new age.  But this, I deem, is our duty.  And better so than to perish nonetheless--as we surely shall, if we sit here--and know as we die that no new age shall be."

 

I find this utterly irreconcilable to a thesis that seeking power and dominance is just something that Maiar naturally do, except for Radagast.  And when Gandalf's designs were accomplish and Sauron was overthrown, with the rule of Gondor and Arnor committed to his good friend Aragorn, Gandalf retired from his labors, not even bothering to help the hobbits scour the shire, just marking the time until he could go home.

 

Motivation is in the eye of the beholder, so YMMV.  But in my eyes, your generalization about Maiar does Jackson-like violence to what I see in the text.

It's difficult to feel sorry for someone who spends 120 years as the richest, most powerful man in middle earth while married to one of the three most beautiful elves ever.

And this, of course, leads to a climactic confrontation with the Dark Lord's minions—but with a twist that may have your heroes questioning their long-held beliefs.

 

My guess the twist is that the Harad are being tortured and forced to do the dark lords bidding in some way or another. I was wondering how they'd get this cycle by the PC people, and I think I found it.

It's like what we see in real countries, too.  They probably had some corrupt leaders who followed Sauron for their own purposes.  Some people followed either out of selfish or ideological motivations.  Some disagreed and either followed anyway out of fear or fought against the corruption, getting killed in the process or being driven into hiding.  Still others probably just saw soldiering as a job and didn't think about the reasons one way or another.

Playtester? Please?

 

But yeah, I've been calling for that for awhile now, and this seems like a good time. So like the end of the cycle is Rhun, so that you are right near dale.

We need something in the frozen north. Maybe a journey to try and recover the lost Palantiri sunk in the Ice-bay.

Or maybe the next cycle (after Sands of Harad) is set in Rhun, and then they move onto Dale and the far north in the cycle following that?

No.  Forochel and Rhun are nowhere near each other.

http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Forochel [http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Forochel]

It was a region north of Arnor where the last king of Arthedain, Arvedui, fled when Angmar conquered his kingdom, with the two Palantiri from Annuminas and Amon Sul that sunk to the bottom of the Ice-bay with him.

> What's in Rhun?

A melange of different Eastern cultures. On the rivers flowing into the northern side of the Sea of Rhun is an analogue "Kievan-Rus" culture called Dorwinion where it appears (Tolkien is pretty vague) Northmen rule local Easterlings and trade up the River to Dale. The bearded Easterlings with Axes who took part in the Battle of Pelennor Fields might have been these guys. You then have the remains of the Wainriders who are a nomadic steppes culture living in large caravans. Then there are the remains of the Balchoth who I've seen some people posit as a Mongol type culture living in Yurts. In reality Tolkien didn't say too much about these guys so there is plenty of design space for FFG to come up with their own ideas. We do know that they fell under the shadow, but whether this was because they wanted to, or were defeated by Sauron we can't tell.

If you google "Merp map Forochel" you'll see that its a massive snowbound area. In older times it was where Angband was based so you could easily develop a cycle around finding ancient weapons or investigating primordial evil fortresses etc.

Forochel is definitely not where Angband was based. Angband was north of Beleriand, which was all to the west of the Middle Earth we deal with in the Third Age, and also extended noticeably further north.

Sorry you're right. To clarify, Angband has been drowned but the Iron Mountains which it was a part of extended further eastwards, and they still survive. Morgoth could easily have had other fortresses there. I don't appear to be able to show an image but if you google "map forochel" the mountain range can easily be seen and in the Third Age it does extend quite far west as well.

Nope, I do not see that. If you have a source, cite it rather than expecting me to find it myself, because the only map I recall which lines up Beleriand with third age Middle Earth is this one which was in the Master of Lore article on To the Sea! To the Sea! : https://masteroflore.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/beleriand-reshaped-map.jpeg [https://masteroflore.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/beleriand-reshaped-map.jpeg]

As you can see, that map doesn't actually go far enough north to include the iron mountains, but Forochel is on it; and like most of the rest of third age Middle Earth, it is separated from Beleriand by the Blue Mountains.

First thing - I am sorry that I didn't link a picture (I did try) but nonetheless please remain polite and positive if you communicate with me. My policy is never to respond to (or even read) rude or aggressive posts, so you are wasting your time if you do this.

 

The bottom line is that other maps do exist. Here is one http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Aanaar [http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Aanaar] The pic is a little small but clicking on it magnifies it. Here's another http://merp.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Forochel [http://merp.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Forochel] I don't know if Tolkien actually ever drew a map of northern Forodwaith but he did write about the massive bay of Forochel and the Iron Mountains, so I would argue that there is design space.

 

P.S I genuinely think the map you have linked to is incorrect. The scales are out with Beleriand appearing much larger than it should (there's no way it is as large as the rest of Middle Earth leading beyond the Sea of Rhun for example).

Forochel isn't where Angband was, but it was where two palantiri sank, so I could easily see a rumor of them causing the Free Peoples and servants of the shadow to race to try to find them (if, indeed, they could be found).

I am a Little sad to see another objective ally (pretty sure he is not a hero, more a ressourceful n character form :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]), but at least he seems to be useful once again (still hate this stupid dwarf from the ringmaker cycle...). I miss the quests where you don't have to use or protect stuff, but maybe this is because the latest cycle has them in nearly every quest.

Argh I'm actually really excited for this stuff. Harad is one of my favorite areas of ME, and I've always been interested to learn more of its people & culture, etc. But I'd have to go on a massive buying spree to reach this expansion by its release haha

 

I like the objective/obj ally aspects, but would rather they serve a purpose to your quest, as opposed to the Dol Guldur and Sign of Gollum objectives, where you hold them just to pass a particular quest stage and then they're actually hurting you.

 

Recently played Massing at Osgiliath for the first time and the Ranger obj allies were awesome. One was dealt as a shadow card that literally saved my skin.

 

This Haradrim ally looks like he'll be useful to control, adding a resource to a hero's pool each resource phase.

 

EDIT: Sorry, at the beginning of the planning phase.

Well, of those scales 2 out of 2 would also kill you at 56°. I demand a more realistic scale in the game.

How high a temperature can humans survive?

 

The highest recorded temperature in nature is 56.7 °C (134 °F), in Death Valley in 1913.

 

That said, saunas are sometimes greater than 100 °C, water's boiling point. Humans can survive such high temperatures for short periods of time if the air humidity is quite low.

 

According to this link [https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-highest-temperature-a-human-being-can-survive] (which doesn't give its sources but seems to fit with other info online):

 

> With enough water, you'd survive 24 hours of exposure to 45°C air temperatures-- I still wouldn't recommend it-- but not the 80°C of a sauna.

> 
> For air, we use the "wet bulb temperature"... which the coolest we can get our skin temperature by sweating. There, the danger point is 35°C (95 °F). That might sound low, but even in the hottest days in the deserts, the wet bulb temperature almost never gets close to that. If it's 55 °C in Death Valley with a typical summer dewpoint of 0 °C, the wet-bulb temperature is only 23 °C.

The Sahara Desert's average annual humidity is 25%, though it is often significantly lower. Given these numbers, I think 60 °C (140 °F) is a reasonable loss condition. It's possible to survive in the short term with temperatures in the upper 50s (130s), but I expect many encounter card effects will be much more punishing in that range.

I agree with your conclusion. I've been to plenty of deserts around the world.

Sahara, atacama, kalahari to name a few. Also Death Valley.

Conditions are harsh, and water is indeed life.

But it does not get anywhere near 60c.

Use an extra threat counter. But if you don't have an extra threat counter, you'd have to use pen-and-paper, or dice, or something.

So cool! That Archer is great with Celeborn, especially when you can spam him mid-round with The Tree People. But as is, a 2 cost 2 attack Leadership ally (not to mention Silvan, so 1 cost) is nuts. Love this card.

 

Bounder, 1) reminds me of an old LOTR TCG card from the first set, the Bounder who gets his head cut off by a Nazgul for nothing during Frodo's and Gandalf's conversation in FOTR, 2) has one of my favorite arts as of late, and 3) is really **** good! Any side quest deck will want x3 of this guy. Now that I think of it, the great thing about the side quest mechanic is that you only need 1 side quest in the victory display to trigger all your effects, from which this Bounder seems like one of the best.

 

Sadly I'm not sure about The Road Goes Ever On and On. It's an iconic song and theme of the books, but I just think that any side quest deck will already run Dúnedain Message or Thurindir anyway both of which are much easier. Now granted I don't think we have a new side quest Leadership ally, so maybe Leadership would be kind of wasted, but I still think it'd be playable in a side quest deck without Leadership if it attached to a location instead. You'll want your side quest effects before even defeating the first stage in many scenarios. And if you're going to attach this to a side quest you or your partner already played, then what's the urgency of getting another one? All your side quest effects will already be playable. Maybe for that +1 wp on Thurindir? Or 1 more damage from Dour Handed? Not sure if convinced.

 

John Constantine convinced me of the value of Erebor Guard. At first I was really meh about it but yeah, in a Caldara deck he's great It's another way like Emery to discard stuff from your deck, and you want to get Prince Imrahil into the discard ASAP, so now I really like him.

 

@John Constantine, In a silvan deck the archer is fine if you have Galadriel with Nenya and no Unexpected. Draw and reduce, then ready to add 4 to the quest. I still think his greatest asset is his 2 attack though.

Quick review:

 

Greenwood Archer.

Weird. Not only because a hero rarely needs to be readied during the planning phase (I do realize he is supposed to be put into play by various game effects, yet still it is usually good to have an application for the card it is played in usual way), but also because none of the currently existing Leadership heroes possess any pritned self-exhausting ability, so this needs to be multisphered into something at the very least. But I like the concept.

 

 

Erebor Guard.

Super awesum. 2 cost 0/1/2/3 is incredible. It also fuels dwarven mill and Caldara alike. And it is also a body that costs 4 which you play for 2, which means a huge Very Good Tale potential when crossed with Leadership.

 

 

Halfling Bounder.

The encounter deck controls are real. Soon, poor encounter deck will be getting any 'when revealed' effect it'll try to sneak in showed into it's mouth. Good standard stats 1/1/0/2 make this a decent deel, a better deal if you actually run a side quest setup, and even more better deal if you'll actually manage to clear one of them :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

 

Well Warned.

Threat reduction for nothing, what more can you ask for? Maybe to share it with your friends? Oh wait, it already does that!

 

 

Dour-handed.

I find it to be a strange card, as initially it'll sit in your hand while reading "pay 1 to deal 0 damage". How much side quests can you realistically clear without severely hindering your effort on the main one? I find a cost of 1 to be strange, especially when it limits the range of possible targets to the ones engaged with you. There is Goblin-cleaver which does 2-3 damage for 0 by merely exhausting a weapon, and equipping a weapon is far more easily done than clearing a side-quest.

 

 

The Road Goes Ever On.

All hail the first official Lore Song! As for the quality of this card - I dunno. They seem to put a lot of emphasis on clearing tons of side quests in this new cycle, so maybe that'll be really a thing. I, for one, don't see myself clearing more than 1-2 side quests per game. I hope they change my mind once set comes out.

Most of the encounter side quests in LR/AA have victory point indicators, so those quests will fuel side-quest cards even without adding player side quests (which those same quests tend to punish).  Enough to make Dour-handed worth it?  I doubt it.

Greenwood Archer makes Silverlode Archer look even sadder.  I agree the ability isn't likely to be useful in the resource phase (except as a combo with Captain's Wisdom), but it's a solid card in a silvan deck without its ability kicking in.

A neutral or two is missing?

 

Ok, so we have:

2 heroes

3 leadships

3 spirits

2 lores

2 tactics

1 neutral.

 

Lore and Tactics feel like they both missing a card, as if we count heroes, both Spirit and Leadship got 4 cards each.

 

 

Also... no Harad player cards. Man, I feel like it's a really bad sign, as the Harad support they'll be dishing out throught the cycle gonna be half-assed, even despite the spoiled reducer ally. Assuming Harad is going to be in 1-2 spheres and not strictly neutral, how much space in the remaining cycle can they really deadicate to it?.. I'm sad.

Considering it's called the Haradrim cycle, I'd hope a lot of space. Think of Silvan. There was no Silvan stuff in Voice of Isengard, just Doomed and Rohan, and ironically Silvan became a fully formed deck just with that cycle, better even than Doomed or Rohan.

If you squint at the spoilers' card IDs, I think along with the previously announced cards, 1-13 is covered, so I don't think there's another Tactics card in the wings. #13 is that neutral sidequest... They wouldn't usually number something in a single expansion past that, would they?

Probably wouldn't, but to go back to 13 player cards after three straight deluxes with 15 is disappointing.  You have to go back to the first deluxe to find only 13 player cards.

Maybe because the sidequests are good in and of themselves even without this additional support?

Varies depending on quest, but sometimes 4 is definitely not out of the question, at which point Dour-handed would kill a decent number of enemies outright.

I read Bounder as Bouncer haha.

 

Encounter card walks up to the club doors.

 

Halfling Bouncer holds up his hand, "Whoa, whoa whoa. Where do you think you're going huh? You're name on the list?"

 

Encounter card looks down sheepishly, "Yeah...? Necromancer's Reach..."

 

Halfling Bouncer glances at the list, shaking his head. "Nah, you ain't on the list. No name, no entry. Now scram. I don't want to see your face here again."

 

I think I like the Halfling Bouncer. :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

Overall a little dissapointed in these spoilers but the ones we already had for this deluxe were pretty great so it balances out.

 

Greenwood doesn't seem very good outside of Silvan decks and that ability is next to useless during planning except for Captain's Wisdom type shenanigans. 1 hitpoint always makes me sad as well :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

 

Erebor Guard's ability is only good in self mill decks in pretty much any other deck his ability can be harmful as you could be losing valuable cards. Even in Noldor this isn't good as you want to discard cards from your hand not from the top of your deck. Defensive allies with 2 or less defense usually aren't worth it in my opinion if they don't have some killer ability on top. This guy is good in a dedicated dwarf mill deck or Caldara deck but looks super average in other decks.

 

Halfling bounder is the best of the lot. We finally have an ally that be discarded in an emergency to cancel the when revealed effects of an encounter card. He also has 2 hitpoints which means he will hopefully stick around till you need that ability and 1/1 (in willpower and attack) is not bad for two cost especially in lore. It also makes him valuable until you need to/are able to use his cancel effect which means he doesn't just sit around until you need his ability. You do need a sidequest in the victory display but this isn't too hard to achieve even using decks that only feature a few sidequests as there are plenty of cards to fetch them. As others have mentioned he is a boss in the Lost Realm/Angmar cycle because of encounter side quests. I really love this ally but wish this ability had been on a dunedain or noldor ally. Then again we did get Dunedain Lookout (or whatever he is called) that can cancel the when revealed effects on an enemy so I guess we sort of did and I am being extremely picky :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

 

Well Warned is pretty decent... I like that it can be used on any player. Noble and Scout isn't too hard to achieve. I think for me the annoying thing with these cards that need two traits is that some of them will be great for our decks but we wont have the traits (on heroes at least) to play them right away or as consistently as we'd like so we have to consider whether there are enough allies with the trait you need included in your deck to cover the fact you don't have that trait on a hero or if it is worth changing our decks just to include these. I know that really if anything this opens up deckbuilding and strategy further but its going to be frustrating to see cards that could be really great in your decks but require you to potentially change your hero lineup for them to be viable. I guess this is true of just about any card though (you need Galadriel for her mirror don't you!) so I am being a little silly. Zero cost for a bit of threat reduction is always nice and unlike Elrond's Counsel this can be used on any player.

 

Dour Handed outside of a dedicated side quest deck (which I realise is going to be the new type of deck) seems useless and while there are always plenty of niche cards it would nice if it wasn't a completely dead card without having several side quests in the victory display. Even with 2 or even maybe 3 side quests in the victory display this is still only doing 2 to 3 direct damage for 1 cost. Like John said compare this to Goblin Cleaver which does 2/3 damage for 0 and just requires a weapon attachment which is like a million times easier than clearing a sidequest. Almost all other direct damage cards seem better than this one for some reason.

The Road Goes Ever on is sort of like Dunedain Message but for 0 cost in lore. It does let any player search for a side quest not just the player using it which is better than Message. It does only trigger when you beat the quest it is attached to though and therein lies what I think is the massive restriction to this card. So you want to play side quests as early as possible so you can clear them and receive their effects (especially these new ones that provide a constant effect for the rest of the game) to advance your board state. This card only lets you go and get a side quest once you clear a quest stage already in play. Admittedly this can be used on another side quest (which is the optimal use it seems) but if there isn't already a side quest in play this has to be put on the main quest and you might not see its effect for several turns. I used to use The Long Defeat which I thought was a really cool card but in practise was just so extremely hit and miss and I think this card is just like The Long Defeat in that regard. In a side quest deck it might be good just so you can chain side quests together and try to keep one in play consistently to help cards like East Road Ranger though I guess.

Admittedly I am usually slow to see cool combos or interactions with new player cards and am also overly harsh with my opinion of them and gradually warm up or change my opinion over time but some of these are really average to me. Lucky I love the new heroes so much!

Already starting to change my mind about Greenwood Archer big time. He is great with Captain's Wisdom, Send for Aid and honestly one of the best targets for sneak attack in my opinion. 1 resource for a 2 attack ranged ally and another use out of any hero (emergency defense, extra attacker, vilya, ranger bow etc) and then you can potentially use his ability again when you get him into play the second time.

The Road Goes Ever On + Thurindir is a pretty good start for a side quest deck. One side quest in your hand and Road Goes Ever On finds another when you clear the first.

Use Thurindir to start with Gather Information. Clear it first turn and each player gets to search their deck for a card then you use Road Goes Ever On to find Send for Aid and put it into play the following turn. Clear Send for Aid on the second turn and each player gets to search the top ten cards for an ally and play it for free. That's a pretty awesome first two turns that only costs you a single leadership resource to play Send for Aid. It does mean no progress on the main quest for two turns though which reallt isn't an option for certain quests.

Any side quest deck will want x3 of this guy. Now that I think of it, the great thing about the side quest mechanic is that you only need 1 side quest in the victory display to trigger all your effects, from which this Bounder seems like one of the best.

> Sadly I'm not sure about The Road Goes Ever On and On. It's an iconic song and theme of the books, but I just think that any side quest deck will already run Dúnedain Message or Thurindir anyway both of which are much easier. Now granted I don't think we have a new side quest Leadership ally, so maybe Leadership would be kind of wasted, but I still think it'd be playable in a side quest deck without Leadership if it attached to a location instead. You'll want your side quest effects before even defeating the first stage in many scenarios. And if you're going to attach this to a side quest you or your partner already played, then what's the urgency of getting another one? All your side quest effects will already be playable. Maybe for that +1 wp on Thurindir? Or 1 more damage from Dour Handed? Not sure if convinced.
> 
>  
> 
>  

I like both the Bounder (obviously) and the Song. My side quest deck is Beorn Rossiel Thurundir right now and it fits perfectly. I am not sure about the number. I probably only start with one as the slots get ever so precious but, it will still be a good card to draw, I feel. I almost always mulligan for a side quest, in order to have two to begin with. And then when you have the Road Goes Ever On, it should become a free card, the cost of 0 is really nice here.

 

By the way, I am not sure I saw it mentioned, have others include the Long Defeat in their side quests decks? Seems like a particularly useful opening card there, especially with Thurundir (I know I may be in minority playing the unreleased cards, but still). [edit] I just saw Psychorocka describing his negative experience with the card, I think this may change for you with Thurundir, it certainly did for me once I got the ranger on board.

 

Mirkwood Archer is alright I feel. It doesn't particularly scream for its place in my Galadhrim deck but it will probably make it. Is good if you have Nenya on Galadriel, or if in your other deck is someone like Denethor, Beravor or Elrond.

 

I have not yet tried the Dwarf discard deck but I am aware it is getting ever more intriguing. Zigil Miner currently sides with the Noldor, though.

 

Well Warned seems ok, though feels best paired with the Hobbits (Smoke Rings) who might have a hard time finding a Noble and a Scout among them.

 

More direct damage is nice but you really have to commit to the strategy and then still it only works against particular quests. Not sure I will play this any time soon.

> Yay for more cancellation. The mono Lore decks are getting better and better now that we don't need to rely on spirit for cancellation.

with The Storm Comes, it doesn't need mono Lore. hell, it doesn't need Lore at all...

honestly, Halfling Bounder is pretty crazy. only costs 2 and can quest or attack for 1 until you need to discard him, plus he has 2 hit points, so he's a bit less vulnerable to damaging treacheries (so you don't automatically discard him to cancel something like Necromancer's Reach because 'he's going to die anyway'

also, i'm glad to see a playable 'reprint' of Silverlode Archer

Yes, basically I meant something along those lines. I too run Gather Inofrmation in the deck above, obviously but both Scout Ahead and The Storm Comes I prefer in almost every quest I play. The latter is so good to help sooth resources, especially in coop. And the former is just gold for Rossiel and makes The Door is Closed almost immediately useful.

my partner plays a Silvan deck with Galadriel, Elrond, and Celeborn.

Galadriel and Elrond, with their rings, can exhaust during the planning phase and receive an immediate ready (i also love the thought of using Elrond + Vilya to bring Greenwood Archer into play, readying Elrond)

i know you've started to change your mind on Greenwood Archer, but it seems a lot of the criticisms are 'this card doesn't work well outside of the deck it was designed to work in, therefore it's not a good card', and i honestly can't disagree more.

just because a card doesn't have universal appeal doesn't mean it's a bad card. as i mentioned above, Greenwood Archer is great in Silvan decks. but outside of that, he's also a 2 for 2 ranged attacker in Leadership of all things. he could have a blank ability, and i'd consider him pretty useful tbh.

Erebor Guard's ability of discarding outside of intentional self-mill isn't that much of a problem tbh, because you're discarding two cards that may as well have been on the bottom of your deck. 2 resources for a 2def 3hp sentinel, in Spirit of all things, is pretty solid imo. it's just that his 'downside' is a potential gain when you build your deck for Hidden Caches, Caldara discard spam, etc.

as for Dour-handed, i think it's kind of an unknown. it'll likely get a lot better in multiplayer with many different side quests entering the victory display, and as you said, only really useful in a dedicated side quest deck, but even then, how many side quests can you really get in a deck that's packing Tactics? Delay the Enemy isn't very good tbh. Keep Watch is a lot better, but limit 1 in the victory display.

you'll likely want to go dual or trisphere to get enough side quests, and then how is Dour-handed going to fit into the deck anyway? i actually think it's a terrible card in that i doubt i'd ever find it useful, wished i had put it in my deck instead, and i think i'll likely find many instances where i wished i had a different direct damage event instead.

Just to comment on a few sentiments above. Yes, clearing side quests is not easy. Not for every quest for sure and often good only at certain stages of quests. The tactics card thus seems utterly terribly, just like the Last Stance we got last time. That said, it is true that clearing side quests is a very good thing, if you have time and resources for it.

 

Scout Ahead cleared on round 1, usually gives such an advantage for the next two rounds that you really feel like you own the encounter deck (2-player experience mostly). The best example may be A Journey in the Dark, where you are oft instructed to discard encounter cards.

 

Checking back the previously spoiled cards, Vigilant Dúnadan is ok but not great unless you can buff him somehow which is not always easy with allies. Tale of Tinúviel or Narya would be good but you'd need him exhausted first, right?

Yes, with the cost of 2 in Leadership, 2 attack and Silvan trait, it is hardly to be a miss. The ability is super strong even if the timing may be an issue sometimes.

## 190 [dalestephenson on October 15, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/224887-the-sands-of-harad/?do=findComment&comment=2458358)

To put things in perspective, here's the previous two-or-less cost options for 2 attack in Leadership:

 

Ceorl (unique)

Dwaven Sellsword (one cost, but you have to keep paying)

Dunedain Wanderer -- if you are in secrecy, 5 cost otherwise

 

So 2 attack for 2 cost, with no restrictions, is already good, and the ranged makes it better.

 

Captain's Wisdom is the obvious combo, but Greenwood can also be used with We Are Not Idle and a dwarf hero.  For multi-sphere decks, he combos with Galadriel (with Nenya), Beravor, Argalad (if he can reduce a threat to zero), LoDenethor, Healing Herbs (on a hero), Vilya, Ranger Bow (on a hero), Palantir, Athelas (on a hero), Narya (if you have exhausted allies), Rain of Arrows, Quick Strike, Ancestral Knowledge, Hail of Stones, Word of Command (with Gandalf hero), Hands Upon the Bow, Peace and Thought, Distant Stars, The Houses of Healing, and Ravens of the Mountain.

 

Now a good part of those you'd never plan to put together, but if you're running one of those cards already and have access to Leadership, Greenwood Archer might be something to consider.

I like this ally because it makes you think about interesting card combos. I can think of a few uses it might have even with all leadership heroes:

- Captain's Wisdom

- Palantir

- Amarthiul+Quick Strike

 

But one of the reasons I most like the guy is going to be his ability to offset the cost of Peace and Thought.

> By the way, I am not sure I saw it mentioned, have others include the Long Defeat in their side quests decks? Seems like a particularly useful opening card there, especially with Thurundir (I know I may be in minority playing the unreleased cards, but still). [edit] I just saw Psychorocka describing his negative experience with the card, I think this may change for you with Thurundir, it certainly did for me once I got the ranger on board.

Long Defeat is a brilliant card if you're planning on exploring side-quests anyway, either because you're in a multiplayer group where everyone has a side-quest or two or because you're running a dedicated side-quest deck like e.g. this one: http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/1634/side-quests-to-the-left-of-me-enemies-to-the-right-1.0 [http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/1634/side-quests-to-the-left-of-me-enemies-to-the-right-1.0]

Like the side-quests themselves, I think it's something which rises in value as the player count goes up, which may account for some people's skepticism if they don't generally play above 2 player. Seriously though, it's like an Ancient Mathom for everyone at the table, or healing if you need it. Great card.

Greenwood Archer works with:

 

Captain Wisdom (Captain Wisdom on Celeborn > play Greenwood Archer)

Beravor

Galadriel if she has Nenya

Lore Denethor

Some attachments that make your hero exhaust during planning (like Palantir)

Elrond + Vilya

Heroes that were exhausted with Peace and Thought

Random Sword-Thain'd allies

Greenwood Archer is a steal at 2 considering you are going to probably either have O Lorien! or SoG to help pay for him.

> Dour Handed outside of a dedicated side quest deck (which I realise is going to be the new type of deck) seems useless and while there are always plenty of niche cards it would nice if it wasn't a completely dead card without having several side quests in the victory display. Even with 2 or even maybe 3 side quests in the victory display this is still only doing 2 to 3 direct damage for 1 cost. Like John said compare this to Goblin Cleaver which does 2/3 damage for 0 and just requires a weapon attachment which is like a million times easier than clearing a sidequest. Almost all other direct damage cards seem better than this one for some reason.

 

Sure, Goblin Cleaver is better and easier to trigger, but not all tactics use weapons.  My Ent deck uses a few side quests already and has zero weapons in it since Treebeard has no need of them.   This may be a nice situational card to snipe out a few dmg on something.  It also isn't about being as powerful as existing cards, but giving us different options - or MORE options.  Why not utilize both and just murder things outright without engagements?

You are correct. It definitely gives us more options and why not include both in a direct damage deck that features sidequests as well or is run alongside other decks using side quests. It's just such a dead card until you get a few sidequests cleared.

Yes, I am going to run the Bounder and the Closed Door in the same deck and hope to cancel at least as much as I do with the decks including the Test. There is twice as many of them but they are harder to set up and less easy (or not possible in my case) to recycle.

Long time Tolkien and LOTR:LCG fan here. Generally have enjoyed the designers' decisions to take the game in new directions, even if they don't always feel quite true to the lore. For example, I really enjoyed the last cycle even though little written material exists regarding maritime exploration of Middle Earth (yes, there is some, but it's fairly general in nature). For some reason I didn't feel that much excitement about Sands. Indeed, I felt rather ambivalent and a bit uncertain. Just picked up my copy of Sands this afternoon and after quickly assembling the first quest and encounter decks, I now find myself feeling really, really amped up to experience Harad!

Sorry folks, the holidays have intruded. The first quest is DL5 and I've played it twice now. The first game I lost on turn 2, but I feel I drew poorly from both decks (mine and the encounter). The second try I haven't finished yet, but I feel fairly in control... But my threat is at 45.

I am playing with a Three Hunters deck with core Aragorn and the new Legolas and Gimli. I thought it was a fairly decent deck, but I am admittedly struggling. This is partly due to playing a quest with a lot of archery and no lore (only Duendain Remedy) and limited threat reduction. But I am really wondering if my old Strider/Boromir/Glory deck wouldn't fare much better, and that deck I used nearly four years ago in Gondor.

Maybe I just suck at deck building.

So, what about the quest itself?

## 227 [Rob_Oz on November 24, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/224887-the-sands-of-harad/?do=findComment&comment=2513814)

The first quest is almost entirely about enemy management. Indeed, you cannot progress to stage 2 without all players being entirely free of engaged enemies. The same is true for the final stage -  victory cannot occur until all players are free of engaged enemies. The quest stages do not permit over-questing; that is to say they are capped, so you can't stockpile a reserve of progress tokens. Furthermore, the quest has numerous ways of removing progress tokens. Losing progress tokens combined with having to be entirely free of engaged enemies can make completing a stage tricky. If you read the most recent preview article, you also know that the Objective card, Seize Them, will cause you to auto-lose the game if no progress has been placed on the main quest during a round. There are some encounter side quests to contend with as well. As Bullroarer mentioned above, Archery is abundant.

 

I played 2 handed against the quest with a Dunedain/Trap deck (Haldir/Damrod/Amartheul) and a Doomed/Beefy Ally deck (Denethor/Erestor/Loragorn). I went into the quest entirely blind, but found those decks to be relatively effective against it. Hitting Valor via the Doomed deck (Legacy of Numenor and Deep Knowledge) can allow the Dunedain deck to sweep the board free of enemies in one turn via a Valorous Hour of Wrath. Amartheul blocks with Protector of Lorien and Destrier to aid against shadow cards. Boosted Haldir (Ranger Spear, Dunedain Mark, Rivendell Blade) and Amartheul can often kill all the enemies in one fell swoop. I've played the quest twice so far. I believe I won the first time, but may have overlooked some card effects, so I played it again tonight and won via Hour of Wrath. The quest is fun; it does a good job of creating a chase scene as the encounter deck has numerous ways of forcing you to engage enemies (Locations play a part in evoking a chase-like feel as well). The art and mechanics of the Harad (Southrons) is quite reminiscent of Into Ithilien, which I just happened to play within the last week. Enjoying the box so far!

## 228 [Bullroarer Took on November 24, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/224887-the-sands-of-harad/?do=findComment&comment=2514137)

RobOz covered it pretty well. The quest is challenging to be sure and I don't think people will be saying it's not worthy of being a DL5.

Two stages, each requiring 15 progress, but not only are there cards that remove progress, there are other conditions that prevent you from advancing. Additionally, the quest cards cannot have more than 15 progress on them. So you can't overstock the quest card. As an example, on the last turn I played Gandalf (core) and made a massive push towards the finish line. The board was clear. Revealed "Nowhere to Hide" which makes me put an enemy into play engaged with me by flipping cards from the encounter deck. I flipped Southron Archer, archery 2 and the forced effect of either remove two progress from the quest or discard an ally you control. Of course it was Gandalf and luckily I was able to place the 15 progress.

But you can't win the last stage if an enemy is engaged with you. I was able to ready the Three Hunters through various effects and dispatch the Archer for the win, threat at 46. A very near thing.

The quest starts from where the last adventure pack ends. Literally seconds after if you follow the storyline. You are stranded and have to escape the city. I think that thematically they really nailed it. There is a location card "Narrow Alleyway" that forces you to put an enemy engaged with you under it after you travel to it. (You have eluded your pursuer!). But when explored you must place the enemy back in the staging area. (After leaving the alley he picks up your trail!)

Really well done.

## 232 [tricil on November 24, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/224887-the-sands-of-harad/?do=findComment&comment=2514178)

Agree with Bullroarer. I think the theme is quite solid. As he indicated, the quest begins immediately after the conclusion of City of the Corsairs. Narrow Alleyway was one of my favorite cards in the encounter deck. It grants a previously unseen positive effect for a location which later has a drawback. Furthermore, the card is not plentiful, so you have to decide whether you want to use it quickly or save it for an enemy you deem worse. The location cards generally operate on the chase theme when they become the active location - some sort of mechanic will trigger that forces you to engage enemies or remove progress from the main quest. One of the encounter side quests has some new tricks to it as well. Thankfully, I managed to avoid it in the two games I played.

 

The quest concludes with the heroes fleeing out the gates of Umbar and into the desert. That scene segues right into the second quest, which I have not played yet. I usually try to win about 3 games against a non-brutal quest, so I'll likely try Escape from Umbar a couple more times before moving on to Desert Crossing (Quest #2). I did glimpse briefly at the encounter cards for Desert Crossing; the desert-themed artwork looked great! As I mentioned in an earlier post, I was oddly ambivalent about the Harad cycle despite being tolerant of the designers forays into material that could be deemed un-thematic or not holding true to Middle Earth lore. But as I sifted through the encounter cards for Sands, I found myself feeling pretty motivated to play the quests.

 

Just glanced very briefly at The Long Arm of Mordor. It seems to continue the escape/travel theme by having the heroes make their way toward a jungle. I could see this cycle being the reverse of Dream-chaser. In that cycle we were the pursuers. In this, we appear to be the pursued.

 

I got the distinct sense that Matt and Caleb have decided to more strongly connect the narrative for the Deluxe cycles (as we saw at the end of Angmar Awakened and beginning of Dream-chaser). The beginning of Sands certainly seems to continue this approach. I like it.

I'm now one for three. (Playing true solo.) I can see that there are a few deck archetypes that will do well against this quest. (My old elves deck for example.) But I really don't want to spoil too much more.

Had a chance to play quest #2, Desert Crossing. The quest is exactly what it says it is; a classic desert trek. Think Dune or Athas (if you're familiar with the Dungeons and Dragons Dark Sun setting). Players must deal with the Temperature mechanic (as revealed in an earlier preview article), desert creatures, desert features (locations) and weather treacheries that play off the desert setting and the Temperature mechanic. Thematically, the heat, thirst, weather conditions, and marauding desert beasts slowly wear away the heroes' stamina over the course of the quest.

 

I managed a win with the same two decks I played against the first scenario, a Trap/Dunedain deck and a Doomed/Beefy ally deck. I quested through with exactly enough willpower to complete the last stage, thanks to Sword that was Broken + a double Faramir boost off of Grim Resolve. I avoided the smattering of encounter side quests in my play-through of Desert Crossing. Hitting one or more of these side quests would have really screwed me up. On the surface, the quest doesn't seem too hard, but it has numerous minor card effects that I think make it deceptively hard. Need to play it a few more times to get a better handle on it.

 

For those who are interested, difficulties are:

 

Escape from Umbar: DL 5

Desert Crossing: DL 6

The Long Arm of Mordor: DL 7 (haven't played this yet).

 

FFG difficulty levels are notoriously unreliable, but I'd say the ratings for the first two quests are in the ball-park, though I think I'd bump the first quest up to a 6.

Now 1 of 4.  You really want your starting threat low for this quest which is a bit paradoxical since they are giving you a new Gimli & Legolas.  On to the next one but I expect more of the same.

 

(I've gone back to playing one handed because of the overhead involved with playing two handed.)

2 for 5. This time my deck worked as designed and the quest seemed easy. On to the desert!

Bullroarer,

 

I'd be interested in hearing some of the details about your Three Hunters deck and what you think about the new Legolas and Gimli heroes.  I have been wanting to build a viable solo deck around those three since I got my core set (like I'm sure a lot of folks have).  My copy of Sands arrived today, but I'm at work till tomorrow morning :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

 

I have been thinking of an attachment heavy deck with Loragorn (for some access to card draw to fuel Legolas and healing) and the Rune-master attachment to cheaply turn everyone into beasts with the signals.  Steward and Narvi's on Gimli, knives on Legolas, Master of Forge to fish out all the attachments.  Have all the attachments/events pretty much figured out, less sure about which allies to put in.  Accepting a difference in spheres, who did you use ally wise?  I like the idea of just a few high cost/value allies, but...with a tri-sphere deck?  maybe not...

Epic win!!! I almost mucked it on the last turn but one, and I probably spent three minutes planning my last turn and hoping for a benign location on the quest. Phew!

For this quest the temperature starts at 10, but increases by 4 every turn (even if other card effects don't increase it further.) Just nasty. I would have been much better off with a play set of Wardens. Bring your green cards! Can't believe I won that without Lore.

Such a good quest. Attacks from a different dimension. We've had quests that attack your threat dial before, but there are cards that can deal with threat. This one essentially attacks your threat and doesn't allow you to reduce. Even if everything goes your way - and it won't - you have 13 turns tops.

As an almost exclusively solo player, I'd definitely go with Loragorn. Acesss to easy card draw and Coney on a Trap (in the 1st Haradrim pack), will be clutch I suspect.

Tell you what... You finish your deck and then I'll post mine. I don't want to "poison" your mind. I'm not really happy with mine frankly. It plays like a bad twins deck. Boromir (tactics) and Loragorn combo is also much better.

Deal...I'll try to throw up mine tomorrow evening.  It is funny you mention "bad twin deck," because I have tried a loragorn and twins deck several times and never gotten it quite right and was thinking that (with the readying abilities) this could turn out kinda similar.....we'll see.

So I finally made it to the third quest of the box and pretty much rolled it.  I think I had a pretty good opening hand and my decks are sort of set up well against it, but maybe it's not so bad.  That's only one game though. The last few turns against the boss were funny.  He can't take damage while another orc is in play and I initially had three others engaged and ended up drawing two more as I whittled them down.  Because Aragorn had Steward and Stone in play and because of Kahliel's ability I was able to play ally Glorfindel 5 turns in a row, have him defend against the boss hit, die, and then come right back the next turn.

 

Taking out the Gondorian Shield and putting in a play set of Warnings was a good move.

Obviously any quest is deck and player number dependent, but #3 feels a bit easier than #1 to me.  I can see that multiplayer it could be much harder.

 

I need to go back and try #1 with this updated version though.

Just a general observation on the box/cycle: I must say I find the desert and even Harad theme a bit underplayed, particularly on the enemies. The Umbar and the desert quest are cool, but the fact that we got yet another quest where the enemies are orcs is a bit disappointing. We se them everywhere, and I'm tired of them. They seem like an easy solution, and that's why the Grey Havens/Dream-chaser cycle felt so refreshing to me. I know the third quest is about the reach of Sauron's evil to Harad, but why not instead of orcs have another evil Haradrim kingdom that got already corrupted by Sauron (and we know there were likely many) attack the village? Or maybe even a tribe of "Half-trolls of Far Harad" as they call them in the books, depicted as some kind of desert savages mercenaries of Sauron? I don't know, I just think there are more creative enemies we could have had instead of orcs (and spiders in the third AP). And also we know the second AP will have orcs on wargs as the main enemies. That seems super boring and out of place for the Harad cycle.

It's not just the enemies that seem to be old but also some of the mechanics. For example, we have had encounter cards that remove progress from the quest since the core set. Overall, there does not seem to be too much novelty here. I think I'd rather skip this deluxe and cycle.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to be all that negative. I mean, I'm still going to buy everything like a madman, it's just that I think there could have been more interesting enemy choices. However I'm very excited for the Black Serpent as we'll be fighting a Haradrim warlord, so that's cool. I wish though that we will go eventually to one of the Haradrim's capitals or a guarded castle. We never got that with the Dunlendings sadly, and I hope we don't just encounter them in ruins or the desert. I'd like it if they explored their big settlements. The village in the third quest looks cool though.

I'm going to argue that there are three new mechanics in the Harad box:

 

1.  Temperature.  It is used both as a combo Threat/Timed mechanic and as a way to scale the power of enemies.  (I think they are really saying that the party is weakening.)  You can't spin that counter backwards and the speed at which it increases does give a sense of desperation.

 

2.  Objective Heroes.

 

3.  Mounts for enemies.

 

(And I LIKE killing orcs.)

I was hoping that my comment would spark responses like yours, Bullroarer. Looking forward to read more of them. :-)

 

Regarding your points:

 1. How is temperature really different from lowering your maximum threat as in Trouble in Tharbad?

 2. Do objective-hero cards feel that much different from the occasional objective-ally card we have seen before?

 3. Well, yeah, the idea is cool but really not that different from previous enemy attachments (e.g. for the Nazguls), is it?

Don't get me wrong I totally get where you are coming from and understand but I feel completely different.

The feel of the encounter cards in this deluxe (especially the locations and treacheries) is very different from what we normally receive especially the art. We see all sorts of interesting new effects such as the temperature and objective hero mechanics, willpower of defenders now mattering in certain quests which is a cool alternative to making them actually defend using their willpower like in the stone of erech, we see enemy mounts that become their own enemy once the rider is defeated, locations that discard the top card of the encounter deck and only add it to staging depending if its an enemy or location, we even get an enemy that you cannot declare defenders against which is something really neat and new. 

I see where you are coming from in regards to the Orcs but I mean in the end they are ultimately Sauron's main type of warrior and follower. He literally has legions and legions of Orcs but somewhat limited amounts of any other fighter. Even during The War of the Ring he may have Haradrim and Umbar armies fighting for him but they are vastly outnumbered by the legions of Orcs he had. Harad is also pretty close to Mordor so it makes sense that it would be crawling with orcs and various servants or spies of the Dark Lord. I do agree it would have been great to see the "half-trolls" of Far Harad or something similar. 

I feel like orcs definitely aren't "out of place" in this cycle considering its proximity to Mordor and the fact the vast majority of Sauron's forces were in fact orcs/goblins/uruks. I do totally agree that it would be nice to see some other new enemies and I hope that we do in fact see some in the last few AP's. We haven't seen spiders in forever either so as much as yes we have seen lots of them in the past we haven't seen them in a while so it is still something different from the last few cycles (no spiders since the first cycle and second cycles if you don't include Saga quests).

We saw spiders in Heirs too, and a very scary one at that.

 

I understand that some people do like orcs a lot so this makes them happy I guess. It's a matter of taste. I never said that orcs in Harad was far-fetched or unlikely (when saying wargs are out of place I meant that in a more artisitc sense, I mean sure, wargs in the desert are possible, but that's not want I want to see when I go to the desert). The scenarios presented here are not breaking the lore in any way, BUT, this is still a game and a piece of art where the creators are expected to innovate and, you know, be artistic; go where they haven't gone before, like they did with the corsairs and dunlendings. If we're going to have possibly the most exotic expansion in this game ever, with African-style bomas and Arabic hamadas and wadis, I would have preferred an equally exotic choice of enemies in this third quest, again, Half Trolls or Haradrim instead of orcs on wargs, even if both make sense thematically. It's just about going for the new stuff when presented with the occasion.

 

I do aknowledge though the creativity in the other 2 quests and the mechanics of the third quest with the heroes in the staging area and all that.

I haven't actually received and played the deluxe box yet so what I have to say is purely based off the spoilers and not experience. 

1) well it seems like you can't lower temperature in any way whatsoever and if it gets to a certain level you lose so that is pretty different from threat which can be lowered or raised. If anything it is more of a strict timer (that cannot be reduced) and if anything I would say it is far more similar to time counters than it is to threat. 

 

2) I would imagine that the Objective heroes also generate resources? Could be wrong here as again I dont have the box yet im just going off spoilers but I imagine they generate resources and can pay for neutral cards (or maybe even cards of any sphere?). It seems as though you start the third quest off with all your heroes captured and with only an objective hero under your control so surely they generate resources? I guess they aren't THAT different from objective allies but they do have some really cool abilities and art so to me they are definitely different enough to be interesting and exciting.

 

3) it isnt THAT different but at the same time it does operate in a very different manner to "nazgul" or "condition" attachments that enemies can receive in a few ways. First off if there are no nazgul in play the nazgul attachments simply whiff, this card will still enter play as its own enemy if there are no orcs in play. Once you destroy a nazgul the attachments are discarded as well, if you destroy the attached orc enemy the warg becomes its own foe that you still have to deal with. Its the same concept (enemy attachments/mounts) but done in a very different and new way. I for one think the design on this card is absolutely incredible and I cannot wait to see what its like during actual gameplay.

I never said that orcs in Harad was far-fetched or unlikely (when saying wargs are out of place I meant that in a more artisitc sense, I mean sure, wargs in the desert are possible, but that's not want I want to see when I go to the desert). The scenarios presented here are not breaking the lore in any way, BUT, this is still a game and a piece of art where the creators are expected to innovate and, you know, be artistic; go where they haven't gone before, like they did with the corsairs and dunlendings. If we're going to have possibly the most exotic expansion in this game ever, with African-style bomas and Arabic hamadas and wadis, I would have preferred an equally exotic choice of enemies in this third quest, again, Half Trolls or Haradrim instead of orcs on wargs, even if both make sense thematically. It's just about going for the new stuff when presented with the occasion.

yeah fair enough re orc enemies and sorry for somewhat misunderstanding you, they definitely could have been more creative and given us some other form of enemy. Hell they could have had both Orcs AND half trolls.

1. Temperature is different in two ways. So far there is no way to spin the dial backwards AND there are enemies whose strength increases as the Mercury rises.

2. Not too much except that they do generate resources.

3. Psycho covered this one.

I might have added one more mechanic which I forgot. There are enemies that get stronger as we get farther into the quest. "X equals the quest stage."

Speaking more generally now, I'm not a big fan of the undead. (Not sure why honestly.) and I was getting kinda tired of pirates too. Smashing orcs feels right.

There are some spoilers over at CGDB that clarify some of the above points. Objective heroes collect neutral resources apparently and the quest cards state that the first card played each phase does not require a resource match.

 

Psychorocka, no worries at all. I'm still hyped as heck for this box and the subsequent cycle. I also do hold some hope we will see Half Trolls eventually, hopefully as the main enemy of an AP, or maybe even just one or two like the were-wolves, though I would like if there were many more. I'm also extremely hyped for a Harad trait deck in particular.

YES! Not that big a fan of undead in this game either (love the art and theme but not actually fighting them during gameplay) and as much as I loved crushing Pirate scum I am a bit sick of Corsairs as well. It will be nice to get back to taking out scores of nasty orcs.

For me the 3rd quest was the hardest. The first quest, you have to quest like mad.

I played a deck with the new Gimli and Legolas, paired with Haldir.

I don't think I ever played Raid solo, but Deadman's Dyke is probably harder.

## 286 [Seastan on December 3, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/224887-the-sands-of-harad/?do=findComment&comment=2524891)

Just went through the box in solo with Beravor/Gimli/Legolas (link [http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/3777/legimlivor-1.0]). Overall, I thought it was fantastic and I give the box a 5/5. The player cards are interesting and fun to use, but not overpowered. I thoroughly enjoyed every quest, and even though I just went through them I find myself wanting to play each of them again. I think part of that is due to the existence of the side quests which can give you a unique experience depending on which ones show up (Southron Champion came up for me, and I loved taking that guy down).

 

Spoilers:

 

For all the quests, I thought they really nailed the theme. I felt like I was being chased, then dying of thirst, then overrun with orcs. I think the effects on the final boss, the Uruk Chieftian, is quite brilliant. It definitely feels like some boss is sending his underlings ahead of him to weaken you before dealing with you himself. I think the designers are getting much smarter with their boss battles lately (Sahir from City of Corsairs was another mechanic I liked) to make the fights challenging, while not simply stacking the boss with a million hit points and making him immune to everything.

 

For the Long arm of Mordor - I think this is the best "captured" mechanic they've come up with so far. I didn't feel utterly crippled with a useless hand from the get-go. I think this is thanks to the "no resource match required for the first card played" effect.

 

 

> I would really like to hear other players opinions on this. For me, playing solo, the first quest is the hardest by far.

 

Actually, the first quest was my only loss, and it was on turn 1 because I flipped up something with high threat and didn't make any progress despite questing with everyone. In terms of difficulty, I thought all the quests were pretty even. Some could be easier or harder depending on your deck type. Bringing a major turtle deck to Escape from Umbar wouldn't go over well, while I could see a high willpower deck cruising through it more easily.

Tried the first quest today with decks I had lying about from the dream chaser cycle, eowyn/glorfindel and a ranger trap deck (2 handed) and lost after quite a struggle.

Built a rough version of Aragorn, gimli, legolas (leadership/leadership/spirit) and beat it after some tense moments, but got gimli and Aragorn kiled in the last two rounds. Dunedain remedy really helped with the archery damage.

Greatly enjoyed the box. Quick thoughts:

 

Escape from Umbar: Managed to win this quest on the first try, but suspect this is the most difficult in the box.

Desert Crossing: Thought it was one of the more successful wilderness travel quests in the game.

Long Arm of Mordor: Most difficult of the three quests for me personally, but probably not as hard as Escape from Umbar. Agree with Seastan's assessment that it's the best of the the three prisoner quests (Escape from Dol Guldor, Escape from Mount Gram), particularly because it doesn't totally hamstring the player(s). I thought Mount Gram was also a solid prisoner quest, but this quest is not nearly as finicky to set up. I also found the rescuing mechanic to be well-executed. It's challenging to deal with, but simple to understand. The "first card played each phase does not require a resource match" was also well done, as it provides the players options despite missing their heroes. Also really liked the Objective heroes. They definitely felt more interesting to use than Objective allies.

 

I thought the box did a solid job of providing us three engaging quests without a lot of overhead to manage. The busiest quest to me was the first, as a large amount of enemies can make it onto the board. The other two were pretty easy to work with from a board management/clutter standpoint. Additionally, I enjoyed the encounter side quests because there were fewer of them and they were not nearly as brutal as the Lost Realm cycle. To me, that provided for more variable and interesting game play. While I liked the Lost Realm encounter side quests, I thought many of them were so overwhelming as to be mandatory. Finally, I enjoyed the story presented in the quests and the rules insert, particularly as it fed into the final quest and its conclusion. I am definitely excited to play the first AP!

Played through the box today, first quest 3 player and the next two quests 4 player.  Won the first two quests on the first try, but I thoroughly enjoyed them and it was a tough fight.  The progress mechanic on the first quest was a lot of fun, and the temperature mechanic is a slick way to ramp difficulty and apply a time pressure.

 

The third quest though, Long Arm of Mordor... I don't think it works in 4 player.  Maaaaybe if you all build decks specifically for that quest.  First game, first turn we quested with every character except for the ranged and sentinel heroes and were short by 7 willpower.  Second turn, same thing and we were short by 10 willpower.  Gandalf/Elrond guy threats out.  

 

Reset the quest. Play maximum willpower and quest with everyone first turn.  Short by 7 willpower, then the 7 enemies wreck us.  GG on turn 1 and it's not even close.  I haven't had such an unsatisfying pair of games since Battle of Carn Dum.  I like the concept of the quest, but will probably never play it 4 player again.  I imagine 1 or 2 player is much more manageable.

Did you happen to get hit by Savage Attack in both games? I can see that card being tough in 4 player.

 

Otherwise, I did a little math and the average amount of threat you'll turn up in that quest in 4 cards (including surge) is around 7-8. Add that to the initial 4 threat in the staging area and you should expect 11-12 on turn 1. The objective heroes start with 8, so you probably need to play 6+ willpower of allies down on turn 1 to be comfortable. I think a good strategy then is to have three players load up on 2 cost/2 WP allies that they can play turn 1. The fourth player goes with a secrecy lore deck running Risk Some Light and Out of the Wild/Door is Closed to get rid of the Savage Attacks, as well as some healing.

After a couple of games against the first quest with Aragorn/Legolas/Gimli, both narrow wins, I tried the Desert Crossing. Survived the first two stages, but was too weak to fight off the creature in the final stage. This is definitely the "you'd better be packing healing" box. Lore is my least-played sphere, so this cycle looks like time to address that.

>  

We did get one savage attack, but had a Test of Will.  Both games we drew a Jungle Trail and its 4 threat.  I know we had a Fear of Mordor that basically negated all of our allies.  Then pretty much every other card is 2+ threat, and an overgrown or 2 added even more threat.  One Jungle Trail negates the excess willpower of the heroes, so then you are counting entirely on the allies.  Maybe if everyone plays a 2 WP ally and you get a lucky draw you could make progress on turn 1, but then you are going to get wrecked by the enemies.  We certainly didn't have a lot of willpower from our allies.  I was playing a combat deck, so had no willpower.  I think the other decks had a combined ~4 WP of allies, which meant we had almost no chance.

 

I suspect the quest could be beaten if we had prepared specifically for it, but that is very difficult to coordinate in 4 player.  We certainly didn't have the best decks to go against it.  I think this quest falls into a category with quests like Journey to Rhosgobel where a lot of standard decks just don't work.

You caught the part in the rules about undefended attacks going on heroes in the staging area right? When I played solo I just quested with everyone for the first few rounds and just ignored those 1-attack enemies.

I do see why this would be harder in multiplayer, but it is a difficulty 7, which to me means you shouldn't be able to bring 4 uncoordinated decks against it.

## 297 [Teamjimby on December 4, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/224887-the-sands-of-harad/?do=findComment&comment=2526083)

Yeah, I knew about the undefended attacks thing.  The problem is when you get 3 and 4 attack enemies and all of your characters are questing.

 

It's just a hard quest that doesn't work too well with 4 players.  It's not the first and it won't be the last.

Played the first two quests. The first is pretty tough but I manged to beat it first attempt. Tactics Legolas being able to place progress at key moments was ridiculously helpful in this quest as he allowed me to remove progress to avoid nasty enemy effects then replace that progress by Legolas taking said foe out. The second quest is **** tough for slower decks! I actually lost this one twice by "heating out" (as opposed to threating out :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] ) and then won the third attempt on a whopping 58 on the heat level....

Haven't played the third quest yet but excited as it seems like the most fun with the objective heroes, cool quest stage design of rescuing heroes one at a time and the cool boss and uruk swarm showdown at the end.

Loving the new deluxe box thus far! Two really great quests that I can see myself replaying for sure. Glad I finally have a real copies (as opposed to proxies) of Gimli and Unlikely Friendship. Still trying to decide if I will remove anything from my decks to put in a few copies of the new leadership ally.

I finally beat the second quest yesterday, after upping the number of healing cards in the trap deck (playing 2 handed ranger traps and three hunters). Heat was at 56 on the final round.

Was slowed down mid game by the side quest that prevents heroes readying from player card effects - not ideal when using Leadership Aragorn, Gimli and Spirit Legolas.
