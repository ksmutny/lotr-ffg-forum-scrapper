In 11 days we will have FotW Saga at GenCon. Since its announcement article, I've been particularly interested in its first quest, The Passage of the Grey Company, with its Overcome by Fear Objective which attaches to our threat dials and the Phantom Keyword, which assigns enemy attacks damage as threat raise. I decided to make some fanmade encounter cards for that quest, just for fun. The @ means it's unique.

ENEMIES:

@The Dead's Lord:

50ec 4t 7a 4d 10hp Phantom. Inmune to effects of cards of players who are Overcome by Fear.

Restless Spirit:

26ec 2t 4a 2d 3hp Phantom. Peril. When revealed: either attach aset aside Overcome by Fear to your threat dial, or Restless Spirit makes an inmediate attack against you. Shadow: if the defending player is Overcome by Fear, add Restless Spirit to the Staging Area.

Ghost Captain:

34ec 3t 4a 4d 5hp Phantom. Forced: after Ghost Captain engages a player, each Oathbreaker enemy gets +1 attack and -10 engagement cost until the end of the round(+2 attack and -20 engagement cost if that player is Overcome by Fear).

LOCATIONS:

@The Door*:

4t 4qp Inmune to player card effects. Forced: After The Door is explored, each player raises his threat by 4. The first player may spend X Fellowship resources to reduce that amount by X.

@Great Cave:

5t 5qp Inmune to player card effects. Travel: each player searches the encounter deck and discard pile for an Oathbreaker enemy and adds it to the staging area. Forced: after Great Cave is explored, each player who is Overcome by Fear searches the Encounter Deck and Discard Pile for an Oathbreaker enemy, reveals it, and puts it in play engaged with him.

@Stone of Erech:

6t 6qp Inmune to player card effects. The Dead's lord cannot take damage. Forced: after Stone of Erech becomes the active location, each player must attach a set aside Overcome by Fear to its threat dial, or raise its threat by 5.**

TREACHERIES:

We Serve no Lord!:

Doomed 3. When revealed: each engaged enemy makes an inmediate attack. The first player may spend X Fellowship resources to force enemies engaged with X players of his choice to ignore this effect.***

Spirits Everywhere:

Peril. When revealed: search the encounter deck and discard pile for an enemy and put it in play engaged with you. If you are Overcome by Fear, Spirits Everywhere gains Surge. Shadow: put the topmost enemy in the enounter discard pile engaged with you.****

Taken by Terror: Doomed 1. Surge. Shadow: either let the first player pay 1 Fellowship resource, or attach a set aside Overcome by Fear to you threat dial.

*This starts active.

**Note that it doesn't say "either", so it reads like: "each player who is Overcome by Fear raises his threat by 5. Each player who isn't must attach a set aside Overcome by Fear to their threat dial".

***Yes, no shadow card. I'm too lazy for that.

****This one is a bit vague but I believe you got me.
