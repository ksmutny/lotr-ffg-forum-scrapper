I just wanted to alert everyone that the release date estimates for the first three packs of against the shadow, have been pushed back to Quarter 2. I know that it makes sense to have about three months in between each of these large expansions, because each has three scenarios in it, but it still feels like a long time!

****. Maybe they're trying to prevent competing with their own hobbit expansion? Hopefully we'll get that soon to hold us over until second quarter… which is really a month and a half away.

I suppose March would've been too soon since we are well into Feb and hasn't seen the second Hobbit Box yet.

If On the Doorstep comes out before 15th and the Against the Shadow cycle starts releasing first week of April it's still good enough for me.
