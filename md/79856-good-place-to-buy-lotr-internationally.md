Anyone knows a place with a low cost international shipping? I live in Russia and I couldn't find a place that sells LotR here - tried a few place but no luck. Bookdepository has some expansions but when I ordered Khazad Dum and a couple of adventure packs - they totally screwed me over sending me the small packs but cancelling on the Khazad Dum … I tried ebay - where I got I don't want to spend more money on shipping than I do on an actual game!

I use http://www.bookdepository.co.uk/ [http://www.bookdepository.co.uk/]

 

They ship free to many countries…

 

And got all my shippings without problem…

 

Khazadum is an expansion they don't have much

I ordered from them - Khazad-dum and couple of adventure packs from that cycle - they charged me, but than they refunded me for the big expansion box and onlu sent out the small ones.. Which I cannot even use without khazad-dum.. Other than that they are great, lol. Is this box in limited supply or something? Almost no outlet that ships internationally has one, it's just sad…
