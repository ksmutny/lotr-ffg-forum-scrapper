Im looking for a little clarification on exactly how his ranged attack and response work. For example if I use Denethor to defend an enemy Im engaged with, then my son can use legolas on his attack turn to kill that enemy and trigger his respone? Another example Denethor could defend then his legolas could add his attack power to my Aragorn and kill the enemy and trigger his response?

 

Thanks,

Yes, both of those work exactly as you say. The Ranged keyword allows Legolas to participate in attacks against enemies engaged with other players, and his response can be triggered any time he participates in an attack which destroys an enemy, wherever that enemy happens to be and however much help he is or isn't getting on the attack.

Correct. "Ranged" has 2 parts: it allows you to attack enemies you are not engaged with, alone and/or with another players attack.

Ex1: Spider engages P1. P1 defends with Aragorn, and has no heroes left to attack. P2 has no engaged enemies so he exhausts Legolas and declares an attack on spider, kills it and immediately places progress tokiens on the current quest.

Ex2: Spider engages P1. P1 defends with Aragorn. Orc engages p2. P2 defends with Gimli. P1 declares Glorfindel and exhausts him to attack against the spider. P2 declares Legolas will attack with Glorfindel, they kill said spider and immediately put progress on the quest. BONUS! P2 exhausts Unexpected Courage, readies Legolas, exhausts him to attack the Orc, kills the Orc and puts even more progress on the quest.

Ranged pretty much means Legolas is on your side of the table when you are attacking.

Just as a note, to be sure no future mistakes will be made when playing... "Ranged" does not allow to attack enemies in the staging area. (There are specific ways to do so, but these are mentiuoned on the cards) It only allows to attack an enemy which is enganged with "someone".

Thanks for the replies. One last question then if player 1 is engaged with an enemy and Aragorn + Glorfindel have the attack power to kill the enemy can player 2s Legolas still join in and trigger the response even though his added power is not needed or does player 1 need to decline to attack and let it pass to player 2s attack turn and allow Legolas to attack?

Legolas can still participate, there's no problem with overkill :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Truth. Sorry if that caused confusion. I was trying to state it in a global way, but different from the rule book.
