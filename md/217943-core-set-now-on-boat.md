Fingers crossed it doesn't get sunk by Eru like the first boat Flight of the Stormcaller was on!

Eru created the world but is standing outside of it without involving himself.

 

The Vala Ulmo would be a more suitable suspect in this instance ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

Whilst true he has directly intervened on several occasions.

He specifically sank Numenor himself for example

Fingers crossed it doesn´t get sunk by Eru or any valar (or Osse).

Though Ulmo is more prone to temper, creating storms in that process. Eru´s influence is of a more deliberate nature and should he be the cause then the boat must have ferried some sort of cargo, as to upset the natural order of things.

 

My money is still on Ulmo. Though, as mentioned, Ossë might have played a part depending on how close to the shore-line the boat in question was.
