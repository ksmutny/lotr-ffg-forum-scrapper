I kinda believe that the new song (giving the Lore icon) may find more use than the Song of Kings (giving the Leadership icon). I am looking forward to trying and including this in a Lore Leadship deck attaching the Song of Wisdom to Glóin.

Well, I see this is not much of a thread but ideas and comments are still welcome. How about the other new cards? I think the Dúnedain Warning may be even better than the Mark, and that one is already great. It really depends on the scenario and deck but I though the defensive mechanisms will be harder to get. I find the two Dúnedain Signals very powerful.

Finally, I also much like the Map-Maker, again, in my Lore Leadership deck, it calls to be strong.

I don't know if it will be more frequently used. I used the Song of Kings to get the Stward of Gondor in decks without leadership.

Song of Wisdom is a great way to include some healing powers in sologames for me. Yesterday I tried a Tactics/Spirit Deck agasint the Anduin-Scenario and 1-2 Daughters of the Nimrodel would have been great.

I agree, I find that healing is the thing I miss most when I'm not using Lore.  Last night I was trying to make the perfect deck to beat Hunt for Gollum solo. I had Eowyn and Dunhere but I wanted to also use Theodred but then I also really wanted to use the Lore threat cancelling cards and Strider's Path. I was torn and wished I had Song of Wisdom to help me out, I had more Leadership cards than Lore cards I wanted to use in the deck. In the end I used Bilbo instead with Song of Kings which ended up working out to score 10 on HfG!

I'm sure Song of Wisdom will come in handy with the Carrock scenario. It seems like a Tactics/Spirit deck (with Frodo) might be really great but then I'd also want some of that sweet healing action.
