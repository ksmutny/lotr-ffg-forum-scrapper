Do you think I played this right/fairly?

 

 

Hi, I am playing the core game, I have the Ally Henamarth Riversong (Ally.Silvan.Lore) drawn and on the table. He allows me to reveal the top card of the encounter deck during the player actions part of any phase. Its been going awesome with him up until this point..

 

I use him to reveal the top card of the encounter deck in the "players actions" of the 1st phase which then allows me to determine what I will do in the next phases because I know whats coming by at least one encounter card before I have to draw it in the "quest/staging" phase. 

 

What is funny is I finally drew a treachery card "The necromancers reach" which causes 1 point of damage to any exhausted card "when revealed". At this point Henamarth Riversong is the only exhausted card so he dies immediately. My thoughts are I should discard the treachery card... but the purpose of the scouting card is to let me know what is coming but now I have the immediate effect of "when revealed" from the treachery card so I have to apply the effect right away and because of that I must discard the treachery card but now when the "quest/staging phase" comes I must also draw a new encounter card during the same round. 

 

I am using the core Lore and Leadership Decks with Aragorn-Lore, Theodred and Gloin-Leadership. Thanks!

if i understand this correctly you are saying when you 'peek' with riversong you are 'revealing' the card?

 

if so this is incorrect, as the cards says 'look' so all that happens is that it goes back on unresolved

 

hope this helps

Rich is correct. And because of NR's when revealed effect you did good to use Henamarth after the quest phase.
