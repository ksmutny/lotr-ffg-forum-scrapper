Just like to check my understanding of something please.

 

If a card with victory points is killed/explored/etc by my party, I put it to one side next to the threat tracker (as per rulebook) and thus (this is the main bit) if the encounter deck needs a reshuffle later (eg when empty and at correct phase), these are not in the discard pile and so do not get shuffled back into the deck at that stage, so you only need to beat em once.

 

My further understanding is that if a card with victory points gets discarded for other means (Eg shadow card) then it DOES go into the discard pile and WOULD get shuffled back in if the encounter deck needed resetting due to being empty.

 

This right??

 

Thanks

Correct on all accounts!  Except for one.  Don't put those things next to the threat tracker.  You have to nail them to the wall.

When you do this it scares the other enemies so much that their engagement cost is set to 51.
