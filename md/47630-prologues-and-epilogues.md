What happens when you complete a scenario?

Well, there are currently no cards to cover this eventuality and 'close the story' if you will.  To that end I designed cards that fill in the gaps between adventures.  I've only completed the prologues and epilogues for my own scenarios, but I might try tackling the official ones soon too.

You can't copy and paste into these forums so I'll leave the link to the original post for those who are interested:

Enjoy!

I am not sure but i think reason they didn't gave us quest cards like those it is because wen you finish one scenario is like to be cintinued and not like this story has ended try to play the next story.My English sucks so i may be totaly wrong.

Anyway great work mate and if this art is yours you have a fanlengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif].

Great idea. Maybe FFg should pick up the idea, and release such cards as promo cards...

would love to see a min-expansion with these card plus 1x each of the 13 player deck cards that are only 1x in the core set.

It's never going to happen though :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

That would be awesome - in fact, if they did that I'd maybe even buy a second core set...  But - as you say - never gonne happen. :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]
