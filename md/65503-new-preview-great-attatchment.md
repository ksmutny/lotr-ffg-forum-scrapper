Will Healing Herbs turn Rhosgobel more soloable?

## 3 [Budgernaut on June 4, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65503-new-preview-great-attatchment/?do=findComment&comment=640140)

They are indeed an interesting set of cards.

Healing Herbs is interesting. I think my playing style would probably be conducive to using it. And since a lot of Lore allies are 3+ for cost, it would be a great replacement for Lore of Imladris. I, too, wonder how Healing Herbs will work in Rhosgobel.

Durin's Axe is great. I have no complaints about it. I think it's interesting that many objectives are guarded, causing another encounter card to be placed in the staging area, but this one has surge instead. I think that's a good move because it wouldn't make sense for this to be guarded. What do orcs care about this axe?

Path of Need is probably the most controversial card from this pack. I'm really interested to see how it plays. It certainly will take some strategy to use. If you don't have to exhaust to quest while it is attached to the active location, it could be really easy to over-commit and remove the location from the staging area, meaning you won't get the benefit of attacking/defending for free. Then again, you would get to attack/defend in the round in which you traveled to the location Path of Need was attached to, assuming you played it on a location in the staging area rather than directly on the active location. I think it's very interesting that they've limited it to one per deck. It'll be a lot harder to find it in your deck with only one copy. You know, this would be a great card to put on The Carrock in Conflict at the Carrock. Then you just make sure you have 4 allies to die and enough combined attack with your heroes to fell a troll. You don't need to keep your threat low because you could just knock each one out in the round they engage you. EDIT: Better yet, if all three heroes have a Tactics icon, you just let the trolls engage and use Thicket of Spears to prevent their attacks.

Path of Need on Durins Door …

^^^^^^ yes……let me think about that for a moment- very interesting indeed

## 6 [Mattr0polis on June 4, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65503-new-preview-great-attatchment/?do=findComment&comment=640154)

Path of Need could be crazy. Yeah you can only run 1 per deck but you could build a Leadership/Lore deck with drawing tricks and Word of Command x3 to get it quickly and then use the Erebor Hammersmiths x3 like they mention and also Second Breakfast x3 to keep getting it played a ton.

And if you play multiplayer, both the Hammersmith and Second Breakfast are worded so that your friends could run copies of those to help you keep getting it back as well as run their own Path of Need.

## 7 [lleimmoen on June 4, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65503-new-preview-great-attatchment/?do=findComment&comment=640160)

Ok, first I wonder whether the pack will only have one copy of Path of Need or still three? Then while it is a very strong card, is it really that much more powerful than Grim Resolve. The answer is probably yes, it is more powerful, heroes can do whatever while it is activated but to trigger its effect is certainly more complicated. You play it as an attachment so you shall have the location active by the time you go questing and then it will be gone if you quest well enough, if you don't quest well enough, what's the point of playing it? Battle! I am sure it will find its uses - new combos will likely show up soon but for now I am not really psyched about it. In fact I see no reason of the deck restriction to a single copy but time may prove me fool.

Neither do I think the herbs too good. I find Warden of Healing a much stronger card. In my games I more often than not have the damage spread around the table rather than concentrated on a single character. But again, instances, Gloin, Wilyador, Gollum's Bite, etc.

ps: Cannot wait for the hero preview next week.

 Path of Need would have made a good secrecy card. And I hate when they give you three copies when you can only use one.

Absolutely! I didn't even think of that. If you've only got 2 heroes, you need them to do more than in a standard deck, and giving it a secrecy card would have made it more accessible to those decks. I suppose it only takes 2 rounds of Steward of Gondor to get enough resources for this card, and if both your heroes are Leadership and SoG is on the table, you should be able to buy this in a single round. But still, secrecy would have been nice.

## 10 [Captain Poe on June 4, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65503-new-preview-great-attatchment/?do=findComment&comment=640193)

Remember, lots of solo players use multi-decks… so it is possible to get use out of multiple copies of a 1-per-deck card.

I'm thinking it's probably best used in a lore/leader deck, where you can pull a Word of Command

does this not give dale scout a whole new meaning? just keep moving tokens off the location

Interesting.

And I have also thought of Word of Command - if you can really make most out of the card and you can only have one in a deck, you better draw it early and recycle it with Erebor Hammersmith. That ally is really something, his stats already make him a good addition to almost any Lore deck but his ability has grown considerably since the core set, Ancient Mathom, Good Meal, now this.

## 13 [richsabre on June 4, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65503-new-preview-great-attatchment/?do=findComment&comment=640233)

yes this card is very 'combo' friendly - it really boosts dale scouts worth i think and yes also hammersmith (though he didnt need it)

## 14 [Mattr0polis on June 4, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65503-new-preview-great-attatchment/?do=findComment&comment=640262)

The Ravenhill Scout idea is cool, Rich. Only problem though is that no progress really gets to the quest cards. But there's still some merit in that for certain quests or to clear the staging area easily for a turn or two.

I was more thinking Strider's Path x3. Cause then you attach Path of Need to the active location, quest everyone without exhausting, switch a newly flipped location to the active with Strider's Path, get a ton of progress cause of everyone questing which completely explores the switched-to location and a bunch more progress on the quest, and then Travel phase go back to the Path of Need location for non-exhausting battle/defendings.

There's also some Encounter deck cards that help us out in certain quests, like Impassable Chasm or something I think in Emyn Muil? It's when revealed pushes out any active location. Perfect for Path of Need lol.

I wish Sneak Attacking West Road Travellers worked as well, but alas it doesn't. :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

I don't think that would work. If you switch out the location that has Path of Need attached then it would seem that no one is committed to the quest. In order for Path of Need to activate it needs to be attached to the "active location". By removing the active location Path of Need no longer applies. If my thinking is correct the quest phase could be disastorous…no progress would be put on the location you swapped or the quest because no progress would be gained. However, you would have all your characters ready to defend and/or attack.

## 16 [Mattr0polis on June 4, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65503-new-preview-great-attatchment/?do=findComment&comment=640287)

No.

Path of Need just makes them not exhaust to commit. You are well past the committing characters step when you would play Strider's Path and knock out the active location and Path of Need. You can't be knocked out of being committed to the quest unless a card specifically does that or the character dies.

It's like Aragorn still being committed to the quest even if you use his response ability to immediately ready him.

Mattr0polis is correct in his ruling.  For the moment, Strider's Path seems to be the best combo with this card.

yeah great.. the designers of this game are just loosing it.. they need to get there **** together.

Northern Tracker… arguably one of the most powerful cards in the game is hated by many players as it nearly completely negates an entire sub phase of the game. .the travel phase.. when you have trackers out you just never travel.. completely removing an entire decision form the player and making the game a ton easier.. and now we have a card that again tries to completely remove the travel phase as well as making it re-donk-ulasly easy to attack and quest.. as if that wasn't easy enough after a few turns..

So we have a card that like tracker but even worse. removes an entire game play element, we also remove tons of decision making processes on who to tap when and why and those decisions are almost ALL the decisions you make each turn.. so the game  will basically play itself after this card is out and you just watch.… this is even worse than the Ziggy card for completely wrecking the game play…

Seriously.. WTF are they thinking.

Even better, my friend (username: The Janitor on here) reminded me of some of those Hobbit card previews. If you go to the Hobbit description page and scroll down a bit, you can make out a card called Thror's Map. We're not positive but it looks like Thror's Map is an attachment that can exhaust every turn to change the active location. Here's a link to it:

javascript:void(0);/*1338864402640*/ [http://fantasyflightgames.com/edge_npm_sec.asp?eidm=136&esem=1]

If that's true it's gonna be CRAZY with Path of Need once it's out!

Umm, What?  First off, why would you not travel just because Northern Tracker is out?  Do you seriously think it is better to have two or three threat sitting in the staging area for three or four turns then to just jet it out of the way in one turn? Tracker is a great suppliment if you are getting buried by locations, but is no competition with clearing one in a single turn.

And Path of Need had absolutely no impact on the travel phase.  While it does give you a turn or two of great power, unless you build your deck around it it really isn't much worse then Grim Resolve or Lure of Moria.  And if you do build around it, it has the same weakness as Zigil Miner.  If you don't see it, how much use can you get out of the cards you included to enhance it? And to make it even harder to pull off, you only have a single copy to dig for.

 

Personally, I love it.  Yet another card that provides a different approach to deck building.

## 23 [lleimmoen on June 5, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65503-new-preview-great-attatchment/?do=findComment&comment=640431)

Strider's Path is a good one.

Or this, you attach it to a location in the staging area, its effect doesn't trigger because it isn't active so you still have to exhaust for questing - it doesn't affect allies anyways, so you want to get most out of those. You then travel to it after you make progress. Then you're set for Combat and the Quest phase next round - so you can still get benefit from all three things, defence, attack, quest.

because the vast number of locations have a negative effect when you travel to them..

i would agree on that mattr0polis- it certainly looks like thrors map does that

## 26 [lleimmoen on June 5, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65503-new-preview-great-attatchment/?do=findComment&comment=640479)

Ok, so you need location A and B, Path of Need, Thor's Map. Play Path of Need on location A, commit characters to the quest, exhaust Thor's Map to make location B active, run through it and make progress, travel to location A. Sounds like a nice combo, and there's not long till it be available.

Bottom line, with Henamarth (to scout what's coming), Hammersmith, Scout, Strider's Path, Thor's Map and Word of Command, Lore looks like an obvious sphere for the deck with Path of Need.

I cannot answer since I have only played MtG some half-life ago and the LotR tcg for about a month (of boredom). However, I do agree, the player cards from this cycle seem much more potent than those of the previous cycle, even though I would still call many of those from the core set among the very best.

I think we should have a new poll after this cycle is over before the Hobbit saga takes us for a new ride.

## 29 [richsabre on June 5, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65503-new-preview-great-attatchment/?do=findComment&comment=640494)

i agree- last poll most were core set cards- id say it would be about 75/25 core/dwarrowdelf cards now

## 30 [Thorongil on June 5, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65503-new-preview-great-attatchment/?do=findComment&comment=640508)

Path of Need definitely looks like a potent card, but if you have only one copy in a deck, it seems rather foolish to try to build an entire strategy around it. If you can make good use of Strider's Path, anyway (and why not?), then go ahead and work it into a combo. That's good stuff. Otherwise, with my luck, I'd be worried that Path of Need would be at the bottom of my deck. Sure, I can draw there, but will I draw there before it's too late to get the boost?

Meanwhile, I have to agree that the Dwarrowdelf cards are more powerful on the whole than the Mirkwood cards, but the power of cards isn't an even field. It's a spiky chart, and there are definitely some powerful cards from the Shadows of Mirkwood. Boromir, anyone? Still, until they make another card that deals with Treachery effects, A Test of Will is hands-down the strongest card in the game. I'm not a fan of Sleeping Sentry. I think it creates a "false" gaming experience. If the encounter deck is meant to "play" against us, then it should start getting the edge and push an advantage. When it hits, Sleeping Sentry doesn't capitalize on an advantage; it just wins. But for all the griping about the card, it's easy to deal with the Treachery effect with A Test of Will. (And to deal with the Shadow effect with Hasty Stroke and/or Burning Brand.)

As I see it, the problem isn't that the Dwarrowdelf cards are stronger than the Mirkwood cards. It's that there are still aspects of the game (treachery cancellation) that are only addressed by one card. Until we have multiple cards that perform similar functions (albeit in different ways), we have auto-include cards.

Zigil Miner may or may not be too strong, but it helps move away from the "auto-include" status of Steward of Gondor. Path of Need may or may not be too strong, but it's certainly not an auto-include. If anything, it gives players with expensive Zigil Miner decks something else to toy with instead of Grim Resolve.

And if you're like Boooored and don't think you can have fun with such powerful cards… um, don't play them? Seriously, who's building your decks for you?

because some people ie the 'boromir' types play for the challenge of winning, and when they see a card such as these that we are discussing, they want to capitalize on it, whether it makes it too easy or not…………fortunatly im not one of those people……..

## 32 [booored on June 5, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65503-new-preview-great-attatchment/?do=findComment&comment=640519)

that argument is stupid.. yes of course you do not play wit ha card of you do not like it.. that is what everybody dose. The ones most people deicide not to use or run special rules for are Beravore, Northern Tracker, Unexpected Courage, Feint and Ziggy, though I play with Feint and Beravor.

Arguments about if they are OP or not is not the point.. player can chose to sculpt his game experience.. BUT that isn't a excuse for poor game design. Just making stupid OP cards that radically alter the core mechanics of the game and turn it into a game that plays itself were you literally do NOTHING (as in this new attachment card dose) or say Ziggy that removes the entire concept of resources is just lame. Sure you can just not play it.. but wouldn't it be better if they just designed GOOD cards instead?

What this card is doing is removing the entire decision making process on if you should tap, or hold back your cards. So teh turn becomes.. draw cards, play cards, draw encounter cards count defence and attack values new turn. The ONLY player decisions in the entire game once this card is out is when and if to play events.. EVERYTHING else is controlled by teh game and all you do is flip cards from the encounter deck and count numbers on attack,defence and will..

That is just stupid… your not even playing the game it is playing itself.. and yes sure you do not have to run teh card.. but why design it in the first lace.. what were they possibly thinking.. I mean Ziggy was bad enough.. but this card removes the player from the game and it is just rules vs rules… .

But the location doesn't have to be active for too long. Of course one can try and make it so but it is not automatically achieved. The encounter deck can still surprise you even if your heroes are ready.

As for the Sleeping Sentry, I do agree, that one really can make false impression of the quest. I actually find that quest quite easy but for two cards that can ruin the game when come at a wrong time.

 Booored, I think you're overreacting just a little. Player choice is NOT removed from the game because Path of Need does not affect allies. There is still plenty of decision making on which allies to exhaust and when.

EDIT: Overreacting isn't the word I'm looking for. I shouldn't say things like "you are ____" on forums. Targetting others and telling them what they are thinking or doing is a sure-fire way to get emotions flaring and I apologize. I really meant to say, "Booored, I think the problem isn't as big as it may seem at first."

First off, there are very few locations that I feel have bad enough Trave effects that I don't want to get them out of the way.  Many games are won or lost in the staging area.

Cards that give such a different approach to the game are good.  It keeps thing from getting stale.  The challenge of building a deck to maximize the ability of a single card in a 50 card deck is appealing to me.  After I have experimented with it, Path of Need will get filed away with cards like Zigil Miner.  When I see future cards that compliment it's strengths and overcome it's weaknesses, I might use it again.  Until then, I will enjoy building new decks.  Half the challenge of card games is designing a deck that is able to deal with almost anything that your opponent can throw at you.  And if there are cards that allow us to do that in new and exciting ways, all the better!

@ the janitor - i agree, but i get exited no matter what cards comes out, as i usually spend the first 5 minutes looking at the artwork! i dont know how long youve been on the forum/playing the game, however we have had this argument about 5 times over now, so im just warning you, there is a definate split in players who take your side and players who takes booored and others….of course there's people in the middle as usual, but i think those who have chosen sides would have budged the first time round if they were going to happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]…..some people see it as new fresh approaches….some bad design…………

About this new card Path of Need, well, you are commenting a lot of it, but you are losing the best part (as richsabre noted), the amazing art of Magali Villeneuve lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif]. It seems that FFG people are counting on her for every new pack lately, a thing that really love aplauso.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/aplauso.gif].

About its usefulness, we shall see. It seems powerful, but only one in the deck, and a lot of cards needed to make the combos you comment above, I'm not sure we are going to auto-include it in all our decks. It's like Zigil Miner, I toyed with it for a while, but now, I don't use him at all. Just bored me.

About this new card Path of Need, well, you are commenting a lot of it, but you are losing the best part (as richsabre noted), the amazing art of Magali Villeneuve lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif]. It seems that FFG people are counting on her for every new pack lately, a thing that really love aplauso.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/aplauso.gif].

About its usefulness, we shall see. It seems powerful, but only one in the deck, and a lot of cards needed to make the combos you comment above, I'm not sure we are going to auto-include it in all our decks. It's like Zigil Miner, I toyed with it for a while, but now, I don't use him at all. Just bored me.

 

As for the latter, it again confirms the designers are actually succeeding on many accounts since players take different approach. Some say Steward in every deck, I can do without, I really enjoy Zigil combos, some are bored (no pun intended), some think Gimli is the thing, I think he's the worst Tactics hero… sorry to be giving personal examples but that's how it comes to mind. People have different views and they enjoy, at least quite a few it seems. Some say the game's too easy, some say too hard.

As for the former, it took me some time to realize it is Boromir in the picture (arrows, shield, horn, of course), I got confused by the quotes. And yes, MV is taking the spotlight, if you only take player cards, I think she might have like 20% in this cycle (2 per pack). There's no one else to compete with that frequency, although BZ is having quite a few locations which I find mostly gorgeous. I am not actually checking much from the enemy, treachery art, is there someone who appears much more frequently than others?

i do not believe so….it seems they are more focused when it comes to player cards- ill have to check

i think the major characters or 'important' cards such as path of need  always get more attention when it comes to art- makes sense i suppose

Look, maybe I am being a little harsh… yes it is true unless you get the combo out the attachment is not long for this world.. unless you have something like impassable bog out with 7 or w/e quest points. And yes ALL combo decks are OP… that is kinda how combo decks work… they are very weak but if the combo goes off then instant win.. though there is strong arguments in most CCGs about how combo decks should be limited as they screw with interactivity.

So in retrospect I guess I am being a little harsh.. but it frustrates me that instead of adding interactivity and synergy between cards they are adding cards that remove player interactions and card interactions.. and this imo is the complete wrong direction for a game.

The only way this card is useful is if there are more enemies engaged with you than you can handle. You still have to exhaust allies to quest. I'm surprised nobody is talking about this card in conjunction with a dwarf deck, though. Erebor Hammersmith+Sneak Attack with Legacy of Durin in play, plus Dain being able to participate in attacks for a round while getting his own buff. I don't think this is a gamebreaker because combat, in most quests, isn't how you win the game. It's an expensive card with a limited scope.

## 43 [lleimmoen on June 6, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65503-new-preview-great-attatchment/?do=findComment&comment=640915)

I think so far people have tried to cover how to "get most out of the card." What you're saying with Dain is "who shall get most out of the card once you get most out of the card," if that makes any sense. And of course, Dain is a perfect ride. I was also thinking of Stand Together having a great effect when you can defend repeatedly with three heroes. But the choice then be plentiful. As someone else pointed, I too wonder if we soon shall see a card that allows for a second attack against an enemy, I know Quick Strike does but only for one character.

Something that puzzled me about Path of Need: Does a location (ie The Carrock) with a "Immune to player card effects." text prevent you from attaching Path of Need to it or not? I'm not sure as the actual effect of the card isn't interacting with the exploration of the carrock at all and it seems that this text was created to prevent the players to explore the location too early. But on the other hand…. it's a player card you're attaching…

## 45 [richsabre on June 6, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65503-new-preview-great-attatchment/?do=findComment&comment=641013)

yes id say it was immune still - taking it very literally 'player card effects' is

1. is it a player card?

2.does it in anyway interact with the location?

yes and yes….the 2nd one yes as the effect is 'piggybacking' off the carrock

Point taken. However, I have one final counterpoint.  Lord of the Rings is different then most CCGs.  Because it's a Co-op game, some of the combo decks can actually improve interactivity.  Instead of just hoping to lock into your power combo, it can be you and an ally working towards the same goal, each helping the other get the parts needed to make it work.  This is the biggest draw of LotR for me, it involves building decks that are not only strong, but are able to synergize with what my teammates are building.

I disagree. If the card said, "Attach a location to Path of Need." I would see that as an effect and The Carrock would be immune to it. As it is written, the card has no effect on the active location. It is not moving the active location and it is not adding progress to the active location. It simply says "Attach to a location," which is an effect on the card, not the location. If The Carrock said, "Immune to player cards," again, I would concede that Path of Need could not work.

Hmm. I'm still thinking about this. "Attach to a location" is a player card effect, and I suppose the target of the effect is indeed the location, so maybe Richsabre is right. Grrr! I was so excited about that combo!

i always think it as (and i may be wrong again here) the immune locations cannot be tampered with in any way as they are part of the scenario…at least thats what the designers had in mind i think

The Carrock does say "immune to player cards," does it not?

Ok, so this is a techy kind of question… There is a few ways to look at this and again this is the kind of thing that should be a lot clearer. Is an attachment a player card effect ON the location. Say an Mathom… the effect is happening ON the Mathom card not on the location and triggered when teh location leaves play..… This is kind of like the target effect rule. Targeting a location specifically with an affect (not a card) is different that a global effect that targets all cards of a certain type on the board… EG: Dark Knowledge is a targeted affect and Burning Brand is not.

This is a very common thing and is in CoC, aGoT and a famous example is in magic the gathering Wrath of God vs Lightning Bolt.

I think technically this immune to player effects is talking about targeted affects.. so Northern Tracker, Lorian Guide, Shadowborn Scout, Riddermark Finest etc etc etc.. .there are tons.. these are all cards that target the location and resolves ON the location effecting the location itself. The Mathom or in this case this new card I hate effects is not occouring on the location. The effect is not targeting the location, nor is the effect doing anything to the location at all.

This is how the rule read to me on a techy level. So I think yes you can cast this on such places.. BUT I also think this is NOT what the designers mean. After playing this game form release I have a feel for their terrible wording and it very well could be talking about all player "card" interaction not player "effects".

Might need a ruling on this form nate

Well I kinda disagree here .. Tragic said it best in his 3 player deck construction video. In LoTR (say in a 3 player game) you are making ONE DECK that is getting played by three people at once. Yes the different players deck interact, but you build them all together to work as one. So all the same deck building rules apply. There is nothing "different" you are literally making a single deck no matter how many players are playing the game.

I think it's a bit more complicated then that.  You are making three different decks, each that has to work with itself AND with the other decks in your team.  While the ultimate goal is one deck, with it being split into multiple parts, it is very important that each part is also able to function as a separate unit.

Yes, sometimes I deckbuild in another deck in mind but I would never put cards which the deck couldn't play without the other deck, like including Rivendell Blade without Elven characters. It wouldn't feel right for me but each to his own.

no, if the decks can function by themselves then they doing 2 much and splitting their focus leading to weaker decks.

You do not need to place battle orientated characters in the questing deck, you need questers. The ONLY cards that need to be in any given deck are allies as they can only be played on your side.

Any events and attachments can be placed in any deck regardless of witch deck has targets.

If you build a 2 player deck and try to make them both in teh same way you build a a solo deck all you are doing is diluting the power of the decks as a whole function for a given game situation. It is much better to specialise each deck for certain functions.

This is exactly how you build a solo deck, as in you have to build a solo deck to handle many game situations at once… when building a multiplayer deck you do the same thing but to strength the power of the deck to deal with these situations you can specialise each individual deck.

This is one of the hardest concepts for deck designers who come to this game to work out. It is a typical newish player mistake, especially for those that come from other deck construction games because (as far as I know) LoTRlcg is the only game that has these completely interdependent deck setups.

You really need to consider the two decks as a single deck, and build it accordingly.

I do like to build a questing deck, deck for combat, deck that draws cards, deck that earns resources, yes, but then I don't want to be bound to play say deck A with deck B, I like variety so I am glad if deck A can also play with deck C or D. As a rule the decks A and B do well against quest X and decks A and C against quest Y. The theme, fun and funtion seem nicely combined, at least to me (and my mates).
