# [LOTR: The Card Game - upcoming products list](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/201212-lotr-the-card-game-upcoming-products-list/)

## 1 [timbolton on February 2, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/201212-lotr-the-card-game-upcoming-products-list/?do=findComment&comment=2028550)

Expected releases (updated 5 MAY 2019)

Another year begins, so as we slowly make our way through 2019, this thread continues to monitor the LOTR LCG releases in the UK shops (not online).

The old thread is located here [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/113508-list-of-sets-to-be-released-as-of-gencon-2014/]. 

The info is based on availability in UK shops, so please use this as a guide only and not a definite for non-UK locations. UK release information from Asmodee UK [http://www.esdeviumgames.com/]  (formerly Esdevium Games). Once I have picked up an item in a UK-based shop (or had confirmation it is definitely in stores), I then move that item to "Now released in the UK" section.

I add "No UK release as yet" to any product which FFG has released in the USA or POD but we haven't seen in the UK shops.

Please post any needed changes, additions, etc below and I'll update the original post asap!

 

Is the colour scheme ok for people? I have a dark background set on mine, so the coiours work.

Thanks! I thought I had it but couldn't see it anywhere online, like you said it's out of stock and that sometimes means not released. Just checked my storage box and I do have it! Edited the main post now :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Is something like this necessary when FFG lists the upcoming products on the Product page?

> Is something like this necessary when FFG lists the upcoming products on the Product page?

This keeps track of things for (at least) the UK people on here who at times can get products 2 months or more after the US, I keep an eye on the UK side of things, as soon as it's in physical shops, I update. Been doing this from the start, if you check the older thread, no complaints before ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

 

Edit: oh and plus, I don't list released items, so if you want to click through every area on the products page, please go ahead, whereas here only the due ones are listed, away from info about other games.

So the answer is "no," but I suppose you can do what you like. As for myself, I'll just ignore this thread and leave it at that.

Yes this thread is necessary because,

A: ffg upcoming page is often inaccurate or not updated for some products, and

B: ffg rubbish upcoming page has ZERO info on pod products which for lotr is a fair chunk!

So thank you for this thread and please ignore unwarranted negativity.

Grey Havens is now available in UK stores (picked my copy up from Travelling Man, Manchester - great store!)

 

The PODs Ruins of Belegost and Murder at Prancing Pony are now available via FFG's website and I expect them to be available to purchase from UK stores in the near future. I'll update their entries then. If you want to buy straight from FFG (the shipping abroad can be quite heavy), go to https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2016/2/18/new-adventures-in-middle-earth/ [https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2016/2/18/new-adventures-in-middle-earth/]

Gameslore is the one I usually get from :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
Esvedium Games is the company that brings the games across to the UK and then distributes them to stores like Gameslore ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] -- so always good to go to them first and their weekly list (out usually Friday/Saturday for the next week)

Updated again (5 JULY 2016)

 

I am picking up "Temple of the Deceived [https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2016/1/6/temple-of-the-deceived/]" this week, so I'll move that to released as soon as I have it.
Added the final Dream Chaser AP and also the latest Nightmare deck.

Hiya,

"Officially released" is USA, in the UK (and other places) we can get stuff a lot later, months even. I tend to keep on top of releases our side of the pond. If I can pick it up in a physical store in the UK then it is definitely out, I have no special method of getting things earlier than anyone (aside the USA). I had hoped I'd covered that in the blurb before the list, I'll check to see if it doesn't make sense.

Games Lore have been pretty good with their releases. A couple of times they had AGoT 2e and LotR stuff before what "everybody" said was the European release date. I have to wait 6-8 days from ordering though, and I've only finished buying three cycles not even in sequence, so everything might as well have release dates in 2017 ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

 

Keep doing the lists till you're sick of it.

"Temple of the Deceived" is definitely out in the UK, so it's moved to released. Whilst I was in London picking that up, a new nightmare pack has been released ("The Treason of Saruman") and now a new deluxe set has been confirmed - "The Sands of Harad." First post has been updated to reflect that ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

Woe unto my bank account! I have roughly 3 cycles now (not sequential), so a healthy game is unhealthy for me :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

 

My FLGS even lists the latest cycle as in stock, so it's tempting! But of course no deluxe boxes. Can't expect them to be consistent.

Some of the older deluxes can be hard to find at times, I have seen most in Orc's Nest London but other stores have "out of stock" on quite a few. Best of luck getting all the ones you need :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Great :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]


The Nightmare version of the Lost Realm seems to have snuck into the UK shops, it definitely wasn't on the Esvedium games lists, so it's possible the shop ordered some directly from FFG. I've moved it to released in the UK for now.

 

Looks like we are getting just one set for both Gen Con and Fellowship events, rather than the usual two, maybe because it aimed at more players than usual. Updated the info for that one.

Slightly OT but maybe of interest to UK and European members especially (although the creator is now offering US mail) is a kickstarter for cheap dividers - approx. £8 per core box with 3 columns unsleeved. Don't want to upset the forum mods, and not sure if a link is appropriate, but if anyone is interested and wants to find out more, you can PM me.  

 

I'm not associated with the KS by the way, although I have invested.

It's already in stock and shipping from Games Lore - I think they added it yesterday or earlier. I believe that is the most reliable store "near" me right now.

Thanks guys!

 

Yep, the Esdevium list says it's out today, I'm picking it up tomorrow. I'll move it then on the first page. I'm also going to keep an eye out for the latest Nightmare Pack, Esdevium seem to miss their UK releases.

I spoke to my local FLGS and it sounds like they have FOTW in-store but can't sell it until Thursday (they didn't out and out say it but they were fairly certain it would be out then and they get their games deliveries from Esdevium on Tuesday).

Wasn't sure where to find this info, or post, but my partner and I have been playing progressively, and about to reach the Khazad-Dum Deluxe Expansion of Dwarrowdelf Cycle. Buuut, the deluxe expansion is out of stock literally everywhere.

 

Is this a sign, that maybe I should buy up all the older stuff ASAP? Cause it would suck to skip a whole cycle, and I don't want to run up to "out of stock" on the older expansions when we get to them.

 

Any news on reprinting dates or advice?

## 38 [evilidler on August 10, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/201212-lotr-the-card-game-upcoming-products-list/?do=findComment&comment=2357470)

Khazad-Dûm is at the printer right now, so add (5 or fewer weeks) print time + (6 or fewer weeks) boat time + (2 or fewer weeks) shipment from FFG. They reprint LotR all the time, so it's only a matter of patience.

 

If desperate, try ordering from any country with some in stock. The nearest mail-order place to me has 5 or 6 in stock, but it would also be $70+ ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

Oh okay thanks! Phew. Is there a page where you can see what's at the printer? I vaguely remember seeing that, but we got into a 3-4 month hiatus on playing during the summer, so I haven't been as active looking stuff up online lol

Yeah, Upcoming right at the top of the site :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

(My calculations were based on seeing Khazad-Dûm enter reprint at least a week ago - they typically take 6 weeks to finish it at worst. Could be a month, in which case it's going to be here in October.)

Ah of course it's that easy haha

 

That's not too bad. We just picked back up, completing the Dead Marshes quest. Hills of Emyn Muil wrecked us and we have 1 more quest in that cycle, besides just trying Emyn Muil over again. Cool! Thanks for the help :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Do you want me to start add upcoming reprints to here? I hadn't thought of them, being more focused on new stuff.

 

I've added the new Adventure Pack cycle to the list ("Haradrim" for the Sands of Time Deluxe) and moved a few releases about, some to "Now out" etc.

And someone mentioned in another thread what the next (and final) Saga expansion was going to be called (it was mentioned in the last released expansion supposedly) but I can't find which thread the mention is in and can't see the info in the last expansion box.

It's "The Mountain of Fire" and it's mentioned at the bottom of the third paragraph on the front page of the rules.

With this listed on that Upcoming products page, I don't think so, it had just been a while since I had visited these sites so I was feeling lost. But I leave that up to you and anyone else who may like that info added here.

I dunno if reprint status is needed. People can click "Upcoming" and filter for LCG reprints themselves :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Another thing to bear in mind is that the convention standalone scenario, "massing at osgiliath" was released between the MIrkwood cycle and the Dwarrowdelf (Kazahd Dum) cycle, so if you are playing in order, then you also have the Massing quest to have a go at as well.

Massing is a print-on-demand scenario and so in theory never goes out of print and can be ordered directly from FFG

And The Battle of Lake-town I believe is between the last two scenarios of the second Hobbit saga box (On the Doorstep). There's a chronological chart somewhere, probably :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

You're missing the Harad deluxe expansion.
