If I play "Radagast's Cunning" before "A Frightened Beast" is revealed from the encounter deck, do I have to add the threat of the enemy that I played RC on? I guess that it's not the case, but wanted to make it sure.

 

If so, am I right that it is not possible to play RC after AFB has been revealed?

i agree with both of your points, i think it would not be counted but you cannot play it as a response to drawing a frightened beast

As no one has intervened, I conclude we're both right.

Thanks for answering!
