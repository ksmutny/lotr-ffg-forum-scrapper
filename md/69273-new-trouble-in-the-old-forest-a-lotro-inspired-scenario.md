 Hey guys! I recently started work on my own scenario for LOTR LCG.Id love you all to take a look and give me some feedback on the direction

Also, if anyone is interested in taking a look at the cards that I have already created for the scenario and adding their thoughts / feedback / ideas, Id really love to hear from you!  By the way, I'm aware of the spelling error on some of the cards and they need some touching up - Im just in the process of printing out a test deck and designing "Old Man Willows" abilities. The first scenario feels very much like "Passage Through Mirkwood", I think mainly due to the forest / spiders theme…but hopefully I can introduce something a little different on an over-arching story etc. The difficulty should ramp up and im already working on some ideas for the second and third scenarios.

Seems very cool.  Would work well with other encounter cards from the core set, naturally.  Just reread the Fellowship and was actually wondering how this section could play out as an adventure, glad to see you try to tackle it!  Please keep us posted on this project aplauso.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/aplauso.gif]

 Thanks guys!

Clicking on the link under the card picture should take you to my blog that has a few more samples.
Im really trying to make the three parts tie into each other thematically, so hopefully I can introduce something that's interesting and fun.

Im currently working on Old Man Willow and how he will work in the deck.  Ive got some ideas, just need to test them.  The whole first quest is quite spider heavy, but I think that's OK at this point.  The next two quests well and truly move away from the Forest and your mundane creatures like bats, wolves and spiders and move into a new and interesting that will have a bit of a "Hunt for Gollum" mechanic while ramping up the difficulty a little.

If you guys have any ideas about what youd like to see, or mechanics that you think would fit well with the theme, please let me know :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Good luck with the project, I think the artwork looks great so far. Consistency is important to define the feel of the quest.

If you want to borrow some ideas, I designed a quest in the Old Forest too and you're free to borrow any of the ideas I had.

To see the cards, follow this link [http://www.blackmoor.org.uk/lotr.htm]below and scroll down to the Old Forest and hit the preview button. The slideshow can be paused by hovering over the card images.

Really nice work. Would love to try when you're done! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
