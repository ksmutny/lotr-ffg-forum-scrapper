hi everyone

 

Ive just been starting to play lotr lcg...

 

and Im really cofused with this card

 

ffg_stand-together-core.jpg [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/ffg_stand-together-core.jpg]

 

as what ive understand at first, was you can defend any number of characters with one enemy

 

but after thinking about it, it says that "as defenders against EACH enemy attacking"

 

what if this means that you can defend with any number of eligible defenders with all attacking enemies?

 

well the allocation of damage will still me there as what the other forums are arguing but you can also combine this casd with this

 

 

swift strike

 

i mean you could deal a lot of damage to each attacking enemy if this could be happen

 

hope any of you guys enlighten me with this....thank you

This card doesn't change how the enemies attack, and that is, one by one.

This card say you can declare  "as DEFENDERS against each enemy attacking" but each enemy still attack one by one, so you have to declare your new defender each time, because defenders allways refere to one attack.

Yes, you can defend an attack with multiple defenders and combine Defense values.
