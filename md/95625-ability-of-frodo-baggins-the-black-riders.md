The ability reads:

"Response: Spend 1 resource and exhaust The One Ring to cancel the effects of an encounter card just revealed from the encounter deck.  Shuffle that card back into the encounter deck and reveal another encounter card."

 

My questions:

1.If an encounter card with no effects such as "when revealed", "surge", "hide X", etc.(example: Location: Pathless Country/Enemy: Evil Crow) is revealed, is it possible to use the ability just to reveal a new encounter card?

 

2.In order to travel to "The Last Bridge", a Burden card must be revealed as if it were revealed from the encounter deck. Is it possible to use the ability to cancel the effect of the Burden card and thus, shuffle it into the encounter deck and reveal a new encounter card, even if the new one is not a Burden card?

 

Thanks in advance.
