So my wife and I just finished her first run of the saga campaign.  Normally we don't keep score, but thought it would be fun to do for this.  Now she is currious how ours compares with others.  So if you have a score let me know.

 

Ours (including The Old Forest, and Fog on the Barrow-downs) is 2920
