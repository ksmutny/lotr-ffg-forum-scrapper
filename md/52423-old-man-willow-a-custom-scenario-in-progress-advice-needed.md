hi, just thought id let you know that im busy making a scenario involving the old forest and the barrow downs, designed for solo play, however i would like to ask previous designers how they sourced their images that arent used already in the game.

 

so far im just using a high res. googled image, quite nice but i dont own the copyright, so how has other people gone about this? i know one uses LOTR online so maybe a print screen?

 

thanks
