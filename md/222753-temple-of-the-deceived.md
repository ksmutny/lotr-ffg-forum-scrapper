> Fantastic!! So curious about the new Leadership hero.

Me too! I'm really hoping for another hero who plays with locations. Idraen is one of my all-time favorite heroes, just because she encouraged such a unique style of location-control.

## 5 [Gizlivadi on June 16, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/222753-temple-of-the-deceived/?do=findComment&comment=2268672)

We know he'll be a Scout too. I hope he has lowish threat and decent willpower, since so many Leadership heroes recently are combat focused in their stats, like Amarthiúl and Denethor (both of which are excellent heroes btw). It could be something like Grimbold, or some other minor character like that. At first I thought Hirgon, but since we just got Denethor and are getting Imrahil it's doubtful we'll se another Gondor hero. Rohan or Noldor would be my guesses. And as always, I hope for a neutral Artifact, but that kinda goes without saying.

I'm stoked for some undead action. And to finally find out, how exactly Sahir is going to betray us. However the last part will probably happen in drowned ruins.

I am hoping for Grimbeorn. But those hopes seem wild at the moment, though we should get him as a player card before the game is done, he is still one of the reasonably important characters from the story (even named in the LotR) we have not seen.

Also, what do we know so far about the pack beside the Leadership hero? This is the last unknown hero in the cycle, right? What about Gildor Inglorion? He was a leader of his people… and the ally version came in the very first cycle… I think we should get one more Noldor, none of the other heroes in the cycle are...

We know the hero is a Scout. I guess that limits the possible characters. And I doubt that it will be another FFG-created hero, since there are already 3 of them in the cycle.

Well, it usually takes a little while, though last time the french spoilers appeared the day the shipping was announced, I believe.

 

Yes, the scout trait probably rules out both Grimbeorn and Gildor, although we should get an Elf scout, they seem very well suited for the trait, and there are few so far...

 

Surely not another ffg-created hero, though I generally do not mind them at all.

Why I can't shake off the feeling that Scout is going to be Rohan?

What scouts exist in Tolkien´s world? I could see Mablung and Damrod, but both of them have good (and quite now) hero versions. Haldir is one, but he doesn´t fit in leadership. No (I think) named Dale characters except Brand is alive during the time period, and Dale seems to have multiple scouts (Lanwyn, Ravenhill Scout and Celduin Traveller). Aragorn could be a scout, and Elladan/Elrohir/Halbarad, but of them only Elladan lacks a leadership version. The Rohan warrior Ceorl could be a scout too, he´s a too minor character to became a hero (I think).

 

As Haldir is a scout, maybe one of his brothers (Rúmil and Orophin) will be promoted into a scout hero. Legolas seems more like a warrior to me, but it is an option.

Another candidate is Hirgon, the gondorian rider who carried the red arrow to Théoden. Or maybe it´s time for Ghan-buri-Ghan to be our first wose hero (they seems to be scouts).

 

Did I forget someone?

It would be actually pretty funny if Ghan-buri-Ghan would decide to invade Lotr of the Rigns at this time. What's more fitting for a wose than a sea voyage to the tropical island? :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

I would not be surprised about a Rohan hero, we have not had them in a while, right? At least in a cycle. But I am not very fond of Leadership Rohan. I would rather see Noldor flashed out a little more in that direction...

Given that Ceorl has been spoiled as an ally (in this pack, no less), I think we can be sure he's not the hero.

That's a good point. If it is Rohan, then who fits best? Gamling, Grimbold, and Eomer all seem like good fits for the leadership sphere, but Gamling is the only one I could see donning the Scout trait.

That was also at a time the game didn't really know what it was doing (not to anyone's real fault). Ever since Caleb and Matt "took office" we've seen a much wider variety of heroes in cycles, and which they have explicitly said they strive for.

Tl;dr: It's much more likely they will do things more like the past 2 cycles than Dwarrowdelf.

Just curious, do you know the exact point where Caleb and Matt took office?   I'm curious how far the game was developed before they took over.

To the best of my recollection it was after Dwarrowdelf heading into Gondor.

Caleb started working in the LCG with the Hobbit boxes, and then he joined the developer team during Against the Shadow and finally became lead developer in the Ring-Maker cycle.

I just want for once a cycle that's not about Noldor. I buy Dwarrowdelf, realize most of the cards are Noldor and not Dwarf. Then, Angmar cycle, supposed to be about Dunedain, but has a bunch of Noldor synergies instead. Now we've got a Noldor cycle. Grr.

## 34 [Ecthelion III on June 18, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/222753-temple-of-the-deceived/?do=findComment&comment=2271955)

This cycle isn't actually mostly Noldor. Granted, there are a few cards here and there (Glorfindel, Imladris Caregiver, Defender), but so were there a few Dunedain cards in Angmar Awakened (Descendants of Kings, Guardian of Arnor, Fornost Bowman). The deluxe box is often completely different than the cycle.

 

Khazad Dum - Dwarves

Dwarrowdelf - Noldor (& variety)

 

Heirs of Numenor - Gondor

Against the Shadow - Mono Sphere

 

Voice of Isengard - Doomed, Rohan

Ringmaker - Silvan, Silvan, & Silvan

 

Lost Realm - Dunedain

Angmar Awakened - Noldor (& variety, including Rossiel VD)

 

Grey Havens - Noldor

Dream-chaser - Gondor, Paying Extra Resources of a Different Sphere

If that's the case, I'm calling it now, a beorning that is also a scout. And the next cycle will be the beorning cycle.

Hobbit boxes were just after Dwarrowdelf, either side of Heirs.

And while Dwarrowdelf wasn't exactly stuffed with Dwarf cards, it included the Battle Master, Lure of Moria and Legacy of Durin, which are some of the most powerful Dwarf cards, so they didn't exactly get short shrift in the cycle.

I'm coming here everyday to see if there is any spoiler of the new hero, so... it looks like we'll have to wait until the first player receives it and show us who is.

 

As I read in the post, I also have a feeling that the hero in this pack will have the Rohan trait. The hero uses to be related to some of the other cards in the pack (not always, but is usual), and in this pack we'll get two unique Rohan allies and a mount... maybe a sign of the new hero trait ?

 

I'd like a Rohan ally HERO(edited) with an ability related to mounts... (Maybe get an attack or deffense bonus for each attached mount, or give that bonus to other heroes).

I just got my pack last night! Wasn't expecting it so early, but anyway, the new hero is Elfhelm. Rohan, Scout, Warrior traits with 2/2/2, 4 health 10 starting threat. Text is: Spirit heroes with a mount gain 1 willpower, tactics heroes with a mount gain 1 attack, and leadership heroes with a mount gain 1 defense. I think the other cards that hadn't already been spoiled were a lore event that does 1 damage to enemies in the staging area and can pay extra to do 2 more, and a tactics event that blanks an enemies text box, as well as a neutral dwarf ally, 3 cost, 1/1/1 with 2 health that is put into play if it's discarded off the top of your deck. If nobody posts their names and stuff I'll do it when I get home from work.

This sounds awesome. A universal buff that makes the mounts - most of which are already very playable - even more fantastic.

 

Hobbit Pony on (spirit) Merry or Frodo.

Rohan Warhorse on (tactics) Merry, (tactics) Aragorn.

Firefoot on Eomer now gives him 8 attack (if a character has left play)

Snowmane on either version of Theoden (still slightly better on tactics Theoden, since he would quest for 3 and attack for 4)

The new Armored Destrider on (leadership) Aragorn lets him quest for 3 (if he has Celebrian's Stone) ready (if you pay 1 resource), defend for 3, and attack for 3.

Arod on Legolas lets him swing for 4 (and doesn't take up a restricted slot)

Asfaloth on (spirit) Glorfindel

Steed of Imladris on Idraen (or any questing spirit hero, really)

As 13nrv pointed out, Armored Destrider is fantastic on Amarthiul

Yes !

 

Many other combo :

 

Steed of Imladris + Narya + Cirdan

Oin could gain +1 attack and +1 wp with a mount when you have 5 dwarves.

A dwarf with narvi's belt and a mount could choose the kind of bonus

 

etc ...

 

We can easily have a hero with +1 to each stats.

I wonder how, and if, this hero changes things up for a solo Rohan deck. A tri-sphere deck sounds very tempting, with Theoden questing for 3, Eomer attacking for 4 and Elfhelm defending for 3 if they all have simple mounts. But, being tri-sphere you'll be starving for Spirit resources. I wonder if Theodred is still the best hero for this solo deck.

Hero- Elfhelm

Leadership- Ceorl and Destrier

Tactics- Deorwine and text box blanking event

In retrospect, it makes sense that we would get Elfhelm in this cycle since they're filling out the Battle of Pelennor Fields heroes who couldn't fit in Flame of the West.

Does anyone else feel like the Scout trait on him is a little forced, though? It doesn't fit the image of him I have in my head.

Yes, certainly does not fit the scout theme too much. There is the Snowbourne Scout -- both Leadership and Rohan but I believe Elfhelm was a commander of Rohirrim, thus the sphere fits, the scout trait not so much.

 

As for the Arrows, I still don't believe it would deal damage to every enemy in the staging area...

I'm imagining a solo deck with Spirit Eowyn, Spirit Theoden and Elfhelm. With Leadership you get access to Steward, and with Snowmane and Herugrim on Theoden you can have him hit for 6, while Elfhelm defends for 3 and readies with the Destrier. Might be good, though maybe Theodred is better for solo.

Elfhelm seems great and very splaahable.

Arrows from the trees could be insane in the right deck I think.

Dwarf ally is ok, he needs more support for the milling archetype to excel.

Revealed in wrath seems also very good, too bad it's an action instead of a response to an enemy revealed from the encounter deck.

Destrier is also good.

Well, I can't see what you can be missing about the Arrows, I think it easily moves the Ithilien trap decks from sort of ok to very enemy efficient. Of course, there are quests where enemies will jump at you (though Ranger Spikes combo perfectly with this). 1 Lore and 3 Tactics resources for 3 damage to several enemies seems like a great deal to me.

On the other hand, I can't see Revealed in Wrath to be anything but situational, but I certainly hope I am missing something. I have been looking forward to this card since the art had been revealed.

Revealed In Wrath is so amazing.

You can deny every forced effects or passive effect from a non unique enemy for 1 tactics resource. It's so powerful.

You can put a Mumak in a forest snare! Play Revealed In Wrath in the resource   Planing Phase then play your trap, and you have a nice Mumak who will not bother you anymore. :wub: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wub.png]

 

Elfhelm is amazing too.The songs are working with him. You can so easily have Eomer attacking to 8, with just his Firefoot. Steed of the mark is now a very good card since it is not restricted.

 

Best AP for player cards since Celebrimbor Secret i think.

Well, how will the enemies that say "no attachment" work once their text is not blank any more?

 

And true, finally, Steed of the Mark has some meaning with Elfhelm on board, especially for two-sphere heroes who will get a double action and a double bonus for it.

hm...  as usual I'm not sold (on Elfhelm) right away...  and I love my rohan decks.

First off, Elfhelm is already a very powerful Rohan ally.    He's one of the better ones that we've got.   The mere fact that the card reads "elfhelm" is a major disadvantage already.  Raw stats,  Elfhelm hero only has +1 W and +1 hp over his ally version so...   not exactly lighting the world on fire here.    10 threat,   that's higher than I want it.  For 10 threat I can get Erkenbrand in the same sphere, who has better stats, and a very strong ability.  

I just don't love Ld Rohan anyway.   For allies we have the very underwhelming Snowbourn Scout,  Warden of Helm's Deep (not bad, but not amazing), and the unique Eothain who isn't that great either.  

Ok, so are you going to play him just for his ability?   Well... mmmm...maybe?     If you are running Elfhelm hero at all you're probably in the spirt sphere already because you are going to want Horse Breeder.  So that's 2 heros, most likely Eowyn or Theoden.  Taking the last of that trio might be okay,   but you'll miss out on the Tactics mounts.   You could take Eomer instead and go with a tri-sphere,  but that's a bit dangerous and if you don't take Eowyn you're pretty weak on willpower.  If you do take Eowyn you miss Theoden's discount,  maybe you don't need it with Steward of Gondor.   But IMO, leave that for the gondor players ;D.

So what have you got now.   Snowmane is pretty good, esp with Herugrim,  the Rohan Warhorse is sort of still lame.   1 cost for 1 WP, A, or D,  I mean it's okay.  It's probably not a card slot.   Armored Destrider is really good,  but it's good because it's an amazing card,  not necessarily because of Elfhelm's +1.   I mean..... wouldn't you rather just have Erkenbrand with an Armored Destrider instead?  

Rohan Warhorse and Firefoot probably make the best use of Elfhelm's ability, but as I said, tactics is hard to squeeze in.

I could see Elfhelm being strong to have on the table in multiplayer when lots of people are running mounts anyway.   Asfaloth hits the table a lot, so there's an easy 1 WP, and the rohan warhorse shows up a lot too, as I imagine the Armored Destrider will also.   the more players, the more his ability is a benefit.   But I don't think he's worth it for solo, or even 2 deck play.

Elfhelm would be awesum in multiplayer. Just being on the board makes Rohan Warhorse +1 attack AND ready, my artillery deck would very much enjoy that.

I don't like these multiplayer "players as a group spend 3" cards.

 

What ever happened to x, where x is the number of players, and variables to that effect?

I don't think Elfhelm Ally is a very important card at all. Largely marginalised due to its hefty cost. An ok ability, but not one that synergises particularly well with the Rohan trait. I would argue that Elfhelm was a very mediocre card, and an updated version has long been overdue.

I used to like Elfhelm ally but he is so situational. With Rohan, you want to be questing well, and then he just defies doom which does not appear (much or at all) in about half of the quests. The cost of 4 is a lot for that.

 

You can have Elfhelm Leadership, Éowyn Tactics and Théoden Spirit. With Théoden's discount and some Song of Travel (that should go on Éowyn), you should be able to afford to pay the Spirit allies just fine. Tactics might not be needed so much in such a deck but it is nice utility to have, and again, with the songs, Éowyn can pay for other cards.

No, archery happens at the beginning of the combat phase, same as dealing shadow cards, so you don't have an action window.

They're not consistently 3, and in this case they aren't scaled to the number of players, so it wouldn't make sense to cost them that way. Instead they're costed by the power of the effect. The only time we've had X where X is the number of players on a player card that I remember is The White Council - which is a nice card, but one previous instance doesn't seem to give much cause for exclaiming "Whatever happened to" about it. It was never a general thing to have anything happen to it.

A minor point, but I am very glad that the effect is for all heroes, rather than just Rohan heroes. It means Elfhelm can fit well into other decks; he is an excellent hero to splash into Spirit or Tactics decks, bringing some boosted attachments with him if he does.

It was better than this method. Maybe it should have been a general thing (feels like it's fairly common on encounter deck cards anyway).

I quite prefer the multisphere approach they're taking now. I found the white council worked well enough for solo or two player, but once you got to spending 3 or 4 resources it just wasn't worth the cost.. The cost by power of effect makes much more sense and encourages interaction between players to boot.

I don't find Elfhelm (ally) to be too expensive.   He costs 4 but really that's 3-and-a-Theoden if you're playing Rohan.  His ability is fair, but not great, no.   What he does have is very strong stats for a 3+T cost.   Particularly he has good combat stats for Spirit.   But sure, I could deal without him.   Definitely the least important part of that entire earlier post.

White Council isn't great except as a smoothing card for solo game, but the cost mechanics are sound. It's the effects that needed work when scaling up.

 

Arrows gets cheaper and far, far more powerful with more players added to a game. Goes too far in the other direction.

Sure, but barring the use of Advance Warning, with more players it also becomes more difficult keeping all the enemies in the staging area until after their engagement checks

Elfhelm is not a game changer, but he'll see play.  The Westfold Horsebreeder is a good pairing for a deck with him, but not as essential as you have made it (your comments above assume Spirit in every build).  I'd probably use him 2-player in an Eomer/Erkenbrand/Elfhelm "Triple E" deck.  "Ride of the Es?"  

 

Anyway.

 

In the groups I play in, losing the Elfhelm ally would not make a splash.  He's a solid ally, but the people I play with make Rohan questing decks, and combat is well-handled by other deck.  If Elfhelm is questing, you don't get his ability, at which point he's an overcosted 2-willpower quester wit no frills.  

 

I like this hero, but I can't say he really inspires me to build new decks.

Don't forget the enemy doesn't have to be in play! You can blank a Dol Guldur Nazgul so it stays out of play eternally.

You can blank some wargs who you saw 8 rounds ago, or an Attercop, Attercop to stay in the staging area, a jealous traitor, some Ring-greedy Nazguls, some Oathbreaker with the Phantom keyword in FotW, inmediate attack guys, aditional shadow guys, cannot optionally engage guys, deal damage guys, raise threat guys, random discard guys...

Quest basically has you looking for the guardian with the key first, and then you have to find the right Temple of the Deceived. Locations in the staging area are any of four locations directly North, South, East, and West of your current location as you travel through the map.

It has the makings of a very tough nightmare quest though, the only reason it's not too bad is the lack of very punishing enemies. If you game the exploration mechanic and just kinda stay safe and scout stuff ahead of time you can make very direct routes to what you need and avoid falling into the nastier stuff. Very fun though, both this and Thing in the Depths are definitely top 10 quests in my opinion!

Thanks!

 

Guys, what do you think about Scouting Party, to me it seems quite hard to think I could build a deck around the scout trait. Of course we might get more in the future but how long it may take to have enough? I haven't checked all the allies but there certainly are very few heroes. And I was actually thinking this might be the last cycle they release… Now I think it shall be penultimate one since the last saga won't come out before the next year… I know this is a very different topic: just renting… but really, Scouting Party? Any potential?

There are easily enough Scouts for Scouting Party to be worth it. +2 to all your questing characters gets worth it pretty fast, especially when it only costs 2.

What deck do you have in mind?

I remember there was a consensus even Lords of the Eldar (one of the strongest cards in the game, in my opinion) is not worth its 3 resources, and it gives the full all stat boost till the end of the round to all Noldor no matter what (ok, +1 willpower but still). If Scouting Party said +2 willpower to all Scout characters, I would not question it but that "if" clause seems much more plausible.

I didn't look to see what the difficulty rating on this quest was, but a friend and I played this yesterday evening and it was really cool.  It started off like we had lucked out and found one of the locations we needed in the opening setup. We started at the other location and built up while we reached the important one.  Then it looked like we were going to be able to just truck along in a straight path with relatively not-terrible locations but when we got to the last row we found out that we had to go through several more locations to get to the right one.   He was playing Noldor questing with Cirdan, Arwen and Erestor.  I was using Ents with Beregond, Mablung and Treebeard.  At no point did we feel like it was out of our control.  Good draws on our part and relatively friendly locations in our way made our first run through pretty easy but still enjoyable.   I'm looking forward to playing it again to see how random this experience was.

That makes sense.   There are a few mean treacheries and potential shadow combinations, but I think they took it easy on us since they were introducing such a different way to handle locations and travelling.

It's not a hard quest but it's very unique, fun, and replayable.  Nightmare mode might be good with this one.

Looking forward to this one, especially since you say it's not that hard. How would you say it compares to Three Trials in solo?

Again, I haven't played it yet - and I am going to gorge tomorrow - but Three Trials was super easy! So I hope it's a little better than that! Typically we get a softball at the third and fourth quest so not surprising.

Three Trials easy in solo? Wow, I mean it's no Carn Dum, but I thought it was fairly difficult in single player, as you can't divide the guardians among players.

agreed!!  I've gotten lucky and beaten Carn Dum, but prob have 20 solo games against Three Trials without a win.

I stand by what I said. Three Trials was easy (for my deck obviously) in solo.

I was about to say, if you use Boromir it becomes 90% easier, but I was saying in a general sense.

Three Trials was harder. If anything this almost feels like Encounter at Amon Din to me, where the mechanic is very cool and makes up for the quest being a little bit easier. Like GrandSpleen said, Nightmare mode with this one is gonna be really cool.  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Proof of an easy quest every 3rd or 4th pack:

 

Shadows of Mirkwood: The Hills of Emyn Muil #4

Khazad-dum: The Long Dark #4

Against the Shadow: Encounter at Amon Din #3

No spoiler review...

This quest is long. I've played it twice now and both of them were slogs. The quest map mechanic is neat and I liked it, but the endless undead and treacheries from the encounter deck are the consequence of that. And frankly I'm still a bit tired of undead after Angmar. I know some of you really like them though. None of the treacherous really break your back, but catching the wrong one early without a cancel can make the game much harder.

And speaking of making things harder, read all the cards and the insert carefully. I took at least two extra turns because I forgot about the Gate Key ability.

Just about to play this for the first time, and somethings not quite clear to me from reading the rules insert - it says that when i travel away from the active location, after it has enough progress on it, i remove the progress and it is considered "explored". If i move back to that location later, is it still "explored", or do i need to put progress on it all over again?

## 175 [GrandSpleen on July 7, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/222753-temple-of-the-deceived/?do=findComment&comment=2299830)

It is still flipped over (you never flip it back to the Uncharted side) but it will have no progress on it, so you will have to put progress on it again.

Thanks, that's what I thought when I read it, I was just wondering if I was missing something about the "considered explored" part. Ah well, off to give it a try!

I've played this a few times now and would like to add to my comments.  In some ways this is the best mono-tactics quest to be released since we left Gondor.  There really is no chance of location lock because the number and threat from locations stays constant.  So even in tactics you can build up a team of questers in order to brave the perils of the island.  The encounter deck only consists of enemies (tactics forte) and treacheries which aren't too bad.

 

For my part I have really been enjoying the sailing quests, and this quest is probably the easiest one in the extended cycle so far, but if you like smashing undead with a red deck, it's probably for you.

Deorwine confuses me. I can't trigger him before revealing the shadow card because there's no "shadow effect" to cancel at this point. I can't trigger him when the shadow card is revealed because it's an Action not a Response. I can't trigger him after the shadow effect has resolved because cancellations have to be immediate. Unless he can only "cancel" persistent shadow effects like +1 Attack and not instant shadow effects like Deal 1 damage to the defender? Help!

Pretty much. Or they've mispritned action for repsonse.

I think it was clearly a misprint. The ability makes absolutely no sense unless it is a response. I'm sure it will receive errata.

I already asked Caleb about Deorwine:



> I believe Deorwine’s ‘Action’ should be a ‘Response’ to allow his ability to work as intended. His effect is meant to cancel the shadow effect after it is revealed and before it resolves in a similar fashion to Hasty Stroke.

We just used Elfhelm with lots of Songs and Love of Tales and Grima opposite a Tactics Eowyn / Tactics Aragorn / Spirit Beregond deck full of nice mounts. The results were highly entertaining. I wouldn't call it anywhere near the most efficient pairing we've ever done but it was certainly a load of fun. Eowyn questing for 5 and then attacking for 18 with Firefoot was a particular highlight. Didn't even need Gondorian Fire!

On several occasions now I have played a Rohan Warhorse on Spirit Eowyn when she was never going to attack.  +1 willpower for 1 resource isn't terrible.

Tried this first time today. I played with my Galadriel Cirdan Galdor Noldor that i have traveled the whole cycle. I won and it looked to me easy. But i hsve a couple of questions

When the Aimless wandering treachury appears, i look at the cards othogonicaly to the active location to make the effect?

Also on winding caverns location,what is the meaning of travel cost?

You don't look at the facedown side of a location in the staging area if it's UNcharted side faceup. While "facedown", you only consider the Lost Island/Temple of the Deceived side of it.

 

Travel costs are effects worded as "Travel: blablabla". You have to complete them in order to travel to the location. In this case, the Travel cost of Temple is that you have to exhaust the Gate Key. If you travel through the caverns to the Temple, it'sjust a reminder that you still have to actually exhaust the Key to go there.

About the aimless wandering treachury, Maybe i was not clear

I.e, the first card that i draw from the encounter deck is it, i am at top left, so one uncharted to the left and one to the bottom. I have to remove characters from quest till a willpower of four removed (as the treachury suggests) is reached? (Thats what i did, but want to be sure)

## 187 [Gizlivadi on August 15, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/222753-temple-of-the-deceived/?do=findComment&comment=2366455)

Ok, now I get it. No, the treachery does not suggest a willpower of 4. It says X, where X is the number of Uncharted locations. If you start at the top left and only have 2 uncharted locations in the staging area (one to the right and once below), you only have to remove characters with a total of 2 willpower.

I agree it was very difficult for me to beat, in fact i am not sure i have ever beaten in solo without tweaking the rules to remove the time penalties. I play one deck solo and hate building a deck which is totally specific to beating one scenario although i do build themed decks. Maybe that is why i am finding the Ringmaker cycle a rather disappointing experience for its high difficulty levels. It has rather put me off buying any more cycles at all now as they seem to have upped the difficulty well beyond the Dwarrowdelf levels. Note I didn't buy Numenor or that cycle as the theme didnt excite me. Maybe there are some more adventure like scenarios out there i would like and Temple looks like one of the better ones.

This is good to know - are there any other quests around which have a similar adventure theme style that are not in the overly difficult box. The ones i like are adventures rather than tricky puzzles to solve, my favourites include Khazad dum, Long Dark, Redhorn Gate, Watcher in the water, Spider themed ones. I am currently finding Ringmaker and Isengaard much less enjoyable than Dwarrowdelf. I want to like 3 trials but i have to rule tweak to make it work ok. I just hope to find a few more quests around that suit my adventure style. Mount Gram interested me and Rhudaur or Dread Realm but i wasnt sure if i could do them given my Ringmaker experiences.

My wife and I have been finding the Grey Havens + Dreamchaser cycle to be a bit easier on the whole than anything released since the Dwarrowdelf days. So far every quest has been a blast, too. I suspect that this would be a good cycle to skip to if you wanted to.

Escape from Mount Gram and Across the Ettenmoors are both really fun quests from the Angmar Awakened cycle, and neither of those are too difficult. The rest of that cycle is a little on the tough side though--but the player cards from that cycle are top notch.
