Hi everyone,

I'm not sure I get the travelling rule.

Let's say I've got two locations, I don't have any active ones, can  I choose to not travel and put my points toward the quest? or do I need to go to all the locations before  I can contribute to the main quest?

Thank you.

That's a very confusing question which suggest you might got wrong more rules than one.

The progress during quest phase is first placed on active location, and then if there any progress left - it is placed on the current quest.

During travel phase, if you have no active location, you may travel to a location from the staging area. You are not obliged to. You can't travel if you already have active location.

oh! I didn't know the excess progress went to the quest! Thank for that!

So if I understand correctly, let's say I choose to not travel to a location and I don't have any active location, I produce 6 progress tokens, the location has got 2 "threat", so I'm allowed to do 6-2 and put the 4 progress tokens onto the quest?

If you have no active location, all progress made during the quest phase goes on the current quest.

yes, your scenario is correct. You don't have to travel to a location but it helps to remove threat from the staging area.

It still sounds like you're trying to travel between questing and placing progress. What happens is during the quest phase, you place progress on any active location -- if there is one -- then on the current quest. THEN, you move to the travel phase and decide whether or not to travel, but only if there is not already an active location.
