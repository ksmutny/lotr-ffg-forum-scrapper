So, I have a question, Do you lay a shadow card down on the encounter every phase or just the first phase? ie. you have the hill troll out there and you don't kill him. now the next round or phase he is still there, does he get a new shadow card on him again before you do combat?

thank you

in the combat phase of every round, each engaged enemy receives one shadow card. [page 18]

thank you very much for your reply, so know this leads to the next question. If I build a deck of 50 cards using two different Spheres, can I attach an attachment that is not the same sphere to one of my heroes. ie. I have eowin and i want to attach the horn of gondor even tho they are two different spheres can I do it?

Definitely can.  It's in the FAQ and the discussion is on page 9 from memory

 You can even put an attachment on a hero controlled by another player.

You need to pay for the attachment with the resources of heroes of the same sphere as it, but then you can put it on any hero (if there are no restriction on the card).

A related question - Dol Guldur Beastmaster says you deal him an additional Shadow card AFTER he attacks.  Does this mean you resolve his first attack with 1 shadow card as normal, but then he gets an extra card dealt to him to be available for next round?

No it means after he attacks you add a shadow card to him so he has two per attack. Makes him quite nasty depending on what cards come up.

Please check the forum posts.  This is already being discussed many times in many other threads.

The jury is currently out with people currently arguing both sides and referring to cards in other languages to help make a decision.
