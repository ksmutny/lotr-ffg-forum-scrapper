The goblins are all like "oh hi, I'm here.  I'm just gonna hang out here in the staging area with my friends."

I would also put money on seeing the third Dwarrowdelf announcement this week.

All I gotta say is that is the Khazad-dum expansion.  There better be a friggin' BALROG in this expansion.  I will be *extremely* disappointed if there isn't....

there will most likely be, but i expect it will be an objective card i.e. escape the balrog

That would be incredibly lame.  We should see a full blown ENEMY card you have to "duke it out" with....  Otherwise, LAME....  At least IMHO.

Well, it sounds like (from the mysteriously lost french summary of the Dwarrodelf cycle) that the Balrog will make an appearance in the last Dwarrodelf pack. That makes me think there might NOT be a Balrog in the Khazad-dum expansion. However, we did see two versions of Gollum...

## 12 [richsabre on December 5, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57171-got-to-love-preview-monday/?do=findComment&comment=564218)

ah yes, now i think it may not be in there..it would seem like an anti climax to fight/flee the balrog only to have 6 packs of adventure around moria without any sight of it again

Love it too Rich. These spoilers are so entertaining...and they just keep getting better!

 As much as I am looking forward to all the new player cards, I am really excited about some of the new encounter deck mechanics we have seen. The ideas of ambush, locations that are harmful in the staging area, and synergy with different keywords like 'dark' or 'underground' are all going to improve this game as a whole.

## 15 [DurinIII on December 5, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57171-got-to-love-preview-monday/?do=findComment&comment=564269)

Definitely Puzzle. The new player cards still have to be my favorite part of the game, but these new encounter cards (along with their mechanics) look amazing!

Santa reading letters looks at one of his elf assistants: "What's a 'Khazad Dum'?"

Elf shrugs: "Maybe it's one of those video game thingies?"

As one of the five wizards, I'm sure Santa knows all about Khazad-dum.  It's been on his naughty list ever since the Dwarves awoke the nameless fear...
