 The quest does seem near impossible to beat purely solo. I have tried multiple decks against and have come close to beating half of it.

the problem with the quest is that it has the intensity of threat, locations and enemies of such a level that a usual quest would only have one of those aspects- ie. really hard locations or enemies….this has it ALL…..right from turn 1

I hope so. They've set a standard, One would hope they keep it. Altogether I see 43 quest points (only the left-hand card in the bottom two roads has duplicates, right?). So when a location is explored, those points remove damage from Lake-Town, right? So a total of 43 points of damage may be healed (in this manner) from Lake-Town?

That sounds like it might make the quest a little easier (laughable, I know), because of quest/heal points from locations.

You make it sound like it is a cake walk… trust me it isn't… it is hard to accumulate those and fight off Smaug and try to keep the town alive.

I know it's no cakewalk, that's why I said a "little easier" and then called my comment "laughable." I look forward to owning this set, but I'm not sure about playing the quest itself. It has to be the most difficult to date (although from what others are saying about The Hobbit I and Shadow and Flame, I'm not sure which is worst.

I have the full set from Gencon, I will try to take some pics of the other cards later tonight or tomorrow.  The difficulty of this quest is off the charts.  We got smoked every time we attempted it at Gencon.  

As others have said, dealing with the questing difficulty while trying to battle Smaug is insane.  You need an army of allies to feed him right from turn one.  It is not uncommon for Smaug to make instant attacks against all players during the quest phase of the first turn.

I look on the quest and encounter cards and it look really cool. But i dont understand 2 things

1 Resolve burn damage. What is mean?? I must to put this number f damage to the lake-town or???

2 Smaug had his own deck. So when you revealed him from this deck???

yes….location cards have Burn X on them….smaug and treachery cards will say resolve all burn damage in play

so if you have cards in play that amount to 5 burn damage, 5 damage goes on lake town

smaug has his own deck which you reveal seperate from the encounter deck. you have to state where he will go- staging area or engage you, then you draw him

basically you want to choose engage every turn….all smaugs have 7 ish threat so it gets tough with all the locations to quest

sure

-during set up, set up the smaug deck which consists of all the smaug enemy cards, shuffle them

-the smaug deck has its own discard pile. effects that interact with the encounter deck/discard pile do not interact with the smaug deck/discard pile

-when smaug is discarded place it in the smaug discard pile. if the smaug deck is empty reshuffle the discard pile to make a new smaug deck

 

-at the beginning of the quest phase the 1st player must choose either:

1.his play area

or

2.the staging area

as the destination of smaug. then reveal the top card of the smaug deck and put it into play- either in 1 or 2 depending on what you choose.

if you chose 1 then smaug immediatly engages you.

-if another version of smaug was already in play (i.e after round 1) then move all damage from the previous version to the new version of smaug and discard the previous smaug.

 

BURN X is the burn numbers on the card in play. when told to resolve all burn damage, total the amount of burn damage in play and assign it to lake town.

when doing this each player may exhaust any number of his characters to assign any number of of burn damage to those characters, up to their remainging hit points.

any damage not dealt in this way is assigned to lake town

PS- there is a location that allows you to have two active locations at once- i think its the warf….i dont know how to officially play this as it isnt mentioned anywhere.

Ok we play with Kobby 2 game against this quest. First we terrible lost and second one we won. I like this quest is much better done then SOF but MAO is still the best in my opinion. MAO is going to be more difficult with the number of players Lake-city i think is going more easy instead.

I use Glorifindel(FOS), Beravur and Aragorn and Kobby have Elrond, Bofur and Eowyn deck.Both of us use spirit and Lot of Test of will and Dwarfen tomb cose there a lot of nasty when revealed and shadow effects.

And also Lake-town is more  static ques then MAO. In MAO last stage can bring you lot of surprise (cose of Massing in Osgiliatn threachery or Captain effect) here is everything more monotony and if you are reach a certain point the encounter deck cannot do nothing against you(little bit remind me SAF).But still this one really cool quest and quite difficult as well. This quest take a lot time to win. And I really love the idea of Dragon deck! Smaug is flying around the city and you never know where he will going next round and what he will do. Really interesting quest and very, very difficult for solo play i suppose.

If "burning" becomes a decently common mechanic in LOTR LCG then I hope FFG will include burning tokens in a future Deluxe Expansion, like the ones used in Warhammer: Invasion possibly.

i think is an extreme example as participants had to register as a couple, so it was tailored to be this hard.

id be really surprised if we ever got something as relatively brutal as this…..unless we were storming the dark tower with a feather duster or whatever

 Wow, if I didn´t make some mistakes due to not having the rules for this pack and only using the stuff I found on this forum I have just beaten Smaug. 

I made a print out copy and decided to try my dwarf solo deck for one quick try……wasn´t that quick in the end.

 

Used Dain, Ori and Bifur. Final threat was at 47. Laketown had no damage on it. I got SoG and Dunedain Warning in my opening hand.

After fighting for 4 rounds to stay in the game ( in one round my threat went up by 6 ) I managed to get a solid Dain with BB, 2 Warnings, Ring Mail and 

a Daugter. The Master of the Forge and a Record Keeper helped a lot. And after building up my army and having Dain to block 3 times a turn if needed, it was just a matter of time.

I decided to not damage Smaug till the very end.

And man was I lucky to get the Great Bridge when Lake Town had only 3 damage on it….. Getting this in mid game when I had 38 damage on it would have been a disaster.

Very hard to manage the threat in the early rounds of the game……..

If you play this quest first time you will lose more then 90%. But when you understand the idea so then you can win. Smaug is the key in this deck.

If you have manage his attack you done. Problem is Smaug is moving around a lot and you never know what can happen next turn. SO you must to have hevy defense hero to be able deal with a Smaug. But Smaug can attack more then 2 times and more then 1 players in 1 round in quest phase and combat phase. And sometimes thank to shadow effect he can attack twice in the row. But if you can manage his attack you will win is only matter of time. But is really hard to manage his attack that is a problem. You must to have tank hero like Dain or Elrond.

Wow is cool to win this quest in the first try. I still cannot make it solo for now. Won only 2 players game and this was really hard.

Burt as i say from the certain point quest is become monotony cose if you can manage Smaug attack there is only matter of time to win for sure. Still is not easy to do without certain heroes.

Can you confirm that first player choose where to play Smaug at the beginning of the quest phase (either put it on the staging area or in play area, engaged) ?

So you always know where it will fly, do you?

 I just tried this on OCTGN, very hard solo without knowing what's coming up. I'm looking forward to trying 2-player.

The "immune to player card effects" raised an interesting question, muemakan mentioned burning brand and I'm not sure how that would work for smaug, he is, after all, immune to all player card effects and I can't beleive he is really scared by a fiery stick.

Thoughts?

Thoughts?



Since Burning Brand targets the shadow effects on cards, not the enemy itself, it should still work.  While CONTEXTUALLY I agree that Smaug would not be frightened by a flaming stick (he does breathe fire after all), per the wroding/text, Burning Brand actually has no interaction with him directly.  He is merely the conduit for a shadow card that Burning Brand can cancel.

100% right

There's no denying that Burning brand doesn't target Smaug so I'm happy to agree on that part however that is only a part of the definition of the term ….

Cards with the text "immune to player card effects" ignore the effects of all player cards. Additionally, cards that are immune to player card effects cannot be chosen as targets of player card effects

I'm finding it hard to justify that a burning brand doesn't effect Smaug. Let's say the shadow card dealt to Smaug was Esgaroth Wharf

Attacking enemy gets +2 [Attack]. Then it makes an additional attack after this one.

The defender has a burning brand

While attached character is defending, cancel any shadow effects on cards dealt to the attacking enemy.

Smaug will "ignore the effects of all player cards", so he will ignore the "cancel any shadow effects" from the Burning Brand and therefore the shadow effect will trigger giving Smaug +2 and another attack.

Not to be contentious (that means I will be), but that's an incorrect interpretation.  I stick to my original point.  Since the Burning Brand's effect is a constant effect while it is in play (unless altered by some other card that negaets it's text), it still cancels even an attack boost.  The shadow effects are a keyword (Shadow:), that are triggered.  In this case, BB is NOT negating an attack bonus of Smaug's:  the bonus does not originate from him, but the shadow card.  Therefore, before it can even technically be considered an attack boost, it is already canceled by BB.  If the bonus had been printed on Smaug as a "give Smaug +2 attack if dealt a shadow card with a Shadow effect", then you would be correct, since his "immune to player card effect" would prevent a bonus being blocked since it originated from his text.  But if your interpretation is correct, then BB vs Smaug would be a VERY confusing conundrum indeed, as you would constantly have to be determining WHICH shadow effects qualified as a Smaug-boost, and which were just "normal".

Nope, BB cancels ALL shadow effects, plain and simple.  For once, FFG's wording is pretty clear and concise gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]

I don't really mind how "immune to player card effects" is ruled in the end however I will enjoy a good discussion in the mean time happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]

A burning brand says "cancel any shadow effects", I guess I'm interpreting that to mean that the shadow text is resolved and then burning brand cancels any effects that it might have had. i.e. It still triggers (Smaug get +2 Attack and another attack) and then BB cancels that effect, then Smaug ignores the effect of the player card (A burning Brand) meaning it is not cancelled after all.

Does Smaug with (ignore the effects of all player cards) trump A Burning Brand (cancel any shadow effects).

I'm not sure if there is anything in the rules to help answer that one. I suspect FFG will need to clarify exactly what "ignore the effects of all player cards" really means. For a start it makes sense that it only ignores effects that interact with Smaug but where do you draw the line?

i asked this, and posted about it, on another thread when it comes to locations that are immune to player effects; my guess is it works the same way as it does here.

Dain - which thread is that?

In the mean time I've sent the following question to the rules team ….

I have a query about how to interpret "immune to player card effects", I suspect this phasing will be used again (i.e. Beorn) and I'm not sure how far reaching the phrase 'Cards with the text "immune to player card effects" ignore the effects of all player cards.' really is.

Here's a scenario
Smaug (the battle for laketown) attacks and the revealed shadow card is Esgaroth Wharf (Shadow: Attacking enemy gets +2 att, then it makes an additional attack after this one).

The defender has a burning brand.
"While attached character is defending, cancel any shadow effects on cards dealt to the attacking enemy."

So Smaug gets +2 att from the shadow effect then burning brand cancels this effect. No problems so far …. but what happens next?
Option 1: Smaug's immunity means he ignores the effect of a burning brand, meaning that the shadow card is not cancelled.
Option 2: Smaug's immunity does not affect the burning brand because <some reasonable reason here>.

What if the defender has a Dunedain warning (+1 Def), will the defender still get the bonus?
What if I attack Smaug with a character with a Rivendell Blade, does Smaug get -2 Def? What happens if I cast Heavy Stroke on an attacker on Smaug, will it ignore the effect (the extra damage)?

In order to answer these questions and possibly lots more in a similar vein, I think I/we need a better definition of "immune to player card effects" that clearly describes the extent (or range) of this trait, one that works for Smaug and Beorn and any future cards with this trait.

Hi Matthew,
Good question. You can play attachments on locations that are immune to player card effects. If a card cannot have attachments, then it will read "Cannot have attachments." However, cards that are immune to player card effects will be immune to the abilities of attachments. So you can play Power in the Earth on the Troll Cave, but it will have no effect on that location. Card like Ancient Mathom and Path of Need work differently because they don't affect the location, so their abilities will still work.
Thanks for asking,
Caleb

I still think my interpretation is justified… gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]
But I am interested to see if they have an official ruling that addesses the issue…

Again, since BB does NOT interact with Smaug (but the shadow card directly, which happens BEFORE any bonuses would be applied), there is nothing for him to ignore.

Memetix said:

THIS one IS a great question that I could see going either way.  The defense boost doesn't target Smaug specifically, but since he IS engaged/attacking directly to the defender, I could see the defense boost being negated.

Memetix said:

Because the -2 Def would target Smaug, then here he absolutely would ignore the text of the blade (this would also negate the text of a card like Mirkwood Runner, IMO)

These last couple questions do seem like much better examples of when Smaug's "immunity" would either be definitely in effect, or at least questionably so…

 

Good thoughts!

## 52 [Memetix on September 11, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69763-smaug-location-piccys-beautiful/?do=findComment&comment=691617)

I've had a reply from Caleb and then a quick email exchange to confirm my understanding.

First reply from Caleb

Smaug's immunity does not affect shadow cards, it only protects him from card effects. Burning brand targets the shadow cards and not Smaug, so it still works. The +1 defense from Dunedain Warning modifies the attached character, not Smaug, so it still works. An example of cards that wouldn't work against his immunity to card effects would be Radagast's Cunning or Feint because they try to modify Smaug.


 

I then asked

In the Hobbit expansion it defines the term "immune to player card effects" as.
Cards with the text "immune to player card effects" ignore the effects of all player cards. Additionally, cards that are immune to player card effects cannot be chosen as targets of player card effects

If I've understood you correctly, the first sentence isn't correct. Smaug doesn't ignore the effects of all player cards. If he did, he would ignore the effects of a Dunedain warning on a defender. Actually he only ignores the effects of player cards that would directly affect him.
So Rivendell blade won't lower his defense, Mirkwood runner will not get around his defense and Heavy Stroke can't add more damage to him because they would all affect him and he is immune to those effects.
Dunedain warning on a defender affects how much damage the defender will take and therefore is not ignored as it doesn’t affect Smaug, it affects the defender.

If I've got that right then a clearer definition could be

Player card effects can neither target nor affect cards with the text "immune to player card effects".

Is that right?
 

And the reply was

What you described in your example accurately describes how Smaug's immunity interacts with the game.

I'm happy that I now understand the term and even though Caleb didn't comment on my updated definition of the term I will be using it from now on when interacting with Smaug (and Beorn).

Player card effects can neither target nor affect cards with the text "immune to player card effects".

Not a dumb question.

 

At the moment they are not available. But if they follow the same as they did with last year's senario at GenCon, then it should be available by the end of this year/stat of next as a print on demand.

 

Look for Massing at Osgiliath
