Quick questions: can you go into negatives on threat or is the meter always minimized at zero? Also, can you have a negative score before rounds are totaled in? For example, I have a total threat of 2, 1 damage, no dead, and 5 vp, making -2. Is that legitimate?

I believe that you cannot have negative threat, but you can have a negative score. Not sure off the top of my head that there are explicit rules statements to back this up though.

Not possible!

Also FFG changed the scoring system in their FAQ. If you go to the support page you´ll find a link. You add 10 points for each completed round at the end of the refresh phase.
