Does the text on the Fate of Balin card mean you add additional encounter cards beyond what you would normally stage (e.g. you would basically double-up the encounter cards)?

Thanks.

Effectively yes, except only Enemies are kept, rest are ignored.

Ahh, last time we played this quest, we assume that since it used the word "reveal", we resolved every "when revealed" effect (even the ones on Treacheries!).  Seems that we have given ourselves a hard time llorando.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/llorando.gif]

From the card:

Forced: At the end of the staging step, reveal the top X cards of the encounter deck, adding all enemies to the staging area. Discard the other revealed cards without resolving them. X is the number of players.
If the players defeat this stage, they win the game. 
 

Are the enemies considered revealed, for Thalins ability?

 "When Revealed" Effects
A card is only considered to be revealed if the card or
game effect causing the card to enter play specifically
uses a form of the word "reveal".


Example: If the players use the Stage 3b "Don't Leave
the Path!" (CORE 121) quest card effect to search for a
King Spider and put it into play, the "When Revealed"
effect on the King Spider will not trigger, since the
effect on "Don't Leave the Path!" does not specifically
use a form of the word "reveal."

Well this is a 2 edge sword.. if that is the text it says "REVEAL" this means all "when revealed effects" will trigger.. so all treacheries for example will resolve.

As for Thalin's ability is active "while commited to the quest" so while at home I play that his ability only triggers during the quest phase BEFORE you place tokens.. technically (and really badly imo) the official rules state that the character is committed to the quest until the travel phase… So ANY when revealed cards that are monsters would get a wound token as this is all happening before the travel phase…

Wow, that is so awesome. Think I'll give Thalin another chance after all.

… except the GT specifically states to " Discard the other revealed cards without resolving them".  In my mind, the treachery cards would also be ignored, as that IS their resolution.
