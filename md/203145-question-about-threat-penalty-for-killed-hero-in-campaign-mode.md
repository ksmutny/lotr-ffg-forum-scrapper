So, according to the campaign rules, if I lose a hero, then I am allowed to add in a different hero, but all players get a +1 penalty.  If, later, that Hero comes back to life (with Beyond All Hope), then I can swap that hero back in without an (additional) +1 penalty.  

 

Here's the question - was my original +1 penalty for there being a dead hero (in which case I would no longer have any penalty, as I no longer have a dead hero), or for swapping heroes (in which case I would still have a +1 penalty, though I'm back to my original team, since I haven't undone the fact that I swapped heroes to a non-dead one earlier)?
