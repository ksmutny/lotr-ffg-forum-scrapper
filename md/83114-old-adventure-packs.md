I'm fairly new to the game so I'm not exactly sure how FF usuals deals with this, but older adverture packs like Hunt for Gollum, etc are basically impossible to find. Will these ever be re-printed or is somone like me out of luck?

 

thanks

there are planned reprints…if you go to the 'upcoming' page on this site they should be there….not sure of the timescale though

I'm in the same boat. I've been able to find A Journey to Rhosgobel, The Hills of Emyn Muil, and Return to Mirkwood in the U.S. I just ordered The Dead Marshes from a store in the U.K. for about $20, including shipping. The Hunt for Gollum and Conflict at the Carrock are nowhere to be found (unless you want to pay >$50).

Scheduled reprints are shown here:

The Hunt for Gollum, A Journey to Rhosgobel, and Return to Mirkwood are scheduled for reprints in Q2 2013.
