I've committed a hero to a quest. In the staging step, Sacked! is revealed. I attach it to the hero that has committed, so that he cannot commit to a quest.  Is he stil considered committed to a quest now?

I say yes he is stillcommited to the Quest. Next turn though he cannot commit...that is the way we play!

 He cannot commit to a quest, which happens at the beginning of the Quest phase.  Since he's already committed, he stays committed.
