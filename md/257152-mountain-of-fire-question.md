Was just wondering if anyone knows how long it usually takes for the gen con released product to hit retail?

Being in uk and seeing people with it is torture :/ I can't wait to get my hands on it

Any info os appreciated :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

It generally can take several months (3?) so don't be too hurry :/. But it can also be released in 2 weeks all over the world, we never really know :/

I'm UK as well Chris. I don't think it'll be 3 months though. Its been "on the boat" for a while so hopefully we'll get it pretty quickly.

I mean, Land of Shadow it was ages between GenCon and the wider release. But then as I recall Flame of the West actually turned up in UK stores the day before GenCon, so really, who knows?
