I'm new to this game and need some help finding a place to find card lists for each expansion. Is there a site that you all use? Thanks!

Hallofbeorn.com will waste more of your time than you'll care to admit.

Like this a lot. Go to "Cards" on the top tabs and then choose the set. Then you can either look at the list or view the list as full cards or spoilers etc.

Another good site is Deckbauer [http://deckbauer.telfador.net/products.html&gameid=1], it's in german and english.

cardgamedb is an official support site and also a good place to ask card specific questions.

Hallofbeorn and ringsdb (both mentioned above) are well-known and generally awesome sites (ringsdb also has a very solid deckbuilder and a lot of very good decks to browse).

While not providing card lists, http://lotr-lcg-quest-companion.com/ [http://lotr-lcg-quest-companion.com/] is worth looking at if you don't know about it.
