Another noobish question (sorry... I think I have one hundred more...). The turn sequence scheme, as reported on pag 30 of the core rules, says that

 

"green: any player can take any actions generally, or between the game steps stated in the rules"

 

This rule is not 100% clear to me. Allow me to go with an example:

 

Quest phase, step one: players commit characters to quest

 

it has a green background, so I read this as:

 

"any time, while committing characters to a quest, I'm allowed to play event cards. So, for instance, I can use Sneak attack to play Gandalf and have him questing; at the end of the quest phase, he returns to my hand"

 

Is this reading correct?

 

The thing that confuses me is looking at the structure of the Planning Phase: if my reading is correct, then what's the need of the two green "player action" boxes? I understand the need to use boxes to show that playing players actions is legit between bullet point 2 and 4 of the Quest phase, but why between bullet point 1 and 3 of the Planning Phase? Being both bullet point 1 and 3 of the planning phase green, it should be automatic that you can play actions whenever you want. Or?

 

Thanks for help

Box are preaty.

You're playing it right, don't bother. (yes, you can sneak attack gandalf and commit him to quest)

Also, it may be because player 1 is the only one to play ally and attachement, and then it is player 2 turn, etc... so player 1 cannot play attachement on player 2 ally that enter play the same turn. But this does not prevent player 2 to play event action during player 1's turn.

 

Also, note that player, one by one, declare all there commiting characters. You can't play action when player X is choosing a character and then another, only before and after he decided all his characters.

Indeed. Importance of first player token and sequence of declarations were clear to me, but thanks for the reminder (one more confirmation never hurts)

 

Good to know I was playing it correctly, thanks a million for the answer :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
