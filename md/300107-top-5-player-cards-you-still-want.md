# [Top 5 player cards you still want](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/300107-top-5-player-cards-you-still-want/)

## 1 [RebelX on September 16, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/300107-top-5-player-cards-you-still-want/?do=findComment&comment=3786135)

In April I made a threat about the 5 heroes everybody wants to see before the game ends. At that time we would anticipate that moment to come so soon. With 2 packs of the presumed last cycle spoiled for the most parts, we only have about 50 mystery cards left. So would like to know what you think should be addressed in terms of player cards ( EXCLUDING HEROES). I will try to settle for a Top5 but feel free to do a Top 10 or Top5 per sphere if you feel the need.

 

I am an elf guy, so don't be suprised:

1. Good non-unique Noldor questing ally preferably Lore or Spirit: while I consider most unique Noldor allys to be great, I cannot say the same for the rest. I like the Guardian of Rivendell and obviously the Stargazer is great but in non-sailing quests the upkeep of the navigator is steep for non-Erestor decks.

2. Good Noldor ally in Leadership: I really hope they make the Gildor AP the Noldor AP. Right now I not see many compelling reasong to play leadership with Noldor. Erestor is good (nowadays a bit overcosted) and I guess the Warden can work but there is just not much more. A great toy for Gildor and an ally with stable-potential would go a long way.

3. Lore weapon for Silvan: Forged has gone a long way to help Noldor to get weapons on Glorfindel and their other heroes. Silvan should also get some help here as they have two green heroes that would benefit greatly from a +2 attack weapon. It could even have a cost of 2. 

 

4. /5.Green/red silvan events: We still miss 2 for the collection. It would be cool if the green one was for interacting with the victory display or healing. Red one could be stat-boosting.

Honorably mentioned: Ally Aragorn. Sphere would not matter, but as we will likely get Spirit Aragorn hero, this won't happen. 

Dunedin support: Just 2-3 true difference-maker would be great.

Neutral ally aragorn would be great!

 

Usual stat line with hp down to 4 or 3, a decent ability and a cost of 3.

1) Honestly, I would prefer ally Aragorn over a spirit hero version. Is there any reason to believe, we will get spirit Aragorn anyway? Additionally I would like more allies of important characters like Éomer, Éowyn, Théoden, Frodo, Fatty, Gríma, Beregond, Targon, Bergil, Dáin Ironfoot etc.

2) Furthermore, I would like to see some way for dwarves to become ranged, like a Throwing Axe attachment, or a ranged dwarven ally. Dúnedain Signal or Elf-friend plus Rivendell bow is unthematic.

3) Some dwarven healing would be nice as well. Sure they have a lot of hitpoints, but I do not like to always rely on Wardens of Healing for that task.

4) Extra cards for Isengard/Doomed could enable a Isengard deck to work. Right now there is not much in terms of allies and the events can be used in many deck types.

## 4 [Felswrath on September 16, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/300107-top-5-player-cards-you-still-want/?do=findComment&comment=3786248)

I just got Steward's Fear and now have all the Outlands cards. The archetype can certainly be very powerful, but I have come across some short comings, therefore I came up with an idea for some unique Outlands  allies that can contribute to the deck, but are hopefully not either too overpowered or too overcosted. These allies will clearly not come to the game simply because we're getting them as Gondor allies this cycle.

Angbor - Lore Cost 4 (unique)

Ouitlands

1 Willpower

1 Attack

1 Defense

2 Hitpoints

You may not play Angbor if there is another copy of him in your discard pile.

Response: After Angbor enters play, draw x cards. x is the number of Outlands allies in play.

Derufin - Tactics Cost 4 (unique)

Outlands

1 Willpower

1 Attack

1 Defense

2 Hitpoints

You may not play Derufin if there is another copy of him in your discard pile.

Response: After Derufin enters play, deal x damage to an enemy. x is the number of Outlands allies in play.

Duilin - Spirit Cost 4 (unique)

Outlands

1 Willpower

1 Attack

1 Defense

2 Hitpoints

You may not play Duilin if there is another copy of him in your discard pile.

Response: After Duilin enters play, reduce your threat by x. x is the number of Outlands allies in play.

Bergil - Spirit Cost 1 (unique)

Gondor

1 Willpower

0 Attack

0 Defense

1 Hitpoint

Action: You may shuffle Bergil into your deck to ready a hero.

Gondorian Refugees - Spirit Cost 3 

Gondor

1 Willpower

0 Attack

2 Defense

3 Hitpoints

While this ally is in play, your threat is counted as 3 fewer.

Forced: Damage from undefended attacks must be assigned to Gondorian Refugees.

My top five would be:

5. Bergil ally/hero card that interacts with Pippin and Beregond in some fashion.

4. Better Barliman Butterbur ally, maybe in spirit this time. Same stats, something like:  Response: After an enemy card has been revealed, exhaust Barliman to increase its engagement cost by 5 for each Hobbit hero you control. (in hobbit deck basically avoid an enemy, in one hobbit deck should also work as supporting pillar)

3. I feel like the game still needs a solid alternative for other spheres for Unexpected Courage. UC lacks the restrictions that armored destrier, fast hitch, armored warhorse etc have. Would probably be boring but would help balance, something like 3 cost tactics UC. Or maybe a 0 cost UC in leadership that you need to pay 1 for using.

2.  Spirit Aragorn, obviously, everyone loves Aragorn and i'm no exception.

1. Most importantly, a character i've been awaiting for 8 years or something, Gandalf the White. I know the naming controversy, but i will repeat myself over and over Gandalf the White is a really different character and deserves his own card. Add a sentence that doesn't let you play heroes or allies named "Gandalf" and you have "Gandalf the White" working. I can see him as a ridiculously powerful hero or first 7 or 8 cost ally. Whatever they do with him, i WANT HIM

I honestly think they need a max limit of like 4 or 5 or they are pretty broken at least the one with card draw and threat reduction.

I like the refugees

I've thought a lot about Gandalf the White. My main desire for him is to have a Gandalf that reflects his rallying ability and complement Narya and similar abilities. 

Gandalf - (unique) Lore

Threat 14

Willpower 3

Attack 3

Defense 3

Hitpoints 5

Istari

Setup: Search your deck for a Neutral Song attachment. Add it to your hand.

Response: After Gandalf exhausts from a player card effect, spend 1 resource from his resource pool and raise your threat by 1 to choose 1: Add x resources to another hero's resource pool; or Choose a player to draw x cards. x is the number of resource icons Gandalf possess.

I want an event that readies attachments.

I don't care how badly it breaks the game.

 

We wants it....

- First and foremost, Saruman hero

- Blue Wizards neutral allies

- New, unique Palantiri

- More artifacts/arts of the enemy/doomed support

- Goldberry encounter ally, although that's already probably coming.

I want Saruman hero.

 

Speaking of which, I recently noticed that if Saruman were to ever portrayed again, Charles Dance seems to be a very good fit.

Spirit Aragorn, just because it bothers me that he's represented in 3 out of 4 spheres. I need them to make one more for my sanity.

I'd love an Eomer and/or Eowyn ally

Also, converting the saga Anduril into an attachment for Aragorn.

Only 5 and no heroes eh? Let's do one for each sphere and neutral

Lore - Huorn - 3 cost ally that you place into the staging area and you can exhaust to deal 1 damage to an enemy that is placed in the staging area to replicate their part in The Battle of Helm's Deep, a forest that destroys enemies that enter them. Could also have a similar effect with when an enemy engages you exhaust to deal 1 damage but I like the idea of a staging area Ally for something a bit different and thematic.

Tactics- Stone Giant, Gandalf did say there were good Giants, so would be cool to see one. Maybe starts with Toughness 1 and when he enters play discard or put out of play a non-unique active location to show him "stopping up a Gobilin hole.

Spirit - Fembrithel or a generic Entwife, even as an objective ally would be pretty cool to see and finally let our Ent friends find their spouses. Some kind of effect to exhaust to search the top 5 cards of your deck for an Ent and put it into play.

Leadership - Bergil, Gondorian unique ally that could not be able to attack or defend but have the effect "Response: When a Gondorian ally is defeated return Bergil to his owner's hand to put that ally back into play, with 1 damage token on it so he could help with some keep some of those costly Gondorian allies in play.

Neutral (or Spirit if we don't get our hero version) - Aragorn, it's about time we got an Aragorn ally to fill the role of missing Fellowship allies. He could be Spirit or Leadership and grant +1 Willpower to heroes and have the effect that if your threat rises above 40 he loses the ally type and gains the hero type.

Spirit Aragorn and Lore Arwen heroes that play nice together.

Unique Noldor that heals.  I want one that can make an all Noldor Fellowship.  (Not Ioreth.)

For the last two, make Dunedain good solo.  (Without using Damrod.)

## 15 [General_Grievous on September 17, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/300107-top-5-player-cards-you-still-want/?do=findComment&comment=3786891)

I may also add if there was something each trait needed:

 

Eagles - Eagle healer and maybe one that goes searching for tactics events/attachments that have Eagle art on them hahaha. Or an 

Ents - Location clearing Ent like the Saga one. Also Ent-wife hero!!! Come on FFG female heroine!

Dunedain - an ally or trap that can blank an engaged enemies abilities to take out archery and other nastiness. Or even one that can do something even a small something to enemies that can't have attachements. Call it some kind of Mine (or exlpoding acorn! Haha) that can deal damage to an enemy that is immune to attachments when an enemy is added to the staging area.

Dwarves - Miner that heals as he mines? Or that can forge new armour/weapons for his kin.

Gondor - Ally to save allies like Gamling is to Rohan.

Rohan - Another ally Mount specific to Rohan allies that lets them attack into staging area.

Silvin - Condtion removal "healer" or trechary cancellation unique one.

Noldor - Celebrimbor's Ghost! Haha Or some kind of ring-forger that can search a deck for a ring.

Dale - Trader that searches your deck do an attachment when he enters play.

Hobbit - Frodo Ally that is similar to his spirit version raising your threat by 1 to cancel a damage. 

Isenguard/Doomed - Ok they really need a hero Saruman here to make it all mesh together and allow him to gain other benefits from doomed player cards like readying, resources and card draw.

Outlands - attachment that lets a Gondor unique Spirit Gondor hero gain Outlands trait since they clearly missed it on Lothiriel.

Secrecy - Card draw resourceful equivalent.

-Two or less heroes Readying attachment that lets it attack back an enemy that attacks it.

Beorning - Honey patch that lets them cancel a damage each round. Actually locations in general would be sweet for lo traits and races, may no be the most thematic or maybe something being tied into next years "product shift" but locations would be sweet and really add some more drama if you had a main one you had to defend and smaller forward posistions, Siege weapons and shops/stables you could put into play.

Neutral/Other - Stome Giants, Huorns, and Army of the Dead spirits.

Actually, probably better in the fellowship contract. You may well have resources left over after you get your fellowship set up.

Lorefindel, Elrond, Arwen as a hero lineup?  With the twins, Erestor, Galdor, Lindir, and Gildor as the other 6 uniques?

It's not going to be a rapid setup, but it could be very powerful once it gets going. Could run Cirdan instead of Elrond, but you lose on his boost to Glorfindel's healing.

To this point, with the recent release of The One Ring, Gollum, Tom Bombadil and probably Wilyador, my short-list of wanted cards have insanely dwindled. I will start with what I don't want to see:

- To this point of the game's life with so few cards remaining, I would hate seeing some duplicates (with the one exception). So **** no for new Arwens or Barlimans or whatever

- No Gandalf the White. Gandalf became the White because he fought the Balrog. The Boon "Beyond All Hope" attached to Gandalf is Gandalf the White

Soooooo:

1. Spirit Aragorn, like every one else

2. The Blue Wizards, though I suspect we won't get them

3. Saruman hero

Then it's ok, we have basically everything we need

What's this saga anduril people are talking about? The only narsil/anduril card I know of is "Sword That Was Broken." I don't see any Anduril in ringsdb. To me that's the #1 missing card from the game.

Anduril shows up in the saga campaign as a boon card - I don't think those show up in RingsDB. It costs 3 resources, gives attached hero +1 to all stats, and gives the response "after attached hero defends against an enemy attack, exhaust anduril to declare attached hero as an attacker against that enemy."

Just that he should be because we already have him in the other spheres and he is  a perfect fit for the description of what the rules say the spirit sphere represents.

 Spirit Ê: The sphere of spirit emphasizes the strength of a hero’s will, particularly that hero’s determination, resilience, courage, loyalty, and heart.   

Otherwise nope, nothing to suggest he is a lock.  I have figured for a while now that since leadership Aragorn was the first hero (card #1), that we would get the spirit version as the last hero released.  

An ally Aragorn also NEEDS to happen though.

Player encounter cards which are enemies, locations or treacheries.  They would have a regular player card event to put them into the encounter deck (like ranger summons), but instead of just giving you a new player card when they come up and then surging, they would act as encounter cards, but with more controllable or situationally advantageous effects.

Very cool idea, I think locations in general would be a neat twist to have advantageous ones you want to keep in play/in the staging area like Rivendell or Helm's Deep, etc...

People have noted that we need more regular readying cards other than Unexpected Courage and Fast hitch. I suggest this one. 

Dunedain Request

Cost 0

Leadership Attachment

Signal

Attach to a hero. May be played during the Travel Phase.

Ally Éomer

Húrin the Tall

Bergil

Lobelia Sackville-Baggins

Ranged non-unique Hobbit ally (with the stat creep on Knight of Belfalas, we might see a 2 cost 1/2/0/2 ally, since so far all Hobbits have at least 1 willpower and all but the elderly Gaffer Gamgee have at least 2 hit points)

Éomer is the card I want most, so that I can Sword-Thain him to kill Uglúk when playing The Uruk-hai in my thematic campaign, while having the Three Hunters as my heroes. Since he's mentioned on Lothiriel's card, I think we have a decent chance of getting him. I would love to see ally Aragorn for A Knife in the Dark and Flight  to the Ford, though Vigilant Dúnedain does a decent job of representing him. We don't yet have any ranged hobbits, and thematically we kind of need them for a Scouring in the Shire scenario (hopefully next year's PoD, as a fitting close to this iteration of the game).

The Rohan trait could use some love. If we get another Rohan hero, I'd love for it to be Grimbold, who was known for his valour and was an important commander at the Fords of Isen and at the Pellinor Fields (and who could accompany Gandalf and Erkenbrand in a reinforcements deck for Helm's Deep). I'd also like another hero version of Sam, if it's comparable in power to Leadership Sam (the option to switch spheres without changing heroes during the campaign can be helpful). I recall seeing new art for Sam a while ago: that might be full art for this year's fellowship event (we should get details soon, right?), or a new Sam hero. Assuming Gildor shows up in this cycle, we only have three heroes unaccounted for (likely Tactics, Spirit, and Lore).

Incidentally, I really enjoyed using the Fellowship contract (as well as the new Merry and Pippin allies) for Journey in the Dark, and it definitely helped the Nine Walkers. I wonder how many contracts we'll get. The product page for Wrath and Ruin says that it contains "three copies of each new player card," while the product page for The City of Ulfast doesn't say that, and mentions that it contains a new contract. I'm excited to see what rules the new contracts bend or break.

Don't if it was mentionned, but we have a barely full set of items which grant an other sphere when they are attach to Aragorn, except in Lore sphere.

Oh you meant an attachment which naturally belongs in Lore, not one that grants the Lore icon. Sorry my bad I misunderstood. In which case we are also missing a Tactics one (and the Sword That Was Broken is not specific for Aragorn in granting the Leadership icon), we have only Leadership and Spirit ones.

Anyway it's Spirit not Willpower.

I am hoping with Spirit Aragorn is the Sceptre of Annuminas. Since he already has attachments that grant him each sphere, something is gonna overlap.

It would be good to have an attachment that grants him Leadership, outside of the Leadership sphere, so I am hoping the Sceptre does that, and of course, has an additional effect.

You're right. In tactic, I believe you have a bow with an effect for Aragorn but it doesn't give an other icon.

Yeah, the Rivendell Bow can be equipped to a Noldor/Silvan character or to Aragorn and it gives the attached character ranged (or if the character already got ranged a +1 Atk)

1. I would absolutely love to see Aragorn (and/or Strider) and Frodo Ally cards. Those two cards would make the card pool have at least one Hero and one Ally for the "The Nine Walkers". I know there is already a Strider attachment, but when Hero and Ally cards can have the same name, then I assume Ally and Attachment cards can have the same name.

2. I would absolutely love to see Thorin, Balin, Oin, Nori, and Ori Ally cards. It wouldn't give the card pool at least one Hero and one Ally for the "Unexpected Party", but it does allow all dwarves to be in the deck. A secondary request is to see Hero card versions of Fili, Kili, and Bofur.

3. With the release of the Fellowship contract, it would be nice to see (Unique) Ally card versions of a ton of Heroes. Along with the ones mentioned in #1 and #2, Bard the Bowman, Thranduil, Celeborn, Cirdan, Eomer, Eowyn, etc.

I know I went over the 5 cards. If FFG ever released a Player Card pack that just contained these Ally cards for $30-50, I would definitely purchase it.

I love my niche heroes. Dori is a clear one... he came in handy in boss battles when we were waiting to get defense boosts into play... an extra two out the gate is huge.

 

Anyway, I cant seem to figure out Fatty and Spippin. I need some event or attachment or even some hero that can make them all worth it. Spirit heroes that raise threat? Seems awfully weird.

Some things on my "top list of hopes" for the remaining cycle:


King Elessar (Title Attachment, Aragorn only): Something that rewarded Aragorn for belonging to all four spheres, sort of like how Prince of Dol Amroth rewards Imrahil for having Outlands allies from all four spheres.  Maybe something like a 3-cost neutral attachment that can only be attached to Aragorn, with some small general bonus and a big bonus if Aragorn has all four spheres: "Aragorn gains Sentinel. If Aragorn has the printed Sentinel keyword, he gains +1 [DEF] instead.  Action: If Aragorn belongs to the [Tactics], [Lore], [Spirit], and [Leadership] sphere, exhaust King Elessar to do two of the following: choose a character to remove 1 damage, choose a player to draw 1 card, choose a player to lower his Threat by 1, or deal 1 damage to an enemy engaged with you."

Gwaihir (Tactics Hero): With multiple Ent heroes in the game, I don't see a reason why the Eagles couldn't have a Hero.  So many fun and interesting abilities an Eagle hero could have to synergize well with the sub-theme, be it "sneak-attacking' eagle allies, allowing eagle allies to be played form the discard, granting a response when an eagle enters/leaves play, etc.  To that end, also having a unique attachment for the "Wind-Lord's Crown" (something akin to Khaliel's Headress or Elven-King or Hardy Leadership or Veteran Leadership or the like) to attach to a unique Eagle would be neat.  While I'm crushing on the eagle theme, I'd also love to see a Wilyador unique Eagle ally, as having just even one more quality Eagle ally available would also help round out Eagles decks, and to pay homage to Journey to Rhosgobel he could have something like "Response: After Wiylador enters or leaves play, heal 1 damage on a character (2 if that character is an Eagle)."

Grimbeorn (unique ally): another beneficiary of Beorning Skin-Changer would be nice, especially if Grimbeorn had some mechanic to return discarded Beorning characters from the discard to the hand.  Alternatively, in order for "Beorning-themed" decks to be able to run Beorn and Grimbeorn as heroes, would be even nicer if this ability was found on an FFG-created character instead.

Aiglos (unique attachment): this would be nice to round out the four spheres for a Guarded legendary weapon, and Gil-Galad's spear seems like the perfect candidate for the Spirit Sphere.  1 Cost [SPIRIT] attachment.  Guarded (Location, Enemy). Weapon. Item. Artifact. Restricted.  Attach to a Hero.  +2 Attack.  Response: After attached hero participates in an attack that destroys an enemy, lower your threat by 1.

Aiglos.jpg [https://crystal-cdn3.crystalcommerce.com/photos/878698/Aiglos.jpg]


Fram Framson: Some sort of hero/ally that had something like "While attacking or defending against a Creature, Fram Framson gains +1 [ATK] and +1 [DEF].  While attacking or defending against a Drake or Dragon, Fram Framson does not exhaust and gains +2 [ATK] and +2 [DEF].  This sort of design is problematically silver-bulleted against certain quests, but I'm sure the FFG devs could construct a much better ability that gets Fram into the game.



Wow, I suppose that's already five cards.  So many things I'd still love to see for this game!

I'd also like to see Bergil (ally), another unique Palantir or two, Anduril (some sort of attachment that has to be attached to "Sword That Was Broken") and so many other things.

Tactics Boromir would that sword Aiglos! Also great list of cards!

I would love a Gwaihir hero that you could spend a resource from his pool to put an Eagle ally into play for a phase. A crown that could go on him that says "Action exhaust to choose 1, reduce the cost of the next event card that contains the bolded text Eagle on it to 0 or return an event card from your discard pile to your hand that has the bolded text Eagle on it."

 

And then a Wilyador ally that has:

Cost 5

Willpower 3

Attack 1

Defense 2

HP 4

Response: After Wilyador enters or leaves play, heal all damage from a character or discard a condition card.

 

That would round out the Eagles for me as a playstyle. 

 

Also Huorns that go in the staging area to deal a damage/can weakly attack enemies that enter it.

This is a really neat idea, and could give Ent-themed decks access to something akin to traps.  Love it.

I also really like player cards that shuffle player encounter cards into the encounter deck (Tom Bombadillo!, Flight of the Eagles, Ranger Summons, Flight to the Sea), as they are just a lot of fun and it's always exciting when they come up in the perfect situation or totally misfire (and it's more incentive to scry/set the encounter deck with things like Scout Ahead).

At this point the character I most want in this game is Bergil. As I reflect on what the game needs most, and what makes sense with the character, this comes to mind.

0 cost Spirit

0 Willpower

0 Attack

0 Defense

1 Hit point

Gondor

While Bergil is exhausted, he gains: Response: After you quest successfully, discard Bergil to reduce your threat by 1 and draw a card.

 

He provides more size reduction to decks and pairs with Lotheriel's ability. And he can also gain the bonuses from Leadership Boromir and the attachment that gives Gondor allies +1 willpower.

I would much rather see Hurin the Tall rather than Bergil... He is just a kid and probably wouldnt even fit in the time frame of the game, since it happened before the events in lord of the rings and Bergil is just a kid then.

If Wilyador does come as an Eagle Ally/Hero I think a better callback ability would be: "If Wilyador has no damage, he does not exhaust to quest."

I REALLY need a powerful Anduril card, guarded or just expensive, that can attach to a dunedain and help that archetype.

BUT MOST OF ALL I NEED AN ATTACHMENT FOR A HERO OF ALL FOUR SPHERES.  PLEASE.  I LOVE COLLECTING SPHERES AND MINI-GAMES WITHIN THE GAME.

I wouldn't say Pillars of the Kings is a particularly Gondor-enabling card, I mean there are Gondor cards that deal with Valor but they are not the core of really any of the Gondor decks. I will try it in my monoLeadership Gondor swarm, but I'm not likely to replace Strength of Arms with Need Drives Them.

Ithil Stone I doubt, but the fact they included both the Elostirion Stone and Saruman hero this cycle pretty much guarantees we should see them. What I would love to see as well are more doomed cards that actually related with the original doomed theme, which was Isengard and the magic arts. But it seems that doomed this cycle is going to be just generic events, which sucks.

@Gizlivadi [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/185970-gizlivadi/] I saw a very noticeable jump in the power level of my mono-leadership Gondor deck after including PotKs. In addition to the extra 4 cards you get to power up Veteran of Osgilliath (& the upcoming Angbor the Fearless). While Strength of Arms is great, Need Drives Them will allow you to splash in Tactics or even Spirit in your Gondor build.

Those would be great though, especially since the guarded cards are slightly changed from their saga implementations. The cup could be a massive card draw (like choose resources or cards and gain up to 5 of either). The bow could grant the printed ranged keyword and +2 Attack which would allow for some new opportunities and design.

Yes we really need an Ally Frodo and Aragorn to round out the fellowship options. Aragorn could be a neutral ally and count as having all printed spheres. Maybe be like his iteration in the Sagas where he gains a resource every round and can spend two to ready any hero.

Frodo could be exhaust to add a resource to a hero you control.

There's a lot of guarded cards one might still expect.

A blue weapon that lowers threat to round out the spheres with Orcrist/Glamdring/Durin's Axe.

Some sort of powerful defensive guarded attachment - we've had none of those yet - like a shield that gives +3 defense or a Spear that does 2 damage when declared as a defender.

Possible Anduril.

People have noted other palantirs that may come.

I think at this point in the cycle it's pretty clear some (if not most) of these will be left out.

I hope I am wrong but I can't imagine such a weapon coming. Way too powerful, because the others have no restriction per phase, while Beregond and Fastred do. A ranged hero supporting a dunedain deck could keep the 2nd player in secrecy the entire game. As it is, there are some crazy combos you can make with those three, including the Orcrist+Elladan.

It would be pretty easy to give it a "once per phase" restriction, should the designer(s) feel it warranted, even if the other Guarded Weapons don't have such a limitation. 

Frankly, I think such a weapon would be well within the power level of the current game.  Popular Heroes like Beregond-Sp, Galdriel, and Frodo-Ld already offer means to manage threat every round (as do several less popular Heroes like Fastred and Merry), and the list of player cards to reduce threat is fairly long.   To me, at least, a guarded weapon that requires that it's bearer participates in a fatal attack in order to trigger doesn't seem unfairly good given many of the other quality threat-control options now available.

Besides, I'm sure if someone pitched a sword that let the bearer draw a card (Glamdring) or gain a resource (Orcrist), most of us would think it was too good of an ability... and yet each of those has existed for awhile now, and can even be triggered multiple times a turn if the bearer can ready (pretty trivial) and has enough squishy targets (really dependent on the quest and staging).

The designers have repeatedly said that they will never design a card that will ready attachments. There are too many ways it could create OP combos or break the game.

It would also be cool to get some mounts that aren't horses.  Like an eagle or a pony for dwarves/hobbits?

A guarded (enemy) warg mount would be cool as well.

All of those are great ideas! An Eagle mount would be boss level awesomeness

A Debate

0 cost neutral side quest

Limit one per deck.

- progress

Card art: Aragorn and Gandalf on Caradras

Forced: When you play this card pay 1 resource onto it. 

Response: after a player pays a resource onto this card, any player may do the same.

At the end of the quest phase, the player who paid the last resource onto this quest draws x + 1 cards where x is the number of resources on this card. Add this card to the victory display.

Victory 1

So in some deck building, I noticed there are two cards needed to round out some similar effects across the spheres.

1. Other than the side quest, there is no "limit 1 per deck" in lore. (To join path of need, fall of gil-galad, and black arrow/red arrow)

2. There is no revive a hero in leadership (to join Landroval, fortune or fate, and houses of healing)

I'd like to see both in the final pack.

Great ideas!

I felt like The Great Hunt was supposed to be that card just on power level, or Tom Bombadil, or any of their insane card draw. Lore really is the best sphere haha. But I think if there was to be a new one, I would say something like: 

Elven Magic: Cost 5, limit one per deck, choose an non-objective, non-unique enemy or location in play and add Elven Magic to the victory display to add that selected card to the victory display.

 

As for the hero saving, something like an attachment skill called Such a Victory. Cost 2. Attach to a Warrior Hero. When that hero has Damage tokens equal to hit points, instead of being defeated, remove one Damage token and add Such a Victory to the victory display to keep that hero in play.

"'No!' said Aragorn, taking his hand and kissing his brow. 'You have
conquered. Few have gained such a victory. Be at peace! Minas Tirith shall not fall!"

Anduril

Unique Leadership Cost 1

Guarded (Enemy)

Attach to Aragorn

+1 Attack, +1 Defense

Response: When you play this card, You may shuffle x copies of Army of the Dead into the encounter deck. X is one less than the number of resource icons Aragorn possesses (limit once per game).

*Stone of Amon Sul

Artifact. Item.

Cost 1

Guarded (Enemy)

Restricted

Attach to a hero. Attached hero gains +2 defense.

Response: After attached hero exhausts to defend, exhaust Stone of Amon Sul to reveal an attacking enemy's shadow card. If that card has no shadow effect, ready the defending hero and add one resource to its resource pool, then deal that enemy a new shadow card.

 

I really like Stone of Elostirion, but thought it sadly lacked the risk factor that the Palantiri should have in the time period of this game. We could very easily be getting a guarded Leadership attachment in Land of Sorrow, so this is a possibility. I wanted a guarded card that seems right at home in a Dunedain deck. Drawing the enemy can be a big help, and defense in that deck archetype is never a bad thing. The response seems right in line with a palantir. Look in to prepare for battle, but perhaps in so doing you will make matters worse for yourself.

New palantiri are ALWAYS welcome. Wish we could break the timeframe a little bit so we could have all 7 of them, but oh well. No encounter Ithil Stone sucks too. As for the stone of Elostirion, thematically it shouldn't be too risky, as this one was disconnected from the others and could only look West into Aman, so no risk of Sauron's influence at all.

I recently picked up Sands of Harad, and while I love the Legolas Gimli shenanigans, I'm not a huge fan of LeGimli. So... I want to see this in the last pack:

*Gimlified

Title

Cost 1 - Neutral

Attach to a hero. Attached hero loses its current name and gains "Gimli" as its new name.

Leadership gimli is pretty good actually. His stats are designed for defending and yes, he needs a boost but there are tonnes of ways to do that. Warnings, dwarf shields, ring mail are but a few options. And being able to ready a hero is great too! I would think hes better than Sp legolas, who is designed for attacking but triggers off of questing. Legolas also has fewer targets to ready than Gimli because its in the quest phase.

Leadership Gimli is good, and the readying is great. My sister and I are doing a four player campaign running both Legolas and Gimli. We often find that there is a hero we would rather have ready than Gimli, but that hero doesn't get a boost. Which is why every hero of Middle-Earth ought to be named Gimli!!😏

It still bugs me that we never got the last Hero from Middle Earth Quest, we have Eleanor, Beravor, Argalad, and Thalin; with most releasing in the core set, but we never got our token Rohan hero. So with that being said here is my hope for an after the break Rohan addition:

 

Eometh

10 Threat

Spirit

Willpower 2

Defense 2

Attack 2

Hitpoints 4

Rohan, Warrior

Sentinel

Setup: Search your deck for a Mount Attachment and add it to your hand.

When playing a mount Attachment, Eometh is considered to have the printed tactics, leadership and Lore icons.

Response; after you play a Mount Attachment on a character you control, draw a card, limit once per round.

I love the look of this guy! I always include Leadership Elfhelm in my Rohan Fellowships, and this guy fits right in the build! Only thing that I would note is that his second ability (with the current card pool) has no effect. All mounts can attach to either Rohan, Spirit, or Sentinel heroes with the exception of Trait specific Mounts like Asfolath or Hobbit Pony.

Actually no, since it's not "when playing a mount attachment on itself", it's more about being able to play mounts off any sphere (like an armored destrier in a mono spirit deck) than about Eomeht being able to be the recipient of any mount. It's the Mount counterpart of Bard Son of Brand

That's exactly right and what I was going for, to be able to bring all of the mounts and pay for them with this hero despite different spheres.

In his last appearance on Cardtalk, Caleb said that there would be more in this cycle to help make Rohan a top tear archetype. Their main problems have been lack of card draw and healing resulting from the fact that they have virtually no Lore cards. Here's my guess at an ally who would help with card draw, and resulting from lack of healing.

Veteran of the Fords

Cost 3 Leadership

0 willpower

2 attack

2 defense

2-3 hitpoints

Response: When Veteran of the Fords enters play, choose a player. That player may draw 1 card for each damaged Rohan character.

Thematically, this would represent Grimbold's forces who stalled Isengard while the rest of the Rohirrim traveled to Helm's Deep.

Great idea, I don’t even think you would need to have the part about them being damaged though, it’s tricky enough to build up a board state with those guys to begin with

That could become a little too overpowered I feel. I intentionally designed the card to get better with multiple players using Rohan. Rohan can be very powerful by virtue of having lots of effects that spill over to other Rohan players like Hero Elfhelm, Astonishing Speed, Eomund, and Spirit Eowyn. Astonishing Speed paired with Eomund can result in insane amounts of willpower because all Rohan characters in play get +2 willpower and are then ready for the combat phase. If Veteran of the Fords drew one card for each Rohan character, one layer could easily draw a tremendous portion of their deck very quickly.

Or "for each Rohan character he discarded last turn" though it might be a little too convoluted for the usual approach to the game.

Ah I missed that it was just character and not character you control. That’s fair then, though it makes the card much weaker for solo play, trying to get fragile characters damaged is tricky outside of Erkenbrand.

Though I would still use "discarded" since it's more thematic with the whole Rohan mechanic (and to avoid combo with Sneak Attack, Lothiriel and so forth)

## 106 [Fantasty on May 3, 2020](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/300107-top-5-player-cards-you-still-want/?do=findComment&comment=3933913)

I'm incredibly happy with the card pool we have at the moment and there aren't a whole lot of deck types I think are still severely under supported. That being said, there are two themes I think could still use some love: Rohan and Dunedain.

For Rohan, while The Muster of Rohan is already a step in the right direction, I think the Mount theme within Rohan is still not visibie enough. It would be really cool to have a Mount attachment that could go on allies, so you could run more Mount cards in a Rohan deck and get more value out of flavourful cards like Charge of the Rohirrim. I would therefore love to see the following cards:

> Quote
> 
> Gárulf (Unique)
> Tactics Ally (3 Cost)
> 
> 1 Willpower / 3 Attack / 1 Defense / 2 HP
> 
> Rohan. Warrior.
> 
> At the end of the round, discard Gárulf from play.
> 
> Response: After Gárulf enters play, search the top 10 cards of your deck for a Mount attachment and put it into play.

> Quote
> 
> Hasufel (Unique)
> Spirit Attachment (2 Cost)
> 
> Mount.
> 
> Attach to a Rohan character or Aragorn. Restricted.
> 
> Response: When attached character leaves play, attach Hasufel to another eligible target instead of discarding it. Then, exhaust Hasufel.
> 
> Action: Exhaust Hasufel and deal 1 damage to attached character to ready attached character and give it +1 Willpower, +1 Attack and +1 Defense until the end of the phase.

Since it's highly likely that the hero in the last pack will be Spirit Aragorn, I think the above cards would fit in nicely in terms of lore and mechanics. Speaking of Spirit Aragon, I would love for him to be as follows:

> Quote
> 
> Aragorn (Unique)
> Spirit Hero (12 Threat)
> 
> 2 Willpower / 3 Attack / 2 Defense / 5 HP
> 
> Dunedain. Gondor. Noble.
> 
> Sentinel.
> 
> Reduce the cost of the first ally you play each round by 1 for each Trait that ally shares with Aragorn (to a minimum of 1).

This is supposed to represent Aragorn after the events of the Return of the King when he is crowned King of Gondor. I think his change in traits reflects that, and his ability also signifies how he is able to potentially bring all races and factions together. It's also nice support for Dunedain decks, whose allies are notoriously overpriced.

To play into the high cost of Dunedain allies, and to represent their elite status and versatility on and off the battlefield, I would also love to see the following card:

> Quote
> 
> Northern Veteran
> Leadership Attachment (2 Cost)
> 
> Skill.
> 
> Attach to a Dunedain ally. Limit 1 per character.
> 
> Action: Exhaust Northern Veteran to choose an attribute (Willpower, Attack, Defense). Add attached ally's printed cost to its chosen attribute until the end of the phase.

I think this helps make some of the Dunedain allies feel as powerful as they are meant to be, plus it rewards you for playing those high cost allies in the first place. Additionally, it makes Dunedain decks worth playing without having to fit in 10+ cards just to keep enemies engaged to trigger all their abilities, as this card is reward enough on its own.

I think a lot of these cards would thematically fit the last pack of this cycle so I actually have good hope that some of them are printed in some form or another. At the very least it would make sense that we would get some final Dunedain support if Aragorn is indeed the last hero.

Curious to hear your thoughts!

Love them. At first I was skeptical about a 4 cost tactics ally that leaves play, but to not have to sphere match allows you to run a red theoden hero lineup and still get snowmane in.

Would Hasufel work? It's kind of like Treebeard hero getting song of mocked. The trigger doesn't work if something else pays the cost.

You're right about Hasufel. I just updated those two cards slightly to be a bit more streamlined :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Some other wishes for the last pack since I'm feeling inspired atm. I truly believe one pack is enough to give us all the cards I'd still like to see; like I said, I'm already really happy with the card pool so far :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Additional support for Aragorn and it would be cool to get a non-Fellowship version of this card:

> Quote
> 
> Banner of Elendil (Unique)
> Neutral Attachment (3 Cost)
> 
> Artifact. Item.
> 
> Attach to Aragorn. Restricted.
> 
> If Aragorn belongs to the Spirit sphere, each other character you control gets +1 Willpower.
> 
> If Aragorn belongs to the Tactics sphere, each other character you control gets +1 Attack.
> 
> If Aragorn belongs to the Leadership sphere, each other character you control gets +1 Defense.
> 
> If Aragorn belongs to the Lore sphere, each other character you control gets +1 HP.

Additional Valour support, because while the support of late has been good, I think we need a way to pay for those overpriced existing Valour events more easily:

> Quote
> 
> The Cost of War
> Leadership Event (2 Cost)
> 
> Action: Add X resources to a Noble hero's resource pool, where X is the tens digit of your threat. (Limit 4 resources.)
> 
> Valour Action: Exhaust a Noble hero to play or put into play one card from your hand for no cost.
>  

A Frodo ally, which we desperately need. I tried to let this one synergize with the Sam ally while still being useful on his own:

> Quote
> 
> Frodo Baggins (Unique)
> Spirit Ally (2 Cost)
> 
> 2 Willpower / 0 Attack / 1 Defense / 2 HP
> 
> Hobbit.
> 
> Response: After you raise your threat, exhaust Frodo Baggins to add 1 resource to a Hobbit hero's resource pool. (Limit once per round.)

A final Dunedain ally for more flexible engagement tricks:

> Quote
> 
> Rhudaur Wanderer
> Lore Ally (3 Cost)
> 
> 2 Willpower / 1 Attack / 1 Defense / 2 HP
> 
> Dunedain. Ranger.
> 
> Action: Exhaust Rhudaur Wanderer to choose an enemy not engaged with you. Engage the chosen enemy.

And this last one is probably not gonna happen, but just for fun:

> Quote
> 
> The White Wizard (Unique)
> Neutral Attachment (3 Cost)
> 
> Title.
> 
> Attach to Gandalf or Saruman.
> 
> While The White Wizard is ready, play with the top card of the encounter deck face-up. 
> 
> Action: Exhaust The White Wizard and raise your threat by 1 to discard the top card of the encounter deck.

I'd like to see a card are two thrown at the Woodmen and the Beornings, the two archtypes who are thinnest on the ground.  Of the "major" tribes, I agree Dunedain would benefit the most from help.

Elfhelm could use more mounts.

Hama could use a different errata.

Hobbits need a Lobelia Sackville-Baggins ally

🤣

There's no way that flies. Shadow cards come in known to all.

I thought of one similar, though. I had a non-exhausting attachment for saruman that said "look at the top card of the encounter deck. Then raise your threat by the threat of the card"

All great options, and more mounts could combine with other mount ideas: Eagle mount (for hobbits/dwarves/wizards in times of Need haha), Treebeard Ent Mount for Hobbits, Mumakil mount for the Harad characters. And honestly another non-unique mount specific for Rohan characters, maybe when the attached Rohan ally would be discarded you may exhaust this horse too keep that character in play but put a damage on it.

Woodmen would be great to have something like Woodsmen’s Camp attachment which could be a 0 cost attachment that says “attach to a location in play, limit 1 per location. While the attached location is the active location, reduce the cost to play Woodsmen allies by 1. 
 

And

Woodworking Camp, 0 cost attachment, attach to the active location, after the active location leaves play as an explores location, add 2 resources to the resource pool of a hero you control and draw 2 cards. 
 

or just a straight up woodsmen axe that can go on any woodsmen and you can exhaust that character + axe to put a progress on a location or the active location if you wanted to get specific.

 

For Beornings something fun could be:

Beorning Honey-Cake cost 1 tactics attachment: Discard to ready attached character and then search your deck for a non-creature Beorning ally and put it into play. 
 

Dunedain needs someway to just straight to reduce enemies attack strength and/or have a multi-readying defender for them.

 

Hama has no errata for me but if people want A different one, maybe just specifying response cards only or 0 cost cards only.

 

Also yes to your hobbit ally choice!

Lobelia Sackville-Baggins 2 cost, neutral (that's right, first neutral hobbit) 1, 1, 2, 2

Deal one damage to a hobbit you control to add one resource to a hero's resource pool (limit once per round)

After much thought, I've come up with my own preferred Hama errata that prevents indefinite Thicketing (or for that matter, 4 consecutive thickets with one card), but doesn't make Hama a three-time-only recurrer.

Passive ability: You may play an event from the victory display as if it were in your hand, then remove the event from the game.

Response: when Hama attacks, you may discard a card from your hand to place a tactics event in the victory display.

The modified Hama ability prevents him from recurring any individual event more than once, but puts no limit on the number of events that he can recur once.  It also gives him some possible interactions with a Victory Display deck that I think would be interesting and mostly helpful.

That's brilliant! Do you mind if we use it in the Ancient Mathoms?

I don't mind at all.  But rereading I see that I omitted "from the discard pile" from his response -- the tactics event needs to be in the discard, though he technically could toss an event from his hand and then put that event in the victory display -- aside from Ringmaker card-hate or powering up Keen as Lances I'm not sure why he would want to do that, though.

I was thinking of a tactics ally, with the art showing her whacking a ruffian with her umbrella.

Of course, what I *really* want is a Lobelia hero with Umberella and Silver Spoons attachments designed for her.

Going back to my old post about rounding out spheres with common abilities, it's interesting that the four unique "leaves play at the end of the round" allies belong to the white council. Thus far we have two neutrals (gandalf and saruman), a leadership (galadriel) and a lore (elrond). This leaves spirit and tactics to split up amongst the other members of the council. Now there seems to be a bit of a discrepancy on who is technically a member of the council. I will assume we get Cirdan and Radagast, though there's mention that maybe Celeborn was part of it too (also works with the council of the wise contract art).

Regardless, that would be pretty cool to get some more high-cost, high-ability leave play allies. Not sure what they would say or do.

I think in the Council contract art besided Galadriel and Gandalf we are looking at Elrond (brown instead of dark hair is more plausible as discrepancy than the silver of Celeborn hair). Fitting since they are the keepers of the Three Rings.

I think it's quite clearly a theme, but we won't see anymore allies like that cause we already have all the officially known members of the Council (since as you say it was kinda unclear who was a member besides those above)

A few posts ago people were considering ways to help Dunedain, in particular paying for the expensive allies. How about another Signal?

___

Dunedain Relic [2, Leadership]

Signal. Artefact. Item

Attach to a Dunedain hero.

Action: Add one resource to attached hero's resource pool to attach Dunedain Relic to another eligible hero (limit once per round for the group).

____

Aside from being a clever reverse of how the Signals operate, it helps Dunedain raise resources for the allies, whilst also possibly helping some of the other Signal attachments - you could generate a resource with this, then spend it to transfer a Mark/Warning to someone else (though perhaps that's a bit jank).

I considered removing/altering the Dunedain restriction, but it felt that might be overpowered (though no more so than Steward of Gondor I suppose). Maybe this should also be a unique?

Or a Tactics Thranduil/Celeborn and a Spirit Cirdan.  While they weren't explicitly on the Council, it's pretty reasonable to assume Elven Royalty would be members, if anyone else was a member.  They are also big characters without existing ally versions.  Even if they aren't Council Members, they'd make strong contenders as allies that send distant aide from their haven, which is sort of what I take Elrond and Galadriel to represent.

I'll try:

Cirdan -- Spirit, 4 cost, 3, 1, 2, 4Hp

At the end of the round, discard Cirdan. 

While Cirdan is in play, each unique character gets (choose 1): +2 willpower, +2 attack, or +2 defense.

 

Thranduil -- Tactics, 5 cost, 2, 3, 2, 3Hp

At the end of the round, discard Thranduil.

When Thranduil enters play, (choose 1): discard a non-unique location or each player may search their deck for a silvan ally and play it as if from the hand for no cost.

One small, wording-Nazi note: the Cirdan ally should have the name "Cirdan the Shipwright" to ensure that you cannot play both hero and ally. 😉

My friends,

Call it a labor of love,

call it boredom from quarantine,

call it inspiration born of disappointment of leaks to the last pack....

 

But I started on my quest to make my own custom cycle. I have in my mind a little bit of the story for the cycle, a few of the dynamics (we are revisiting some places so I could combine from other quest sets). As for the player cards, I have compiled a combination of cards suggested here, maybe with a few tweaks, with some other ideas I've seen around the web.

I've completed the "Deluxe Expansion" player card text and the first pack. Let me know what you think. They feature a different dynamic by including NO HEROES, but two allies that can be chosen as heroes with interesting synergies. 

The cycle revolves around a task sent from Dain Ironfoot II after Sauron tempted an alliance with him, offering the three remaining rings of power. Dain sends the heroes on a quest to steal the remaining three rings from Dol Guldor and to take them to a dragon's lair to have them destroyed by dragon fire. I hope to have some fun twists and turns in the story telling.

Here is a link to the Google Doc:

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DV7tyEUJKuu4B7hibFlSARVtvo6AwrdeUjHl6iMtuh8/edit?usp=sharing [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DV7tyEUJKuu4B7hibFlSARVtvo6AwrdeUjHl6iMtuh8/edit?usp=sharing]

 

Hopefully you feel like your ideas were honored here, and if I haven't gotten to them yet, trust that I will probably get around to it. 

 

Also, if you are keen to create some artwork and really bring these cards to life, that would be amazing!

I'll take a stab at it. I would like to get a deluxe deluxe extension featuring The Battle Under the Trees, The Siege of Dale and the Scourging of the Shire. It would be nice if it had the same amount of player cards as the core set and included the things and people that are still missing from the book  like: Hurin the Tall, Goldberry, Lobelia Baggins, Horn, Bergil, Dervorin, Star of Elendil, guarded Anduril, ect.  Also, I would like the Blue Wizards.

What traits still need to be fleshed out a little bit? I feel like Beorning still needs a little work, but the Skin-changer helped a bit. I wouldn't mind a couple more additions to that pool.

Bree.

Cost 0 

0 Willpower

Encounter Action: Put Drunken Prancing Pony Patron into play from your hand, then engage the lowest engagement cost non-unique enemy in play.

I have stumbled upon the name Whil Whitfoot, the mayor of the shire at the time of the scouring. Im thinking that will be a great 4th hero of the cycle above.

Whil Whitfoot

Leadership, 6 threat, 2, 1, 2, 2

Each Hobbit character you control gets +1 Defense.

If every Hero you control has the Hobbit trait, Whil Whitfoot gains: "Response: after you raise your threat from a player card effect, lower your threat by one and draw one card. Limit once per phase."

 

 

I think he will get a leadership attachment as well that will be the mayor title. Id like it also to synergize with Sam, so maybe on the same trigger give an additional stat boost to a choice of willpower, attack or defense?

Thoughts on that?

I would settle for either the first or the second ability. They don't have a lot to do with each other and each of them is absolutely insane by themselves. (The second ability is almost better Galadriel with the right deck)

If you go for the first one, maybe make the major title about hobbit cost reduction. It's a minor synergy but i wouldn't go to crazy with swarm buffs and could help you bring the defense swarm together. 
If you go for the second one, i would do a major title like this: Action: Increase your threat by one. Ready a hobbit character. Imo fits into leadership and the flavor.

I didn't even think of that. Perhaps it makes it less breakable to have it say "hero card effect" which limits it to Fatty, Frodo, and Pippin for the current pool.

And a "once per round" limit.

Well if I limit it to once per phase then perhaps there are some crazies who would run fatty and spippin/frodo together. 

Should I have it cost 1 resource to trigger? Or is the limit of only hobbit heroes cost enough?

Neutral. It would be a good splash card then. It should also have the text: "He says your beer is always good"-The Return of the King

I have in my mind a little bit of the story for the cycle, a few of the dynamics (we are revisiting some places so I could combine from other quest sets). As for the player cards, I have compiled a combination of cards suggested here, maybe with a few tweaks, with some other ideas I've seen around the web.

Dain sends the heroes on a quest to steal the remaining three rings from Dol Guldor and to take them to a dragon's lair to have them destroyed by dragon fire. I hope to have some fun twists and turns in the story telling.

I applaude your creativity and willingness.

But.

This is something I already was militant with A-Long Extended Party (which I'm an active part of): I think this point of the game, it's not so much about creating new player cards.

Fan-made player cards are REALLY controversial, everyone will think they have a better design for two blue Wizards or whatever. I made my own custom "Deluxe" expansion (with 4 quests). It took me YEARS (and I was motivated). It does include player cards, but I don't showcase them a lot, because I prefer people to be playing the quests I've designed.

Designing a quest for LOTR is actually harder than throwing in a bunch of player cards idea (and again, do not misread me: I've read your Google Docs, you have a lot of good ideas, no doubt about that).

But if I were you (and I'm not so in the end, you do whatever you want :)) I would develop first the quests. The narrative, the quest mechanics you want to explore, etc. That is the most important. Quests add a lot of replaybility with the current player card pool.

EDIT: as a side note, it's even better if those quests can be played with just a Core Set (a design mistake I've made, clearly).

Thank you for the advice. I think I will follow your advice and design the quests first and maybe develop the story a little bit. I'm worried because my story telling pales in comparison to Tolkien and the creators of this game. It's certainly much easier to immerse oneself in deck building and see what it missing and just fill in the gaps.

However, in messing with the woodland realm/wizard quests this week, I am a bit motivated to try and build synergizing encounter decks. So it might be worth starting with that and building the story around it or in conjunction with it. 

I figured there might be some individuals here that would love to jump in with this too, if they are interested. 

Of course as I see more ideas here and come up with my own, I think I will continue adding to the Google Sheet 🙂

 

By the way, I really enjoyed play testing your Light in the East quests. I still need to play #3 and #4, the quarantine has prevented my friend and I meeting to play (and I havent figured out why the OCTGN files don't work), but it will be a blast to finish it up.

I think you can find storytellers on those forums quite easily, just create your own thread! 🙂

I would love some Tactics cards that offer reliable readying outside of the combat phase. At the moment, the only non-hero Tactics card that does that is Hold Your Ground, which is an event that only targets sentinel characters. 

Unexpected Courage, Snowmane, Wingfoot, Leather Boots, Steed of the North, Heir of Mardil, etc. provide readying for heroes that were committed to the quest. How am I supposed to ready my heroes in Mono-Tactics decks? Magic Ring? 

An attachment like Leather Boots that triggers when an enemy is revealed would be a great addition to the card pool.

I guess you are referring to playing mono-Tactics solo right?

Anyway I do not find so strange that Tactics readying options are mainly restricted to combat (in general, even outside the combat phase), it's kinda fitting. If you really have need to ready some characters and cannot rely on other decks keep in mind for general decks The White Council and possibly The Free People, for certain decks Boomed and Trumpeted and Ring of Thror can be good too.

A card like Steed of the North could just as easily have been a Tactics cards. I don't see why Tactics shouldn't offer at least 1 in-sphere repeatable ready that doesn't relate to attack and defense. At this point in the game's lifespan I actually find it stranger that this hasn't happened yet. I'm not asking for a universal ready like Unexpected Courage, but some way to consistently ready a hero would be great. It could be limited to warriors only and I'd still be happy to have it. 

I understand that there are some neutral readying options, but I was specifically talking about the lack of tactics readying.
