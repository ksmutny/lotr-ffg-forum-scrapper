Hi All, I'm playing The Lonely Mountain (from On the Doorstep) and have a question about Smaug the Golden.  He has an X threat level.  X = the number of non-burglar characters commited to the question.  So what's a burglar character?  I haven't seen any burglar key words anywhere.

The Bilbo hero that comes with On the Doorstep has the "Burglar" trait.  He's the only one who's got it.
