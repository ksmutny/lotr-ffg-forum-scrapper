His ability reads "After he enters or leaves play deal 2 damage to any enemy" 

 

I have always played as if you can only pick 1; enter or leave.  But does he deal damage both times?  Both when he enters and leaves play?

 

Thanks

Yes, he deals damage whenever he enters or leaves play

Yup both!  It's a Response, so it can be triggered anytime and as many times as its condition is satisfied.
