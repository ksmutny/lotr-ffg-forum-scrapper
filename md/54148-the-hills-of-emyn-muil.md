So, I got my Emyn Muil AP in the mail today and just finished up my first attempt, how are you guys liking it?  I think it's a lot different than the scenarios we've seen in the past.  It was a little easier than Carrock and Rhosgobel, but still presented some difficult challenges.  I only had to fight 1 Dol Guldor Orcs the entire quest, so it was definitely quite a change from Carrock and even Rhosgobel for that matter.

I posted my thoughts here (http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=557299 [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=557299]).

The short answer is that I think it is the least interesting and dynamic of the four quests released in APs thus far.

Yeah, just replied over there.  It's definitely the most boring of the four AP scenarios to date.

Turn 1: Quest all characters

Turn 2: Quest all characters

Turn 3: Quest all characters

Turn 4: Quest all ...  you get the point...
