If you don't have progress tokens on a quest but you do on an active location, shoes Despair remove tokens from the active location?

I checked FAQ but I couldn't find anything. (Unless I overlooked it....)

I've always played it that you remove tokens from the quest card only (and if you have less than 4, then you remove as many tokens as you can).  While it is true the you place progress on active locations first and they "overflow" to the quest card, I've never seen anything in the rules that suggest things go the other way (drain tokens from quest card and if not enough, then take from active location).

Overlooked…  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

(1.05) Removing Progress Tokens from Quests
When a card effect removes progress tokens from a
quest or quest card, the effect applies specifically to the
quest card, and never to the active location.
