Hello

Iâ€™ve bought this gamemat but how can you play with four players on this mat? Attached is a picture while playing solo with two decks.

Thanks

you can't lol

same as their "4-player" mat for Marvel Champions recently released, there is no way you can fit 4 players on it. But, i still consider them great mats for solo players, because I love the spaces for encounter deck, etc.

Yes thatâ€™s correct, perfect for solo and I think also for two players

Wow, I assumed this was much larger, and even then I figured it was useless for 4-Player since one whole edge is dedicated to the Encounter Deck (rather than the center).


The best mat for multiplayer is the 3'x3' mat made by FFGÂ for Journeys in Middle-Earth (below, $40 usd).Â  Though I think the LotR LCG is best at 3-Player, since you can stage the encounter deck at the "top" of the mat/table and the players can then each sit at one of theÂ three open edges.Â  Once you get to 4 Player, you pretty much need a wargame-sized table so that you can stage the encounter deck in the middle, between all the players's play space.

Maybe the idea is that this is the central encounter deck mat, and then each player brings their own individual player deckÂ mat?

That's the only way it makes sense to me

We use it as the staging area and one player on an edge uses it for their mat. Then have the smaller mats for each other player. Even in 2 player we have two smaller mats off to each side to make room for spread onto this mat and heavy staging areas. I find the 1-4 player perfectÂ for solo, ok for 2 and otherwise a staging area. The JIME mat is the one to get if you just want one mat but I think FFG intentionally released this smaller so that you want to pick up more of their mats haha.Â

I play with the mat plus the 2 player starter one and that's usually barely enough room for 3 people.

I always just use that as the staging area and everything related to the quest itself. You would need an absolutelyÂ huge mat to accommodate a quest and four players play areas
