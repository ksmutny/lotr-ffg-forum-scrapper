# [FEEDBACK FOR FFG- 2 cycles in](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/68889-feedback-for-ffg-2-cycles-in/)

## 1 [richsabre on August 10, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/68889-feedback-for-ffg-2-cycles-in/?do=findComment&comment=671608)

Hello- given that we are now two complete cycles into this game, I’d like to give my feedback on how its grown, what I like and don’t like, and where I hope it to go in the future.

I remain convinced that FFG do indeed read these boards, but I guess ill mail it anyways, but if you also want to leave your feedback, feel free to do so, as the more the better.

While this is my first (and only) lcg game, I think this may have its benefits in giving feedback, as I can give an insight on what the game can offer new people to the game- obviously an important part of ffg’s company goals.

So here it is.

DESIGN – 8/10

I spent a lot of time looking for a colletable card game that offered solo play before this game came out. And while there were a few that could be modified, I guess none took my eye enough to buy them. Then I saw this game- LOTR LCG….it was perfect. So knowing absolutely nothing about the lcg format I dived in regardless. Now over a year later I have to say I love the concept. The monthly packs are just about right for me, it keeps the game fresh without being too much to keep up with.

I also like the idea of having a large pack to kick off the cycle, though I wasn’t quite so sure about the actual quests of khazad. Myself along with others found going into the mines, fleeing the balrog and so on, quite strange given we go straight back in, and for me it was a little of a premature climax (cough…no pun…honest).

As for the actual game, I really like its design. 4 spheres are about right, offering plenty of combos without being baffling for anyone new, whilst still giving endless space to grow and learn new, more experienced ways of play.

The core set, as many people will say, was a little too hard for most solo play, especially Dol Guldur, though with hindsight I see that this was probably to keep more experienced players trying the quests in the time between core release and HFG, making sure they didnt get bored and wander away.

I would have liked to have had 3 copies of all cards in the core set, but im not sure if that’s FFG policy to do so or not. I like that 3 copies max per deck and am pleased to see that that is what we now get.

THEME/ART/LORE – 10/10

This is the main reason I play the game. I wouldn’t consider myself a gamer per-se, just a Tolkien fanatic. I base a games ‘lore’ success on how much I can immerse myself within it.

Here this game scores top points. The art, as im sure you don’t need me to tell you (congrats on the award) is top notch, and I like the class of the artwork- not too ‘cartoon/manga’ style, but not too digital either. If I had 1 niggle it would be that at core release we had a good mixture of artists, now there seems to be less of a diversity, however the artists being used, such as Magali, are doing an amazing job, so its no big deal for me.

The lore correctness is also spot on, I was pleased to see lesser known characters making their way in so early on (I was particularly impressed to see the Nameless things- not many companies would have tackled that so well) and i hope you contiue to shine the spot light on tolkien's lesser known creations.

I like the little quotes on the bottom of the cards and they really help with setting the scene.

If I had one suggestion it would be to add a little bit of text at the end of the quest cards, just to round the quest off nicely…they seem to end a bit abruptly for me.

QUEST CONTENT 7/10

On the most part, the quests are great fun to play. As said previously the scaling was off on Dol Guldur, however its nice to see the scaling is getting better with each pack. The only exception to this is Return To Mirkwood, where there seems to be nothing that targets a solo player (good or negative) and the threat gain makes this one very difficult solo, and perhaps more important, less fun as its just a ‘luck rush’.

Again in general I am very impressed with the actual mechanics of the quest. The encounter sets offer a nice mixture of questing and fighting, however if I have again 1 problem it is that some quests that balance is a little off. Emyn Muil for instance is far too location heavy, and it gets a little old very quickly- thankfully the amazing art bring it back into play for me, though its just a shame as a few more enemies would have made this one of my favourites.

The difficulty level given on quests is also off for me…perhaps its because im a solo player, though they are rarely correct. The ones that are correct is probably HFG and journey down the Anduin. Though quests such as The Long Dark is much easier than the level given, and quests such as Rhosgobel I find harder than the given level. This isn’t a major thing really, just nit picking I guess.

PLAYER CARD DEVELOPMENT 8/10

Another really positive aspect of the game here. I was slightly worried at the start of the dwarrowdelf cycle with the amount of solo-useless cards, however true to your word, you gave us a lot of great solo cards in the more recent packs.

I am impressed, given all the great cards, that the core set cards are still some of the best. There doesn’t seem to be a huge amount of power creep (though im not really experienced enough to gauge this) and I can still enjoy easier quests, though admittedly ones such as HFG are getting a little of the easy side.

I would love to see something that remedies this. A fellow gamer suggested ‘weather’ effects that could be added into the encounter set to make old quests harder, and I like the idea.


I was particularly impressed recently with the addition of Hands Upon the Bow- a great card finally making RANGED useful to solo play. Id love to see something that does the same for SENTINAL.

FUTURE PROSPECTS

There has been some talk about changing the way that packs are released, and while I obviously cant comment either way before more info is given (and perhaps the rumours are wildly off anyways) id like to just point out that I (along with many others) like the way that packs are being released.

I like the addition of the SAGA packs, offering us some nice ‘side content’ whilst not (hopefully) sidetracking us too much from the game itself.

I like the idea of treasure cards and would like to see them in the game itself somehow.

Overall this game remains as much fun, probably more, than it was when it was released, and Id like to thank you all for doing such a great job

Similar sentiments here.

-Keep with the monthly Adventure Packs.

-Add Treasure cards to the normal game, not just for 3 specific quests.

-The game remains as awesome as it was when it released last year. Thanks FFG!

 The only thing I would add is PLEASE try to balance the spheres better.  Spirit and Lore are way too far ahead of Leadership and Tactics.

Well covered, Rich!   Although to not just be a mimic, I will add a few thoughts of my own to hopefully compliment your well thought-out review:

I haven't played them all, of course, but having played a wide range of TCG/CCG's, THIS was the second biggest reason I picked up this game (the fact that it was Tolkien was first, coop was third). 

I really feel that the Sphere/Race synergies are very well set-up, and once there is more support for the wide range of groups in the game, these synergies will become even better.

 I really appreciated the range of art-work in the core set.  It would be nice to see that again, although there have been some questionable choices on how a few of the cards look lately.  I know, I know… something about having cake and eating it….

Which made Brand (and even Legolas, to a lesser extent) actually PLAYABLE in a solo game…  Since he was one of my favorite characters, it's been sad that I have no use for him. Until now. 

Also, I appreciate the themes of each Sphere, but let's face it.  Your focused themes have really left the Tactics sphere to be used primarily in multiplayer games.  There has been some recent cards that definitely look decent in solo decks, but for the most part there is no way folks are going to build a primarily Tactics deck for solo play until there is at least SOME ability to quest…  I'm not asking for it to challange Spirit for questing, but at least something…  It's effectively locked out 1/4 of the player cards from serious solo deck consideration.

Can't agree more with this!  I enjoy the cycles.  They are theme-oriented, at a reasonable pace, and means that we don't have to spend hundreds of dollars to get every card in a random  pack system (ask me how familiar I am with that!).

didn't FFG say KD was like 10-15 years before the Dwarrodelf cycle? I could be totally making up the years, but it was like a prequel or prologue to what we got in the APs. Not that it matters much, and I totally get your point, but they did address this (even if they made it up post hoc!)

i'm torn on this -- the sphere's need to remain distinct. one thing i think M:tG does well (certainly in the modern era, not so much in the past) is the 5 colors are distinct and stand for something. to be sure, there is some bleeding, but by and large, you would know what you are getting if you simply knew the color of a card.

for this game, i feel they are letting the colors bleed too much, so to speak. perhaps it's a balance issue (trying to make the spheres have a little of each other sphere, for example). Mirkwood Runner definitely comes to mind when thinking of "color bleed."

so, in some ways, i don't want tactics to get better at questing…that's not it's role. just as i don't want lore to be better at attacking and spirit better at card draw, that's not their role. it starts to make the sphere's pointless (and with songs, they are in many ways; there's no "drawback," or at least it's less than in other games, to mixing the colors).

at the same time, i'm okay with a few cards in each sphere having characteristics of another sphere …. as long as the spheres, overall, retain a distinct flavor/feel.

yes, i have to say i agree with this- the spheres need to remain distinct……though leadership has seemed to me to be a mix of all spheres from the start (or was that the intention)

The spheres are fine; some are better for solo play, but Leadership and Tactics (generally weaker with one player) really rock in larger games. I would also like the spheres to remain distinct, but I think there are flavorful ways to shore up some of the weaknesses in each color (e.g., a Tactics character who gets +1 willpower each time he destroys an enemy).

My only real complaint concerns the inconsistent/ambiguous terminology we continue to see on cards. If FFG could clean that up, the game would be darn near perfect in my book. Just don't ever--EVER--change the artwork. Every new AP is a visual feast, and that's a large part of what keeps me coming back.

All in all, I love this game more than I have ever loved any other card game. I'd like to see a few simple fixes implemented, but I'll still play even if card templates continue to vary wildly. For me, the game is that enjoyable.

Well it might be some time for some constructive criticism

[ADMIN: Edited for content.]


Let me start with saying FFG is doing a great job with this game, it is easily one of the best card games I have played, and I have been playing card games for over 20 years now and have entire shelves of cards form various titles. The co-op angle is just fantastic, and while gives this game life where many of the other games are simply nvr played any more. Still I think this is a good time to offer form thoughts on what is weak in this game.

 

Boooring Monsters

One of my main problems with the LoTRlcg is that there is so little variety.. Would be nice to see some new monsters now and then instead of orc version 40 and troll version 20 … The packs are just so similar.. Some of the real stand out packs for me is like the watcher for example were we had some small respite form the constant encounter cards that are exactly the same as all the other encounter cards we have already seen.

Now I understand there is some need to stay inside the Lore of LOTR but you need to find a balance between the LORE and fun gameplay. Tolkin's work is pretty 2 dimensional so we understand that you haven't got a lot to work with. Still if you look at say the LoTR Game from GamesWorkshop you can see many interesting and fun monsters that fit nicely into the Lore that only the most pathetic phyco fan would have a problem with.

Beravor for example is a made up character, no one cares. So why not make some interesting foes that are not just the same variation on the exact same theme. If this game goes for another year, the packs will be so bland as every single enemy will be exactly the same.

 

Quest Specific Player Card Problems

Another grave problem with this game is a by product of the quest system and in truth I am not sure I can see a way out of this.. but then you are the designers… so work it out.

What I mean here is that to make quests interesting you need to make cards that key off them and interact with them. The problem here is that these cards become completely useless out side of those quests. Your packs cost money and people like to think that their player cards will have a life for the entire length of the game. Examples of this is all those cards that key of "dark" and "underground" these have been great in Darrowdelf, but when you release a pack set in a forest or the plains or w/e then these cards will be of no use.

Through out the entire game there have been forgotten keywords and types. Now yes eventually you can come back to these and release more cards to beef up say Secret, but it is just as likely that we may not see these ever again. This reminds me of how the CoC cycle specific ideas like night and day and others witch were cool ideas are now completely lost and irrelevant to the game.

When we open a player card we want to think that this card will be relevant until powercreep replaces it. What we have with a lot of cards is that we open them and think.. well this card will nvr be used outside of this cycle or that this deck type is completely underdeveloped and not worth building a deck around.

 

Flip a Card, ******* Die!

The greatest problem with this game and the thing that you should really be trying to work out how to remove is the "flip a card, instantly die" problem. This is extremely frustrating for vets and makes new players give up on the game instantly. I can not even count the times that I have been demoing this game (my game store hosts games nights I run LoTr games there now and then) when we have spent more time shuffling our decks then playing the game.

Nothing is worse than trying to teach someone this game saying.. “yeah it is really cool. this is how you play (15 min rule explanation)" and then you loose the quest on turn 2… the reactions is "Well that was anticlimactic and wasn't fun, what other games you got back there?"

Now I understand that as this is a co-op game there is no way you can make the encounter deck intelligent and reactive (or is there, your the designers.. .. . ) so you need powerful encounter cards in there. Still this flip a card game over is really frustrating and also off putting to new players.

As a deck construction game many people play this game for the deck building. I have spoken to many experienced deck builders and much of the consensus is that no matter how well you play or what you deck build there is just no way you can get over this problem. When people deck build they like to make decks that function in a synergistic way and have a good chance to win. The flip a card gameover means that no matter how much time you spend on a deck you can loose the game in an instant and this makes deck builders fell that they are completely wasting there time.

What ends up happening is that people build decks that simply ignore these large threats and then just "hope" they nvr turn up. So you are not really playing the game you are just hoping for a correct flip order from the encounter deck. Some quests like say return to mirkwood for solo players could basically be played by just shuffling and dealing the encounter deck, if you had a good draw.. you win… if not you lose.. as NOTHING you did in game made the slightest difference besides drawing questing characters.

while the entire section quoted is nothing but troll bait aimed at me and other lore fans, this is my thread so i feel no problem in side tracking for a moment.

 

what exactly makes you think that tolkiens works is 2 dimensional? perhaps the literally millions of copies sold..? (well maybe, taking the likes of potter and twilight we can see success often = drivel)…..or perhaps it is the fact the he is the man that every (and i do mean every) fantasy author now draws from, more often than not just copying LOTR in a very poor manner..or maybe its the fact it took 12 400 page history books to explain his writings, with countless others over the years?

let me ask you- have you even read the books? and i mean properly read them? not that i have anything against those here who havent, it would just do more for your opinion if you had the knowledge to back it up- knowledge which would tell you that GW products are FILM based, and most of the stuff that wasnt in the film was from the so called '2 dimensional books' anyways

the only content that was released outside of the film and the books is just basically straight lifted from the warhammer products and pasted with tolkien style names

perhaps you think that after decades we should just create a new race to mix things up abit? yeah why not…lets call them spawns of the great demon splurge shall we, and its ok in the lore side as tolkien didnt explain all of middle earth to us….

perhaps you should realise that in tolkiens work there are many many creatures, good and bad, some  inbetween. and if you had looked at GW's LOTR products you would realise that they are infact doing EXACLTLY what you complain FFG is doing- just basic variations on the same thing- mordor orcs, mordor archers, mordor uruks, mordor uruk captain, isengard uruk, isengard orcs….you get my point…and dont tell me it isnt like that because i collected GW LOTR for years until it was exactly what you said- the films had ran dry and they couldnt properly release decent content so it got boring….difference with this game here is that it has designers who actually know tolkien lore

the actual variation you are referring to (mostly evil men and creatures of lands we havnt been anywhere near to) would end up a joke if FFG just slotted them in there- i mean you actually want a Mumak wandering around in the mines of moria? becuase thats what it would have to end up like. FFG are just giving us the foes that you would naturally encounter in the places we have been to-which given that tolkiens main foes are orcs, has ended up orc heavy.

while my recent player type poll had nowhere near enough results to draw any firm conclusions, it can be seen that the Bilbo theme type players came out on top..so while the likes of you can go around saying things such as your post, remember that i am not the only 'pathetic lore nerd' here…and ffg has to (and thankfully does) take that into account

Thanks Rich ^^^^ aplauso.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/aplauso.gif] I thought about saying something but figured you'd do it better, being more well versed in the material. I'd like to add the fact that beyond the stories, the mythology, etc. themselves lies very deeply held beliefs and opinions of Tolkien himself (a Roman Catholic). Read some of the philosophical studies written on Tolkien; Middle-Earth is our earth, with all of its complexities. The mythology is chock-full of detail (the languages, the mythology, the tales, the histories, etc.). To write it off as "two-dimensional" is insulting to Prof. Tolkien, one of the great linguists of the twentieth century, to his legacy, and to his family.

If I may ask booored, what is your idea of "three-dimensional" source material?

I won't disagree with you that some things might be improved upon, in fact I've made similar points about quests on another thread.

richsabre said:

It is 2 dimensional, in fact it is deliberately so. Everything is black and white, there is good and evil, right and wrong, heroic and villainous, and the villains ALWAYS loose as in for all the threats that mordor pose they get there ass kicked in every single major encounter.

His entire novels are based on the theme of the duality of nature, good and evil, with defined and right and wrong and what is worthy of protection and what is not. Bad guys are bad guys, evil twisted monsters that server no function than to be evil twisted monsters. One monster is interchangeable with any other as there only function is to provide a counterpoint to the heroic. Evil is evil for the sake of evil in his stories, there is no depth or exploration into what evil is or what motivates.

So while the realm of men and elves and to some extent dwalfs are well rounded and defined the bad guys are just generic monster "A". Little to no though in them… this translates into the game as there basically being 1 type of monster for the entire game.

. I'd like to add the fact that beyond the stories, the mythology, etc. themselves lies very deeply held beliefs and opinions of Tolkien himself (a Roman Catholic). Read some of the philosophical studies written on Tolkien; Middle-Earth is our earth, with all of its complexities. The mythology is chock-full of detail (the languages, the mythology, the tales, the histories, etc.). To write it off as "two-dimensional" is insulting to Prof. Tolkien, one of the great linguists of the twentieth century, to his legacy, and to his family

 

exactly, and just like in said religion "demons" or w/e have no motivation other then being demons. Evil is evil for its own sake, there is no depth there.. they are evil.. end of story.  Being evil is in itself a explanation of motive… (witch it is not)

Tolkien was a academic not a story teller. The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings ARE NOT his works (so to speak). It is well documented that he was pressured into writing Lord of the Rings and only wrote the Hobbit as a exercise in narrative as part of his studies.

He was a linguist who specialised in folk lore and had a particular love of the European epic poems. His legacy and work is not these short novels, but the languages and histories going back to the creation of the planet and life itself. If you read his letters and notes it reads like the start of the bible.. just linage lines.

reading the Return of the Shadow, the first history book documenting the writing process of the trilogy, several times tolkien claims the characters took off the page, so to speak, and even he was shocked at things such as gandalf not turning up to meet frodo after his capture.

that to me certainly speaks of a man caught up in the narrative….most authors have reasons for writing other than being an author, even the greats started for other motives

It is 2 dimensional, in fact it is deliberately so. Everything is black and white, there is good and evil, right and wrong, heroic and villainous, and the villains ALWAYS loose as in for all the threats that mordor pose they get there ass kicked in every single major encounter.

His entire novels are based on the theme of the duality of nature, good and evil, with defined and right and wrong and what is worthy of protection and what is not. Bad guys are bad guys, evil twisted monsters that server no function than to be evil twisted monsters. One monster is interchangeable with any other as there only function is to provide a counterpoint to the heroic. Evil is evil for the sake of evil in his stories, there is no depth or exploration into what evil is or what motivates.

So while the realm of men and elves and to some extent dwalfs are well rounded and defined the bad guys are just generic monster "A". Little to no though in them… this translates into the game as there basically being 1 type of monster for the entire game.

what about Saruman? wasn't he good before he was bad? and what about the corrupting influence of the ring? that changed characters, too. what about the other istari? they were all "good" but only gandalf stayed true to the mission. what about the growth of aragorn from reluctant leader to accepting his destiny as king?

both being, there is grey in middle earth. maybe not a lot. certainly not a lot when compared to more modern literature. but, it is not *entirely*  two dimensional, as you claim.

being honest i find many (scratch that- all) modern fantasy books tiresome- theyre too multi-dimensional…yes there is such a thing!

i like kicking back in middle earth and its tradiational style tales…..i cant think of many authors that do this anymore

and yes, i guess no one will get a book published anymore without ten thousand 'main' characters….just a shame really

i mean look at RJ's wheel of time- its just so **** complex it isnt enjoyable- by the time you read one book, you have to remember what went on 1000 pages back before going to the next!

"Continuity in The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game

While Shadow and Flame presents an entirely different challenge from the third scenario of the Khazad-dûm expansion, some players have wondered if the game’s ongoing story can bear a second encounter with the Balrog. Lead developer Lukas Litzsinger addresses these concerns:

The stories told by Khazad-dûm and the Dwarrowdelf cycle are related, but distinct. If this were a movie or a piece of literature, Khazad-dûm would be the prologue, the part of the work where the major conflict and villain are introduced in a visceral way. The party that adventured through Khazad-dûm is not the same party that ventures through the Dwarrowdelf cycle; indeed the only evidence of the former party may now be the burned and frozen remains that lie under snowdrifts as referenced in quest stage two of The Redhorn Gate.

Now as we draw near to the end of the Dwarrowdelf cycle, the Nameless Fear which drove our first party of adventurers out of the mines takes center stage. And this time he brings the fire."

It's not black and white, gray is everywhere. Gandalf is "Grey" (in name and metaphorically) he won't take the ring as he would be corrupted. Frodo is grey in that he continues to fall, he is not perfect (in fact at the end of LOTR he fails in his mission and keeps the ring). Boromir is grey, he has good intentions but is brash (his card represents his character well. Aragorn is grey, he has ignored his birthright (in a way it was taken from him) and deceived leaders of various kingdoms for years, serving them under different guises. Theoden and Denethor both have deep flaws.

Your claim is a gross over-simplification, and misunderstanding, of the plot of LOTR. Who is White in the tale? Bombadil is really the only one who might fit.

Villains don't always lose. What about the death of Boromir? The corruption of the Shire? The fall of Isengard? The destruction of the Pelennor and Minas Tirith? All of the death and suffering and murder of the innocent?

As far as Evil being evil just because do you mean to say that the motivations of Attercop are the same as those of Shelob? That those of Saruman are the same as Sauron's? What about Wormtongue? Denethor? The evil men of the South? The men of Khand? All are driven by different motivations (often having been deceived by another).

The material is not black and white Tolkien lived through (and fought in) WWI before The Hobbit. He lived through WWII before LOTR was completed. These were not times of black in white in our world, certainly not Europe (isn't this when relativism began to extend reach over the West)? Likewise Tolkien didn't create a black and white middle-earth (which again is our earth, read the appendices).

characters. I'm talking about how "evil" is a blanket term that has no real meaning.. other than evil. All we know of the evils motivation is that they want power, but then at the same time Aragorn is setting up the unified kingdom, witch is also a power gain.. I only bring that up as the story of how aragorn is rising to power has reasons, there is a why, and motivations and struggles and that we can point to giving that story depth.. while for the evil guys.. itr is just.. they are evil.. end of explanations. I nvr meant to imply that there isn't depth in the "good" races.. there defiantly is, but there is nothing for the other side, nothing at all..

but NOT discussed… fans can impose reasoning, but there is nothing in the stories that goes into these very interesting ideas you yourself just brought up. Why are the guys form the south on mordors side? Good frickn question.

Denethor, btw wasn't evil, we was just terrified.

Wormtounge and Sarraman are the most developed of the "bad guys" and are a thinly veiled metaphoric visualisation of the politician and the political zealot. The entire "turning their back" thing is a fantastic allergy for political power. After the war I think Tolkien was very disenchanted with politicians and there words witch lead the world to such turmoil.

 Hello FFG!

Here's my feedback. This is the only card game I have played, I only expected to buy the core set but I have now bought all the packs and am fully addicted to it. I would very much like to buy a new adventure pack each month and would be disappointed to wait several months for a deluxe pack. Saga expansions for the Lotr novels would be great, but I love the side quests too. I bought the game because it's Lotr, but love the single player/co-op aspect. I can't always play with other people and most of my competitive board games gather dust.

My favourite part of Lotr is the characters, and I would love to see more focus on specific heroes. Legolas' bow allowing him to attack twice, Gimli's axe allowing him to defend twice, for example. I also don't mind several versions of the same characters and am eager to see a tactics Aragorn one day. The card I am looking forward to the most is Andúril.

I would love the next cycle to focus on men, either Gondor or Dúnedain, with some powerful synergies and weapons. The most recent player cards have been brilliant but I feel the game has become easier. I would love to see the difficulty level shoot up in future quests. My favourite quest was foundations of stone. Getting split up in co-op was a great experience. Future quest dynamics that show this level of innovation would be fantastic. I am looking forward to a combat heavy 'battlefield' kind of quest, with swarms of enemies to cut through. Now it is getting easier to quest I would like longer quests with more quest cards. The long dark is an example of a quest that can be won very easily but putting all effort into questing.

And finally, very random, but I would love to see Event cards called 'I do not counsel prudence!' and 'You do not know your peril!' but, I'm sure they are coming. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

To me there are two pillars that hold up fantasy literature:  Tolkein and Howard.  I've read a lot of bad and some good fantasy since discovering those two some thirty plus years ago, but none better.  Good current writers are G.G. Kay, Tad Williams & sometimes Sean Russell.  Oh yes, Orson Sott Card also tells a decent yarn now and again, but they, along with Moorcock, Leiber, Pratt and others are simply building on the foundations laid down by Tolkein and Howard.  Yes, I've missed some good writers, but I have intentionally omitted many more.

Lets look at what happened in this thread. richsabre makes a post about the state of the game and then booored makes an on topic and constructive reply raising three points that in my opinion are spot on and needed to be said in such topic. Then richsabre makes an unprovoked personal attack on booored, calling him a troll followed by a demand for him to explain his position in further detail on something completely off topic. booored dose this, and while I think booored is a bit miss guided here he expresses his position clearly as well as doing exactly what richsabre asked him to do and the thread has a chance to turn into a very interesting subject about good and evil and modern vs classical fantasy fiction. But no. Instead there are three posts of personal attacks on booored. The most venomous form mr.thomasschmidt.

There is no doubt that booored has a caustic tone, but I have never, ever, seen him attack anyone personally like the way you lot have behave in this thread and other threads he has posted in. I also think he is one of the most helpful and insightful posters on this forum. He defiantly gives strongly worded opinions, but he also gives sound advise, card evaluations and brings up interesting points about the meta game.

You lot should all take a step back and lay off him because form the point of view of this casual forum frequenter, the problem I see around here is you lot, not booored. It was you guys that degenerated this thread and some others I have noticed, by attacking booored for no reason that I could work out. It was richsabre's unprovoked comments that started the degeneration of this thread. Now booored isn't all with out blame, he has said some harsh things now and then and he did do a mild snap back at richsabre comments, but I bet for every one thing I have seen him do, I have seen others say worse and say more to him. It is a wonder he is as civil as he is considering how you lot treat him.

well it is here that you are in fact wrong- im not going to comment on the fact that you think id be idiotic enough (and pathetic enough) to troll my own thread, but i am going to say that booored has indeed said some very unkind things to several people on this forum over the months, myself included…and unlike you i have checked and posted on these boards every day for over a year

i dont know where you come from, but here in england we (in general that is) are polite if talked to in a polite manner…but if talked to in the manner of booored…well what else is there to do but to act as we did?

saying we  were '**** sucking' was hardly insightful, and totally uncalled for, as is 90% of the things he says….i could go on but ill let the vast majority of the forum members speak for my point

besides…you coming into my thread and talking about anything other than the intended subject is trolling anyways- so i guess youre just as bad as the rest of us right?

I also have to agree with the critiques relating to the lazy and poor design behind "flip card and die" mechanics that are in the game.  It just about breaks the game, and needs to go the way of the dodo.  There are much better ways to challenge players.

 

And also, I too am concerned that when I see certain keywords that they are geared towards what appears to be that single cycle.  That is also bad game design.  It is hard enough opening a pack and seeing multi-player only cards when you play solo, but I can overlook that one to some extent (I feel it still is on the sloppy side of things…more about filling packs and selling cards than good design), as one never knows when a friend might pick up and play.  

 

But I stress, the game almost got shelved by the one-card nukes in the encounter decks.  Said friends would do the same.   

 

And it would be a shame for such a unique design with great artwork to flounder in that regard.  I am still playing, but another bad decision could easily knock me out of this - and card games in general.  I see a tendency towards bloated and sloppy design, that is not quite tolerated in other genres.  

 

When it works though…it really works.

First of all, I can't see how you make a constructive on topic answere when you start with referring to all previous persons who wrote in this thread as "FFG **** suckers".

How's that constructive in anyway? And while rich can certainly speak for himself it snaps when I read that kind of uncalled for remarks.
 
Secondly, if you take and read this thread alone, then yes, we might be harsh on booored. Might. BUT this is just one of MANY that he has participated in and most of them turns out this way, mainly because he shows little to no respect whatsoever for other human beings in this forum. If you "lurk about" here as you said, and I don't mean to offend you in any way, you would know that by now. Both booored and Glaurung are frequently pissing everyone else off by how they address others and share their destructive criticism. No constructive here. Though, it seems that Glaurung has learned from this and learned to respect his fellow players.
 
Thirdly, I wouldn't call a person helpful when he in one thread accuses players of being idiots for the lack of understanding the game and then in an other thread rises a question that is clearly stated in the rule book!!! But you can decide that for you self. I like the way you try to make me the troll though :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] that, according to you, it's us, the people who try to respect our fellow players and unprovoked holds a nice tone, that is the trolls.

i'll also add that i honestly have noticed an improvement in the tone/tenor of the boards, specifically from booored and glaurung lately, i just didn't want to say anything earlier in risk of jinxing it. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

i think they have both, by and large, been much more polite, i've found their insight more helpful lately, and when they offer criticisms in a non-caustic manner, it's all the better.

so, no, i don't want to be hard on any one person. it's just, perhaps b/c this game is "co-operative," i expect even more cooperation than i do from maybe some other types of games.

booored said:

 

Well it might be some time for some constructive criticism instead of just FFG **** sucking…


Let me start with saying FFG is doing a great job with this game, it is easily one of the best card games I have played, and I have been playing card games for over 20 years now and have entire shelves of cards form various titles. The co-op angle is just fantastic, and while gives this game life where many of the other games are simply nvr played any more. Still I think this is a good time to offer form thoughts on what is weak in this game.

 

Boooring Monsters

One of my main problems with the LoTRlcg is that there is so little variety.. Would be nice to see some new monsters now and then instead of orc version 40 and troll version 20 … The packs are just so similar.. Some of the real stand out packs for me is like the watcher for example were we had some small respite form the constant encounter cards that are exactly the same as all the other encounter cards we have already seen.

Now I understand there is some need to stay inside the Lore of LOTR but you need to find a balance between the LORE and fun gameplay. Tolkin's work is pretty 2 dimensional so we understand that you haven't got a lot to work with. Still if you look at say the LoTR Game from GamesWorkshop you can see many interesting and fun monsters that fit nicely into the Lore that only the most pathetic phyco fan would have a problem with.

Beravor for example is a made up character, no one cares. So why not make some interesting foes that are not just the same variation on the exact same theme. If this game goes for another year, the packs will be so bland as every single enemy will be exactly the same.

 

Quest Specific Player Card Problems

Another grave problem with this game is a by product of the quest system and in truth I am not sure I can see a way out of this.. but then you are the designers… so work it out.

What I mean here is that to make quests interesting you need to make cards that key off them and interact with them. The problem here is that these cards become completely useless out side of those quests. Your packs cost money and people like to think that their player cards will have a life for the entire length of the game. Examples of this is all those cards that key of "dark" and "underground" these have been great in Darrowdelf, but when you release a pack set in a forest or the plains or w/e then these cards will be of no use.

Through out the entire game there have been forgotten keywords and types. Now yes eventually you can come back to these and release more cards to beef up say Secret, but it is just as likely that we may not see these ever again. This reminds me of how the CoC cycle specific ideas like night and day and others witch were cool ideas are now completely lost and irrelevant to the game.

When we open a player card we want to think that this card will be relevant until powercreep replaces it. What we have with a lot of cards is that we open them and think.. well this card will nvr be used outside of this cycle or that this deck type is completely underdeveloped and not worth building a deck around.

 

Flip a Card, ******* Die!

The greatest problem with this game and the thing that you should really be trying to work out how to remove is the "flip a card, instantly die" problem. This is extremely frustrating for vets and makes new players give up on the game instantly. I can not even count the times that I have been demoing this game (my game store hosts games nights I run LoTr games there now and then) when we have spent more time shuffling our decks then playing the game.

Nothing is worse than trying to teach someone this game saying.. “yeah it is really cool. this is how you play (15 min rule explanation)" and then you loose the quest on turn 2… the reactions is "Well that was anticlimactic and wasn't fun, what other games you got back there?"

Now I understand that as this is a co-op game there is no way you can make the encounter deck intelligent and reactive (or is there, your the designers.. .. . ) so you need powerful encounter cards in there. Still this flip a card game over is really frustrating and also off putting to new players.

As a deck construction game many people play this game for the deck building. I have spoken to many experienced deck builders and much of the consensus is that no matter how well you play or what you deck build there is just no way you can get over this problem. When people deck build they like to make decks that function in a synergistic way and have a good chance to win. The flip a card gameover means that no matter how much time you spend on a deck you can loose the game in an instant and this makes deck builders fell that they are completely wasting there time.

What ends up happening is that people build decks that simply ignore these large threats and then just "hope" they nvr turn up. So you are not really playing the game you are just hoping for a correct flip order from the encounter deck. Some quests like say return to mirkwood for solo players could basically be played by just shuffling and dealing the encounter deck, if you had a good draw.. you win… if not you lose.. as NOTHING you did in game made the slightest difference besides drawing questing characters.
 

 

 

 

1) I think they're doing a good job so far, but this is my first LCG, so I'm probably not an expert for this. I love all the KD Goblins which all presented a threat on their own. TRG had some cool monsters, TWitW was tentaclicious, the Nameless Things,  the four Carrock trolls, etc. The opponents could be a bit harder though. Would love to see some orcs on drugs or some human opponents (can also be on drugs).

 

2) I have no problem with this, as I'm building decks for each scenario. I'd like to see more secarios like SaF that make excessive use of the secrecy keyword, but even so the mechanic seems to work better after new Glorfindel got released.

 

3) I know exactly what you mean, but I'm not sure what can be done without maing the game too easy. I liked the mechanic implemented in FoS, in which the brutal cards only came into play in the last stages of the game. I'd also like to see an official ruling that allows players to mulligan a card during the setup (or to choose one of three - like Branching Paths). However, players should get a punishment for using a mulligan.

 

 

And finally my personal suggestion:

 

Create a tactics attachment/ally that gives me money when I defeat an opponent. And some kind of tactics torturer who can turn an enemys damage into progress would be nice.

Improvement of tactics should be a priority of future deck design. I at least would like to see more resource engines for this sphere. Killing means looting after all.

 

Thanks for starting this thread. I share your opinion and ratings given in your first post. The only issue I don't agree with is "quest content". After FoS and SaF it should be at least 8/10. In fact I like all Dwarrowdelf adventures. Only TLD was a bit disappointing (not bad, but not quite what i expected). RtR is perhaps too easy, but there should be scenarios like this for beginners and for testing decks (and just to have some fun).

Also, I think that adding weapons/attachments to opponents like they did with Durin's Bane is something they should keep in future scenarios. And I miss nasty travel effects like in the Mirkwood cycle.

yes, looking at the rating i gave i probably agree with you, and i admit this thread was a little premature (given that i dont have S&F), but overall i agree this cycle is far more refined than mirkwood, which is suppose is to be expected

I think most of the calls for improved Tactics options pertain to the sphere's function in solo games. Yes, Tactics is probably the weakest sphere in single-player games, but I think it might even be TOO strong in groups. When it doesn't have to worry about questing (paired with strong Spirit/Lore support), it just carves through enemies. Boromir + Support of the Eagles or Hama + Feint just gets silly. Enemies like The Watcher and the Carrock trolls just get swatted like flies.

That being said, it does need a boost to make it a more viable solo option. Some hero/ally that gets a willpower bonus as it kills enemies would be a nice start. Your "bounty" idea (+resources for killing) is also good. 

I agree that the encounter "attachments" are a neat development. In that vein, I also enjoyed Gathering Ground from TLD (the treachery that attaches to a location). Fresh, innovative encounter mechanics are always fun. 

Also, without delving into the issue of who trolled whom, I agree with booored that the "reveal and die" issue could be improved. I think many of the killer cards (Sudden Pitfall, Sleeping Sentry, the Gollum treacheries, etc.) can be mitigated with smart play, but there are still times when they just wax you out of nowhere. This is frustrating, because it feels like the encounter deck just got lucky. I think the FoS solution is a fairly good one: have the really brutal cards shuffled in towards the end of the quest, after players have a better chance to set up (and thus a better chance to overcome those powerful effects).

I'm not a big fan of attacking people personally who I think attacked other people personally, so…

 

As you've been playing the game for more than 20 years I assume you're at least, uh, 21. Old enough to say

As a solo player I hate all multi players. You suck and destroy the game for me! Stop having friends! lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif]

 

Ok, I have to admit that Erebor Battle Master was a big improvement for tactics/dwarf decks. One of the best player cards in this cycle. Now we only need more tough enemies like Durin's Bane that will hack each spirit hero into pieces. One reason why I love TWitW and SaF is because they'e made for tactics. Boromir in action is SO much fun!

 

Btw, you can add "Leaping Flame" to the list of cards that destroy you immediatly. The ***** came up twice in round 1 while everyone was questing.

Yeah, every scenario seems to have that one treachery that is head and shoulders above the others. Leaping Flame is "that treachery" for S&F. You can build up a nice little strategy to tank that one Balrog hit per round, but it's harder to handle two. Then everything starts to unravel when that extra attack goes through. 

S&F and TWitW are basically a giant middle finger directed towards Spirit players.

someone else suggested something like this earlier in the thread, i think (it may very well have been you, i don't recall as i type this) but the problem lies in that the attack phase is after the quest phase.

maybe you all are envisioning something like for every enemy killed by this hero, he gains +1 willpower?

not only does that seem too powerful (and no elegant way to keep track) i'm not sure we'll see something like that (but then again, maybe we will). at the same time, to get him up to any decent willpower (i would think this hero needs to start at 0 or 1 willpower) he has to attack for quite a few rounds, at which time you might have gotten too far behind in questing.

i'm certainly no card designer, but it seems like it might be difficult. i think cards like blade of gondolin and legolas' ability are the way to go. after all, we already *do* have tactics cards that place progress (forget needing willpower to only then have to compare it against threat in the staging area!) directly onto quests via the results of combat. sure, it's only two cards at this point but that, to me, seems to be the way to go.

besides, i don't think we really want our best fighters questing anyway, it's just not their function. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Lore's function is to heal and to draw cards, but still it has some good fighters. Ok, I also don't want too much questing power for tactics, but either they have to create stronger enemies so that it pays off to have a 0 WP tactics ally, or they have to offer other ways to make progess with a tactics deck. Legolas is a very creative card in that way, and I'm sure there are other ways to increase tactics's power without making it too badass.

One example of what I consider to be a good enemy is the Orc Drummer. He's not too strong, but can be a pain in the ass because of his card effect when he's in the staging area and because of the shadow effects when he is engaged. A tactics deck should have no problem to eliminate him, but a spirit deck has to gather some forces to overcome the 3 DEF.

I think I suggested a hero/ally who gets +1 willpower each time it destroys an enemy (or I may have done so on another board), but I doubt I'm the first to make that recommendation. It would actually be pretty easy to keep track of--just attach the destroyed enemies facedown (similar to Eagles of the Misty Mountains). Limiting it to once per round would be fine, since my proposal would offer the added bonus of permanently removing those enemies from future reshuffles. It's just one idea, though, and I'm sure there are more creative solutions. Alternately, an ally could probably go without that restriction, since allies are considerably more difficult to ready. 

At any rate, I do think Tactics needs to have SOME questing ability in solo games. It doesn't need to be great at generating progress, but it should have a way to combat the threat in the staging area. Without some modicum of willpower, Tactics players find their threat jumping up every quest phase. I agree that cards like Legolas and Blade of Gondolin fit the Tactics "flavor," but they don't really alleviate the problem of skyrocketing threat. On the other hand, Hail of Stones and Hands Upon the Bow work fairly well as "pseudo-willpower." The ability to pick off enemies in the staging area might be the way to go, but I still think Tactics needs a small dose of raw questing power.

 Well, it's been a while since I posted, but I might as well chip in !

The game has gotten better, no doubts there. There is an apparent power creep both for the encounter deck and the player cards, but it hasn't been steep enough to eclipse some of the more powerful core power cards. However, I will share Booored's preoccupation with insta-death cards. Cards like Sleeping Sentry are just killers and IMO, there should be ways to make the game tough without making it hang on one precise moment in the game. Redhorn Gate is a good exemple : if you play for the first time, you might get a bit aggravated by the transition from stage 2 to stage 3 of the quest deck, especially if you flipped Snowstorm. As soon as Cardhradras come up as the active location, Heroes and Allies drop like flies. So you have to gear up your deck and playstyle to prepare for that exact moment, that time when all your efforts might go crashing down. Granted, I felt a lot of pride when I finally beat Redhorn Gate, but still, it can be frustrating and not all players have my patience.

Synergies are now way more interesting, and combos are starting to evolve out of the card pool, which is awesome. In the beginning, each card more or less standed on its own except for a few cases. Now, a lot of variation, combos and synergies are possible. My only gripe would be that some keywords are still left in the dust (Noble, for instance), while others (Dwarf comes to mind) are getting waaaay too much attention.  They are slowly making Noldor and sylvan better, but they should work on it more, as well as Hobbit.

Finally, as Starhawk77 pointed out, the wording hasn't really gotten clearer, and since they are trying to find new imaginative mechanics for each quest (which is good), it often generates question the rules have trouble answering. The new FAQ is a good thing, but it was overdue. A new, clearer rulebook would be a good thing in a new printing of the core sets.

Otherwise, this game is still awesome, and I am really eager for the next deluxe expansion !!!

one thing i'm liking about the most recent cycle is the way they are bringing in totally new mechanics, like secrecy, ambush, and when our characters get washed away by the water and end up in completely different staging areas -- stuff like that. and there are some new little bits and pieces in the hobbit box too, with the extra hero and treasures. i hope they keep that going into the next cycle, and bring in new rules. i think that is what keeps it fresh and interesting every time a new quest/box comes out. because the game is pretty simple otherwise, always following the same phases. there's not a lot to it -- its just draw cards, quest and fight, draw cards quest and fight, draw cards quest and fight. it could potentially get a bit same-old same-old.

but they seem to have a load of ideas at the moment. let's hope they keep them coming.

 

one other wish that i have… is if they could find a way to make the game play longer. some games only last a few rounds. i know there is a sentence in the old rule book which suggests that future quests might allow our threat to go above 50. maybe there is a way to use that to make them play longer.

agreed- one quest i love is road to rivendell- that first 1B with 20 quest points is great!

what id like to see is more quests that let you really get through the decks, both player and encounter

Not sure this is a good idea. 2 player games take around 40 mins already and a 4 player game can go as long s 2 hours. That is plenty long enough. You culd alwyas just double the quest points needed if you like I guess but I think they have the pacing of the quests pretty much bang on.

Maybe more "travel" quests like RtR then? I think a good one every cycle or two wouldn't be horrible…

yes possibly, as long as they dont over do it with locations like emyn muil….something like emyn with more enemies and a couple less locations would be great. i think thats probably what RtR was anyways

or make the locations interesting. something random if you travel there, or a reward for traveling there, etc. just to travel and clear only to travel again is boring. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

For my two cents; I am loving the game so far, and I believe it is on a good track. I share the same concern as many of you do about "instant-kill" cards from the encounter deck being too strong. In multi-player games however, such "overpowered" cards seem to be necessary in order to properly balance the difficulty level…this inevitably means that solo mode becomes harder.  The solution? I have no idea. 

I am also an advocate for keeping the Adventure Packs on a monthly release cycle following their Big Box Set.

Happy Questing! (or not so happy…"When Revealed: All characters in play DIE!").

 I also like longer quests. I use Aragorn a lot, and when you get the sword, stone and Faramir down games can end pretty quickly.

How long would the march across Gorgoroth be? Or the climb up Mount Doom? I wonder how they will portray the burden/corruption of the ring?

I would love a cycle to centre around Mordor, with a quest in Barard-dúr. We never really 'see' the Dark Tower in the book per se, but the allusions make it sound terrifying. Twice as hard as escape from Dol Guldur anyone? Also a quest in Angmar and Carn Dúm would be great. That would tie in perfectly with the as yet unused Dúnedain keyword.

while i am really looking forward to mordor…and expect that we shall get in (or at least outside!) barad dur….i sure as hell wouldnt want a repeat of guldur. twice as hard as that and id be asking for my £10 back….that quest's scaling is aweful

id hope for a more secret type spy mission in mordor, afterall if we go in with swords blazing, we're going to end up fighting half a million orcs……now that may reach dol guldur level haha

 There are so many references to the threat of being brought alive before the seat of the Dark Lord, it would be great to actually play through. It would make fighting a Balrog seem like nothing.

Some king of stealth quest would be great, like if your threat goes over a certain level you draw an extra encounter card.

If you want longer games, S&F is just what you want to play. I completed my fastest game in 10 turns, and on average I nedd 13-15 turns to complete the scenario (and managing around 20 characters and attachments is time consuming).

I think you were clear to point out that you felt that game was improving.  I think most of us do. 

While I wouldn't have replied with the same intensity that Troy did, perhaps, I do think you might be overlooking some of what they HAVE done with the enemies.  There is no way that every encounter can be full of completely unique baddies, and Tolkien in his own way was careful to show that corrupted creatures made up large races (orcs, goblins, uruks, etc) even as the free people did…  So it shouldn't be surprising that we see plenty of those in variety in the game.

What I think you might be overlooking is the variety of "non-orc/uruk/goblin" that we HAVE gotten…  I believed you mentioned the Watcher as an excellent example.  Well, how about the trolls from the Mirkwood cycle?  Granted not as "nasty" as TWITW, bu they definitely gave us a break from 2-health orcs to mow through.  I thought the inclusion of giant spiders right out of the gate was a GREAT idea, since they weren't really a HUGE element of Tolkien's writings (outside of the scene in The Hobbit, and later Shelob).  Then there's the Nameless Things…  I thought they were well thought out, and definitely a change of pace  (in fact, FoS with it's unique baddies and quest-line is probably my favorite encounter yet, just for its uniqueness…. caveat, haven't played FaS yet).  The Nazgul in MaO (granted, not in the cycle, but still an easily accessible part of the game) definitely fits in this catagory.  As will Durin's Bane.  And Smaug.  And….

I don't think that I need to continue much beyond that…  my point is two-fold, I suppose:  1)  There really isn't a need to "beak canon" to come up with interesting enemies in this game;  2)  I think that FFG has actually done fairly well to date, and by the looks of it will just keep making them more interesting.

LMAO… I was actually going to mention the H-horns, but figured that referencing the "spider" subset might suffice… that is actually one of the enemies that I first truly hated when I started playing, didn't know what the hell I was doing with my deck-building (didn't really have much to build a deck with anyways at that time…), and would just get nailed by that sucker every time he was in an encounter deck.  Bastard.

BUT, at least it wasn't a "boooooooring" orc.  lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif]
