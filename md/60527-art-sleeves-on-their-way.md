Just wanted to make sure everyone saw that the LOTR Art sleeves are shipping to stores as of today! I'm not going to get them myself, I'm happy with the art already on the back of the cards, but some of you may want to get them!

I'm tempted but it might be expensive. Does anyone know how many encounter card sleeves and players card sleeves would you need to house 1xCore + Mirkwood APs + Khazad Dum?

To answer my own question .. it seems you'd need 325 player card sleeves, 378 encounter card sleeves (419 if you have Osgilliath) and 42 clear sleeves (for the quest cards).

not sure i understand the point of these sleeves... imo the real backs look better... and these are just more expensive than normal sleeves

Indeed. Why would I buy a sleeve with the same image of my card's back?
Even if it is supposed to invert things, it is still not cool. :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

 

The Gimli back on the other hand... I wish we see a Legolas or Eowyn back soon!

I don't currently have sleeves and my cards are starting to show signs of wear. I also want to be able to print off custom quests that can contains new player and/or encounter cards. These sleeves make it possible to put them into a deck and not "spot"  the new cards based on their backs.

I was about to buy sleeves with solid backs (possibly black ones and red ones) but if these are a similar price then they seem like a better choice.

yeah if you do not buy sleeves then your card will fall apart after a few years, no question... I get clear plastic ones as I like the official backs.
