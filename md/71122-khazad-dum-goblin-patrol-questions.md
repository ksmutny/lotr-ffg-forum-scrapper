 Just got my copy of Khazad Dum, made dwarf decks for me and wife and gave Into the pit quest a test drive. We lost horibly, (Patrol leader with Goblin tunnels shadow card 4+3 attack killed my Gimli on second turn, and it only got worse), but I have few questions, about interaction with stage 2b - goblin patrol, and its forced effect to discard enemies:

1. How it interects with cave torch forced effect?

2. Goblin swordsman shadow effect (add to staging area)

3. Watchfull Eyes treacheary card 

 

what happens to enemies that should go to staging area from effects of those cards?

 

Bonus question: How does Lightless pasage shadow effect work? How can you deal combat damage to attacking enemy? In my understanding of combat you can only do damage while attacking, and not while defending.

#1: CT causes you to discard, then add, so the enemy isn't revealed, thus it'll go into play.

#2: Again, not revealed so into play.

#3: WE says reveal, so any enemy would be discarded instead.

Bonus: Shadow card remains for the duration of the combat phase, so after the enemy attacks and reveals LP as shadow effect, you can't kill that enemy by attacking it with your heroes as all combat damage will be cancelled for that combat phase.
