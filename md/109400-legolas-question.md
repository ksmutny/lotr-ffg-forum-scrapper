Ok, so if i use Legolas' ability and there is a active location does the progress go on the active location or the quest card?

                      Thanks ahead of time

The progress always go to the active location.

 

There is one exception that is the card the says to put progress, saying to bypass the active location

Or if the active location is immune to player's cards effect, then no progress is put by Legolas.

just to be clear.. no progress is put down AT ALL. Having a immune location does not mean the tokens skip it and go on the quest card.

Are you sure? cuz' it says

Response: After Legolas participates in an attack that destroys an enemy place 2 progress tokens on the current Quest

Yes, games mechanics state that progress token are put on the active location first.

 

It's in the faq :

> Q: Does the effect on Legolas (CORE 5) place progress
> tokens on an active location, if there is one?
> A: Yes. Always place progress tokens on an active
> location instead of the quest, unless the ability
> specifically states to bypass any active location.
> 
>  

 

Concerning what Booored and I said :

 

> Q: If there is an active location with the text "Immune
> to player card effects" when Legolas participates in an
> attack that destroys an enemy, do I place 2 progress on
> the active location or the quest?
> A: No. When Legolas' ability would put progress on
> the current quest, if there is an active location, it puts
> progress on that location instead. If that location is
> immune to player card effects, it ignores Legolas'
> ability. Therefore, no progress would be placed on the
> active location or the current quest.

This is a game effect as well.. so same goes for Longbeard Elder or anything with similar progress token placement on the "quest"
