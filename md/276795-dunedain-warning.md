Is it legal to attach multiple copies of this card to the same Hero?

Most certainly. Any attachment that does not say "limit one per hero" may have multiple copies attached to a single hero.

Keeping in mind that hero can have up to only two restricted attachments.

Which is of course one of the advantages of the Dunedain Signal attachments - they don't tend to be restricted, so can stack nicely with Items, most of which are.
