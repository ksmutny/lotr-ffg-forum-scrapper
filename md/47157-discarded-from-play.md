Everything else says to discard or place in discard pile except when you explore.  Exploring (on pp 15) says to "discard from play" Does this imply the explored card is removed from the game, not to the discard pile?

I don't think so, since the discard pile is considered "out of play". So, if something is being discarded from play, it would be going into a discard pile. If something was being discarded permanently, I would hope it might say something like "discard from the game".

"Discard from play" means that you DISCARD it FROM PLAY.  Where do discarded cards go?  That's right, the discard pile.

LOL :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] nice and concise answer :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] THAT's right :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] 

 

but he's right, though... a card has left play when in the discard pile... there is no "exile" territory or out of game territory such as in magic the gathering, etc.
