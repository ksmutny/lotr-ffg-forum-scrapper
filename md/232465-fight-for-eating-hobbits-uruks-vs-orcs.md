Found it! it was a spoiler when we got the news that Nightmare Treason of Saruman was out.

Yeah, I was sure I had seen that on a nightmare card but was too lazy to find it.

Quite brutal visualisation for lotr, isn't it?

Could've been an alternate art version of Infighting as well.

@J.C.:

While truly no images for a hobbit bedtime story for childs, I would not say that those two are on par as the first picture. I think, that what kind of disturbs me is direct violence against an human looking beeing.

I dunno. Orc slicing off another orc's head feels like something kinda regular to me. A crazed man eating a rat alive on the other hand is disturbing. Corpses of innocent villagers burned alive in their homes - deeply traumatizing sight.

I'm just happy when I'm looking at the first picture. It's so good seeing Uglúk behead an orc!

So am I the only one who parsed the topic title as "Fight over whether we should eat hobbits, orcs, or uruk-hai"? (Pro: Uruks have a lot of meat on them. Con: They bite back. Pro: Hobbits' robust diets give them a high nutritional value. Con: They're surprisingly good at disappearing. Pro: Orcs are numerous and easy to hunt. Con: They taste like terror and malevolence.)

They don't taste very nice, do they, precious?
