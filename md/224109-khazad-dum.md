Hi all I'm new to the game and was looking at getting some expansions. I've noticed the Khazad-dum set is out of stock and I'm struggling to find anywhere except for silly prices.

Question is has it been like that for long and is it liable to come back into stock?

It is on the reprint list. Might take a month or two, but it will be back.

That's good news I'll hang fire on it and work my way through the adventure packs

Playing in release order is great fun and FFG seemy pretty good at keeping this game on the reprint list.

Enjoy :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Does anyone know if at this point reprints come in the clamshell or in the boxes?

Reprints of Adventure Packs come in the clamshells. Reprint for Expansions come in their boxes.

Thanks. I had meant the APs. About halfway through my collection of Against the Shadow they switched from those nifty deck boxes to the annoying plastic clamshells.
