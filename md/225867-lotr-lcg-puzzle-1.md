It still hasn't been answered perfectly yet. Go ahead and be the first!

Je ne comprends pas ce qui doit être fait, mais moi aussi je peux répondre dans un langage bizarre.

I'm not sure how this is supposed to work. Do we start with any number of cards in our hand and any number of resources on our heroes? Can it be over multiple rounds? Or is it only first round planning phase? Can we determine the order of the cards in the deck?

Nice! I thought I had, but then read the replies to some of the others submitted and realize what I'm missing now. Good puzzle!

I just assumed you had each necessary card in hand.

Good questions, I should have added more details.

 

Just imagine it as a regular game. You start with a random deck and random hand. At some point in the game, play Shadows Give Way. There are no time constraints, so you can simply wait to draw into anything you need.

We can't edit comments on ringsdb can we?

Afraid not. If you want to upload another solution, I can delete your previous one.

Nah, I'm ok with my answer.  Was just going to give it a bit more detail.  Thanks though.

When I have my firstborn child, I want to have as much free time as Seastan.

Well, that was fun! Although I almost feel like the correct answer is: Impossible, since the encounter deck will destroy me before I set up the combo.

When you have your firstborn child you will have much less time than you do now.

Do you listen to COTR? Seastan just had a kid, hence the joke.

Ah.  No.

If you don't take a moment to unwind every now and then you will go insane  :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]. That, and killing some time during the day until I get to go home and see him again!

 

But in seriousness, you should expect the rate of youtube videos, which I record at home, to take a steep dive.

The good news is that when they leave for college you suddenly have more time than you know what to do with.  (But less money.)

Remainds me of an old tale about sage making a sad man happy.

I think a suitable Seastan challenge would be to see how long of a streak he can build power decks......without using Steward of Gondor.

You can use the website mentioned in the ringsdb post to decode the comments over there. That should make things a little bit more clear.

Sorry to necro this thread. I have returned to the game after a longish break and am enjoying having a crack at the puzzles you devised while I was away. I suspect they are well above my paygrade, so to speak, but I'll give them a crack!

I did the Balin's Revenge puzzle first, in which the player starts with all cards in hand and unlimited resources. Earlier in this thread you said about the first puzzle:

If there are no time (and presumably threat?) constraints, then presumably at some point the player will have drawn their entire deck and will have a infinitely large pool of resources.

Should I approach this puzzle with that assumption (i.e. I can play any card, at any time, without needing to consider its cost), or does my solution need to be along the lines of: "in my starting hand I draw card X, Y, Z... I spend 1 of Denethor 's resource to play X. Denethor now has 0 resources."?

EDIT: Nevermind, I have just gone ahead and posted my solution on ringsdb. Any assumptions that I made about which cards are in hand, and my heroes' ability to pay for them, are explained in the solution.

Thanks for your attempts at the puzzles! Sorry that I do not have time to address them all individually. But if you take a look at the other responses at ringsdb you can find out what you did (or didn't) get right.

Thanks Seastan. I'm going to give myself a passing grade :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] 

Although one of my solutions to Balin's Revenge used Palantir in an unorthodox way. Rather than scrying the encounter deck first to ensure that the test failed, I did a blind test and named the "hero" card type, on the assumption that there would not be 3 heroes on top of the encounter deck :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]
