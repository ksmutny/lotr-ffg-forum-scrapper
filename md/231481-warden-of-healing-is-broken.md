Look the following 3 photos.

The combo of these 3 cards is unbelievable.

Heroes Gloin and Elrond in combo with Warden of Healing. My deck is very similar to "Seastan's Gloin" deck.

I won 3 game on 3 played against the scenario Ruins of Belegost, in solo mode.

When you finish to setup Gloin after 2/3 round, it is no longer necessary to defend!

Put all damage on him and heal him with the Warden.

It is possible an infinite loop.

In my last round, I was engaged with 11 enemies! But this is not a problem for this combo.

My question is: do you think that the Warden's ability is Broken?

11 enemies without a Dunedain deck? Wow!!!

Warden of healing isn't broken. That combination is. Lots of resource generation can have that effect when paired with other cards.

There are plenty of combinations of cards that share this problem, for example:

Blood of Númenor/Gondorian Fire/Steward of Gondor.

Elrohir/Steward of Gondor.

All of them are exciting at first. But (at least for me) it gets booooring pretty soon. When I look for fun decks on ringsdb I always skip the ones that rely on these combinations. And Outlands. Always Outlands. :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

In what way could that possibly be an infinite combo?

Not infinite, but you are simply immortal

What if an attack deals more damage than you can stomach?

Looks like he put on Boots of Erebor and a Citadel Plate, so as long as you don't have to defend anything higher than 8, you should be good.

## 8 [John Constantine on October 2, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/231481-warden-of-healing-is-broken/?do=findComment&comment=2439893)

In my experience, attack higher than 8 is not something uncommon, especially for the undefended.

In general there is a problem in the game of effects that can trigger without limits per round, but to be honest I'm not too concerned about situations like this. It looks absurd because the deck is designed to do absurd things, whereas another type of deck would look less absurd because it would just kill all the enemies before they can gang up like this.

Speaking as the guy who accidentally discovered this combo back in April (against Ruins of Belegost as it happens)... no. The Warden of Healing is not broken. The combo is broken. If we're fingering a specific component of the combo as broken rather than the combo as a whole, then it's Gloin rather than either of the other two. I can't think of any other case where the Warden gets that kind of crazy broken good.

## 11 [soullos on October 3, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/231481-warden-of-healing-is-broken/?do=findComment&comment=2440124)

Warden of Healing is a very powerful card (detrimentally powerful to the design of new healing cards IMO), because if he were made today, I doubt he would be as powerful. But having said that, it's the combo that is broken, not the Warden.

 

However, I wouldn't be surprised to see a nerf, some x limit per round.

## 12 [Slothgodfather on October 3, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/231481-warden-of-healing-is-broken/?do=findComment&comment=2440894)

It depends on the encounter deck but Warden of Healing can die pretty easily.   He's pretty balanced.  However, if you are spending two resources to heal four damage (due to Elrond and using Warden twice) - you are pretty much just gaining 2 resources according to the Gloin Blood to Resource exchange rate.  So you are honestly no better than Steward of Gondor.  Which is or isn't OP, depending on who you ask.  

 

 

THERE IS NO REASON FOR ANY KIND OF NERF.

But this is not about resources, it's about immortality, isn't it?

## 14 [monkeyrama on October 3, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/231481-warden-of-healing-is-broken/?do=findComment&comment=2440955)

I guess, but the set up on that combo is kinda big. It's not like there aren't other ways to create immortal characters in this game, if you put in the effort. Gloin is clearly the problem with this combo, since if he can't spam resources like that to heal himself via the Wardens then there's less of an issue. I feel like this is one of those 'don't play it if you don't like it' combos, rather than something that needs errata. Would the deck work if you subbed out Elrond or Gloin?

I think Gloin could use the limit, much more than Warden of Healing, personally.

 

People are really unhappy about core set Glorfindel's 1 resource for 1 hp healing, but that's about what the Warden provides with his ability. (Elrond doubles the efficiency of both, but still...)

 

Gloin's ability with (Limit once per round) would still let you entirely tank one enemy without having to defend, but not as many as you want.

It is very potent in solo games, but in a multiplayer game the combination is not that relevant,

## 17 [dalestephenson on October 4, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/231481-warden-of-healing-is-broken/?do=findComment&comment=2442239)

I saw a complaint (here?  BGG) about this combo taking over combat in multiplayer with Song of Mocking.  That's yet one more card for the combo, but it's the only situation where I think the combo existing actually presents a problem to anyone.

## 18 [Slothgodfather on October 4, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/231481-warden-of-healing-is-broken/?do=findComment&comment=2442309)

I still disagree that he should get a limit just because this combo exists.  It is a pretty hefty amount of cards you have to get going to make happen.  Sure, changing Gloin would "fix" this from working - but why is that so important?   You have to go well out of your way to make the deck do this.  But a change to Gloin isn't going to only effect this one deck.  It would all of them.  and that is why it should be left alone.  You want to take the time to build this deck/combo and play the game this way - go right ahead.  

## 19 [Teamjimby on October 4, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/231481-warden-of-healing-is-broken/?do=findComment&comment=2443101)

I would have preferred if Warden of Healing didn't have the readying ability.  Even apart from this semi-infinite combo, he is already the best healing card in the game without the readying ability.  As is, he's one of the staple cards that needs to be included in almost every lore deck.  The game is better when there are fewer staples.

## 20 [alogos on October 5, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/231481-warden-of-healing-is-broken/?do=findComment&comment=2443603)

I'm in favour of a limit on warden of healing more than on Gloin on this one.

I don't find this ridicilous and "immortal" since you can easily get wrecked by shadow effect that could discard ally/character/attachement or boost attack enough to oneshot Gloin.

## 21 [John Constantine on October 5, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/231481-warden-of-healing-is-broken/?do=findComment&comment=2443618)

I wonder how would you limit Warden of Healing? If you put a limit once per round, he won't be able to heal again after getting readied for 2 lore resources, and with his stats, 2 lore resources would be too much for his reading. 

## 22 [alogos on October 5, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/231481-warden-of-healing-is-broken/?do=findComment&comment=2443975)

The nastiest I can think of is "limit: 6 (or whatever) damages healed per phase".

That way you can steal keep heal a tons of damage each turn with a lot of ressources, but no more loop possible.

## 23 [Teamjimby on October 5, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/231481-warden-of-healing-is-broken/?do=findComment&comment=2444005)

Just take away his readying ability.

## 24 [sappidus on October 5, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/231481-warden-of-healing-is-broken/?do=findComment&comment=2444019)

You could also make just the readying part be once per phase/round. But I agree with the others that say that Gloin is the heart of the issue with the combo, not the Warden. How many times have you really abused the Warden's readying in other contexts? Even with Steward on a Lore hero, it's tough to overly take advantage of.

## 25 [Crusaderlord on October 5, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/231481-warden-of-healing-is-broken/?do=findComment&comment=2444043)

With an ever expanding card set eventually some combinations will emerge that are very very good. However most people i suspect would use it a few times and then think its not such a fun deck any more so i will change it and not use that particular combination. I do not think it means any one card is broken, just unsuitable to use in that particular set up but fine to use it elsewhere instead.

 

I change my heroes and decks all the time to keep things interesting, i don't think i would ever stick with one deck just because its very good. I would probably just call that set up an unallowable combination for future use.

How do you make exactly the part with readying once per round?

"The Warden of Healing may only be readied once per round by this effect." It's a bit clunky but it'd do the job.

## 28 [shosuko on October 6, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/231481-warden-of-healing-is-broken/?do=findComment&comment=2445127)

"Then, if this is the first time you've used this ability this round, you may pay 2 Lore resources to ready..."  This same wording is in other cards such as http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Search?Query=first%20time [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Search?Query=first%20time]

 

Also - I think you could just remove his ability to ready all together, and only let him do the healing once.  If you consider it, even with the lore resources cost this makes him VERY effective compared to other cards, so why does he even have the ability?

 

As for Gloin - I've used his ability to take a hit early and get some early resources, but late game if you've got +6-10 hp on him plus the healing cards you've invested enough that I don't see a problem with this combo.  It is risky to let Gloin take damage recklessly before he's set up, and by the time he is set up it's just redundant as those same cards could have instilled other immeasurable defenses.  You can remove Warden AND Gloin even from the equation you can still create some ridiculous tanking with 2 citadel plates, 3 Self Preservation with just Steward and a Song of Battle to set up with.

 

The Love of Tales was a bad combo and needed a nerf because it includes such easy set up, but that is because most of the cards are free / cheap so the rest of the deck is draw, and the combo applied to all 3 primary stats.  This combo is expensive to set up, and all it does is let you absorb damage, it doesn't quest, it doesn't kill, and it doesn't cancel shadow effects.  Speaking of shadow effects, you're also risking taking some much more severe effects by taking everything undefended.

I think this combo is a bit overblown in strength.  I think it could spoil a multiplayer game, but not as bad as ranged / sentinel / blood / fire / steward Boromir can.

He definitely doesn't need errata. Don't forget that after he was printed, they escalated direct damage with archery - druadan forest, anyone?

Cooperative games don't need aggressive errata like a competitive one does. If you don't like it, don't play it - don't try and ruin the card pool for everyone else.

## 30 [PsychoRocka on October 6, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/231481-warden-of-healing-is-broken/?do=findComment&comment=2445175)

He really doesn't need errata. There is tons of setup in this combo and it is something you need to pay lots of resources and cards to set up and even then it isn't foolproof. Also like shosuko said all this combo does is absorb damage, it doesn't do anything but that. So many people lately have been suggesting that cards need eratta just because they are part of powerful combos. Errata is for cards that genuinely break the game, allow infinite cycles, allow you to play your entire deck in one go etc. If we received errata for every card that is part of a powerful combo we would be receiving errata for half the cards in the game!

## 31 [alogos on October 6, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/231481-warden-of-healing-is-broken/?do=findComment&comment=2445261)

In my opinion, he doesn't need an errata yet...

As NathanH said, everything that generate something from other thing without any limit could potentially lead one day to a loop.

 

Warden of Healing as the same problem and seems the stronger card now, but don't forget we got Dunedain Remedy (and I'm also considering Vigilant Guard).. we're quite close to a missing card that could broke everything. (Rest in peace, Blue Mountain Trader, it could have been you...)

> You can remove Warden AND Gloin even from the equation you can still create some ridiculous tanking with 2 citadel plates, 3 Self Preservation with just Steward and a Song of Battle to set up with.

This is true. I've done it with Gimli. The issue though is that if you remove Gloin from the equation it becomes a LOT more difficult to afford all those things. OK, my build with Gimli didn't use Steward, maybe that'd make a difference, but in general I found I couldn't afford the cards and had to rely on Well-Equipped and Vilya to get them into play. And that's with Gimli, so I was still getting some benefit out of all that damage. Any other hero and all you're getting is tanking, and you become super-dependent on other players to actually do things. With Gimli the damage gives you the attack to kill your enemies which makes it feasible, but with Gloin the damage gives you the resources to play your tanking, and everything else.

 

You say by the time it's set up you've invested enough that it's acceptable, but the thing is, basically all the resources you invested in it you got from Gloin in the first place. He has funded his tankiness by his own ability, putting you a hefty chunk of resources ahead of any other setup trying to do this, not to mention you probably did it faster, and then the rest is profits. Also you can engage every enemy in the game and not care about their attacks. It's ludicrous. I'm not saying errata needs to happen, because what's mostly broken is the combo rather than a specific component, but the combo is absolutely broken. If anyone disagrees with that, I can only assume that they've never actually seen it used.

How would seeing it used alter a personal definition of what constitutes "broken"?  I'm reluctant to label any combination "broken" when used in solo play.  It hurts no one, and is self-limiting by virtue of being boring.  I've already conceded that this combination could be annoying in multiplayer in conjunction with song of mocking, but even there it requires cooperation for self-repairing Gloin to take undefended attacks for other players, since the controlling player for Song of Mocking is the player defending, not Gloin's player.

 

Gloin's a bit unique in that he can (shadows permitting) take an infinite number of attacks.  However, it's not unusual at all to construct a super-defender hero who can in practice defend against "every enemy in the game" and not even care about shadows.  From a certain point of view, watching a souped-up Bilbo in Lonely Mountain completely nerf Smaug with a Staff of Lebethron and an ample supply of defensive attachments and/or Dori's help may be "ludicrous", but broken it is not.

 

What I'm most curious about the self-healing Gloin is what proportion of quests he can actually take all attacks undefended.  Stacking shadows can get to insane attack values, and a number of shadow cards are worse when taken undefended.  Taking undefended also reduces a fair number of my favorite cards for cancelling or avoiding shadows.  (To be fair, it also nerfs the shadows that give a choice between a bad effect and taking undefended.)  Setting up Gloin like this wouldn't have very much value in Journey to Rhosgobel, for example.

This combo can trivialize the majority of quests in solo or multiplayer to the point where the other players don't have to do anything but quest. There are certainly quests where shadows can severely punish you for taking attacks undefended, but that's easily solved a couple different ways (Balin, Silver Lamp).

 

Assuming your group can make it to turn 2 or 3 without losing heroes, the Gloin deck should be fully online. People talk about this being a difficult combo to set up but it's really not. It's basically just two cards (Song of Wisdom or Narvi's Belt, and Warden of Healing). This has become easy to pull together with Master of the Forge and Heed the Dream. As for the HP bonuses, just throw in Boots from Erebor and Ent Draught and Gloin can be at 7 HP for cheap, which is enough to take an unlimited number of strength 6 attacks and a single strength 7 attack (by defending). The citadel plates can wait until later when the boss comes out.

 

A few months ago I put together a deck specifically to get this combo running quickly. It becomes functional by turn 2 almost every time: http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/1671/turn-2-glin-machine-1.0 [http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/1671/turn-2-glin-machine-1.0]

 

I'm not going to comment on what, if anything, needs errata. I just want people to know what the combo is, what it can do, and how easy it is to set up. Some people seemed skeptical of its power.

It's probably Heed The Dream that is the problem, and will probably be true for many silly decks. Not that it matters, since it's relatively easy for players to police decks like this if they don't like them.

In my opinion Warden is not broken. The combo Gloin+Elrond+Warden+Narvi's belt / Song of Wisdom. Plus in multiplayer you need another card, Song of Mocking, and more copies of it the more players there are.

For me it is a very specific combination which does not justify to give an errata to Warden.

I actually found that Song of Mocking wasn't an essential piece of the combo, at least not early in the game. You just ensure that your Gloin deck has high threat (easy with Gloin/Elrond/Treebeard), then you optionally engage the lowest threat enemy each turn. The higher threat enemies then come to you, allowing you to take at least 2 enemies each round, which a lot of the time is all you need. It does fail sometimes if you get multiple low threat enemies turning up, but if one of those sneaks through the cracks the other decks can normally take care of themselves.
