Does this card lack a sentence ordering to shuffle the encounter deck? As it is, can i see the whole encounter deck in order? ;d

FAQ 1.21, Search Effects,Â [see here] [http://www.lotr-lcg-quest-companion.gamersdungeon.net/#Rule157], is the catch-all for these effects. You have to shuffle.



> Whenever a player searches through a deck, that player shuffles the deck after searching it unless a card effect says otherwise. Players do not shuffle or change the order of a discard pile after searching it.
