## 1 [pmdoug on December 19, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/303540-the-last-two-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=3852517)

We're reaching the end of the current run of this great game, and there are only 2 heroes yet to be revealed. If the general pattern holds, then there should be 1 Spirit and 1 Tactics hero left. Who do you hope the final 2 will be? What abilities do you hope they'll have? What deck-types and themes would benefit from a new hero? 

If the heroes are alternate version of existing heroes, then these are the ones I expect (and/or want) to see: 

 1. Spirit Aragorn
 2. Spirit or Tactics Faramir
 3. Tactics Glorfindel
 4. Spirit or Tactics Sam

If any character deserves to get a hero version in every sphere, then it's Aragorn. I'd also be thrilled if we got an ally Aragorn instead.

Even though Faramir has 2 hero and 2 ally versions (not counting objective cards), I'm not a huge fan of either hero version. A third hero Faramir might be excessive, but he fits well into Spirit or Tactics. I really doubt he'll get another vsersion though. 

Lore Glorfindel has been around since the beginning, but people rarely play him. Spirit Glorfindel is powerful, but he's a polarizing hero that carries a bit of a stigma. I'd love to see a Tactics Glorfindel that shows him in all his Balrog-smiting glory. Also, Noldor could really use a Tactics hero other than Elladan. 

I'm still amazed that Merry and Pippin got 2 hero versions well before Frodo. Meanwhile, Sam still only has 1 (albeit amazing) hero version. I'd probably prefer if the next Sam was in Spirit, but I could totally see Tactics working as well, even though his Leadership version already fulfills that combative role. 

 

If the last 2 heroes are new additions to the lineup, then I'd love to see Spirit Gleowine, Tactics Wilyador, or an Easterling Tactics hero. The Blue Wizards don't really seem to be an option because of licensing, but I'd be happy to have them. 

So, what are your hopes and guesses for these last 2 heroes?

I don't necessarily want a Spirit Aragorn, but I do want a King Elessar Title that removes all copies of Steward of Gondor from play and can only attach to Aragorn or a hero of all spheres.  Or, instead, just a generic, powerful attachment that can only go on heroes of all four spheres.  The games where I do end up with a four sphere Aragorn or other hero, I always think, man, there should be some kind of card that rewards me for this haha.

Traditionally each cycle has at least 1 ffg created hero, so I would expect that, probably the tactics one. The spirit one is probably coming in the last pack and could well be Aragorn.

I think it would be a little crazy to have 4 Aragorns yet only 1 Sam. Sam totally makes sense as a spirit hero too. Aragorn as a neutral or spirit ally would be cool. The tactics hero might be the eagle Wilyador

I am expecting to see a Tactics Eagle Hero - probably Wilyador. I also think we will see another Aragorn in some form, either an Ally, Spirit Hero or possibly a contract that creates King Elessar.

A Tactics Eagle Hero would make me so happy, especially if it were Wilyador and did not step on the toes of running ally Gwaihir.   But, I think if there's a hero Eagle, it's very likely going to be Gwaihir just because he makes the most sense as a hero, and the two ent Heroes that exist are certainly well-recognized ents that already had ally versions as well, rather than an FFG-created-character.  Hopefully if there's a Gwaihir Hero the pack will include a Wilyador ally, maybe a "Wind-Lord" title or "Wind-Lord's Crown" attachment, and possibly even a "nature contract" that has something to do with Creature Allies.

This all seems pretty unlikely, but as someone who loves running Eagles, I can dream...

I'm going with the popular picks of tactics Wilyador and Spirit Aragorn. I'm hoping for anduril attachment similar to its boon counterpart. 

Any idea on abilities for each? I'm scratching my head on both as to what would be worthy but not too overpowered

Maybe not "obvious" picks but "popular" pick

Spirit Aragorn is pretty much a for sure, the eagle hero or the Blue Wizards dual-sided hero are my votes for a second as far as what would make sense and be a final.

I'm on the Spirit Aragorn + Tactics Glorfindel train.

I wonder if we could end with a two-sided Aragorn. Before and after he is crowned.

I am hoping for Tactics Gwaihir and Spirit Sam.

Spirit Aragorn has pretty much been confirmed by MalbeththeSeer in his second post (out of two) on reddit (and he correctly spoiled Lothiriel). I'd be happy to see Tactics Sam, Tactics Gwaihir, Tactics Wilyador, or even Tactics Grimbold; Gondor got a bit of love with Lothiriel, Rohan could use some love, and Grimbold is the most important Rohan character we haven't yet seen as a hero.

Wow I totally missed that in his post initially but you are right. First letter of each paragraph.

On another note, is it fair to assume Gildor will be in pack #4, tactics hero in #5 and spirit hero in #6? Do packs usually follow the same pattern through out the cycle? In this case it would go Lore/leadership, tactics, spirit, lore, leadership, tactics, spirit?

## 15 [MikeGracey on December 22, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/303540-the-last-two-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=3854393)

The first letter of each paragraph does not spell Aragorn... Am I missing something?

Interesting. I have so many favorites in spirit I can't say I'm overly hyped for Aragorn in particular. That being said more heroes are always welcome(which is why its kind of been depressing that two of the heroes here I already own from the collectors😂).

Saruman and his staff redeeming my doomed card collection for multiplayer outweighs losing two heroes though, tbh.

Yeah I felt the same way, I have the 2 heros already from the collectors edition... But oh well, they are good heros anyway. 

Love that were getting several 3 willpower heros this cycle! I feel like there aren't alot of them in the game and with quests getting a little harder all the time its nice to have more options for strong questers out of the gate. If the new tactics hero has 3 willpower (unlikey) then there will be one for every sphere this cycle

## 20 [General_Grievous on December 24, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/303540-the-last-two-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=3855587)

Thers aweome that a Spirit Aragorn is coming, I hadn't seen that particular preview before. The 3310 part is interesting though, also the title 100 years is the blink of an eye. Are they referring to age? Aragorn is 88 in the books timeline but lives until his 200s, so perhaps it could be reflecting him in his role as king (Gondor trait?). But the 3310 is that a stat line? Because they have never deviated from keeping the same stat line, unless it perhaps is a spirit ally version? Then 0 willpower, 0 attack, 3 Defense, and 3 health would fit if done backwards. Spirit always needs more defending strong allies.

Or if it's referring to his hero version which is more likely I have no idea about the numbers, unless they are going to bump his willpower and/or another stat up to 3. Really curious to see what they do with him but would love to have something that works with Arwen hero and helps Gondor out too. Perhaps exhausting him to draw the top card out of your discard pile once per round as long as it costs 1 or less? That would help their swarm while not being broken.

I'm curious of the overuse of the word "break". Maybe an Andúril attachment...

I would be shocked if there wasnt an Anduril attachment with a spirit aragorn hero. Probably guarded, spirit. If it's anything like its Boon version I will be happy. But that's a pretty stout stat and action advantage, even for a guarded card. 

## 23 [MikeGracey on December 25, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/303540-the-last-two-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=3855841)

Technically Anduril wasn't made until after the time-frame of this game, so having an Anduril attachment doesnt actually make any sense... Unlike the guarded cards like orcrist, which was actually made before the time-frame of this game. Of course Orcrist was buried with Thorin so still weird to have it as a card but at least it was physically made at the time

3 spirit

3 attack

10 hp?

That is a ton of HP if so haha.

I would say Spirit aragoron is likely to have his standard stat line (why should they change them now?) and an ability sinergizing with gpndor trait. This last version would be king aragorn representation so a gondor synergy fits. 

I bet for a spirit attachment for his crown.

Anduril would be more fitting as neutral guarded card to be playable with all aragoron version.

It's a little surprising that the second pack will probably come out before the announcement of the fourth pack.

A lot of unusual quiet around FFG releases lately, even in more active product lines.  For the first time in X-Wing's history, they just had several upcoming products canceled (second edition releases of a few ships) and apparently the official X-Wing app is not going to be updated to include Epic Battles or Huge Ships.  On top of this, it's been one of the longer periods of silence with regards to what ships will be releasing in the wave after next.

Hopefully a delay in the Fourth Pack's announcement doesn't necessarily translate into a delay in the Fourth Pack's release date, but if it does I suppose there's a chance it takes the better part of 2020 to get the Vengeance of Mordor cycle into player hands.

I am also only comparing this cycle to the last. Before the Wilds expansion was released, they had already announced two packs. The fourth pack was announced about a month before the 2nd pack came out. Now, they have the second pack slotted for January 10th and the 3rd pack slotted for some time in February. I would love a rapid release schedule, even with the upcoming break. But the pacing... seems odd.

Well, the Harad cycle had similiar pacing issues, but it got released eventually. And since there is nothing else after this cycle coming for quite a while (if at all), I do not expect FFG to release their products earlier.

Perhaps a minor point, but Evan Johnson from FFG did release an amended statement re: the official X-Wing app and huge ships/epic play… Essentially, they are working on adding such support to an all-new app.

Sourced from the FFGOP Facebook page, an entry back in late November:

For now, all tournament-legal ships are still supported by the current Squad Builder app. For huge ships and epic play, we recommend that you use the points lists provided on the FFG website for now.

EDIT: Turns out they pre-announced today that the Wave 7 announcement will be next week as well.

Ah, this is what I get for not following FFG on Facebook.
