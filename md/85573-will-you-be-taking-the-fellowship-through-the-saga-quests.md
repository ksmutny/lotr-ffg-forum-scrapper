The thing i'm most looking forward to in the new "black riders" expansion, i think, is being able to take the whole fellowship through it, from start to finish. from bag end all the way to mount doom.

i hope they release some of the heroes as allies too, like they did with all the dwarfs, so we can take all 9 members in just two hands.

playing the game solo with two hands, and being able to have all nine members together will be great.

i might even order the hands so i can seperate them up when the time comes. so instead of playing the "black riders" box two-fisted, i might start it with just one hand -- frodo, sam, merry and pippin (thats why we need them as allies too), and then only start playing two-fisted when they get to rivendell. then we can switch back to one hand when the story demands it, after frodo and sam go their seperate ways.

being forced to include the frodo card in quests that dont involve him will be a bit of a bummer, though

yeah certianly…..fatty may also come along instead of merry or pippin just to see whats would have happened

man i cannot wait to get some more hobbits…..and i really want to see bombadil, though it obviously poses lore problems…but i suppose we could have an event card such as 'bombadil's farewell' which gives a defense boost for a few turns after playing it

i reckon the old forest is going to be a print on demand quest, like those other gencon ones. maybe it wont be difficult enough for that, though. all the other ones have been really tough

i think its more likely that the old forest and barrow downs will be locations in the quests, rather than specific scenarios…which is a real shame as they are my favourite chapters (im re-reading the fellowship again….dont ask me how many times it has been now)

i would like to see them as scenarios, even if they have to be POD ones

The whole fellowship is really only together for a few pieces of the story, so I'm not overly concerned about that, personally.

But I am looking forward to taking all four hobbits on the same quest.

Meh, I'm pretty sure they will use those locations and events for the scenarios of an Adventure Pack cycle like those that emulate numerous events and chapters from the fellowship of the ring (like redhorn gate, watcher in the water, the dead marshes, shadow and flame, etc etc.)

hopefully you are correct!

Haahahah, I didn't think it like that though, I hate when they do that, it kills the possibility of it being in the saga expansion it belongs, and it would be better if they invented completely new quests for AP´s.

either way is fine with me….i think both have their strengths.

if we get them in saga packs we get the true authentic feel of the storyline, but if we get them in alternate quests its like taking our own trip through middle earth.

Does anybody now if we can change heroes and keep boons and burdens? In hobbit we can't, but fellowship changed through their way

I also wonder if gildor would help only in black riders, or he would follow the fellowship to moria and next quests

Of course, I'll try. I did it with The Hobbit and it was fun.

it is likely that we will have to keep the same. also to your second question, im not so sure….some arent permanent are they?

This!

 

That's what I like about this game

It says in the preview that Gildor had an encounter card back, implying he's part of a specific encounter card set instead of seperate and added to your deck. I think he'll only show up where he's meant too and not in any what if's. (apart from the fact we have him as a card so we can take him with us if we want).

That makes sense to me… the only problem I have with that is that while it's cool to use diverse heroes to recreate an existing adventure from the books, it's a **** shame that you can't do that with the actual characters from the books (and with that I mean Frodo with the one ring, as representing a part of his journey… unless they come up with a rule that lets you use those cards in normal scenarios). Sure, having Elladan and Elrohir fight the watcher in the water and enter Moria is amazing, but I would also like to do it with the fellowship including Frodo bearing the One Ring, and I already know I won't be able to do that.
