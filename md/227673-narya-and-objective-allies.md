Objective-Allies are legal targets for Narya, right?  My first thought was "yeah, of course they are.  Objective-allies are still allies," but I wouldn't be terribly surprised if "Objective-Ally" was different from "Ally" for the purposing of targeting like that.

 

I'd rather not play through Isengard again, so hopefully my initial thought was correct. xD
