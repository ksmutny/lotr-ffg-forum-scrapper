All right am I missing something.  I just tried to build a tournament tactics deck with two core sets and I was unable to reach the 50 card min and still keep the max of three of the same card.  I ended up with 43 cards.  help!

You have to mix spheres to build a full size deck. Remember each sphere only has 15 different cards in the core set.

Thanks.  So we have to wait for the adventure packs to build a one sphere deck.

Yes after a few packs there would be enough unique cards of each sphere to do so. But an all tactics deck would be a bad idea for solo play.

They say there will be 3 copies of 9 different player cards in the first couple of sets, so I'm predicting there will be 2 cards for each sphere and a new neutral card per set.  So after the first expansion you should be able to do a single sphere legal deck with 2 core sets if I'm right.

I don't think we'll see many neutral cards. If it's like the other LCGs, the number of cards per sphere in an AP will vary slightly, evening out when the cycle is complete.
