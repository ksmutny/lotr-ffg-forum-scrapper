built a deck with beravor, eowyn and glorfindel,

 

the passage through mirkwood: it works great, just pile up the progress tokens as fast as i can, couple that with 'the galadhrims greeting' getting threat down 6 and i sailed through

 

journey along the anduin: starting to see the decks weakness here, poor defense, that hill troll just wipes them out! going to perservere as i love the heros

I like that combination as well, I think people trying to find one deck that is the best deck are going at this the wrong way, each scenario presents different challenges and the optimal deck to solve scenario 1 is not the same for scenario 2.  That being said, in the Core set, I really believe that Spirit is part of all of the best deck options out there (at least been my experience) since they own threat reduction and Eowyn is the best quester, and both are critical to beat scenario's 1 and 2 in Solo mode.  I prefer Spirit / Leadership because it allows more Gandalf abuse.  I can't think of a deck with a threat start of 30 or more that would stand a chance vs scenario 2 without Tactics for early evasion and Gimli beatings.
