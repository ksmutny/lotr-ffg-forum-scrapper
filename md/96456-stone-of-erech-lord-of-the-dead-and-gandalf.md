Hey, so about a week ago, I was playing stone of Erech and was facing off against the Lord of the Dead. I put gandalf in but didn't use any ability as his text box was considered "empty.". But, because it was empty, I also didn't discard him at the end of the round as usual. Thus, the next round, using him and questing everyone, I was able to win. Is that a fair understanding since the lord of the dead renders all but trait in a characters bo empty. I think so.
