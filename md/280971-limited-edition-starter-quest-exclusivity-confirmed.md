Luke says at 3:30 that the two quests can only be found in this box.

If these exclusive quests tip you off the fence, or you are an obsessive collector; you might want to get that pre-order in fast.

Oh man, $120 for 2 quests and alt art cards, man, that's steep for me. I wish I could find someone to split the digital content with.......

At the moment, yes, it's the only way to get those 2 quests. But I would be shocked if the 2 player starter set wasn't released as a stand alone product at a later date, maybe a year from now. Let's hope it's a timed exclusive.

If true, this is disappointing. I don't have the funds to buy this, but I'd like to be able to get the lcg content (even if the swag remains exclusive) at some future time.

As much as this is really not the best of news it at least makes me feel a little better about spending so much money on international shipping to get the Limited Edition Collectors Bundle..... The main reason I ended up doing so was out of fear that the quests would not get released separately and it looks like that will indeed be the case. A little bit of a weird decision by FFG, everyone who plays with the cards is going to want those two quests and only a select amount of the community will actually ever have them... ?

If there is anyone out there who wants all the digital content but not the physical aspect of the bundle I would very gladly sell the digital part of the bundle at a discounted rate or would swap it for some physical resources like alt art cards, playmats or whatever. I imagine most people would prefer the opposite and want the physical aspect and not the digital aspect though so certainly not expecting much interest!

I hope it's not a permanent decision.  I don't see the point in developing an alternate entry point to the game that could be sold at a cheaper price point, comes with better pre-built decks than the core, complements a single core set well, and then confining it to a one-time-only collectors edition bundle with a much higher price point.

I do think it makes sense to make it exclusive to the collector's edition during the period that is for sale, though.

From the unboxing stream on Twitch, the LE starter set had a UPC on the back (at about 14:41 here [https://www.twitch.tv/videos/291467877]). That's promising for being sold separately in the future.

I was on the pre-order bit of the website, trying to just see how much shipping would be to me in the UK. It didn't seem to update the expected shipping when I put in my address (and kept reverting back to the US for country). Did you directly pre-order through FFG? How much was shipping coming in at?

As I was already signed in on my Asmodee account it automatically filled in all my billing and shipping details so it had already put in the shipping cost from the get go.
Pretty sure it still said estimated shipping cost when I put all my details in to be honest and I don't think it ever locked in a definite amount. I haven't been charged yet so I am guessing I'll get an update as to the final cost closer to them shipping the orders out perhaps?

As far as the estimated price given the product was $99 USD and the shipping was roughly around the $50 USD mark.  I'm from Australia and this is around $207 AUD roughly.

120$? ?

Yeah, and FFG is usually so customer friendly, with few heartless cash-grabs. Hopefully this is just Asmodee being devious. We may see even less support from ANA now that Christian T. Petersen is stepping down.

The precise quote is: "You get two exclusive quests that can't be found anywhere else."

He didn't say that they'll never ever be released in another form, so this can be interpreted as marketing hype-speak that isn't technically false—the quests ARE exclusive to this product, for now. Which we already knew.

Whether they in fact will release a separate two-player starter at some point is another discussion, but I don't think this interview really stated anything new.

Possibly. Hopefully.

I was just charged so shipping should be soon.
