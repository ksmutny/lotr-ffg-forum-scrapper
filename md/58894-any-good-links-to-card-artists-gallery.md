i like looking at the full pictures that are used on the cards, so does anyone have any links to some good galleries?

right now im just googling the artists names but many do not have sites (or i cant find them if they do)

i know that TIziano Baracchi has one that has beautiful artwork on it, but im cant really find any others

ps i did find this one of THE HIGHLANDS (emyn muil) thought i would share the link as its amazing

if i had the money my house would be FULL of  prints of the artwork

Although not everyone cares to use Facebook, the COTR podcast's page has created a gallery of high resolution card artwork from around the internet that anyone is welcome to view here [http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.276502995703833.67621.276494475704685&type=1].  It includes every piece of card art that we've come across or has been brought to our attention, but I think that unfortunately, lots of cards are still under non-disclosure agreements, or just plain aren't hosted on the artists' respective websites.  What also stinks, is that so far as I know, next to no card art is available for purchasing as prints, save for a few exceptions like Gimli and Wandering Took.

Nice. And I'm looking for "Radagast's Request" artwork. Maybe someone saw it in such high resolution?
