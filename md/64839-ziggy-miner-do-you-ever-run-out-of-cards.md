# [Ziggy Miner - do you ever run out of cards?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/64839-ziggy-miner-do-you-ever-run-out-of-cards/)

 I drew 2 ZM cards in the opening hand and I was loving it - often using them both for resources.  But by the end of the game (which I won pretty easily), I was down to 3 cards in my deck.

Has anyone run out of cards using ZM

Not if you play with will of the west and dwarven tomb!

Running out of cards isn't much of a problem, as long as you manage to draw enough of the right cards (if all your Gandalf and Sneak Attack get discarded, you'll obviously regret it). I'm considering not playing Will of the West anymore. In solo mode, at least, you often reach a point where you stop using miner's ability anyway, and the rest of your deck should be enough to tackle the quest.

Multiplayer is a different story, as there's always more stuff to do with extra resources (giving them to a partner via Parting Gifts) and Will of the West can also be used on another player, if needed.
