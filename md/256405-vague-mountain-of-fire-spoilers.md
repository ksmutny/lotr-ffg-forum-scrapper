Looks like Rosie Cotton, with the Tactics hero being Tom Cotton (anyone call that?!).

Looks like Tom Cotton will be a decent hobbit defender, with 1/1/3/3? stats as our last unspoiled hero.
I think Rosie is 2/0/0/?, as our last unspoiled ally.
3 cost Leadership event with what looks like Aragorn's banner, 1 cost Tactics event, looks like 1 cost neutral attachment (+ Guthwine and Orc Disguise, which says attach to the Ring-Bearer) round out the remaining player cards.
Elladan and Elrohir are the only Spirit/Lore cards in the box.

Looks to me like Tom Cotton has 8 threat, so his threat is sum of stats.

I agree Rosie is 2/0/0, and at 2 cost is a good value.  Can't make out the text when blowing up, but I'm pretty sure it's a response.

I think it's an action with exhaust, actually. So, yay, Leadership Faramir decks...?

## 8 [Estel Edain on August 16, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/256405-vague-mountain-of-fire-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=2930772)

I think Rosie's ability is an action, since it seems shorter than "Response" in Elladan/Elrohir's text box. I think the Leadership event is a Quest action, and the Tactics event is a response.

Here's what the announcement article said about the player cards from this expansion:

> Quote
> 
> The Mountain of Fire is loaded with new heroes, allies, events, and attachments that truly convey the awesome resolve of those noble and daring Men, Elves, Dwarves, and Hobbits that stood at the end against the forces of Mordor. [...] These are but two of the nine different player cards (three copies of each) that you'll find in The Mountain of Fire, and while these Elves may help you carve you way through your enemies, you'll find other cards to help you raise your spirits and evade the evils around you.

The Leadership event is probably related to "the awesome resolve" of the Free Peoples, and perhaps to raising spirits. Orc Disguise likely helps to evade enemies. I have no idea what the Tactics event will do. The neutral attachment looks like it could say "Attach to a Hobbit hero" and its image seems like this one from The Road to Doom preview article, which suggests it will relate to resolve or raising spirits:

mec62_sam-frodo.png [https://images-cdn.fantasyflightgames.com/filer_public/47/cd/47cdf23e-c1c6-4a02-b43d-84a9fddc3455/mec62_sam-frodo.png]

Caleb is keeping to his custom of having non-Fellowship heroes in the Saga boxes share a trait with allies in the Saga boxes (Gandalf, Bard and Beorn are exceptions, but we have Théoden-Háma, Treebeard-Quickbeam, Faramir-Anborn, Damrod-Mablung, Éowyn-Grimbold, Beregond-Imrahil), but this time there's a sphere swap. When Elfhelm was spoiled as a Tactics ally, I doubted that we would get Gwaihir hero and Meneldor ally (as I had previously expected) because it wouldn't really make sense to have Meneldor as the only Leadership eagle. (I expect we will still get Meneldor at some point.) It makes sense to have Elfhelm be Tactics, because Tactics is more of a Rohan sphere than Leadership, and it makes sense for Rosie to be Leadership (even though that doesn't match her dad) so that she can fit into a deck with Sam. Depending on whether her ability can be interpreted as inspiration from afar, I might include her in my thematic campaign for the Mount Doom, based on this quote:

> Quote
> 
> Never for long had hope died in his staunch heart, and always until now he had taken some thought for their return. But the bitter truth came home to him at last: at best their provision would take them to their goal; and when the task was done, there they would come to an end, alone, houseless, foodless in the midst of a terrible desert. There could be no return.
> ‘So that was the job I felt I had to do when I started,’ thought Sam: ‘to help Mr. Frodo to the last step and then die with him? Well, if that is the job then I must do it. But I would dearly like to see Bywater again, and Rosie Cotton and her brothers, and the Gaffer and Marigold and all. I can’t think somehow that Gandalf would have sent Mr. Frodo on this errand if there hadn’t a’ been any hope of his ever coming back at all. Things all went wrong when he went down in Moria. I wish he hadn’t. He would have done something.’
> But even as hope died in Sam, or seemed to die, it was turned to a new strength. Sam’s plain hobbit-face grew stern, almost grim, as the will hardened in him, and he felt through all his limbs a thrill, as if he was turning into some creature of stone and steel that neither despair nor weariness nor endless barren miles could subdue.

Later, as Frodo and Sam are running out of water, Sam remembers "the cool mud about his toes as he paddled in the Pool at Bywater with Jolly Cotton and Tom and Nibs, and their sister Rosie. ‘But that was years ago,’ he sighed, ‘and far away. The way back, if there is one, goes past the Mountain.’"

Master of Lore predicted that we might get a Tom Cotton hero and Rosie Cotton ally a long time ago [https://masteroflore.wordpress.com/2015/01/31/anticipating-angmar-awakened-the-heroes/], referring to Farmer Cotton's role in the Battle of Bywater. (Scouring of the Shire looks likely as a PoD for this year's Fellowship event.) I didn't predict them for this expansion, but I noticed the art [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/254410-new-art-spoilers/] for Tom and Rosie Cotton recently, and anticipated that we might see them soon:

> The second from the right image in the bottom row might be art for Rosie Cotton, and the old character next to Arwen might be Gaffer Gamgee or Farmer Cotton.

Quest spoilers:

Several of the  encounter cards have two eye icons, and one has three, so Fortitude tests are relatively high variance. (I'm pretty sure this is what Caleb was referring to in the video when he mentioned that he was expecting some angry emails, since it all comes down to a Fortitude test at the end.) There's a Nazgûl enemy in the Mount Doom encounter deck, so in Epic Multiplayer Mode the Aragorn players can potentially reduce the threat in Frodo's staging area by letting the Eye of Sauron flip to Frodo's side for one round (hopefully with few Nazgûl moving to Frodo's staging area) and then flip it back, taking all the Nazgûl and keeping them.

(If Caleb is careful to avoid having more than eight Nazgûl in play at a time, I expect we'll only have two Nazgûl enemies in each of the encounter decks for the last quest, since there might be four copies of Wraith on Wings in play.) Several of the Orcs have negative effects when they engage you. A deck that keeps its threat low has easier fortitude tests and doesn't have the penalties from engaging enemies, but threat builds up in the staging area. As Caleb said in the Team Covenant video, it will be difficult to keep threat low, since threat is increased by 1 each round for each non-Ring-bearer character you control. I look forward to seeing how Gollum works, including how he can help with the final fortitude test. Reaching the conclusion of the saga campign is exciting, and tomorrow we should have full player card spoilers.

Looks like quite a few (for a LOTR LCG expansion) secondary Hobbits in this box. I think a Scouring of the Shire scenario somewhere is pretty much guaranteed. I mean, giving us Tom Cotton who only was important during the Scouring and not giving us Scouring would be a huge bummer. Still, I'm really hyped for Rosie and Tom Cotton. I'm also excited for that "Captains of the West" event or at least that's how I read it (with beautiful art depicting the Gondor, Rohan and Dol Amroth banners blowing). If mono Leadership Gondor wants it, I'll be really happy.

As always, I'm really curious about that neutral attachment. I get the feeling this box might contain a lot of state-of-the-game changing cards (I hope so anyway), especially if that card which looks like it might be related to Secrecy judging by the art brings Secrecy to a whole new level. Or maybe it's a generic courage themed card and works in all decks. Either way, I'm excited for the player cards in this box.

Also, am I the only one who thinks those Snaga look pretty darn big? Power creep anyone?

Rosie Cotton is really good with Sam.  You can wait until after staging to add her WP to the quest, or you can save her to boost Sam's defense or attack.  Friend of Friends is also potentially amazing with Sam.

I thought you would misinterpret.  Margaery gives +3, Rosie one less than that.  So she is Margaery -1.

Well, Rosie has 2 wp, so she gives 2. Margaery has 3 so she gives 3. I meant the whole concept, not exact numbers.

You only need one.  Farmer Maggot.  Have him come in, do 2 direct damage, attack for four then bounce out so he can do his damage again next turn.

I am happy for more hobbits, but I am disappointed I'm not getting a new hero Sam.  The second half of the Return of the King is told from his point of view.  At one point he is the only character.  It's crazy they left him out.

Eight [http://ringsdb.com/find?q=k%3Ahobbit+t%3Aally&sort=type&view=list]. Rosie will make 9. Interestingly, Tom could also revive the long-derided Keen-eyed Took.

Printed willpower would strip any point of using willpower instead of a fixed value.

 

As for Sam, I think they couldn't match the badassery of the original Sam hero or didn't even tried to. Do we have all spoilers for the player cards now, or there are yet some unrevealed?

The hobbit theme start finally to pay off. Pretty interesting to build around. Pretty disappointed that all they can imagine with this feminine character is to only have willpower and boost another one. So sexist. I'm used to more with harad, Amarthuil and more recently :/.

It is not ironic. Designing women (more than men) characters as support and non-fighter is sexist. Be obsessed by being noble is also against my humanism believe. Opposing race and describe some as evil is racist. All those are also on Tolkien original books, but LoTR designer are proved that they feel free to not follow all this and we get a good example as we can see on Harad cycle. Except for the noble thing, since even the only one noble who betray is is in fact not a noble.

So what, you want to have a 3 attack Rosie Cotton? The developers respect Tolkien. They'll create and add new characters to the game that adapt his works to more modern times, which is great, but they will not change already established characters. Tolkien wrote Rosie as a secondary supporting character much like most female characters in LOTR. He also designed the orcs to be evil and irredeemable by nature. Likewise, he created royal characters that are superior by natural and divine law to lesser men, because that's what he legitimately believed in. Hence, a game that is based on such works will transmit some of Tolkien's original discourse. Deal with it.

It's like being a devout Catholic and complaining that a game based on Eastern cultures like L5R is too biased or  too inspired by Eastern and Buddhist philosophy. It kinda comes with the territory.

I think I'd rather have a Rosie Cotton with zero attack/defense than an imaginary female Hobbit warrior.  Rosie's one of the very few female hobbits in the text, and having her as a combatant would certainly not fit her role in the book.  If it were Lobelia Sackville-Baggins, then some attack would be justified.  (I live in hope...)

While Eowyn was a shieldmaiden, in no other Middle Earth culture are females depicted as combatants, and even among the Rohirrim she felt it necessary to pose as male to accompany the Riders.  FFG has provided us with a wealth of female warriors that do not exist in the source material including several whose primary role is combat.  To pretend Rosie's effect is "all they can imagine" for a female character ignores their track record completely.  And to pretend that warriors *should* be split evenly between male and females in a world of melee combat ignores both the source material and actual physical differences between the sexes.

And let's not kid ourselves, Rosie's action is going to be most useful for *combat*.  Getting enough attack/defense out of those squishy little hobbits is a problem, and Rosie is going to be a big, big help.  They just gave us the most useful hobbit ally we've ever seen and you respond by complaining that she doesn't directly crack heads?

The Goblins are evil in the source material and irredeemable.  That's an inherent part of the mythos.

Is this the Gandalf quote you are thinking of?

"And there are names among us that are worth more than a thousand mail-clad knights apiece."

The context is Gandalf speaking of Sauron's perception of their pitiful invasion of Mordor -- it has nothing to do with intrinsic worth as people.  The word "noble" is not mentioned, and "mail-clad knights" are near the top, not bottom, of the social heirarchy.  Further, Gandalf himself is certainly one of those names, and he at least really *is* worth more than a thousand mail-clad knights in battle.

I find this Gandalf quote more representative of his view towards the common people of Middle Earth:

"You think, as is your wont, my lord, of Gondor only.  Yet there are other men and other lives, and time still to be.  And for me, I pity even his slaves."

For all we may wish otherwise, Tolkien wrote Lord of the Rings from the standpoint of a British man, and his works display some of the inherent bias that goes along with that standpoint.

We see this in the fact that most of the women characters in the books remain in the background, and are only ever seen through the eyes of the male characters, as is the case with Rosie who is portrayed mostly through Sam's thinking about her (and we never even hear about a Dwarf woman other than the brief mention of Dis and Gimli's random comment!). Fortunately, there are some strong female characters in Galadriel and Eowyn, and I think that the FFG designers have done a good job in building on that base with characters such as Rossiel, Na'asiyah, Idraen, and Lanwyn. Compared to one another, they actually represent a decent diversity of combat-oriented characters who don't all fit into the same trope for female warriors (e.g. "Amazon").

Likewise, Tolkien struggled to present a world rooted in a heroic mythos, in which generally the common people get squashed until some divine- or fate-appointed savior comes along to beat the big bad. Such mythologies also don't leave space for a lot of moral hand-wringing -- there are the heroes, and then there are the villains. The heroes win (violently), and the villains die. However, Tolkien did clearly learn some humanist lessons, likely as a result of his experience of WWII. Sam famously wonders, of course, about who the nameless Haradrim are that are slaughtered in the Ithilien ambush, and overhears some orc grunts gossiping and griping about their bosses in a way with which I think we can all sympathize to a certain extent. And Tolkien goes to great length in the appendices (and in the character of Denethor) to demonstrate that the Numenoreans are not so perfect or incorruptible as Aragorn might make them seem. The FFG designers have now created two whole cycles fleshing out and creatively exploring the implications of those counter-examples, and I think the world of Middle Earth is enriched accordingly. And the very fact that Sam is the hero of the story serves as a counterpoint to the whole fated heroic mythos. You don't get much more "common" -- nor heroic -- than Sam.

So The Lord of the Rings and the world of Middle Earth, like Tolkien the man, is complicated, confused, and not perfect, just like the world. I think there's plenty of space for critique, but also plenty of space for creative improvement, ways to play around with the source material to imagine new possibilities for characters and peoples that would seem to be denied by dominant tropes and stereotypes. FFG has, I think, done a remarkable job trying to walk the fine line between creatively doing greater justice to Middle Earth's varied peoples (and, by extension, to fans of the game!) while lovingly representing source material that is at times problematic. Rosie Cotton in the books is, for better or worse, a stereotypical domestic woman, notable mostly for her role in Sam's reminiscences and as a "reward" for him to return home for. As an individual character, there is nothing inherently wrong with this role, I believe. The problem is that this role has become a cage for many female characters, limiting the extent to which writers and game designers are able to imagine and create other sorts of roles and personalities for women. In other words, we see Rosie as problematic in the context of a widespread trope against women into which her character happens to fall. So I would argue that there's plenty of room and reason to critique the trope without necessarily critiquing the character of Rosie Cotton.

I thought the idea of the revealed cards having a xenophobic sexist elitist bent was amusing.  Especially in today's political climate.  In all seriousness, I think Tolkien was a little ahead of his time.  There is Eowyn of course, but also Galadriel represents a powerful leadership figure.  I think the orcs are humanized when you over hear them talking about the war effort and how they are gonna pay for their bosses mistakes.  And as for classism in the end the nobles are just a diversion.  The simplest folk, hobbits, are the real heroes.  That's the main theme of the Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit.  And the the lowest class hobbit of them all is the most heroic.  Sams humility is what saves him from the ring at the border of Lord of.  Keep in mind the story was written in the 40s and 50s and I think its progressiveness is kind of advanced.

They'll create and add new characters to the game that adapt his works to more modern times, which is great, but they will not change already established characters. Tolkien wrote Rosie as a secondary supporting character much like most female characters in LOTR. He also designed the orcs to be evil and irredeemable by nature. Likewise, he created royal characters that are superior by natural and divine law to lesser men, because that's what he legitimately believed in. Hence, a game that is based on such works will transmit some of Tolkien's original discourse.

They already choose to not apply Tolkien spirit for some of those things, deal with it. Therefore as one of the FFG customer it could be good to me to complain about some of this problem so they know it could make us loose some sells and think about doing it the next time.

Now I remember that we never got to know what gender or sex Amarthuil is. So when we do our relook of heroes we play we do a male version and a female version of it. I presume you are right when you say Amarthuil is not female but since I got this version it will always stay also female to me ^^.

I agree about the superiority of creating a new fighting hobbit than make a combatant with Rosie. So I rather have a new character. I would not agree on editing view that remind, and so support, an oppressive view of world.

Yep this is an inherent part of the mythos. So I don't expect from the developers to editing some nice goblin that join us. But recall than the original mythos (so not Tolkien, mostly because we don't care about what Tolkien is, the important part is what he express by his books) is xenophobic for that is important to me. 

Thanks for you explanation. My english is not good enough so it lead sometime to mistake. Gandalf is one of the most humanist figure on middle-earth, but he stills carry the legacy of this world: power is given by blood, the major part of valorous people are among the noble one. He never criticize monarchy and by some way help to maintain some.

That is exactly what I'm saying: there is a lot of work made since the beginning of the game (when we have a lot more of tropes). But this one in particular bring us back to the Arwen ally who is only here to support someone. And it is not giving him money or equipment, but being a reward. So yes I say this one is sexist.

You are right about all that. It is good to see that many female trope are avoided recently. It give us to interesting character and don't push stereotype, who lead to a lot of -ism (sexism, racism... ).

Hobbit are still an exception about the noble view of LoTR. We clearly see noble people acting bravely all book long. There is a lot of common people, who dies without being noticed for anything. The best fighters, the wiser, the leader, those who survive battle are always noble. Some noble fails but the one who take all the glory are also noble so who cares? Even the gods give power to some livings so they are superior. Everything act for a view of a majority who must only follow the move of a few. It is not even close to a humanist view of the world.

You were right when you say that trope are in fact what I criticize. It is only by extension that I criticize the character created following those trope. To me it is both an offensive and a pointless character

It is probably true that Tolkien was a little ahead of his time. But I'm not here to judge about Tolkien. I have no personal grief against him. Just told to actual people what bother me, in his writing and even more in this game. When we use what he have done we should be free to choose what please us and what we don't need. There were never forced to print this Rosie, they choose do it and continue to spread sexism by this way. It is up to you to see if you are ok with that or not. They don't print cards for Tolkien, they print them for us, following OUR need.

No, Amarthiul's gender is not ambiguous.  He is referred to as "he" in all the story text. I understand the art is ambiguous though.  I played several times with a couple, and the woman in the couple always played with Amarthiul, believing that he was a "she."  I never said otherwise, because why ruin it for her?  Here I mention it because you were trying to use him as an example of strong female examples in the game, so it deserved pointing out.

Not only sexist, classist and xenophobic, it clearly discriminates culture and religion! All these cards showing warriors in plate armour is clearly leaning towards the crusades and hence towards Christinanism. The fact that we have so little Harad cards (and mostly evil) is telling us Islam is unimportant and evil.

Although I take Rouxxor's point, I also don't think that Rosie Cotton should have been designed as a Warrior type figure - it would have been wholly unrealistic and unthematic to do so bearing in mind her character in LoTR. 

It must be stated that her action is really useful!

I never expected Tom Cotton.  I was so sure we would have a Gwaihir or Meneldor Hero. Or at least an eagle ally in player cards.I hope we should have at least  a couple of Eagles allies objectives... If not, it would be ununderstandable.

I like Tom Cotton. Merry Red, Sam Leadership and Tom Cotton will be a very nice combat deck.

Ring Mail [http://ringsdb.com/bundles/cards/04080.png]

With 2 ring mails (you can put 2 on him, it's not thematic at all but it is legit nevertheless) he is a pretty nice defender ^^

Paired with a Spirit / Lore questing support deck, it can be nice to play. And yes, Rosie is amazing. A very nice designed card, and pretty useful.

Hobbit Cloak would be better under most circumstances - you really should be staying below engagement costs to get best use out of Sam anyway.

Gondorian Shiel is only better if played on a Gondor hero, otherwise Ring Mail is better. It's not a card that I use a lot, but 2 is still pretty cheap so it certainly can be useful. I use it more with Dwarves than Hobbits though.

Well, you'll obviously won't play Gondorian Shield unless you have a proper target. But then again, Ring Mail requires specificly Dwarf or Hobbit, while Gondorian Shield can be put on anyone to give +1 def for a 1 less cost, so outside of gondorian synergy, they are arguably of the same powerlevel given their difference in cost.

If you wish to argue that Gondorian Shield is a more useful card overall, you'd be correct.  It's cheaper, and on a Gondor target the +2 defense is more useful than +1 hp and +1 defense.  Plus it can be put on any hero.

If you wish to argue that Gondorian Shield is strictly better, you're wrong.  On a Hobbit or Dwarf (the only two targets for ring mail) +1 defense and +1 hp is more useful than +1 defense (absent Gondor affiliation).  You can put two Ring Mail on a hero -- you can't put two Gondorian Shields on a hero.  Finally, Ring Mail can go on a *character*, while Gondorian Shield is restricted to heroes.  All these are advantages for Ring Mail -- they aren't big enough advantages to make Ring Mail more widely used, but there are decks where Ring Mail is more useful and decks where both are present.  (My Dori fellowships often have both.)

In other words, we see Rosie as problematic in the context of a widespread trope against women into which her character happens to fall. So I would argue that there's plenty of room and reason to critique the trope without necessarily critiquing the character of Rosie Cotton.

I agree with your earlier comments about Sam being the true hero of the LOTR, and Sam in particular (and the hobbits in general) represent the triumph of the ordinary man in a world were the odds are hopelessly stacked against them (with a little help from Eru...).  It's a reasonable claim that Rosie Cotton is a "stereotypical domestic woman" although I disagree in part with this characterization (I'll elaborate in a separate post) -- but the LOTR is not so much lacking in varied women's roles as it is in lacking women, period.  Even if we accept that Rosie is a "stereotypical domestic woman", the work features *very few* domestic women, and the two most prominent females in LOTR (Galadriel and Eowyn) are anything but domestic.  Rosie has little time and attention in the book and little room to elaborate her character; even if domestic women are a stereotype, there is nothing inherently wrong with her being one, and if in the society in which she lives the domestic role is most common (as Eowyn clearly implies), it is natural and logical to have examples of such.  This is a fictional work; no hobbit women were harmed in its making.  Remaking a clearly patriarchal society to fit modern sensibilities creates a different fictional world, and in a licensed work that's not necessarily desirable.  We need not fret that a positive portrayal of Rosie Cotton is inherently reinforcing negative stereotype.  We need not even necessarily agree with Eowyn's apparent position that domestic roles are inherently inferior to the ways of battle.  Faramir would not.

But domestic stereotype asides, the female-as-reward is a trope that certainly *does* exist in Tolkien's works, and hearkens back to a common theme in fairy-stories, an antecedent more relevant to LOTR than Tolkien-imitating high fantasy.  There is no shortage of fairy-stories where a young man (perhaps nobly born, perhaps not) does some great deed and receives a reward including a woman (there are also stories, though less of them, where the lady does great deeds and receives a man as a reward).  However, I think it's a mistake to look at this trope as a stereotype reinforcing traditional gender roles.  The reward-woman is not "domestic", but a granter of status and wealth.  In the society in which these stories were told, the King disposing of his daughter as he wills would not have raised eyebrows; marriage, especially among the nobility, was a matter primarily of contracts rather than love for both sexes.  The truly noteworthy and even subversive trait of the trope is the message is that *deeds* are an acceptable substitute for *birth*, a humanistic sentiment that the rulers of the time can hardly be happy to see.

Consider a classic and well known example -- the Brave Little Tailor. An ordinary person of humble birth, who upon slaying seven flies presents himself as a mighty hero and gains a princess in exchange for vanquishing a Giant.  Some versions of the tale have the tailor talking in his sleep after the marriage, and the princess (realizing to her horror that she is married to a humble tailor) plots to have him murdered.  Warned by a serving maid, he scares off his would-be assassins with the same combination of nerve and wits that got him to this point.  Having finished the tale, it's impossible to reach any conclusion other than that the Tailor who has become a social equal of royalty through his deeds, is their superior in character.  This is a radical sentiment for the era the story hails from!

Tolkien has two classic reward females in Luthien and Arwen -- in both cases, though the man is as nobly born as possible, they are still hopelessly social inferiors to the women they would marry.  In both cases, great deeds that seemed hopeless to achieve allowed them to accomplish their desires.  But in both cases, it's not simply a happily-ever-after ending.  Both Luthien and Arwen made great sacrifices, giving up their rights as elves to embrace the bitter gift of men.  Both did so completely voluntarily, against the wishes of their fathers.  Luthien herself was no small mover in the deeds of Beren, without her he could not have succeeded and she was clearly the greater of the two in their adventures.  Arwen took little active part in the events of the LOTR and except as inspiration can claim little credit -- and in the end she regretted her choice.  Whatever defects you wish to attribute to the trope, they don't fit the classic mold.

Eowyn herself becomes a reward for Faramir -- and he for her.  Faramir was not the reward she desired.  But he was the reward she deserved.

Rosie Cotton, however, I don't think fits into the reward trope at all.  This post is long enough, I'll start a new one to elaborate.

Why do I say Rosie Cotton does not fit into the reward trope at all?  Simple -- Luthien and Arwen were won by great deeds.  But Rosie Cotton's love was *delayed* by great deeds.  Sam didn't need to leave the Shire to win her love; he needed to *come back*.

On the road, there's virtually no trace of Rosie-as-inspiration, contrary to Arwen driving Aragorn or Aragorn driving Eowyn.  I believe he thinks of her just once in the text prior to returning home; In Mount Doom when he finally accepts that return is impossible, he thinks "But I would dearly like to see Bywater again, and Rosie Cotton and her brothers, and the Gaffer and Marigold and all".  She gets the honor of the first mention in this sentence, but to this point in the text only the Gaffer has appeared, and it is the Gaffer being turned out that most affects him in the Mirror of Galadriel.  (Rosie is not shown; Ted Sandyman is).

Rosie is part of the stereotypical-domestic-bliss of the Shire, something that Sam wants and longs for, but it is exactly this he risks sacrificing forever by embarking on his journey, and even after his return his concern for Frodo, so damaged by his journey, delays his embrace of the domestic life.  Yes, Sam appreciates the praise Frodo gives him in front of Rosie.  But it was not necessary to win Rosie's love.  There's a reason Farmer Cotton grins when he sends Sam to "check on" Rosie and Mrs. Cotton.  As we learn later from Sam, "It seems she didn't like my going abroad at all, poor lass; but as I hadn't spoken she couldn't say so."  Sam acquires no influence in the Shire because of his great deeds saving Middle Earth, any more than Frodo did.  The respect given to Sam and Merry and Pippin (and Farmer Cotton) was from their role in scouring the shire.

While I've characterized Rosie as part of sterotypical-domestic-bliss, in her bit appearance in LOTR she's hardly deferential and submissive.  Here are the words of Rosie Cotton in the text:

"Hullo, Sam!  Where've you been?  They said you were dead; but I've been expecting you since the Spring.  You haven't hurried, have you?"

"Well be off with you!  If you've been looking after Mr. Frodo all this while, what d'you want to leave him for, as soon as things look dangerous?"

"I think you look fine, Sam.  Go on now!  But take care of yourself, and come straight back as soon as you have settled the ruffians!"

"Well, you've wasted a year, so why wait longer?"

That's a surprising amount of spunk captured in four lines -- if anything, Sam's statement that she "couldn't say so" seems out of place; she doesn't seem very restrained to me.  This is no shrinking violent, no paper caricature of a princess-reward to be given to the conquering hero.  This is a real woman (well, hobbit) with a strong personality.  Given the tiny amount of text space available to develop her personality, seeing her as a sterotype reveals more about the reader than the writer, IMO.

Which brings us to the Rosie Cotton card.  Yes, she has no attack/defense -- she has that in common with Keen-eyed Took, Curious Brandybuck, and Bilbo Baggins ally.  There's no textual reason she *should* have attack/defense.  And yet she's given an ability that's actually *useful* is combat, unlike pipe-fetching Bilbo, who actually *has* combat experience.  For this we're supposed to criticize FFG?  Seeing sexism in providing a *useful* Rosie Cotton card that fits her text instead of providing a warrior-Rosie-Cotton with no relation to the original item says more about the commenter than FFG.  I could see the objection if it were Lobelia, but Rosie?  No way.  She's not a warrior.  She *does* have willpower.

Fine card, worthy of praise, not condemnation.

Just told to actual people what bother me, in his writing and even more in this game. When we use what he have done we should be free to choose what please us and what we don't need. There were never forced to print this Rosie, they choose do it and continue to spread sexism by this way. It is up to you to see if you are ok with that or not. They don't print cards for Tolkien, they print them for us, following OUR need.

*My* need is for Tolkien.  I consider LOTR the greatest literary work in the English language, and one of the things I love about this game is the respect it gives to the lore.  Turning Rosie Cotton into female-hobbit-warrior would show disrespect to the lore.  If FFG wants to make up a female-hobbit-warrior hero and provide a backstory for such an unusual personage, I'm cool with that -- but the saga would NOT be the place to put that imaginary hobbit, and giving us a female hobbit *from the text* instead of a (probably male) Eagle from the text is not "spreading sexism".  The Hobbit faction needs all the help it can get.  (OK, so do the Eagles...)

What I also *don't* need from FFG is for them to look over their shoulder when providing useful abilities for fear that they are displaying an insufficient amount of virtue signaling.

I also object to the idea that "stereotypical women's roles" are somehow inherently inferior to "stereotypical man's roles", although that was certainly Eowyn's view:

"All your words are but to say: you are a woman, and your part is in the house.  But when the men have died in battle and honour, you have leave to be burned in the house, for the men will need it no more.  But I am of the House of Eorl and not a serving-woman.  I can ride and wield blade, and I do not fear either pain or death."

So Rosie, by staying in the Shire and then not grabbing a bow and running off to the battle of bywater, somehow isn't *worthy* of having a card without it giving her imaginary combat skills, while it's just fine for her father to be a hero because he was there?  Rosie's card is dead useful, but that doesn't matter because it's only "willpower", and having willpower makes you have less worth than attack or defense.  (I am speaking of moral worth here -- there's no question in my mind that Rosie is the *top* hobbit ally in utility).  Did you ever consider that perhaps the denigration of traditional women's roles was done because of sexism towards women, not because the role itself was less important, less useful, or less challenging?  Eowyn buys into that narrative and shares the same contempt for the serving-woman.  Faramir does not:

"War must be, while we defend our lives against a destroyer who would devour all; but I do not love the bright sword for its sharpness, nor the arrow for its swiftness, nor the warrior for his glory."

Of course, ally Faramir shares the same "defect" as Rosie Cotton's new card, of exhausting himself to enhance others.  He shares that with hero Dori, with Cirdan or Gandalf exercising Narya, with the event Tale of Tinuviel.  Who knew that ability was unworthy and sexist, at least when done by a female?  It seems proud company to me.

Someone knows if the next deluxe is in showcase there ?? Do you think it is too late for an annoucement ?? And when does the spoilers of the gen-con ??

Nope, there's nothing here about the next deluxe. Probably not going to hear anything about it at this point. 

I'm pretty busy with GenCon right now but I'll try to get a quick summary of the quest up here soon (if nobody beats me to it) as well as a more in-depth summary up on my blog next week. 

In short: it's hard. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

Very good statement dalestephenson! Couldn't have said it better myself. In my personal opinion, I think Willpower is the most important of virtues both in the game and in life. It's much harder to stay good than it is to be strong. Trolls, Balrogs, orcs and Nazgul are all arguably stronger or at least as strong as any of the free people. Strength of arms is not what wins but the Willpower of the good people to stay true and loyal. Besides, all of the moral failings in the book are done by "noble" characters who just happen to be men: Boromir, Denethor, Saruman (arguably a Maia but...), Grima and Lotho. Also, all of the oath breakers were men. I guess to make it fair maybe Eowyn should have abandoned Theoden at Pelennor and helped the Witch-king. Oh well, I can't wait to add Rosie and Tom to some hobbit decks! Thanks

We do indeed. I have the box, but haven't had a chance to play it yet. Do you have any specific questions?

Thanks a lot for confirming this, @Authraw [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/229935-authraw/]! :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] Considering this, I think it is definitely a solid expansion and huge boost to the Hobbit trait.
