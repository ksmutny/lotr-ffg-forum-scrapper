# [Unique Ally Championship?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/184682-unique-ally-championship/)

## 1 [PsychoRocka on August 10, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/184682-unique-ally-championship/?do=findComment&comment=1728606)

Many may remember the hero championship from last year which I'm sure will come around again later this year (https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/127748-the-hero-championship-2014/ [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/127748-the-hero-championship-2014/])

 

Should we have one for all the unique ally cards in the game? I thought this might be fun to do while we wait for Across the Ettenmoors to arrive. Would there be no point because one of the versions of Gandalf would inevitably win? If so, should we do it anyway to see who comes second, third etc?

 

Or is this silly and not worth doing considering how varied unique allies will be in power, cost etc?

I say go for it. It's more or less guaranteed that Gandalf and Faramir will be top of the list but as you said we see the other orders.

Great idea! We've had quite the influx of unique allies recently too, maybe one could pull off the upset over gandalf/faramir. Or maybe it's finally brok ironfist's time to shine!

Faramir is good if you're running purple, but I have honestly cut Gandalf from a lot of my decks.

On the other hand I've splashed blue just for Arwen.

I would really like to see this. I'd be interested to see how far some allies get, especially old favourites, like Henamarth, get against the likes of Saruman and Gandalf :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] Some levity to the forum perhaps  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

It sounds fun but for me Gandalf will be the number one forever :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Yeah, go ahead!

This thread made me thinking and I thought of one thing. Brok Ironfist. To make him viable and bring him back, LOTR LCG needs a Caldara-like Dwarf hero  :lol: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_laugh.png]

I'd like to see the seeding group first by cost, and secondly by sphere, so like-to-like comparisons are possible as long as possible.

in one handed solo there is no better than Hanneman, he can win the game himself, but generally my favourites are Gildor (he is one of my favourite characters anyway) and Gimli leadership ally who has a great ability

 

I have also excluded Ganldalf from my decks for a while, but recently used him again on Fog on The Barrow Downs where he proved very usefull

Yes, there will be a 2015 Hero Championship.

 

Yes, a unique ally competition would be awesome!

 

Just a warning, if you use forum post voting - it's a lot of work to count up everyone's votes. However, I'm still an advocate for this method because it builds friendly rivalry and community (instead of automated hidden ballots where all you see are results).

Cool idea.

 

I'll be voting!

 

My prediction for the finale: Faramir vs Arwen ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

I'm calling it now, Quickbeam is going to be one of the top choices.

## 15 [Ecthelion III on August 11, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/184682-unique-ally-championship/?do=findComment&comment=1730137)

Don't forget Skinbark! I vote that he's even more ridiculously overpowered than Quickbeam, at least in quests with a high percentage of Orcs (most quests out there). On most occasions he can have the equivalent of 5-6 attack!

Oh look at me, already debating on unique allies and there hasn't even been a championship yet. :wacko: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wacko.png]

Legolas might end pretty high as well. The recent unique allies have been pretty **** good, which I really like.

## 17 [PsychoRocka on August 11, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/184682-unique-ally-championship/?do=findComment&comment=1730257)

Alright! Seems there is plenty of interest! I will get it up and running this afternoon!
