I've attached the snare to the warg while it is engaged, then it becomes Day and the Warg returns to the staging area (per the effect on the Time card in The Wastes of Eriador).  At the end of the round the warg is still in the staging area and it becomes night, triggering it's effect.

 

1.  Does it engage the first player, or does it not engage at all since it can't resolve it's effect fully?

2.  If it does engage, is it dealt a shadow card?

 

If anyone has clarification on this please let me know

1) ?

 

2) If it engages, it is dealt a Shadow card.

You would fulfill as much as you can, I think.  Because of this, I believe it would engage you.  There is justification for fulfilling as much as you can because the card We Are Not Idle can still be used if your deck is empty.

 

It would not be dealt a shadow card because it cannot attack.  This means no shadow card is dealt since the only reason you would deal a shadow card in this example is for an attack outside of the combat phase as mentioned in section 1.28 of the FAQ.  Basically, since the attack cannot initiate, no shadow card is dealt.

Pippin and Sam loved this combo when I last played this quest.
