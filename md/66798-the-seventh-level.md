Okay, maybe I'm just a crummy player but am I the only one who found The Seventh Level to be a really tough quest solo? I just went to look at it's difficulty rating and am shocked it's a 3! Haha.

I "breezed" through Into the Pit relatively unscathed and this quest took a lot of doing for me with many, many attempts. My heroes kept getting that darn treachery attachment, the Cave Troll seemed to come up like no other, and just swarms of enemies. I finally realized that this quest is all about getting allies out, and fast, which I was finally able to do this last game when I did finally beat it. I didn't change the number of allies, I simply cut down on a lot of the other attachments in my deck, and that seemed to work.

Just curious to see others opinions! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

it is harder than what its level is, though funnily i found into pit much harder, one of the hardest yet

 This might be the only quest where a tactics heavy deck really shines.

oddly enough, just attempted the final quest of Khazad-Dum for the first time right now, and had no difficulty. The middle quest was the hardest for me! Hahaha.

 I just attempted that quest for the first time today as well, but I wasn't so lucky. I'm sure it was because I was using my 7th Level deck instead of making a new one.

i used the same deck as the 7th level, as well. it's an all dwarf deck; i really think i got lucky with shadow cards and whatnot, though.

This quest can be really hard in solo game. In coop game this quest most of the time easy like hell. But solo yes another story.

This one of my favorite quest cose you never know what can happen(special on the second stage) everything was ok and boom you surrounded gangs of goblins and overwhelmed. One of the rare quest in the game  which is always can surprise you and until the end you never know you win or lose(i mean only for solo game). Love it! Good work of designers. Anyway KD and second cycle is much better then first cycle and looks like hobbit will not dissapointed us too!

I completely agree. The first quest is doable and the last one requires patience and timing but it's also beatable. Seventh Level, however can overwhelm you very quickly with enemies. For me, it was the toughest one, as well.

Oddly, I've never had any trouble with Seventh level, but I always play 2 player so that's probly got a lot to do with it.preocupado.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/preocupado.gif]
