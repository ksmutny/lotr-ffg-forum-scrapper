 New preview online.

I think she is awesome for cost 2.

1 DEF, 2 WP, and 2 HP are great let alone how useful her ability can be.

The new event sounds fantastic as well if you can get the situation up and running.  It's 0 cost for crying out loud!  Hooray!

Nice, I guess this means the watcher will be available in 2 weeks.

Arwen sounds awesome to boost Dain with sentinel if you are playing with a companion Dwarf deck.  Dain with sentinel +4 defense, and 5 hit points (or +6 with the Boots on) is pretty much a wall.

 Wow... usually it's a tough call on taking something out of the deck, but for Arwen I think I'd take out just about anything... beautiful artwork, awesome ability, 2 health to keep treacheries from killing her right off, and 2 willpower... simply amazing. happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]

lol Compared to the Dwarrowdelf Spirit allies (Bofur, Zigil Miner, Arwen, Rider of the Mark) all Leadership allies in the game look like crap...

 Yeah, it'd be nice if they released another non-gimmicky (Dunedain Wanderer costs 5, in solo games he uses none of his special abilities) leadership ally. I think Arwen fits into spirit best though. I still can't get over how good she is though. Her only downside is she can't be used in two scenarios!

Well, there are two more articles coming, so at least two more weeks. My current prediction is April 18th we'll see the announcement that Watcher is On Sale. That week's good luck for me, my birthday is April 20th and it's also the day the card game was released last year!

And now I'm super excited for this release! Arwen is AMAZING! and it looks like we'll finally get some elf cards! I couldn't be happier!

 Arwen is great, and Magali as always amaze me.

In Spain we have April 27th as release date for Watcher in the Water.

Greatings.

I'd thought Arwen would be a Hero, something comparable to Eowyn.. but I can't complain for cost 2 lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif]

Beautiful artwork, nice ability, I'm not complaining. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] I like her.

Come on guys, I will be the first to say it; she is hot! Even better though, her stats are insanely good.

Does anyone think that FFG might create alternatives Ally's in as Heroes and current Heroes as Ally's?  They would not be able to be played as both in the same deck/game state, but I can imagine Hero and Ally versions of the same title.

## 15 [laiyna on March 28, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62349-arwen-will-be-an-ally/?do=findComment&comment=611022)

I'm actually very disappointed.

 

Was more then only hoping she would be a Hero, I actually expected it. Real disappointment.

Mr French have confirmed this to be happening. We will see alternate version of characters. I do not find it neccessary as of yet since there are just so many options, not only for unique characters but we can be getting indefinite number of non-unique allies still as the game has not yet scratched the surface of the universe, and of course other limit-less card posibilities.

The exception is Glorfindel. He is supposed to arrive again and I am all for that since the first one just is not the card it should be. Glorfindel was one of the most mighty of his time, the card does not represent it at all. But it makes sense to get his second copy as there actually were "two Glorfindels" in the history and only later confirmed by Tolkien they were the same guy returning from Mandos after his death.

Glorfindel is really good. Just need to understand how to play him. He is one of the best hero in the game now.Only thanks to him you can build up the deck which is win against  all quests.

ive seen you state that before but i still dont understand how he is

I am disappointed in Arwen being an ally for the same reason I was disappointed that Faramir was an ally: I would like family members to get the same treatment. It would be awesome to run the 3 children of Elrond together as the heroes of a deck.

It would be nice to see a Noldor spirit hero, especially since we don't have any Elvish spirit heroes, which I find rather odd. I agree with Rich on Glorfindel. He has a nice base willpower and attack, but at a threat cost of 12 and a pretty lousy ability, I stay away from him. With Dain, you can get heroes with better stats and abilities, and lower starting threat. Maybe someday we can see some synergies, but right now, compared to the others in our hero pool, I just don't find him that useful.
