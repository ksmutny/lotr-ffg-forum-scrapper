 I have never really used longboard map maker.  (my kids actually make fun of this card.). But I was rereading his text.  Am I to understand I can spend as many tokens as I have and want with each one giving him +1 to the quest?  Also, they do NOT have to be lore since it does it specify, or do they have to be lore?

He is one of the most powerful quest cards in the game, and should be in any quest deck... each resource you spend adds +1, this is "pumpable" so you can spend as many resources as you like to pump this ability. He is crazy good. The resources that are spend need to come fro ma hero with a lore icon, so song of wisdom (or w/e the lore adding icon song is called) will aid you in this.

 I am obviously blind!  I was reading it from the lotrlcg.com site and didn't notice the lore icon on the card because I was reading it from the wording next to the card on the site which left out the icon.  Thanks!

no problem, you know ive never really payed him as much attention as he deserves apart from admiring the art- he's going in my next lore/sprit deck, him and escort to edoras will be a beast

 So, booored, can I have him in as my ally and a game partner spend his/her lore icons too?

no, card effects must be paid by the card owner, also cards are "taken control of" when you play them on other players, like say attachments for example.

He is very powerful card. I use him im my lore/spirit/leadership deck. With his ability you can always control how much will power you need not less not more. Very useful.
