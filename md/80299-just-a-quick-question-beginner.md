What does it means that you mean that an attachment exhausts? For example Steward of gondor, it says, attached hero gains the gondor trait, exhaust steward of gondor to add 2 resources to attached hero's pool. What does it mean? Another example could be great yew bow.

 

Thanks

It means that if you exhaust steward of gondor (turn the card) it gives 2 resources tokens to the hero it is attached…

it means that you place it 90 degrees on its side, just like when you exhaust a hero. once exhausted, it cannot be re-exhausted without being readied (again just like a hero) note however that heros and attatchments exhaust seperately, so exhausting steward of gondor doesnt exhaust the character it is attatched to

It means exactly what it says, you can exhaust attachments just like you do with heroes and allies. It's just a way to prevent you from using that card effect more than once a round.

Of course during the refresh phase your attachments will ready, just like all your other cards do.

So if for example I'm using steward of gondor, I exhaust it, I gain 2 resources to that hero, and when the refresh phase begins I ready steward to gain 2 more resources and so on?

Yes, once readied you can exhaust it again.

Just to be precise you don't get another 2 when readied, just when you exhaust it.

Wow, one of the best cards in the game, isn't it? You get 3 resources instead of 1 every phase.

Indeed, it's nearly mandatory if you have a leadership hero in your deck, especially if you plan on having lots of expensive allies.

At first, I also thought the hero that had the card attached needed to exhaust as well, because Steward of Gonder just seemed too good. :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]
