And I can't pick them up till this weekend even though they're sitting at my FLGS right now.

Hope to be active on here. I was pretty involved with Warhammer: Invasion, but that game burned me out after the first two cycles -- metagame was just too broken. I really hope this game doesn't do the same.

Looks like I might have to get a third core based on initial card numbers... that really sucks.

Cheers!

 

(Looking forward to foruming again with players like Toqtamish and WyteFang!)

Good to see you again Fiendish Devil. I too got burned out on Warhammer, still doing AGoT some.

Yep. I play AGoT now and again. But I just join in when players at my FLGS. I cba to continue buying when I don't have time to play it that much. This game looks good because the solo play has great appeal for me.

You should check out the HBO AGoT show. It's pretty good.

Watched it 3 times already. Twice back to back last night. I still buy AGoT but haven't played much but the show makes me wanna play again. So that and LotR will be the two LCG's I collect and play. Can't wait to get my core set so I can actually play this game. Even if it is just solo at first to learn it so I can teach the wife and friends.

Three times! haha. I watched it only once so far, like three weeks ago when my office early screened it. I have the first ep saved, will probably go through it again tonight and pick up the juicy details I most likely missed first time around when I was so enthralled at getting to see it early! sorpresa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sorpresa.gif]
