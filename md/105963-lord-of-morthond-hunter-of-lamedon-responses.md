If I have Lord of Morthond attached and I put Hunter of Lamedon in play, do I draw for Lord of Morthond first or do I use Hunter of Lamedon's response first?  I played it that I could choose the order, is that right?  I drew for Hunter, discarded the card as it was not Outlands, and drew again for Lord of Morthond because Hunter was Lore.

You can choose the order of responses.
