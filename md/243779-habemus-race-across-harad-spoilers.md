A player in the LOTR LCG FB group has posted this month's player cards spoilers (some of which I am extemely excited about). So, without further adue, here are the as of yet unspoiled cards:

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What can I even say. The words Orthanc, Isengard and Doomed in the same card again. I wanted this for so long.

yeah, and given the other Harad mechanics, he seems really good for the trait

The power of Orthanc cannot be lightly thrown aside indeed... Hoping Caleb learned his lesson from the Ring-maker cycle lol! As for the card, I absolutely love it. Sure, it costs 3 and asks for doomed to draw cards, but with reduction and/or Loragorn the doomed is just gravy. Drawing cards is always really good, especially if you can splash it into whatever event you play, and I'm so glad they gave the doomed themed ally 2 willpower.

Steward of Orthanc seems pretty sick.  Card draw in neutral sphere is a  big deal.   And his stats are fairly respectable as well.

Sooooooo if you don't want to use his Response because you for example play multiplayer.... Is he worth 3 resources for 2 willpower? I would say no but wouldn't be surprised if people think different about that.

Not getting why Backtrack costs 1 resource, you already investing the card slot in your deck, card from your hand to merely juggle the resources you already possess. And you need to have those resources in the first place (quest progress equal to or greater to the location quest points). 

 

Kahliel's Tribesman seems awesome. 

 

Proud Hunters gonna be awesome.

 

Eryn Galen Settler is another proof of the power creep among allies.

 

Steward of Orthanc gonna be huge.

Yeah but power creep among encounter cards is keeping pace too =) What, you don't wanna get rid of 2 Gates of Annuminas as one action?

I meant stats. 1/2/0/2 for a 2 cost Lore ally is unheard of. As well as not long ago spoiled 2/2/0/2 spirit ally at the cost of 3 with a free quest ability.

3 *neutral* resources, which can be a huge deal.

probably not.  I don't think I'd run him if I seriously never planned to use his Response.  If his trait was something more useful than Isengard perhaps,  but it's not, so..    Maybe if you're desperate for willpower?  Maybe?

If you're looking for willpower in a mono-tactics deck, 3 resources for 2 willpower is a great deal.  Non-unique is gravy.

Backtrack is a killer sideboard card.

I also like that it isn't confined to a particular phase, so you could use it in planning in conjunction with Ancient Mathom or Ranger Provisions or Elf-stone.

if you're playing mono tactics than willpower is somebody else's job in multiplayer.   Or were you just saying that generally and not in response to Crabble?  If so,  yeah, I'd definitely run him, because Tactics could use some more card draw as well.  

## 17 [dalestephenson on March 1, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/243779-habemus-race-across-harad-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=2662010)

For solo mono-tactics it's a great deal without the card draw, and the card draw is also desperately needed.

In multiplayer I wouldn't expect mono-tactics generally to give deck space for a 3-cost 2-wp ally, even if resource-rich (Mablung), but there can be exceptions.  One of my Dori-fellowships has a supporting hobbit deck meant to churn out the attachments for the mono-tactics deck:

http://ringsdb.com/fellowship/view/112/dori-eagles-and-hobbits [http://ringsdb.com/fellowship/view/112/dori-eagles-and-hobbits]

In this case, the tactics deck is the questing *and* fighting deck, the hobbit deck has very few allies.  The Warden would fit great in the tactics deck to provide cheap additional willpower and card draw, and the hobbits can absorb the extra doom cost easily thanks to SpMerry and a low starting threat.

In multiplayer I wouldn't expect Tactics to have the need to quest.

Is Steward of Orthanc the best card we've seen this cycle?

Galadriel/Hama with Keys of Orthanc: Recoup the cost of feint with the Keys, recoup Hama's discard with the Steward, recoup the cost of doomed with Galadriel. You can feint every turn for free.

Not denying that there is some ally power creep, but I'm glad Eryn Galen Settler has the price/stats he does. Allies that discard themselves should not be too expensive, and at the same time they should have decent stats to that you are actually losing something substantial by triggering the ability, making it more of a decision.

Yeah, I don't think the Settler's stats are out of line.  He's still far worse than Quickbeam, and if you are in secrecy the Ithilien Lookout is very similar but cheaper.  He seems like he will be functional in the right deck, but probably not worthwhile in most decks.  That's the perfect level of balance, imo.

Quickbeam is unique.

I am not saying it is a bad thing, quite the contrary - I think it took them too long to start adjusting the stats apropriately (check out the Mirkwood Pioneer). Inflated stats is exactly the way self-discarding allies should be approached, and I was advocating this way of their design for a pretty long time (you may notice that in my reworks of old cards), but unfortunately, numerous previous instances of such allies had atrocious stat boxes.

The Tribesman is awesome since you can tweak your Willpower after encounter cards are revealed in the quest phase, or boost Jubayr's defense after shadow cards are revealed. Or you can boost Yazan's ranged attack if he needs a little extra firepower. He's just really versatile. Or he can just be fuel for Kahliel's discard ability, which we need more cards for.

Ah, yes, that's what I was missing. After the fact questing/defense boosts and the ability to participate in ranged/sentinel. That's pretty cool!

Like Donkler said, the timing flexibility is a big part of it.  You can wait until after staging to see if you need (or don't want) the extra willpower.  You can wait until after the shadow card is revealed to see if you need an extra defense (kind of like Honour Guard).  The action becomes stronger if you are able to ready and take advantage of the buff multiple times (via Kahliel's readying ability, for example).

Not to mention the guy isn't unique so you can put multiple copies on the table. Two of them in play, plus Kahliel with a Harad in hand to discard, which btw wouldn't be hard to pull at all, and you can easily boost WP/ATK/DEF by 3. I also want to add that, in this game, it is possible to quest and attack with several characters at the same time, but for defending you can do it only with just 1 defender at a time. This new Harad ally is the equivalent to defending with several characters at the same time. I don't know you guys but I find this particular quality to be awesome. Until now we had to rely on attachments and events to boost defense, now we can do it with allies as well

The stat boost from the Tribesman lasts until the end of the phase, and Kahliel's ability allows you to ready Harad allies. Even if you only have one copy of the Tribesman, you can easily benefit from the boost in multiple aspects of the game. The Tribesman is even useful late-game, because you can just discard an extra copy to trigger Kahliel's ability. This archetype has only existed for a month now and is already quite flexible. Impressive.

Can I use The Seeing Stone to get a Steward of Orthanc from my deck (or a Guard of Henneth Annun, Mirkwood Pioneer, etc.) ?

The Doomed keyword is printed in the text of the card but not as a keyword applicable for the card itself but to be granted to an Event card. 

I don't know if a keyword needs to be  an 'active' keyword with a direct effect when the card is played or in play to be considered as such, or if it's sufficient that it be printed on the card?

Nope, and that's why I hope Caleb gives the Doomed/Isengard/Palantir theme a bit more support so The Seeing-Stone becomes more relevant. And yeah I know technically it doesn't have to be Isengard and Palantir themed. He could just print any random event or ally and give him Doomed and it would help The Seeing Stone (as he did in the Ring-Maker cycle), but I really hope more Doomed cards deal with the themes of Isengard and the dangers of corruption, like this Steward did. It really is to me the direction in which the Doomed keyword should go, theme-wise.

While we're on the topic of allies which discard for effect, I wish that the Eryn Galen Settler had been a Rohan ally instead. Gamling makes that whole archetype much more viable. The Settler's ability is fairly conditional, so if I'm going to play 2 resources it would be nice to (have the option) to get the ally back. In any case, Woodman still has zero trait synergy, so I will be adding this ally to the growing list of sideboard fodder.

There's only one Tactics card spoiled here, and no Tactics cards were spoiled in the announcement for this pack. I'm guessing that's because Mighty Warrior is in this pack (which wasn't clear, since it was spoiled in a card fan for The Mûmakil).

Some first impressions:

I love the art and flavour of Backtrack, even though I'm not sure how often it will see play.

The art on the tribesman looks like it could be art for an enemy card, since very few characters look fierce and furious like this one. Possible exceptions include Erebor Battle Master and Azain Silverbeard. Some characters, such as Tactics Théoden, Alt-art Aragorn, and ally Damrod, look fierce and determined, but not furious. The art does fit the flavour text, though.

Resource generation in Tactics is worthwhile. If you want to run Proud Hunters in a mono-Tactics deck, there are 8 Tactics heroes (Gimli, Legolas, Elladan, Boromir, Prince Imrahil, Théoden, Éomer, and Éowyn) and no unique allies with the Noble Trait, and 3 Tactics heroes (Elladan, Mablung, and Aragorn) and 1 unique ally (Yazan) with the Ranger trait.

In terms of power creep, Eryn Galen Settler is the first 2-cost non-unique ally (without a drawback) whose willpower plus attack equals 3. (Wandering Ent enters play exhausted, and Lindon Navigator forces you to discard.) Defense usually only matters on allies if the ally has relatively high defense and hit points, and Defender of Rammas is the only (non-Ent) 2-cost ally that's good as a repeated defender. Willpower and attack, however, are always useful. Even among unique 2 cost allies, the Settler's stats are only clearly inferior to Quickbeam, and roughly equal to Ceorl, Mablung, and Ghân-buri-Ghân. I don't necessarily see this as a problem, since it makes the decision about whether to use his ability more interesting. I imagine that the Settler will see play in a decent number of Lore decks for raw stat efficiency, and a sometimes-useful ability. As the designers develop the Woodman trait, it's interesting that all the Woodman allies so far have abilities that can interact with locations.

The art on Steward of Orthanc is reminiscent of the art on another steward, ally Denethor. Aside from the worthwhile ability, 2 willpower in neutral can be played round 1 in trisphere decks. It reinforces the sense that most Istari-related cards are neutral.

I don't think The Seeing-stone allows you to search your deck for a card that can gain the doomed keyword, since (for example) Mirkwood Pioneer doesn't have the doomed keyword itself, although it can gain it.

Yeah, I am aware of that, i was talking more about the doomed keyword hereon forward and how it was a bit too random theme-wise in the Ring-maker cycle IMO (but my post still applies to Close Call and Waters of Nimrodel)

I would expect Woodman to be developed in the next cycle. That seems common to spoil upcoming Traits. Mirkwood gave us Dain, Blood of Gondor gave us Children of the Sea...

Put Mighty Warrior on Sam, add Captain of Gondor, Rainment of War, a Hobbit Cloak and Fast Hitch.  Optionally engage an enemy lower than your threat, ready, defend for 6, then attack for 5.

Put Mighty Warrior on Gloin and add Vigilant Guard.  Should pay for itself quickly.

Put Mighty Warrior and Rainment of War on Vigilant Dunadan.  That makes him a 4 attack, 3 defense, 5 hp ally who doesn't exhaust to defend with a side quest in the victory display.  Get Arwen ally out to bump him to 4 defense with sentinel.

Pity Tides of Fate would only boost his defense by three "for that attack".  It'd be awesome to have a 7 defense ally who doesn't exhaust to defend.

Song of Mocking is certainly the easier solution, but if you are bringing Gloin with the goal of soaking up a bunch or treachery and spread damage, it's not so helpful.

It's also noteworthy that Vigilant Guard gives 2 additional hit points without using up a restricted slot, which can be valuable to Gloin in its own right.

Song of Mocking is *way* cheaper/easier to set up than Mighty Warrior + Vigilant Guard.  However, Song of Mocking only lets you deflect damage from a single hero, while Vigilant Guard can cannibalize one point of damage from any character, anywhere, any number of times.  Getting +2 hp is also helpful.

I don't see the issue with Tribesman's art.  His arm is behind and above him.

i really hope this excessive delay is because they found a problem on one of the cards and had to get it reprinted.  (Settler)  Otherwise this delay makes little sense.  The chapter packs are usually pretty regularly spaced at one month.

His neck is obscured by the cloak he's wearing. His right shoulder is also under the cloak and additionally, due to the angle, is partly obscured by his chin. I've no idea what you mean about the third one, his head is clearly narrower than his chest is.

I mean, I'm not amazed by the art, but I don't think it's that bad.

Now 0/3 with my tier 2 Three Hunters deck.  It's no pushover for sure.

There are two quest decks, one for you and one for the orcs.  Only one encounter deck.  You really want to stay ahead of the orcs if you can which means lots of questing.  There are also certain times when you have to reveal an extra encounter card - not one per player - which obviously stresses the solo player more.  Really nice quest.  My only complaint is that there are a lot of rules on the different cards that interact and their effects are constantly changing depending on which stages the players or orcs are on.  Not an easy quest to play or win.

Yep, I concur with Bullroarer. This is a really tough quest, especially on 4-player. The fact that you cannot place more than 10 progress on the quest each round really keeps up the tension and makes the game feel like a race, no matter how good your deck is.

You can't win this quest the traditional way - that is, with good questing and enemy control. Those are still essential, but they're not quite enough to put you over the top. At the moment, I'm inclined to say that winning this quest requires quite a bit of luck, at least on 4 player. It's really unusual (at least, in the 2 games I've played so far) to see the Orcs put less than 10 progress on their stage each round.

You might think that Radagast's Cunning would be the key to winning this quest, but that effect only lasts "until the end of the [quest] phase", whereas the orcs place progress "at the end of the quest phase". Same goes for Secret Paths.

The best trick I can think of is to use encounter deck manipulation (Lore Denethor, Risk Some Light) to ensure that the Orcs don't place a few extra progress each round.

We barely edged it out Monday with three players: Caldara.deck, Three Hunters, and The Deck You Want Your Friend To Play. The third to last turn was the make-or-break turn, when the Orcs finally caught up to us. A mad scramble to find enough non-lethal defenses while all suffering from dehydration.

Finally beat it 4-player. I used victory display manipulation with a 2-hero deck consisting of Spirit Merry and Lore Denethor. I decided that Harad Road was the encounter card that was most dangerous in a 4-player game, and used a first-turn Out of the Wild to remove one from the deck, and a turn-two Leave No Trace to remove the second one. Removed an Uruk Pursuer with None Returned, and avoided a second Uruk Pursuer with The Door is Closed! The Orcs only had 5 progress on stage 4D when we cleared River Harnen.

Overall, I'd say this support deck greatly enhanced our chances of success. Denethor frequently checked the encounter deck after questing but before the end of the quest phase (to try and minimize the amount of extra progress the Orcs made).

The other three decks were a Celeborn/Galadriel/Elrond Silvan deck, a Faramir/Bifur/Mablung Ent deck, and a Gloin/Erestor/Erkenbrand defense deck.

Wow what a quest.  This one ticks all the boxes.  Congratulations to the designer(s) and playtesters.  I think it's the hardest of the extended cycle so far, but I recognize that this one is extra hard for solo players.  If I am to nickpick - and it really is a nit pick - the quest is a bit too "fussy".  There are sooo many cards interacting with other cards.  Really hard to keep track of everything.  But I am starting to believe that is the price of progress and we will need to learn to live with it on harder quests.

Awesome quest. The design is really well done, in that there are many catch-up mechanics built in that prevent either you or the orcs from advancing too far ahead so that it seems like every time you win it will still be a close call.

It does require a certain kind of deck though. Ethir Swordsmen saved the day for me.

On my first attempt I chose to have the Uruk Warg-rider in my staging area, and held my Tamed Mumak back to attack and kill him on the first round. Naturally the Warg-rider had the shadow card that moved him to the Orc's staging area. It was a good introduction to how this quest was going to thrash me.

I have a question here ...

IF I play a player side quest, and I chose it to be the quest for the turn, then I am not considered to be on same stage with orcs even if the quest on an encounter and orc stage are the same number?

Also, if I manage to destory Uruk chieftain while we are on the same stage number, the Force effec on orc quest card to return him in orc area is not taken in consideration, correct?

Anyway, won this on 3rd attempt with Loragorn, Lead Gimli and Spirit Legolas ... on the first two attempts I was playing wrong against me placing any enemy discarded by the force effect on Orc stage at the Orce Staging area , thus when I should engage there where many enemies ... then I realized that they should be discarded 

Ally Firyal helps VERY much on solo, try him. Aso Steward of Orthanc on the most crucial moment helped me draw Blood of Numenor and turn Loragorn in to a power defender when I had no other damage to spare ... great ally too

The Orc Stage Quest have that at the end of Quest phase, player discard a card from the encounter deck and add that cards threat to the threat of any orc on the Orc Stage to place progress

In my first two games, whenever the so discarded card was an enemy, I was adding it to the Orc stage additionally to adding its threat, instead of discarding it after adding the threat.

Thus I found my self having 4 enemies in Orc Stage in bith these games and at some point they were all engaging me

Ah... Got it.  I didn't make that mistake, but it would have made the quest impossible!

At the risk of asking a rules question here, there are two warg enemies that attach to existing orcs as a mount when revealed.  Both say limit one, but they don't say limit one "mount".  Is it possible for an orc to have both kinds of wargs as mounts simultaneously?  I don't think that was the intent, but as I read the cards it can happen.

From the text I'd say you have no other choice as to attach them, as both read: "attach this card to an orc enemy, only 1 per enemy." As they are different cards they shouldn't interfere with each other.

Try imagine the orc riding one warg and having the other as a kind of "hunting dog".

The wargs being called mount attachments makes sense and has the "upside" that they can not be discarded by something like miner of the iron hill and fits perfectly to someone riding two armored destriers.

I can't figure out if I've been playing this wrong or not...

Quest card 1D - "Uruk Chieftain cannot leave the orcs area."

Uruk Chieftain - "Forced: At the end of the encounter phase, Uruk Chieftain engages the player engaged with the most non-unique Orc enemies."

Which takes precedent?  (I've been having the chieftain come down, but now I'm not sure.)

My bet is that Uruk Chieftain can engage you and stay in the orcs area at the same time. Should be like in Shadow in Flame where the Balrog can attack you and remain in the staging area at the same time.

I am not even sure why 1D says that the Chiefain can't leave the orc area, as we advance to stage 2B immediately and aren't in stage 1 together with the orcs at any time and ANY enemy can't leave the orc area as long as we are in another stage. Guess it is just a reminder.

As soon as the orcs get to stage 2 the chieftain can leave (but can't take damage) and returns to the orc area to make progress at the end of each quest phase.

So all in all I would say as long as you are ahead, the chieftain does NOT engage/attack you. I am sure if you would need to fight him, they would have worded it like "considered..." to make it crystal clear he still is in the orc area, but also engaged.

 

Some other thoughts why he should only fight you why you are in the same stage: 
1. If not, the quest would be pretty brutal. You have a location and have to put the rider somewhere and deal with it's threat/the extra progress from the orcs AND defend against a five attack enemy every round without beeing able to kill him.

2. Story-wise the different stages show if you are ahead of the orcs or not. As long as they didn't catch up (same stage) it makes no sense for the chieftain to being able to attack you (he's just "too far away"). Once he catches up things change until you manage to escape again.

Conspiracy time: the dream-chaser to harad releases were rushed because the licenses had to be renewed and if for some reason they couldn't, they had to release everything before the end of the year. 

Now the license has been renewed and Mountain of fire got a MEC 7 spots ahead and they are not in a hurry anymore.
