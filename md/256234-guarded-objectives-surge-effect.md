Hi,

One quick question, can a guarded objective have more than 1 guard attached?, for example when the first guard card (an enemy) has a surge effect and thisÂ second card is another enemy.

Regards,

No, the second enemy would be added to the staging area in the normal fashion.

In fact even if the first card is a surge treachery the guarded objective will be freen the surge card only go to the staging area.
