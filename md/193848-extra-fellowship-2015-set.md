I have an extra because my wife played also so we got 2 and really only need one. I am looking for either an alt-art Gimli or an AGOT 2.0 "A Game Of Thrones" promo which I believe was given out at Gencon and some more at Worlds. Is anyone up for a trade? :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] Alternatively I guess I could sell it and buy said AGOT promo but would be easier to do a straight trade!Â
