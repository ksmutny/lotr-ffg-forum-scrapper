I was expecting that article on heroes this week but looks like we might be waiting till next week.

Yes I was too. And the Support page has a tease about rules being posted.

It would have been nice, but I was not expecting two weeks in a row.  Personally, I'd like to see a cool event or two.  "Verb" cards always got me going. 

## 4 [Toqtamish on September 3, 2010](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/34964-no-update-this-week/?do=findComment&comment=352800)

However, they did say in last weeks article, check back next week. So yes I was expecting this week too.

This was rather disappointing! I cannot remember that FFG has misinformed their customers in this way before. Hence I am very sure that they must a good reason to postpone the announced game teaser.

FFG employees take a ton of time off after GenCon (I think there is a freeze on vacations for the 30-90 days before for obvious reasons), and it hasn't even been a month since the end of GenCon yet. 

I think they are probably suffering from the same issues we all are after taking time off and coming off their GenCon high.

That being said, we are checking daily FFG!!!  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Its the only way I get through the work day - check at 11:00 a.m. in the morning and 3:30 p.m. in the afternoon.  Without the fix, I'm not sure how I'd survive.

Maybe they should change their verbage when they mention when the next update should arrive.

They probably shouldn't say "Next week we will look at..."

This is to soften the blow for people like myself who are hanging on every article for especially this game.

I know things change and all...and I want this to be a **** good game, so really take your time FFG.

With Mountains of Madness being announced that means they have at least three new games in development. I'm not sure of the size of the company but this would seem a substantial workload along with new expansions etc.

Yea, I kinda wonder with Kevin working on Civilization if Descent will suffer.  Also with Corey working on so many games, an expansion for Middle-Earth Quest is looking pretty distant as well.

I almost would like less games to come out and more updates and previews for the 'other' games that were previewed prior to all of these releases.

I'm just upset because of non updates for Lord of the Rings LCG.

Don't get me wrong,  I like the fact of all of these games coming out. But I would just like more updates and previews please!!!

I hope they are not putting LOTR LCG on the backburner to get these other games out because of development. or other issues.

Well the fact that they were demoing it at GenCon should mean that it's not on the backburner - I'm guessing that the hold up is something to do with either art and/or rules.

It could simply be that they're trying to make sure they have enough copies in the first batch to go around given the very high interest this game is receiving.

I'm sure it is just because they are crazy busy with all the zillions of games announced.

But if it was a huge change I would love it if they decided to make it more like Dominion or Thunderstone rather than monthly packs etc.  Just full-playsets each and every release.  Large box expansions that can be combined or played alone.

Won't happen though.  They are simply busy.

What do you say FFG...just tell it like it is.

At this point, I don't need any updates on how the game is played. I just need to know that this game is

still on the horizon and not running into development, copyright, or any other reason that will disable this game to come out on the market

this Fall/Winter.

 

Just a "Still on board with the game...it's definitely coming along fine".

It was at the AGoT/CoC/WHI LCG event at Burg Stahleck / Bacharach. I did take a quick look at the rules and cards I didn't actually play it, because my schedule was full with other games. I think it was the same custom-printed cards as at Gencon. So no finished product. Some guys tried it, but I didn't speak with them afterwards, so no idea how good/bad the game is.

Very frustrated. From the 2 major gaming companies that I buy products from prodominently (FFG and Wizards of the Coast D&D), there has been a real issue with communication with their customers. WOTC has been horrible recently with Insider and in particular updates with this game.

Ultimately in the grand scheme of life this stuff really doesn't matter but when you put money into a service (I know this is a luxury in life), I get bummed when I don't see feedback or responses to customer questions. In the instance of this LOTR card game, a simple "sorry for the non-updates in months when it stated "Next week"...would be quite appreciated. Simple stuff goes a long way with me at least. 

Just blowing off steam. 

## 63 [Rathmaker on November 3, 2010](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/34964-no-update-this-week/?do=findComment&comment=381793)

I must say that when I first heard of this game I was geniunely excited to try it out.  I used to check this site for information every couple of days.  As time went on I began to check just once a week.

Now, with no updates in over 2 months, I believe I am checking this site for the last time.  I just have no interest in a game that seems like it is not getting any marketing/attention from the designers at all.  Does the lack of information reflect a neglect on the game designers part, and suggest this is going to just be a LOTR title to add to the others?

I do not care to get involved with another company that seems to not give attention to a game I was looking forward to supporting whole heartily.  I experienced that with the last LOTR card game (from Decipher) in the end....

date - right now it's 'In Development' when it gets to at the
printers, or On the Boat we'll better be able to pin things down.

Thanks for your patience,

So not much new but I appreciate the prompt response and good intentions.

I feel like we're all just very excited about this and so it's making us a little impatient. In the grand scheme of things this game is still a couple months from coming out so there's still plenty of time for a build up. Think of what a luxury it is to have any communication at all from a company! Monopoly didn't have any product previews when it came out! Don't give up hope fellows!

According to the spanish site of Edge Entertainment the release-date is April 2011 .....

... this game is still a couple months from coming out ...

Sorry, but if this game is still listed as "under development," then it's going to be much, much longer than two or three months before it's in the hands of consumers. Hell, the slow boat from China takes about a month all on its own, and LotR is still light-years from that stage.

No, the reality is looking like this: the initial publicity splash for this game was ill-timed and way too early. Something went wrong at some point, either with the gameplay, the production schedule, the available personnel to work on it, or whatever. The reasons probably don't really matter in the long run; all that's relevant is that LotR has been pushed to the back of the queue.

My new prediction is GenCon of 2011 (or August of 2011 for those not familiar with GenCon). If it appears before then (for instance, if the "April of next year" rumors turn out to be correct), I'll be pleasantly surprised.

I am with you guys. I am excited about this game. But, the wind is being let out of the sails at a pretty steady pace. I think it is great that FFG releases information, but, its like they release to much before it is really ready.

 

Must be some sort of competition thing.

I'd guess it is more of a forum thing. They probably thought they were further along in the development process than they really were at Gencon, and when you have something to say about a game, how can you pass up on the Gencon opportunity. I'd guess Gencon was too early to talk about the game, not that the current silence is too late - from a game development point of view, anyway.

new update now available!

## 73 [guest530780 on November 17, 2010](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/34964-no-update-this-week/?do=findComment&comment=386566)

Note that the news items says we will "experience the core set later this winter." So at least February, more than likely, but before March 21.

## 74 [Narsil0420 on November 17, 2010](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/34964-no-update-this-week/?do=findComment&comment=386578)

Yeah judging by previous LCG preview schedules, we're probably only 2-3 months from release! Also the description page has been updated with new card pictures! There's a freaky looking wraith Treachery card! Sweet!

## 75 [Wallenstein on November 18, 2010](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/34964-no-update-this-week/?do=findComment&comment=386724)

Graphics are really outstanding.

New character - male or female? I think that beginning of it's name is "Lego..."  sorpresa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sorpresa.gif]

He/she is NOBLE, Ranged, and stats like Legolas from previous sneek peek.

 

## 76 [Dasor on November 18, 2010](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/34964-no-update-this-week/?do=findComment&comment=386885)

Beorn's Path graphic is AWESOME!!!

I think this might actually be Legolas and they just changed his artwork! (He doesn't have to be blonde you know!)

## 78 [Wallenstein on November 19, 2010](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/34964-no-update-this-week/?do=findComment&comment=387182)

Yes, Sindar use to have dark hair.

Funny that on almost every picture Legolas have blonde hairs - I don't remember if in a book we have clear information on that.

I'm telling you guys, it's Ayn Rand. She will strike down the minions of the Dark Lord and all tyranny with the power of capitalism!

A friend of mine sent an e-mail to FFG and they answered him that the game will be translated also in italian and it should be ready for this christmas.

I hope that this is true! ^^

Not a chance.

FFG plans to release the translated versions of the game simultaneously with the original and the German translation is expected in February/March 2011.

Ah, alright, so apparently now everyone is on the same information level - that's a good thing!

I am cool with the game hitting later (Feb-April) as that will give me time to save up.  Especially if I need to get 3x core sets to match up with the triplicate cards in all the expansions.

Of course, I'd be cool with it hitting now as well!  lol

Christmas of 2011 should be no problem at all.
