# [Peril and Hide questions for multiplayer](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/91248-peril-and-hide-questions-for-multiplayer/)

Both the new "Peril" and "Hide" keywords incicate that when a player reveals the card with those keywords on them, the player who revealed the card must do such and such.  So when playing multiplayer (2 player), can Player 1 reveal both cards from the encounter deck or must it be that the first player reveals the first encounter deck card and Player 2 must reveal the second encournter deck card?  (And if so, who is responsible for the third card that is revelaed after a "surge" effect?)  I would rather have the player with the Hobbit deck always reveal the cards since he can handle the hide tests better than the other player's deck, but I can't find any ruling that demands how this ought to be handled.

 

Any help?

See the section "New Staging Rules" in the rulebook for The Black Riders. It particular it states 

".. players reveal encounter cards individually in player order during the staging step of the Quest phase."

 

So, every player needs to be able to hide and/or handle peril as necessary.

Thanks!

 

So what happens if in a 2-player game the second person draws a card with surge?  Does that mean the first player draws that card and is responsible for it (and then if that particular card has yet another surge, is it drawn by the second player?)

In a standard game, you reveal one card per player during the staging step.  The original manual just says "the encounter deck reveals one card per player."

 

In BR, each player reveals their own card in turn, starting with the first player.  The "Peril" keyword is on some cards.  When Peril comes up, no other player can play cards to help the player who revealed that card (so no other player can use A Test of Will, for example, or Sneak Attack and Gandalf to save the day).  You're on your own.

 

When Surge comes up, the player who revealed that card also reveals the next card (so you're still on your own if Peril pops up on the surged card).
