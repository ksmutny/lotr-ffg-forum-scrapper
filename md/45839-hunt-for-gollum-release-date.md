I know I know...the Core Set's been out for a week. But I already want to give FFG more of my money. I know some people (especially our friends in Europe) had some "insider info" that gave us an early date for the Core Set release. I was wondering if that was the case for the Hunt for Gollum or any other of the Adventure Packs.

According to some rumors May 28th might be likely. Nothing confirmed though!

According to a website that I've ordered many times from, it's supposed to be May 31. They also have Conflict at the Carrock on June 30. They are usually accurate with their dates. Those are for the US, not Europe.

Probably the same for Europe? We got the core set on the same day as the US, no?

Sadly a lot of countries are still waiting, the publishers here in Holland did not get the game this week (they got some CoC and a GoT monthy packs).

Hopefully next week, but that is already near 3 weeks after the first people in the US got their hands on the game.

I'm in the UK and still waiting for the core set. Retailer says 30 April, so hope to have the game after the weekend. Same retailer has the Hunt for Gollum up for release on 28 May (which, by extension, should mean an earlier release in the US).

On the pre-order page through Amazon.com, it says you can expect the release on June 30th!  Ugh, I certainly hope it isn't actually that far away.

I'm jonsing for the expansion too! My 28th was what I'd been hearing, but it doesn't seem to be definite.

 Yeah, considering it is already May 6th and the game is still listed as "At the Printers" as of the last update, I'm guessing late June? 

However, with the next two expansions in the same status, I suspect that they will be delivered a month apart, without any extra delays.
