After Gondorian Spearman (or any defending character) killed the attacking enemy with his response (or Goblin Cleaver), is he still considered a defending character to use Behind Strong Walls?

I can't see anywhere in the rulebook saying missing attacking enemy will immediately end the attack.

## 2 [muemakan on January 7, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/76836-behind-strong-walls/?do=findComment&comment=743756)

Yes.                  

## 3 [GrandSpleen on January 8, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/76836-behind-strong-walls/?do=findComment&comment=744749)

Actually, that is a great question.  From the manual:

 

"Characters that are declared as defenders are only considered to be defending through the resolution of the attack. Once an attack has resolved, the characters
are no longer considered “defenders,” but they do remain exhausted." (pg 18)
 
If Gondorian Spearman kills the attacking enemy, you have to consider the attack "resolved" (or never having taken place at all, depending on how you look at it?).  Behind Strong Walls is an Action, and not a Response, meaning you have to wait until an action window use it.  That suggests the following order….
 
1. Declare Gondorian Spearman an attacker.  The Spearman is now considered a "defender" and is eligible for Behind Strong Walls, BUT…
 
2. Now is your immediate and only opportunity to trigger the Spearman's response and place one damage token on the enemy.  You have an action window here, but if yo uchoose to play Behind Strong Walls at this point, you may no longer trigger the Spearman's Response.  If you DO trigger the response:
 
3. Enemy is immediately destroyed.
 
4. Because the enemy is destroyed, there is no attack and Gondorian Spearman is no longer a "defender." Spearman is no longer eligible for Behind Strong Walls.
 
So, the way I am reading this, you can either trigger the Spearman's Response OR you can use Behind Strong Walls on him, but you cannot do both.  
 
What do you think?

Interesting thought.

 

So, to see if understant it right, if you trigger Gondorian Spearman or, by that matter Spear of the Citadel, response, and your enemy as only 1 hit point remaining, then you kill your enemy and as the attack is resolved (o enemy to attack, so enemy attack ends), Gondorian Spearman or any defender with Spear of the Citadel is no longer considered a defender and is no longer regarded as an eligible to be the character affected by the action on Behind Strong Walls.

I agree with it. The response is imediate so if you play the action, you lose the opportunity to trigger the response.

the question is, in the rulebook it is only stated what will happen if the defender is missing (dead, or removed)

but mentioned nothing about what happen when the attacker is missing, you can assume the attack end immediately, but it is only assumption until clarified reir [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_scripts/ckeditor/plugins/smiley/images/reir.gif]

Interesting because there are conflicting arguments at other sites. I would think if the attack doesn't resolve it isn't satisfying the condition any longer and the response comes before action window. Reminds me of when vassal defended the tenticles and it all became neutralized. It would be nice for an official response on this.

If no one say they already have before 24hours from now, I will send the question. 

## 9 [Kassad on November 20, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/76836-behind-strong-walls/?do=findComment&comment=912969)

My inclination is that the attack is over, and therefor he is no longer a defender, as soon as his Response resolves killing the attacker and ending the combat step.  If you choose to skip his Response ability you can absolutely play Behind Strong Walls, but your window for his Response is now gone because you've played an Action and it is no longer within the "immediate window" of him being declared as a Defender.

 

On the other hand, I've seen stranger timing rulings so I would send them a question if it is eating at you >_<

## 10 [Nerdmeister on November 21, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/76836-behind-strong-walls/?do=findComment&comment=913605)

You could argue that the attack isn´t over. Most of the steps of the attack just do not have an effect any longer

Very fast response here :

 

> The rules say that a character is only considered a defender while resolving the attack. Once the attack ends that character is no longer "defending." Therefore, if a Gondorian Spearman destroys the attacking enemy with its Response, then the attack is resolved and the Spearman would not be a legal target for Behind Strong Walls.

Hi Folks,

I did not want to open a new thread ... after a the question if you can play Behind Strong Walls on a defending Gondor-character which is not exhausted my first thought was no. But others say yes .. so i asked Caleb:

> Quote
> 
> Hi Jan,
> You cannot play an event if it has no legal target. In this case, the legal target must be an exhausted defending Gondor character. Otherwise you cannot ready it.
> The second part of the effect depends on the first part being resolved because it begins with ‘that character’ and that refers to the character who was readied.
> Cheers,
> Caleb

That answer feels good for me, but for about 2 years i asked a similiar question refering to Elwing's Flight [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/199285-elwings-flight/?do=findComment&comment=2009550], so i asked him again about the differences:

> Quote
> 
> Hi Jan,
> The difference between Elwing’s Flight and Behind Strong Walls is that the ready effect and stat boost are part of the same effect in Elwing’s Flight whereas they are two separate effects on Behind Strong Walls. In order to have a legal target for Elwing’s Flight, you only need a questing character to receive the +1 WP, whereas the way Behind Strong Walls is worded requires that you need an exhausted Gondor defender.
> Cheers,
> Caleb

Ok .. i'm fine with this ruling and guessed it before asking. But one hour later i received a new email from Caleb:

> Quote
> 
> Hi Jan,
> We had a long discussion in the department about your rules question. The long and short of it is that I was basing my ruling off the idea that Behind Strong Walls is targeting an exhausted Gondor defender, but the other guys in the department pointed out that “ready” is the effect and “defending Gondor character” is the target. Basically, it’s written backwards from how I typically write my effects, so I was having a hard time seeing it that way. In any case, I need to revise my previous ruling about Behind Strong Walls. The answer is: “Yes, you can play Behind Strong Walls to give a ready Gondor defender +1 DEF because its only targeting requirement is that the defending character has the Gondor trait.” Sorry for the confusion.
> Cheers,
> Caleb

So .. in the end .. you can play Behind Strong Walls on a defending Gondor-character which is not exhausted... :-(

This would also mean that you can use Flame of Anor on Gandalf even if he is not ready.  That has previously been ruled illegal (thread here [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/175430-poisoned-counselsgandalfhobbit-pipes/]).  

We might end up seeing this ruling reversal getting reversed.  "Ready a defending Gondor character" pretty clearly indicates you need to have a character who can be readied.  So...he needs to be exhausted.  If the card said 'Exhaust a defending Gondor character' we would perceive that as the cost, but since 'readying' is a positive effect, we don't perceive it that way.  Even though the wording would be identical. If we can't trust the card wording, how are we supposed to parse card effects?

Anyway, allowing us to use a 'readying' effect on a ready character would probably lead to other problems.

Seriously stretching here, but Flame of Anor is mildly different in that it explicitly is a COST -> EFFECT wording in its first sentence where you cannot fulfill the EFFECT (in the case of a ready Istari). Behind Strong Walls is being parsed by Caleb here more like hero Sam's Response, where the target of the effect, a defending Gondor character, is undergoing two separate effects: 1. readying, 2. +1 DEF.

## 16 [PocketWraith on February 4, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/76836-behind-strong-walls/?do=findComment&comment=3198907)

Also the target of BSW is a defending Gondor character, whereas the target of the attack boost in Flame of Anor is the Istari you just readied.

## 17 [GrandSpleen on February 4, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/76836-behind-strong-walls/?do=findComment&comment=3199075)

The target of the 2nd sentence (the defense boost) in Behind Strong Walls is "that character."

Hmm. I think you should not be able to "ready" a ready character. That character must refer to  the character you just readied, which will be no one; therefore leaving no legal target.

I don't see the difference here between FoA and BSW. They both have costs (pay one resource; pay one resource, add to the victory display, and discard the top card) that are payed for to trigger an effect (ready a defending Gondor character, that character gets + defense; ready an Istari, that character gets + attack). In both cases though, I do think the target character must be exhausted (BSW clearly refers to "that character," whereas Sam has two different effects triggering off the engagement).

I can see how Sam and Elwing's Flight (and Lembas) work differently and don't require the target character to be exhausted, though. Thoughts?

The disconnect here may be that, for FoA, you are correct—"that character" refers to the Istari that was readied by the first part of the effect, and the ruling agrees with the general principle that indeed you cannot ready a character that is not exhausted.

But, per Caleb's last ruling above, for BSW, "that character" merely refers to a defending Gondor character. It is as if he is parsing it like the card was written as follows:

> Quote
> 
> Action: Choose a defending Gondor character. Ready that character. That character gains +1 [defense] until the end of the round.

i.e., that it's really two separate effects occurring sort of in parallel.

Why precisely FoA is not treated the same way is, I think we can all agree, rather confusing, but my presumption is that it's the specific "[cost] to [effect]" wording of its 1st sentence. I'd be curious to see how Caleb would respond if pressed on this point.

I think the reason is just a human one.  He didn't have FoA in mind during this discussion, and he forgot about the old ruling.

## 22 [Rouxxor on February 5, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/76836-behind-strong-walls/?do=findComment&comment=3199438)

In my opinion the real problem is that we don't rely on solid rules but on his human interpretation, who lead to confusing ruling like this.

## 23 [JanB on February 5, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/76836-behind-strong-walls/?do=findComment&comment=3199915)

For me, the ruling for BSW is a little bit odd. Action-Events are always "readable" like "Pay X resources to do the action". Why FoA is relevant because it has additional costs. It could be worded like ...

> Quote
> 
> As an additional cost to play Flame of Arnor, add Flame of Arnor to the victory display and discard the top card of your deck.
> 
> Action: Ready an Istari character you control. That character gets +X ATK until the end of the phase where X is the dicarded card's cost.

So it were equal to BSW. Otherwise .. if BSW were an action on a card in play (character or attachment) it would be worded like ...

> Quote
> 
> Action: Pay 1 tactics resource to ready a defending Gondor character. That character gets +1 DEF until the end of the phase.

So it were equal to FoA .. 

.. for reference:

and ... with Ever Vigilant i can spend 1 resource to ready an not exhausted ally ^^

The issue with translating BSW this way is that it privileges the first sentence in a way that the actual event itself does not. In a way, it would be more precise to say this:

> Quote
> 
> Action: Pay 1 tactics resource to ready a defending Gondor character and give that character +1 DEF until the end of the phase.

Or:

> Quote
> 
> Action: Pay 1 tactics resource to execute the following steps.
> 
>  * Ready a defending Gondor character.
>  * That character gains +1 DEF until the end of the phase.

which are subtly different from your formulation.

That said, maybe someone should reinquire about Flame of Anor. Maybe we'll get that ruling reversed. :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

That's the problem .. Flame of Arnor has the additional costs which makes the "to" important. And so your Istari character has to be exhausted.
I think, i will link Caleb this thread, so he can read it.. and decide.

## 26 [Wandalf the Gizzard on February 5, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/76836-behind-strong-walls/?do=findComment&comment=3200203)

Maybe all of these confusing effects could be read as "choose and ready." That way "that character" refers to the chosen character, readied or not.

I agree with you that the intention of BSW is that you ready the defending character, that is why my initial answer was that the defending character must be exhausted to be a legal target. However, as I examined the language closer with my coworkers, it became clear that the language on the card does not target an ‘exhausted’ defending Gondor character - just a defending Gondor character. Therefore, it is not a requirement that they be exhausted.

Well, ok then.

Here are some things you can do with this, that i thought you couldn't do (maybe other people thought otherwise?):

 * "Ready" Boromir every phase to get to Valour
 * Use Gimli (leadership)'s ability to give Legolas +1 even if he's not exhausted
 * Same for Legolas (Spirit) for boosting Gimli's willpower, although that has less utility
 * Discard a card every phase if Glorfindel ally is in play (trigger Galdor, power up Eregion Survivor, put the right type of card on the top of your discard pile for Sailor of Lune, get repeated uses out of Elven-light)
 * Discard Cram for no effect (this will combo with the upcoming Brand Leadership card for a free 'deck thinning' option, like putting 'We Are Not Idle' in non-dwarf decks)
 * Use Narya to give combat boosts to allies that were already ready
 * Exhaust Spare Hood & Cloak + attached character for no effect (the cloak won't even pass because the following sentence uses 'then').  I don't see much utility here. Only thing I can think of is ensuring that a Silvan elf will heal every round while a Silvan Tracker is in play.
 * Use Boomed & Trumpeted for its attack boost on a ready Ent character.  You could combo Song of Mocking or take undefended attacks to satisfy the damage part.
 * Use Common Cause to exhaust a character for no effect (again, poor utility, but legal)
 * Use Tale of Tinuviel and target a character that is already ready
 * Get the attack boost from Taste it Again on a character who is already ready

Some are significant upgrades.  There were times I couldn't apply Narya before because my ally wasn't exhausted, I'm sure of that. And I've definitely sent tactics Legolas questing, thinking I needed him to be exhausted.  So this alters tactical decisions.  Some of the effects of this ruling are pretty meaningless though (like Spare Hood & Cloak, weird but no big deal).  In general it gives more utility to every card affected. I don't see anything broken, but still.  Kind of surprised here.

## 29 [GrandSpleen on February 7, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/76836-behind-strong-walls/?do=findComment&comment=3203191)

If we get a Dale ally with a general action that returns him to your hand, you have an interesting combo.  Put the two recently spoiled heroes in: Brand (Leadership) and Bard son of Brand and get Cram into play.

-Play Cram on Dale ally, draw a card (per King Brand)

-Return ally to hand

-Get Cram back in your hand (per Bard's effect)

-Play Dale ally

-Play Cram (draw a card)

 

So if hypothetical ally costs 1, you get "spend 1 resource to draw 1 card," on par with Elven-light but you don't have to find a way to discard it, like you need to do with Elven-light.  If that ally costs 2, you get "spend 2 resources to draw 1 card," which is expensive and on par with Rod of the Steward.  

If it that ally costs 0, you have a broken combo that draws your whole deck, so-- minor limiting of design space, I guess.

You can not play Cram on an ally ;-)

Born Aloft is probably the card you want, 0-cost attachment that returns an ally to hand.  So if you have Bard, Brand II, and King of Dale with another attachment, you could play Long Lake Trader for free every turn, drawing a card in the process and still using him for his ability -- as long as you don't want to use King of Dale for some better ally.  That's pretty cool.

If you had an inherently 0-cost Dale ally you could get two cards each turn out of it.  In planning phase, play the ally, play Born Aloft on it (get a card), use Born Aloft, getting it back (Bard), play it again, and play Born Aloft on it again for another card.  Alas, the drawing ends there because Bard's ability is once per phase.  Pretty cool and powerful, but not draw-your-deck broken.

If you discard born aloft to get back the ally you will not return born aloft, since it is in discard pile at this moment.

You're right, I thought that Bard could get back any discarded attachments (once per phase), but it's only when a character leaves play.  So no repeatable combo with Born Aloft.  Born Aloft would still be worth a card draw and +1 willpower on an arbitrary attachment-free Dale ally, but with two other 0-cost attachments that are more useful I can't see it making a Dale deck.  Pity -- I like to see new cards revive old cards.

> Exhaust Spare Hood & Cloak + attached character for no effect (the cloak won't even pass because the following sentence uses 'then').  I don't see much utility here. Only thing I can think of is ensuring that a Silvan elf will heal every round while a Silvan Tracker is in play.



Exhaust a character can also be useful with Arwen ally ;). In this deck with 2 spare hood & cloack we can use twice per turn the boost of Arwen :).

Not all of these work. It's not that Caleb ruled that you can ready a ready character; his ruling is about targeting and the applicability of a second sentence using "that character" in compound effects.

Thus, each of your examples that purely ready—e.g., Boromir, Cram, ally Glorfindel—cannot be used as you say, since they have no effect other than to ready some character. Spare Hood shouldn't be valid either, as its second sentence starts with "Then".

In other words, you can't pay the costs to do something if there would be no effect OTHER than the cost payment.

It would indeed be a boost to Narya, Tale of Tinuviel, Taste It Again!, and Boomed & Trumpeted compared to how I'd been playing them, though.

Caleb's explanation above just mentions that Behind Strong Walls can target a ready Gondor character because it doesn't explicitly state that the character needs to be exhausted.  He repeated that point when discussing Flame of Anor, but didn't mention a secondary effect as requisite for that point to remain true.  So currently it seems that you can do all of the things I typed above.  

If your deck is empty, I wonder can you play Mithrandir's Advice?  Same idea here, paying a cost for no effect.

(whoops, you're right, no Cram on allies, but Spare Hood & Cloak and Born Aloft are 0-point attachments that would also work, should we ever see a Dale ally that is returned to hand)

I disagree on your interpretation of Caleb's words, but I'm sending in a specific query to see if you can ready a ready character in lieu of other effects.

The ruling I gave was that neither of those cards explicitly target an exhausted character. Both of those cards have additional effects that can be resolved even if the target character is not exhausted. BSW gives +1 DEF and Flame of Anor gives an attack boost. Therefore, both cards have the potential to affect the board even if the target character is not readied.

So if Boromir is ready,  you cannot raise your threat by 1 to ready him because it has no effect. Similarly, you cannot play Ever Vigilant to ready an ally who is ready because again it has no effect.

So BSW and Flame of Anor work because it does something besides ready, but Boromir and Ever Vigiliant do not work on a ready character because all they do is ready.

So Cram and Unexpected Courage and Common Cause can't ready a ready character because that's all they do.  But Boomed and Trumpeted and Tale of Tinuviel would work, because they both ready *and* boost, same as BSW.  Multiple Taste it Again! should be legal.  Narya can be used on ready allies.  I'm not sure about LeGimli/SpLegolas boosting each other, because it seems like you'd have to ready them *before* checking the "if that hero is <name>" -- however since the outcome of the check is 100% predictable, maybe it also works.  But Legolas certainly couldn't discard a card (e.g. Elven-light) to ready a non-Gimli hero who is already ready.

Well that clarifies things, thanks for sending the query.  

My take-home from this: when triggering an effect, you are able to target a character who is only eligible for a portion of that effect.  But there does need to be some kind of eligibility (something needs to affect the board state).

Sound correct?

I think that's correct. It still seems weird to me that you can ready a ready character.

## 42 [dalestephenson on February 7, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/76836-behind-strong-walls/?do=findComment&comment=3203892)

Technically, Caleb is NOT saying you can "ready a ready character".  He's just saying that if an action/response affecting a character *includes* readying, you can still do it to a ready character if it does something *else* that affects the character.  BSW doesn't ready a ready Gondor defender, but it still can be played to give a Gondor defender +1 defense.

In fact, Caleb explicitly said If a card’s only effect is to ready a character, then you cannot play it on a ready character because it will not affect the board, which is close to saying you cannot ready a ready character.

This whole set of rulings is in keeping with a previous partial-fulfillment ruling:

(Please note that I am linking only the explicit ruling, not my commentary in that post [which was subsequently shown to be incorrect]. I still don't get the Daeron's Runes ruling lower in that thread and what it means for the semantics of "then", though it is irrelevant to our current discussion.)

I had already been using Narya on ready allies. Glad I don't have to change my ways. I think this rules issue was settled quite well.

## 45 [Rouxxor on February 16, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/76836-behind-strong-walls/?do=findComment&comment=3216140)

I had a discussion about cram. Could it be discard if the attached hero is already ready? To me it can but I came here to get a confirmation.

## 46 [GrandSpleen on February 16, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/76836-behind-strong-walls/?do=findComment&comment=3216324)

No, you can't (Caleb's quoted ruling a few posts above this one makes it clear).
