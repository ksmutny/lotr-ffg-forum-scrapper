Hey everyone, there's a chance to ask the head of FFG Studios anything you want about any game! He'll be answering some of the questions on the FFG live stream this Friday

Yes! And like other people's comments asking about LOTR. After 25 or so they get a ribbon noting them as popular and that may be how we can get it asked. I have one half way down on the third page that has got a fair bit of likes but could use some more if you want to show support and ask questions about LOTR LCG future.

I’ll be honest: after watching him dodge questions after the In-Flight Report I’m not too hyped about hearing anything relevant.

@General_Grievous [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/183728-general_grievous/]

 

they answered you! He mentioned a "break" after the planned releases, which will carry through late 2020, then he said they would announce future content and a new "iteration" of the game, or something like that. But he stressed it was not a "second edition."

## 6 [Bullroarer Took on August 31, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/299409-ffg-ama-with-andrew-navarro/?do=findComment&comment=3774732)

I'm glad they answered the question and hat's off even though it wasn't necessarily what I wanted to hear.  If the next iteration is first or second age though that would be nice.

Next iteration of the game? At least it's not a second edition, but what could a "next iteration" mean? Slower release schedule like boxes only, no cycles? Crossovers with the digital offerings? Cleaned up rules, as a revised edition but fully compatible? New core set and player facing expansions like a premade deck ready to go and then quest packs similar to Marvel LCG? Return to "X" like expansions? Bundled content so there's less SKUs on the market? Competitive mode being default but expanded?

And them taking a break before the new iteration has my cynical self thinking they'll be shuffling around designers, maybe Caleb will jump ship to Marvel similar to what Matt did for Arkham? Hmm... I'm cautiously optimistic. And I guess this is the last cycle? Or do you think we'll see another one squeezed in before now and late 2020?

Well good to know but definitely sad, end of a journey. At least there is something else to look forward too whatever it is. And so, so happy it's not a second edition haha.

I feel like this is the final cycle just based on release times and the setting.

I am really happy that it's not. I like the deep card pool that we have, and a 2.0 version would be severely lacking in deckbuilding options for many years.

But second edition wouldn't take your deep card pool away. Nothing stops you from playing first edition while second edition is developing. Plus, when game first release, they develop significantly faster than 1 adventure pack in 3 years like lotr lcg currently has, another very compelling reason why lotr should go for second edition.

But the new cards would be incompatible with the old. So I could not make use of the wealth of 1.0 cards when making a 2.0 deck. By not making it 2.0, it means that the new cards will be a lot more fun to deckbuild with.

And regarding the slower release pace, I'm actually OK with that. Because of the non-rotating card pool, every new set of player cards that comes out has a lot more deckbuilding combinations than the set that came before. And we've gotten to the point where it takes a really long time to explore all those combinations. For example, I play this game a lot, but still haven't touched Radagast yet because I'm still busy exploring a bunch of other card combos.

Then there's the really cool stuff they can do with a big card pool, like the new Contract card type. Such a thing wouldn't be possible for a 2.0 game for a long time.

Edit: And I'm aware of how the release cycle is faster at the beginning. I was playing this game from day 1. But it still took years for the deckbuilding to mature.

But you'll still have this giant wealth of 1.0 cards to deckbuild with? By not making it 2.0, they get stuck in the past and cannot sufficiently move forward. Not letting something improve so that you would have more toys to play with while you have endless supply of toys to play with is selfish.

I've been watching the game improve for years, and that improvement has not plateaued, in my opinion. So I don't see myself as selfish (for that reason at least).

The things you're trying to pass as improvement is not the improvements the game needs. Not wanting to game to improve because you want to keep getting more cards for it with the already insane card pool is selfish, no matter what spin you'll try to put on it.

To the video: Hahaha love that they processed it in the general Grievous voice hahaha

 

To this topic. I think second editions are terrible and a bit of a money grab. It's what pushed my wife and eventually me by extension away from X-Wing and it would do the same here for us. This the LOTR game we want and we are nowhere close to a broken crazy bloated game like many others become.

Well, I can say the same thing.

The improvements that could come with a 2.0 are not the improvements the game needs. Wanting the game to reset because you are personally unhappy with the game's direction etc. etc.

Nah, broseph, if game resets, you still have the giant behemoth with years and years worth of content and gameplay. You don't lose anything, except maybe a few packs they still gonna maybe release after those already planned? And judging by FFG's other edition improvements, what you are saying is not a possibility, every existing new edition for a past game that I am aware of was a tremendous improvement, be it LCG or a board game.  So, if we used the selfishness scale for this situation, you're selfish by around 99/100, while I'm selfish by 1/100. I have most of the first edition purchased too, you know. I will too "lose" if they were to decide to release second edition. But it is right thing to do for the game to move forward.

Co-op LCGs have it even better for new editions. Old stuff is 100% playable. Just regard the game as coming to a natural end.

I see some 2nd editions as acceptable. Stuff like Thrones and X-wing where they were pioneers. It lets them work out the kinks they picked up while experimenting and really streamline things.

Thankfully, the head of FFG studios disagrees. According to him, the majority of the playerbase does not want a 2.0. Shouldn't demanding that you want personally, that most of the playerbase does not want, be the selfish position?

But to be clear, FFG doesn't owe me any product that I haven't paid for. Yet I want them continue the game forever. So in that sense, I am selfish. I can admit that.

## 23 [dalestephenson on August 31, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/299409-ffg-ama-with-andrew-navarro/?do=findComment&comment=3774985)

I'm very glad to hear that the new product after the "break" will be fully compatible, for the same reasons as Seastan.  While a new, incompatible version wouldn't "take away" anything from the vast amount of possibilities already in the system, it also would add not a whit.  It would be as irrelevant to this game as Journeys In Middle Earth or War of the Ring.

John Constantine is correct that the decision to make later content fully compatible *necessarily* precludes mechanical changes that could, in theory, produce a "better" LCG, and in that sense is preventing the 2.0 from being made.  We've already seen with the computer version that the freedom to depart from the established cardpool while retaining the artwork can result in a different game, quite possibily a superior game in the eyes of some.  But no matter how good it is mechanically, I don't see how the necessarily restricted card pool of a rebooted game can compete for my time with the vast options of the current game, and given that I can't see it attracting my money.  LOTR is my favorite IP, hands down, but if I'm going to spend on a new co-op LCG I'll try out the ugy-looking Marvel game.

I am, of course, selfishly putting my own interests ahead of John's interests, and he is doing the same to me.  FFG naturally will put its own interests first, which is why they're taking a "break" of unspecified duration instead of pumping out more content continually as I would prefer.

A break after planned releases through late 2020 does make it seem this is the last cycle, which increases the chances of the final quest actually being in Mordor.  (From the encounter sets I think there's no chance that a majority of the cycle will be there).  That makes me think we won't explore much of Rhun, and will leave at the break vast parts of Middle Earth still unexplored.

I disagree with the word "necessarily" here. This "new, non-2.0 iteration" of the game could still include a list of card errata and mechanical changes that fix some legacy issues with the game while still maintaining backward compatibility. I'm not saying it will happen, but it is a possibility.

## 25 [dalestephenson on August 31, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/299409-ffg-ama-with-andrew-navarro/?do=findComment&comment=3774991)

True.  I'd be surprised if the new iteration didn't cause errata at a minimum, and I wouldn't be shocked if it was not, in fact, fully backwards compatible with the entirety of the cardpool -- For example, I could well imagine adding new mechanics that nothing in the existing cardpool is relevant to, resulting in new player cards that are useless against past quests, or mechanical changes that make some old player cards uesless against future quests.  He clearly doesn't know how large the changes from the "new iteration" would be, I get the impression that aside from the intention to produce a "new iteration" that is not a second edition, no thought has been given to it at all.

But the decision to make the new iteration not be a second edition *does* impose massive design constraints compared to a complete reboot.

I'm not sure that he disagrees, he just lays down the facts (tbh I don't think somebody in his position even takes part in decisions like these, those are usually made by people directly involved). I think there is much more reasons behind not doing second edition than simple "0.001% of the playerbase that are vocal on the forums don't want it". If I was a betting man, my money would be on the risk of it not returning as much profit and/or licensing issues being the actual main reason for that.

I don't know how they can "reiterate" the game with so many cards being designed around the old rules. Some cards gonna function differently under the new rule set, some cards might break at all.

I hope that with all this, at least Caleb won’t have the time to release more erratas.

Obviously all the “erratas allow to open new card development strategies” argument is not valid anymore.

I understand the argument, that development slows over time, but your math/counting is a bit off. Since August 2016, which would be 3 years ago, we have seen 3 new deluxe expansions and 15 adventure packs, not 1 adventure pack.

Hyperbole, from a Greek word meaning "excess," is a figure of speech that uses extreme exaggeration to make a point or show emphasis.

Fact check, a term in modern English, refers to the act of verifying the accuracy or near accuracy of claims that are made. It does not distinguish hyperbole from non-fact.

It was never supposed to be a factually correct statement. All this statement was trying to convey is that this game is releasing products at a turtle pace, which it does. Like, I made it so obvious - 1 pack in 3 years, and you still took it at face value? Lmao.

So August 2016 to present is 3 deluxe and 15 APs.  For comparison to the original pace of the game, 3 years from the release of Hunt for Gollum (July 2011 through July 2014, inclusive) has 3 deluxes, 20 APs, and 3 saga expansions.  That's faster, even if you ignore the parallel saga boxes, but not vastly so.

I'm not sure I agree that a new-iteration-after-a-break would necessarily be at the current pace, or that a reboot would necessarily develop and release quicker than a largely/entirely compatible "new iteration" would.

I'm not judging by how it used to release at the beginning, I'm juding by how other fresh LCG releases come out now.

What I don't quarrel with is the idea that an incompatible reboot *needs* an aggressive release schedule in order to get to the size of the card pool where deckbuilding would be interesting -- in the current card pool, you pretty much need the whole first cycle to get to 50-card decks without filler, let alone making thematic decks.  Heck, here's how the historical tribal decks were 3 years after the release of the first AP (through Three Trials/Black Riders; 39 months after release of core):

Eagles --  fully formed but weak; it would take Hirgon/TaEowyn to take it to the next step.

Dwarves -- fully formed and likely more powerful than now, thanks to errata [Dwarrowdelf/Hobbit]

Gondor -- fully formed [AtS]

Outlands -- fully formed [AtS]

Hobbit -- viable for hobbit heroes [Black Riders], non-existent for allies

Rohan -- fair amount of cards, but needing SpTheoden

Silvan -- Celeborn/Tree People released, no O Lorien and enter-plays Silvans thin on the ground

Ent -- no Ents released at all

Dunedain -- no unifying principle, let alone enablers

Noldor -- no unifying principle, let alone enablers

Harad -- non-existent

Dale -- one hero and one overpriced, useless ally

Woodmen -- non-existent

Beorning -- Beorn hero, Beorn ally, and the overpriced coaster Beorning Beekeeper

So after three years, three months there were five viable tribal decks, and two years from core release (Heirs of Numenor) there were just three.  A "second iteration" that can draw from the existing card pool can create new archtypes with a single card (see contracts).  The most recent cycle created three new tribal archtypes while simultaneously giving *major* support to Eagles, Silvans, and Hobbits.  A reboot *plus* a complete cycle might get you to the point where you can build a decent 50-card deck, as long as it's not monosphere.

Of course, since a second reboot isn't constrained by compatibility, it could abandon entirely the idea of mix-n-match heroes and cards, instead focusing around self-contained heroes that carry their own decks with them -- this would let them create viable decks from day one -- it would also fundamentally change one of the greatest attractions of the current game -- it wouldn't be an incompatible "better version" of the current game, it would be a completely different game sharing theme and artwork.

FFG has already made an incompatible version sharing artwork, theme, and some mechanical elements for the  computer.  How many players of this game have abandoned this to play it instead?

Why?  Are there any second editions of cooperative LCGs to compare to?

If you imagine a second edition would release at the same pace as a brand new cooperative LCG, we know the Marvel Champions has an *intended* release schedule of once per month, with the majority being hero packs and minority being scenario packs, with no announced schedule for "Campaign expansions".  Sounds very much like the *intended* release schedule for LOTR to me.  The significant difference to me is the separation of player cards from scenarios, and the alteration of deckbuilding to make heroes come with synergistic deck element, at the expense of the combinations possible in LOTR LCG.

I have now watched the video and put myself in the “cautiously optimistic “ category.  Caleb has talked about bringing more of a story telling or saga style element into the game and maybe that’s what’s being envisioned here.

Regarding the 2.0 vs 1b argument, put me firmly in the 1b category.  I’m not saying the game is perfect, but I don’t believe the game’s problems are structural.  Yes, Spirit and Lore got too much of the color pie and Tactics and Leadership didn’t get enough, but I don’t believe that can’t be handled with errata or future cards.  I do not want to go back to the very limited card pool we had for so many years.  Furthermore, if there was a complete reboot people would be wanting the sagas all over and I don’t think the designers really want to go back there again.

So, lately I've been reading my older D&D books, mainly 3e. In there, 3e had a revision early in it's life called 3.5. 3.0 content is still fully compatible with 3.5 content, with just a few tweaks. I wouldn't be surprised if the new iteration for LotR was a revision that is fully backwards compatible. A 1.5 if you will. It could be cleaned up rules, errata and balance for the 1.5 revision and a new way to deliver content that isn't cycles. Hmm... just a shower thought.

Am I the only one who thought that the «new iteration» was refering to the release format? No more cycles + DE but a different product, instead of a new game experience (be it 2.0 or 1.b).

I thought he was hinting at some new way to distribute the game, like Arkham (return to), L5R (clan packs) and Marvel (campaign, hero and villan decks) are already doing?

It seems like FFG is trying to move away from the cycle releases, and what Andrew said fits right into it.

AGoT is finishing the house DEs soon too. We might also get news of a different product type moving forward. Anything that would attract new players seems good to me. A new point of entry into the game.

That is a completely reasonable interpretation of what he said.

I'm also hoping for campaign supplements for earlier cycles

I dont really play LotR that much. Mostly when a friend brings it out.

What is the difference in the pies?

color pie is a concept from mtg that basically splits the pie that are game mechanics between the colors equally so each color (sphere) feels unique and has something to offer players. If one color (sphere) starts getting the fragments of the pie originally reserved for the other it is considered that the color is better than the others. 

For example, in original lotr lcg color pie lore had the card draw. As time passes, every other sphere got some form of it too. Tactics had strong defenders, then spirit beregond happened. etc. Sphere are more of a direction now than restriction

I would have said it much worse than than this.

In the early days Spirit got questing, cancellation, recursion and threat reduction.  It also got the ability to attack the staging area without engaging the enemy.  So it could handle all phases of the game very well.

Tactics got combat, but not terribly better than the other spheres.  It did get the ability to generate progress through combat, but if you say that only about one third of the encounter deck is enemies then it can only generate progress one third of the time.  Meanwhile its threat is spiraling because it can’t quest.

Why a break though?  Lack of man power while designers develop Marvel content?  Time to develop the new “iteration?”

Probably because other LCGs (Marvel and GoT) are going to pilot new content formats, and they want to wait and see how they are recieved.

Yeah I know colour pie theory.

I was just curious what the division for LotR was.

I just really hope they keep the reprinting going.

I feel this game would be more successful with a better reprinting of deluxe sets first and foremost. I have friends struggling to find deluxe sets in the UK. FFG reprint quest packs from time to time but what's the point when there's not enough deluxe sets out there that the quest packs require. Buying a quest pack for the player cards only (because you cant play the quest without the deluxe counterpart) is poor. The deluxe to quest pack tie-in model only really works if you can guarantee market supply and demand of the deluxe enabler. 

The LCG model was a new innovation in card gaming for those burnt out on the rare-chasing nature of previous collectable trading games. FFG boasted no rares to chase... everyone gets everything in the pack. But by the lack of reprints coming they've made cards extremely rare and chaseable as people in the second hand market puts these sets on sale at ridiculously expensive prices and are now even selling singles for stupid prices. The game as become that horrible collectors nightmare that LCGs were created to not be.. 

So I hope a second or new iteration firstly solves this problem and creates exciting jumping on points for new players.

 

I'd like to see a completely new core set (that's not a second edition) but the start of a new campaign with player new cards in it and army/faction cards and treasures and player card locations. Clarified and explained rules. Then the packs can be like the new marvel releases- one pack is one complete scenario focusing on a lieutenant or location. And hero packs that focus on a hero his/her race, Havens, factions, events, contracts and equipment.

Easy mode, and nightmare need to be better incorporated into the game rather than separate nightmare packs too. 

****, I'd even love for a silmarilion version of the game that's compatible.

I love this game and have everything but I have friends desperate to spend their cash on this game but cant get packs and deluxes for love nor money.

Maybe it's time to speculate on what might be arriving in this Cycle, before the development break in LOTR LCG. Perhaps a Spirit Aragorn hero, or maybe a Scouring of the Shire AP? What about an eagle hero? Or perhaps a hint/taste of Second Age Middle Earth?

We've all been anticipating many of these things...think FFG will try to cram them into the final APs?

They don't have the rights to Second Age, and I don't think Scouring will be a part of the cycle, as it is at the other side of the world. But it could be the 2020 Gen Con scenario, if we get one. As for player cards, it has been speculated that Wilyador would be in this cycle, which I am all for. Spirit Aragorn is also reasonably certain, as it would be a nice tie-back to the Core Set if the last hero of this cycle matches the very first hero we ever got in the Core Set. As for other things FFG will cram into the cycle, we have seen a bunch of fan-requested cards in this cycle and the last one already, so I hope they continue this trend. Getting Tom Bombadil makes me think some other big cards are on the horizon, though I can't think of anyone off the top of my head. Blue Wizards would be nice, but again, licencing...

Hold on. 

Does FFG have the rights to the Fourth Age? 😮

FFG has the rights to the text of Hobbit/LOTR, and that includes the appendices.  This includes a complete tale of years for the Second Age and Third Age, and the Fourth Age to the end of the Fellowship.  There is only limited information about the First Age, though several of the key stories are referred to or given in poetic form in the main text.  Bottom line, FFG *could* do past stories without any permission from the Tolkien estate.

Whether they *would* do it is a separate question -- the original war of the Ring isn't remotely as well known as LOTR/Hobbit, and that's also true about the first age stories even without license issues.  I'm afraid Dreamchaser is as close as we'll get to Numenor (although if memory serves, they referred to information not found in the main text or appendices).  The self-imposed setting between Bilbo's party and Frodo leaving the Shire also restricts the more recent past, like the Goblin-Dwarf wars or Thorongil's war against Umbar (and some other named characters who could otherwise appear in the game).  But the Siege of Annuminas shows that the designers are willing to step well outside the time period, and the change of attitude of the Tolkien Estate shows that licensed Silmarillion products are now in the realm of possibility (though sadly, I doubt for what Asmodee would be willing to pay).

The fact that they said they aren't doing a 2.0 but are putting out some other iteration of the game has me very intrigued.  They done alot of interesting things with the design over the last few years that proves if you restructure the game the player card pool still holds up.  I think that would be extremely interesting if the new iteration was a different type of product that was still compatible with the current player card pool.  Andrew seems to say that Terminal Directive for Netrunner wasn't that successful, but I thought that was an awesome way to get lapsed and casual players excited while also offering up something for the die hard players.

I don't know that  LOTR LCG 2.0 is a good idea at this point anyway considering they already brought two other co-op LCGs to market, and that move will likely alienate some die hard players.  Though you do have a pretty sizable customer base of both die hard and lapsed players.  If they could find a product that could appeal to both segments then I think that's the way to go.   As a lapsed player I'd be excited to exercise my player cards again on some new experience.  One that didn't require so much of my time, money and attention like a monthly pack release would.

I listened to the clip everyone is referencing and I had the distinct impression that Navarro was talking about the Game of Thrones LCG. Do I just need to go back further? When exactly does he talk about LOTR LCG?

Sorry, probably my fault… Or rather, FFG's fault for editing the YouTube vid after initially posting it. 😡 I have updated the post on the first page of this thread with the now-proper timestamp.

No need to apologize my good Wizard and thank you. I guess I just join the throngs of people waiting with anticipated interested to see what the game will look like after 2020. That should give me enough time to completely catch up and finish my collection too. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I wanted to have an expansion entirely dedicated to the Hobbits, but most likely it will never be done.

Otherwise, It is the best game I've ever played.

That's all. Thanks FFG for making me dream!
