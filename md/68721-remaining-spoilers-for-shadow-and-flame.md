That's a pretty cool Tactics card but… only 1 Tactics card in this pack and an extra Lore card again? They REALLY don't like giving Tactics much help lol.

Great stuff. We Are Not Idle will be a strong complement to Lure of Moria, and Hands Upon a Bow is a nice way for Tactics to generate progress tokens by picking off enemies during quest resolution. Risk Some Light is nuts in a secrecy deck, and provides enough information/deck manipulation to be valuable even at a cost of 3. The Spirit event seems opposed to the aims of a secrecy deck, since it will likely send your threat above 20 if used to eliminate a particularly nasty enemy. Still, the potential to just get rid of a Witch-king, Hill Troll, or other monstrous foe is pretty staggering.

i just realised i can now use rivendell bow, and brand has just bumped up on the list….these cards just keep getting better.

and great art by magali- if thats how she portrays wood elves then i see we have much to look forward to when we get to silvan cards

so ive been looking at the enounter cards….am i correct in assuming the only way to get rid of durins bane is the location dark pit effect?

so i assume we sort of drive it back into the pit?

Hands Upon a Bow should have been in the Core set.  Glad to finally get it.  However…

Mentally planning my deck with this card (and knowing the Balrog is going to be hanging out in the staging area) I went back and looked at Rivendell Bow:  "If attached character has a PRINTED ranged keyword, it gets +1 [Attack] during a ranged attack."  Why the use of the word printed?  Can RB not be used in conjunction with Dunedain Cache?

 

Edit:  I mean to say that if you are using Rivendell Bow with Dunedain Cache you don't get the +1?  I guess so.

Yes this secrecy card is crazy overpower cose for 4 spirit resources you can get rid of very important quests encounter cards (like a witch-king).

Very crazy powerful.

 The much maligned Dunedain Wanderer will cost only 2 during the early stages of the game now and has the Ranged keyword. Hmmm…

Have we any more input on whether dunedain cache makes the hero get a +1 or not?

richsabre said:

With a strict reading of those two cards I would say no. Then again I don't think "printed" has been clearly defined in this game yet, so they could rule it different than every other card game ever made and say that when you gain abilities it becomes 'printed' on that card or something.

Wouldn't be the first time…

Printed means exactly what one would think it means. If the card actually has "Ranged." physically in its text box, it gains +1 attack from the Bow. Dunedain Cache gives a hero the ranged keyword, but it's not "printed." No attack bonus.

 

## 21 [richsabre on August 7, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/68721-remaining-spoilers-for-shadow-and-flame/?do=findComment&comment=670161)

OFFICIAL ANSWER

 

Hi Richard,
Good question. The answer is no. The "printed ranged keyword" is used to identify characters with the keyword printed right on them as opposed to characters who gain the ranged keyword through card effects such as Dunedain Cache.
Cheers!
Caleb
 

Thanks for the super fast response Caleb

Yeah Rich, from what I can tell about the goal of the scenario, is that we have to push him back into the pit to rid him from play.  Of course, there is only one pit card, but it also looks like the Quest Deck is going to be smaller than a lot of the others.

 I was planning on first attempting this quest with my Ninja Twins deck, but Gimli, loaded up with Citadel Plates, Khazad!, Heavy Stroke and Unseen Strike are telling me to pull my Three Hunters deck back out.  And of course Legolas works well with Rivendell Bow and Hands Upon…

Once again the deck is going to have Watchful Eyes in it though and the twins laugh that card off.

'We are not idle' is yet another card that replaces itself and can be played with 0 cost.  If you have both this and runes in list, you can get produce an incredibly tight deck.  They really need to stop making cards that work like this.

One of my first thoughts as well. You don't even need a single dwarf in your deck to do this…

Maybe, but it's a darn good card. Probably better than Quick Strike in many instances (provided you have a beefy ranged character, of course). Along with Hail of Stones, it's the closest thing Tactics has to a conditional willpower booster.

Honestly, Hands Upon should have been in the core set.  Combined with Quick Strike it effectively lets Tactics quest the best way they can.  (By killing things!)

That is true. Makes ranged somewhat viable solo. I'm imagning a deck with Hama, Boromir and Dunhere along with this tactics card to snipe and cycle prime targets in the staging area. :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 I have been.  I don't like Hama thematically, but with this combination he is hard to overlook.

Yeah, Hama just opens up so many possibilities. You'd need a Dunedain Cache or something (since none of those heroes have ranged), or you could just throw Legolas in your lineup. Some Unseen Strikes for Dunhere, three copies of Hail of Stones, some Feints--could be a pretty fun little build.

You'll need two copies of Hands (or some way to generate extra attacks with Hama) if you want to use that effect every turn, but it will indeed be powerful if you can set it up.

I do have a question about Dark Pit. Is the 3 card max for the total group or for each player? Can a group of 4 players exhaust 3 characters each for a total of 12? Seems like that would make the game a whole lot easier.

you must have the printed range keyword, meaning, the word ranged on the hero, not obtained through an equipment card. Hama can never use this ability. You'd have to include brand or legolas.

are you referring to hands upon the bow? if so you just need the character to have ranged- so cache on a character would allow them to do this

The "Printed Ranged Keyword" is for Rivendell Bow to gain +1 attack I think.

My reading would be that Dark Pit allows each *individual* player ("you") to take this Refresh Action.

All players can take this action separately, and indeed each player can take it as many times as they like, but you can't add more than the max three for each attempt, or add the totals together.

This would be consistent with all other cards, as (I think) "you" always refers to one specific individual player, not the players as a group.

That makes way more sense and the "You control" text would seem to imply that only one player is triggering the effect.

This is correct. Compare Dark Pit to Doors of Durin, which expressly states that its effect may only be triggered once per round. During the refresh phase, each player may trigger Dark Pit as many times as desired/allowed by the number of ready characters he or she has in play.
