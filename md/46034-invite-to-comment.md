 I am currently running the first play by forum game of this over at BGG javascript:void(0);/*1304172615173*/ [http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/647735/pbf-game-1/page/1] We are doing the 3rd and final scenario 4 players. Feel free to comment on the thread.

 The Players have just finished the first turn in this Play by Forum game.  As Umpire I don't advise, but I think they let an opportunity pass in not allowing Gimli to go 'berserk'

Again feel free to leave comments on the thread.

 Second Turn Finished. 

 

Glorfindel has been freed, and the Nazgul are now upon them

 The Players easily completed the Escape from Dol Guldur in 4 turns.

 

I really feel the game has scaling issues with 4 players. No matter, easily fixed ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]
