Hey man! I just bumped up your forum game thread today.  Nobody had touched it for 10 days short of a full year.  Since you appeared only a few hours after I posted in the thread, I thought I must have pressed the 'Activate Rich' button or something from posting there.   :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

Welcome back.  Now you can patiently wait with all the rest of us for the next expansions (Road Darkens, Dunland Trap) because you know we have all been very patient.......

Activate Rich Button ... sounds awesome...though I think a lot of people would rather have the deactivate version of it :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] thanks for bumping my thread! I cant even remember that far back....

## 21 [mr.thomasschmidt on May 10, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/105931-im-back/?do=findComment&comment=1079527)

Welcome back my friend. I haven't leafy the forum but I have only read the headlines in the forum since about Christmas. And just like DurinIII I made my first post for long a couple of days ago and was beginning to think where you where. I even checked to see if I had just missed your posts but saw that your latest post was way back. So was beginning to worry. But there you are, safe and sound. Where you "looking ahead and came back when you looked behind" ? ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

Well... Basically the developers have taken the awesomeness of this game up a level. Black Riders was great making balanced and fun mechanics and this current cycle coming out looks very promising to revive old awesome cards (eagles, secrecy) fill out some other traits and develop ones like Silvan really well. I'm super excited for the games future as things have only gotten better! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

## 23 [legolas18 on May 10, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/105931-im-back/?do=findComment&comment=1079581)

Welcome back rich! Any time I feel down in this game I read your posts and your enthusiasm is infectious. A wizard is never late indeed!

Glad to have you back on the forums, rich! You're right on time - we seem to have a very exciting cycle to look forward to.

Definitely second that!!!

Hello, richsabre. 

 

(psst, would anyone mind telling me who are we celebrating in this thread? (I am relatively new here) I mean, is there a story or sth?)

 

In any case, I am glad you came dude, whoever you might be. Everyone seems to be enthusiastic and courteous about it, and I say this forum needs some more niceness and manners.

## 34 [chuckles on May 13, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/105931-im-back/?do=findComment&comment=1082388)

Welcome back Richsabre - I recall you as of the friendliest and most enthusiastic members on this board ...and i'm a little surprised you haven't put up a new poll yet :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

## 36 [richsabre on May 13, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/105931-im-back/?do=findComment&comment=1082971)

thank you kind sirs! :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] and yes, a poll - I need another don't I? :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

in reply to Mich the One ...well...I guess you could say im no one! :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] but I did post obsessively here, and after a few months of silence I think I gave the impression I was in the undying lands or something ... .or worse :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

## 37 [lleimmoen on May 13, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/105931-im-back/?do=findComment&comment=1083032)

What? Who is he you say? He is the Man! He is Gandalf the White, or Moby the Goldfish (a bit confused now). No, I have it now, he is my friend!

 

You don't have any friends! Gollum!

## 38 [Pericles on May 13, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/105931-im-back/?do=findComment&comment=1083126)

This thread has gotten way too touchy-feely for my tastes.  Therefore, I shall be the voice of dissent.

 

Be gone, foul wizard!  Return to the darkness from whence you came!

 

(Just kidding, rich.  You know I love you!)
