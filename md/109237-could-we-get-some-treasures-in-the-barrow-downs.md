I was just reading through an old news post about the Black Riders [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=4209] [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=4209%5D] and there is a little line in there which hints that we might be getting some more treasure cards in the future...

"We decided, for now, to let Treasure cards remain a special feature of The Hobbit boxes and come up with something new for The Lord of the Rings" (that bit that says "for now")

I didnt mind the way they did the treasures in the hobbit boxes, but i always thought it was a bit of a shame that you couldnt use them on more quests. If you went to all that trouble of winning them, then you want to get some use out of them.

And now I'm thinking that this new barrow downs quest they've mentioned is a great place for them to give us some treasures. Im a bit rusty with the books, but didnt they pick up all their weapons in the barrow downs?

That would be great place for some treasure cards because its still very early in the saga, and they will be worth winning because we can still use them for tonnes of quests

The other obvious place for treasures is lothlorien, where they get given some presents by galadriel. That will be early enough in the saga to get some use out of them as well.

I think the treasures cards could work quite well in the saga, much better than they did in the hobbit boxes, because the campaign is so much longer

great idea :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

yes, the hobbits were given their swords by bombadil after he got rid of the wights, other places that come to mind is moria (there has to be some cool artifcacts hidden down there), lothlorien as you say, oh, and perhaps places where there are armouries... like helms deep, minas tirith.

So, I understand what they are doing wiyh treasure cards but I do not really like it. I want cards I can build into all of my decks and use during every quest, not just specific ones. What I liked about Decipher's LOTR game (among many things) was the superfluousness of items boyhood character specific and general. It seems that this game is still trying to figure out just how to go about the mechanics of some items: do we make them quest specific treasure items or all the time items. Just make the items and allow the players to play or not play them.

The typo "boyhood" above should read "both". Stupid auto correct!

I guess there won't be any treasures, but there are already boons weapons and armours spoiled (sting and glamdring). After all, boon and treasures differ only in names, the new thing is burden and they changed name so that people wouldn't use arkenstone in lord of the rings campaign

Dagger of Westernesse was in the Black Rider box...

i completely forgot they had already been spoiled. ah well, i guess that's the end of treasures then. not  much point doing them in the saga boxes if they going to leave out some of the most famous ones

I agree. If it were me designing the game, I would either just not make treasures and boons at all (well, except for character traits like Valiant Warrior and such), and make them all player attachments, or I would make more and more treasures and boons, include them in more products (maybe even each AP comes with a treasure) and devise a way to use them in general, in other quests, and with a requisite (finishing X quest, but then you can use it in the rest of the cycle, or whatever). It's this middle ground of "It's like a player card, but it isn't!" that I hate.

As mentioned Boons are essentially Treasures and I wouldn't like seeing any more Treasure cards, I would much rather have cool attachments and such as real player cards to play in all quests.  A few more Boons are fine as long as they follow what we've seen from the Black Riders- titles and such.  We'll be getting Glamdring and other unique weapons/armor as Boons and that's a bit sad since we can't use those in outside quests but for such specific items I guess they're fine as Boons.

 

Ultimately I want more normal player cards of weapons and armor especially in other spheres! Let's see more Ranger Bow cards!  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Seems I´m in the minority here but I rather like the way that treasure and boons (also burdens for that matter) have been implemented in the game.

It has made the saga expansions much more thematic than would otherwise be possible if you could just drag along everything from them and thus much more enjoyable when I do play those quests.

So on my part I´ll just say to keep up the good work FFG.

I'm with you Nerdmeister, while I too want more more more player cards to open deckbuilding up a bit more etc I really like boons, treasures and burdens which can only be used in the sagas...Makes them more unique and special and adds extra mechanics and elements into the game.

I really don't get the whole call for "no more objectives, boons, burdens etc just give us all player cards". One of the best things about this game to me is being able to chain multiple quests together thematically and mechanically which cards like boons burdens etc do fantastically. Also nothing could be made too powerful or unbalancing if they are simply player cards. If it is a boon it could be ridiculously good (glamdring spoiled in the road darkens is pretty sweet, +2 attack and card draw when you kill orcs for 2 neutral is goddamn awesome) but hard to earn, or you possibly lose it or have a chance to lose it (or even break it!) on your travels or maybe it even has limited uses, or perhaps a limit of one use per quest.

The choices you make for boons and burdens will also allow each campaign play through to be very different, why would people not want this either?

Honestly it seems to be that this is just because of how slow player cards are released with this game in general combined with the delay for the ring maker cycle that is making people say they don't want boons and burdens...

You want boons and burdens you just want more player cards and awesome weapon/armour attachments AS WELL not instead! :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]
