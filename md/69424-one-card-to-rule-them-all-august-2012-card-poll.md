# [One Card to Rule Them All (August 2012 Card Poll)](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69424-one-card-to-rule-them-all-august-2012-card-poll/)

## 1 [RGun on August 19, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69424-one-card-to-rule-them-all-august-2012-card-poll/?do=findComment&comment=676640)

Given the last adventure pack has now been released for the Darrowdelf Cycle I think it's time for a follow-up card poll to the one I ran in March.

The voting will be open until Friday, August 31.  All cards in the Core, Shadows of Mirkwood Cycle, Khazad-dum and Darrowdelf Cycle are included in the pool to choose from (Hobbit is excluded).


I'll compile and publish the results after voting ends, and include a comparison to the results of the last poll. Feel free to respond to as many of the categories as you like. One set of votes per forum participant. Only one card per category. I know some cards only work really well in combination with certain others, but no combos included please.  It will be interesting to see how the results differ from the last poll.

I am a little confused. Wouldn't it make sense to now include all cards from the - now completed - Dwarrowelf Cycle, not just Redhorn Gate? If I had to guess, I would say, you maybe copied that sentence out of that old thread? gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]

1. Most Powerful Player Card - Leadership Sphere - Steward of Gondor (its ability for multiple-turn uses edges out Sneak Attack for me)

2. Most Powerful Player Card - Spirit Sphere - A Test of Will (wanted to pick Arwen here, but since ATOW cancels pretty much eevry card people selected as an answer for #7… lol).

3. Most Powerful Player Card - Lore Sphere - Gildor (again, longevity - and versatility- wins out for me.. although I use Daeron's Runes in more decks)

4. Most Powerful Player Card - Tactics Sphere - Feint

5. Most Powerful Player Card - All Spheres -Steward of Gondor (Vilya was considered, but since no combos allowed…)

6. Most Thematic Card - Legacy of Durin (again with Elrond/Vilya a close second)

7. Nastiest Encounter Card - Sudden Pitfall  (I've survived Sleeping Sentry plenty of times, when SP drops on turn 1 with no allies in play… game over)

8. Best Artwork - Glorfindel (Spirit)

9. Favourite Hero - Theodred (Dain and Glorfindel are close behind)

10. Favourite Quest - Foundations of Stone (the great mix of a muliplayer AND solo feel is just super creative)!

Below are the results of the latest card poll, and also included are the previous results for comparison.  Not a lot of changes from the previous poll, with the cards from the Core set still dominating most of the "power" categories and ones from Darrowdelf the others.  Not that much love for cards from Shadows of Mirkwood.  18 people voted this time around, compared to 10 last time.

The one category that surprised me was Lore - with so many people picking Daeron's Runes.  I get that the card has 0 cost, but all it lets you do is draw 2 cards at the expense of discarding one.  Even though it is 0 cost, you still need to take up a spot in your deck (and hand) with it and then you have to also discard a card.  Seems to me you could replace it with better cards in your deck.

hey first thanks for doing these polls

as for the runes the reason theyre deemed such power cards is that they effectively allow you to build a lower card deck. with this and we have not been idle you can run a 50 card deck that becomes a 44 card deck through the 2 card's mechanics…ie draw one of them and discard it to draw another (or 2) for free

this greatly increases draw chances

Have to chime in on Daeron's Runes.

The reason why they are considered powerful is because they are the very first 100%, auto-include, no-exceptions, play-with-them card (for Lore decks that is).

I have played games without Steward of Gondor, without A Test of Will, but never ever have I played without Daeron's Runes when I had a Lore hero. All other "power" cards have cases where you don't need them, but not so with Daeron's Runes.

Good point, I hadn't considered that aspect of it.  I think I'll start using it more.

I have played games without Steward of Gondor, without A Test of Will, but never ever have I played without Daeron's Runes when I had a Lore hero. All other "power" cards have cases where you don't need them, but not so with Daeron's Runes.



Agree with you. Daerons runes  most powerful card in the game now.

Daeron's Runes is only as powerful as the other cards in your deck.

If all your other cards are weak, pointless cards (I'm looking at you, Bombur!), then Daeron's Runes is just as weak and pointless as those.

So, really, Daeron's Runes is only powerful because there are other cards in your deck that you want to use more.

What I'm wondering is, what Lore cards are you hoping to draw with Daeron's Runes?

 

I'm also wondering if there is going to be a quest that removes from the game cards from your deck and/or discard pile and that force you to lose if your deck is depleted.  That could make Daeron's Runes dangerous to use.

It is great to see different opinions on the quality of cards. A lot comes down to the style of decks you like to build. Personally, I'm not so convinced by Daeron's Runes. It doesn't actually offer card draw (2 cards are replaced with 2 others) so what it really does is offer potential card quality. If you have a duplicate unique in your hand (to discard) then your card quality should increase. If you have built a good deck then your card quality won't necessarily increase. There are times in a game (when your hand is already good for the situation you are in) that I wouldn't play Daeron's Runes. Gleowine always seems useful however!

Imladris Stargazer is similar in role to the runes, it improves card quality in your hand and when combo'd with Master of the Forge becomes really powerful as you gain card draw and the chance to see a lot of your deck very quickly. She also works well with the runes and as such always comes first in the queue for cards to include in my deck, followed by the master of the forge and then the runes.

Erestor is again a similar card to the runes, it is all about card quality, is repeatable and can quest for 2 each round. In a deck with many duplicate uniques and enough resource generation I think Erestor really outshines the runes.

Best Lore card: Master of the Forge.

Daeron's Runes is certainly a great card, and there's little reason not to include it if you're playing Lore, but I don't agree that it's the most *powerful* Lore card. To me, that designation most appropriately applies to the card that does the most to help you win the game when it enters play. Daeron's Runes is terrific because it provides a small benefit with no drawback. There is no opportunity cost; it's just a straight bonus in terms of card quality and deck slimming. But the effect itself is, to me, not particularly *powerful*.

Instead, I look at cards like A Burning Brand and Forest Snare. The former negates an entire dimension of randomness within the game, while the latter is so powerful that virtually all "boss monsters" are designed to counteract it. Neither is prohibitively difficult to play. Those cards, in my mind, are more powerful than Daeron's Runes--not necessarily "better" or more likely to make it into one of my decks, but more significant.

I won't disagree that Burning Brand or Forest Snare are "powerful", but each card can be powerful under certain circumstances, for example Power in the Earth is possibly the most "powerful" card vs. Impassable Bog, yet nobody would vote for Power in the Earth as a powerful card.

What I am trying to say is that I want to assess "power" on a very general level. And there is simply no more general powerful card, than a card that improves 100% of all Lore decks. (Not sure if my point gets through).

Or maybe for some fellow math geeks, in my mind I evaluate the power of cards "relative" aka value/cost. And Daeron's Runes is "dividing by zero" so to say, the value is not as great as other cards, but it is always (and I mean for any deck) useful and completely "free".

(I am no native speaker, so not sure, if everything I said was clear)

 I think it is very clear. And I understand the math. I also really like the card but I don't think I would argue that it improves every Lore-hero deck. I have played it a lot now, and I have been concentrating on its effects very carefully as I had been undecided about its potency from the beginning. And I must say I still am to some extent. I do play it in a deck with Vilya and it often stands in my hand as I don't always want to draw anything, only early in the game mostly, and even then the outcome can prove rather negative. Of course in such a deck with Vilya or Light of Valinor and Asfaloth (Glorfindel present, of course) there are more options to discard but I tend to get a bit paranoid about getting rid of cards.

That said, I still agree, the card is lovely, and I will keep it in the deck for now. But I really don't think it is a silver bullet card.
