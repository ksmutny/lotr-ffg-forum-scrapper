When a "Venom" enemy causes you damage, it says to deal that character one poison.

 

If a character takes 2 damage from the enemy, do they get 2 poison, or just 1 because they were damaged?

 

Embarrassed that I can't figure this out from reading the rules and searches, but all the examples only deal with one damage...

Wow, after reading the rules sheet I think you are actually right and regardless of the amount of damage done they are given a single poison; "When an enemy with the Venom keyword damages a character, that character’s controller must give it 1

poison."

 

I have always played that characters take poison equal to the amount of damage they take from an enemy with the poison keyword. This news definitely makes the quest that little bit easier!!!!

I believe it is one poison card dealt for each case when your character is damaged by an enemy with "Poison", regardless whether it deals your character one or more points of damage.

That's what I was feeling too.

Hi guys. Same subject, slightly different question.

 

If an effect tells you to give a poison to a character you control, can you give it to an unconscious character, or does the recipient have to be conscious?

 

If you can give it to an unconscious character, what happens when they have as many poison as hit points? Do the poison cards get discarded again and they stay unconscious? Do they die?

 

I have to say I find this quest the hardest in terms of rule clarifications. I seem to spend more time checking rules than actually playing!

 

Anyway, thanks in advance!

From the rules insert, and reiterated on the quest cards themselves, it says:

 

"Unconscious characters cannot quest, attack, defend, collect resources, trigger abilities, be poisoned, or ready (except by effects that target unconscious characters)."

Thank you GrandSpleen for pointing out the obvious!

 

I was having a mare yesterday with this quest and couldn't see the words for the writing!!

I must have read that sentence at least 3 or 4 times!

 

Many thanks again. I shall now skulk back to my hovel and thoroughly reprimand myself for wasting your time!

don't beat yourself up, we all have plenty of questions.  I make plenty of mistakes when I'm playing... I do my best to be careful but I just have to accept the occasional bonehead error as an unavoidable part of the game!
