 Hi, everyone,

Read the rules, watched the tutorial and played three rounds, but I have some questions to clear up some things.

1. Once you commit characters to a quest, by default, they cannot defend or attack due to exhaustion from being committed, correct?

2. Once a character has been assigned to defend, by default, this character cannot then attack, because they are exhausted, correct?

3. Because of the above exhaustion factor, it's possible that enemies continue to be assigned to these same exhausted heroes after the combat phase because they not killed?

4. During the refresh, when you reset the heroes, these enemies are automatically assigned to the same characters (from the previous round)? Or can you reassign them?

This games seems like fun, but some things are a little unclear.

Cheers,

DW.

1) Correct (though there are cards to refresh heroes/allies)

2) Correct (again, there are cards to refresh)

3) No. You can only defend once per character. If no one is left to defend, a hero takes the full damage of their attack strength.

4) You can re-assign defenders. They do not attack the same hero/ally (unless you want them too).

Welcome to the boards!

Ironfoot has already answered your queries, but to elaborate further for your own understanding of the rules, feel free to read the below.

1. Once you commit characters to a quest, by default, they cannot defend or attack due to exhaustion from being committed, correct?

 2. Once a character has been assigned to defend, by default, this character cannot then attack, because they are exhausted, correct?

The start of page 14 of the rule book helps explain the above two queries.

...When a card has been “used” for some purpose, such as to commit to a quest, to attack, to defend, or to use a character ability that requires the card to exhaust, it is turned 90 degrees sideways and considered “exhausted.” An exhausted card cannot exhaust again (and therefore cannot partake in any action that requires exhaustion) until it has been readied once more.

 

3. Because of the above exhaustion factor, it's possible that enemies continue to be assigned to these same exhausted heroes after the combat phase because they not killed?

Reading the above it sounds like you might want to re-read page 18 of the rules and pay particular attention to the section that state "If an attack is undefended, all damage from the attack must be assigned to a single hero controlled by the active player." 

 

4. During the refresh, when you reset the heroes, these enemies are automatically assigned to the same characters (from the previous round)? Or can you reassign them?

Each turn during the Combat phase you get the chance to assign defenders to engaged enemies however you like (effectively re-assigning them as you say).

 

Hope that helps.

 Hi, everyone,

Thanks very much. My wife and I are starting to enjoy the game. We have a few more questions:

1. Necromancer's Treachery - does this affect all heroes on the quest, or just the player's heroes who drew the card during the quest phase?

2. Forest Spider: Does it always get a +1 Attack after each engagement? So 1st round engagement, +1, not killed, 2nd round engagement, +1? 

3. If we make 3 progress because of Legolas with Blade of Gondolin, and we are at the location with +1 Progress. The location gets +2 progress, any remaining progress gets applied to the quest, yes?

Thanks!

1)  Necromancer's Treachery affects all heroes on the quest because technically no player is drawing the encounter cards, they are put into play.

2)  The Forest Spider only gets his +1 when he initially engages a player.  Once a player has or is forced to engage with a monster that is the only time they are engaged.  So the Forest Spider only gets his +1 the first time he attacks.  However, if a card changes his engagement (e.g. Son of Arnor to change who the Spider is engaged with) that is a whole new engagement and would therefore grant the Spider the +1 again.

3)  Any progress tokens that go above and beyond what the location requires to be removed from play go on the quest.

 

I'm incredibly glad you are enjoying the game.  The rules aren't the clearest on earth but there is a great game there once you get these minor questions answered.

efidm is right, acccording to the rules "After each player has had the opportunity to commit characters to the quest, the encounter deck reveals one card per player". Creepy, cards revealing themselves from the deck... happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]

I'm assuming (and can be wrong doing it) that this "Necromancer's Treachery" is in fact the "The Necromancer's Reach" treachery card.

If I'm right then the effect of the card is: "When Revealed: Deal 1 damage to each exhausted character". So all exhausted characters are effected, even allies and even characters who are exhausted but not commited to the quest.

If I'm wrong, please provide the text of the card.
