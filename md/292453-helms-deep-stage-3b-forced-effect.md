I’ve been playing Helms Deep as I continue through the sagas.  I have a question regarding the timing of the forced effect of 3B which says

 


Forced: After resolving the quest, 
if the encounter deck did not place at least 1 progress on this stage as the result of questing, 
the first player reveals 1 encounter card.

 

Occasionally I get to stage 3 as a result of the encounter deck applying enough progress during the quest phase to clear stage 2.  So during quest resolution stage 2 is replaced by stage 3.  Are we thus “at the end of quest resolution” such that the now present forced effect on 3B triggers?

The forced effect is intended to trigger only when questing at that stage.

Thanks!  I need to get better at my search queries.

I've been playing it by the ruling then.
