With Caleb's pre-announcement about some upcoming big news what do folks think it is? I think next cycle is most likely, but what are the other realistic possibilities?  

-Revised Core (like Netrunner recently got)

-2nd edition (like GoT)

-Some kind of new licensing agreement that allows them access to other periods (.e. First Age)

I can't really think of any other possibilities that seem likely.....any other ideas?

## 2 [Bullroarer Took on November 14, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/263203-big-news/?do=findComment&comment=3079039)

While I think it will be the next deluxe, it could be Scouring.

## 3 [Trialus on November 14, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/263203-big-news/?do=findComment&comment=3079077)

Scouring would be cool...

## 4 [dalestephenson on November 14, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/263203-big-news/?do=findComment&comment=3079081)

An outside possibility would be a "campaign mode" providing boons/burdens for past cycles.

...but that would be even cooler!

 

Edit:. Though after thinking about more, that seems like the kind of thing that would be done to kinda put a bow on the whole line once new content was done being created.

I wouldn't ordinarily consider announcement of the next cycle to be "big news", though after the long drought we've had the availability of the 5th AP might qualify as big news.

## 7 [Rouxxor on November 14, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/263203-big-news/?do=findComment&comment=3079134)

As I say on the other topics:

It could be another product to fill the space of the deluxe, thing that happens outside the cycle. It could be idea about organized play (either new specific content, rules to replace face the shadow or something totally different).

But I'm pretty confident that is about the next cycle.

## 8 [Gizlivadi on November 14, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/263203-big-news/?do=findComment&comment=3079254)

I wonder if Caleb is regretting teasing these news and building up so much hype and crazy ideas when the news is just going to be the next AP is shipping.

As long as we're wildly speculating, the new FFG Interactive studio is announcing its first game "before the end of the year" according to its studio head. (See interview on Rock Paper Shotgun.) Not betting my house on it being LOTR, but I guess it's an outside possibility that the timing isn't coincidental...

## 11 [Thanatopsis on November 15, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/263203-big-news/?do=findComment&comment=3080577)

FFG has been doing a lot of unprecedented things with their card games lately:

1) Netrunner: revised core with rotation
2) Destiny: overhaul of their organized play
3) Akham Horror: releasing alternative art cards in novellas
4) Destiny: a willingness to errata the cost of cards and change fundamental game rules
5) L5R: releasing an entire cycle in six weeks

It just makes sense that they would do something to similar to revitalize LotR. Now, I don't mean v2.0. But, recent events would lead me to believe it's not just an announcement for a new cycle coming in December.

Did you folks see Amazon is looking at making a TV show for Lotr. Takes places between the hobbit and fellowship it sounded like. Maybe it will be a tie in to that?

## 14 [GrandSpleen on November 15, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/263203-big-news/?do=findComment&comment=3080725)

Saw a news story today that Christopher Tolkien has resigned as Tolkien Estate Director (happened back in August, but the news just broke today, or at least I'm only just seeing it).

This would open up negotiations for licensing of properties that he has long protected, like The Silmarillion.

It's already resulted in a new Middle-Earth TV series on Amazon.

So.... about that announcement?

## 15 [Rouxxor on November 15, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/263203-big-news/?do=findComment&comment=3080911)

Maybe the just-released FAQ is tying up the loose ends to wrap up Version 1.  And with 17 pages of FAQs and errata it would help make the case for Version 2.

## 21 [Authraw on November 16, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/263203-big-news/?do=findComment&comment=3081944)

I don't think you would wrap up V1 of your game by dropping a bombshell of an FAQ on it and then walking away. You only do something that has this much potential to be unpopular if you are planning to keep developing for it, and you felt it was necessary to keep your design space open.

I'd love it if they'd announce a full-fledged computer version. 

Of course, that's not really their "thing", but a computer version would address the main challenges for those of us who are collecting the cards without actually playing the game:

1) it would know all the rules and prevent us from breaking them

2) it would save our state within a game, so that we can easily handle interruptions

3) we could play the game anywhere that we bring that computer/device  (no table needed)

4) it would track our progress through the scenarios

5) it could provide analytics and possibly even card recommendations

## 29 [tripecac on December 3, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/263203-big-news/?do=findComment&comment=3107513)

If I recall, one of the perceived "hurdles" for making a computer version of LotR LCG was licensing, right? 

Could the stepping down of Christopher Tolkien have made licensing easier, and therefore made a computer version more economically feasible?

Or... if it's not a computer version that's announced, do you think it will be Silmarillion content?  That would be a bit of a disappointment IMO.  Imagine slogging through the entire History of Middle Earth....  Scenario after scenario after scenario....

An App based Campaign-Mode for the cardgame would be awesome. I really like how the did it with Descent. For me it would be a hughe disappointment if they just do a computer-version of the game. I want new geek-stuff for playing with my mades and wife. Something to keep the game alive in my rounds.

That's been bandied about.  I would love to have that, but I fear we are only going to get one or the other.  So I would like to keep the co-op for a while longer.

I have been thinking for a while now that it seems like they are waiting for the big news until the current cycle is all released - if that is true, it might well be something that will put some sort of end to the current version of the game. In other words, that will be some new beginning of some sort...

I really cannot imagine that it is "just" a new cycle being announced. Then, there would have been no reason to wait so long with the announcement

Yeah, slowly developing card pools were a common complaint from Thrones and other games so FFG took the opportunity to try to do something about it. They did it for Arkham as well by making the first non-core product an expansion (which would have been my preferred solution for L5R).

Hmm - I guess I might have been wrong about the "waiting until everything is released?

From Beorn's website [https://hallofbeorn.wordpress.com/2017/12/07/escape-from-the-dungeons-of-cirith-gurat/] " We know that there will be a “big announcement” from FFG about the game on Saturday, and we all wait with bated breathe to see what the future holds."

Hmm. I do not like this attempt to sell games. For me, it feels like they published a beta version of the game for the full price and then you have to purchase even more content to get it running.

Ok, with a LCG or TCG this _is_ the concept. But when having a "core game" then - ihmo - it should run on its own. And they make some greater pause between the base game and each cycle...

Instead, they should've focused on these other brands of theirs. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] rant over. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

The interesting thing though is that in that article it actually says "The Lord of the Rings announcement!"  It doesn't actually have 'The Card Game'. That could be an oversight or it could mean something besides the card game is going to be introduced. I think it would be interesting to see a reboot of Middle-Earth Quest done like Mansions of Madness with a program to run the narrative and encounters.

The more I think about this "big announcement" the more I m pretty sure it will be a digital version of LOTR LCG.

I don't know if it s the first time, but the use of Twitch for broadcasting the announce isn t neutral. A digital platform for a digital version makes some sense.

Lastly, I don 't  know if anyone reads this RPS article, but the last paragraph ends to convince me.

https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2017/11/03/fantasy-flight-digital-interview/ [https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2017/11/03/fantasy-flight-digital-interview/]

RPS: When can we expect to see the first game come out of the new studio?

Tim: Very soon, actually. We will make an announcement before the end of the year as to our first game and it will be released early in 2018.

 

It s perfectly fitting ??

I hope there will be new contents , for instance a campaign mode for every cycle. ? Or new version of old cards, for example Spirit Pippin, or Bilbo Hero...

I think my good friend Valiko is right. As much as that bogs me down, it has to be a digital version.

I do hope that they make the app/soft support the physical card game too. You could play with your actual cards while the app would manage the campaign aspects, with, YAY!!!, a generic campaign mode.

That campaign mode could very well give you some kind of "money/credits" to "buy" equipment, new allies, etc. I don't think It would be that hard to balance with a companion app, and other 7 years, I've seen so many attempts at doing that kind of campaign mode. Heck, all those progression modes are nearly that, aren't they? You could auto-win some cards as you progress, and spend credits/experience/whatever to get the "most powerful ones".

What always dissuaded me from doing a progression-style thing (and that is why we opted to make our own campaign mode [https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1214867/tale-years-mega-campaign-mode-lotr-lcg] with friends) is that the physical card pool management is not as easy IRL as playing on OCTGN. An app would help that. Remember which cards you purchased and which you did not, etc.

EDIT: also European readers, the twitch of FFG is announced 11AM CT, that's 6 PM on the continent and 5 PM in the UK.

I can't refute the logic of this idea, but am pretty sure that I would still just stick to my physical cards.  Wouldn't really be psyched to put any money into a digital version after the hundreds of dollars I've invested in the physical cards.  Not to mention the whole "I play card games when i don't want to play video games" piece. 

If true, I'm sure there is a way to do it that draws in new players and pleases established players as well without resorting to the slimy practices that have been plagueing video games of late, but don't know if it'll be for me.  

Edit after seeing a few of the other recent posts made while I typed...some sort of companion app/campaign mode would be really cool.  Like that much better than a straight digital version of LOTR LCG.

Digital card games usually cost far less than physical ones, so it is not like you'll need to spend the same amout of money to play digital.

 

As a person with very little time due to day job, the things about digital card game that I can appreciate is full automation and quickness of the tideous irl activities I must perform, like if I want to change my deck, I'll need to sit swapping cards for some time. And I can't have several decks that share same card available at the same time irl, I can in digital card game. Shuffling: quality skyrockets, time drops to 0. As an additional benefit - I would be able to play with people who live away. 

 

Don't kid yourself or anybody else here, all that digital version brings is benefits, and it trumps any companion app possible, because companion app would be just one additional tideous process to perform while playing irl.

I think most of my LCG playtime is taking out and putting back my cards in the binder.

Then, there's the time I think and talk about the game.

That must leave 5% at actually playing the **** game.

Eh, I hope it isn't a digital version. I definitely won't be investing the time and money into a digital version when I've already purchased everything physically. Also, playing with physical cards with real friends is much more appealing to me than pairing up with people I don't know online.

I would like a digital version very much. I often play solo and a digital version is great for that! Plus: Deck building is much easier. But I agree cards win out easily once you play with  friends.

Also: Don't all FFG Products have this little white square with a proof of purchase code? So they could offer a way to transfer your physical collection to a digital.

So, what are you hoping for then? We already got new cycle announced. And, while we're at it, what is stopping ya from pairing up online with real friends? xD

I don't have any expectations for the announcement. If the game died after the next cycle I'd still be happy as I find most of the quests to have high replayability. Also there are plenty of player cards that I haven't had a chance to use yet. Nothing is stopping me from pairing online with real friends, I just find it less fun than hanging out in person.

I have nothing against a digital version if it comes out - it's just not going to be for me.

By the way, the design look a bit ugly and the gameplay offers nothing for more than others virtuals card games.

Each card has a level (1, 2 or 3 presumably) and you can only include a level 1 leadership card in your deck if you have at least 1 leadership hero.  If you want to include a level 2 card, you need at least 2 leadership heroes.  Once you start playing, though, you can apparently pay for cards from whichever resources you have available.

Ok. I watched it. Not much was said or shown, so my thoughts gonna be few as well.

 

First: Current visuals look awful, I sincerely hope they do something with it before the release, as I've already said, aesthetic is a very important part of any card game, and current aesthetic of the game is severly lacking.

As for change in the resource system, I think it is interesting, and not particularly good or bad. It presents with more deckbuilding freedom and opportunities, while also reducing the need to fiddle with the resources. Some people will like it, some people might hate it. I can see the good and interesting in both of them.

The system where enemies and characters damage each other simultaneously I am not sure about, because I currently don't know how this gonna work exactly. There is many different ways this can be done.

Random - I am always against random. Caleb announced that Sneak Attack now summons a random ally instead of somebody from your hand. I don't like it. But then again, this is a co-op card game, so random might be not that severe here.

Encounter deck being an acutal AI controlled player with options and resource I consider a strong GOOD change for one simple reason - how many times you had to forfiet the game turn 1? Exactly, game has no way of controlling the high roll unwinnable turn 1 situations. But with this change, encounter deck might now play in a growing curve, achieving what we have always wanted - easier start, tougher mid to endgame.

Economy model - digital LCG is good. Pay for what you want, not for bunch of random stuff. Nuff said.

Well, if you take out all the shuffling, setupping, and all other manual labor you need to perform - game of LotR LCG can indeed be very quick, especially when you don't ponder on each decision. If you ponder, however, even digital game can take ages. For example, each Mansions of Madness 2 scenario has estimated playtime, and me and my playgroup always exceed it at least 2 times. Human factor.

## 89 [Seastan on December 9, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/263203-big-news/?do=findComment&comment=3117810)

If you take this card game and remove the need to control the encounter deck or pause every 10 seconds to scan all the cards for possible triggers, it would naturally be a lot shorter.

But beyond that it looks like they've stripped most of the phases out of the game as well, with just two phases, "Planning" and "Adventure". Not sure how I feel about that but I will reserve judgement until I get to play. The two games might end up fulfilling different gaming needs for me, especially if this eventually comes to mobile.

There are a lot more information now, and I am very concerned with the concept of "favor" cards:

The Lord of the Rings: Living Card Game also introduces Favor cards, powerful expendable cards that “burn” or disappear forever after a single use. After a player resolves their initial mulligan, they’ll receive a prompt asking if they want to use one of their Favor cards during that Quest. If so, that card will be added to their hand. Favor cards generally provide some kind of advantage that the players can’t get elsewhere—it’s a way to tip the scales against Sauron.

 

Selling power, or in other words, "pay to win" is never, never a good decision, even in a co-op/solo game.

Wow, this "big news" means nothing to me -- my wallet stays happy. Would be very bummed if new cycle hadn't just been announced.

Though I find it most odd that the app has the same title as the physical game, when they are obviously so different. That's unnecessarily confusing for newbies to either game.

I agree 100%. This is a huge red flag. They could easily release quests that are nearly impossible to beat without using the favor cards.

It took a moment, but the big disappointement, that it's not "just" a digital version of the game is gone now (really would have loved an "offical OCTGN Version" with less "rough edges"). It just reads like a different game that I can look forward to and hope ends up great. 

Even though I hope for the best, there are more negative points for me at the moment than positive:

1. As John said, the screenshots are just ugly. Really the first thing that came thorugh my mind was "urgh". From the card layouts over the buttons to the backround, everything looks "cheap", like it was done in a hurry. Even the card artworks somehow look bad, even though they are the same as the physical version... There are so many great location artworks and it looks that they are substituted by at least second class 3D animations. I could go on, but this really has to improve or it will be hard to enjoy. Hopeully it looks better in motion.

2. Everything about the gameplay has to wait until there is at least a recorded match to see the changes in action. 

3. Randomness. Oh god why. The change to sneak attack (now simply summoning ANY random ally) doesn't feel good to me. I play Hearthstone and can live with the use of randomness there. But it was there all along. I know the lotr LCG works wihout extra randomness and now it gets added. I know the ups and downs of random effects and see why they can be fun, but I will always prefer to have as less as possible. 
Also the theme of giving you the feeling of laying out a trap for the opponent is gone and now it's just this "Deus ex machine" feeling, that you know that "Someone" will appear to hopefully save the day.
Adding to this: Sneak attack havin this new effect means it can't have it's old one. Meaning the effect will be completely gone, because why create a new card for an existing effect, when you can just use the ols one. I fear this could be a sign of reduced interaction via events during the "adventuring" phase, focusing on "minion smashing" :S 

4. AI. A double edged sword. If the AI is weak the game will crash and burn. Noone wants to play against a dumb AI. But as they say that threat is still in the game I think this will "somehow" influence which cards the AI can play agains you making it relative for it to play the "strongest cards". Silly combat decisions will be a blowout too. Tasking an AI with all the decisions we did outselfs for so many years is dangerous an for me it was a very fun part "in multiplayer" to figure out how to distribute the enemies. Sad to see this go :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

5. This being a f2p-game is no surprise and I can live with it, as there enough ways to keep the game accessable without money, while offering incentive to invest some, if you can afford it. Obviously we have to wait for the prices.

6. But now the most important point for me: Caleb works on the game. No matter when I see or hear something from him, he always seems so full of passion for the game and Lotr in general and I can't imagine him advising or implementing (not sure how big his role in the development of the digital version is) a change he doesn't feel good about. So even with all the questionsmarks above, I still have hope that the final product will be great once I get to play it.

If I can play a game in ten minutes in an off moment fine.  If I can keep playing my beloved LOTR LCG great.  If the designer for both is the same person... I'm worried.

## 96 [John Constantine on December 10, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/263203-big-news/?do=findComment&comment=3118432)

Yeah, I mentioned randomness in my prev post, but now I want to pay a little bit more attention to it.

As someone who spent loads of free time doing custom cards and reworks for LotR LCG, LotR LCG-related modifications (Innistrad MTG, Call of Cthulhu before Arkham LCG was announced), I simply don't understand Caleb's excitement with his ability to do random effect thanks to the digitalness of the game. I mean, digitalness of the game allows for TONS of cool stuff to be done, not just random... but to take a perfectly fine and iconic original card that had a cool effect that involved deckbuilding (ok, who am I kidding, it involved including neutral Gandalf into your deck, but still), and just water it down to a button with "random" on it? That seems like a very poor use of digital potential to me. If digital Sneak Attack stays that way, then I predict that people will stop using it as soon as card pool grows and decks can be filled with cards that player can predict and control. Imagine if they change Gandalf from choose to random? Man, this is not how use the random effect to the game's advantage.

If the phases have been simplified out of existence, Sneak Attack with a chosen ally would be much more powerful than it is in the real game, where the sneak contribution is limited to one phase.

Yes, that Keen-eyed Took will be a huge contributor throughout the entire adventure phase.

## 99 [dalestephenson on December 10, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/263203-big-news/?do=findComment&comment=3118606)

Sneak Attack is most commonly used with core Gandalf, and in a simplified no-phase game a sneaked core Gandalf is exactly as much good as a full-price Gandalf, with the bonus that he stays in your hand at the end of the turn.  Sneak Attack is already a leadership staple, making it dramatically better by removing its one restriction (single phase) would indeed be overpowered.

So instead it becomes pot-luck like Imrahil.  You might get Gandalf, but you also might get Keen-eyed Took.  It's not our sneak attack, but it may end up being a Really Useful Card all the same.

He isn't unless you bring readying effects. On my dare I say rich digital card gaming experience, cards with uncontrollable unrestricted random never become staples, and are meme-tier at best. Which this one will end up as, unless changed.

After a player resolves their initial mulligan, they’ll receive a prompt asking if they want to use one of their Favor cards during that Quest. If so, that card will be added to their hand. Favor cards generally provide some kind of advantage that the players can’t get elsewhere—it’s a way to tip the scales against Sauron.

I personally still hope we won’t have to pay for Favor cards. They may be one-use only in a way some boons are right now, and ffg will get their money from players buying normal cards. I hate buying something to play it only once, so I hope it’s as I say. I don’t mind paying some money for additional Hero packs if the game is fun to play, though.

Well, the cards "burn" or dissapear forever after a single use, how else you are gonna replenish them if not by buying?

My bet is that these Favor cards are gonna be sold for both regular and premium currencies.

Worst case scenario that I can see: Quests are balanced around using those Favor cards, making runs without Favor cards very unfavorable (pun intended), making them literal pay to win.

Best case scenario that I can see: Quests are balanced completely without Favor cards in mind, making them just a tool for newer players to gain an edge, or for seasoned players to render a quest harmless.
