Just for confirmation or correction. I'm playing Journey along the Anduin and the first card I reveal is Pursued by Shadow. Each player raises their threat by 1 for each character not currently committed to a quest.

Am I correct in presuming this means I just raise my threat by 3 sins I haven't done anything yet? Or am I that lucky to just ignore it and then continue (as if you are that lucky in this quest ;P)

If I get any treachery cards during the setup phase I just discard them.

Would like some clarification also as to whether this is correct.

This is also how I have been playing.  You reveal cards just as you would during the questing phase and resolve their effects

Yeah, I think raising each players threat is the correct options.

Quotin from the FAQ: "'When Revealed' effects are resolved if the cards are revealed during setup."

That's the way I understand and play it...

I believe I got Pursued by Shadow four times in my recent six play rotation of HFG, each time during setup. First game I think was three Treacheries among the first four cards. Old Wives' Tales during setup can really kill you. PbS + Flooding + Massing at Night + 2 more cards could be a very nasty setup.

Treacheries during setup - you just gotta love them! ;-)

I remember asking this question a while back, and the consensus was the same. You are stuck with it, whenever it comes out. Imagine having a starting threat of 27-28, this card shows up and now you got the Hill Troll on the first turn. If you don't happen to have Sneak Attack and Gandalf on hand, as an emergency measure, you are in a heap of trouble. The only positive is that there is one less card in staging waiting to cause trouble.

This was exactly my situation :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] threat 28 to begin with, Pursued by Shadows = threat 31, HELLO HILL TROLL! Game over :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]
