How many costs is Citadel Custodian if it goes into play with A Vey Good Tale? Five or it counts his hability -four or less-?

I would say you count it as 5. His ability says to give a discount to play him for each Gondor ally in play. With A Very Good Tale you do not play him but rather put him into play.

agree, I'd always use the printed cost.  When he's in the discard pile his text isn't changing his cost, anyway.

Obviously, the custodian is better at telling a tale, rather then being part of it.
