Yes i hope waiting will end soon. I wondering about something now , in the LOTR products section Shadows of Mirkwood cycle,says that contains 3 products,The Hunt for Gollum,Conflict at the Carrock, A Journey to Rhosgobel. Maybe i missed something but anyone know if they show up all together or 1 by 1 ? and if so, which adventure pack will be first? beso.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/beso.gif]

Each pack will be released.  Its on the news posted by FFG about the packs.  This is similar to the Warcraft CCG and the Battlepacks.  I believe every month there was a new release.  The Shadows of Mirkwood is the first expansion cycle of the LoTR CCG and I can't wait.  I really like the game so far (last quest is really difficult though)

 Wow, FFG is now teasing that they will give us more teasers next week! 

I can't tell if they are stalling for time because Hunt For Gollum is still at the printers or if this is just a brilliant marketing strategy

Once the cycle gets started we will see regular previews for it as each pack comes and goes. Just like GoT.

Given that the game is sold out in most places and most of us are frothing at the mouth for more cards, I think this is their way of saying, "Hey, no, really we haven't forgotten about you!"

Yeah, dying for news on the adventure packs....Only the adventure packs themselves is what I long for more at the moment lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif]

It's amazing how well the game sold. I wonder, though...many people probably bought the game because of the lotr theme, this being their first lcg. So I wonder how many players will actually keep buying the packs...

I posted the following thread about a week or so ago, naming all six of the "Shadows of Mirkwood" line here [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=480336]. I believe there was an earlier thread doing the same before mine, couldn't find it mind. I also did a thread here [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=480369] about the storyline of the first quest set from the Tolkien novels. Note there are spoilers if you haven't read the books before (as there would be).

I have played a CCG game before this one, quite a while ago (the Decipher Star Wars one) but really got disillusioned with the expense of the game, especially trying to get a complete set including rares. After about the third set I dropped out. I had other things to spend my money on. I have two big Sci-Fi/Fantasy hobbies - Star Wars and LOTR - so when I saw this set (very late tbh) I knew I'd buy into it, especially since there are no rares, just complete sets. The co-operative side to the game is a big like, but the other plus side is the solo play - that sealed the deal.

I can't wait for the next expansion really, hunting down Gollum, that is really really cool, especially with the fact it's something from the books.  

This is going to be a good year for LOTR fans - not only do we have this card game - there will be a RPG by Cubicle 7 called "The One Ring" and there is a Heroclix collection upcoming later this year from Wizkids. Life is good, if you are from Middle Earth lol.

 I spent too much money on Star Wars CCG. Looking back, making some of the rare cards 1 in every 121 rares is total madness. Compared to that, forking over 30-40 dollars for a second or third copy of the core set is highly reasonable.  And I doubt that FFG is losing money by making their product non-random. In hindsight, mystery boosters just seem greedy.

Amazon is showing preorder and relesae date of June 30, 2011.  Bummer, I thought the first AP was due out end of this month!

It should be as the normal structure of releases is 1 per month. With usually a one month break in between each cycle and the occasional large expansion added in. But there was a big delay with the break between the Brotherhood with Banners and Secrets of Oldtown expansions ending and starting for Game of Thrones due to some issue on the printers end so it might have effected LotR as well maybe. Or, Amazon is just wrong. Which would also not surprise me.

In my experience, Amazon tends to be conservative with their release dates for the LCG.  I've been able to get packs from my FLGS weeks  before they were "officially available" on Amazon.

Unfortunately, Hunt for Gollum is still listed as "At the printers" on the Upcoming Products page.  I'm not sure how long a game has to "be on the boat" but I think it is 4-6 weeks and we haven't even gotten that far yet!

It could just be an oversight, it has been at the printers for two months now. fingers crossed.

They print the entire cycle at the same time.
