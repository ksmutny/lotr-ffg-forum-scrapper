This is a funny question: which is the best way to put into game 2 northern trackers first round, at start of quest phase? How would you think?

## 2 [gandalfDK on February 8, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/134384-quiz/?do=findComment&comment=1440416)

So, after planning is over two northern Trackers?

 

Attach a Elf-stone to a location with 1 quest point and sneak attack a Northern Tracker in play.

## 3 [Mndela on February 8, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/134384-quiz/?do=findComment&comment=1440420)

At first round there usually isn't active location to attach elf-stone, but ok.

More ideas? ^^

Which is the best and faster way?

## 4 [Raven1015 on February 8, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/134384-quiz/?do=findComment&comment=1440427)

If you could get 2 into your discard that early, then bring them out with Caldara. Maybe discard 1 with Eowyn and get another in there with Emery? That'd be pretty lucky though.

Some scenarios have them, though.

 

The best and fastest way could be: Vilya 1 into play and sneak attack?

Well, two copies of Timely Aid while in Secrecy would be ideal.

I just put together a new secrecy deck with Sam, Glorfindel, and Pippin.  It could at least get 1 Timely Aid on the first turn for a northern tracker.  Leaf brooch could allow a second.

Ops, true. When i made this post i was thinking about the Raven1015's answer (Caldara + Eowyn + Emery or Zigil), but secrecy +2 Timely Aid seems faster and easier. Yes, good...

## 9 [GrandSpleen on February 9, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/134384-quiz/?do=findComment&comment=1440731)

To increase your chances, 3x Timely Aid and then 3x A Very Good Tale.  In a perfect scenario you could play 2 Timely Aids as long as you had 2 Leadership resources and Secrecy.  Or, 1 Timely Aid that hopefully gets 1 Tracker into play, then play a 1 or 2-cost ally and A Very Good Tale with the Tracker and that other ally to get another Tracker into play.

## 10 [Teamjimby on February 9, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/134384-quiz/?do=findComment&comment=1440801)

Yeah, a secrecy deck with Sam can get an easy first turn Very Good Tale.  Bill the Pony and Rivendell Scout can be played for free, then Very Good Tale and you have a free 4 cost ally.  Timely aid for another one.

## 11 [GrandSpleen on February 9, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/134384-quiz/?do=findComment&comment=1440838)

And in that scenario, both Trackers are ready to participate in the first quest phase!

## 12 [Glaurung on February 9, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/134384-quiz/?do=findComment&comment=1440892)

Hnmmm sound good. Here we start talking about some serious combos.

## 13 [entMoot on February 9, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/134384-quiz/?do=findComment&comment=1441018)

You could also shoot for something less secrecy-oriented like playing 3 Legacy of Numenor with a hero set of Glorfindel (Spirit), Elrond, and Sam (leadership for access to Legacy). I say Elrond because he both is able to play the spirit allies as well as give you lore to play Daeron's Runes and Deep Knowledge to have any hope of seeing the Legacies and Trackers in that first hand.

## 14 [alogos on February 9, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/134384-quiz/?do=findComment&comment=1441245)

Very Good Tale, with some Emery and Rivendell Scout (well, maybe not Emery with all those Leadership cards, but fair enough if you aim for hiden cache) / Timely Aid.

## 15 [13nrv on February 9, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/134384-quiz/?do=findComment&comment=1441513)

I have already put into play two nothern tracker at the quest phase with a secrecy deck (Sam/Galadriel).

Timely aid + very good tale.

 

With this deck, i have put in game 7 allies turn one just after declaring questers.

## 16 [monkeyrama on February 9, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/134384-quiz/?do=findComment&comment=1441608)

Man, now I want to go build a Sam-centred secrecy deck that churns out allies using Timely Aid, A Very Good Tale, and free secrecy allies! Like Glaurung said, this is some good chat! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

## 17 [Mndela on February 9, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/134384-quiz/?do=findComment&comment=1441609)

Timely Aid + Very Good Tale + Good Meal (on Sam)/Strengh of Arms   ^^

## 18 [Teamjimby on February 9, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/134384-quiz/?do=findComment&comment=1441746)

If you are looking for a Sam secrecy deck idea, I just posted one.  Haven't actually played it yet, but I'd love to get some feedback.

I also previously made a Sam/Hirluin Outlands Secrecy deck, but I haven't played it much lately because Outlands are boring.

With Galadriel and Sam, we can maintain the threat below the 20 and so the secrecy during game.
With Nenya, we can play some secrecy cards from lore.
Rivendell scout and Bill the poney are free.
Celduin traveller cost one ressources as Ithilien lookout (if Nenya in play).
For one ressource with timely aids, i put an ally.

So I have at least two allies in first turn (with a very bad hand). Three or four ally is more frequent.
Frequently, i have one or two big ally in play turn one (like northern tracker and sometime two northen tracker)

Then i can commit Sam to the quest and the allies.
With Galadriel, the allies wasn't exhausted so i can play a very good tale and put 2 other allies in play.

The below deck is just crazy. I put in play a lot of ally very quickly.
With a low threat, i control the ennemy engagement and when i engage an enemy Sam is always readied and boost in defense with hobbit cloak.

List :

Sam
Galadriel

Allies :

3x Bill the poney
3x Rivendell scout
3x Celduin traveller
3x Ithilien lookout
3x Envoy of Pelargir
3x Northern Tracker
2x Galadriel maiden
1x Arwen
1x Haldir of Lorien
1x Gildor Inglorien
1x Gimli
1x Legolas
1x Elfhelm
1x Treebeard

Attachments :

3x Nenya
3x Resourcefull
3x Steward of Gondor
2x Hobbit cloak

Event :

3x A very good tale
3x Timely aid
3x Test of will
3x Elrond council

This deck have successfully win against some nightmare scenario from cycle 1, Into the deep, the seventh level, the shadow and the flame, Peril in Pelargir, The morgul vale, Ford of Isen, Dunland trap, the anltered crown, Stone of Erech and Massing at Osgiliath.

Nice.  I figured this deck has been done before.  What changes would you make with all the new secrecy cards?

Is "Pelargir emissary" supposed to be Envoy of Pelargir? And who is Sylvebarbe?

## 23 [13nrv on February 10, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/134384-quiz/?do=findComment&comment=1442894)

Sorry, i'm french ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

I have forgotten to translate some cards.

 

You're right for envoy of Pelargir and Sylvebarbe (french name) is Treebeard.

13nrv, part of me really wanted you to make up a story about the different card names, and act like they were exclusive player cards that most people haven't heard of.

"What, you don't use Pelargir Emissary in your decks? It's one of the best cards, and it has that great combo with Sylvebarbe and François Tracker."

The changes that I made for the new cycle are fairly minimal and mostly involve new allies. I added a copy of Ithilien Lookout, Boromir (who is amazing in this deck), Wandering Ent and Treebeard. The basic engine of the deck remains the same. Use Secrecy cards in the early game to muster as many allies as quickly as you can. Pippin, Gleowine and Daeron's Runes provide card drawing, while Resourceful and Steward of Gondor provide resource acceleration. I also added 1 copy Protector of Lorien and Hobbit Cloak for Sam. Lastly one copy of Stand and Fight gives me another means for getting a Tactics ally into play (since none of the heroes have that sphere). I have posted the full deck list on the Grey Company Podcast Facebook page, but if you need me to I can track it down and repost it here.

Heh, 13nrv doesn't pop up in here often, but when he does he always brings some good deck ideas or combos with him.

You should post your finds more often mate!

Your story doesn't matter for me.

 

I have done all corrections needed after the fair question from joezim007.
