Hollywood, CA–At a press conference today outside his estate in Beverly Hills, acclaimed director Peter Jackson announced his plans to make a 72-film adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien’s The Silmarillion. “It was the next logical step after doing Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit,” Jackson said. “In Lord of the Rings, we took over a thousand pages of novel and adapted it to the big screen in three extremely long films. Then in The Hobbit, we took a children’s book a fraction the length of Lord of the Rings, and also made it into three extremely long films.”

Jackson then unfolded his plan for Tolkien’s The Silmarillion, which begins with a mythological account of the creation of Middle Earth and culminates in the great battles of the Elves during the First Age. “The first film in the series is set to come out in Summer 2016. Then, every two years from 2018 to 2160, the following installment will be released.”

Returning to the original cinematic backgrounds of the Lord of the Rings movies, Jackson made an executive decision to save costs for shooting the outdoor scenes, and had his studio purchase the entire island of New Zealand. “In the long run it will cost us a lot less. Plus, now the citizens of New Zealand are the property of our studio, so we get free labor to build sets.”

Movie buffs and Tolkien nerds alike are ecstatic over the news, and Jackson, as usual, is enjoying the attention, teasing them about the contents of some of the 72 movies they can look forward to. “16 of the movies will be almost exclusively footage of the elven-folk doing various dances, and I don’t want to say much, but The Silmarillion: Part 49 is subtitled Gandalf Smokes his Pipe.”

Hey, 1+ one every two years from 2018 to 2060 makes 23 movies! Where are the other 49???

 

(maybe PJ will explain this mystery in some easter egg on a forthcoming "limited collectors' edition with spoilers" boxset of the Lord of the Hobbits?)

There are a few issues I have with PJ namely Gandolf getting beaten by the witch king

I do think however I would love to see the rise and fall of numenor. Imagine all they could do with that?

The first the rise ending in ***** slapping Sauron the middle the corruption which would be epic if their was a good actor corrupting them and then the last the fall ending in Battle of the gladden fields

Epic

Maybe then Gondolin......

The year was 2160, not 2060. That gives him another hundred years.

Maybe it is because i want it so much, that i cannot believe it, but it looks fake to me

:mellow: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_mellow.png] ...............

 

 

Noooooo.....I think its real!  Didn't you know Peter Jackson bought New Zealand?  I think he's going for Australia next and eventually Indonesia.  Its a pretty good idea to buy those country's......you'd make some nice profits from it, you know what i'm saying?  

## 8 [Glaurung on October 23, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125508-breaking-news/?do=findComment&comment=1308788)

Sounds like a fake!

## 9 [Khamul The Easterling on October 23, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125508-breaking-news/?do=findComment&comment=1308792)

No, its real.  It says so that they are going to do it.  I don't think they are playing possum.

Do you really think its fake?  I'm shocked.....this is unbelievable!  Wow..... You're real good at getting to the bottom of things. Man I just can't believe it.  Thanks guys.

Peter Jackson cannot PLAN to make movies from the Silmarillion for the next 146 years. That in itself makes it pretty obvious it's fake. They made it so glaringly obvious that it is fake.

 



> “16 of the movies will be almost exclusively footage of the elven-folk doing various dances, and I don’t want to say much, but The Silmarillion: Part 49 is subtitled Gandalf Smokes his Pipe.”

 

That'd be ridiculous... and I mean the actual meaning of the word: worthy of ridicule. You also don't get free labor from the people that live on an island that you bought... even if you COULD buy it. The article is entirely meant to make fun of the fact that the Hobbit is made into as much film time as LotR even though it's a much smaller book, as mentioned:

 



> “It was the next logical step after doing Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit,” Jackson said. “In Lord of the Rings, we took over a thousand pages of novel and adapted it to the big screen in three extremely long films. Then in The Hobbit, we took a children’s book a fraction the length of Lord of the Rings, and also made it into three extremely long films.”

 

I'm sorry if I'm coming across angrily or anything in my tone. It's a lot harder for me to know how serious some people are when they say they think this might be real, so I need to make sure that if they DO think it might be real, that they have no doubt that it is fake by the end of this.

Yeah, it´s definitly not a bad call to tell people it is actually FAKE. As for me I thought the responses for example of Glaurung pretty real that he did not really know wether this was fake or not.

Come on people, buying a freaking soeverein country.. You can Not buy a country. You can not remain on this earth for 146 + PJ's age yet. Most people still die at an average age of 83.

I got excited for a new expansion card spoiler or something - oh well, a Silmarillion film series will have to do!

## 16 [OMZA on October 23, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125508-breaking-news/?do=findComment&comment=1309608)

The comments have ended up being even more crazy than the original post -the fake news about the movies.

joezim007;  I was just kidding.....joking around.....you wrote a whole shabang on how its fake.....ha......I just thought it was sort of funny how serious some of you were taking it.  I didn't mean to make it such an issue.....my apologies......If you go back and read over my comments maybe you can see the comical side of it......ha  ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]
