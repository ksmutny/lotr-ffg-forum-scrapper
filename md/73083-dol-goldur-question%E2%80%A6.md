 So on the quest cards for Escape from Dol Guldur it says that the players can only play one ally per round.  Does this classify for Fili and Kili's ability to pull each other into play? Or what about Spirit Bofur's ability to come into play for just a short time?  Kinda confused on this, any clarification would be appreciated.

Put into play (Sneak Attack, Stand and Fight, Bofur, etc.) get around the play restriction.

 Really? Okay. Well that works, we've been playing it only 1 ally no matter how you get him in.  But I guess now I know that we don't really have to do that anymore. Thanks!
