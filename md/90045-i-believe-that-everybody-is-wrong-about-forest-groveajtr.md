Hey Guys!

 

I'm going crazy over this, so please help me.

 

I've read everything there is to read, and it really makes no sense to me, that i'm told to resolve the guarded keyword when i travel to Forest Grove, and then pick up the Athelas from the encounter deck. I know that people say that i shouldn't do it when picking the athelas up from the discard pile. And i agree with that. But why should i trigger the guarded keyword, just because i pick up the Athelas from the encounter deck? The way i see it, the card is never revealed from the encounter deck, and therefore shouldn't trigger the guarded keyword.

 

The FAQ (1.4) says:

 

(1.01) Encounter Keywords Surge, Doomed, and Guarded keywords should be resolved any time the card on which they occur is revealed from the encounter deck, including during setup.

 

And also:

 

 

 

(1.22) "When Revealed" Effects

A card is only considered to be revealed if the card or game effect causing the card to enter play specifically uses a form of the word "reveal".

 

 

 

Forest Grove reads:


Response: After the players explore Forest Grove, search the encounter deck and discard pile for 1 Athelas objective, and add it to the staging area. Then, shuffle the encounter deck.

 

Nowhere does it say reveal.

 

Is everybody really wrong, or is there something i'm not seeing?

 

And some official answer would be great! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Yes, you are correct. These keywords only trigger when the card is revealed from the encounter deck.

This is one instance of the FAQ making things easier - prior to the 1.4 version of the FAQ the rule read

"(1.01) Encounter Keywords    

Surge, Doomed, and Guarded keywords should be resolved any time the card on which they occur enters play, including during setup. "  

(bold added by me - this is what was replaced in version 1.4 of the FAQ)

 

 

I haven't played AJtR since the 1.4 ruling came out - it should be a slight bit easier now.

The Core Set rulebook actually says "... and attach the next card of the encounter deck to the objective when it enters the staging area from the encounter deck, and place them both in the staging area." I don't think it has to be "revealed".

Though that definition is refering to the guarding card.

The discussion is going for wether the guarded card even triggers it´s keyword.

are you sure? I clearly read it as "When it" referes to the objective card. Thus it is correctly that whenever it enters the staging area it must be guarded a new.

Well, the FAQ says that guarded only triggers when the guarded card/objective is revealed from the encounter deck. So it doesn't matter to which the "when it" part refers to (which is indeed not very clear).

 

>>> FAQ pwns rule book.

Also official answer from caleb :

 

> Because the Athelas is not revealed when you trigger the Response of Forest Grove, you place an unguarded Athelas in the staging area.

I am a bit confused, but why is it necessary to revive this topic?  It has been clarified by the developers that the Athelas would be unguarded if it was brought to the staging area as a result of Forest Grove.

Agreed. It has be answered.  It is not guarded when you find it from the Forest Grove response.
