This night I was watching a game in which the question rose if the progress placement should be dealt with the same as Legolas ability, so first on Active Location or B: directly on the questcard bypassing any active location. The wording caused this issue a bit,.because it is not exactly the same like say Abandoned Tools or Legolas but also not very different either. Thus I took the privilige of asking you guys for answers.

Thanks for any help!

Nobody any thoughts?

"Forced: After an enemy is defeated, place 1 progress on this stage. Progress cannot be placed on Goblin Ambush expect by the above effect."

 

Based on that alone, I would put it on the active location first.  I expect the wording "bypassing the active location" if you are meant to do so.  This makes it a challenging stage to clear, but it is a Nightmare quest after all!

Yeah, we thought so also. But in this game, better be safe than sorry. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
