Trying to play Sherlock a little bit, I was going through the numbers on the player cards in Voice of Isengard. They seem to be going in the following sequence: heroes, allies, attachments, events, and below is the list...

 

1 Éomer, Tactics hero

2

3 Saruman, Neutral ally

4 Orthanc Guard, Leadership ally

5

6 Westfold Outrider, Tactics ally

7

8 Rohan Warhorse, Tactics attachment

9

10 Keys of Orthanc, Neutral attachment

11 Legacy of Númenor, Leadership event

12 Deep Knowledge, Lore event

 

I believe this is the first time we are seeing two neutral cards in a box. Also, I predict cards 13 & 14 will be player cards also (namely events). It might be that each sphere gets three cards (including heroes, as in Khazad-dum) but we've already seen three for Tactics. Heirs of Númenor didn't have equal spheral distribution though...

...even with the predicted 14 card total, it only leaves six more to spoil.

we will surely see a good few more events in that 6....i think the doomed is the main feature of this pack and this works best with events.

Yeah, it seems my poor eye-sight confused 8 for 9 concerning the Warhorse.

It is also interesting to see all the previewed encounter cards are numbered quite high, so they may all be from the latter sets.

I was sorta looking into this too. If wouldn't me surprised if they started to standardize the boxes to have 1 of each type of card for each sphere and then 2 heroes that can be whatever sphere. Also throw in 2 neutral cards? I don't know if that's what they're doing but it would be nice to have that kind of standard setup, like they do with the APs.

Yeah, it would make sense. What we are likely going to see though, is that each sphere gets 3 cards, including the heroes, because there are only six slots left for allies and attachments combined. If that holds, then Tactics is all settled and Spirit gets three out of the six not yet revealed, together with one for Leadership and two for Lore. It would also mean that either Lore or Spirit gets two events (particularly fit for the latter).

As an aside, I am starting to put together a Lore deck and may proxy in Deep Knowledge aforetime.

I couldn't resist the temptation, either. I've tried several of the previewed cards. I especially like the Outrider in mono-Tactics, it is another way for such a deck to overcome the willpower deficit (and it is beautifully versatile). The two events (Legacy and Knowledge) look strongest of the set so far, but I am yet to utilize them properly. Strider seems born for the two but I am not playing him at the moment in any of my decks...

You may be right, perhaps there will be more cards, and it is just that the rest are all events - the doomed keyword indeed seems to be working best with that type. On the other hand, I do not expect to see many doomed Tactics cards of any type, as the sphere has no way of reducing the threat...

...At this time...

It didn't have a good way to draw cards either until Foe-Hammer, which is a pretty awesome draw card.

Good point. I would like to see some form of threat reduction for Tactics: if it kept with the flavour of the sphere. Foe-Hammer is a very nice card, but still, Tactics are surely last by some margin as far as the card draw goes.

As for the doomed cards, I also doubt Spirit will get many - for quite the opposite reason - because it would be an obvious sphere to have such cards.

perhaps it would be a good thing to have with tactics then- you really need to think when and how to use it....i mean, what is more risky than going towards sauron's eye in full shining armour? haha

You are right. It is a very good point, Tactics are risky as it is but it feels superbly when it goes well...
