I have 2 core sets, and thus enough dials and tokens and doodats and thingamajigs.  How does one set up the adventure deck from the 2 sets?  Do you only use one of them?  Do you combine them both?  Is it possible to play with *more* than 4 players with additional core sets?

You only use one of them and no they can't play more than 4 players.We have 12 heroes and all of them are unique.This means that you can't have 2 Aragorns in the same game.

 Actually, in theory, you could play with more than four players if each player has only two heroes. The rulebook certainly doesn't support it, but if you're keen, you could always give it a shot and let us know how it goes.

However, the scaling of the game is all to do with the number of players (i.e. how many cards come out of the encounter deck in the Questing phase) so if you play with only 2 Heroes each, the sole benefit you'll get is lowered starting threat, againt reduced characters, fewer resources etc. I can see it making life pretty tricky.
