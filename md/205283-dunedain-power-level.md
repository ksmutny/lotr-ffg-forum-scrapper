Reports from Minas Tirith, where just a company of elves and dunedain just arrived from the city of Osgiliath.

I just played the massing at Osgiliath, with a dunedain Aragorn, Halbarad, Amarthiul deck and a noldor Cirdan Galdor, Arwen deck. I was greatly surprised of the dunedain decks power level.

I have played some solo dunedain decks quite a bit, and was not surprised by the resource acceleration, normal 3 resources, Amarthiul, Steward and Heir of Valandil, but the card draw was even more powerful than I thought. The dunedain deck ran out of cards faster than the noldor deck.

And with Cirdan, it's really hard to not burn through the deck fast.

Another thing, I know that the dunedain deck is powerful in combat, but not HOW powerful it is. For about 5 turns I was engaged with 8 enemies at the same time, and defending 9 enemies and killing the Witch-King one turn. And in the whole game, NO allies did fall in combat.

Then it's the willpower. I had not meant to make good willpower, but the last turn the noldor deck quested for 20 and the dunedain for 39. THAT is real power, and it almost feels like a dwarf power level deck.

How powerful do you think the dunedain deck is?

I've been experimenting with pairing an Aragorn/Amarthiul/Halbarad deck with Cirdan/Arwen/Erestor, and I feel they have the potential to be solid decks, but need some tweaking to flow smoothly - what decklists did you use?

I can write them down later, I don't have them avilible right NOW. But I am no Seastan, so they would proably not be so good.

I'm consistently getting stomped by shadow effects in my leadership-tactics Dunedain deck. I really want to do without Spirit and Lore. How do you manage that? Especially with so many attacks every turn.

This game I played two handed wih a noldor companion deck, but the dunedain deck did nearly all the job, and I use LORE Aragorn, so I can´t help you with a tactics/leadership deck. For shadows I use dunedain Watcher and a Burnign Brand for one attack Aragorn defends. Forest Snare and help with two other, and hasty stroke was used for one attack, but my main stratergy is to take all hits with the face and simply not care about it.

The only way I can think of is to apply direct damage or to attack them before they can attack you.

But I want to keep the enemies alive, at least two of them.

You are running up against the fundamental inconsistency of the Dunedain.

Have you tried Dunedain Watchers? They have worked surprisingly well for me.

 

I'd also suggest a Good Harvest + Forest Snare.

Given that Dunedain benefit from keeping many enemies engaged with you, I think it's pretty evident you are going to want shadow cancellation or attack avoidance. Restricting yourself by not allowing any Spirit or Lore cards, which can provide this easily, is going to make it a lot tougher. I don't think this is a fundamental inconsistency.
