 Or the ranged ability is strictly for wounding enemy engaged on another player?

 Just for enemies engaged with another player, unfortunately.  See Dunhere if you'd like to see the difference.  Almost no one can attack into the staging area.

Duh…I played it wrong.  Gotta play it all over again, starts from "passage through Mirkwood"…

Thanks for the answer.
