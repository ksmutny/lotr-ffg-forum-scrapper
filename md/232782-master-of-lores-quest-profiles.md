Here are running links to my entries in my new blog series, Master of Lore's Quest Profiles [https://masteroflore.wordpress.com/category/quest-profiles/]. I'd like to take a closer look at some favorite scenarios by briefly highlighting the story, geography, artwork, lore, especially nasty encounter cards, and any memorable playthroughs. I am open to feedback and ideas from readers who enjoy these types of articles. As always, no promises on how regularly I will be able to write, but as more profiles are published, I'll work to keep a running log in this post. Thanks for being such a great cooperative gaming community. Happy questing!

Cool, I liked it. Especially the refenernce to whic tolkien work the quest draws from. It could even settle some arguments like: "is this or that part of the Tolkien lore".

Awesome idea, this is really fun to read and adds a lot of value to quests in my opinion :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Your blog is awesome, one of my favourite.

I absolutely love this new series. I love hearing about the lore of each of the quests and locations, and I'm looking forward to seeing how each of them fits into the greater LotR narrative!
