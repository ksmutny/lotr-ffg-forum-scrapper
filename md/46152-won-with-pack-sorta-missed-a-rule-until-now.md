ok ive created a deck with eowyn, beravor and glorfindel, went great on passage through mirkwood.i won easily.....however......everytime i was using the Lorien Guide as placing a progress token on the actual quest, me thinking that seeing as there were no locations active, however looking the rule up on BGG forum i see this is not so

given this, i was healing all damage and placing progress tokens every turn (using eowyns +1 really helped), also glorfindel if kept out of harms way is great, so i reckon i will keep the deck and have another go, using the proper rules this time!

During my first play through with a friend we found we were making things excessively difficult by figuring Threat from engaged Enemies into our Threat checks.  During a couple play-throughs with another friend we had not been allocating excess progress made towards a location onto the main quest.  Next play-throughs should go a lot quicker/smoother haha.
