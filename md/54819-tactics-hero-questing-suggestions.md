 SO I am thinking Tactics should have stupid stuff to help them Quest like:

Quest Action: Take 1 wound Gain 1 Will. 

Quest Action: Double The Printed Will of [_____]. They will not ready during the Refresh step.

Kinda illustrates the plow ahead and bully through method of questing. What do you guys hope to see?

I think this could work

as people have commented elsewhere, there's no point in making tactics brilliant at questing, you lose the flavours of the spheres. BUT the current situtation where they are SO limited is a real pain. This kind of thing seems ideal: options to make their questing viable/gain a short-term boost, but with serious drawbacks/downsides, to stop them just getting 'better'

not sure about teh actual numbers- would probably need a fair bit of play-testing to get balanced.

I think your card ideas were cool and that cards that helped Tactics characters quest should be temporary (for the phase/round).  I don't think these cards would be stupid, but useful. Choice of words?

I believe that the uniqueness of the different spheres will further diminish with future cards. The forerunner here is Spirit (card drawing/Ancient Mathom and resource generation/Zigil Miner in Khazad-Dum) that can do everything except heavy fighting. Tactics will eventually receive questing/willpower support cards and not even necessarily with drawbacks suggested by the OP. Maybe they will be one-use cards or tied to exhausting chars/heroes.

 I agree with not overpowering the Tactics sphere's questing ability. There should be sacrifice for them to quest.
