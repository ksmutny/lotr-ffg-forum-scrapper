I wonder if it is possible to respond to a When Revealed effect during Setup with Eleanor's special ability?

I would guess NO as the game has not really started at this point. Any thoughts?

 I've already asked this, no consensus on this one.

Need to wait for the FAQ, until then you just play it the way you prefer ^^
