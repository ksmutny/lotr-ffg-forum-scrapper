Hi.

I keep stumble over a quest called Maasing at Osgiliath in the forum. What is this quest? Has it come out or is it upcoming? Anyone know?

Massing at Osgiliath was the GenCon special quest. Currently the only way to get it is to have attended GenCon and received a copy, or buy it from someone who has.

It is SUPPOSED to be coming to FFG Print on Demand, but no one knows when.

 I should be available soon, considering the articles about it said it would be available through Print on Demand a month after GenCon.

I'm hoping so, but we're well over a month from GenCon and there still isn't any word at all. :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

 Ah, okay. Good to have something to look forward to...beside the KD expansion...the rest of the SoM adv. packs...and future cycles of adventures :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Thaks for clearing it up for me

This is best quest for now. Very interesting and very difficult also.

The best with this game is the settings, the story and the mood of the game. Not that it has some insanely hard quests for solo play. Best would have bin to make two categories. Solo quests and multiplayer quests. Then when people think that the solo quests are too easy like you they could just go on to the multiplayer and do them solo. Then the overly skilled people like you would not fear easy quests in future adv. packs and hang out underskilled people; and people with a normal skill level would not fear harder quests in future adv. packs and pick on people like you. A perfect solution.

 yeah, I guess it is a perfect solution... there's still a problem with the scaling of quests.... solo is still the hardest mode ever and it gradually gets easier with more players... this "problem" though will persist - if you see 4 players as ONE player - the advantage is clear: you draw 4 cards at least, have up to 12 resources every turn and XXX amount of willpower - of course, you get to draw more cards from the encounter deck - but the "numbers", such as required quest points to progress and fixed threats remain - thus it is always easier to make more progress with more players... also because of specialization: one heals, the other fights, etc...

 

a viable option would be to have a "scale", e.g. as solo player, you "only" need idk 4 quest points, as opposed to 10 with 4 players... etc etc

but I have to say, I like the game so far and have played it to death, the quests are getting harder, which is good, because alle the core set quests were fairly challenging alone, but ridiculous with 4 players :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I like this idea, though technically it's supposed to scale via the 1 extra encounter card per player. That's another set of threat you have to deal with each turn. Unfortunately this doesn't take into account all the extra resources, heroes, etc.

 that's EXACTLY what I mean - I know the encounter deck is supposed to scale things - but you can only go so far with a "game-controled" deck... there is more danger, yes, but this more isn't always MORE, you get me?

as I said, it just can't take EVERYTHING into account... but I'm not complaining! I play solo most of the time and that IS a challenge... I'm sure the guys at FFG will prove themselves crafty, witty little designers and eventually come up with quests that throw you in awe! (not that I think the quests so far have been bad, I like them a lot! Each has a different feel and I like the stories behind that! No exaggerating, just plain simple searching for gollum, helping friends, etc.... I mean, we ARE NOT in the movies... if you wan't that - play Lotr CCG by Decpiher and go all out :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png])

Not really get your points..........

Why this quest is the best for me???? First is mood and staging.Second is hard. You need use you skill to win. Some other quests important only 5 first round. after you already undestand you win only matter of time and scores.But this one no. Until the end you dont know what can happen. Scaling is very good. More players more interesting and hard.

you really feel yourself in the siege city full of enemies. Every stage is different and each stage more and more difficult. There is no time for relax more you progress more danger you meet. Last stage is hell. Witch-King is really Big Problem.  I try this quest many times  solo and everytime is something special.

Other quest sometimes can be very monotony but not this one.  For me is good example how quest is should be done. Dol-guldor is also ok. But most of other quests is boring and easy for me. They are ok but to forseen sometimes. But not HFG, is also very tricky but  easy as well.

Rosghobel sound very promising. Cannot wait, maybe next week i get it.

i hope Khazad-dum will be done the proff. level as Massing or Dol-Guldor.

Yeah, that's the point. But FFG is getting better and better with scalability. Journey down the Anduin wasn't good (2B: 2 encounter cards is difficult for solo games, but it doesn't matter much if you are 4 players and have 5 encounter cards revealed), and Escape from Dol Guladur also (if you're playing solo, you have 3 bad objectives attached on only 3 heroes. With 4 players, 3 objectives but up to 12 heroes. And the impact on ressource generation because 1 hero being captured in a solo play, but still starting with the threat of all 3 heroes, that can be brutal.). But with HfG they started scaling (The Old Ford; only players with a clue can go questing in 3B); they increased this in the Carrock (number of those damned Sacked! cards depends on number of players); and I hope/think Rhosgobel scales really nice (Rhosgobels threat strength is player-dependent; the timing mechanism is also depending on the number of players: with 4 players, you'll draw Swarming Insects 4 times faster as when you're playing solo; in 2B the cost for looking at 3 encounter cards and choosing 1 is also proportional to the player number; and finally there's only 1 Wilyador helping you but he's "shared" between all players). I didn't have the chance to play Rhosgobel other than solo, but I think it'll scale brilliantly. I'm really looking forward to play this quest with my brother...

Let's see if this development continues and FFG achieves the same difficulty level regardless of the number of players in future scenarios. They're on a good path.

the larger the number of players, the harder it is to predict the encounter deck - in a quest like Carrock where you're wanting to quest slowly, that can be an issue - you commit enough willpower to the quest, get a few good (or perhaps in this situation bad) cards, and you've completed stage 1 in a single turn, with no time to amass resources and allies.

I think the AP quests are doing a pretty good job of scaling - certainly better than Anduin or Dol Guldur - sure this means things will just keep on getting better.

That what i call game balance. Scaling, Difficult level, cards balance (not to powerful not to weak+alternitive). Was really awful from begining.

Now step by step better. But still scaling is bad. More then 2 players the game is to easy.

All the quest (exept Massing) have same sickness. When you start you weak and in the middle of the game you more strong by attachments and allies.But encounter deck play with same power all the time. So for begining is hard and in the middle or end of the game is easy and boring. There is point in the middle of the game when you already understand you win. I hate this!!!!

All core quests + Carrock have this sickness. Hfg is more tricky you never now but the quest himself to easy so this not make really sense.

Looks like Roshgobel change it,  good.

In Massing in Osgiliath build up right. More you porgress more dangerous effect on the encounter cards. Some cards doom 1 but on the last stage start to be doom 3.Enemies get more attack strange with staging and so on.Many cards have shadow effect and they are strong.

And that how the quest should to be in my opinion.

 wow! sounds awesome! can't wait for the print on demand scenario to come out... GREAT!

and yes, of course, FFG is getting better with the scaling - not only with the encounter deck draw mechanism, but also with the "sacked" scaling, or clue "scaling", or old ford (x number of allies in play), etc. it IS getting better and let's hope it continues...

in my opinion, Khazad-Dum will be either the groundbreaking experience we've all been waiting for and thus rule the fate of the game, or it will dilute the game and that wouldn' be so good...

but, again: In FFG, I trust :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

there's certainly a point at which you can feel like you're going to get there, but particularly with lots of players, you're always vulnerable to a string of one type of cards - 4 locations and no northern tracker you've got problems. - 4 treachery cards, same issue - especially some of the nastier ones - deal x additional encounter cards, where x is the number of players - suddenly you're looking at 7 cards coming out - through in a few damage to all characters (or all exhausted characters), or a couple of 'raise your threat by the total of the staging area' and you're dead.

Yes if you talkin about Massing in Osgiliath i agree.

But other quests sessions 3 players my experience was to easy and we start even play reveal 4 cards instead 3 and after we stop to play more then 2 players cose to boirng.We dont want reveal 5 cards cose is already to far from official rules.

I couldn't dissagree more with you. I don't wanna fight and that's why I just deleeted my first looong response :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] But I think you have a very arrogant way of expressing yourself. And that has nothing to do with your english which actually is really good :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] The only thing I'll say for whoever gamedesigner that might read this thread is that you don't speak for eanyone else that yourself, and that there's MANY out there that has enough challenge, enjoyment, frustration and excitement with the game and the levels as it is now. I hope there will be something for everyone later one both level 1,2 and 3 quests as well as 4-10, 11 maybe even 12. But I hope for EVERYTHING not only the easy ones OR the hard ones. As long as there's a good story I don't care if it's too easy which I don't think it is. So that's my last comment in this thread. Peace out :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 Thomas isn't the only person who is getting annoyed with you.  i've seen a good deal of posts of you going on and on about how every aspect of the game is easy.  i've come to two possiblities.  1) You don't fully understand the rules, perhaps due to a language barrier or 2) You're lying to get attention.

I've been reading Glaurung's posts as well and I don't see a problem with them. He is passionate about the game and really likes a challenge. Honestly, I like my games to be challenging as well. I haven't had enough experience playing this yet to get to the point where I feel the game is too easy, but I can see that happening.

He does make some good points about scaling though. The scaling is nice, but it's far from perfect. More players means an easier game.

 actually... talk about difficult games - I just lost a solo Passage through Mirkwood with a Deck, that beat that scenario almost 90% of the time :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] embarassing... just EVERYTHING went wrong... and then these hummerhorns, curse them :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] embarassing for a guy with 100+ games :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

and we also lost the journey to the anduin, 3 players, 2 core sets... THAT happens :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png])) but I LOVE it, because it makes things more interesting...

Thanks for support words Sven!!!

I just try to show some weak points of the game in my opinion and sure i dont lie and dont want show my self like im cool and the best player and for me the game is peace of cake. I love the game so much.

I just wish for the game be more interesting and more challenge, that all.

I think my problem i buy 2 core set from begining and start to make 3 copies 50 cards decks. With this kind of decks for now game easy. So maybe FFG idea is slowly start and then make it more  and more challenge.....  Until now they still not introduce us the tournament system. So maybe im rush a bit????

 :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] By the way, have you checked these two quest out? They are home made and I don't know how good they are in play as I haven't tried them yet but they look proff.

 

First I think is the same level as Journey down the Anduin or just below

And the second is level 7 by the makers standard.

I heard that the Massing at Os was going to be available as PoD here... and have checked back several times.

If one of you see it get posted here, I'd appreciate a notification to the BGG website for the expansion pack.  I've subscribed to the page and as soon as someone posts that it is available, I'll see it and can come get it.
