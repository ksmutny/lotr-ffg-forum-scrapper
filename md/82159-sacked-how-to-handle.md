So,  I was told there was no way to remove a sack card from a Hero unless the hero dies or you have a card that removes it (not sure if this even exists). If this is true, then how do you overcome all your Hero's getting sacked? Having a ton of Allies?

First of all, which scenario are you talking about?

 

There are 2 scenarios were you can have your heroes sacked: Conflict at the Carrock and We Must Away, Ere Break of Day.

In Conflict at the Carrock: Miner of the Iron Hills can remove a Sack. Play it from your hand and remove the Sacked, which counts as a Condition attachment.  Play him with Sneak Attack, or use Born Aloft to put him back in your hand so you can do it more than once.  Also, killing a troll allows you to remove a sack.  I don't think there is any other way out.

In We Must Away Ere Break of Day: if Troll Camp is in play, Bilbo can remove sacks via the ability he gains from that card (exhaust him and spend one Baggins resource).  I think that's the only way out of a sack in that card--- so keep those trolls engaged with you, don't let them flee to the staging area!

Die and get Landrovaled? Fortune or Fate too. Although those are more out of the sack and in a troll's belly kind of ways out.

Still, always good to think outside of the sack…. err, box!

Sorry - I was referring to We Must Away…..

Thanks! I will look for the Troll Camp card.

Although Landroval can be used only once per game.

 

Be sure you have at least one hero in play, because if not you are out of the game.. Or should I say out to the trolls belly…
