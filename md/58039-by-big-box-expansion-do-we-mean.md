the size of the core set box?  im just curious as to the actual size of the box as it looks that size in the picture but to me that would seem like a big waste of space inside...mind you id prefer that, it would look better.  what have other LCGs packed big box exp. in?

In the Game of Thrones LCG the major expansion boxes are 8 inches by 8 inches, 1 1/2 inches high.

 They designed it that way so you can store the cards from the coming Adventure Packs in that big box :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
