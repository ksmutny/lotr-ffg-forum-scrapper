Promo card? Or part of the Hobbit encounter set?

it's part of the special GenCon quest that was announced awhile back (just like Massing at Osgiliath last year). it will probably be POD in a few weeks.

I played in the event at Gencon……this quest is absolutely brutal.  I played with another and we got DEMOLISHED by this quest.  We are talking Smaug killing two heroes in the first quest phase hard.  The questing is so difficult we had to raise our threat by 17 one phase.  

That being said it was a lot of fun…..this is an extreme challenge to say the least.  I don't think anyone at the con was able to beat it.  I did hear one table cheering that they passed the first quest phase, haha!

 We need someone to post scans……….otherwise the german players need to wait months before we can play this scenario…..

I think much has been posted at various sites (see BGG, specifically the "Battle of Lake-town" page, for example). all pictures, no scans, but it's there. what I think you really need is the card list (with numbers) from that you could work out the encounter deck and play it with proxies. here's the link, see the pictures:

so while a few scans would be nice, in the interim, perhaps a card list will do (I don't have or I'd post it).

 Sadly BGG has got no locations, and there must be other cards missing…….
