Hi all,

 

A couple of questions about the Witch of Angmar : http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/angmar-awakened-cycle/the-dread-realm/witch-of-angmar-r1701 [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/angmar-awakened-cycle/the-dread-realm/witch-of-angmar-r1701]

 

1) What happens with Erkenbrand's (http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/the-ring-maker-cycle/the-antlered-crown/erkenbrand-r1292 [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/the-ring-maker-cycle/the-antlered-crown/erkenbrand-r1292]) ability here ? If he pays to cancel the shadow effect, do you still resolve the sorcery when revealed effect ? What if there is no shadow effect but there is a sorcery effect ?

 

2) Can A Test of Will cancel a sorcery card which ends up being revealed by the Witch of Angmar's ability ?

 

and on an unrelated note

 

3) How on earth do you beat this quest ?  :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

Erkenbrand and similar shadow cancellation just cancel the shadow effects, rather than the card, so I think the Witch's ability resolves.

 

Test of Will probably won't work because it's not been revealed from the encounter deck.

Traps work very well in this quest.  

 

Reanimated dead are easy prey for direct damage.  Goblin-cleaver or a Gondorian Spearman with a Spear of the Citadel attached can take them out immediately, and the new Skyward Volley event from The Grey Havens is nice here too.  

 

Repeatable direct damage effects are also great for the fight with Daechanar: Dwarrowdelf Axe in a Dwarf deck, Galadhon Archer+Pursuing the Enemy with Silvans, Spear of the Citadel on Beregond in a Gondor or general purpose deck, Firefoot smashing Reanimated Dead in a Rohan/Eomer deck.  Mighty Prowess is also a nice card to consider.

 

And Condition-removing effects are useful, with Power of Orthanc being the star of the show in multiplayer.

Ditto on Dwarrowdelf Axe being amazing for this quest. Also, Boromir can be pretty great for his self sacrificing ability for when those Cursed dead come back all at once and he takes out any Reanimated Dead engaged as well. Helps if you have a partner running heavy spirit that can Fortune or Fate him back.
 

Also Altar of Midwinter is surprisingly not immune to player card effects, so I think you can do some shenanigans like playing Short Cut as soon as it is revealed.
