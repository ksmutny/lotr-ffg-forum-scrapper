I really hate using sleeves. I hate the way they feel and how the cards shuffle with sleeves on. However, I also love my games and hate it when my cards get worn or damaged. So far I have resisted sleeving my LotR:LCG game but I'm reconsidering now that I'm starting to see some wear on them.

So, I'm wondering how many other people out there prefer to play unsleeved? Thoughts?

 The art sleeves are coming out soon - I plan to use them.

I prefer playing unsleeved but I have to confess I've been considering sleeving them recently for the same reasons as you. Some signs of wear.

A Related question - are the ultra pro soft sleeves good enough for this game?

Or is worth paying the extra and going for premium - it is almost 6 times the prices... (3 bucks for 50 vs. 1 buck for 100)

I use penny sleeves pretty much exclusively on cards of this size. All my LCG decks (CoC, W:I and LotR) are penny sleeved.

Sleeves aren't so bad.  You get what you pay for, though.  If you buy penny sleeves, you'll probably be annoyed at them. I use the FFG sleeves, and they are fabulous.  Took me a while for my OCD tendencies to get over the fact that they are ever so slightly big for the cards, though.  Not to mention they are **** expensive.  The art sleeves coming out soon will be even more so.  I've liked Mayday sleeves on other games.  And the price isn't too horrible.  I've considered switching, even though I already have about 500 FFG sleeves.  Basically, in the long run it would save money.

I originally used Ultra Pro sleeves and even at 25% of the cost I don't think it was worth it...there have been numerous times where cards have inadvertently wound up in the wrong decks due to cards sticking to each other, I have also found it difficult to shuffle for the same reason.

I’m new to sleeving, so perhaps the sleeves will be better over time or maybe I just bought the wrong kind. Regardless I went and bought the FFG sleeves to replace the Ultra Pro ones and think they are great…but expensive!

I've used sleeves on Arkham Horror and its various expansions, but I only just recently got AGoT and LotR LCG's, and have thus never used them on LCG's before.  In Arkham Horror, my main complaint is that sleeves prevent the cards from stacking very well, and it also makes them more challenging to shuffle.  This is not as big a deal in Arkham Horror as I imagine it would be in an LCG where you're shuffling your decks much more frequently.

However, I really like the look of the LotR art sleeves, so I imagine I'll end up trying them out for this game at least, if not AGoT.

I don't like sleeves either. I prefer the feel of the actual card. Besides, a bit of wear just adds character.

Thanks, I do have ~ 270 ultra pro deck protectors, so I will probably just use those for the decks and buy some penny sleeves for the encounter cards.

 I use the standard FFG clear card sleeves.  They are awesome to me. Extremely durable and very affordable (2.50-2.99 per 50).  Also, what I like the best about clear sleeves is that you still get to see the beautiful card art on the back of the cards (graphic card sleeves eventually pick up tons of wear and scratch/ fade).  However, "Each to his own boys, there's plenty for all!"

 The coloured FFG sleeves are very good. Tight fit, stiff back. But the new UltraPro coloured sleeves are tighter. MayDay sleeves are also supposed to be good, but I've only ever used (and found) the board game sizes.

It's easier to shuffle with good sleeves, and unprotected cards get banged up quickly from normal use. The cards do get quite a bit quicker when sleeved up, so get help from a friend with manly hands if shuffling the encounter deck is a problem :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

I'd buy the LotR art sleeves in a heartbeat if I saw them actually available. The CoC/Arkham sleeves are great, but pre-orders turn me off.

## 14 [gatharion on August 28, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52176-sleeves-or-no-sleeves/?do=findComment&comment=520998)

 As of now, I just have my Hero cards sleeved. I might sleeve all the cards down the line, but mostly if I have particular decks that I really intend to use on a near consistent basis. That way I can use the sleeves for the extra purpose of quick visual identification.

## 15 [gone questing on August 28, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52176-sleeves-or-no-sleeves/?do=findComment&comment=521275)


Wow, i'm suprised so many people don't prefer sleeves!

I started with other games and did a lot of online trading, and having sleeves simply means you are protecting some of the money you've invested. For LCGs, you aren't trading, however, will you wear your cards to the point that they don't look as great or that you need to buy more?

I also play poker and flick the corners of two stacks to shuffle, then cut, and so on. I never jam two edges together to shuffle.
That's where I find slips to be so great! You can really shuffle a lot more freely as the edges are sharper and the slips' surface can be a lot smoother.

I prefer the 'el cheapo' sleeves as I found Ultro Pro sleeves had been getting shorter and shorter over time and i'd simply had enough. (The opposite OCD of another poster.) The 'el cheapo' sleeves are quite thin so shuffle really well, however, my brother bought the FFG sleeves and they are longer than Ultra Pro and more durable than the 'el cheapo' sleeves. I would seriously consider buying them next as I feel they are near perfect for my tastes.

Brand new slips don't stack well for a short period of time, maybe a dozen games, but will flatten slightly and will have less air/change shape.

Lastly, I find that cards in brand new slips, like lacker on wood, just makes the card's design and artwork really POP!

I love sleeves and the glossy feel they give to my deck ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

## 17 [Svenn on September 23, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52176-sleeves-or-no-sleeves/?do=findComment&comment=532175)

I have never used sleeves and always hated the idea. I love the feel of cards and I don't like the idea of glossy covers. However, I want to protect my cards.

I'm looking at picking up some to try them out, but I can't decide what to go with. What I REALLY want are some clear sleeves so I can see the actual backs. I see that FFG makes some, but I can't actually find them anywhere. Do they still make these and are they the same quality as the colored back ones (it looks like they might be different types of sleeves)? I see Dragon Shield clear sleeves but those are more expensive, and from what I read are longer than the cards are which will bug me I think. Anyone have opinions on those?

Also, anyone with sleeves want to take some pictures of their cards in sleeves? ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

Got to say the FFG coloured sleeves are excellent and really add a touch of class to the game. Nice tactile feel and sturdily built.

## 19 [radiskull on September 23, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52176-sleeves-or-no-sleeves/?do=findComment&comment=532204)

The FFG clear sleeves are great - I know that most FLGSs will order them for you, but if that's not great for you, then you can certainly order them direct from FFG.

I usually order everything online... but I can't find these anywhere right now. FFG does not have them in stock, Miniature Market does not have them in stock. Cool Stuff Inc does not have them in stock. Amazon has 1 seller selling them... but at more than 3 times the price.

Any idea the difference between the FFG clear sleeves and the Dragon Shield sleeves?

## 21 [lostintheverse2 on September 23, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52176-sleeves-or-no-sleeves/?do=findComment&comment=532261)

I really wasn't expecting to sleeve my decks. I did try to resist b/c I think shuffling w/ sleeves is more difficult than without. Also, the extra space that the decks take up sleeved is irritating, but not as irritating to me as seeing the wear on the art of the cards. I use clear Ultra Pros that I bought in bulk (I think it was like 10 boxes of 50 for like $18).

 

## 22 [Svenn on September 28, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52176-sleeves-or-no-sleeves/?do=findComment&comment=533909)

Well, I bought a set of Dragon Shield clear sleeves for testing out. I still prefer the feel of bare cards, but these things are nice! They handle a lot better than I was expecting from sleeves. I'd like to also try out some of the plain FFG clear ones if they ever get them back in stock... then it's just a matter of deciding whether to sleeve ALL the cards or just the decks I use. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

## 23 [Vrijewandelaar on September 28, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52176-sleeves-or-no-sleeves/?do=findComment&comment=533982)

i always play with sleeves i hate te see my cards get damaged.
for lord of the rings LCG i use Ultra Pro clear sleeves (new size) for encounter / Quests cards. and for the 4 spheres i use color sleeves that match the symbol color or close 2 matching. neutral cards i sleeve black. 

im however thinking of switching to only clear sleeves cause the artwork on the back is pretty awesome. i wudnt use the FFG art sleeves cause in my oppinion art sleeves do get sticky and dirty quite quickly, and the ultra pro ones (the colored for sure) have some sort of rough texture that prevents them from getting sticky.

 

just sharing my oppinion.

## 24 [Untergeher on September 28, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52176-sleeves-or-no-sleeves/?do=findComment&comment=534017)

Used to sleeve my MtG cards simply because I didn't want to ruin some of the more precious rares...

When I started playing Thunderstone I didn't sleeve the cards (because I thought: it's just a deckbuilding game, so what the heck), but later regretted that decision due to the fact that you can notice the differences between older and newer cards very easily... so it's not really hard to tell if the card you're going to draw is from the base set or from an expansion...

When it comes to LCG and especially Lord of the Rings I'm a big fan of sleeves and use the clear ones by FFG. They're a bit bigger than the cards, but I don't mind, because they shuffle well and have a nice feel to them.

Just my two cents...

I play primarily multi-player, so I find sleeving essential.  Different sleeves make it easy to identify which cards belong to whih deck ("was that my Steward of Gondor, or yours?"), along with all of the other advantages people have mentioned.

This is how I feel as well.  Also, with all the money I sink into games I think it helps to see em

wear and tear a bit so I see my "monies worth" manifesting itself in time.

So, I started buying the FFG clear gaming sleeves and I absolutely love them...however, my local game store (and even another that I occasionally frequent) keeps running out of them (I have called 4 times over the last month and a half) and they consistently tell me that it is not their fault but FFs. Apparently FFG does not consistently print and ship these sleeves. I am so frustrated at waiting for these sleeves that I am either going to start using another brand that I can readily get per each expansion pack, or I am going to not use them at all. Thanks a lot FFG for not consistently making your product available to me...I mean, really? I would buy at least 2 packs a month if you guys would produce them regularly. Marketing lesson 101: if it sells really well, keep producing it and make sure it gets to your local game stores on time.  You guys are really annoying me in this regard.

On a positive note: what an awesome game this is! Give me card sleeves!

 I find the Clear Ultra Pro premium card protectors superior to the FFG sleeves. They are stiffer and have a better tactile feel in my hand.  (just my opinion of course)

 

Try them out guys!

i like to have some refreshments when i play a game . some snacks. i usually never spill my drink. only when i play with no sleeves. or your friends are into the cheesies and you figure they have the common sense to wipe their hands clean before getting them all over your cards. no. also the edges of the cards get white from shuffling so much. i'll risk playing without sleeves once and a while, but to protect your investments , go with sleeves.

Since I posted this I had a friend give me a bunch of black-backed sleeves he just had lying around so now all of my encounter cards are also sleeved. Down the road I might get more sleeves for the player cards, but it's not a priority.

out of curiosity why would you want to use sleeved covers at all? The back card art is pretty cool. .I am using clear ones.

I was given black ones. That's why. I bought green ones for the Heroes so they'd be visually distinctive. If I were to buy sleeves for my my player cards, they'd probably be clear.

I use colored sleeves for the different decks and clear ones for the encounter cards. mostly you should consider sleeves if you consider your investment important. thinking back to the early days of card games I have the nuclear war games and they are easy to distinguish by level of grime go back set by set. even clean hands will leave some trace behind and grubby little cheeto encrusted gamer hands will certanly leave marks.

@ OP

 

If you dont like sleeves, why would you want to use them?

Magic players use sleeves since a single card can easily cost a bucket full of monnies. Damage on cards hurt the resell value. Your  individual LotR cards don't have any high value whatsoever because every card is "fixed". (Due to the nature of how the core set is layed out this isnt entirely true). Normal play will never damage your cards to a point where you can tell them apart by looking at the backside. So if you dont like them theres no reason at all to use them. And when you spill cola over your sleeved cards theyre game over as though as they were unsleeved.

I like sleeves, I like the look and feel, I like how I can tell decks apart by using different colours. Its an expensive fun though, sleeving 3 decks (in decent sleeves) costs as much as a new expansion...

 

## 37 [Budgernaut on February 24, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52176-sleeves-or-no-sleeves/?do=findComment&comment=598464)

 I saw this thread and some others like it a few weeks after getting the core set. The argument that normal shuffling will damage your cards ate away at me but I didn't do anything. I had never used sleeves before (played 3 previous card games) so I wasn't sure how necessary it was. When I finally got an Adventure Pack and boy did I see a difference. So I talked to my local game store about what they thought would be the best sleeves and they said to go with FFG sleeves. So I ordered 12 packs and sleeved my entire LotR library and now I just want to throw my thoughts out there for others who are considering sleeves. 

Expense: FFG sleeves are expensive. At $3.00 a pack, it was gonna be $36 to sleeve all my cards. That's almost like getting a second core set. But my game store gave me a discount so each pack was about $2.50 instead, knocking the price down to $30.

Shuffling: This was my biggest concern and is still my biggest gripe. When you shuffle, it's possible that the bottom corner of one sleeve will slide into the top of another sleeve so that when you try to slide the two stacks together you the cards get stuck. The trick to this is to try to shuffle the stacks along a straight edge instead of corners. It takes some practice, but I don't find it too big of a pain. In fact, if you don't get the sleeves stuck in each other, shuffling is actually a whole lot smoother. I really like it.

Space: I store my cards in the core set box with the insert inverted to form two rows. All my cards fit in one row before sleeves. After sleeves they almost take up half of the second row. I don't think it's a big deal, but if you're tight on space, it's something to consider.

Stacking: My cards are freshly sleeved and still in the stage where the slightest nudge will send the stack sliding all over. This can be annoying, but I think it doesn't bother me because psychologically I'm forcing myself to be happy with my purchase. Another thing I hadn't understood from previous posts is that the cards don't lie flat. I'd read this but didn't quite get the concept. Let's say you're OCD like me and all your cards have to face the same direction at all times. Also, you want the orientation of your sleeves the same. Well if the bottom of all the sleeved cards are lined up, that end is actually taller than the top end of the cards. If I understand correctly, this will go away in time, but it was something I wasn't expecting. If you don't care which way your cards face I don't think you'll have this issue.

Luster: The sleeves reflect light really well. Sometimes I find myself having to tilt my cards in different directions to try and read my card because my overhead lights are being reflected right at my eyes. Not a deal-breaker, but again, something I didn't anticipate.

Size: The FFG sleeves are a bit larger than the card, as has been mentioned. I was expecting a much tighter fit. There is about a millimeter or so on the tops and sides if you shove the card all the way into the sleeve. I have no problem with this, and it may even be a part of why shuffling is easier. I don't know.

Well, those are some thoughts from a customer new to sleeves. All in all I'm really happy with my purchase and would recommend sleeves.

Best sleeves hands down are dragon shields. Nothing comes close for thickness and awesomeness. Many people will use double or even triple sleeves of ultra or ffg sleeves.. no need with DS. I recently got 1000 FFG sleeves for my coc collection and found them extremely bad. They are thin, and really long, hanging so far off then end of the card .. like nearly 5mm. DS are a perfect fit and so thick and luxurious.

If your not sleeping your cards you are foolish. End of story. No matter how careful you are, you will damage them one day though accident, and even if you do not ... witch you will, the simple act of shuffling and handling will warp and chip the edges. This is not possible for this to not to happen. If people say you can they are either lying, do not play often with the cards often or just idiots. Also if you play with more people than yourself, like say a few mates come over and this game hits the table... well no one is as careful with other peoples toys are you are with your own.

If you have all the sets so far you are already around 200 bucks. It amazes me the some people will not sleeve, yo already spent the money, it is only a few bucks more to sleeve. If your some kind of bum with out a job and can not afford to sleeve then stop being a waste on society and go get some work.

A cheaper option for some would be to get the extremely good ultrapro binders. You can place the cards in there, then sleeves are you play. This adds up to your game setup time, but means you only need like a few hundred (2-4 boxes) of dragons shields for an entire solo collection.

Protects your cards, makes shuffling easier, imo look better and feels better ... sleeves are a no brainier.

Regardless of resale value, I like to protect things that I buy. At first I didn't sleeve my cards, but after 5 or so plays, I definitely saw a bit of wear on some of my cards. I like the aesthetic appeal of the cards, and would hopefully like to get several years of use out of them. In my opinion, Dragonshields are the way to go.
