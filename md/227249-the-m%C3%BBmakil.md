Yay, Harad ally that confirms existance of a lot of others Harad allies.

Have to say, the quest sounds a little...well..."silly" is probably the best term, but I'll reserve judgment until we get a chance to see how it actually plays out (especially with the rest of the cycle).

 

The player cards, though, look pretty good!  Keep Watch will go great in a Dunedain deck, trying to stay engaged with several enemies constantly!

Probably at least as an Objective-Attachment in one or more of the quests.

With each new announcement that doesn't mention Palantiri, magic rings or other artifacts my desperation grows worse. 

 

Also, the idea of this quest sounds really silly to me. We're actually going to hunt Oliphaunts to use as mounts? That sounds like some joke someone from COTR came up with "cuz it's cool". Wait, it actually is.

 

This sounds very fanCOTRservicy to be honest.

 

The Harad ally is by far the best thing about this.

The idea of Mighty Warrior interests me (in the hope that other cards will show up for the other similar triaits).

Hunting party clearly is one of the dual trait cards.  "committed" certainly is part of "committed to the quest", and "non-unique" likely refers to an encounter card, but the "reveal" is usually revealing from the encounter deck.  That would make replacing a non-unique enemy with another revealed card possible, except that I don't generally want to do that, let alone pay 1 for it.  So it's got to be something cooler.

 

The song of hope has you pay 1 resource for something and is limited to one per hero, so I'm guessing it's a very useful effect.

 

Mighty Warrior is interesting, in that it replaces itself, so it's only the 1 resource that costs, not the deck space.  But making a hero a warrior isn't worth 1 tactics resource for the cards we have, so there (hopefully) is something really cool coming for warriors in the next pack.  (I don't think Coney in a Trap qualifies on that score.)

Hmmmm this is an interesting pack. I have to say that I do somewhat agree with others saying this quest seems silly and/or forced. It also definitely gives that fan service feel... "whats that? you guys always wanted to ride a Mumakil but couldn't? Well now you can!". I'm going to withhold final judgement however as the tales throughout the cycles and deluxe boxes have been really great and stick to the lore pretty perfectly (especially in the last few cycles) so maybe taming and riding some Mumakil makes sense for the storyline of this cycle. Still seems pretty cheesy though...

Also not sure I agree that this Harad ally is such a great thing either to be honest. That is for one reason; that she seems to intimate there will be not just a few Harad allies but potentially a whole ton of them. Do we really want them to almost be a faction of there own? At this point there is no doubt in my mind that we will get at least one Harad hero in this cycle considering we will soon receive a Corsair hero (and we don't have ANY corsair allies but we will be getting Harad allies..) in the current one. I am totally happy to receive a few special Harad allies but if we get too many and then Harad heroes it will become its own faction which to me is really weird. I get that Harad is only under Sauron's sway because of fear and whatnot and that many of its people are not that different from other free people of middle earth but to be able to play a "Harad Deck" just seems so weird and wrong to me.. Really hope that we only see like 3 or 4 special Harad allies we can include in our decks rather than a whole ton of them. Not that I play only thematic decks or anything but for those who do the only thematic way of using them I can think of is in a Gondor deck by picturing them as refugees/turncoats from Harad that want to oppose the Dark Lord. 

The other player cards are more exciting to me and I love that we will be seeing plenty of cards that reward us for playing with multiple traits. Really hoping we get some strong Dunedain + Noldor cards and that they don't just skip that trait combo because they already gave us Tale of Tinuviel...... that would suck so hard....
Also really hope we get some cards that require different traits from the same race such as Gondor + Rohan and to me personally much more importantly Silvan + Noldor. 

Coney in a Trap is a nice Lore verison of Feint that requires a ranger and warrior character. I wonder if any other of these trait oriented cards we get are slightly different versions of existing cards/effects in other spheres that also require characters of various traits so that the "sphere bleed" is not as heavy. 

Also we get this snippet: "Additionally, there are several player cards that become more powerful when you complete side quests, including an exciting new Ranger hero! But we can get to that later…"
So it seems as though not only will we get various player cards that become more powerful when you complete side quests (there is one in the victory display) but we will also get a hero that is somewhat based on side quests/completing side quests.

I am really excited about all this love for side quests as I am a big fan of player side quests and have included Gather Information and Send for Aid in my decks since they were released. I really like the design of the previous side quest we saw that allows players to pay for their first ally each turn with any resources and this newly revealed one that gives engaged enemies -1 attack that both only benefit you once they are in the victory display but I am more excited to see player cards that power up once a side quest is in the victory display as they will work well with old side quests like Gather Information and Send for Aid as well as the new ones. 

Overall I think that we are going to get AMAZING player cards with some great mechanics and abilities as well as some really interesting and different quests. Alongside the whole theme of being stuck in a foreign land trying to get back to Gondor I think that the theme will be discovering that many of the peoples of Harad are actually against the Dark Lord and that it is almost like a nation enslaved by fear and deceit (hence harad allies and whatnot). I imagine there will be a full on desert quest with those wereworms and some sort of temple or ruin quest in the desert in which we enter ancient underground ruins.

Something that would be really neat for fans of the blue wizards would be a quest in which we discover the cult/following that they tried to lead against the Dark Lord and have to help them escape their own lands or alternatively help them find some hidden desert base they can live in and recruit more followers to.

So has anybody else noticed that the article says it will be out Q4 2016? That seems fast to me. That means FGG plans to ship 3 Dreamchaser APs, the Sands of Harad deluxe, and the first AP of the Harad cycle in the next 5 months.

5 products in 5 months is faster than our usual feast/famine cycle, if I'm not mistaken.

Also, they've finally done the thing that in my opinion should have been done long ago with every trait-giving attachment, starting from Nor am I a Strangler: they added +1 card into the package.

Harad is in the south. The blue wizards went east.

But Harad is one of the most eastern countries, too.

It could be quite possible to find a trace of them. I doubt that we will (ever) see blue wizards in person, but find some clues (stories, artifacts etc.) about/from them, similiar to shadow of mordor (the Videogame) where some Texts about the blue wizards were "hidden" in items.

Harad is west of Mordor, Esgaroth and the Iron Hills. Might as well look for Blue wizards there.

Is Coney in the Trap a bit disappointing? Altogether, it is a bit worse than Feint, right? Because you can only prevent the enemy from attacking on the round it engages you. I cannot think of any advantages it has over Feint. So, even though it is still nice to have such a card in Lore, I would think with the requirement (and it is not very common to have both a ranger and warrior in a deck -- though not quite rare, either), the card could have cost 0, because I think most of the decks that do have a warrior and ranger might feature Tactics and thus have access to Feint. What do others think?

 

Keep Watch seems really nice. I always like cards that combo with Beorn. This one seems exceptionally effective with him, although you need first to put it in the victory display.

Also, there is only 1 innate warrior in Lore - Glorfindel. Lorefindel making a comeback confirmed?

Feint is too good, so it's good that new cards of the same type are weaker. If I had a deck with qualifying heroes, I think I'd happily play this card. Even if I had 3 x Feint in my deck I would still happily play this card.

For straight Lore you're correct, there's only Glorfindel.  However, both Leadership and Spirit look to have several Unique characters with the Warrior trait, so it could still be useful in dual-sphere decks that don't want to include Tactics.

> Harad is west of Mordor, Esgaroth and the Iron Hills. Might as well look for Blue wizards there.

On the map depicting "The west of Middle-Earth at the end of the Third Age", Far Harad does not appear, but the words "Near Harad" are printed *east* of the words "Mordor", "Esgaroth", and "Iron Hills".  The word "Harad" in Near Harad is directly south of the Lake of Rhun.  The Harad road runs well west of the "Near Harad", and I think it's clear that Harad extends all the way to the coast, so parts of Harad must be west of the three places mentioned -- but it's also runs east of Esgaroth, Iron Hills, and probably Mordor.  I think "Harad" may be applied to all land south of Mordor, no matter how far east it goes, and it may go a very long ways east.

 

However, since our cycle plot has us returning to Gondor, I don't expect our quests to be in the eastern parts of Harad.  I was hoping we'd go East across Harad then north through Rhun (passing to the east of Mordor), but I guess it's not to be.

 

In his 1958 letter Tolkien has the other two wizards go "south and east", but the later writings only mention the east, and Harad is exclusively associated with "the south" in the lore--and I'm not expecting FFG to challenge the fan's perception of what the blue wizards were and did, though they certainly could be justified by Tolkien's writings.  However, we know from the main text of LOTR that Gandalf spent enough time in the south to acquire the name Incanus, it would be lovely to find something in this cycle that references Gandalf's labor there.

 

Aragorn went south far enough to apparently reach the southern hemisphere, but I doubt we will.  According to Appendix A, he "went alone far into the East and deep into the South, exploring the hearts of Men, both evil and good, and uncovering the plots and devices of the servants of Sauron."  So good men among the Southrons and Easterlings are textually supported, though I'll admit it would be weird to play a Harad deck, especially outside Harad itself.

If I recall correctly, "Harad" and "Rhun" don't even refer to names of kingdoms or nations, but simply mean "South" and "East", respectively, in Sindarin.  So in a literal sense, the blue wizards went Rhun (never studied Sindarin, so please forgive me if articles should be used).  Of course, that also brings up the question, East from where?  The Harad regions could be East, specifically, from some locations, but if East is being used as a more general way, Rhun would be a better fit.

 

Of course, depending on what the wizards actually did, their influence could still have spread Harad...

I for one am intrigued by the sound of this quest. I think it sounds like a lot of fun.

The art on that side quest is beautiful! Can't wait for all of these new side quests to come out.

I also think it's interesting we're getting harad allies... I wonder if this means we could get wose allies in the future! I'm guessing since this cycle ends in Gondor, we may end up going east after this, perhaps even into mordor. That would be fun!

Given the fact that the one Harad ally they've shown us makes other Harad allies cheaper, maybe Harad will give us more expensive, powerful allies that you only include a few of, rather than swarms like Outlands.

It is funny you mention Mordor  for the next cycle...Though I think the game has a bright and long future; I've always kind of secretly thought that they would save Mordor as the setting for the final cycle so it made me involuntarily cringe a bit to read your post about going there in the next cycle!

Well, having played Cross-roads a lot lately, I can now think of a situation where the effect of Coney is advantageous to Feint, but it is a very rare instance in which the enemy attacks after it engages, and then again normally. So, in this particular case, Coney does prevent both attacks. So against those enemies that tend to strike as they engage, this is a good card, but in general, quite inferior to Feint with some requirement.

 

I do hope the traits (especially Warrior, Ranger, Scout and Noble (or Healer)) get developed a lot more over the next cycle. The previewed attachment could suggest that but it has been a very, very slow process thus far.

Given the fact that we'll get a corsair hero, I think it's pretty probable to receive a harad hero as well.

1) I also think it sounds a fun quest. I don't see anything wrong with having something a bit lighter - there are plenty of serious scenarios out there.

 

2) I hope they sail into the West for the last quest.

By "sail into the West," do you mean "leave Middle Earth"?  Because chronologically, all these quests take place before The Lord of the Rings, so...

I think you mean during. But, well, we know what you mean and what are semantics between friends?

You are correct.  I should have said, "in the decades in the very beginning of The Lord of the Rings before Frodo actively set out to leave the Shire".

I do mean leave Middle Earth. Any Elvish heroes could leave at any time of course, but I see no reason why all the other heroes couldn't get dispensation as did Gimli, Bilbo, Frodo, Sam etc. I also don't see why they couldn't leave before LoTR; obviously Fellowship Heroes couldn't leave but the FFG created one's could.

If they begin to develop the Craftsman trait without developing the Artifact trait, I'l personally travel to Minnesotta to burn down FFG's HQ's Sahír style.

Why would they want to? Middle Earth is a cool and good place to live, and all their friends are there.

Well, Bilbo, Frodo, and Sam were allowed that honor due to having been Ringbearers, and Gimli went out of friendship with Legolas.

 

What have the heroes really done that would justify inclusion on the Elvish ships, or indeed, why would they even have the desire to leave Middle Earth permanently?  If most heroes were elves, I could see this, maybe, but a large percentage of heroes are people who would still have concerns in Middle Earth and be unlikely to want to abandon them.

 

I suppose the heroes could forgo the Elvish ships and try to find the Straight Road themselves, without the grace of the Valar, but that doesn't seem terribly heroic, and it's unlikely to end well...

What do you mean "what have they done"? The poor so and so's haven't stopped! They've captured Gollum, passed through Moria, helped save Gondor and Arnor, done some stuff for Saruman (taken for fools on that one, but you can't blame them for that)! And that's before you even look at the single adventures such as saving Osgiliath (again)!

 

Why would anyone want to go to heaven?

 

Immortality

Curiosity - one last adventure

Landscape of utter beauty

Easy lifestyle and wonderful weather (it never rains in Valinor you know!)

Elf maidens/hunks feeding you with grapes

All material needs provided for

Knees stop aching

Not to mention all that heroes in Middle Earth have to look forward to is disease, decrepitude, dementia and death. Probably taxes as well!

Common misconception, and pretty much the same one the Numenorians had.  The West isn't Heaven, and it doesn't grant immortality to people who aren't already immortal (in fact, mortals actually seem to "burn out" quicker there, though there certainly is wholesomeness and mending).  Elves and Valar live in Valinor, and it's called "The Undying Lands" simply because such undying people live there.  Men, even if they were allowed to go to Valinor, would still eventually die and pass beyond the circles of the world, to a fate even the Valar know not.

 

Not really sure where the ideas of an easy lifestyle, elves feeding you with grapes, or all material needs provided for come from, either...

Sorry if it comes as somewhat of a disappointment; I know it was for me when I first found out.  Though in time, I realized it actually made Tolkien's world that much deeper and interesting.

 

Not sure about ending the game that way, but maybe the last Saga expansion will end at the Grey (Gray?) Havens.

That seems unlikely. There are three scenarios per saga expansion, and the important story beats are pretty obvious (Tower of Cirith Ungol, the Cracks of Doom, and the Scouring of the Shire). I'm can't really see them going any other way, unless they break with tradition and add an extra scenario as a final send-off to the saga.

Well, I figured it'd be more or less part of the Scouring of the Shire quest, as a finishing point, story-wise.  I can't really imagine an entire quest devoted just to taking Frodo to the Havens and seeing him off.

 

Each character gains "Action:  Exhaust this character to 'wave good-bye to Frodo' (put a progress token on this character)."  If every character has waved good-bye, the players win the game.

 

Yeah...I'm not sure it really fits the theme of the game...

I still think the Saga should have Cirith Ungol, Gorgoroth, and a mega-quest combining Orodruin and the Morannon. The Scouring is a nice POD Fellowship, I feel.

Whereas I'd rather them combine Cirith Ungol and Gorgoroth, and include Scouring in the Saga.

Christ, you know I didn't even see them until I read your comment.

Had to click back and check it out.

I just saw trees I guess the first time.

 

 

Anyway, bit late to the party, but I like the spoiled cards. Specially coney in a trap. That's going straight into my legolas-haldir deck!

 

I also find the Mumak hunting idea fresh & different from orc hunting.

And it's not strange that they created a whole quest based on the mumakil.

There's not much lore to go on in Harad.

> Is Coney in the Trap a bit disappointing? Altogether, it is a bit worse than Feint, right? Because you can only prevent the enemy from attacking on the round it engages you. I cannot think of any advantages it has over Feint. So, even though it is still nice to have such a card in Lore, I would think with the requirement (and it is not very common to have both a ranger and warrior in a deck -- though not quite rare, either), the card could have cost 0, because I think most of the decks that do have a warrior and ranger might feature Tactics and thus have access to Feint. What do others think?

it's also limited to 'you' whereas Feint can target anything, but i would say that since it's Lore, you can't really compare them directly, but also a christmas deck could run both and have even more options for preventing enemy attacks

as for the cost, i think it's fine. 0 cost would make it too powerful imo, and sure, not many decks have those characters, but these cards are trying to encourage that exploration.

When I get access to the cards I'm actually very interested in making a "Trap" deck and it looks like Coney in the Trap would be a great card to have.

I'm disappointed by Dwarf pipe.  Spices up the mining deck a little bit, but not in a significant way.  I was also hoping it would synergize with Hobbit Pipe, but I'm not seeing any potential there.

I also like the Dunedain ally.  Simple effect and synergizes nicely with the Dunedain archtype.

I dunno, I'm kind of excited about recycling Hidden Cache reliably. Combined with some effect that shuffles your deck it could be pretty exciting.

So do we have enough Harad allies to make Kahliel worth it yet? His ability is very ally-focused, but we only have 3 unique Harad allies so far so I'm not sure he's actually ready to pull his own weight yet.

I was expecting this pack to be Harad-in-a-box like Steward's Fear, but with just the three we have the spoiled cost-reducer may still come in handy.

I don't think we have enough to have a "Harad deck" per-se, but the few Harad allies we have are certainly powerful.  While they're all unique, with Khaliel's ability that's not a terrible problem.  Firyal in particular will be awesome in solo one-handed.

I have no doubt that the allies in this pack will be useful immediately, they're awesome! I'm just not so sure about Kahliel and his headdress... Why choose him over, say, Faramir and Visionary Leadership?

Without more Harad allies, I'm not sure he's a great choice right now.

## 90 [dalestephenson on January 30, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/227249-the-m%C3%BBmakil/?do=findComment&comment=2616963)

More Harad allies will certainly help Khaliel, and the headdress is expensive too.  I'd rate LeFaramir as the more powerful hero.  However, if we posit a deck that has the three unique Harad allies and no questing Gondor allies, Khamiliel has a few advantages over LeFaramir:

1) The 3-cost for the headdress is comparable cost to 2-cost-plus-resource-in-hand for Visionary Leadership, and it'll boost Khaliel and Firyal, not just Faramir.  It also lets Khaliel recycle his discarded allies.

2) Khaliels discard ability lets you do 3x for the Harad allies without them clogging your hand

3) Khaliel can help pay for those three allies.  Faramir can't.

4) Khaliel's readying ability is more costly to ready, but has two important advantages -- he can do it *during* the combat phase, and he can use it to ready himself.  There are allies that benefit tremendously from Faramir's readying ability, but I don't think the three Haradrim really do, given the timing.

5) Khaliel can play with ally Faramir, who rocks.

In short, I think Khaliel is better than Faramir for working with the Harad allies, and he's one threat cost cheaper to boot.  The problem of course is that with few Haradrim, you'll probably want some other allies as well, and LeFaramir can ready any of *them* as well.  OTOH, if it's a low-character hero-based build, maybe Khaliel's already the best fit for that deck.

At this point, I don't think Khaliel is a great hero and maybe not a good one, but I think the few Haradrim are good enough that he's at least a playable hero.  He'll get better with more Haradrim -- if there's enough Haradrim by the end of the cycle to make an actual "Harad deck", he'll be a staple for that type.  We know one more is coming, but that may not be enough.

I do think an Elrond/Khaliel/three-Haradrim strider build might be interesting :) [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/uploads/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I'm sure he'll be the only Harad hero (otherwise the headdress wouldn't have his name on it) and I'd be surprised if there were any more Harad allies after this cycle is done.  The question is how many unspoiled Harad allies are still coming this cycle.  Could be as few as zero.

Oh I somehow missed that Kahliel can ready himself, that does up his usefulness a bit more. Still not convinced about him, but I think I'll give him a try and find out.

Here's to hoping we get some more Harad allies in the other packs though.

Yeah fairly unenthused by the last few player spoilers for this pack... Dwarf Pipe is next to useless and the guardsman is great but has crappy stats, I'd much prefer that he had 1 attack and 1 hitpoint over 2 hitpoints or over that complete waste of 1 defense. Idk I guess his ability is pretty **** good considering its only a single resource more than feint and gives you a body at the same time.. just really wish he had a point of attack...

Yazan while awesome is not very exciting as we knew we would get him at some point anyway. Other than Yazan and MAYBE Firyal not really much of a fan of the Haradrim player cards and don't plan on using them any time soon (again except for Yazan or Firyal). Couldn't agree more with those saying the art on Coney in a Trap is awful but I actually dislike the art on Wait No Longer even more for some reason. I can see that it definitely has great potential but I feel like the awful art is contributing strongly to my disinterest in this card.
Also correct me if I'm wrong but isn't it sort of just a tactics version of Gildor's Counsel that costs one less, fetches an enemy and can be utizilised in Solo? Considering I never play solo and strictly play two handed I'd much rather pay a single extra lore resource to face one card less during staging without having to fetch an enemy and putting it into play engaged with me. Then again there is the whole gaining of resources and various other effects (questing free, discount allies) when enemies engage/are engaged in the Dunedain trait etc. I guess it could be great in Dunedain or engagement decks but yeah idk it just doesn't jump out at me. The only player card I do find somewhat exciting is the new side quest but everyone seems to think it is rather average. I totally see that point of view and agree somewhat but if you do get lucky enough to draw and clear it within the first few turns it could potentially be really powerful especially with the upcoming Thurindir who guarantees you can have it in your starting hand if you wish).

Sorry for being so negative just not the most exciting pack for me. I am looking forward to putting Yazan to work though and reckon he will be a very strong addition to my decks.
The quest itself looks pretty **** cool, some of the animals and wildlife we are fighting are fairly interesting choices though....

If you never play one-handed solo, I can see where Wait No Longer seems weak besides Gildor's Counsel.  If you play one-handed solo, Gildor's Counsel is useless and Wait No Longer is all kinds of awesome.  Even without Mablung or a Dunedain deck, getting an enemy of your choice engaged is a small price to play for revealing zero cards from the deck.  It's easy to make quest progress with no reveal.

Of Yazan, Firyal, and Jubayr, I like Yazan the least.  One point of direct damage, after the enemy attacks, just isn't that exciting to me.  2wp and 3 attack are solid, but for five it ought to be.  Firyal's ability I like a lot, the ability to scry/discard isn't as timely as Denethor's similar ability, though it has the advantage of discarding a nasty card instead of saving it for later.  Jubayr may not be a useful to decks with a dedicated hero defender, but for ally defense it doesn't get any better than built-in shadow *discard* -- with that feature, 3/3 defense is plenty good for most non-unique enemies.

Dwarf Pipe is disappointing, since it's really only marginally useful in a mining deck.  It's not right that the Hobbit Pipe is both better and cheaper -- if Dwarf Pipe cost 0 it would at least be useful for the pipe events.

The new pipe is funny because when you discard Ered Luin Miner and put him directly into play, you can then say "sorry bud" and immediately move him to the bottom of your deck.

Just picked up my pack and sleeved it.  Play will have to wait until tonight.  It's DL4 fwiw.  Also I see I need to fit a couple of Powers of Orthanc back into my deck.

I used Dwarf Pipe to great effect in a dwarf/noldor deck last night. Not only does it allow you greater control over the card type of the top card in your discard pile (so the noldor allies from The Grey Havens can get their respective boosts when you need them), it also allows you to recur Hidden Cache. You need a way to mine down to the bottom of your deck, or a way to shuffle your deck, both of which are pretty easy to do with the current card pool. When you only have two copies of hidden cache and a copy of Lords of the Eldar in your deck, you basically win. :-)

Curious quest. I  figured there would be some  mechanic which forces a Mumakil into play at the last stage, but there isn't.  I beat the quest without ever facing one.

I think DL4 is about right.

You might want to revisit the quest...

3/3 in legit play throughs.  Don't think this one is going to top eight the quest championship anytime soon.  Maybe it shines in multi-player?

Then, how do you advance to the 2A quest if I am playing on my own (solo) and the number of Mumakils is more than 1. I can´´t kill any cuz they are indestructible. Thanks... Shouldn the card say: "equal or more"?

Hmmm, it does seem like it would be impossible to advance unless you manage to get 12 progress before the 2nd Mumak shows up. You are probably right that "equal or more" was their intention.

There are no rules that limit the amount of Mumaks in the game to the number of players?

Not that I can tell.

Quest Stage 1A:  Setup: Set each copy of Wild Mûmak and each Capture objective aside, out of play. Each player adds 1 different location to the staging area. Shuffle the encounter deck.

## 113 [donkler on February 9, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/227249-the-m%C3%BBmakil/?do=findComment&comment=2633218)

Also on Quest Stage 2A: When Revealed: Starting with the first player, each player attaches 1 random set-aside Capture objective to a Wild Mûmak in play.

It seems like you could attach multiple capture objectives to the same Mumak? So when you complete one of them, it and the Mumak get added to the victory display, but the other remaining objectives would sit unattached in someone's staging area and create an unwinnable game state.
