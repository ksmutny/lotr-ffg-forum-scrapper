Hi guys, just a quick question.

I play the german version so I´ll try to translate the card´s text the way I understand it:

 

The card "Golum" reads: "At the end of the turn increase your thread by 3 if you hold Golum captured".

 

Does that mean, I have to increase my thread by 4 (1 during the refresh phase and an additional 3 for Golum) or does increasing thread by 3 replace the normal 1 during the refreshphase?

 

Thanks a lot!

 

Quite a nasty quest for a solo game, at least when I increased my thread by 4.

You must increase your threat by the usual 1 and then an extra 3. It's a hard quest solo, and one that loses some of the theme as well.

Thank you!

What do you mean by saying "it loses some of the theme as well"?

Yes, it's a total of 4 threat raise. I recommend playing 2-handed for this quest so you can bounce Gollum around (and stage 3 is also becomes less of a nightmare), but if you really want to do it solo, you could try including Elfhelm - he reduces the threat raise by 1 each turn.

With more than one player, Gollum tends to get passed around a lot, and working out when to pass him is an important part of the quest.

I guess I will skip that quest for a gaming night with some friends soon.

Most of the quests of this cycle seemed easier in solo mode, but that last one is clearly made for a group.

While it is very challenging, it is beatable solo. I've done it "progression style," i.e., using only the cards available at the time the scenario was first released (so basically only cards from the Core set and the Mirkwood cycle).
