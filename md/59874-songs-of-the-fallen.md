Can someone point me at the rules for this one please?

If a hero is discarded, is it considered dead?

i.e. If Boromir uses his "Action: Discard Boromir .....", or if Glorfindal heals Wilyador and is discarded, or a Khazad Dum shadow effect causes a hero to be discarded, are these mighty heroes considered "dead" when it comes to scoring at the end of the game?

Nope, they're just discarded/removed from the game.  They're only dead/defeated/destroyed if they take damage equal to their hit points.

Can you point me at the rules/errata to confirm that please? I haven't been able to find anything myself.

The rules talk about "defeated" (when a character has damage counters on it equal to its hit points), but I've not found anything that actually defines death.

i would have said boromir's self sacrifice ability would be seen as death, but im not sure if the rules state that or not

 "Dead" is not a term that is explicity defined in the rulebook or the errata/FAQ.

Since there doesn't seem to be a definitive answer in the rulebook, can someone please let me know how I ask Nate for an official definition?

Something like: A Hero is considered to be dead for scoring purposes if it is not in play when the game ends.

 You need to click on the "Rules Questions" link at the very bottom of the page.  And I mean the VERY bottom of the page.

The answer from Nate.

Any hero that was used in the game, but is not in play at the end of the game, should be considered "dead" for scoring purposes.

I can not believe this even needed to be asked.. Still, added it to the "official Nate Response Thread @ CardGameDB [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/index.php?/topic/1702-official-nate-rule-clarifications-updated-27012012/page__view__findpost__p__4134]"

 Ah, that is good to know.  This changes the way I did things: For example, I wouldn't have counted Glorfindel against my score after healing Wilyador.  But now I suppose that is what needs to be done. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Sad, but true.  Although Nate's clarification is significantly easier to administer, so I don't mind. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
