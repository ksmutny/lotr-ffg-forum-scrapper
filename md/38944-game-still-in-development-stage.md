I remember this game being announced before GenCon, and of course saw the demo being played at GenCon itself, but the upcoming page still has this listed as "in development". This begs the questions, "when will it really be released?" and why was in announced/demonstrated while still not fully develped?" Is the upcoming page in error?

Also, I really hope this game will feature at least some non-digital art.

Didn't you see the article about the game being late because the first run of minis had some issues? The game itself (rules, etc.) seems to be finished.

Huh?

The only minis-gone-bad news I remember lately came from Mansions of Madness:

Doh, I thought I was in a different forum - nevermind! sorpresa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sorpresa.gif]

Regarding the LotR: Translation started at the end of last week. I don't think, they'd start translating it if it wasn't finished yet.

The expected release date is Feb/March 2011 (for the English and international versions alike) - This has been confirmed by various sources across the world.
