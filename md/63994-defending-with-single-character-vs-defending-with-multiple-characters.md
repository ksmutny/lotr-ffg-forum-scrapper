Hey all

Just started playing the core set, so I am very green.

My question - obviously - is on the clarification of the benefits of assigning multiple defenders via the "Stand Together" event card.

How does it work?

Do I assign damage to my advantage?

 You can assign multiple defenders to all attacks against you that round; you must assign damage from the enemy to a single defender, however.

What would be the advantage then to assigning multiple defenders?

If this is the case, then I see no advantage.

Defenders add up their defense, then compare against attack. Dain (def 3) and Gimli (def 2) together for example would only take 1 dmg from a Hill Troll (barring Shadow Effect boost) vs 3 or 4 they would take individually.

Interesting note though, Stand Together vs Sudden Pitfall: Would you only discard 1 of the defending characters or all of them?

Sudden Pitfall's shadow effect only references a singular "defending character," so I think you would choose and discard one of the defenders. Admittedly, Stand Together is a bit of a corner case, but Sudden Pitfall notably does NOT instruct a player to "discard ALL defending characters." As such, literal interpretation would support the idea of a single discard.

Then again, the norm is to only have a single defending character, would be a bit odd if they took Stand Together (as the lone card expection to this) into consideration in the wording of Sudden Pitfall. Had they worded it "discard defending characters from play", people would've been like A) what, all defenders everywhere or B) how can you have multiple defenders. SP is already quite a "screw you" card, wouldn't surprise me if you had to toss all the defenders.

That makes sense. Thanks!
