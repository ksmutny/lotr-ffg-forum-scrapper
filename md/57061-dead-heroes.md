When a Hero is killed the rules seem to suggest that the Hero is put into the Discard Pile. If this is the case, how does this work with Will of The West? Does the Hero shuffle back into the deck?

If so how do you play the Hero again once you draw him / her? If not what would be a good way to change the wording when it comes to Dead Heroes.

On page 20 of the rulebook it states,"Defeated characters are placed in their owner's discard pile... Note that hero cards that are defeated are placed in their owner's discard pile.  When resolving effects that move cards from a player's discard pile to his hand or deck, hero cards in the discard pile are ignored, as hero cards cannot move to a player's hand or deck."

Thanks a lot!

I've kinda forgot all about the rulebook ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]
