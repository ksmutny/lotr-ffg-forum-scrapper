I was wondering if there's an official ruling for using Beorn's +5 attack ability after you used sneak attack to get him in play as to where he ends up. I'm assiming that because you use Beorn's ability after sneak attack it resolves and shuffles him back into your library rather than back into your hand. The couple of times I've sneak attacked him and then used his ability this is how I've played. Just wanted to see if there was a ruling for this though =)

It's in the FAQ under "simultaneous effect timing," and they use Beorn + Sneak Attack as an example:

 

(1.02) Simultaneous Effect Timing
If two or more conflicting effects would occur
simultaneously, the first player decides the order in
which the effects resolve.
Example: Tom plays Sneak Attack (CORE 23) to
put Beorn (CORE 31) into play during the combat
phase. Sneak Effect has the condition, “At the end of
the phase, if that ally is still in play, return it to your
hand.” During combat, Tom uses Beorn’s triggered
effect, which has the condition, “At the end of the
phase in which you trigger this effect, shuffle Beorn
back into your deck.” At the end of the phase, a
situation arises in which two conflicting effects are
attempting to resolve simultaneously on Beorn. The
first player determines which of the two effects resolves
first. (The second effect no longer applies when Beorn
leaves play.)

Wow..

Thats pretty crazy that you can choose, don't get me wrong it makes sense but just makes sneak attack + beorn very powerful.

Thanks Grandspleen!

no more that sneak + gandaf. Sneak-Beon is one of the best moves the game had for a long time

After 1 year i return back this post.

 

I'm still not sure if Beorn return to hand instead to deck. FAQ is not totally 100% clear.

My doubt returns to start from the discuss about Staff Gandalf + cancel shadow effects with +X attack enemy. The effect of shadow card continues even if it is discarded. So the effect of Beorn is still open despite he would return to hand by sneak-attack effect.

If you chose Beorn effect first:

-1- Beorn goes to deck

-2- Sneak attacks has no effect because Beorn is not in game

If you chose SA first:

-1- Beorn goes to hand by SA effect

-2- Beorn goes to discard by his own effect

 

Do i miss something, then?

The case with shadow cards is that they're like events - it doesn't matter where the card is, because once you turn it over it resolves, changing the game state in some way. Discarding it makes no difference because the effect has already happened.

By contrast, Beorn is not an event, he's an ally, and his text is only active while he's in play.
