Hi folks,

 

Now, to make it short. The only thing Hobbits have but which is turely a great "weapon" in the books, is WILLPOWER. Now, why the hell is that that low??? I mean, I love Hobbits! And they should have a super ultra high willpower, much higher than Eowen. I mean they can resist Sauron, they save Middle Earth.


What do you think?

We also need some stuff  to really improve Hobbits.

I vote for full eradication. It's the only way to be sure gran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif] .

Yes, I HATE hobbits.

However, hobbits are not known for their love of questing, nor fighting. However they are resilient and clever (not to mention lucky). I like the card drawing aspect (luck) as well as the resilience that allows Frodo to add threats rather than die.  I do agree however that there should (in the future) be better card support for the hobbits. And I do believe that in time there will be awesome card support for hobbits and their incredible talents.

Personally I'd just like to see more boosts to willpower in the game.

Actually during the movies both Sam and Frodo went through some pouting spells where they wanted to quit, so 2 WP seems fine. Eowyn having 4 is a little odd, but apparently she could have worn the ring as a wedding band and been cool with it.

There may be more in store for the Hobbits than we can see now.  Perhaps an option for a Hobbit deck with lower threat and a TON of tricks and sneaky things that allow them to dodge the encounter deck.  I personally think Bilbo should be a lower threat, but I will hold back my critiques until the first big box releases.

 I agree with the OP, the Willpower on Bilbo and Frodo has seemed oddly low. They were both archetypal when it comes to the "reluctant hero", but both were beyond essential to the quests that they undertook. 

I would love them as Hero cards with +1 Willpower for each of them.
