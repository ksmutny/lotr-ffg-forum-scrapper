With a limited amount of news about the expansion's release date or whatever, I am to post about one of the cards which value I strongly underestimated at first.

Building a deck whilst including only one or two Gondor characters I felt like the inclusion of For Gondor! was a waste. One day I tried it on and never pulled back. I am really happy any time I draw this card now. Even when you don't have Gondor characters, the effect grows in power the more characters you have, of course. It is a must in a multiplayer game I say. When we play as a 3 player group, having usually 2 Gondor heroes (plus the possibility of an ally and Steward of Gondor which gives the trait), For Gondor! can really turn the tables. It only gets better as many of the Gondor characters are made to defend, Denethor, Eleanor, Faramir, they are bound to never quest and wait to either defend or use their ability after the commitment to quest is over. I really enjoy this about the game mechanics, not to mention that all the mentioned characters have high defensive values (Denethor being master of defense). And there is also Gondorian Spearman (who I don't play but who also makes sense in the combo with this great event card).

Gondor is building up for some nation-oriented deck. With both Boromir and Imrahil supposedly coming in the first expansion cycle, I can only hope for more greatness and celebration of Gondorian culture in this great game.
