It's annoying to see a LOTR LCG article on the front page only to find out it's about the digital app. Obviously the two names are are not the same (LotR: The Card Game vs LotR: The Living Card Game). Aside from that the two games are distinctly different in how they play. I am also thinking that this confusion might discourage new players from discovering the paper game if they were first introduced to the digital one and didn't like it (see the mixed reviews on the steam page). 

Would it be too much to create a distinct tag for the digital app? It's a completely different game.
