I was making a deck in RingsDB. Not a normal deck, but a deck with one copy of each player card in the game (excluding boons and treasures), just to see how much there are. I can't publish it because it says: "Contains too many copies of a card (by title)".

I searched the deck and I obviously found two Gandalfs, Bofurs and Anborns but that isn't ilegal. I dont believe there too much player cards since the deck has got less than 500 cards on it and Seastan's Horn of Gondor combo deck has got more than 80.

I don't know what to do...

Do you have allies that match your heroes?

It's bound to be something like that... If you're adding every card in the game, there are very few heroes who also haven't got an ally version (maybe if you combined Beravor, Eleanor and Brand son of Bain). I also encountered that today, when I tried to add Elrond ally to a deck with an Elrond hero... only caught my mistake after staring at it for about ten minutes!

Do you think they should start making ally versions of FFG-created heroes?

I for one would like that; I love expensive unique allies.

The hero is Erestor, just for fun because "he made a list of the cards i the game"☺.

So do you have the Erestor ally in your deck?

The deck was inmediately legal when I swapped Beravor for Erestor. Thanks guys!

It's not illegal to have an ally in your deck with the same name as a hero, so if it prevents you from publishing the deck I think this should be fixed.

It's also not illegal to have a deck with a copy of Tactics Bofur and Spirit Bofur, either.

That's not throwing up any errors for me, as long as there aren't more than 3 in total.
