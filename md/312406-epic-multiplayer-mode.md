Hey all,

I am considering getting the pieces for all the epic multiplayer quests.

We just welcomed our third child a few weeks ago and with this game seemingly going the way of the dodo bird, I was thinking of trying to complete my quest collection so that some day my kids and I can gather around the gaming table and play some quests!

I know certain quests need more than one copy of the game. Does anyone know all the quests that can be played EMP style? Also, what pieces/copies are needed for each?

Finally, does EMP make an exception to the uniqueness rule?

From memory Mount Doom/Black Gate Opens, Attack on Dol Goldur, Siege of Annuminas and the new unreleased Dreadnaught quest. Also you could make a case for the build your own/competitive scenarios being up to 8 players

Do you need 3 copies of each besides black gate?

For the build your own competitive you’d need at least two copies and for the other two yes three copies to hahe big enough encounter cards.
