I finally beat Confict at the Carock!!!!  It took forever but i finally found a deck combination that worked for me! Heros: Gimli - Key is to get Armor on him so you can get him wounded and pissed off. The more wounds the more damage he does. Denethor - Lets you peek at the top card of the encounter deck and you get to decide wether or not to face it. Glorfindel - Helps to keep characters healed - Last he isn't a Hero, but if you are able to pull him early, you can use Radagast to help with resource tokens to call in the add of the Eagles!!!!

I am soooo I excited that I finally beat the 4 nasty Trolls on the stupid Carock!!! gran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif]

Am I correct in thinking that this was Solo? Can you post your deck list?

 I haven't gotten close to victory yet, either solo or two-player. I also haven't tried to build any decks especially intended to beat it either though.

Odd, I rate Carrock as the second easiest quest currently, only Mirkwood is easier and even then it's only just a feeling, Mirkwood at least has direct damage stuff that is utterly lacking from Carrock. 7-0 against Carrock in 2-player/deck games, using the standard four decks I have, they aren't min-maxed that much by any real sense of the word. Hell, each deck has 55 cards.
