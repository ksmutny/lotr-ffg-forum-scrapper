# [Why 2 core sets for 3-4-player games? ](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85438-why-2-core-sets-for-3-4-player-games/)

The instructions say that you need 2 core sets to be 3 players or more. But as the core set comes with 4 standard decks, what's really stopping you from playing with up to 3 friends? Is it something about needing at least 50 cards for a "tournament legal" deck?

its got more to do with the fact you only have 2 threat dials and limited damage etc. icons

you can play 3-4 with 1 core set…

-write threat on paper

-use proxy icons

-you will also have to have a limited deck building options until you either get another or have more expansions

….not completely how its meant to work, but it certainly can work, and its worth trying until you can get another set

Yeah, that's what I was thinking. I just got Khazad-Dûm and a few adventure packs anyway, but it's good to know that you can do a 4-player game even without 2 core sets if you're not afraid to use pen and paper.
