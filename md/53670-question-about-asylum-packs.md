So, What is the deal with the LOTR packs?

What exacly has been released already? It confuses me the way they list products that are not in fact out yet.

Hunt for Gollum, Conflict at the Carrock, and Journey to Rhosgobel are out already. Hills of Emyn Muil is coming very soon. The others should come 1 a month after that.
