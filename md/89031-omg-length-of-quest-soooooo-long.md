So my buddy got back from Gen Con with Black Riders. He was volunteering the entire time so he didn't have time to sit down and play through the new scenarios while he was there, thus it was the first time for all three of us when we sat down to enjoy a nice evening of Lotr Lcg ... in the middle of the week.... at 9 o'clock.

 

 

So after debating extensively about what decks we were using we got started and promptly died quickly twice in a row. Good time. Gave us a taste for the quest. So we paused, modified 2 decks, and proceeded to really give the 2nd Blackriders quest one more run for its money before going to bed to get ready for work in the morning.

 

Two and a half + hours later.... We finally won! 

What an epic quest... SUPER COOL and I am suuuuuper tired today.

Looks like Black Riders is the boat!

How many rounds was it? I played Reborn Gate in 25 rounds once. Decked out both decks and went through the encounter deck two full times before I got the necessary victory points.

I'm not sure. We were very tired by the end of it we went through the encounter deck at least four times but that's not saying much. Some effects make you discard until you get so many of some card type.

I actually lost by threat to spiders of mirkwood because we simply could not get ungolianth to show up normally no matter how many times we blew through the encounter deck.

I don't understand. Any time that you NEED Ungoliant Spawn, it allows you to fetch it from the deck/discard.

??? Not that I'm aware of. It gives you the chance to pull a number of spider enemies out equal to the number of players and only once. I was teaching someone to play at the time and we bypassed the option to pull Ungolianths Spawn and selected another spider in its place so he could contine past turn two or three and get a good taste of the game. Of course... after another turn or two we were ready to take her down but she never showed up again

Well that's the "fetch" he's referring to; if you don't grab Ungoliant's Spawn at that opportunity I think it's kind of missing the point...or at least putting your chances of passing at severe risk

You seem to be missing the point.

Normally is happen when you dont know the game well. When you already know ho to play and build up the decks you past it more quickly. You lucky! i want t get this feeling back. For me is everything in game now so easy and boring except NM.

It sounds like you need a break from the game Glaurung. I love Pepsi but if all I drink is Pepsi it tastes terrible. Go play some football for a week and maybe the game will regain some of its fizz for you. I have been playing since this game debuted and I still enjoy myself
