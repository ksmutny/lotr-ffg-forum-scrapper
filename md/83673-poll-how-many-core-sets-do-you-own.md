I have 1.  I NEVER plan on buying another core set just for 6 cards.  I'd rather buy 2-3 expansions with that money.  Since I'm only a solo or two handed player I dont see a need in buying another one.

I have 1 core set. Seems like way too much money for just a few extra cards, but I can appreciate that some would want access to the full card pool.

Rich,

I play with three core sets, but that's largely due to my son and I sharing those cards.  He usually runs a duo sphere leadership/tactics Dwarf deck, and I run spirit/lore.  On occassion, when I want to play solo, I run a separate solo deck for myself.  So, that's more cards, and I plan on dipping into the tactics leadership cards at some point as well.  But, even if I didn't have those excuses, it would still come down to having the resources to procure Unexpected Courage (times 3), and I gladly would.

thanks Brian. i will probably buy a 2nd set soon. as a solo player i probably wouldnt but since starting to play 2, and more recently, 3 - handed, i feel that even the cards that you get 3 of in the core set are worth getting again, so each deck can have them in if you field that particular sphere in both decks

I own one.

 

If I ever see another one going for cheap enough, I might pick it up though.  As much for the Threat Trackers and tokens as for the cards though.

I will be heading up a LOTR LCG league for my not-so-local gaming store.  So, having three core sets will really help me out with new players.  I can have three quests going at once with 2-players each.  I am thinking of having pre-made monosphere decks for everyone to start out with, so they can get used to the game and how the different spheres vary.  Any ideas from folks who are in leagues?

6 core sets at this moment and counting…

12 would be optimum, but there is still long way to go there ;-)

i got 3 sets when i began playing, but now i only play with a maximum of 1 of each card in my decks, so that turned out to be a waste of time… :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

but at least i got to make up each of the quests in full, without having to swap all the encounter decks around every time. so im still glad i got 3

A friend gave me one as a gift and since my wife also plays I bought a second one. I ended up with a third one after we realized that 2 decks with 3 tests of will and 3 hasty strokes was better.

Hi RIch

I own 3 sets but mainly due to my son  and I playing the game so share the cards. It's even been known for my wife and daughter to join in as well, so the extra threat trackers come in handy.

just 1

as much a i want more copies of some of the limited cards from the core set like unexpected courage, steward of gondor, horn of gondor, etc.  I just cant justify buying a whole new box for a handful of cards with tons of extras i'll never need nor use…especially the encounter cards

its not like i could even give the extra player cards and encounter cards to a friend because i would be cheating them out of the best cards in the box.

Two core sets. Do to the fact I play with all sleeved cards, I was going to print and paste the cards I didn't have. I found, however, that I didn't really need to. The only Card I consistantly wish I had three/six of is Unexpected Courage. I limp along with two…

Two. 

Preordered from one place, then saw that another store already had it. Bought it there and canceled the pre-order, but got it anyway and kept it.

Um, I've so far bought four, though have only kept the player cards from three to make 3x of everything. Not that I then put 3x Unexpected Courage into my deck of the day - I actually bought four so I could have all of the core set and Mirkwood scenarios set up at the same time (because I'm lazy). I still need a fifth to have Dol Guldur set up, though as I find that too difficult I never play it, so the 'need' for that fifth is debatable to say the least.

For 4 player, yes! We like to play this game in big groups! It is great fun, but the difficulty means you have to have 3 Test of Will in every deck… so 6 core is minimum ;-)

Two core sets.

I only recently bought the second one after catching up with all the expansions available up to that point (NIghtmare packs excepted).  Prior to that I proxied 2nd/3rd copies of cards where I wanted them for decks - and I still do so for a 3rd copy of Unexpected Courage.
