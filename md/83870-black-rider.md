Agreed, so much good stuff, the designers are on fire.

So f.cking excited!!! But may I add we will see some new characters from the books, such as Tom Bombandil, Barliman, etc. But who do you guys think are the 4 hobbit heroes (Frodo is counted as neutral hero)?

 

## 5 [richsabre on May 14, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83870-black-rider/?do=findComment&comment=795501)

fatty for sure will be one

## 6 [Raven1015 on May 14, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83870-black-rider/?do=findComment&comment=795502)

Most likely Sam, Merry, and another version of Pippin.

Can't figure out the fourth hero though? Fatty Bolger? Farmer Maggot? Maybe another version of Bilbo?

## 7 [CJMatos on May 14, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83870-black-rider/?do=findComment&comment=795509)

Not Bilbo… Merry, Sam, Fatty and some other… Hamfast?

 

 

Frodo will function as Bilbo did for the Hobbit saga…

It is another sphere…

 

 

Edit: Strange… 

 

Black Rider is put under Deluxe expansion (khazad-dum and HoN) and not under Saga expansion (Hobbit) on the Lord of the Rings Products page…

## 8 [Ellareth on May 14, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83870-black-rider/?do=findComment&comment=795515)

Lots of things to be excited in this article for sure.

Will be interesting to see how the Hobbit race would be developed to compensate for pre-existing low threat enemies (enemies below 10 threat engagement threshold), and sounds like Ranger traits will be developed along side as well.

Start of this Saga expansion somewhat gurantees atleast 5 more Saga expansions to come, and epic battles of Helm's Deep, Pelenor Fields and such.

 

But I'm not sure if Tom Bombadil and Old Forest will be included in the expansion.
Article says they will stay as true as possible to the book, and does mention something about Frodo slipping from Shire,
but after reading the article I'd guess the 3 scenarios are Bag End to Cracklehollow (include encounter with Gildor and escape in Bukleburry ferry), Bree and Weathertop (include Southerner spies and battle at Weathertop), Weathertop to Rivendell (include encounter with Glorfindel and battle at the Ford of Bruinen).
Of course they could be just teasing us by not mentioning the Old Forest, but it looks like Bombadil and Burrow-wights are being left out. If my guess is correct and they do leave out Old Forest it will be disappointing.

Another thing that is bugging me is the artwork.
Individually, all the artwork on card are very excellent.
But looking at the spoiled cards, the artwork is just everywhere and styles don't match each other.
Some cards look 'pretty', some look 'D&D fantasy', some look 'fairytale-ish', some look 'comicbook-ish', and overall they look like combination of arts from different games. A little of consistency in style of art used would be nice.
 

But yeah, the game seems to be getting better and better with new Easy, Standard, Nightmare Modes, Reward/Punishment for Campaign Mode, and promise of more Saga expansions to come.

 

Assuming we will be finished with Against the Shadow Cycle by the time Black Rider Saga comes out (they said 3rd quarter, which I would assume means september), I'm betting next Cycle will be located around Sarn Ford and focused on Dunedain Ranger / Hobbits to synergize with Saga expasions to develope those keywords further.

Oh my so much amazing things to buy. Now this looks very intresting with the boons and those burdens look nasty. I wonder if there are going to be the 9 nazgul on the box? By the way how many saga expansions do you think the Fellowship will have?

well theres 3 here …so thats 3 in the first book of the fellowship. so another 3 for the 2nd book of the fellowship making.. 2 packs per book, 6 per trilogy?

I'm calling it right now: the Hobbit/Pipe deck will be the next big thing.

Maybe (but probably not) we will get Khamul :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]  This is probably his only chance to be in the game.  But it would make sense for him to be in here as this is were he plays his big part in the books.  We'll have to see. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

Khamul

Khamul



 

I would like to think that Nazgul of Dol Guldur from Escape from Dol Guldur scenario was Khamul, but admitably it could've been other 2 sidekick Nazgul that was with him.
 

Khamul as the unique Nazgul enemy for the first quest would be cool indeed, as he was the one chasing the Hobbits throughout the Shire and he is the only Nazgul named by Tolkien.

## 17 [Gizlivadi on May 14, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83870-black-rider/?do=findComment&comment=795553)

I have no words for this.

Except for HOLY M*THERF*CKING SH*T!!!!!!!

This game keeps getting better and better. So we finally venture into the LOTR novels proper, and this looks like one hell of a saga expansion!!

Too hyped

## 18 [Khamul The Easterling on May 14, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83870-black-rider/?do=findComment&comment=795554)

Yeah I really like Khamul and Haldir because they are kinda not very big and popular characters.  I always like more mysterious things.  I hope we will be able to see both Khamul and Haldir.  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

## 19 [Ozil23 on May 15, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83870-black-rider/?do=findComment&comment=795580)

Ok so after all of this, we can assure that the first part is the shire, hobbits, bree, in summary the journey of Frodo to Rivendell. So do you guys think maybe aragorn could appear as an ally? Or what heroes could come in the 2nd saga? I would suggest maybe the redoing of Gimli, Legolas or a ****** GANDALF, or some elves like Haldir, Galadriel, or maybe celeborn. What do you guys think?

## 20 [Pharmboys2013 on May 15, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83870-black-rider/?do=findComment&comment=795586)

could not be more excited!!!! almost screamed out loud at work when i saw the update on my phone.  it will be so great to make some versatile hobbit decks as well as extremely thematic as well.  Just as a whole, the fact that there will be saga expansions for the entire lord of the rings is just fantastic…soo much to look forward to.

plus the second best part is all the RAMPANT INTERNET SPECULATION!!!!!

preseason predictions:

black rider heroes: bilbo, sam, pippin, & merry (it just makes too much sense otherwise (yes i know we are already getting pippin and possibly another hobbit in this cycle))

saga expansion 2 quests:

1: Passage over the misty mountains

2: Moria and the Balrog

3: Breaking of the fellowship near Rauros Falls

(considering the first 2 quests were kind of already covered in the darrowdelf cycle, maybe the 1st will be moria (they cant avoid it) and the 2nd will be a more original quest about making it to Lothlorien)

saga expansion 2 heroes:

remake of legolas and gimili along with celebron and Galadriel (although it would not surprise me one bit if ANOTHER new araogrn or a hero Haldir showed up…)

This announcement just proves that this game is dying.  Look at the other older LCGs, CoC and W:I, both discontinued their monthly packs to switch to deluxe expansions only distribution mode, and it is viewed as due to those games are dying.

Now they just announce these "big boxes" without news about next cycle of monthly packs after Against the Shadow, so it is an indication that this game is walking down the same road as CoC and W:I.

[/sarcasm off]

I'm so excited about this news!  Together with the Easy Mode, I think FFG and the LotR design team are doing great jobs!

I love the art variety, mostly because I HATE how movies' aesthetic is ruling most artwork related to LotR. We have ton of great art pieces with different styles, from Core Gandalf (I like it much more than Hobbit Gandalf) to Hand Upon the Bow or Many Roads.

StarWars LCG has more consistent art, but it's too plain, nothing really stands out.

I can't wait! As much as I love all the original stories that have come out of the quests so far, there is something ridiculously fun about playing the actual book of The Hobbit, so I'm really looking forward to more of that here! I've always liked the journey to Rivendell from this book, there's something innocent about it that really pleases me. And Weathertop, for a reason I can't quite explain, has long been my favourite location in pretty much the whole saga, so I'm looking forward to that! 

Boons and Burdens sound excellent. Something that pleased me much about The Steward's Fear was the Plots mechanic, which seems to be indicative of more emphasis on story-telling than on just killing stuff. As fun as the treasures were, I didn't think all that much to them in actual gameplay terms. Collecting Boons sounds like a much better idea of showing how your adventure has changed you.

Considering The Hobbit boxes essentially re-made Conflict at the Carrock and Passage through Mirkwood, it wouldn't surprise me to see Moria yet again, issues of the fact it's in the book aside! The Hobbit re-made them better, though, so even though they're the same, essentially, they still feel different enough that I'd have no problem with going back into Moria. I just hope it's the one quest, though, and not given too much focus.

This bugged me about the Hobbit boxes as well. Encounter decks were largely okay, the player cards had some artwork that varied too crazily. It used to be consistently excellent too, so not sure what happened there. 

## 26 [Kcall07 on May 15, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83870-black-rider/?do=findComment&comment=795645)

This is excellent news! I can't wait for this set. I love this part of the book, it's so atmospheric and creepy. No mention of Barrow Wights or the Old Forest though?

This may sound crazy but the other Hobbit hero (after Sam, Merry and Fatty) could be Rosie. A lot of people have been clamouring for more female heroes so its possible.

All the heroes are hobbits, but I wonder if Aragorn, Glorfindel or Gildor will get any specific mention? I know some people have complained that some heroes have received too much attention but I think that Aragorn specifically is one of the few characters in the book that fits perfectly into each sphere. It seems from from all the attachments he was given that the intention was to make him a man of all spheres. I think this was a good idea, I know others disagree.

Having said that Lore Aragorn (artwork and ability) will fit perfectly with this set, and it seems clear from the cards that Rangers may be a specific benefit.

I think two boxes per book is likely, but not certain. It could easily be three. One dealing with the journey over the misty mountains, the other with Lothlorien, Anduin etc. The second fellowship book has so many individual adventures.

New Legolas and Gimli next box? Yes! Maybe Anduril too for Aragorn? A new Gandalf ally or even hero? Galadriel for certain. There is a lot to be excited about. It will be so good to play these adventures accurately, with the full fellowship.

Do people think they will do a cycle inbetween saga instalments, like they did with the hobbit? I.e one per year? I think that would be a good idea personally.

Anyway, brainstorm over.

## 27 [Kcall07 on May 15, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83870-black-rider/?do=findComment&comment=795650)

P.s campaign mode sounds amazing. Imagine playing through the entire story, with previous performance or decisions affecting later quests. The Boons and Burdens sound interesting. It's clear the Burdens are for the encounter deck, but imagine at some point if the game forced you to put bad cards in your own deck? That would be an interesting mechanic.

Seems there are some new keywords in this set too - hide and peril. Can't wait to find out more as the release gets closer.

## 28 [monkeyrama on May 15, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83870-black-rider/?do=findComment&comment=795658)

The boons and burdens seem to me to be a much neater, and more nuanced way of doing a campaign mode than the treasures. This looks to be really epic! Can't wait for it! And with the new easy mode, it will be possible to make it through at first with a slightly easier going game, then work up to take on the full power (which I think the Hobbit boxes would really benefit from). All too good!

## 29 [Glaurung on May 15, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83870-black-rider/?do=findComment&comment=795662)

FOUR Hobbit heroes? Hobbit trait support on nearly every card? In sphere threat reduction and card draw for hobbits?

I think my head is going to explode when I open the box the first time.

One thing I thought of today is if we are getting 4 hobbit heroes in black riders, one would think it makes sense to have 1 for each sphere…but what hobbit could possibly be tactics!!  Even leadership is a bit of a stretch but I suppose bilbo could fit that mold if they remade him. Still would be odd to see someone like pippin or merry as a tactics character (especially before their Gondor/Rohan affiliations) it would also be a shame tho if they leave out tactics from the box all together (none of the spoiled cards were tactics anyway). Will be interesting to see how they do that

## 36 [legolas18 on May 16, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83870-black-rider/?do=findComment&comment=795834)

That's true, tactics will be hard to fit in with the hobbits.  They might not have any of the hobbit heroes as tactics, but maybe give tactics a few extra player cards? And whoever said that Rosie might be a hero, I agree. It would be a bit hard, but none of the hobbits were real fighters anyway. I can see her being a low stat hero but having a really good ability.  (Well, now that I think about it, that's how most of the hobbits are…)  How do you think they'll make Sam? Any thoughts on what his stats/ability will be?

Completely random guess on Sam:

Sphere: Spirit

3 will power

1 atk/def

2 HP

logic:  Sam was nothing if not extremely loyal Frodo and their quest  to destroy the ring.  Even in the worst of cirucmstances he followed through with what needed done (even if he may have complained a bit a long the way) for this reason i'm giving him 3 will power and garbage for the rest of his stats

Ability: not even worth a specific guess because its not like id be correct, but thematically it would make sense if he did something to boost or even just assist other characters

I don't think there will be four hobbits. Gildor makes sense as the fourth hero, but then he doesn't fit into the tactics sphere either (but better than any hobbit does). Anayway, I love hobbits, but I hope that we get at least one non-hobbit hero in this expansion.

In addition to the new Frodo Baggins, The Black Riders delivers four other Hobbit heroes and thirty-three new player cards.

I agree. I think maybe along the lines of exhausting sam to ready frodo and the one ring or passing hobbit resources to frodo.

Great news, I think the thematics are well implemented into the mechanics, love it, well done by the designers.

Which 4 hobbits will there be? Sam, Mery, Pippen and??

Still would be odd to see someone like pippin or merry as a tactics character (especially before their Gondor/Rohan affiliations) it would also be a shame tho if they leave out tactics from the box all together (none of the spoiled cards were tactics anyway). Will be interesting to see how they do that



 

 

They could do Bandobras "Bullroarer" Took as a tactics hobbit…

 

But i see some difficulty on the tactics sphere for hobbits…

 

My guesses are (as sais earlier)

 

Merry, Sam, Fatty and Hamfast or Bandobras Took

haven't really seen anyone else asides from myself anticipate that Bilbo would be one of the hobbit heroes…

does no one else really think theres a chance we'll see him??  We havent had a true playable version of the most famous of hobbits since the first AP pack.  I know the over hill and under hill as well as on the doorstep were bilbo focused but i dont think that will matter much; besides by the time this comes out it will likely have been over a year since the first hobbit box came out.

Interesting point is that you do not lose the game when Frodo leaves play, but when the One RIng leaves play. Could some of the other hobbit heroes have the ring-bearer keyword?

## 46 [Gizlivadi on May 16, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83870-black-rider/?do=findComment&comment=796034)

I also find interesting the fact that The One Ring is an objective card but it does not have any encounter icon. I guess this could mean that the ring carries over to the other scenarios in the other saga packs?

Jeah!

Frodo and 4 hobbit heroes… Hmm… Sam, Pippin and Merry… Maybe Fatty Bolger as an fourth, But I likes the Rosy idea. "What! You think that you can go to see all those fancy town and dress shops out there and leave me to the Shire. Shame you Sam Gamwais! I will come too!" :-) She would have the spirit of adventurer, more than Fatty.

Allso Lobelia would have spirit of adventurer, but I expect to see her as an enemy ;-) so not likely candidate… But she would be a heck of fighter an her own. Smashing all those enemies with her deadle umbrella! She could scare faint hearted enemies with her pure staring!

It is pity if they don't include old forest and Barrow downs, but they are the easiest part to cut of… again… Later it is harder. I think that they will consentrate the journey of the ring, so no Rohan and very little Minas Tirith in this saga. This will be the journey of Frodo.

1.  WoTR saga: From Hobitton to the Bree, From Bree to the Weathertop, From Weathertop to the Rivendel

2. WoTR saga: From Rivendel to the Moria and Bridge!, From the outdoors of Moria to Lorien. From Lorien to the Falls of Raurors.

3. WoTR saga: From Rauros to Death marshes and to the Door, Ithilien; Minas Ithill and Ungoliath lair, Mordor; (rescue Frodo?, The way to the Mount Doom, Mount Doom and Gollums last effort?)

It is possible to have more, but these are likely and because the Frodo is the hero, the War in Rohan, Ents, Fangorn And Minash Tirith and Army of the Death are leaved to other expansions… Of couse it would nice to see what would have happened if Fellowship would have followed the hope of Boromir and try to go to Minash Tirith instead of Mordor, but it is very unlikely to happen…

 

Other speculations:

Tactic hobbit: First candidate: Merry… He killed the Witch King with Eovyn… Second candidate: Lobelia, no need to explain ;-)

Lore hobit: Sam: healing and fierce defending. Fatty Bolger,  don't know why…

Spirit hobbit: Pippin: Counter moves…

Leadership Hobbit: Rosa: Natural leader who gets other to do her fight. Lobelia: She has the will and means to make other to do her bidiings. Strong willed women indeed!

I would think this would be a safe assumption.  Not right away perhaps, but at some point in the Saga packs of the Ring Cycle, my guess is that we will see at least Sam and Bilbo as characters with a "ring bearer" trait.  Shoot, perhaps even a Smeagol/Gollum version?

The article states we'll be seeing the other adventures as well:

The Black Riders recreates a selection of dramatic event as told in the first half of J.R.R Tolkien's The Fellowship of the Ring. It is the first of a series of Saga expansions that eventually will allow players to replay Frodo's epic journey from the Shire to Mount Doom, as well the dramatic events experienced by other members of the Fellowship.

So we may well get some Entish action, Rohan, and Minas Tirith :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Spirit hobbit: Pippin: Counter moves…



 

A Spirit Pippin is already coming. They have never made a duplicate Hero in the same sphere so I don't know if they would start now. Pippin doesn't really fit in any other sphere though. And as said before none of the Hobbits in Fellowship fit in Tactics. Though these are likely the only hobbit heroes we will see in the entire saga expansions, with the exception of Frodo (too many other cool characters to do them over again) so we may be getting a Merry/Pippin from after their adventures.

Its surprising they will make a tactics hobbit considering how difficult it was for FFG to make a tactics dwarf period. Only one of the 13. Still a low threat, high questing hero with a good support ability is something tactics is missing.

they'll probably just include them as a location card or two. the box is supposed to cover the journey from hobbiton to rivendell, so they must get included somewhere.

i suppose it would have been quite hard to make a whole quest out of the old forest because what is the story? they could fight a few trees and wolves, and bats i suppose, and the conclusion would be them safely reaching tom bombadil's house. but what else can they do with it… not much.

the barrowdowns would have been a bit easier, and they could have included some new treasure cards as well, because isn't that where they find their weapons? (im a bit rusty on the plot of the book!)

well yes, i hope they do. i could probably think of some quest ideas, but it would mean that they would almost take up another saga pack themselves.

in fact i think that ffg have made less exciting areas of tolkien's work into quests - i think the old forest and barrows would translate rather nicely.

i mean who wouldnt want to face old man willow? it could be a great quest, with a wait for bombadil to come to the rescue. and yes the downs would make nice areas for the swords.

thats why im pretty dissapointed

I don't see why they can't include the barrow wights and the old forest either at the end of the first quest or beginning of the second… The first hobbit box did a nice job of combining separate parts of the adventures.  The stone giants/goblin king…riddles in the dark/escape from goblin town/ escape via eagles. Hopefully they're just as creative with this expansion

I agree completely. Personally I'm sick of FFG making these "recreation" quests where they take an adventure the Fellowship went on and copy it directly into one AP, especially when you can't actually play that quest with Frodo as the ring-bearer. It just takes all uniqueness of that adventure away for me. But who knows, maybe they'll do some sort of pack with the Barrow Downs or the Old Forest compatible as well with the One Ring card and Frodo. One can only hope…

i've just realised that they've dumped the baggins sphere. i was hoping we might be able to reuse all the baggins cards we got in the hobbit box in these ones (even though there were only a couple). they could have put the new frodo hero in the baggins sphere as well, and built it up as a proper sphere with lots of cards.

although i suppose frodo isn't really a burglar. but it would have been cool if we could have got some more use out of the hobbit box cards. they are kind of like dead cards now.

 

this is a long time in the future… but im guessing that secrecy will make a big comeback at some stage in these sagas. because lots of people are going to want to play with just 2 heroes -- frodo and sam -- as they trudge their way to mordor. (unless they make gollum into a hero too -- why not? they could fiddle with it a bit so he could still fight and quest, but have some bad side to him too).  the last quest is just calling out for frodo and sam hiding and keeping secret as they climb mount doom, dodging all the enemies. it is perfect for secrecy. it wouldnt seem right taking anyone else along with us.

In prevoius Lotr card game from Decher Gollum was a shadow card and Smeagol was a free people card. So he can even fight with him self it was quite theamatic.

Here we can have some kind of flaws which i happen in the begin of the quest by random effect……..so ith can be quite funny.

I'm calling it right now: the Hobbit/Pipe deck will be the next big thing.



 

      So, I just thought I would say to the Forum that I am EXTREEMLY happy with the direction this game appears to be taking…particularly regarding the new hiding mechanic showcased on some of the spoiled cards. It appears that I will be able to enjoy one of the experiences dear to my heart. I just love sneaking.

       I was a Lord of the Rings fan before I knew how to tie my shoes. I love, love, LOVE this game. One thing that I found myself wishing I could experience was a sensation I had when reading the books of “narrowly” escaping detection. I wanted this so badly that, when I collected the Decipher CCG I tried in vain to build a sneaky hobbit deck from day one. This was unfortunate, as the hobbit race (each faction was its own little sphere, usually divided by race, but sometimes subdivided by country) was neglected time and again until the very end of the game. By then, however, all the other races were so powerful, only blind stupid incompetency in my opponents would allow my Sam, Bilbo, Frodo, Pip & M “Sting” deck win. I don’t learn very well, because as soon as I discovered that there was a secrecy mechanic coming out, I started organizing my game to accommodate the new cards. It goes without saying that my decks really stank. The Secrecy mechanic was (I assume) abandoned as cumbersome & my dream of sneaking slowly faded. Many times have I, when espying the tantalizing spoiler for an upcoming release, chatted my LoTR Captains Facebook page about how this time there is a chance for secrecy! This time, with the Twins! This time Elrond! This time the mother…er…Father of all Secrecy Hero’s, Glorfindel, will see it done! (Benhanses can attest)

Smeagol… Yeash of cource my presioushh… He can even be the fourth hobbit as Smeagol is/was a hobbit in the beginning before the power of the ring corrupted it to that bizarre grazy character he ended to become… This is not likely thing to happen, but a Smeagol as an hero is allmost likely. But most propably he will be an object card like Arven was in Mirkwood cycle.

But definitely we will see Smeagol in one form or another: Ally, Objective - Ally, hero etc…

Ehhh no. Sorry, I don't think so, and here's why.

I've seen Rosie Cotton & Bilbo Baggins & Bullroarer Took mentioned in ths thread, but Bullroarer to my knowlegde is dead by this time. (so NO way he'll show up. Bilbo is already in rivendell as he left when he gave the ring to frodo; and these saga expensions really follow the books so Bilbo, I think is out. Then there's Rosie…nice idea..but I don't see her popping up as a hero until the scouring of the shire chapter, when she starts playing a role really.

here's my thoughts of the 4 hobbit heroes: (following saga i.e. the book)

1. Tactics: farmer maggot -> he stood firm (with 3 of his hounds) against a black rider. no other hobbit in this part of the book seems to fit taictics any better than maggot's deeds helping the hobbit's escape detection. And if they don't implant him here in the saga, where then?

2. Lore: samwise -> he loves elvish lore and in this part of the book he goes on about them. I believe later on in the saga we will see a spirit and tactics sam with high willpower in the mordor stage against shelob & on mount doom. (along with a gollum hero mind you)

3. Spirit: fatty bolger -> the only reason I add him here is of the simple fact that he won't be able to show up anywhere else in the saga. I know, he left early because of fear, which gives him low willpower, but not all spirit heroes need high willpower; maybe fatty will get a good abiltiy? Just a hunch…

4. Leadership : -> dead hard to determine. FFG said 4 HOBBIT heroes. none seem to fit but frodo; and he's taken. My best bet is Merry actually.

 

 

Just my reasoning.

## 70 [scwont on May 19, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83870-black-rider/?do=findComment&comment=796782)

I'm far from an expert on the story, but from a quick bit of research on the plot and characters my guesses are:

Sam (Spirit)

Merry (Tactics)

Farmer Maggot (Lore)

Bilbo (Leadership)

Fatty seems to be the other likely candidate. I'm assuming we won't get a second Pippin so soon after the first (I suspect we'll see him again later in the saga).  I would've picked Gildor as a shoe-in if they hadn't announced 4 hobbits.

SiCK_Boy said:

No, only that we will see Frodo and 4 hobbits. So it is likely that we allso see other heroes in here. Early story heroes include Aragorn definitely.

After we get to the Rivendel, we will get Legolas, Gimli and Boromir again… Hard to say if we see others… It is possible though, but I would not bet on them… Gandalf would be one, but he seems somewhat hard to balance hero, unles his treath cost is something like 30-40… or his abilities has to be really weak, So Gandalf Ally is more likely, but it is not impossible to see Gandalf as an hero. Maybe we can run solo Frodo + Gandalf decks :-)

Glorfinder is possible, because he appears in the Road and saves the day in Bruinen (instead or Arven that was put in his shoes in the movies). Barliman is another, but same problem as with Fatty… not very active in books. Maybe as an lore character? Hmmm… Not so many characters in the beginning of the book. Tom and Coldberry, but better as an objectives or in event cards… And most propably we skip them again… It would be really nice to see some seriously sexy Goldberry as an card, but not likely to happen… Farmer Maggot was mentioned and he is a good candidate to an hobbit, maybe even better than Fatty. Maybe some unnamed ranger as an adjuntant to Aragorn. Later there are good candidates more. Like a hero version of Faramir in the Ithilien part and so on…

Because this expansion is a stand alone with core (Like Hobbit expansions vere), we will definitely see new Pippin, even one version is coming out in other expansion. Core set offers Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas (+ Gandalf) so what we most propably get are Pippin, Merry, Sam and Boromir, so that we will have the full Fellowship. The next best bet is a hero Version of Gandalf to this group… just interesting to see if he is a worth of putting in the deck as an hero… The ally version is so good!

Gandalf - a friend of Shire folk
threat cost 25
Willpower 4
Attack strengh 4
Defence Strength 4
Hit points 4
Istari
Gains one multisphere resource token in the beginning of each round. Can not gain resource tokens in any other way.

Gandalf - a grey emissary
threat cost 25
Willpower 4
Attack strengh 4
Defence Strength 4
Hit points 4
Istari
Does not belong to any sphere. Can use his resource tokens to play any event cards recardless of its sphere.

Gandalf - member of Gray counsil
threat cost 12
Willpower 4
Attack strengh 4
Defence Strength 4
Hit points 4
Istari
Does not belong to any sphere. Can use his resource tokens to play any ally cards recardless of its sphere. Increase your threat by 2 at the end of the round.

Hard character to balance… so maybe we don't get him anyway….

im guessing that this first box wont include people like boromir because it only covers the journey up to rivendell. the second box will be where the fellowship actually joins together and sets off, so we will probably get a few new fellowship heroes there (hopefully).

we've already got a strider version of aragorn and 2 boromirs, so i reckon it will be gimli and legolas and maybe a hero gandalf. maybe we'll get a new version of elrond too, because that will be his main scene in the story. i dont think he gets a bigger scene in any of the other books.

I hope they release at GENCON…a mad rush to the FFG booth again Thursday morning!

That's true, tactics will be hard to fit in with the hobbits.  They might not have any of the hobbit heroes as tactics, but maybe give tactics a few extra player cards? And whoever said that Rosie might be a hero, I agree. It would be a bit hard, but none of the hobbits were real fighters anyway. I can see her being a low stat hero but having a really good ability.  (Well, now that I think about it, that's how most of the hobbits are…)  How do you think they'll make Sam? Any thoughts on what his stats/ability will be?

 

 

Completely random guess on Sam:

Sphere: Spirit

3 will power

1 atk/def

2 HP

logic:  Sam was nothing if not extremely loyal Frodo and their quest  to destroy the ring.  Even in the worst of cirucmstances he followed through with what needed done (even if he may have complained a bit a long the way) for this reason i'm giving him 3 will power and garbage for the rest of his stats

Ability: not even worth a specific guess because its not like id be correct, but thematically it would make sense if he did something to boost or even just assist other characters



I think your stats look about right and I would suggest his ability be: “Choose and ready one character per round.”

maybe sam could take on any wounds that were meant for frodo, so he would be like a shield for him.

seeing as you lose the game when you lose the ring-bearer, that might be a handy skill to have.

but he wouldnt be much use for any quests outside of the saga expansion, though

No, he would if you paired him up with Spirit Frodo Baggins.

I think that would be a shame because then Sam’s utility in the game would be based on the presence of Frodo. That would be lame, but still a possibility. I believe Pippin’s ability is only good in an all-Hobbit deck, so Sam and the other hobbits might be similar. However, I like it better when the Hobbits have abilities that are more general such as with Frodo and Bilbo, as they allow you to be more flexible in deck building.

I think Sam should have an ability that works with Frodo. I don't really think Sam is a functional character alone (he exists at his best, in support of Frodo,and all that is good about his character comes out of that service).

For the purposes of a pure lore approach, that would perhaps be nice.  For the broader purposes of a game platform?  I think we are still too early in the life-cycle of this game to dedicate a hero (who has had no other version in the game) to such a "can only use this way" purpose…

 

I woul dlove to see that Sam has a dedicated "bonus" for being paired with Frodo (or perhaps even other Hobbits), but should also be able to function away from him with other heroes.  Perhaps something related to his curiosity with the elves as well?

sam showed initiative and courage when alone after the encounter with shelob so i do not think he should have a frodo only use (though an ability that targets frodo would be great)

he was also a ringbearer remember - so that puts him in a rather exclusive position for some decent stats….certainly willpower

Great points.  Equally as impressive, was his one-man assualt on the Cirith Ungol fortress to reclaim Frodo.  Can you imagine navigating your way through Minus Morgal and then Cirith Ungol on the footstep of Mordor?  Unbelievable act of courage.

And to further that point, it also puts him in the obvious position of bearing the ring on this game!

Do I hear suggestions and implications of a one-man Secrecy deck?!?!  burla [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_scripts/ckeditor/plugins/smiley/images/burlon.gif]

That would be awesome!

maybe they could do an amusing one like searching your deck for cram and adding it to your hand, or returning it to your hand from the discard pile… he always seemed to be in charge of the food in the movies

## 89 [legolas18 on May 23, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83870-black-rider/?do=findComment&comment=798097)

Haha! I like that idea. "Exhaust Sam to search for one food card in your deck or discard pile. Add that card to your hand."

I would use his ability all the time. sonreir [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_scripts/ckeditor/plugins/smiley/images/sonreir.gif]

i want to see a card like 'bolger's cloak' which allows a character to place damage that would go on them onto any other character and then discard the cloak (the crickhollow scene is perhaps my favourite of all the scenes from the books)

## 91 [Rapier1 on May 24, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83870-black-rider/?do=findComment&comment=798696)

I didn't specify that the ability had to work with only Frodo.

For example if Sam had;

Reduce your threat by one whenever another hero is the target of an attack - that would be a useful ability to have in any game, however it would be even better with Frodo (who turns attacks which deal damage into threat).

Thematically it would reprsent Sam keeping everyone's spirits up when the going is getting to it's toughest.

 

However I personally think that this game is already putting in heroes that are heaviliy dependant on only other cards, and that a stronger (frodo only) ability wouldn't be out of place either. Pippin for example, more or less relies on only taking him with Hobbits.

The new outlands hero likewise, only works at all in an outlands deck (which is also so amazing that if you ever include him, you're essentially commiitting to "the" outlands strategy).

 

Although I don't like the forced outlands theme (because it's too strong, and too inflexibile) I am looking forward to the hobbit theme - and honestly I don't think Sam having to be taken with Frodo is appreciabily more restrictive than say, Dain forcing you into the dwarf theme. Especially if Sam is designed to work withthe Frodo that we get in the Black Riders (Since he comes from that set).

If you prefer however, Sam could have a similar ability to Pippin - one that works when you only control Hobbit heroes (Which is still themetically accurate, at all stages of the story, since the hobbits always stuck together when they could and drew strength from their kinship). This wouldn't be any different from a dwarf theme, and in fact would be pretty similar to how the dwarfs were done (With some working outside the theme, the way Frodo and Bilbo do, and some working only in the theme, such as Dain or any dwarf hero with a rule about controlling 5 dwarfs).

 

This game really needs to focus on other themes (Besides dwarf) to help control deck building and allow continued card development - "Hobbit" is clearly the next big one (getting some love in the gondor cycle in the form of pippin, as well as being the obvious focus for the start of the next saga expansions). Hobbit will probably outstrip Gondor by the time Black Riders is out. We already know (based on spoiled cards and pack one) that while the current cycle is set in Gondor, it doesn't exclusively support that theme. (for example we have a hobbit, an outlands and a rohan hero spoiled… to go with two gondor heros from the deluex expansion).

I think that the hobbit theme will expand rapidly and will require some of the heroes in black rider to be hobbit theme focused. (I'm expecting a second version of Pippin in the box, maybe he won't be hobbit only, if that is the only Sam hero we get, he definitely should be hobbit rather than generic focused).

Although a generic Sam that can search for food items is a great idea (it requires a lot more "food" in the game).

Heroes released during the cycle mean nothing. Do you remember the Dwarrowdelf heroes? Elladan, Elrohir, Aragorn, Háma, Glorfindel, Elrond - no dwarf at all. However I agree that this cycle didn't support Gondor much so far. When counting that one of the upcoming APs will enhance Outlands even more as has been stated in the preview, all I can say about this cycle is meh.

100% agree. Only deluxe or Saga expansion have fit heroes to scenarios.

## 94 [Rapier1 on May 25, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83870-black-rider/?do=findComment&comment=798915)

Well, the cards released so far also have a split across what they support.

Also I wouldn't have said Dwarrowelf was a dwarf expansion cycle particularly - the dwarfs got good cards for sure, but so did other teams. Dwarfs really got their love in the hobbit saga expansions though (hence they now have a massive % of the card pool).
