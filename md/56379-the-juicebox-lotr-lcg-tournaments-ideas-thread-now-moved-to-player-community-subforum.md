On February 20th, 2012, FFG instigated subforums for our LOTR LCG community. At that time I began a new thread in the Player Community subforum for juicebox Tournament activity: The juicebox LOTR LCG Tournaments ~ Top Ten Hall of Fame & Ideas Thread [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=286&efcid=4&efidt=619212].

Original Post:

I’m considering starting a series of week long tournaments highlighting a specific quest with specific deck building requirements. In the next post, I’ll provide a sample of what I’m planning to launch first. Between now and then, I would welcome thoughtful input around how I am setting this up. Also feel free to use this thread to make suggestions for future Tournament of the Week ideas (quests and deck building parameters).

I’m looking forward to hearing your thoughts, and if you could keep them focused to this particular topic here that would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks all!

The juicebox LOTR LCG Tournament of the Week (#1)

[sAMPLE POST - NOT FOR OFFICIAL USE]

Welcome to my first (of what could become a regular thing) LOTR LCG Tournament of the Week. The idea behind this is that for one week (Sunday – Saturday), everyone is invited to participate in playing a particular quest with particular deck building requirements as outlined in this first post. You are then invited to record and post your final score, the heroes you used, and any narrative you’d like to add.

Note: this is not a place to post results from the past. The tournament has a one-week lifespan, and only games played and recorded throughout this week are valid. Throughout the week, I will keep this first post updated with the Top Ten results.

Will you place in the Top Ten for the week? I hope you’ll participate and find out.

After the end of this week’s tournament, you are welcome to continue to post results to this thread if you continue to play this particular quest under these particular parameters. However, the Top Ten on this first post will not continue to be updated after the week is over, thus preserving (like a time capsule) the results from this week’s tournament. Further, and in general, please refrain from using this thread for extensive theorizing and/or conversation that is not directly related to this particular tournament. Nothing against other conversations – it’s just, that’s what other threads are for. And now… on to this week’s Tournament of the Week!

Tournament #1: Journey Down the Anduin [1 Core Set Only] [solo Play]

This week’s tournament is inspired by Marlow’s recent desire [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=577637&efpag=0] to absolutely conquer the Anduin. While playing Solo, using only one deck made from one core set may not be everyone’s cup of tea, defined parameters are what will make each Tournament of the Week a unique and specific challenge. I hope you enjoy it, and Quest Well!!

Does the requirement "one core set only" absolute, i.e. no cards from adventure packs?

Good question. That was my intention. That way, for future tournaments, the same quest could be run again with different deck building parameters, like [One Core Set + all Shadows of Mirkwood adventure packs] for example or [1-3 Core Sets only] or [Open Build - i.e. use any cards you like according to standard deck building rules].

That said, it sounds like I'll need to word that piece with more clarity.  Would [One Core Set Only - no adventure packs] suffice?

Thanks!

Sounds Well formularen to me :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] but of it's one core set only with no AP then you only have 4 quests to go at ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

I'm not sure I understand. The particular quest for this week's tournament would be Journey Down the Anduine (just the one quest), and the deck building restriction would be that you'd be limited to tackling that quest using a deck with cards built just from one core set. What do you mean by "only have 4 quests to go at?"

Every time there is a different weekly tournament, there would be a specific quest chosen for the tournament - just one (unless for that week the tournament happened to be a "nightmare" variant or some such). Can you let me know if I need to make a certain part of the instructions more clear? I will make a couple small fixes to the sample posted above, and hopefully that will help (Specifically, I will strike "as outlined in this first post." from the second sentence.)

Thanks for the feedback. My hope is to have the instructions for participating as clearly laid out as possible before launching the first one. So, all questions are helpful. Sharing your understanding of how this would work based on what I've written would be helpful too. Again, thanks!

Good idea! And what about 2,3,4-players games? I don't play solo. Only 2 players games with my wife.

Good question. I've been toying around with a few options...

1) Different weekly tournament formats could specifically be for either solo, 2, 3, or 4 player games. By making each tournament very specific it would either give people a natural out from participating that week (i.e. "well, I don't play solo, so I'm out") or it could encourage people to try something new (i.e. "okay, I'll give this solo thing a go" or "I'm gonna need to find a buddy to play with this week if I want in on this weeks tournament").

2) I could make a separate Top Ten list for each Solo, 2 player, 3 player, and 4 player each week. (That has me spinning a bit just thinking about it though.)

3) Each week could offer Top Tens for both Solo and 2 player formats (maybe the most popular formats at this point?) (also, maybe a little more manageable for me).

4) Some other possibility I'm not thinking of...

Honestly, I'm leaning toward option one at this point, making each tournament very specific around 3 main variables:

1) The Quest for that Week

2) The Deck Building Parameters

3) The Number of Players

BUT, I'm really open to feedback about all of this. What do you think about these options? My desire is to brainstorm, problem-solve on the front end, launch the first tournament this Sunday, see out that goes, evaluate, and continue from there based on how things go.

 

[Also, Kiwina - I saw your post too... glad you're game!]

I decided to give this a go tonight. I threw together a Spirit/Leadership deck with Eowyn, Dunhere and Theodred as the heroes. The first game had Unexpected Courage, Sneak Attack and Gandalf in the opening hand - how can it get any better? However, due to Necromancer's Reach, Eowyn eventually bit the dust in the second phase, and I couldn't muster enough quest power after that. I conceded the game shortly after.
So, on to a second game. I had Gandalf in my opening hand, but no Sneak Attack this time. I eventually drew it and decided to use it on Faramir so I didn't lose the quest somewhere in phase 2. The next draw, of course, was Gandalf... In phase 2, I revealed a lot of locations and eventually had to return Northern Tracker tue to a Shadow card as it was my only exhausted ally. I couldn't replay it, had 3 locations in the staging area, was at 45 threat and facing the Marsh Adder. I conceded.
So, I was off to the third game. Weirdly, everything went super-smooth in spite of me not drawing Gandalf, Northern Tracker, Sneak Attack or Unexpected Courage. However, I got two quick Guide to Loriens and an early Banks of Anduin. I managed to "recycle" the Banks 3 times, staying clear of any more dangerous cards. I dealt with the Troll by chumping with a Snowbourne Scout and using For Gondor! for enough damage. When I finished phase 2 in turn 8, I didn't reveal any more enemies and only had to deal with a Dol Guldur Beastmaster which I could exactly kill. I still had the opportunity to recycle a Greeting of the Galadhrim with my Dwarven Tomb to lower my threat again.
Final score: 103 - 8 turns, 25 threat, 1 damage on Eowyn and Theodred each (Necromancer's Reach), 4 victory points from the initial Hill Troll.
I was pretty lucky as I didn't draw anything really dangerous - no second Troll, no Marsh Adder, no Gladden Fields, no Ufthak. So, I'm not really sure I can do better, at least not without an insane amount of luck.

I really like this idea.  Could do all sorts of fun concepts.  Three heroes of different spheres for instance.  s  I think you can do solo weeks and non solo weeks.  Two player isn't that hard to play solo if you wanted to.  aAfter that though you need another person or two.

Trantor and wraith428... THANKS for the great feedback!

Trantor - WOW! I'll be amazed if someone can top that third game experience of yours next week when this goes live. Can't wait to see if it's possible. gran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif]

And wraith428 - That's a great idea about adding hero parameters to some of the tournaments. I hadn't considered that. I like it.

Also, i appreciate your thoughts about specifying number of players per tournament. The more I think about it, the more I like the idea of setting up each tournament to be very particular. There's so much exciting about this game (especially with the new expansion coming out soon and a new series of adventure packs to look forward to). I think these tournaments can be a way to keep some of the "old stuff" fresh and worth revisiting in a fun, challenging, and focused way.

Looking forward to Sunday...

Another idea for the future pile… Journey Down the Anduin w/ a starting party of heroes who’s base threat is 30+ (i.e. have to deal with the Troll on turn 1.) Not sure it’s even possible.

Wraith428

P.S. - Really like the Tournament of the Week idea.

Thanks Wraith428! That could be a fun idea to try for 2 player games. I imagine solo play starting with 30+ threat would result in an mulligan epidemic of outrageous proportion.

Also, I'm foreseeing a potential problem with my idea...

Up until tonight I've been able to go back and Edit the orriginal post for this thread. Now, tonight, that feature is gone! Does that ability lock after 24 hours or something? That could put a serious damper on my plans to keep the Top Ten updated throughout the week.

Does anyone have experience with this kind of thing on FFG Forums? Suggestions?

I also had a good deal of fun with the Anduin-challenge and I fully support the idea.

I have a suggestion though that may be an major deviation from your plan but could greatly improve everyones exprience.

I really think you should hook up the guys from www.cardboardoftherings.com on this one. In case you don't allready know them, they produce a really great bi-weekly podcast (dont worry, you can download mps straight from their blog) on the game. If you dont know them yet and care enough about the game to read and post about in the forum, you absolutely HAVE to check them out. They got a good understanding of the game and they are very talented casters. Seriously, I listen to esport commentary (mostly SC2) basically whenever I can and these guys really hold up to the professional ones.
The production is great, the content is interesting and useful and sure as hell theyre entertaining, if not to say funny. I know this is a shameless shoutout, but do not worry. I dont know them personally, I never talked to them, Im not one of them on a fake account. Im just convinced that they could greatly improve the concept of a "themed tournament week".

So how could this work? Basically youd have to figure out the theme and hand it to them (Im sure they are more than willing to provide feedback). In addition to posting it on the forum, they could announce the tournamet style on their podcast, which would make it a 2 week format, which Im absolutely fine with. For me as an almost 30-employed-kindof-guy, a 1 week format would leave me with maybe 1 or 2 evenings of play, which isnt quite so much. During the following podcast they could then proceed to report results from the previous segment, discuss it and call out the next format.

Youd basically reach a much larger audience and could enrichen the whole experience by additional coverage.

Sure, its more work for everyone involved. Do they want to do it? Do you like the idea? Absolutely in the dark here. I just really like the sound of it and Im pretty certain that it could be greatly successfull.

Also, dont forget to report your game results with the help of this http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=579185 [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=579185] thread. Thanks!

UnthoughtKnown, thanks for the idea! I'm actually a huge fan of Cardboard of the Rings. I've listened to all of their episodes, and they were quite influential in my decision to take the plunge, make the investment, and start playing this beautiful game. Yeah, they're great... so, shamelessly plug away!

At face value, I'd be more than happy to collaborate with them - or at least have a conversation about the idea. I'm pretty sure LightDarker and some of the other guys are fairly active on these forums (so if you're seeing this CBOTR, feel free to weigh in). But first, I'd like to kind of give this a try on a "smaller" scale and test out a tournament or two on the forums to see how they go, gain feedback, consider how the general idea and format may need to be refined, and make sure I can be a good host in all of this. If I'm having fun with it, and if there's a good response, I'm sure I'll learn a lot from the first few tournaments about how to make the process even better. Then, maybe, it may just be time to check in with the big boys over in Toronto at CBOTR Headquarters. gran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif]

Love the idea of a tournament!

How seriously do we take this btw? If we want to make this a contest, the players probably shouldn't post their results in this thread to prevent copying their decks and moves, but send a PM to juicebox who could then update the Top 10 and, after the torunament is over, post the summary of the best scores.

Btw, I got a 101. So close! So close...


And what's up with the frickin text editor? Pursued by shadow?

Hi leptokurt! First of all, congrats on the 101. I just read your round by round account on Marlow's thread [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=577637], and all I have to say is... that's awesome. Well, that's awesome and I'm jealous, but mostly just that's awesome. Now, can you get a repeat performance next week? gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]

As for posting results in the tournaments, I'm envisioning people post at least their Final Score and their Starting Heroes. Whatever someone wants to post beyond that (extra narrative, descriptions of rounds, cards used in their deck, etc...) would be totally up to them. Do you think revealing the Starting Heroes would be too big of a tell? I'm imagining not, but I'm curious what others think...

Others?

Thoughts about the Top Ten...

I've been thinking. This is a living card game, right? So, why not make a living Top Ten Hall of Fame list for those who participate in multiple The juicebox LoTR LCG Tourmament of the Week tournaments?

Here's how it would work:

Hall of Fame placements would be scored as follows: in each weekly tournament, a #1 ranked placement earns the participant 10 points, a #2 ranked placement earns the participant 9 points, a #3 ranked placement earns the participant 8 points, and so on all the way down to a #10 ranked placement earning the participant 1 solitary point. After the completion of this first weekly tournament, I will start a separate thread that will house the Top Ten Hall of Fame.

So, feel free to post multiple successes in each weekly tournament. Theoretically, someone could score as many as 55 points (occupying all ten spots of a weekly Top Ten final result) in one week toward their Top Ten Hall of Fame ranking. gran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif]

 Gotta say, I don't think allowing multiple placements of the same person in one tournament is a good idea. This would just favor people with more time and willing to do tedious things. I'd say if I get a better score than my 109, than scratch the first score and use the new one. And I think it might frustrate people, too. Just assume, that I can duplicate some scores around 109, people with a score of 130 or 120 might get annoyed.

 

I hope this doesn't come off as negative though as I really like your tournament idea!

plueschi, I welcome all thoughtful feedback. So, thank you.

At this point, I've been kind of imagining the Top Ten as functioning like the Top Ten lists you might find on an arcade game or on a pinball machine. If you play multiple times and can land repeat strong performances, good for you. However, I think what you are suggesting also has merit. I'd be curious to have other players weigh in on this piece, as I'm not fixated on either of these options. For now, I'll likely try out my initial idea and see how that goes, but all the data will be there (when people post successful questing experiences) to go back and rework the Top Ten if it proves out that your hunch is more accurate.

That said, do others have strong thoughts on this? I'd especially appreciate your input if you have experience running tournaments for various games. What I'm after is creating a specific option for an additional satisfying game play experience, beyond how satisfying this game may already be to play in all its various formats outside of this particular tournament structure.

I think I like the original plan better 1 person 1 entry but maybe that's biased as a result of never getting into the top 10 on any arcade game because of the one guy who plays all the time and owns all 10 spots.  I'd still give it a shot either way, but I usually only get around playing 1-3 quests a week so  I wouldn't have much of a chance in getting to the "All time top 10" I believe you called it which I probably wouldn't anyway but it comes down to the same theory as the 1 guy at the arcade who owns all 10 spots makes it not as fun for everyone else.  Just my opinion.

 Adding on to what I just said I do think that being able to try the quest again and change your score is a good idea, just everyone gets one entry that can be changed if you do better the next time.

plueschi - I've been thinking more about your feedback, and Avalanche, I appreciate your thoughts as well. I gotta say, even without anyone else weighing in, I think you two have swayed me. Your idea would help to "spread out the glory," while also allowing for the dynamic of competing with both self and others.

I'm for it. So, here's how I'm thinking about revising that piece:

As the week unfolds, I will keep this first post updated with the Top Ten results. (Each participant can occupy a maximum of one Top Ten spot at a time, so you’re welcome to try and best your own result throughout the week).

Does that seem clear? My aim with the introduction is to boil it down to be concise, engaging, and clear.

As always, thoughtful feedback is always welcome. I've really appreciated it so far, and I think your suggestions will help make this a more enjoyable experience. So, thanks!

I know the change has already been made, but I figured I'd add my vote to 1 entry per player.  I'd rather see 10 different names in the top 10 than several repeats of the same player.

 Hey buddy,

 

I think I will skip this one and hop onto the next challenge. I think the deck changes I have to make are a little to steep. See, my decks are sleeved. In different colours. Unsleeving them, putting a new deck together and re-building my old decks afterwards would take me like 1 1/2 hours at least. Also I kinda forgot which cards came with the core set. I'd have to look up lots of cards online to confirm that they match the limitation. In short: Its a hell of a lot work to participate :S

Well folks,

We're 55.5% of the way through the week for the very first The juicebox LOTR LCG Tournament of the Week!

I'd like to thank everyone who has participated so far, and I'm sure excited to see how the second half of the week plays out.

Plans for the future are in the works - both for the immediate future (The juicebox LOTR LCG Tournament of the Week #2 - which will launch this Sunday) and for the longer term. Likely, just to give you an idea of where things are headed, these first few weeks will focus on revisiting quests from the original Core Set, and then a series of tournaments will be hosted focusing on the quests from the various Mirkwood Adventure Packs. Of course, all this will be unfolding as many of us begin our delight in exploring the deep and the dark of Khazad Dûm. Geez, the future holds so many possibilities! As more tournaments are played, the Top Ten Hall of Fame (yet to be established) will become of greater and greater interest. So, stay tuned! There is much to look forward to in the weeks and months to come.

As always, if any of you have ideas for future tournaments (particular quests, deck building parameters, etc...) or for tournament logistics in general please feel free to post them here in this thread. You're welcome to PM me as well.

Journey Well.

 One major thing I think you should do, i try to avoid things being too up-to-date.

I'll expand on that, as it currently makes no sense.

I'm in the UK, we normally get the expansions with the new quests anywhere from 1-4 weeks after the release is announced on the Web. My FLGS is in the process of going bust, so I only got the Dead Marshes Yesterday.

Compared with the US, it sucks. Compared with much of Europe, it's great. From what I've read on here, some countries are still waiting on Emyn Muil (not sure if there's anywhere that doesn't have Rhosgobel)

so, in order to keep it fair, I think that rather than ever having "completely open build" it should be more along the lines of "Core and any expansions up to X" where X is an expansion that was released (according to this site) a couple of months ago.

Obviously, it's great to put the new cards in, and some of them are very cool, but it seems unfair to disadvantage people by where they live.

 

Please don't take any of that as a criticism - I think the whole thing is a great idea, just my input tot ry and keep things balanced.

(BTW +1 for 1 player, 1 score per week)

Agree. I'm for Ukraine and I have only Rhosgobel. LGS promised to get all Mirkwood APs (except Hunt for Gollum) this year. Hunt and Osgiliath we'll have only next year.

Thanks Mighty Jim and LEGA. Your thoughts are important to me, as I do hope to craft the tournaments to be as inclusive as possible while also striving to focus on the natural diversity that is built in to the game - there's just so many different ways to enjoy it! While I may not hit the nail on the head every time, especially given the lack of certain cards in certain markets, rest assured that my plan at this point really is to start oldest to newest (and Mighty Jim, your scaling idea for the Mirkwood cycle is almost exactly along the lines of what I've been imagining for this first run through). Also, I had imagined hosting a Massing at Osgiliath tournament sooner than later, but LEGA, to at least help with some of the market delay issues (again, I probably won't be on a satisfactory pace for everyone with all of them), I'm now considering at least delaying that one for a while.

Also, since there are currently 10 quests released (US side of the pond) and the flow of new quests being added to our pool from FFG will be monthly, a weekly tournament will mean getting to revisit quests (with different parameters each time) often (especially here in the early days). So, if someone misses playing a certain quest the first time it appears as a focus for a weekly tournament (either because you are playing the game already but don't have the cards yet or because someone has yet to join the game until next week/month/year), rest assured - that quest will eventually be back. Now, while this won't necessarily help create even parity for the ongoing/living nature of the All Time Top Ten, it will at least (hopefully) allow all players to take a crack at a given quest for a weekly tournament at some point along the way.

Hope this helps... LOVE the international bunch we are, enjoying this game.  (Would make Tolkien quite happy, I think.)  happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]

As Mighty Jim stated we live in Different countries I want to add something else at this point. As these tournements last one week you should fix a concrete time though we all live in different time zones. While in the US it may be sunday, in Germany we still have saturday or vice versa, honestly I'm not quite sure about it. But the point is. While I write this post it is very late at night where I live while it is afternoon elsewhere.

No critics just a point to keep in mind. Stick to your great work!

Some ideas for future games:

 

- players have to play with a given hero combo / a given deck

- players have to start with a given encounter card (instead of drawing randomly)

- players may only use 2 copies of each card

- players may not use Éowyn lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif]

- players may not use neutral cards

Good question OnkelZorni.

Since I live in Seattle, Washington in the United States, the weekly tournament will end at midnight on Saturday night in the Pacific Time Zone. I realize that I'm being egocentric in that sense. I thought about organizing it around the time zone for FFG's headquarters in Minnesota, but I think I'll have more success with being consistent if I stick to my time zone and ask others to accommodate.

I believe Germany is 9 hours ahead (during this time of year - we are on a daylight savings time adjustment), so the end of the week's tournament will be 9am (Sunday morning) your time.

As an aside, every time I update the Top Ten listing I have been posting the time of the update.

Hope that helps.

Hmmmmm... I find myself thinking some more about the issue of timing. OnkelZorni, your last aside highlights something that might be very useful for us all - the forums ARE set to FFG Headquarters time. Very interesting. Very interesting, indeed. This has me rethinking my statement above about basing these tournaments around Seattle time. IF we all base it around the FFG Headquarters time, we can all see the date and time of our posts right there in the forum threads. (And whose to say I'll always be in Seattle when it's time for the week to turn over anyway?) So, after all, I think it would be simpler for me, and I think it would be simpler for everyone to make the cutoff time each week at midnight FFG time, as marked by the forums themselves.

Since I did not specify this for the first week's tournament, I may have to offer a little wiggle room if any last minute (Seattle time) posts come in for this first week. BUT, from this week on, we can use FFG time, and I'll specify that in the weekly tournament introduction.

Thanks again for bringing this to my attention.

Also, on another note, GOOD STUFF leptokurt! Those are going in the idea bank for sure.  happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]

Hi Everybody,

As some of you may be well aware, there has been some meaningful discussion happening over here [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=582949] with regard to these tournaments, and important decisions currently hang in the balance.

In the mean time, I want to offer a spoiler for next week’s tournament...

I’m offering this because I think spoilers are fun, and I think they can help build anticipation. Plus, I figure, if you’re reading this Ideas Thread, you should be rewarded for your curiosity. (I’m quite pro-curiosity.)

So, without further ado, next week’s tournament will feature:

Quest: Passage Through Mirkwood
Deck Parameters: Open Build, Monosphere Deck Only*
Number of Players: Solo Play – 1 Player/1 Deck

*In deck building for next week’s tournament, you may use cards from any number of available sets and adventure packs to construct your minimum 50-card deck. However, you may only use cards from a single sphere of influence + neutral cards.
 

As always, thanks for playing.

Announcement:

I’ve been learning a lot from hosting these first couple of tournaments. Important questions have been raised, and there have been some helpful discussions along the way. Now, while I imagine that the nature of how these tournaments are hosted will continue to evolve somewhat over time, what follows here are some key decisions that will help give shape to the foreseeable future. More precisely, I’m going to go with the following plan for the next 2 months and evaluate whether I will make any further adjustments to the system toward the end of January 2012.

Decisions:

1) Various Solo Player tournaments will continue to be offered weekly on a Sunday – Saturday basis.

2) There will be occasional planned breaks from the weekly Solo Player tournaments, and anticipated breaks will be announced ahead of time in the Ideas Thread.

3) Various 2 Player tournaments will be offered in the form of a monthly tournament (see here [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=582949] for the current active 2 Player tournament).

4) The frequency of future 2 Player tournaments may be adapted over time to meet the perceived level of interest in 2 Player tournaments, interest being measured by how quickly a competitive Top Ten begins to take shape during a given tournament. (i.e. where one week seemed too short for 2 Player, one month may prove too long.)

5) I am going to start posting weekly announcements (each Wednesday) about upcoming tournaments here to the Ideas Thread. That way, participants can start planning ahead for the next tournament, clarifying questions can be asked, and fine-tuning can be accomplished before the official tournament start date.

6) It is possible that a 3 and/or 4 Player tournament could be hosted at some point in the future. However, logistics have not been thoroughly considered, so plans for hosting such a tournament will likely follow at least a couple of 2 Player events.

7) The juicebox Top Ten Hall of Fame thread will continue to feature one Top Ten Hall of Fame list that highlights the ten highest compiled scores from all completed tournaments. This will serve to benefit those who play in all the various kinds of tournaments (Solo Player, 2 Player, and maybe some day 3 and 4 Player as well).

As always, thanks for playing.

Hi Everybody! It’s time for my first formal Wednesday Announcement!

Announcement:

There have been 3 juicebox LOTR LCG tournaments to hit the forums so far (JDtA and PtM for Solo Player and EfDG for 2 Player), and 2 of those tournaments are still currently active!

For those of you who have been playing/following along, you may have made the astute observation that in these first 3 tournaments we have been/are exploring the original 3 quests from the initial Core Set.

That in mind, for the week of December 11-17, I am going to take a break from hosting a new Solo Player tournament. This break will serve 2 purposes.

1) I want to allow some more focused time to take the active 2 Player tournament for a spin. I know several of you, myself included, have had the desire to play in this tournament but have yet to find the time to enjoy a 2 player gaming session. Well, to that I say… let’s LEEROY JENKINS this bad boy!! Seriously, let’s do this. You can find the thread here [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=582949], and I encourage each and every one of you (again, myself included) to give this first multiplayer tournament a proper go.

2) I want to allow some breathing room before launching in to the next big block of tournaments. For just around the corner, beginning on December 18th, the next wave of new tournament action will feature… you guessed it, the Shadows of Mirkwood series! For more specifics, check back next Wednesday.

As always, thanks for playing,

Wednesday Announcement: December 14, 2011

Number of Players: Solo Play – 1 Player/1 Deck

Hi Zjb12.

I'll be posting the new active Solo Player Tournament for the week of December 18-24 in a little over 10 hours.

Look forward to you joining the fray.

 As I look to start putting my player deck together, is there an easy way to distinguish the HfG cards from those of the other aps?

All of the Shadows of Mirkwood AP cards have a Set Information symbol and number in the bottom right hand corner of the card.

The Shadows of Mirkwood symbol is a little spiderweb.

In Hunt for Gollum, the Player Deck cards are numbered 1-9.

Good question. Hope that helps.

Also, for a more visual approach, you can go to: http://lotrlcg.com/ [http://lotrlcg.com/] and search, filtering for the HfG Expansion.

Thanks booored. I think something like this would be a great challenge for the next time I run a tournament for Passage through Mirkwood. That one specifically will need some interesting parameters like this to keep it interesting over time and worth the focus of a tournament.

Even a max of 2 Heroes would make replaying that quest more challenging. One hero, with all cards welcome, could make for some very creative deck building choices (including songs and splashing from other spheres). Thanks for the idea. I'll keep it in mind for the next time around with the Core Set quests.

Hmmm... good point. Maybe. Though if it's open build one could use Song of Kings and SoG on any hero.

One option could be to allow a participant to rank multiple times in the top ten that week as long as it is with a hero from a different sphere than they already used to rank with. Do you think that would encourage more experimentation? Then again, that could "over value" that particular tournament.

Restricting number of heroes does seem like a good concept to play around with at some point.  And PtM seems like a good quest for it.

Maybe using just 2 heroes would be a better place to start. Other thoughts?

 Hey Juicebox, I just barely became aware of these competitions you are hosting.  So far I'm having fun and I think it's a great idea.  Here are a couple thoughts I have that might shake things up a bit:

 

1) Have some kind of rule about how many times a scenario can be played.  Now maybe you can run two tourneys at the same time for the same scenario, one can be "play as many times as you want during the week" and the other can be limited.  Perhaps each player can only have 3 attempts or something (though I would still keep it a week long so people can mess with decks or whatever).  I just think that, though luck is an essential part of card games, being able to play 20 times, for example, increases the chances of getting a run of wicked good luck.  This puts the odds in favor of the people with no life :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] but it also takes away a bit of the skill, IMO.  I would like to just have a few chances to try to really get something right.  I might not always get a great score, but things would even out over several tournaments.  Which leads to my next idea...

2) How about a scoring system that carries over from tournament to tournament, like the mariokart model?  For example, give the first place finisher 9 points, the second place finisher 6 points, the third place finisher 3 points, and the 4th place finisher 1 point.... or something like that.  Then let those points accumulate throughout an entire cycle of scenarios, or whatever, and determine a champion at the end based on points.  This would take a bit more of a longt-term commitment in order to be competitive for the final prize, but it wouldn't prevent people from participating that only had time for a quest or two.  And it would still allow people to see their name in the top 10 and get some satisfaction for putting together a good game, even if they don't crack the top whatever number of spots get awarded points.

 

Just some ideas.  Thanks for doing this by the way.  I think it's awesome.  For such a young game, this community is great.  There are lots of fun and generous people around.

~Vase

P.S. I also think there needs to be some clarification about mulligans and the starting hand.  Technically, I can sit and draw as many times as I want because if I get a second draw that I don't like, I can just "forfeit" and start a new game, repeating the setup process to make it totally legal and honest.  But it's still a way to cheat the system and it's lame.  Of course, people can always cheat, but I'd like it if I knew that I were following a specific rule and that the people I'm competing against are at least claiming to be doing the same.  What do you guys think?

Thanks too for the great ideas. Limiting the amount of times a scenario can be played is quite intriguing to me. At this point, I'll likely keep things consistent with how they have been for the upcoming handful of tournaments (Shadows of Mirkwood Cycle), but then it may be time to shake things up a bit. And your idea has a lot of potential to play with. Perhaps players could be limited to 3 chances per set of heroes? So, if you've used a particular set of heroes 3 times, you have to switch at least one out (and then get another 3 chances with that new combo), and so on. That way, people could continue to deck build and play many times throughout the week, but they would be "forced" to try new things (not just the same powerful combo of heroes over and over until the "perfect" run of cards strikes). Perhaps a strict rule about repeated mulligans could be worked into this way of doing things as well - to make each chance more meaningful. In any case, all this is to say - great idea. I'm going to consider something like it for a future tournament cycle.

[That said, I'd specifically like to welcome other feedback around this particular idea over the coming weeks.]

As to your second idea, have you checked out the Hall of Fame? There's a link to it in my signature. Kind of captures what you're suggesting but will include every Top Ten tournament result over time for every tournament hosted. Should get more and more interesting as time goes on.

Anyway, thanks for the solid feedback. I agree with you about the greatness of this community. Glad to be a part!

Wednesday Announcement: December 28, 2011

Next week begins the start of not only a new week, but also a new month and a new year! We’re all looking forward to the long anticipated Khazad-dûm release, and this round of Shadows of Mirkwood tournaments continue to rage on. In short, these are exciting times! gran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif]

With both the 4th Solo Tournament and the 1st 2 Player Tournament coming to a close at the end of this week, January 1st will mark the beginning of two new tournaments. As foreshadowed, January 2012 will see us through the remaining adventures from the Shadows of Mirkwood cycle. Up next…

The next planned Solo Player Tournament will begin on January 1st, and this weeklong tournament will feature:

Quest: Journey to Rhosgobel
Deck Parameters: 1-3 Core Sets + HfG, CotC, & JtR Adventure Packs
Number of Players: Solo Play – 1 Player/1 Deck

The next planned 2 Player Tournament will begin on January 1st, and this month long tournament will feature:

Quest: Return to Mirkwood
Deck Parameters: Each Player may use 1-3 Core Sets + All Shadows of Mirkwood APs
Number of Players: 2 Players

As spelled out in a previous announcement on this thread (December 14th), I wanted to offer a second month long 2 Player Tournament before considering a revision to how long future multiplayer tournaments will run. I’m interested in how much “demand” there is for multiplayer tournaments. I imagine I’ll have a better sense of that after the December and January 2 Player Tournaments.

Also, I just wanted to mention that with it being New Years and all, I may be a little late in posting the close to the current tournaments, updating the Hall of Fame, and posting these forecasted new tournaments. But rest assured. It will happen. It may just be slightly later than usual. Happy New Year to everyone! Have fun and be safe. happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]

Players have to play the quest twice. Once with heroes A, B and C. Then with heroes D, E and F. All four spheres must be inluded.

 

 

Example:

 

First game you play with Beravor, Bilbo and Éowyn.

 

For the second game you have to use three different heroes and have to include leadership and tactics

Second game: Legolas, Théodred and Glorfindel

 

Game results would be added to a total score. You can even make it harder by naming some heroes that have to be used (or may not be used - yes, I'm looking at you, Éowyn!)

Mmmm... this has a very nice epic quality to it and would encourage people to break out of possible deck-building ruts they may have gotten stuck in along the way. I could imagine both decks having to be pre-constructed, so you're forced to use at least 100 cards (i.e. can't pull from your first deck to compliment your second deck).

I would go even further and say that in all single player tournaments, only one core set may be used.  Some of us only have one and there could be a disadvantage to that.

I only have one core set but I printed out cards and put them in the sleeves of cards I won't use.  Yes it is a little more time consuming but instead of going out and buying a new core set for just a few cards this is much better.

I don't think you have to limit the game to one coreset. They only card that IMO should be limited is Sneak Attack. The Hill Troll told me he's quite angry that they don't have such a card in the encounter deck. Heard him muttering something like "Sauron sucks...".

Question on the Top Ten List.  Guess I should have been paying attention but I didn't think the ultimate Top Ten list would include both the solo and the multiplayer options.  I figured they'd be seperate entities.  Some of us just can't make the 2 player thing happened (I got a second player twice in December to try the 1st multiplayer tournament and each time we lost.)  Also based on the numbers participating in the multiplayer I think there isn't going to be a whole lot of participants.  Would this be the place to dicuss how we want to top ten list to reflect multiplayer tournaments vs. solo tournaments.  Maybe seperate lists.  Maybe seperate lists with a grand list?

Hi Wraith428 and anyone else who may be asking a similar question...

It's a good question. It's one I wrestled with myself for a while. I made some posts on the topic early in the month of December and weighed options, soliciting feedback at that time for about two weeks before coming to a final decision. In the end, I decided to go with one overall compilation ranking system for the Top Ten Hall of Fame. For players currently like you and me (I'm in the same boat... only got in about four 2 player games during the entire month of December - just fortunate enough to have won one of them) it puts us at a disadvantage. On the other hand, it also motivates me to teach my friends this game and to seek out more opportunities to enjoy this game in a face to face social context (which in the long run will hopefully be good, both in general and for tournament play). Anyway, my decision landed with the compiled version of the Top Ten in order to purposefully advantage those who play the game in both its solo and multiplayer forms. Since the game was designed for both, I wanted to honor that. It's a cool part of the game design. Plus, I may want to start hosting 3 and 4 player tournaments at some point, and then I could imagine needing to create 4 separate Top Tens to follow the same line of thinking. Also, in general, it's less work for me to organize one overall Top Ten listing, and I want to make sure that I plan all this in a way that will help to keep it enjoyable for me (minimizing the tedious aspects of hosting) so that I can continue to host for a long time - to set it up to be more sustainable.

That said, there is nothing keeping someone (yourself or anyone else that would like to) from creating a thread that would feature multiple overall Top Ten rankings for Solo Player, Multiplayer, and whatever other ways of ranking that people dream up. Really, I've considered that it would be cool to have a ranking based on points per tournament (reflecting percentages or something) to give players newer to my tournament system the satisfaction of achieving a high rank even though it will take them a while to catch up (on the current ranking) with those of us who have been playing every tournament possible from the beginning. Anyway, I think that's a fun idea too. I just don't have the energy for it right now. But, if someone wanted to create that, all the data lies in the various tournament threads. It's just up to whether someone wants to take the initiative. They (you, if you want to do it) would have my blessing.

Thanks for your thoughts and for playing in and enjoying the tournaments. Your enjoyment shows, and it makes this game more fun for all of us. happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]

 Yo Juicebox,

 

Thanks again for running these tourneys.  I am having a blast competing with other players.  

 

Unfortunately, this week's tourney has rewarded luck and repetition more than all else.  Sure, the guys who came up with the creative deck-building solutions to beating this quest deserve to be rewarded for it.  But I, like so many others, spent most of my time shuffling, drawing new starting hands, and then getting destroyed by the "unlucky" encounters.  Unfortunately, after A LOT of tries, I never had that perfect storm come around so I didn't even get to post a score.  But I was planning on writing a post on this thread even if I had managed to get a good score.  

 

There is too much riding on repetition and luck, and not enough on initial deck build and creative game play.  If number of tries were limited, we would all have to think a lot more carefully about our deck build, and then we would be forced to play through the hands we drew, which would in turn force us to make good in-game plays in order to salvage the best score possible, even when there is bad luck.  In my opinion, this would be a better representation of who the better players are because, even though some will still get those lucky runs, the odds will even things out in the long run.  

 

It might be too late to implement some type of rule like this for the remainder of the Mirkwood Cycle, but perhaps after that something could change.  May I suggest you raise awareness of this idea to see if anyone else feels as I do.  If it turns out that I'm not the only one who would like a change, perhaps there can be some good discussion and maybe even some voting on rules.  I certainly don't claim to have the best solution for this situation, but I'm sure that as a community we can come up with a good compromise that can keep most everybody happy and having fun.

Vase, et.al.,

So, in reading your note, I both agree and disagree. 

I was one of those guys with a sub-30 score, but if you read the whole tournement log, you'll note I started out at 92.  Then 65, 52, 37, 33, 31, and finally 28.  I did play a ton of games and the perfect storm certainly has to brew to a point.  However, this week I learned a lot about some cards I never fully understood, (PoL in particular).  Before Wraith's 23, I thought the best score I could get was a 25 and that was getting 6 particular cards out of 11, (using 1x Sneak Attack on Gandalf to get an extra 3 cards during the game), and when that was managed, it just didn't work out.  Then he goes and throws Bilbo instead of Glorfindel and I think, Bilbo?  Really?  So I keep my whole deck, except make this one switch and all of a sudden my possibilities open up a little more.  Finally, a 28. Bilbo is more useful than I thought.

All this to say, I have really learned a lot through the tournaments, but in order to keep up with everyone else who understands the game a lot better and has played longer, I have had to play a lot, and really hard at times to keep in the fray!  If I was limited to how many games I could play for the tournament, I am not sure if my overall gameplay would have improved as much as it has as well as deck building skills.  For example, the same deck I used this past week for JtR, I also used with another person in a 2 player tournement for Mirkwood, and we took it out 2 games out of 3 and had the lowest score until yesterday.  (Not that there are that many scores posted mind you!)

On the other hand, I do agree with you that limiting the amount of games one can play to post a score would level the playing field a bit because it would make us think more and force us to play through as you said.

Overall though, if we were to do that, I think you would want to start out that rule change with something like, "In this tournament you are limited to 25 game attempts."  And then maybe start to decrease it from there over time.

Hope that all makes sense!

@Zjb12:

This is a very valid point.  I too have done lots of learning, and I'm sure I would continue to learn lots if I continue to play at this pace.  However, today (Jan 8) is the last real day of Christmas break for me.  Tomorrow I have to go back to school.  Balancing graduate school with a wife and two kids leaves little time for playing games.  I have to fit games in somewhere because otherwise my brain would explode and I would burn out from never having any kind of fun :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]  But still, it will be impossible for me to keep up with everyone if I have to continue to play at this pace.  

If I'm the odd one out and everyone likes the tourneys like this, then that is fine.  I'll just deal with it as best I can and still have fun.  I just think it is a bit extreme though, and the tourneys could do a little more to help the gameplay be more fun and a little less serious.  Of course, this is just my opinion and I understand if people disagree.  I certainly have nothing against serious competitiveness...except that I can't always participate in it :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Great discussion you guys... I'd love to hear more thoughts, perspectives, feedback around this aspect of the tournaments.

For the moment, to answer one point of your concern Vase, the remaining tournaments for this particular run through of the SoM cycle will remain the same - for continuity. However, there will be more tournaments after January, and there will inevitably be more runnings of the SoM cycle in the future, and I think there could be lots of room for a variety of approaches to a specific stand alone tournament or to a particular series of tournaments.

So, everyone... please chime in. Your thoughts and ideas matter to me.

 It is honestly hard to judge and the decision lies in your hands juicebox. I personally am biased toward allowing only a limited number of plays, because I am only getting in roughly 1-4 games per tournament.

But as I said, I am pretty biased, so I will actually "vote" for people having unlimited games, it is just more open, less restrictive and it is interesting to see those stellar scores and learn from that.

That being said, I am totally fine with making the Top 10 regularly on a single digit number of games, the scores mean jack in the end and I am having a good time, that is all there is to it.

 So i was thinking about this today.  Would people like someone like this:  1 week intermediate/expert level tournament.  Limited to 10 games.  (note: you must use either your opening hand or the mulligan replacement.  Reshuffling after a mulligan hand constitutes the start of a new game.). Submit your lowest score from up to 10 attempts.

Scenario:  into the pit.

Deck requirements:  limited to dwarf Heros.  The following cards are not allowed: any silvan or noldor cards; Protector of Lorien; galadrim's greetings; favor of the lady; horn of gondor; steward of gondor.  50 card deck, no more than 3 of any card.  

Reward:  those in the top ten get double points to be added in on Juicebox's current overall listing.  (so 1st would get 20pts, 2nd 18, etc.)

Thoughts?  Just an idea.

I love that idea. But there are only two darven heroes, so I guess you mean only the restricted cards may not be used?

And couldn't we just pretend that Gandalf is out of town, too?

 @leptokurt: hey!  I meant we could only use for our heroes those who are listed as dwarf, so Dain, Thalin, Gloin, Gimli, dwalin, and bifur.  I did consider nixing gandalf from play, but after getting my expansion pack yesterday and trying the first scenario: ouch!  Course this is all an idea, but if Juicebox approved, I'd be willing to run something like this sometime for him, as long as he'd include the points at the end.  Granted, you might try 10 attempts and get no score if you don't win!  Maybe we'd need to up it to like 15-20 attempts.

Wednesday Announcement: January 11, 2011

The next planned Solo Player Tournament will even further our present venture through the Shadows of Mirkwood cycle. Beginning on January 15th, this weeklong tournament will feature:

Quest: The Dead Marshes
Deck Parameters: 1-3 Core Sets + HfG, CotC, JtR, HoEM, & DM Adventure Packs
Number of Players: Solo Play – 1 Player/1 Deck

Get Ready!

Also, don’t forget about the current active 2 Player Tournament [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=595635] (Return to Mirkwood).

But wait… there’s more:

As a brief 7 point forecast, I want to share how I’m envisioning the next few weeks or so to go…

1) January 22nd-28th will feature a weeklong Solo Player Tournament for The Return to Mirkwood. (Yes, this will run concurrent with the 2 Player Tournament for the same adventure. We’re going to cap this cycle right!)
2) The week of January 29 – February 4, there will be a break from Solo Player Tournaments.
3) The current 2 Player Tournament will finish on January 31st.
4) Another month long multiplayer tournament will begin on February 1st.
5) I am going to wait a while to offer any tournaments that are Khazad-dûm related. (This is for 2 primary reasons. One - I want as many people to have access to those cards as possible before hosting a tournament with them. Two – I want to give us as a community time to work out any major questions that come up with the new cards before offering a tournament with them.)
6) During the month of February, I am planning to run a few Solo Player Tournaments that incorporate various ideas some of you have suggested in this thread, so keep the ideas coming…
7) There isn’t really a seven. I just felt like having seven things on my list. lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif]

Yeah, I like this. As I was just told that the german version will be in store in mid February. ( which is kinda odd given that all the other expansions released just days after the english on did)

So for me personally it means no Dwarves since end of Feb or even early March.

I would like to give my 2 pennies [http://middle-earth.xenite.org/2011/09/14/is-there-money-in-middle-earth/] regarding the discussion initiated by Vase last week.

First I have to say that I love these tournaments since they are such a great incentive to really play and explore the different scenarios. What really struck me during the Rhosgobel tournament last week though was that this kind of tournament tends to reward decks that are very scenario specific and/or inconsistent (decks that fail or get high scores most of the time but once in a while get very low scores). I don't say I am all against this, but in the extreme case this could reduce the game to just trying over and over again to draw the right cards instead of actually PLAYING the game.

One way to reward more consistent decks (and also mitigate the luck of draw) would be to have to play two or three games in a row and then either add up the scores or calculate the average. In this regard a fail could either equal a certain number of (high) points (which could be tricky since the average scores for each scenario are very different) or simply mean a fail (ie you would have to succeed in all games to get a valid entry).

In order to reward decks that are not overly scenario specific you could do as above but play DIFFERENT scenarios. You could even use some kind of "Nightmare rules" linking the games together, as long as it doesn't become too complicated (else it becomes easier to make mistakes and it might also scare people away if nightmare rules are too complex).

One drawback with both these suggestions is of course that it would take more playings to get a valid tournament entry, and I know that time is precious for many of us (I have three kids myself and do most of my gaming late in the evening/past midnight), but I really like the idea of linking different scenarios together somehow. I don't know what other people think though.

This is a fantastic idea.  I suggest combining this idea with something Juicebox said a while ago about limiting the number of attempts per set of heroes.  So if each player was allowed, say, 5 attempts (playing each hand they drew [one mulligan allowed] like Zjb12 suggested) per set of heroes, and then they had to average out the 5 scores they got, I think you could get a clearer idea of not only who is building better decks, but also who is a better player.  

 

With regards to time being precious, and believe me it is, I think I can sneak in 5 games a week.  I'm sure others would be getting in tons more, but I would still feel like I had chances to be competitive in the scoring if it was done this way.  And, most importantly, I think everyone could still have tons of fun.

I have a question....as long as we stick to the tournament rules, is there anything keeping us from participating using programs like LackeyCCG or OCTAGON in lieu of the cards?

I have 3 kids under 6 and a small house. This means two things, one, time is short. I spend time at lunch at work starting new games on LackeyCCG that I finish at home after the kids go to bed. The small house means, I don't have too much table space to just leave cards laying around while I am not playing. 3 Kids under 6 means, If i do leave the cards out, the usually do not remain where i left them.

Can we participate using LackeyCCG?

I had another tournament idea.  Just an idea, so feel free to kick it around.  Shadows of Mirkwood Nightmare Variant Part 1:  HfG, CatC, JtR.  Deck build:  Only Dwarf Heroes.  Deck size: limited to 50 cards.  Game:  To play through all 3 scenarios and come out victorious.  You are allowed to shuffle your discard pile back into your deck after each of the first two scenarios.  When starting a new scenario all cards other than heros return to the deck.  You are allowed to heal 1 damage per hero for free in between scenarios.  You are allowed to reduce your threat in between scenarios, (also free) by 5 per hero still remaining, (up to a total reduction of 15 max).  You are allowed 1 mulligan per initial hand draw for each scenario.  Finally, you may attempt to complete this scenario no more than 7 times, submitting the lowest score of the 7 attempts.  An attempt counts as soon as you draw your first hand for the first scenario.  Any forfeit counts as a game.  If you draw a hand and then take a mulligan and do not desire to continue on after that, it still counts as an attempt.

Too hard?  Thoughts?

Time for a dumb question ....  I've always assumed that there is a minimum 50 card deck size for your tournaments. Is this correct?

Maybe the deck size limits could be made clear at the start of the tournament in the future, we could even try different sizes.

Since the majority of players will have access to just the 1 core set, can we please have a few more events that only allow access to 1 set of cards?

I think the assumption is minimum 50, but not sure if there is a maximum, though most people know, the more you add over 50, the less likely to get the ones you want.  I think for this weekend I might say minimum 50 maximum 60; 1 core set plus certain aps.

Yes, minimum 50 card deck. Basically, my approach is that all the standard rules are to be applied unless a specific tournament rule is stated that trumps the standard rule. Personally, my bias is to have as few tournament rules conflict with standard game rules as possible. (ps - not a dumb question.)

Wednesday Announcement: January 25, 2012

Very exciting discussions and planning [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=606341] in the works to increase the level of our future homebrewed tournament scene here on the FFG LOTR LCG forums.

In the mean time, here is my announcement in preparation for next week:

1) For the week of January 29th – February 4th, I will take a break from hosting a Solo Player Tournament. Breaks are good, and I’ll be fine tuning a few ideas for some of the upcoming Solo Player Tournaments I’m planning to host in February.

2) January 31st will mark the end of the current 2 Player Tournament. So, keep watch for an updated Top Ten Hall of Fame at that time.

3) February 1st will mark the beginning of 2 different multiplayer tournaments! Both tournaments will last for the month of February. There will be another 2 Player Tournament, and I will host my first ever 4 Player Tournament. gran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif]

2 Player Tournament (#3)

Scenario: Massing at Osgiliath
Deck Parameters: 1-3 Core Sets + All Shadows of Mirkwood Adventure Packs
Number of Players: Two Players

4 Player Tournament (#1)

Scenario: Passage Through Mirkwood*
Deck Parameters: 1-3 Core Sets + All Shadows of Mirkwood Adventure Packs**
Number of Players: Four Players

*My main idea here… if you haven’t already, it’s time to teach some friends the wonder of this game. And what better way that to start with the very first quest? cool.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/cool.gif]

**In deck building for this 4 Player Tournament, each player may use cards from 1-3 copies of the Core Set + any Shadows of Mirkwood Adventure Packs per deck. (No need to record exactly what was used… I’ve decided to embrace the possible tie.)

Wednesday Announcement: February 1, 2012

Having just launched the third 2 Player Tournament [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=610527] and the first ever 4 Player Tournament [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=610530], I’m excited to announce that the next juicebox LOTR LCG Solo Player Tournament is also just around the corner!

The next three Solo Player tournaments will feature some new tournament mechanics, and I’ll be eager to hear your thoughts, feelings, analysis, and feedback - of all sorts.

Here’s the deal…

February 5-11, 2012
Scenario: Journey Down the Anduin
Deck Parameters: 1-3 CS + all SoM APs
Tournament Mechanics: Sets of 3*
Number of Players: Solo Player

*Sets of 3:
1)A valid result in this tournament consists of reporting your results from 3 back-to-back games, using the same deck for each of those 3 games. (Please observe the mulligan rule, and all other rules, from the LOTR LCG rulebook and subsequent official FAQ documents.)
2) After you post your results, the results from your 3 games will be calibrated using the RGun formula** to obtain your Weighted Result.
3) Weighted Results will then be ranked against other player’s Weighted Results in the Top Ten for this week’s tournament.
4) You may play and report as many games (in Sets of 3) as you would like (so you can try out different deck builds over the week).

**The RGun formula has been designed to value both Final Score (per game) and overall Win Ratio (from your 3 games, cumulative). The formula is: (Average Score of Games Won) x (Total Games Played/Games Won). For an expanded discussion on how this formula was created, you can read the thread called Measuring Success [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=606341].

I can’t wait to try out this new approach, and I eagerly await your feedback on what your play experience is like as you tackle this challenge in 3 game chunks!

As always, thanks for playing,

juicebox

I'm inclined to try the more open type build for a more combat heavy scenario and see how it goes (given that I'm wanting to run these next few trials as preparation for the possible launch of a Living Tournament system). Aside from unique tournaments that feature a variety of restricted lists in accordance with various themes or something, I'm disinclined to form my own "banned" list. My hope in this is to see what's possible within the current set of existing rules for the game. But, I hear your questions as thoughtful and coming out of some already thorough discussion on other threads.

I don't know if anyone has asked it this blatantly (well, maybe Glaurung has), but are we saying Beravor has "broken" the game?

 I have never played this will of the west/beravor deck.  I understand the concept, but can it really work when there are often so many other game elements going on, or do you basically only use beravor for this element of the game and never to quest, defend or attack?  Would it be enough in tournaments to limit will of the west or does it need to be both that and beravor?  P.S.  I feel stupid asking this, but Beravor---who is she in the books?  It is a she, right?

IMO she does break the game, especially if you allow 3 core sets. Theres a 50:50 chance that you will get one UC in your starting had which allows you to draw 5 cards. Soon afterwards you'll have the second UV etc - you'll have your complete deck drawn in less than 10 rounds. In the meanwhile you start to play GG and Gandalf's, you get them back by using Will of the West, so your threat will be down to 0, you'll have SoG and tons of cards - how is this not broken? If you don't believe it, use muemakan's deck and try it yourself. Once you get UC you have almost won the game.

 

I know people say that Glaurung sounds like a broken record, and I myself don't agree with everything he says, but in this case he's totally right. Beravor doesn't have to be banned though, it would be enough to limit her ability to once per round, similar to Glorfindel's healing ability.

AGoT has the rule that no player can draw more than 3 additional cards in addition to their normal draw per round.. perhaps a rule like that would be appropriate for this game?  (And an effect that "puts cards into your hand" doesn't count as "drawing".)

Uhm, we just changed the scoring system, but we will not have our own house rules in non-official tournaments, even if they make a lot of sense?

 

WE HAVE TO END BERAVOR'S RULE OF TERROR!

 

Or, to say it with Kant:

Enlightenment is man's emergence from his self-imposed immaturity. Immaturity is the inability to use one's understanding without guidance from another. This immaturity is self-imposed when its cause lies not in lack of understanding, but in lack of resolve and courage to use it without guidance from another. Sapere Aude! [dare to know] "Have courage to use your own understanding!"--that is the motto of enlightenment.

But, we're not changing the scoring system. Individual games are being scored the same. We're just creating our own method for ranking results.

I'm not against house rules (or what Kant said) either. Just - context matters. I'll share more thoughts on this later. (Have to make this one quick.)

House rules are house rules for a reason.. they are you OWN rules for making the game more fun for YOU. There is no way you will get everyone to agree on them.. drawing 2 cards a turn... crazy...

Juices idea is good, a scoring system that is FFGs own, using FFGs rules so everyone playing is in teh same boat and then using that tricky math to work out meta scores from a series of games played to give a better picture of deck strength and player skill.. GREAT idea for the community.. but if you add house rules it will be worthless.

As it stands, as muemakan has consistently shown, you win the tournaments with a deck that reduces your threat to 0 in about 10 turns. To do this you need these cards in your deck

 1. Berevor and Unexpected courage (to draw your deck)
 2. Will of the west (to cycle the combo cards)
 3. Gandalf (and either sneak attack or zigil miner/Gildor)

I think the deck design is really clever, but for me it is not interesting to play. It almost doesn't matter what the quest is, the deck does pretty much the same thing and I don't enjoy playing it, so I choose not to play that style of deck and I accept that players using that style of deck will get better scores.

If you want to add rules to a given tournament to stop this sort of deck winning, then there are many (already suggested) ways to limit it, such as

 1. Ban Berevor
 2. Limit Berevor's action to "once per round"
 3. Make Unexpected courage unique
 4. Remove Will of the west from the game once played
 5. Use a scoring system that doesn't include final threat in the score

Juicebox is very good and polling for opinions, and that it one of the reasons why we participate in his tournaments. At the end of the day, he decides what rules he wants and we decide if we want to compete using those rules. If all the top results are created using a draw/recycle deck then there might be a need to change the tournament rules so make it a more level playing field. I have confidence that, if this is the case, Juicebox will adapt the tournament environment accordingly.

If everybody is forced to play Beravor decks, playing tournaments is useless, unless there are two entry lists - one for Beravor players, one for other players. And why is using house rules making the scoring system useless? I'm not sure what you're up to with this, to be honest. ZjB's tourneys for example were so fun to play exactly because he threw in some house rules.

As my name came up once or twice I feel the need to participate.

I used my Beravor deck in 3 of the 7 single tournaments I played in the juicebox series.

So I can play with other decks and do it when playing with friends as the deck is not that fun to play if you play just for fun.

In order to address the problem with this deck just ban Beravor. Nothing more has to be done. Let all the other cards be. There´s no need to restrict or ban Sneak Attack or Will of the West or Gandalf. 

Just what I think.....

 EDIT: I just read some other posts. The thing with a 2 sphere deck ( no cards from other spheres not even via songs) kills the deck also quite effectifly without banning anything.

## 117 [juicebox on February 2, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56379-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-tournaments-ideas-thread-now-moved-to-player-community-subforum/?do=findComment&comment=588601)

So, I think part of what is tricky here is that I'm trying to accomplish two things at once...

1) I'm hoping that we as a community can refine this Living Tournament idea before launching it as a basic tourney system. When I consider setting up that framework, however, one of the goals I have personally is that it would facilitate playing the game as it is - or as it evolves (as designed by FFG). All available scenarios and cards represented, following all FFG rules and FAQ updates. I would hope that someone who has never played the game before would be able to purchases a core set, add some adventure packs if they wish, come to this site, and be able to jump right in the fun of a Living Tourney scene.

In my opinion, there are enough rules to learn in the game to have to further consider additional restrictions - and come to an understanding of why those restrictions where established. And that second part seems to be the bigger deal. We are all operating under limited insight as to how this games works and doesn't work (including the game designers), but if cards are to be banned for an ongoing system of tournaments that is set up to facilitate building decks from the entire available card pool, I want for the game designers to be the ones to make that call. That's kind of their job, as how I see it.

Yes, submitting scores in Sets of 3 (or whatever the final decision is regarding number of games in a Set) would be in addition to the expressed FFG rules. However, in my mind, we are simply creating a tool for helping to more satisfactorily rank player results in comparison with one another. Further, players would not have to do their own math to calculate their final meta/weighted score... they would just play three games and report the results. I want it to appear simple - even though we all (those of us who have been active in these discussions up to this point) know it's been a complicated road getting to this point.

If FFG changes the scoring system again (like they have already done once) or initiate a new rule (limited drawing mechanic for example) or create a banned list (ahem, Beravor), then we'll have to discuss at that point how that would impact our Living Tournament system, but I imagine that certain posted results in the Living Tournament system would need to be invalidated at that point or at least *'d with a note that the particular result came before the change.

2) That said, I'm also wanting to continue to offer juicebox Tournaments. I primarily view these tournaments as a way to experiment with various scenarios - placing interesting parameters and restrictions and what not. Recently, the tournaments have been a fairly straightforward "restricted" run through of the SoM cycle. I wanted to run that through to its conclusion for continuity and to learn together from the play-as-published experience. However, I have some ideas (thanks to great input from this online community) for future tournaments that would be more highly based around certain themes and would hopefully offer new twists on old scenarios. I see timed tournaments (a week, a month, or a weekend - like Zjb12's recent events) as ideal settings for exploring various interesting restrictions, theme tournaments, nightmare variants, etc... we are really only limited by our imagination. This is the setting in which I would want to experiment with various "house rules." Some juicebox Tournaments (especially the more experimental ones) may turn out as a flop, a great success, or somewhere in between. The fun (for me) will be in the trying, the discovering, and the sharing in that process together.

The tricky part (as I mentioned above) is that for this month, I wanted to offer a few almost "open build" tournaments with the main variable being the # of games played in a Set in order to get a feel for how that is experienced as a tournament mechanic. For anyone who's interested in giving it a try, the feedback will be quite helpful in "play testing" this mechanic in preparation for settling on a Living Tournament structure. Also, the first juicebox Tournament for Solo Player featured Journey Down the Anduin with only one Core Set allowed - so this will be a very different play experience.

All that said, I think the concerns about Beravor and the current FFG rulebook are quite valid. I hope it's on FFG's radar. In setting up future juicebox Tournaments (like from March onward, specifically), it will certainly be on mine.

That's not entirely straightforward to answer.  This rule was NOT in the game from the beginning of the CCG days.  Eventually they added the rule (in a FAQ/errata document) once it was clear that draw was being abused, and it seemed to help. (And there are a mix of "draw" effects and "take the top card of your deck and put it in your hand" effects, the latter aren't affected.)

However, when they "reset" everything to the LCG, they included this rule.  So as far as the LCG was concerned, that rule HAS been there from the beginning.

until people start recording their games with a camera or live in lackey and posting on YouTube I simply do not believe a lot of the "super" low scores.. I honestly think that the majority of people play completely wrong rules. Tragic for example was playing the Elenore could cancel 2 treacheries in a row with Elanor using UC.

This game is complex, and many scores.. especially the ones claiming outrages scores and people saying "this is to easy ban this" I simply do not believe they are playing correctly, and if they are they are only posting a small fraction of there games, witch are mostly catastrophic fails. Juices meta score system is supposed to claim this fixed.. but in the aJTR thread one player posted a 5/5 score... this isn't possible, in fact it was latter revealed he was using illegal cards.

This is the BIGGEST hurdle FFG has to get over when considering Torny play.. not ban and restricted lists and more and more rules on top of ****. They need to make a event were every single table has a judge. This is a co-op game, meaning no one is checking on you. This is a terrible burden on a event manager and oen of the mani reason that this game will never see torny play.

As we know tournaments system made for 2 players team. So is quite easy to judge tournaments then. Each team each step will get another team as opponent team. So each step only 1 game for 1 team. Cose 1 game can take up to 1 hour so there is no time for another try(that cose im against all this idea: 3 play against every quest and combine the scores...... physically there is no time for this on real tournaments).So first team play, second team watch and judge. After they change.

1 step 1 game for each team.Best scores win. Then next step  you can get anoter team as opponent, if you win you get another team who is also win so your judgment with every step will be more proff. And losers play with losers. Actually i cannot see any other solution for this game, otherwise there will be total cheeting around.

You righ Boored about : Players many times get rules wrong and play wrong. Even Traggic the B many times play wrong and he1 is one of the most active players so what we can say about others....... I long time already want to start my video session but dot really have time for this. But really want to do this.

About me :Sounds like broken record. Yes maybe but i know one thing: Water with time thin the stone. So i talk about Beravur for 6 months and now not only me, Many players start to talk about ban and errata for Beravur. So here is a part of my will too. Step by step and game will be really cool. I love the game  and just want to make it better.

Uh, what? He used cards that you made up a restricted card listwith a house rule (which is why by your own standards all of the results of your tournament are useless). I think it's clear that no deck will reach a 100 percent ratio for JtR, but with that Beravor deck you will get on average a far better win/loss ratio than with any other deck. And I'm speaking about decks that use only one core set, not three.

If we'd follow your logic our civilization would have no progress at all. Invent traffic lights? Hey, why make driving even more complicated than it is?

 

Also I have to say that I played enough games with muemakan to say that he's competent enough to play by the rules. His "outrages" scores are all vaild scores, though of course he played a lot of games to get them.

IMHO the simplest way to run a LoTR tournament is....da da da...like a duplicate bridge tournament.    Take two hero decks assign one northh and one south and a quest deck.  Players then MUST play with the decks assigned and thepotioins they are in.  NOrth players go first.  the tournament when they send youy to the next station assigns one of your team to north and one to south.

 

then after you have gone through say 8 or 12 stations however many players there are. you average out the scores.  That way all of the players are playing the same decks with the same qusts.  Forcing them to work with the cards given, since LoTr much like bridge, is going to be limited on the numbers of cards availale this could be challanging.  if you limit it to 6 stations and you have 24 players.. you make four sets of 6 stations.  Make it illegal, much like in bridge, to watch another game in process..  And go from there. 

 

Further more, you can thwo more wrenchs into the works by of course varying the kinds of cards enoucntered on the qu3ests instead of following the exat symbol.  My suggestion would be of course to have 48 cards repsent 16 cards of color specfici foreach heros resource and 2 gandal cards.  These decks are then built and give players 5 minutes to look at their decks and shuffle them and play out that scenario

 

after the 6 rounds have been scored the team with the lowest average has won

 

that is just my suggestion

The problem of this way is that it takes away the deck-building element of a LCG, it just challenges the participants on their skill on card-playing.

True but then again in duplicate bridge there is not a whole lot of hand building either.  It is a means to challange players to wrok with whawt they have in front of them.  You see the problem with the actual deck building idea is that LoTR is a cooperative game.  Whcih means that in order to have a tournament of any kind you need to pit the players through the challanges.  However, and we see this on MTG, there will be "deck types' and everyone will have those decks.  It further complicates things as your opponents can not really design a deck to counteract that current trendy deck.  If two people have the same deck well then what,  you can not have 2 of the same kind of hero.

 

The truer skill comes from working together to beat the game,  knowing all of the cards.  there is no sense of rarity, everyon has an equal chance of lhaving those car5ds.  they should then be working to play all of those cards to see the combos and to understanding the mechanics.  Forcing them to build decks or practis with all of the schools because you never know.  Any tournaments with this game would become too easily bogged down with the same old same old.  I am already hearing that a dwarf deck will be super strong.  HOw boring woudl a tournament be if everyone had a dwarf deck.  Maybe one or two peopel would build a complimentary deck but still you are faced with night mares of same heros etc....bah

 

Taking a duplicate bridge style of play will constantly make players look for other combinations and constantly be playign with all kinds of cards to get them familiar with everythign instead of just one.  To test their ability to play all of the schools and to work with your partner and talk to each other and work to get the best scroe.

 

Much like duplicate bridge is a cooporative game, and yes partners must cooporate, LoTR is also one but instead of other opponents you are going up against the game.It would remove the problems of the same kidns of decks and be hyper challanging.

As designers declare before tournament system will work fo 2 players who will declare themself as a team against other same teams. In this case in my opinion deck list required.

Wednesday Announcement: February 9, 2012

So this week’s Wednesday Announcement is a little tricky because… it’s actually being posted on a Thursday!

Continuing with a string of tournaments to garner feedback for the possibility of an upcoming Living Tournament System, I’ll continue to be eager to hear your thoughts, feelings, analysis, and feedback - of all sorts. For this next week, however, I think it’s finally time for one of my tournaments (now that a lot of the regulars seem to have received their copy of KD) to enter the mines!

Here’s the deal…

February 12-18, 2012
Scenario: Into the Pit
Deck Parameters: Open Build
Tournament Mechanics: Sets of 3*
Number of Players: Solo Player

*Sets of 3:
1) A valid result in this tournament consists of reporting your results (wins and losses) from 3 back-to-back games, using the same deck for each of those 3 games. (Please observe the mulligan rule, and all other rules, from the LOTR LCG rulebook and subsequent official FAQ documents.)
2) After you post your results, the results from your 3 games will be calibrated using the RGun formula** to obtain your Weighted Result.
3) Weighted Results will then be ranked against other player’s Weighted Results in the Top Ten for this week’s tournament.
4) You may play and report as many games (in Sets of 3) as you would like (so you can try out different deck builds over the week).

**The RGun formula has been designed to value both Final Score (per game) and overall Win Ratio (from your 3 games, cumulative). The formula is: (Average Score of Games Won) x (Total Games Played/Games Won). For an expanded discussion on how this formula was created, you can read the thread called Measuring Success [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=606341].

I can’t wait to continue playing with this new approach, and I eagerly await your feedback on what your play experience is like as you tackle this challenge in 3 game chunks!

As always, thanks for playing,

juicebox

Just one more note, summing up what I hope for next week's tournament:

1) Well... fun, of course.

2) Another trial of playing in Sets of 3. (We'll see how the discussion goes... I'm curious if anyone who actually plays in the Sets of 3 format ends up wishing it were organized in Sets of 4 or Sets of 5 - for the sake of a better experience, more balanced outcomes, etc... I guess I'm specifically looking for that kind of feedback after actual play experience before I feel good about offering a tournament that asks for Sets of 4 or Sets of 5, as my bias is clearly for Sets of 3, but I'm trying to remain open minded while looking for some general consensus.)

3) Khazad-dûm!!! Bring on a completely OPEN BUILD tourney!!!

New Announcement: February 18, 2012

Hi everybody... I can't really justify calling this a Wednesday Announcement, as Wednesday is just too far gone.

I do want to share a few thoughts though:

My sense from the forums, both from those who have enjoyed the player created tournament scene and those who don't, is that we may be experiencing a bit of tournament burn-out around here. That combined with the frustrating reality of the lack of content categories for these forums (meaning threads fall off the front page faster than you can start raking in the resources from a sprightly constructed Ziggy deck) has me feeling the need to take a little break from hosting a next Solo Player Tournament. The break may just be for a week, maybe a couple weeks... let's see how it goes.

In the mean time, in terms of evaluating possibilities for a new Living Tournament system, from the feedback there has been over the last couple of tournaments I have run as well as the ones that Zjb12 has run requiring results be posted in Sets, it seems that Sets of 3 is the way to go. I find it meaningful to have this feedback offered after playing through the tournaments. Feedback based out of experience is more meaningful than feedback based out of theory. So, for those of you who have offered your thoughts on the experience of playing games in Sets, thank you. If there's anything that's been left unsaid, feel free to chime in here. And another note about the Living Tournament scene... I've had some meaningful conversation with Darksbane over at CardgameDB about possibilities for hosting them there at some point. Also, there has been some initiatives to get forum categories going here. In either case, I'd like to wait a bit for a more ideal interface to exist before launching something like that. Once that's in place (whether it's on CardgameDB, here, or somewhere else - whatever reasonably comes together first), I think it will be quite excellent and fun and very much worth the wait for a quality Living Tournament experience.

After a break, the next juicebox Solo Player Tournaments will likely be quite thematic. Looking forward to those after some rest.

As always, thanks for playing,

juicebox

Thank your veeeeryyyyyyyyyyyy much for hosting these tournaments, Juicy! I enjoyed all of them! aplauso.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/aplauso.gif]

 

You're right that we apparently have too many touneys going on at the same time. I hope that your break won't be too long though. Perhaps it would help to give your tourneys a bigger timeframe, like, two weeks instead of one?

 

Amd Zjb, I hope that I can at least post one attempt for your tourney. The main problem is that I love ItP so much that I haven't even tried the other tow KD scenarios yet.

Thanks leptokurt. I really enjoy hosting them, and I've really enjoyed your involvement!

I think you'll have fun with some of the upcoming more thematic type tournaments.

And with more tournament options happening, perhaps a longer time frame would be helpful.

I may give that a try. happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]

Well everybody, it looks like we've got subforums!!!

This is a really wonderful day, and hopefully, it will serve to enhance the FFG LORT LCG forum experience for everyone.

I have already created a new (combined) The juicebox LOTR LCG Tournaments ~ Top Ten Hall of Fame & Ideas Thread [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=286&efcid=4&efidt=619212] for my tournaments in the subforum called Player Community. From now on, please post all thoughts and ideas and what not to that new thread. It's the new juicebox Home Thread.

My plan is to finish out the current active 2 Player and 4 Player Tournaments here in the general thread, but from that point, any new tournament activity I instigate will be in the Player Community subforum. I'm excited about this, I think there will be more felt freedom. I may even feel free enough to start an alpha model for the Living Tournament idea there in the Player Community subforum. Yes, I think I just may... so keep your eyes open for that too.

Good times ahead.

Signing this thread out... thanks for co-creating the joy that has been version 1.0. corazon.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/corazon.gif]
