Well, the answer to the question is probably that he is not splashable due to his hight threat. But my question is, what other good Gandalf decks have you come up with that don't include Glorfindel or Elrond? I really like Gandalf hero, but I don't want to build the typical Vilya deck with him. So, do you have any suggestions for a good, proven Gandalf deck that has not been posted before, with other than the typical heroes? Hopefully with Tactics or Leadership. I should also mention that I'm talking about a solo deck. Yeah, I know I'm lazy, but I want to read your suggestions.

For saga Gandalf/Aragorn(Leadership)/Pippin pipe deck is one that I like very much.

I have seen Gandalfdecks that use the Pipe Strategy. So Gandalf/Pippin/Frodo or even Fatty/Frodo/Gandalf.

I would call him one of the most splashable heroes of the game, if not the most splashable one. He was created with this purpose in mind, after all.

I put Gandalf in a deck with Aragorn and Gimli for my campaign play through and it worked very well. In general, the only problem is his high starting threat. Then again, his resources can be used to play basically every threat reduction event. So yeah, I fully agree with trololo. You can pretty much splash him in any deck with minimum adjustments. The only exception might be secrecy decks, for the obvious reason stated before.

I think that on easy mode it would be possible. I won couple of times passage through mirkwood playing with only Aragorn and no allies in deck. It needs good starting hand (steward and celebrian stone), but nothing more.

Just to be clear, secrecy will not be a case where Gandalf is not "splashable", because "splashing" term means combining several spheres in one deck, which has nothing to do with secrecy.

Gandalf/Sam/Aragorn (core) worked surprisingly well for me, despite reservations I had on the threat. It allows you to play mono-Leadership from the top of your deck (and I threw in a Song of King just in case...). Sam did have Noble Hero attached, but I think the combo would have been great even without that +1 willpower.

I tried pretty hard to make a solo Gandalf deck, as in he was the only hero. It was a fun deck. Run all of the good Lore and Leadership secrecy stuff and some sturdy and dependable 1-cost allies, such as Henmark Riversong and Snowborn Scout. If you can get a Timely Aid off on turn one or two, and get Resourceful going on Gandalf, it is pretty fun.

I thought "splashable" meant that you can include it in any deck and it will be helpful to some extent, be it in multi or monosphere. Splashing has nothing to do with combining several spheres as far as I know, and most secrecy decks will be multi sphere. Secrecy has to do with low starting threat, something Gandalf has a hard time doing with three heroes. With that said, I could imagine a secrecy deck with Gandalf and Glorfindel or Lore Pippin.

Nope trololo is correct, splashing means using a few cards from sphere C in a deck with sphere A or A/B. So, that's why I agree with him that Gandalf is one of the most splashable heroes of the game.

The term "splashing" in card games originates from Magic: The Gathering and is used to describe decks that use more than one color of magic (example: black and white). So, accordingly, in LotR it's only applicible to spheres. It has nothing to do with secrecy, mate. Being splashable is an ability to perform well within different sphered decks.

I can't believe we're arguing semantics. Wait, yes I can, and I'm joining in!

 

While "splashing" may have its roots in Mtg. I believe that its use has transcended beyond the mixing of a color pallet of magic. I believe that it most often used to describe any game element being lightly added to a deck:

- I have a Gondor deck but I'm splashing elves

- I have a healing deck, but I'm splashing card draw

- I have a defense deck but I'm splashing a will power boosting card

- I have a tactics deck deck, but I'm splashing leadership 

 

Plus, the link below shows the definition of "splashable" according to a Yu-Gi-Oh wiki. And we all know that Yu-Gi-Oh sources are the gold standard in card games!

You don't need to have a sphere to be splashable, you just need to work well within different-sphered decks. Which he does ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

 

Thanatopsis, since when Yu-Gi-Oh becaume a gold standard of card games? It always was and always will be MtG, no matter how I hate it (I consider MtG to be too archaic and bloated). And, the main point of your post can be summed up in one phrase - "you believe".

Apologizes, I believe that my humour was too dry.

 

But, it does demonstrate that another card game uses the term differently.

Just a note: If in solo, many Gandalf hero setups can still be questionable, he really shines in multiplayer, where his deck is not bound to do everything at once. In multiplayer he'll truly fit almost anything.

I built a fun Gandalf-Idraen-Eowyn deck that used gandallf and spirit's player deck and dIscard pile manipulation to accelerate resources (zigi, hidden cache, gandalf's staff and steward) then bring off sphere big gun allies (faramir, beorn etc) into play (gandalf and stand and fight). as long as you have eowyn and gandlaf, the second spirit hero could be lots of different options, but I liked idraen because of the built in reading and she's not spirit glorfindel. This deck works well solo and in multiplayer.

Gandalf is second most splashable hero, with spirit glorifndel holding the top spot (and probably always will). Gandalf fixes whatever problems a decks has, providing resources and card draw for tactics, willpower and resources for lore, more combat for spirit, and whatever it is that leadership is lacking I guess. He's great, and if you're going to play non-solo, you can build all kinds of interesting decks with him. But I like high threat aggro decks so he fits my play style.

I would place Gandalf over Splorfindel for one simple reason: Splorfinder requires (or heavilty implies) you to run some Spirit stuff at the very least.

I really dig Gandalf with Theodred and Sam. You can easily get to 6+ resources per round and have a lot of really great 4+ cost cards to take advantage of that (and synergize with Flame of Anor). Timely Aid is actually fantastic in this deck.

Gandalf, without a doubt, is the most splash-able hero released to date. He can pay for any card (made easy with his Pipe), give you card draw, resource acceleration, and shadow cancellation with his Staff, and his willpower, attack, and defense allow him to fulfill any role a deck may lack, and do it extremely well at that!

 

With the upcoming release of Shadowfax, he will become even more splash-able and powerful allowing him to function better in multiplayer (giving him ranged and sentinel in addition to whatever awesome effect it may have).

 

Glofindel may have low threat, but he is nowhere near as versatile as the Grey Wizard.

Just wondering,

Where you Lord of the Winds, Gwaihir? I miss him and his videos and I somehow I think you're related to him.

Well, at least it's got a little to do with it. Starting with a low threat level gives you some time to collect the required resources in a three sphere deck.

 

Anyway, the best hero ever and also very splashable is, of course, Théodred.

Alas, yes. This is Gwaihir. I have recently picked up a second job so I do not have time to make and edit videos anymore. I am sorry to have let you and the community down. I still get together at my local shop to play once a week, but don't have the extra energy for the videos. I do miss making them.

Here's why I think Glorfindel is more splashable, especially for solo play (and why many people think he's broken):

 

Splashable: easy to pair with any two heroes of other spheres.

 

You can take any two heroes and build a functioning deck with him.  He really only needs 2 or 3 cards (depending on how quickly you think you can draw LoV) and opens access to a few others (Asfaloth, the spirit staples like Test of Will and Counsel of Elrond), should you choose to build a little more around him.  He doesn't need to be the focus of the deck, you don't need to throw that many spirit cards, and he'll quest for three, attack for three every round for five threat.  If you're that worried about resources, you can throw in a song or an errand rider.  He is so easy to just throw into a deck that I don't use him that much anymore because I'm bored with him.

 

Gandalf requires a lot more thought.  You're going to have to include his Staff and Pipe, and probably Flame of Arnor.  Then you have to decide just how high will your starting threat be?  How are you going to mix and match the spheres of your other heroes?  How many cards will you throw in that only Gandalf can play?  How much readying and what kind can you include to get the most out of his stats?  What will be his primary role in the deck?    This is why Gandalf is a much better card.  You have to think about how to use him and build with him.  Glorfindel is often splash and go, you can build around him if you want to, but you don't have to. 

 

And this part is super subjective, but when I put Gandalf in a deck, I feel like I'm building a Gandalf deck, and the rest is how I want to flesh that deck out.  When I throw Spirit Glorfindel in a deck, I'm doing exactly that: throwing him in because he's really darn useful and easy to add in.   Which, to me, makes him the more splashable hero.

Can you show me some viable decks that have Splorfindel and don't have spirit cards, or have 3 spheres at once?

Well I didn´t record it so you will have to rely on my account :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

Been some while since I did it but iirc the deck was mostly centered around threat reduction combined with "O Elbereth Gilthonial" (pre-errata) and "Map of Earnil", lore providing the draw with Bilbo and "Daeron´s Runes" and leadership providing the resources with "Errand-Rider" and Théodred´s ability as backup to "Steward of Gondor" (seeing as the most expensive and important cards were spirit). And of course Asfaloth since I had lore access anyway. In the late game the errand-riders doubled as chump-blockers against the 2 trolls immune to Elbereth.

As I said, it´s been awhile so might have forgotten some details, but this should be about the gist of it.

Obviously a combo of the three best heroes should do the job! Theodred and Bilbo are such an awesome team, possibly one of the best hero pairings (especially for beginners, as they're easy to play) and Glorfindel has these super stats plus low threat.

Well trololo did ask for some more info on which kind of deck with Glorfindel could pull off a 3-sphere combo, so just thought I would share it.
