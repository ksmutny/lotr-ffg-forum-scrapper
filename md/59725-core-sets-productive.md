In case any one is curious, the number of core sets you need to build all 9 encounter decks for the Mirkwood Cycle is five.

Since you say 9 decks, I'm guessing you meant to say "Mirkwood Cycle + Three quests in core".  If you truly meant just the Mirkwood Cycle (which has just six decks to assemble), then you only need three core sets.
