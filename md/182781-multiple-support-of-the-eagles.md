The cards themselves don't exactly prohibit this to my knowledge, but I wanted to make sure what I did was possible.

 

- Legolas attached with 2x Support of the Eagles and Rohan Warhorse, 

- Eagles of the Misty Mountains with 2 facedown Eagles. 

 

1. Legolas gets to attack with 11 strength. 3 from Legolas itself and 2x4 from Eagles of the Misty Mountains. 

2. Put 2 progress tokens on quest.

3. Exhaust Rohan Warhorse and ready Legolas.

4. Legolas gets to attack with 11 strength. 3 from Legolas itself and 2x4 from Eagles of the Misty Mountains. 

5. Put 2 progress tokens on quest.

Yup, Support of the Eagles is a fantastic card.  It's just expensive and requires one other card on the table to work (so minimum 4 resources and enough draw to get both down).  Getting 2 down and operable puts you in a very good place!

Thanks! 

With Horn of Gondor and Eagles, Steward of Gondor every turn and Resourceful from support deck, resources aren't really a problem. 

The draw however is very dependent on luck it seems, since there is almost no card draw in my Tactics/Leadership deck.

Resourceful from a support deck doesn't work, as Resourceful can only be attached to a hero you control. Steward and Horn obviously are fine though, and should be enough.

Aha glad to know.

Haven't used it actually since I prefer to play it on one of my support heroes, but good to know I shouldn't even try.  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Until Sword-Thain comes out! It could be fun to build a secrecy deck that puts resourceful on a wandering took to pass him around to those in need.

Sword-thain has to go on a unique ally :\

Defender of the West + Sword Thain is the closest to a wandering took hero. And Emery just behind.

why emery?

Because Emery can be put into play under any player's control with her action.

Mmmmmmh, Wandering took can't be attached on him. He is not unique... isn't?

## 14 [Seastan on July 22, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/182781-multiple-support-of-the-eagles/?do=findComment&comment=1699831)

You are right I forgot it must be unique. I don't think Defender of the West would work either because it isn't an ally anymore. And if you put Emery into another person's play area, how do you get resourceful onto her?

 

I think to do this currently you would need to make use of an objective ally like Amarthiul. Once you control Amarthiul, attach sword-thain and resourceful, then send him to someone else. Does this not work?

Amarthiul doesn't belong to a sphere of influence and is therefore an invalid target for Sword-Thain. Same goes for every other objective ally in the game thus far.

True. Then nevermind, I can't think of a way to do it.

Aha, got it! Play Emery under another player's control and attach Sword-Thain to her. Then, pass Desperate Alliance to that player using Message from Elrond. The player then gives control of Emery to you, and you play down Resourceful. At then end of the phase you give Emery back to the player, with Resourceful attached.

 

Is it worth it? Probably not.

Emery and Swotd-Thain are not part of the combo.

Message from Elrond + Desesperate Alliance is a nice combo to give your Ressourcefull away (if they don't have secrecy and you do, otherwise Message form Elrond is enough)
