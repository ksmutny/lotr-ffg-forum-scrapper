I don't know about you, bot for me it's exciting news. Too bad it's not an LCG in the Old World's setting, yet still better than nothing! :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Looks interesting. Does it have a solo option?

It does! The product page says 1--4 players:

Sounds exciting but also makes me feel bad for the LOTR LCG. I can easily see the two games competing--and warhammer winning in the long run, due to simpler rules and/or lower entrance threshold.

I would bet on it. It's a co-operative game, after all. Even if does not supports 1 hero play, nothing will prevent a gamer from assuming roles of 2-4 heroes at once.

I can't see a competition here. They're different formats. And Warhammer quest in his format couldn't take a lot from LotR LCG as it won't have a lot of expansions and APs due to it being a regular board game and not an LCG.

Yeah, I'm glad it's not an LCG, otherwise it would encroach on LotR.  There seem to be a lot of adventure card games these days.  Pathfinder, Mistfall, a couple on Kickstarter.  I might need to wait a year or two for the dust to settle and one to emerge from the pack.

Yeah...was kind of hoping tha it was an lcg. While I am still enthralled with LOTR, I have been considering picking up PACG too to have another thing to scratch to solo gaming itch. Would have really liked to see a total FFG take on the genre complete with ongoing adventures.

Well, there is still almost zero info about this new card game. It may take a form like the PACG in terms of progression.

You speak the truth...we'll have to wait and see.

I'm excited to see another solo-playable fantasy-themed game from FFG. Despite being tempted by Pathfinder Adventure Card Game I have stayed away due to some average reviews, so I'm interested to see what FFG can do with a similar format. I'm assuming they will be similar purely because the term "Adventure Card Game" appears in the title of both games!

I was hoping the game would have had deck building mechanism prior to taking quest similar to LOTR:LCG without actually being LCG. I don't see any games like that on the market besides LOTR:LCG. Of course starter deck for each heroes would be provided but possibility through experience getting an access to new/stronger cards (cards could have a level requirement) and build a deck for the challenge.

Very pleased about this, as long as they dont go crazy with expansions and break my budget.. but then the article doesnt mention future expansions so maybe they are not committed yet dependant on sales.

Great to see a classic Warhammer product after what GW have just done to the world.

What GW just done to the world?

"The end of times" storyline whereby (i gather from forums, not got the books yet) they basically killed three quarters of the main characters, broke the old-world into bits in the warp, destroyed most of the major city locations, amalgamated army/races together (really, dark elves joining with the other elves), lizardmen basically gone, and other few more minor things. Oh yeah, also rumour of introducing a space-marine type of faction....

Google it, its quite shocking.

GW has stated that this isnt exactly 9th edition, rather is intended to run alongside 8th edition so that people who dont like it can still simply use 8th.

Again, this is info from forums, not actually read the six or so rules/story volumes yet (or is it eight volumes?).

So according to fandom, due to declining popularity, the basically broke Warhammer Fantasy along with its setting, in order to introduce a much smaller skirmish type game with much fewer product, more similar in style to 40k (which comically seems to be getting bigger in scale).

So, if all this is true (and googling seems to support it) as a longtime fan (started in 3rd ed but do own 1st ed) GW has basically broke it.... to an extent.

EDIT: ah, lizardmen still exist, thats good. If you google Age Of Sigmar you will get the skirmish game that is replacing WHFB.

I reckon this game looks a lot like Space Hulk: Death Angel. It has a support token mechanic like SH:DA and each player has 4 different actions to choose from, and from the sounds of things can only use 1 each turn.

 

Hopefully it's slightly easier to beat than SH:DA though!

Seems to be a kind of transition from the Old World to 40K.

A big "meh" from me. But I've never been a fan of Warhammer. :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

Should it be a reimplementation of (or something similar to) Death Angel, I'd probably buy it. I became very interested on Death Angel, but hesitated on buying it because of the theme. Then, LOTR came.

I doubt it's reimplementation of Death Angel. The components are too different overall.

Yup does seem that way. Seeing as there already is a 40k I dont see the need (other than GW cash-cow).

Id rather they left WFB as it was, even if they wound down production amounts and stopped expansions (should have stopped rule revising years ago anyway).

Dont like the idea of it, but then I have the choice not to buy. So for me WFB seems to have ended with 8th Ed, drawn a line under. I have my books and armies so can always play it :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I wouldn't think of this game as a competitor to LOTR. It's more of a different option and I imagine a ton of overlap between those who play LOTR and those who will pick this one up. It also provides a fantasy adventure card game fix for those who aren't interested in deck building at all. But I don't think it will have any impact on LOTR sales or the like.

 

I did play the original Warhammer Quest board game back in the day, so I was super excited to see this one announced during the In Flight Report. It seems like a great adaptation of that board game into a card game form, with certainly some influence from LOTR itself.

Not yet. It's supposed to come in the mail today, and I'm planning on doing a review of it as soon as I can get a few plays in.

Mine arrived but shrinkwrapped until Xmas. The reviews on here and BGG have been excellent though.

I've been playing it at least once a day since I got it. Great game, lighter than LoTR though and has no deck building (which is a plus or minus depends who is looking at it.)

 

It is a lot easier to teach than LoTR for sure and has some similarities. It only has 4 phases per round making it simpler to pick up and has questing/attacking/support as singular actions on each of the heroes. So while not exact I can definitely explain some of the LoTR terms in WH as I'm planning on using it to get people hooked in then get them playing LoTR. :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Still waiting for my copy to arrive, watched countless videoreviews, playtrhoughs and so on, though.

 

I like what I'm seeing.

Definitely good. And there are a lot of potential options for custom content in the quest sheets without necessarily needing new cards.
