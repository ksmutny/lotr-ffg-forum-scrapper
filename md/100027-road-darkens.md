I saw The Road Darkens on Ebay and it doesn't say pre-order or anything.  It estimates on the shipping that it would reach me in 4-6 days!  What the heck? 

 

Whats up with this?   http://www.ebay.com/itm/The-Lord-of-the-Rings-LCG-The-Road-Darkens-Cheapest-International-Shipping-/390777235374?pt=Games_US&hash=item5afc2367ae [http://www.ebay.com/itm/The-Lord-of-the-Rings-LCG-The-Road-Darkens-Cheapest-International-Shipping-/390777235374?pt=Games_US&hash=item5afc2367ae]

the listing states (in the first sentence, hehe): "You are looking at a new The Lord of the Rings LCG: The Road Darkens. This is a pre-order / pre-sale."

hah, that is going to backfire on them... It looks like it's just one game seller on ebay, discount_game_store.  But check this out from lower on the page:

 

"You are looking at a new The Lord of the Rings LCG: The Road Darkens. This is a pre-order / pre-sale. This item is currently being re-printed by FFG as listed in the upcoming section. It will be available guaranteed within 30 days. Included are all the components.  These items are brand new. Buy with confidence - check out our feedback!"

 

Well, definitely this is NOT available yet.   Not expected til quarter 2 at the earliest, and we know how that usually goes.... maybe you will have a copy of The Black Riders arrive at your doorstep! :\

Wow I didn't see the part that said "You are looking at a pre-order....."  <_< [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_dry.png]

 

I didn't order it since I knew it wasn't available but I wonder what would happen if you did order it.

 

I apologize for wasting your time with this mistake.
