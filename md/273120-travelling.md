Hi all, 

If I complete a stage of a quest do I still have to travel to locations in the staging area before going on to the next stage? 

Thanks,

Dave

No. But i seem to detect some confusing there.

When you complete a stage of a quest, you imediatly reveal the next one.

 

As for trave:

Travel is always optional. Either you choose to travel or not and explore the locations in the stagging area with cards like Asfaloth [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Asfaloth-FoS], Northern Tracker [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Northern-Tracker-Core] or Legolas [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Legolas-Core]

 

You only do it if you want, despite recomended due to removing threat from stagging area.

Just a note, Legolas doesn't place progress on locations in the staging area; just the active location if there is one. If not, his progress goes straight to the quest.
