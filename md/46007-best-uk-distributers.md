hey all,

 

a question to uk gamers, which store, online or otherwise did you use and intend to use again for LOTR the card game? i usually  use ebay for most of my online buying, and i bought the core game off it, however i am doubting if they will have the expansions on anytime soon

I bought my copy from Games Lore.  They're my "go-to" online store for just about all my gaming needs.  Never let me down yet...

I eventually got mine in Manchester, at a specialised roleplaying shop called Fanboy 3, but Forbidden Planet and Travelling Man were stocking them in Manchester too, and the FP Liverpool will most likely get it - so in theory there may well be a store near you stocking it. Amazon.co.uk had it on their site, but last time I checked it wasn't in stock. None of the expansion packs are listed on Amazon as yet, even though Amazon usually lists things months ahead.
