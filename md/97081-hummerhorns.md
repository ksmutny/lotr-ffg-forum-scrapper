Sorry i dont know how this card works, i mean can that ability trigger if i engage this enemy.

This card have also 5 victory points so this is really poor enemy if it doesnt activate its ability.

My thought has always been that as soon as you engage something, it is now engaged with you... otherwise it wouldn't attack you. I haven't found anything in core rules or FAQ, but I assume his ability fires off either way.

It doesn't mather if you engage him with a card effect or through the optional engagement, the effect triggers. In this game, there is not distintion betwen an Enemy engaging you or you engaging the Enemy.

It's in the rulebook, p.16:

"Whether an enemy is engaged through an engagement 

check, through a card effect, or through a player’s 
choice, the end result is the same, with the enemy 
and the player engaging one another. In all cases, the 
player is considered to have engaged the enemy and the 
enemy is considered to have engaged the player."

Dori can take this damage right?

Yes he can, but he doesn't have any more chance of surviving than any other hero that isn't holding a Citadel Plate.

Though Dori is an ally and I would rather loose an ally than a hero

Dori is in the Hobbit: Over Hill and Under Hill expansion.
