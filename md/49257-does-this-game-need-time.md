 I really want to get this game, but money restricts it from being an instant purchase. My concern is if this game could allow for an instant win deck. The WoW TCG has raid decks but on player controls the raid deck so it's less mechanical. 

Just wondering how this games system controlled villain deck makes sure players can't make an "I win" deck against it.

Curator,

The game is a blast.  I highly recommend it. 

To your question, there are mechanisms to help avoid I win situations.

 * Multiple scenarios (3 in the core set with additional ones lined up in smaller expansion packs) with varying victory conditions
 * For the 3 scenarios in the core systems, there are quest phases that have to be completed in order.  In general you need to handle them one at a time
 * Combat against creatures has a potential variable through a card effect that can throw some curve balls at you so that even if you were pretty sure you were safe, bad things can happen

Obviously with just the core game out, there is a lot that can happen and your concerns could be realized.

Yes, the game allows for instant wins. I played Journey Down the Anduin and had both trolls out by the end of turn one. That was an instant win for the forces of Shadow.

 

I wish this game had an instant win for the players, I could use a win these days...

There are a few things this game has going for it that helps to avoid that situation, though they could be seen as issues in and of themselves.

1. A lack of an effect resolution stack. This makes it impossible for you to negate actions with "Counterspell" type cards, or to save your heroes or attachments when things don't go as planned. This makes planning ahead more important and reduces the ability you have to respond to random effects.

2. Limited card synergy. There isn't the same level of interactivity between the cards in this game when compared to a more traditional CCG/LCG like Warhammer Invasion or Magic: The Gathering. This means that you can't build chains of events or have unstoppable combos, yet.

 

As far as just giving the game time, I probably would wait for a few adventure packs to be out for the best experience. I've got my copy shelved until we get more card variety (At the current rate of release that may be a while) and some more card synergy to let decks work together.

 Block. Reveal a card from your hand. Play it next turn. Search for a queen.. That's all you need, man.

This game is good, but the card pool is pretty limited for now. If you've got a few dedicated gamer friends, go for it. you'll probably have fun with it.

I am not a card game pro at all, but i love this game as a strategy gamer and a Tolkien fan. 35€ is imo a great price and 12€ for each adventure pack is more than fair!

It think its real strengh lies in coop play, and the best is its 100% wife or girlfriend compatible :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Of course the adventure packs will add a lot of value and their release will be great fun each time!

Make it 99 %. My girlfriend never got over "what's the point of the game"? I tried explaining you had to put those green markers on 3 quest cards, but she never got it (probably the fact she never read Tolkien nor saw the movies and hates fantasy in general is a bigger factor, but what do I know?).

i posted questions about this here: http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=516009 [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=516009]

do event cards offer this sort of "counterspell" ability?

@Reno

Not that I can think of. For example, one trick in MtG is to buff a creature after it gets hit for damage to save it like Giant Growth (+3/+3 until end of turn). Since Giant Growth resolves first, the creature gets big before the damage hits kills it. So the Lightning Bolt (deal 3 damage) which would've killed a 2/2 now cannot kill the 5/5.

 

However, the healing mechanic in LOTR doesn't have an interrupt effect on the game. The full amount of damage from an attack has to be put on before you can do anything about it. In LOTR a single attack of 5 damage will always kill a character with 5hp. This is probably intentional as it makes the game much more difficult and different from MtG. Similarly, you can't "in response" exhaust characters to get some benefit out of them after they are killed. Beravor's ability can't be put on a stack to resolve before she is killed. This makes you have to be extra careful.

The answer to your question for now is yes.Wen you will learn the scenarios and what enemies and locations you will face you can build a deck wich can win most of the times but....

but i don't think that this is the point of this game.Sooner or later after some games even an idiot he will find a deck to win the scenarios.Again i don't think that this is the point.I see this game like a travel to Middle-Earth.Somethink like, ok first i want to make a deck with my 3 favorite heroes and see how well it will go.After that a dwarf deck an elf deck etc.

My only promblem with the core set as a Bilbo playergran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif] is that ffg chose to give us 3 heroes wich they are not from Tolkien's lore.Just imagine Eomer at Eleanor's place or Boromir at Thalin's place. Ofcourse AP's will fix this(i can't wait for Frodogran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif]) but for now i realy don't find interesting to play a deck with Eleanor or Beravor just to win or just because they have good abilities.

Finaly i think Boromir players must wait for tournaments to show how good they are at deck building gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif].

For now is difficult to say what will happen in the future but now is for sure game is very unbalanced. There is already have a deck with one is impossible to lose.

In solo game maybe you still cam lose but in Coop game start to be walking in the park. This is very wrong and nothing to do with adventures joy. Adventures must be DANGEROUS other wise is boring. If after fourth of fifht turn youy understand you win becouse you know the encounter deck, you now what coming next and yoy half half of your deck in your hand  lot of resources. I call this kicking the baby( i mean encounter deck). I hope hunt for gollum change it but many report say the quest even more easy then core set quest. So if there is no challenge what we must to do????

I dont understand this.  Coop game i dont want t play anymore we win all teh time. Even we play and reveal 3 cards in 2 player game. Still we win easy.

Very strange balance in this game.If not Tolkien I already sell my core set long time ago.  I dont think game will have a big future. Otherwiise they must change balance , reduse the crazy draw  cards every turn with lore and really start to work to make quests more interesting and dangerous.

The idea of the game is briliant anyway i hope ffg will do everythink right.
