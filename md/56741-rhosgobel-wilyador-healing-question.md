 Hi!  Probably someone has already asked this, but does the forced notation on 2B of the quest remove character cards like as Radagast and daughter of nimrodel as allies form the game, or just healing done by event cards?   Thanks!

Rhadagast will be removed from the game but you can play another copy. Daughter of Nimrodel only heals heroes.

 That's what I figured on Radagast, and I guess I wasn't thinking clearly on the nimrodel card.  Thanks!

 Just got this AP and had the same question as the OP.  I have already searched the forum extensively so I had already found the answer.

 

I have another question, however, that I didn't find an answer to.  It is regarding the "removed from play" rule: If I use Radagast to heal Wilyador, then remove Radagast from play, but I have another copy of Radagast in my hand, can I play it?  In other card games I have played, if a specific card of a unique character is removed from play, then all other cards pertaining to that persona become unplayable.

Vase,

Nothing in the rules that stops you from playing a second or third copy of Radagast in the situation you describe.
