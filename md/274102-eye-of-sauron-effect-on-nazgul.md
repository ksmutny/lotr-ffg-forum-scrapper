Engaged Nazgul do not follow the Eye yet that seems like they should given their utter subservience to Sauron. (and would create an additional strategy element in Epic Multi-Player) 

Am I missing something?

You're right that engaged Nazgul don't move, but Nazgul in the staging area do move.  Makes good thematic sense to me.  If the Nazgul had found the Ring-bearer and was currently in the process of hacking him to bits, he wouldn't fly off to the Black Gate just because Sauron turned his gaze.

They go where Sauron commands, not where Sauron looks.

We know that Sauron finally found the Ring after Frodo put it on in Mount Doom and so his attention (the Eye) turned toward it.  The Nazgul who were fighting Aragorn & co at the Black Gate immediately flew to Mount Doom, which seems to suggest that the Eye reflects not just Sauron's attention but his command. (they had the Heir of Elendil within their grasp)   

I think this is what makes the text re the staging area seem thematically problematic.  I have pondered whether there is a game reason for the restriction but have not really come up with anything and so am thinking about proposing to my group that we ignore the restriction.

So... if the Ringwraiths always follow Sauron's gaze, are you thinking it is not physically possible for the Ringwraiths to go in different directions from one another?

I think so, at least at that point in the story; his gaze was essentially synonymous with his command on where he wanted them.  From a game play perspective I also think it makes for the interesting possibility that a player about to be overwhelmed by Nazgul (probably the Wraiths on Wings) could be saved when the Eye moves.  in general I really like how the Eye provides a strategy element in Epic Multiplayer, I just think it was un-thematically limited by the reference to the staging area.

Sauron the cyclops/chameleon!

I gotta disagree, I find your interpretation to be .. radical. 

As for gameplay, having all of the Ringwraiths move would make the game a lot easier.  You could "un-engage" very tough enemies at will.

Hmmm...I think my interpretation is pretty well backed up by the story.  I think it is much harder to ascribe any sort of independent will to the Nazgul, which is not to say that they acted as robots, as they certainly were acting with some independence while stalking Frodo in the Shire.  I just don't see them doing anything--including fighting--unless they felt it was their master's will.  In game terms this interpretation would create the possibility of evading engaged Nazgul by letting the Eye move, but that may well be exchanging one set of problems for another, which is why it makes the strategy of paying 3 threat to keep Sauron's attention all the more interesting.

No, I completely agree that the Nazgul follow Sauron's will. 

You're saying that "the direction Sauron is looking" and "Sauron's will" are exactly the same thing, making it impossible for him to command Nazgul to be in different locations at the same time.  As in, you agreed above that it's physically impossible for them to move in different directions. 

I'd say that's not a commonly held interpretation and would be surprised if the designers had interpreted it that way.

Just a point, if I may. The Witch King, being one of the nine, displays a strong independence of will while still working on behalf of Sauron.
