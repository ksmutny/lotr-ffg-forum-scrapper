I am just curious when most of you started playing the nightmare PODs.

Yeah was wondering the same. I tried the first one of the core set and was easily overwhelmed.

When it was released.

 

CORE nightmare pack was released in last GenCon 2013 if i remember. In october we could buy it.

I think that I tried them right around the time they started being released. Myself and most of my playgroup have been playing since the very day LoTR LCG was first released. So, over time people have fine-tuned certain decks so well that we can easily beat a lot of scenarios. When you find yourself going into a play session already knowing that you are going to win, almost regardless of draw, etc., then it is time for nightmare mode. 

 

I absolutely hate the feeling of relative certainty about being able to beat a scenario. I want to lose. I want to lose most of the time. If that doesn't happen, the game loses its appeal for me. Nightmare Scenarios are a good way to breathe some fresh life into scenarios that are not as fun to play anymore due to them being easy.

I buy the nightmare scenarios the moment of their release (like every product in this game) but I actually don't play them much. The set up more of a pain than I generally feel like dealing with and after I defeat one of the nightmare scenarios I'm normally so mentally fatigued I rarely play it again anytime soon ha. I haven't even touched the following nightmare quests I own:

Journey to Rhosgobel (the original was already one of my least played quests so I haven't tried nightmare)

Return to Mirkwood (I don't play a ton of multiplayer which is a must for this tho I do want to try it)

All 3 of the 1st hobbit box quests (still newer and the originals were already difficult)

Haha sorry bud, I'll get to them eventually. Been replaying the first two ring maker AP's a lot with the time I have to play; really enjoying them (even tho I do like your videos)

I've tried the Nightmare quests a few times with my friend, we usually end up getting creamed, regardless of the quest we play. I can't wait though for the Redhorn Gate Nightmare Deck, since it's my favorite quest.

Can you clarify what you mean by "CORE nightmare pack"?

My bet is on Passage Through Mirkwood+Journey Down the Anduin+Escape from Dol Guldur.
