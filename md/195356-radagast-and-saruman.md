We really need some good versions of these cards.  It kills me that Radagast sucks so much.  I'd love to see a Radagast or Saruman hero (or both).  I don't understand for the life of me why we have a Grima hero and no Saruman hero.  What would everyone's hero version of these two Istari be?  

 

Mine:

 

Saruman: Neutral

Threat 15

 

W: 3

A: 5

D: 2

HP: 5

 

Once per round, exhaust Saruman to take control of a non-unique enemy in the staging area.  That enemy leaves the staging area and enters your play area.  The enemy has 0 willpower.   Return it to the staging area at the end of the refresh phase.  If Saruman readies, return the enemy to the staging area immediately.  

 

Radagast: Threat: 12

Lore

 

W: 2

A: 2

D: 3

HP: 5

 

Radagast's resources may be used to pay for creature allies from any sphere.  You may spend one resource from Radagast's  pool to heal 1 damage from any creature in play.  Once per round you may exhaust Radagast to look at the top 5 cards of your deck and add one creature card revealed to your hand.  Shuffle your encounter deck afterwards.  

 

Of course there'd have to be versions of each of their staffs as well,  hopefully no rabbit sled for Radagast though.

I like these ideas, we may yet get a Radagast and/or Saruman hero.  For Radagast I would rather have a Creature effect that worked on enemies instead or as well as ally Creature traits. 

 

For Radagast something like "Exhaust Radagast to choose a non-unique Creature enemy in play, that enemy cannot attack this phase".

I am really hoping for a new Radagast at least. I would actually like if he could play with the top card face-up. I have been always very critical to the ally version, I really think it could have had three willpower. At least recently, I got a good use out of him in a Gandalf-Elrond-Beorn deck where he can be used well for Word of Command and even get a second Wizzard Pipe (in addition to his usual tricks -- which are not that many).

I’m fine without a Saruman Hero. Thematically it’s a little wonky as we’ve already seen him as an enemy (though we do have an ally so…) but my real gripe is that I do not like unique player cards that duplicate encounter cards. I get that it kind of has to happen in the Saga expansions but beyond there I would be quite happy to never see it again. It’s no big deal for those that purpose-build decks for a given scenario but for those that try to build a single or set of decks for the whole game it can be a real pain.

 

Would love to see a new Radagast though. Hero or Ally. For Ally I think he could slot pretty well into the Neutral slot for the Lore-Elrond/Leadership-Galadriel, 3-cost, discard at end of round ally. Something like: [3-cost], 3/2/2/4. At the end of the round, discard Radagast from play. Response: After Radagast enters play, choose one: Reduce the cost of the next Creature, Mount or Eagle card you play this turn by 2, place 2 progress on any location, or heal all damage from one ally.

 

Now for the Hero…the obvious ability would be something along the lines of giving a discount to Creature cards but I would rather do something we haven’t seen as much of. And Radagast is an Istari so he should feel powerful (despite what Peter Jackson thinks), but in a very different way than Gandalf or Saruman.

 

What about something like: Neutral Hero. [11-threat cost], 3/2/2/4. Resources from Radagast’s resource pool may be used to pay costs for any Creature, Mount or Eagle cards. Action: Exhaust Radagast to put a Creature or Eagle ally from your hand into play. That ally gains: At the end of the round, shuffle this card back into your deck.

 

This is a powerful effect, no doubt. But I don’t think it’s too powerful. The Eagles (where he can facilitate effects from Eagles of the Misty Mountain, Support of the Eagles, To the Eyrie and The Eagles are Coming) are his obvious wheelhouse but the Mount synergy could help give him some legs elsewhere. And it would open up some cool design space for us to see some more Creature cards beyond the Eagles (wolves, maybe, as a counter-point to wargs?).

 

And thematically I think it just makes a lot of sense. Radagast doesn’t command the awesome powers of Gandalf or Saruman. But while they were shaping nations and ages he was learning about the creatures and beasts of Middle-Earth and he is shown to have great influence with them.  

 

Neutral hero could become a resource problem but you could always fix it with something like: Radagast’s Staff. Action: Exhaust Radagast’s Staff to give Radagast a printed resource icon matching the sphere of all creatures in play until the end of the phase. Or something like that.

If they made up their own names for the Blue Wizards? And they don't use colours anyway, right? So we could get five in the end, just the two would not be Alatar and Pallando.

I'm with you on his ability, but even the Gandalf hero only has 3 for all his stats. IMO, Saruman shouldn't be a hero card based on his character but if he was, I'd wager his stats at W: 2, A: 4, D: 3. Some might argue that his will should be higher because his strength was the ability to control one's mind but that would translate to attack.

 


Saruman: Neutral

Threat 15

 

W: 3

A: 5

D: 2

HP: 5

 

Once per round, exhaust Saruman to take control of a non-unique enemy in the staging area.  That enemy leaves the staging area and enters your play area.  The enemy has 0 willpower.   Return it to the staging area at the end of the refresh phase.  If Saruman readies, return the enemy to the staging area immediately.

That ability is way too strong. For no extra cost than exhausting you cancel out 2 enemy attacks(1 for the controlled enemy, 1 you can defend with your new *minion*) get 1 free attack(with your minion) and/or kill one enemy.(your minion dies defending or he kills another enemy afterwards). Nothing would prevent you from readying Saruman afterwards(unexpected courage and so on) and still attack with him.

 

Taking control of enemies will never happen in this game as you effectively cancel out too much pressure from the encounter deck

I see your point, but a 15 threat hero who only gives neutral resources is a steep price to pay for that ability.  Exhausting him is losing you a LOT of stats too.  Plus, Saruman SHOULD BE powerful.  Besides, I really don't think he's more powerful than Boromir.  I've regularly seen Boromir cancel 8+  enemy attacks, taking no damage, then attacking each enemy back in turn.

Well, Saruman was unquestionably more powerful than Gandalf the Grey.  15 starting threat is insane too.  Also, while Gandalf's are all three's, 5's aren't unprecedented.  Beorn has 5.  Treebeard easily can get 8.  Granted Beorn is a giant bear, and Treebeard is...well...treebeard.  But Eomer attacks for more than Gandalf usually.  As does Boromir.  

 

Also, good point about the will.  I was thinking about that but on the other hand his will was broken by Sauron in a way.  He did stray away from the path the Valar had set him on. But I can see your argument as well.

Ok I know this is years late but what about:

Saruman

Will:2

Attack:4

Defense:3

Istari Noble

Neutral

Play with the top card of your deck revealed. Once per turn saruman may pay for any card in your hand. When doing so treat him as having the printed lore spirit leadership tactics sphere.

Whenever a nonunique location or enemy is put into play, you may discard the top card of your deck to discard that encounter card if its cost is greater than or equal to its threat. Limit once per phase.

 

I really like this idea because flame of anor and wizard pipe will still work great with him. Also, he can't play the top card, but his resource ability,represents the saruman of "many colors." finally his ability represents sarumans knowledge of the enemy. I gave him the noble trait so he can use the palantir, or the palantir can be erratad to equip to him as well. I haven't thought of a great radagast card yet,  synergy with eagle, ent, mount, creature cards is obvious,direction. Having ability to get them into play isnt enough for me because ents entered exhausted. Maybe ability to get them in hand? Or maybe something else entirely... I don't know. What do yall think of this saruman? Too powerful?

So in solo all I have to do is fill my deck with high cost cards to never have to deal with any enemies or locations? Don't you think that's a little too powerful?

At this point I don't even care half as much as I did before what our possible Saruman and Radagast heroes would do... I just want Caleb to get on with it and make them. After pretty much 2 cycles mostly comprising some very tertiary characters or FFG created characters, it's long due for us to get some powerful Istari for a change...

That doesn't seem too powerful, even if you fill your deck with high cost cards, if you treat them as out of play until the end of the round you're still going to have to deal with them next turn

And maybe for radagast, he gets a discount for playing eagles/ents/creatures/mounts... I feel like all istari should play with the top card of your deck revealed so that they can work with wizard pipe and flame of anor. Radagast could have an ability where he halves the cost of such cards. That would be great for eagles and ents?

I agree, but I think that they should each do something different with that knowledge.

EDIT:

Like perhaps Radagast cares about the type of card on the top of the deck and Saruman cares about the cost.

I disagree. I think it would be nice if they all interacted with the top card in some way, so as to make Wizard Pipe and Flame of Anor useful with them. But that doesn't necessary mean making the top card visible. In fact, I'd rather have anything but that, so that the ability combos well with hero Gandalf rather than being redundant.

I actually don't think all Wizards should work with the top card of your deck, I'd even say that's something only Gandalf should do. My personal vision of Istari heroes is that they should be neutral, and each should have their own gimmick NOT to play with the top card, but to gain recource icons in order to play stuff. Gandalf gains the icon of the top card of your deck, but Radagast could do that for your discard pile (though in my custom version I could never make that work), or maybe Saruman can play 1 sphered card per phase, but that card gains Doomed, something like that. Though I could understand if they didn't do this if they wanted Wizard Pipe to work with all Istari, but that's really unnecessary IMO.

Ive been thinking a lot about your fan cards. The more I think I about them, the more I think they should definitely use these for the game. They are very thematic, especially with all the doomed cards from The Voice of Isengard Expansion. Perfect with Grima, the only thing I would change would be to reduce his willpower to 2. This is along the paradigm of Gandalf's stats, his heroe stats are 1 less than  his ally stats. Otherwise I'm honestly thinking of printing this as a House card. I really want to play pure theme in the Voice of Isengard Expansion with Rohan, but they possess only one lore hero. Saruman and one other lore hero would balance this, and be perfectly thematic

What about a Radagast hero, neutral, plays with top card revealed, once per turn can pay for the top card of the deck if it's eagle or ent, half its cost rounding up?  This would be perfect as he was a servant of Yavanna.

Radagast was also said to be a "changer of shapes", they could make a double sided hero, both sides have different stats/abilities?

Radagast was a "master of hues", could once per turn pay for any card as if he has printed sphere.

Thoughts?

Plat the top card of your deck would be very close to gandalf effect. What about that:

Radagast 11 threat
1 willpower
1 attack
3 defense
6 PV
Play with the top card of your deck revealed. As long the top card of your deck is an eagle each eagle ally gain +1 willpower and +1 defense
Action: discard the top card of your deck to choose an eagle ally in your discard pile: put that ally on the top of your deck. (limit: once per round)

Saruman 12
0 willpower
4 attack
3 defense
5 pv
Choose an ally. Raise your threat by one and give it +2 willpower or +2 attack. Discard this ally at the end of the turn. (Limit: once per round)

Why everybody hates Saruman so much? 0 willpower, has to BOTH raise threat and discard the ally to give it +2 willpower OR +2 attack.

Hate Saruman? It is really better to have 0 willpower instead of 1 but costing 1 threat less. There is already too many 2/2/2/4 heroes so I like to dispatch more the points. Raise the threat seem logical because the doomed ability is build around orthanc. I think sacrifice the ally is quite normal. You can already abuse from many 0/1/2 allies cost. The best ones are the two Rohan and the eagle who already have to die at the end of the phase.

## 33 [Seastan on June 20, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/195356-radagast-and-saruman/?do=findComment&comment=3379103)

I have a whole set of Istari custom cards that I've designed that I keep updating when I think of improvements. These are the things on my design checklist for Saruman and Radagast in particular:

Saruman:

 * Combos well with doomed
 * Combos well with Grima
 * Combos well with Gandalf
 * Combos well with Wizard Pipe
 * Still useful outside the above combos
 * Is neutral, but is able to use his resource pool to play cards of any sphere under some restrictions (this is what I feel should be the unifying Istari mechanic, rather than "play with your top card faceup", which is redundant when you control multiple Istari).
 * Ability is not a wall of text (this one is the hardest to abide by!)

Radagast:

 * Combos well with Creatures, and Eagles especially
 * Combos well with Gandalf
 * Combos well with Wizard Pipe
 * Still useful outside the above combos
 * Is neutral, but is able to use his resource pool to play cards of any sphere under some restrictions.
 * Ability is not a wall of text.

So as you can see I impose a lot of demands upon each card, and it's tough to fulfill them all while keeping the ability short. But below you can see my most recent attempt and let me know your thoughts. I come up with new ideas for these characters every few months so I won't be offended if you don't like this particular version! As an exercise, I invite you to consider how each ability fulfills the above bullet points.

These are fun! I like the overall concepts.

Re: Saruman, can a player really "trigger Doomed 1"? It's obvious what you mean, but currently player card Doomed is only defined as quoted below, so I think you'd need an extra rule of some sort:

I figure it's pretty obvious what you're supposed to do here, but yes the rules for doomed would technically need to be extended to cover this.

I couldn't agree more. I left the game at the beginning of the harad cycle but I'm looking to get back in now that its over. I'm still blown away there's no Saruman or radagast. I play this game specifically for the Tolkien stuff. Some ffg characters are fine but id like the stars to be characters I love from the stories. I'd also love to see a powerful lore galadriel hero. 

Sauron was afraid to attack Lorien pretty much just because of her after all.

Cool ideas here, put me down for wanting a Saruman hero as well. I would love to see something like

Saruman 12

Willpower 1

Attack 4

Defense 3

Hit Points 5

Istari, Isenguard

Ranged

Action: Exhaust Saruman and spend all resources from his resource pool to put the top card from your deck into play, this does not require a resource match. That card gains doomed 2.

Whenever you raise your threat from the doomed keyword, deal 1 damage to an enemy in the staging area. 

 

## 39 [player3351457 on October 9, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/195356-radagast-and-saruman/?do=findComment&comment=3496368)

So I was thinking more about Saruman and palantir today, and how they might combo with the Istari trait. I thought of this:

"Play with the top card of the encounter deck face-up. While the top card of the encounter deck has 'doomed x' keyword, Saruman is considered to have leadership, lore, spirit, and tactics resource icon. At the end of the round, the players, as a group, must raise their threat by X where X is the threat of the top card of the encounter deck."

This works well with palantir because you get the top card for free. It's also a form of scrying, but dangerous to play in single player since you have to take the threat hit yourself. While there are others playing with you, you get the benefit of being able to spread out the threat, but only a portion of the flipped cards. I also must point out that as shadow cards are dealt out, there is no player action window, so you avoid the game breaking possibility of all shadows being dealt *essentially* faced up (flipped before they are passed out).

This version kind of whiffs on the wizard pipe, unless you can get some mining involved or you are trading junk for the top of your deck. But I was curious to see what you guys think, if this is too powerful or what stats go well with this version. The doomed x keyword makes him appealing only in specific scenarios.

Gandalf's, and therefore Saruman's, ability is a passive effect; not an action. In this case, shadow cards would be common knowledge. You could change it to "Action: turn the top card of the encounter deck face-up . . ." AFAIK that would avoid the problem.

My worry is that with an action, if it is not triggered near the end of the round, players can avoid the threat jump. I get the issue however, so maybe a card effect like this is not possible, at least the way I am envisioning it to be.

How would they avoid the threat jump? That same card would still be face-up. If it's dealt as a shadow card, they have the choice of re-triggering Saruman or not.

I just want Caleb to get on with it and make them, honestly. With the very slow pace of releases and previews the game has lost A LOT of momentum for me, and I don't think I'm the only one. At this point I just want the game to get more Wizard heroes seeing everything else is being covered.

I think you're right (I hope you're right, assuming we're ever getting R&S heroes), especially considering what Caleb said in an article about saving up and spacing out important characters to keep player's attention. The difference with Elrond was that he was released in the second cycle of the game. The problem with saving the big guns for last, particularly when the game has slowed down to a pace that's less than half of what it used to be, is that players eventualy get tired of waiting.

I mean, sure, we might get them in the very last release of the game. But is it really worth it when during the game's life itself, when you actually got to play and test new quests and see the game evolve, you never got to play with them?

Last AP of cycles (so far)

Mirkwood: Dain Ironfoot

Dwarrowdelf: Elrond

AtS: TaTheoden

Ringmaker: Erkenbrand

Angmar: Arwen

Dreamchaser: TaImrahil

Haradrim: Quickbeam

Some big hitters here, Dain, Elrond and Arwen are definitely power-deck staples.  How did Erkenbrand make it on this list?

More wondering about Tactics Theoden and Quickbeam... Not that either are terrible, but both are fairly niche. Also, it's interesting the 3 out of the 7 are tactics.

Theoden is at least a big name in the books, while Erkenbrand doesn't get a line of dialogue (he does get some praise in his absence, though).  I personally have used TaTheoden more than Erkenbrand, I don't think he's any more niche than SpTheoden -- he's a decktype enabler, not a utility hero.

Quickbeam's problem is just that he's too recent.  If he'd been around in Ringmaker/Angmar times he'd be in a host of Ent decks, and I think he'd make an outstanding tactics splash in any lore/lore/tactics deck.  Self-readying hero with 2/4/1/5 stats?  Not niche.

## 50 [Kjeld on October 10, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/195356-radagast-and-saruman/?do=findComment&comment=3498913)

I just meant that TaQuickbeam seems best suited to work as a splash card into Lore decks. His utility seems quite low when paired with Spirit or Leadership (you'd be better off running Beorn, I'd argue). Likewise, TaTheoden works far-and-away best with mono-Tactics decks, and his utility is dramatically reduced outside of that combination. They just don't compare with Dain, Elrond, and Arwen.  Basically, I'm not convinced that there's enough evidence for the "final AP pack will have a big hero reveal" hypotheses.

To me, there aren't a lot of situations where Quickbeam is the obvious choice. I mostly see people want to use him, so they make room for him in a deck and build around it.

Cool Saruman. I like him being able to play any sphere because he was "Saruman of Many Colours". And only thing I would do differently is have him ready himself from playing Doomed cards (limit once per phase) and have the Palantir exhaust to search your deck for a doomed event card. Showing him casting his spells but hurting while helping all of the other players the whole time. But I really like the staff, you could even add in/switch out a part to the staff that lets you drop another player's threat by 1 or 2.

## 64 [breedlove2 on July 29, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/195356-radagast-and-saruman/?do=findComment&comment=3749783)

I thought about giving his staff threat control, but there are very few attachments that do that, let alone attachments that stay in play to consistently reduce threat. So I'm not sure if it'd be OP.  The palantir attachment would ready him from playing doomed cards, there actually is already a card "seeing stone" that lets you search your deck for a doomed card. Finally I think the staff should emulate gandalf's and radagast's in that it is flexible, such that there will rarely be a turn in which it is not used (also we need location control. I'm constantly playing 4 player games, we like to play thematic, so we don't always take the pathfinder or asfaloth, it'd be nice if they released more location control).

After getting a lore Radagast, what do you think the chances are of getting a leadership or tactics Saruman this cycle? I know a lot of people are suggesting leadership, as he is the leader of the white council, but it might be cool to see him as a fierce fighter. His ally version is stacked high on attack and I wonder if they would do similarly with him. The only heroes with base attack above 3 are quickbeam and beorn, neither of which can take much else in terms of stat boosting. I'd like a high threat, dangerous tactics hero to pair with grima.

## 66 [breedlove2 on July 29, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/195356-radagast-and-saruman/?do=findComment&comment=3749810)

I like the idea of Saruman being multisphere, represents his vast knowledge of the enemy (and yes, Saruman of the many colors is thematic).  It makes sense for Radagast to be restricted by sphere (and basically with strategy, you have to take creature allies with him.).  But I don't think it would be good for Saruman to be restricted this way, personally.  I think he should be more like gandalf, viable in a great many different combos

Valid point forgot about The Seeing Stone. And still not sure about him helping the others with threat thematically, but your version is solid gameplay-wise and would really help the Doomed mechanic, especially since a lot of the Doomed effects are greater than 1.

Well I pretty much stole it from John Constantine [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/250511-john-constantine/].  It's literally the perfect way to balance all of the player doomed cards.  I can't imagine a better mechanic, and I'm unsure if fantasyflight will even produce a better ability for Saruman. Then again maybe it's broken? Because of Grima, and the power of doom cards. Maybe saruman's ability should be action advantage when your threat raises, or drawing cards, or both.... I don't know, but I'm getting tired of waiting for him. I might just print these out and try them in our 4 player games. See if they are too OP or not.

Bruuuuuuuuuuuuuhhhhhhhhh I don't want it to end. They should go back in time, make quests for the last alliance (Gil-Galad hero? Celebrimbor?

I made mass threat reduction on playing Doomed for Saruman as a way to offset the inherit disadvantage Doomed mechanic has in multiplayer. Sure, there are fair cards like Deep Knowledge or Legacy of Numenor, they affect all players and it's only right their threat also affects all players. But then, there is "local" stuff like Herald of Anorien, Mirkwood Pioneer, and most importantly - Grima. It is unfair to punish the entire party for the advantage only one player is getting, in case of Grima - 1 resource, which makes him virtually unplayable in multiplayer. That's the flaw of the Doomed mechanic, it cannot target just the right player. So what I did with Saruman's ability is just try to make Grima and non-global Doomed stuff playable in multiplayer.

I even tried to patch this issue up in my "fix the game" pet project long ago:

Yeah, the idea is genius, it's so good I'm not sure fantasy flight can think of a better one to be honest. 

If they make a crap Saruman, I might just go with this fan one anyway.  I also agree with the other guy (a while back) who said that only gandalf should see the top card of the deck.  So either Saruman belongs to a sphere, or he has mechanics to play with other spheres. Since his threat is so high, and if his ability works with doomed (meaning threat will get higher), i think that making him playable with all spheres is fine. Also remember, that this fanmade Saruman doesn't protect players from non-Doomed threat, so it's definitely not broken. And many of the doomed cards are greater than doomed 1, so there is in essence still a cost (just mitigated). Finally limiting it to once a phase is cool (also mirrors gandalf's once a phase ability).  This will encourage players not to play more than 1 doomed card a phase.

 

Seriously it's a great core mechanic ability for Saruman.

Hmmm instead of having all printed icons, maybe Saruman should gain a printed icon whenever you raise your threat?  Only downside is you'd have to bring doom to use him (or attachments to give him a sphere)

Ok, I think is more balanced. He can even be used without any doom cards (although why would you? it'd be like taking gandalf without his pipe).

Why would Saruman, from the thematical aspect of the card, or any of his toys, reduce the threat of other players when playing Doomed cards?

- Saruman is the head of the order (interaction with Istari keyword?)

- Head of the white council

- Is the maia sent by Aule and has a lot of knowledge about the rings (interaction with Artifact keyword?)

I'm really hoping that Saruman will appear in this cycle somewhat tied to the Master keyword (or Doomed, that would be good too). The themes and usage of the word "master" (as in The Master Ring) and the idea of power to control others is a very important one in Tolkien's writing, and is perfectly represented by Gandalf and Saruman. Gandalf is a "good leader", not adscribing power to himself but instead renouncing to it, and while he's powerful, he's more concerned with helping others reach their goals and achieve power themselves, while he stays as a pilgrim, a wanderer. Saruman is the complete opposite. He couldn't trust anything to anyone, and had to control everything himself, thus becoming a lord with a stronghold and army, a master with other minds and bodies to control for his own goals. He becomes a "master" in the sense Tolkien uses the word, more related to the theme of slavery rather than being a "master at something". (On this note, only Bombadil could truly call himself Master as he was the sole, and only a, master of himself.) So yeah, as soon as I saw the One Ring player card and the Master events we got in the deluxe, I knew the themes of power and corruption were lurking behind them, and so I really really hope this cycle will bring us Saruman and other cards and themes related to powerful, dangerous artifacts like the Palantiri and the art of ring-making.

"Why would Saruman, from the thematical aspect of the card, or any of his toys, reduce the threat of other players when playing Doomed cards?"

Have you not played the Voice of Isengard expansion? Notice the theme of doomed cards ? (as well as isengard?).

Does this not represent Saruman's role in forestalling the enemy? For those who don't know, Saruman didn't just arrive and turn. He fought against Sauron for about 1700 years before his mind began turning to possessing the ring so... reducing the Doomed element actually seems pretty spot on from this perspective (and you know, tying it in to all the literal cards which are obviously thematically tied to Saruman being Doomed...).

As far as all the other things, yes obviously some more istari cards would be great.

I am not saying it is not thematical that Saruman interacts with the Doom keyword, I think it is actually very thematic, very much like Grima does.

What I don't see thematical at all is that it reduces other players threat, I don't see but a pure mechanical intention to make doom more playable in multiplayer, I see no theme there.

But hey, that is my opinion.

I see mass threat reduction as both perfect mechanical and thematical fit. Mechanical fit is obvious, thematical fit is that Saruman was working with these forced for a long time and mastered them, so he is able to mitigate the downside while working with them.

From a thematic perspective it represents Curomo's ability to study and understand the methods of Sauron.  Not only does it aid directly against Saroun, prolonging each player's time by reducing Doom from the encounter deck, but it also allows the players to utilize all the methods and knowledge Curomo has gathered, in the most effective way (yet still dangerous, which is perfect for Saruman).

I'm not sure if they'll think of a better mechanic.

And thematically, honestly I think it's genius.  Threat represents the most vulnerable way to lose the game for the players. Threat represents The Enemy's awareness of you the heroes.  Saruman has the ability to obfuscate that, to buy time. Sure there are cards to reduce threat, but only a few heroes actually reduce threat, and it is either small and negligible (beregond, galadriel) or costs precious actions (merry).

This version of Saruman would have a much more significant impact (particularly in encounter decks that have doomed). But even outside those decks it allows you to utilize the dangerous knowledge Saruman has gathered, for little cost (in some cases no cost).

 

To me it feels like that it represents Saruman's ability to DIRECTLY counter Sauron. When Saruman first came to middle earth, he went into the east (and perhaps the South?)  to confer with the blue wizards and gain their insight on the state of the realms under Sauron's control.  He then went on to directly help Gondor in many conflicts (fun  fact: gained Orthanc that way).  And even when his mind changed towards gaining the ring, he was still using his knowledge to counter Sauron (drove him out of Dol Guldur by the "machinations of Saruman").

What better ability to show he is the head of the order, perhaps the most significant challenge to Sauron during his time than by safeguarding each player's threat from doomed?

You can achieve essentially the same effect with less text with the following:

"Reduce the X value of the first Doomed X triggered each round by 1."

And wording it this way makes it seem like Saruman is better at using Doomed effects, rather than reducing everyone's threat, which seems counter to the Isengard archetype.

Actually he should increase other players threat by corrupting them ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

One other possibility is to make him a hero that can not have other heroes in his deck... To emphasis his solo attitude.

Reducing threat is not counter to the Isengard Archetype, it is counter to the Valour archetype :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Correct. The Isengard Archetype is raising threat. Reducing threat is essential to that archetype. Either way the function of his ability is the same. But I think it should be once per phase, I've actually already tried this out in a couple of games now (well, 2 anyway).  It didn't "feel" overpowered to me (play a lot of nightmare).

It doesn't feel overpowered, because it doesn't gives you an advantage, it (partially most of the time) mitigates a disadvantage. Plus, it is printed on a very costy hero.
