For those of you on the lookout for the Mirkwood cycle... the reprints of all six APs are shipping to retailers now (see the "Upcoming" page).

Has anyone actually seen any of these available to order in the UK?

I have looked over the main selling sites but can't see any ... unless I am late to the party and they were sold out on pre-order ages ago :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

It usually takes a couple of weeks for them to arrive in the US after changing to "shipping now", and 3-4 weeks to get to the UK. You'll probably see them available in June I would imagine.

https://www.chaoscards.co.uk/ [https://www.chaoscards.co.uk/] have them in stock now. I ordered the last 3 packs I needed to complete the cycle yesterday and have them on my desk now! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I wish you hadn't told me, I've just spent £100 on the first cycle and a few nightmare decks. And there's the EXPO on Sunday. Tough month !

I'm in the same position with the Dwarrowdelf cycle - I'm just waiting patiently for that boat to arrive.
