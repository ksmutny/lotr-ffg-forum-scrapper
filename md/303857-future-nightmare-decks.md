Haven't found the answer to this anywhere so does anybody know if they have said if they are going to make Nightmare decks for the last two saga expansions or for the last three cycles?

I'm curious if I need to make room for them in my storage.

I can't imagine anyone knows definitively, but if I had to hazard a total guess I'd go with "NO."

Which is too bad if so, as we still had the Sagas to finish (in case mount doom and black gate weren't hard enough for you already haha). At least they finished my favorite cycle The Dreamchaser. Looking forward to get into them as I just got my first nightmare pack for Christmas.

I'm guessing no as well, which is to bad. I was hoping to battle Gothmog on Pellenor Fields. :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]
