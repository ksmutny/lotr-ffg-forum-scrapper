Personally, I'd like to see a decent deckbuilding 101 for the game. A proper breakdown of ratio between allies and other cards, useful combos and such.

Might be this is for you then.

Just kicked it off with an article about deckbuilding (more to come)

 I find your articles to be quite helpful to us newbies. Keep it up!

You are welcome, shipwreck.

Btw, not sure if you recognize me, but I am the guy you played with over OCTGN recently ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

I am interested in reading you articles: I agree with what the Big Show already said. A nice Deck Building article would be nice (on a regular basis). By the way, didn't someone else on here start one of those already?

## 14 [plueschi2 on August 1, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/66326-i-am-thinking-about-starting-a-series-of-articles-about-lotrlcg/?do=findComment&comment=667303)

As far as deckbuilding goes, I have 3 articles at cardgameDB already. You can find them here:

javascript:void(0);/*1343858594372*/ [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/index.php?/tags/ccs/deckbuilding/page__search_app_filters%5Bccs%5D%5BsearchInKey%5D__database_1]

The other articles in between take a short break from deckbuilding theory in one way or the other and I think some people would prefer for me to finish the deckbuilding series in one go. Personally I like to mix things up with topics that might fit around my deckbuilding series, for example my last article talked about the concept of soft-countering, while the current article (not being of the theory type) takes a look at one combo that does exactly that (soft-countering, enemies that is). I hope that those articles somehow will feel "interlaced" to a certain degree, nor sure if I succeed though.

Cool articles, they seem to be a nice tool for beginners.

 

When I have time, I might think about writing a couple of articles myself. I've been playing quite a lot since the release of the game, let's not be selfish and go share that accumulated knowledge :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
