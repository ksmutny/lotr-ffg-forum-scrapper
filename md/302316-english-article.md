Here is the English version of what we have found or so far and big things is it shows the other side of that contract and specifically what each of the new doomed cards do. Hype level is all time high for me and my family haha.

Horns is a good idea, I'm almost surprised they haven't been introduced before.  They should have banners also.  (As far as I know there are no banners currently, but I'm only up to Heirs of Numenor).

So with his staff... does it literally mean the "Doomed" card has to say "Doomed X" in order to get the cost reduced?

Or can it say Doomed 3, and it reduce the cost to Doomed 1?

Have one of them wear The One Ring, too -- now THAT would be an aggro deck!

Seriously, though, with a starting threat of 38 and Saruman's reliance on Doomed, you'd basically start in Valor mode, which could be quite interesting.

Also important thing. When a doomed 2 or less card is reduced by the staff, is it still counts as a doomed card played for his readying effect?

Also, something that irks me: On his hero card they type doomed with lower case d, "doomed", while on his staff they type Doomed with the capital D, "Doomed".

It doesn't fit at all and would look at home in the Marvel LCG.

## 24 [Halberto on November 15, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/302316-english-article/?do=findComment&comment=3829649)

Strider do seems one of the best 1 cost attachment to play with the new contract.  

 quest action for free + 2w boost . Basically you are recovering 2 hero quest actions. Great with elrond,  Gandalf, Saruman, aragorn and any big hero with powerful spread stats. 

## 25 [John Constantine on November 15, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/302316-english-article/?do=findComment&comment=3829660)

Also. It's been awhile, and I'm not sure, so please, remind me. During the quest phase, can I exhausted Saruman to quest, play the freshly revealed far sight to scout 5 encounter cards, therefore readying Saruman, and then commit the reset of my characters to quest with newly obtained information? My gut and my fain recollection of the rules tells me I can't.

## 26 [Halberto on November 15, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/302316-english-article/?do=findComment&comment=3829680)

No, all characters commit to quest at the same time. 

In multiplayer, the next players can choose who to commit based on the newly obtained information (unless you strictly stick to the table talk rule,  of course....).

Essentially each player, in turn order, commits his characters to quest at the same time.

Even sticking to the tabletalk rule you can find ways to convey the information. It's better just to have a good sense of teamwork than stick to this godawful rule. Thanks for the answer.

You are welcome.  And to be clear tabletalk rule is so silly in a cooperative game like our beloved lotr lcg to border nonsense. I'm sure that if the developer could travel back in time and erase 1 rule from the original rule sheet it would be this one...

Note that there is no longer an action window between each player committing characters to the quest, so even if player 1 has Saruman, there's no window for them to play Far-sighted after committing but also before player 2 committing.

[For reference, it's RR steps 3.2, action window, 3.3.]

All of a player's characters commit to the quest at once.  There are a few cards that let you withdraw or commit later, but unless all of Saruman's allies are Hobbits with Hobbit Ponies, they can't come in later repeatedly.

I was thinking Keyforge, actually, but I can see a Marvel influence as well. Definitely looks out of place with most of the other cards in the game.

Btw, dat Nori seems like a pretty weak unique ally for 3 with his statline and ability. Am I underestimating his ability?

## 36 [koriakin97 on November 16, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/302316-english-article/?do=findComment&comment=3830264)

Nori might be quite strong with dedicated deck discard, because there aren’t many more cards that recycle deck. So he’s more an enabler for weak but funny deck. And about commuting to the quest: from what I remember you trigger reactions before next player commits characters (makes Theodred weaker and the dwarf that looks at the top of encounter deck can help other players decide who to commit)

## 37 [Amicus Draconis on November 16, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/302316-english-article/?do=findComment&comment=3830296)

Nori helps you recycle your deck for say Thorin Stonehelm without the need for spirit.

And he will be the first card I will use alt art for.

No, I understand what he does. I just don't see the value in it, at least for the reasources he consumes while being an unique ally. Those are usually very powerful for their cost, especially with the latest powercreep and all.

## 39 [sappidus on November 16, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/302316-english-article/?do=findComment&comment=3830315)

I think recursion in card games is always potentially quite powerful (broken?), so I don't mind Nori's cost. Probably you'll need a shuffling effect to make full use of this style of recursion… Tactics Imrahil, perhaps?

## 40 [Wandalf the Gizzard on November 16, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/302316-english-article/?do=findComment&comment=3830324)

To me, Nori is useful as a good one-of in a mining deck to extend its life a little further and maybe pull back some really helpful cards you missed the first time around.

## 41 [John Constantine on November 16, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/302316-english-article/?do=findComment&comment=3830363)

The main problem that I see with him is that he seems to be overpriced by 1 to compensate for his ability, but his ability gives no immediate power, and plus it's pretty conditional, not to mentioning it being relevant for a single archetype. I can see many games being won/lost without the cards he shuffled even showing up, if any.

Well it's actually correctly priced for its statline (6 total for 3 cost)...

I dunno, total or no total, distribution also matters. Convert one of his willpower or defense into attack, and he would be worthwhile, both for attacking and for putting more work into making his ability come true.

Yeah Nori is terrible unfortunately. His art looks like it belongs in a minecraft/cartoon type game, and compared to lotrs normal art it looks ridiculous. And his ability is just not good.

Anyway, I have a question about Saruman. If you trigger the steward of orthanc ally ability and give an event doomed 1 to draw a card, does that also ready Saruman? It would be a shame if it didn't but I am unsure.

I'd say yes because his response doesn't say doomed has to be printed. As oppose to his second paragraph that wonldn't trigger because the doomed keyword has to be printed.

In fact there isn't any reason Grima giving a card doomed or any of the allies that you can give them doomed when you play them from your hand wouldn't ready him either (though in the latter case it's rarer he will be exhausted in the planning phase unless you used word of Command or Peace and Thought). But I love the synergy in this case with Isenguard.

I wonder about that-- does a card that says "give the ally doomed x" count as having the doomed keyword?

 

I wish the doomed reductions/boons wasn't restricted to events. It would be nice to use grima with reckless abandon on allies and attachments.

question regarding the contract: why it is "you cannot chose more than one starting hero"? why doesn't it say "you start with one hero"?

...so, in other words:

a) why the "starting hero"? ... is there a way to get other hero cards into play? Is this a reference to Sword-Thain?

b) what about the quests where you have only one hero in play at the beginning, like that quest where you try to escape the prison???

## 49 [Halberto on November 17, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/302316-english-article/?do=findComment&comment=3830718)

yes It is a refercence to cards allowing you to increase your initial hero number and initial hero limit cap, like sword thain, desperate alliance,  saga heroes, etc... all those cards are still allowed 

 

More difficult to say what would happen in capture quest. For some there is a clear workaround,  at least in multiplayer,  but most probably this contract will not be playable in those, very few, quests.

 

## 50 [John Constantine on November 17, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/302316-english-article/?do=findComment&comment=3830726)

I'm thinking you choose your initial hero and then any other effects could happen. Sagas would force another hero upon you. You don't choose to take control of frodo, bilbo, or aragorn, for example

In those quests the one hero in play at the beginning is your one starting hero. I'm not sure why this is confusing?

If you are playing Escape from Dol Guldur solo, then it's pretty much automatic loss anyway.

I don't know if you technically lose EfDG if the captive hero is the only hero you have... but practically speaking yes, since even if it's not an automatic loss you wouldn't be able to play any cards.

Technically you'd be able to play 0-cost neutral cards like Hope Rekindled… but I think the implication in the FAQ [http://www.lotr-lcg-quest-companion.gamersdungeon.net/#Card125] is that it is an immediate loss before you ever get there anyway.

Well, you could always play Thalin [https://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/13258/amono-thalindeckthatcanbeataquest-1.0], and win anyway 😁

Also don't forget some cards become heroes like Prince Imrahil, Thalion, and anyone you Sword-Thain.

Not sure if anyone still believes the "upcoming" page anymore, but for what it's worth, this pack has been moved up from it's original us release month of March to February. The update was this week... If they can stick with that, that would be excellent.

So it might come out after the UK gets Wrath and Ruin (if the UK ever gets Wrath and Ruin)

Once again, we have a pretty exciting update... a release date for 2/7 for the states has been announced and the pack is now shipping in the USA.

if anyone gets their hands on it early and wants to spoil the last couple cards, bless you.

The last two cards have been spoiled for this pack on hall of beorn. And they are doozies.

Pre-orders look like they were sent out January 30th and the USPS delivered it to my mailbox on February 1st. I was shocked how quickly it got to me in Reno, NV. Their estimate on Informed Delivery said February 4th, I believe.

## 65 [silverthorn on February 5, 2020](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/302316-english-article/?do=findComment&comment=3887046)

It's due for release in the UK on Friday
