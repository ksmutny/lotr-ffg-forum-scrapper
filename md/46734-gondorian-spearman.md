I would like to know if I have this guy's usefulness down right. We've been using him to defend against an enemy with HP-1 to effectively kill it for free. This is because my understanding is, that he deals his one damage immediately upon being declared a defender. Since that substep is before the Shadow resolution and damage determination, it destroys the enemy without killing the Spearman. Is that correct?

Yes, he deals the 1 damage right away.

In a combo with Swift Strike, he can kill up to 3 hp enemies for free. I think that is pretty good.

 I like him with Thalin too. You can kill right away any enemy with 2 HP or less.

Yup, or you can use several Spearmen with Stand Together! It's ideal to kill off enemies with a high defense.

Yes is like this. But have also another options. The card text says :when G. Sp. declare as a defender deal 1 damage to attacking enemy. BUT all enemies is attacking. Is mean he can deal the damage  not only the enemy who is fight with him also any other enemies engaged with players. Maybe even with another player in multy-player game. This very interesting aspect.You can deal damage to enemy who is still waiting for resolve or another who is already resolve the attack.Give you more opportunity prevent some shadow effect and so on.

I don't think it works like that.  I don't think an "engaged" enemy is considered an "attacking" enemy until it is selected during Step 1 of Resolving enemy attacks, and you resolve the attacks of each enemy individually.  That way only one enemy is "attacking" at a time, so the Gondorian Spearman only has one enemy to choose from at the time his ability is triggered.

Yes you right. I just check the rulebook now.

We had an interesting situation the other day, having an enemy attacking we declared Gondorian Spearman as a defender to deal one damage and played Quick Strike after that to kill it with Legolas (the one point of damage was required to do so) before it had its chance to strike. I think it was played by the rules although it seemed kinda strange.

Actions can be played at any time and should resolve before any new steps / phases kick in.

Sounds legal to me.

 Actions can be played between steps in combat, so you just use the action after step 2 or 3 of enemy attacks, before step 4 when the attack is actually resolved. Preferably before step 3 to avoid the shadow card.
