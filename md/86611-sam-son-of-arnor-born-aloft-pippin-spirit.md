# [Sam + Son of Arnor + Born Aloft + Pippin (spirit)](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86611-sam-son-of-arnor-born-aloft-pippin-spirit/)

this is more of an idea than a combo. at the moment there is too many drawbacks, threat increase being one of them, limited recycleability being another, and its costly

 

the idea is to get 3 son of arnors in play to engage high threat enemies, sam gets +3 of all stats, pippin sends them straight back. born aloft are put on the sons to bring them back

 

the deck would need all hobbits for pip's ability. and a tactics hobbit, so that means

 

spirit pippin / sam / merry

 

it is a shame that pip's ability needs all hobbits as it would be good to get hama to recycle the born alofts...

 

of course the big weakness here is that pippin would need to send them all back to get the son of arnor next turn to engage them, so thats 9 willpower!!

 

obviously too much, but if you had a galadrims handy, then it would be worth it for the extra stats

 

any other sphere than leadership and it would be too expensive to play a son of arnor every turn, but with steward of gondor perhaps not.

 

of course it doesnt have to be all 3 sons, toned down this could be a nice combo if you can set it up, and theres probably some hobbit cards spoiled that would compliment it nicely

Interesting. I did not think that Sam would get a separate bonus for each time an enemy is engaged, but that is certainly how it reads.

ive just realised how epic fast hitch would be on sam once this combo gets going. 6 willpower, 4 attack, 4 defense and 3 ready abilities....he would be like a 1 hobbit army!

Definitely! But it says on his card, "ready Sam..."  This doesn't mean that he has to be exhausted, right?

thats interesting....does the +1s depend on you readying him or not?

No. There is a full stop. It is two effects. Even if the first sentence fizzels the second will not. This is a pumpable effect. Maybe less threat problem would be to use something like this...

yeah.. also remember they never broke to infinite loop took combo... so threat mean nothing any more anyway. I do not run this combo, but you can reduce you threat with impunity if you really want to.

And how about the amazingly simple yet powerful Sam + The Hammer Stroke combo! Of course, it would all depend on if they had a higher engagement cost then you... But still. I think this would work.

Sounds like a cool combo! Pair Sam with Merry and maybe Boromir(tactics)/Beregond...use Beregond/Boromir with behind strong walls (or Boromir's ability) to defend the enemies, attack with Sam and Merry, Merry readies Sam to attack again. Or include Cram to ready Merry to start their chain over. If using Boromir pay the threat to use his attack too. Could be a 3 person wrecking crew
