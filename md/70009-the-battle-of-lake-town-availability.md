Does any one know where and when the battle of lake town will be available to the non-gencon population?

The last PoD came out about mid-September (about a month after GenCon). So maybe a few weeks from now?

Polish publisher of LOTR:LCG announced that Battle at Lake Town will be available in November 2012. I think FGG's Englisg version should be available around the same time or a bit earlier.
