So when the "next player" phrase comes up on nasty cards i understand the faq says because there isnt a next player in a solo game the effect doesnt happen

But...

I am also hoping this type of thing doesnt apply to "choose player" as there are many valuable abilities that ask you to play them on a chosen player, i assume you can choose yourself in a solo game yes? Otherwise a huge chunk of my card collection would be useless for solo play.

Yes, you can choose yourself.
