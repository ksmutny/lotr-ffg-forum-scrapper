Hi,

 

Can the cave torch be used on location cards in the staging area? My LOTR instincts tell me no, but I would like a wise sage to confirm if possible.

 

Kind regards.

Yes, this is possible. A location is any location.

Of course, the location has to be Dark.

Thanks very much.

 

Initially I thought I could (reading the card literally). Then when I thought about it realistically I would not actually be at a location in the staging area, I concluded that I could not.

 

But thanks for putting me straight on this one. It will make it a lot easier.

If the Cave Torch essentially lets you "explore locations faster," maybe when one is in the staging area you can imagine yourself peering down a corridor, using the torch to see better and decide whether or not you need to go that way at all.
