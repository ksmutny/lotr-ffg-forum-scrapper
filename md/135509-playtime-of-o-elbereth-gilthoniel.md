Hi community,

 

after a look at this card: O Elbereth! Gilthoniel! (O Elbereth! Gilthoniel!) [http://deckbauer.telfador.net/card.html&id=695]

 

Response: After a non-unique enemy attacks you, put that enemy on the bottom of the encounter deck. If your threat is lower than that enemy's engagement cost, set your threat equal to the engagement cost of that enemy.

 

When do the response trigger during an enemy attack? 

- after declaring the attacking enemy?

- after declaring the defender?

- after resolving the schadoweffects?

- after determining combat damage?

 

I think .. after attacks you describes the whole attack including all steps from declaring the attacking enemy to determining combat damage. So i can play it after the attack is completely resolved .. not a step before.. right?

I'm 99% sure it's after dealing combat damage and the attack is completely resolved.  Otherwise that's the worst wording ever.

I concur (supported by FAQ, p. 8):

Q: When do “after this enemy attacks” Forced effects like those on Chieftan Ufthak (CORE 90) and Wargs (CORE 85) resolve?
A: These effects resolve immediately after step 4 of enemy attack resolution. (emphasis mine)

I still haven't used this card even once and now after i saw this i'm definietly never using this card. I haven't even figured out that what does that card even really do, i mean that how it will make an enemy to go bottom of the encounter deck?

What do you mean?  The enemy fled.

O Elbereth is great. Before the errata I used it to solo Conflict at the Carrock on nightmare with a lore/spirit deck. 3 trolls to the bottom of the deck one at a time, lower my threat to avoid engaging the trolls I dont want to between each and having enough allies to deal with the final 2 trolls damage-wise. Did it in my 2nd attempt as opposed to 10+ attempts with my dual partner :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

I meant that what makes that enemy to flee because i googled that O Elbereth thingy and according wiki, it says that it's somekind of  elvish song/hymn.  Also how any song or hymn could make any enemy to flee. Is it so terrible listen to that enemies run away after hearing it?

In the story, Frodo, the other hobbits and Aragorn are attacked by the Nazgul in the wildnerness.  Aragorn fights back, which the Nazgul were not expecting, and they flee.  At the same time, Frodo goes into a kind of trance almost, and shouts out part of that song.  The card is meant to represent that moment, although I do not know if the Elvish words themselves are supposed to have made the Nazgul flee (I don't think so, they were just surprised to encounter strong resistance).

That's pretty good explanation. Thanks  ^_^ [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_happy.png]

Elbereth aka Varda is the Queen of the Valar, most loved and revered by the elves and most feared by Morgoth. As the Nazgul are servants of Sauron who was himself a servant of Morgoth, they fear her considerably more, so it's not out of the question for them to flee, at least temporarily, from a cry of her name. Aragorn also says after the attack that the name of Elbereth was more deadly to the Witch-King than Frodo's attempt to stab him.

I think it also illustrates that the enemy is somewhat relying on the decline that has left the world somewhat ignorant of its own history. Sure, it was probably Aragorn standing up to them and not cowering that weakened their resolve, but also hearing someone knowing a name of such power probably threw them for a loop. It is also worth noting that while the Nazgul are utter badasses, I've always imagined they fell due to lack of willpower and inner strength.

There is also a moment in the Shire when Frodo spots a Ringwraith crawling towards him. However, just at that moment, a group of Elves comes along singing a song to Elbereth (including the line the card is named after), which causes the Ringwraith to flee.

That is the moment Frodo and Sam encounter Gildor Inglorion's party
