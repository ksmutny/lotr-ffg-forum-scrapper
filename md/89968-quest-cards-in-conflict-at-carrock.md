I only seem to have two quest cards for this mission.

Is that correct?

Heh, I don't think anyone ever got that right :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] everyone I know of have asked this question including me. "Man! I'm missing a card. Hm, but the quest looks like it's okay. But that can't be?!? Just two cards? Better hear with my friends in the forum" ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] It's almost one of those things that FFG should consider to include in their next FAQ :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] lol

Ps. Phil43 Just to be sure but this isn't in anyway sarcastic or in other ways meant to down you. I just read it and felt like rambling a little :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] Funny to see just how many times this will pop up again now that the first cycle is in sale/comes into sale again.

Happy gaming :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
