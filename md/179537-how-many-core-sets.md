I have been playing this game for over a year now and have enjoyed it very much.  The thing I don't know is how many core sets I should own. I play with my brothers, so one wont suffice and I got a second one.  I now have the opportunity to get a third.  It would just be so much easier to play with six sneak attacks, three unexpected courages and such.

how many do ya'll recommend?

One per player.  Sleeves and proxies ftw.

1 per player,  1 core decks.    Keep the game challenging.

You can get by with one per two players.  One per player if you are getting serious about it.  Otherwise every deck will have sneak attack Gandalfs and Tests of Will and it gets boring.

3 if you dont want to proxy and want 3 of some of the really good and important cards - unexpected courage and a couple of other staples.

I asked my wallet, it says a single core set is enough per two players. My wife agrees with my wallet.

I don't always trust wallets. They can be silly sometimes.

This is not the kind of challenge you want. But if you do, you can restrict yourself even while having infinite copies of sneak attacks.

Yeah, but it's a lot harder to restrict yourself when those extra copies are sitting right in front of you.

thx all.  Yah, my main q is whether with three of us, its worth it to get a third.  now my wallet also has a lot to say in this matter.  I only have through dwarrowdelf cycles wise so I'm really wondering whether its worth it to get third set or whether I should just get new ones.

After half a year, I bough number 2, now I want to buy number 3.

Typically play solo 2 Players. Hobbits (Sam, Peppin, Merrin & Frodo, Aragorn (£) and Glorfindel (*))

So I need a first turn Sneak Gandalf in one of both decks to get through Into Ithilien, Heirs of Númenor.

Ok, I managed the Quest with a different deck, but want to pass it with my favorite combo twin deck.

I think 2 core sets is enough.
