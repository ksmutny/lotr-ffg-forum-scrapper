# [FYI: Test of Will immune to Map of Earnil - Official ruling](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/95248-fyi-test-of-will-immune-to-map-of-earnil-official-ruling/)

Although the wording on the cards are clear enough, I wanted to get clarification anyway. 

 

Map of Earnil (and its sister cards in other spheres) cannot be used to fish out response type events from your discard pile.  From Caleb himself:

 

"Because the effect on the Map of Earnil is an Action, there is no window to trigger it when resolving the "when revealed" effects of an encounter card. Since Response effects all respond to some kind of trigger, and Actions cannot interrupt those effects, it is impossible to use the Map or Earnil (and other similar cards) to play a Response from your discard pile.

Cheers,

Caleb"

A lot of things seem obvious in this game, but when you consider the amount of errata and FAQ, it's not always so cut and dried.  I wanted to make sure it was CLARIFIED.  Besides, I know I've been guilty of making incorrect assumptions before - even subconsciously and I've read plenty of posts here where others have done the same.  Nothing wrong with additional information.

Better one clarification too much than one missing.

Good to know. This question has been coming up all over the place so it's good that Caleb has made an official ruling on it. I expect this to be in the next FAQ. Next they need to get busy clarifying all the rules issues brought up from Morgul Vale.
