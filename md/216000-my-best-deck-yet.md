> No Power in the Earth?

 

No power in the 'verse favors that card. Not even on April Fool's.

I'm surprised that The End Comes did not make the list. It has amazing synergy with Dori, Song of Mocking, and Fall of Gil whatever. I would at least consider it for the sideboard against certain quests like the Dread Realm where it can save you from several weak enemies.

1 x Keeping Count is a top strategy! I'm a bit concerned by Arod, he sometimes conflicts with my decks. I'd recommend cutting him to make room for the powerful Good Harvest/Beorn's Hospitality combo.

Haha yeah I totally should've put in A Good Harvest / Gandaf's Search to help you find that 1 copy of Keeping Count.
