I would like everyone to be aware of the locations for the Fellowship Events so that they don't miss out! It's a great opportunity to meet other players and play an epic game of LotR.

I've compiled a map of known 2017 Fellowship Events as well as a list of places that have held Fellowship Event in previous years that might be worth checking out. If you know of a location that is hosting an event and is not on the map, feel free to add it yourself! It is helpful if you can add the appropriate date, time, and a link to a page with more information, if possible.

I add 4 events, all in France. I was unable to put them in the categories you have already created. I have found all the information (in french) here: http://sdajce.forumactif.org/f144-fellowship-2017-2018 [http://sdajce.forumactif.org/f144-fellowship-2017-2018]

Wow that's a lot of work, thanks for compiling!

I added the Spanish event to the map.

Sadly, FFG organized play in our country (Spain) is an absolutely mess, and we can not rely on them to create events. Luckily, we have a quite proactive community of players who organizes a meeting once a year to play our lovely game with the help of a local store that ask for the kits in english so we can play them. This year we had 30 people playing LOTR LCG.

I would love to participate in one if anyone knows of one going on in Michigan. The store on the map posted in the OP for Grand Rapids, MI (GrandLAN) has been closed for a while now, so that is out of date.

Thanks for this. However, I would have expected Fantasy Flight to have a list of participating stores?

I'm in London, UK and I'd like to know all the participating stores near me.

Found a location in the Netherlands that hosts this 2017 Fellowship event, on Monday December 11 from 19:00 till 23:00

Added it to the map though I'm not sure how to add it to the December 11 layer.
