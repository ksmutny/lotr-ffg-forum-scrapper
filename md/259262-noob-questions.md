Yes. I am so noob. 

Can I add progress tokens to locations revealed from the encounter deck during the same phase?

I am not sure how after commit to a quest actually works.

My guess:

1. Commit characters. 

2. Resolve after commit effects in the order is wish. 

3. Reveal the encounter cards. 

4. Sum, compare and all that.

 

But I also see the point 2 as the 4 possible. 

EDIT: title changed to focus my beginning doubts.

Turn Sequence, pg. 30

3. Quest Phase

A. Commit characters to a quest.

B. Reveal encounter cards.

B.1. Action window

C. Resolve questing.

C.1 Action window.

 

The way the Quest Phase is structured, you may use the action on Northern Tracker in the 3.B.1. Action window once all encounter cards have been revealed to add progress to all locations in the staging area, even ones that came out this turn. You would not have had the same effect if you done it in step 3.A.

Actually, Northern Tracker doesn't have an action. It's a response, which limits it to 3.A

If it were an action, then your analysis would be correct.

@ovinomanc3r [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/258337-ovinomanc3r/], Actions can be used in any action window (in the back of the rulebook - any of the green phases). Responses can only be used when their trigger is met - which can be in any phase, red or green. In the case of Northern tracker, the trigger is "When you commit Northern Tracker to the quest."

So, you commit it to a quest, add a progress token to every location in the staging area, and then reveal cards, just like you said.

Oh darn. I haven't played with it in so long I've forgotten what it does.

Actually it says AFTER but not a big deal. The trigger would go after A so before B.

Thanks.

Another one:

Characters committed to a quest are considered committed to that quest through the end of the quest phase, unless removed from the quest by a card effect. They do remain exhausted once this step is complete

 

From this I am not sure if Aragorn sum against the threat when committing to a quest even if I ready him with his skill.

And if a character dies through the progress (by an effect from the encounter deck)? That character sums to the total?

Characters can ready and still be committed to the quest. If Aragorn uses his ability,  you still count his willpower.

If a character dies in the middle of questing,  then you lose their willpower

## 9 [ovinomanc3r on September 27, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/259262-noob-questions/?do=findComment&comment=2999927)

Is the effect of being killed immediate?

There is an action step after each step of the combat phase. I reveal the shadow effect which deals 1 damage to every character. One of those character would die but I can heal her with an action effect. However I don't know if that damage is checked during the last step of the combat phase or inmediately.

## 10 [dalestephenson on September 27, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/259262-noob-questions/?do=findComment&comment=2999935)

There's an action window between revealing the shadow and resolving the damage from the attack, so (for example) if the shadow increased the attack you could heal the defender before the damage from the attack is resolved.  But if the shadow deals direct damage (like this case), there is no action window prior to applying that damage.  The only way to save your character would be with a shadow-cancelling response.

## 11 [ovinomanc3r on September 27, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/259262-noob-questions/?do=findComment&comment=2999990)

Thanks!

 

Another one:

Does the game end inmediately when you accomplish the last quest card requirements?

I understood that yes but scoring I was not sure if the last round should be counted or not as I ended during the mission phase.

Not a big deal but I like to use the scoring system to check the performance of the deck. 

## 12 [dalestephenson on September 27, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/259262-noob-questions/?do=findComment&comment=3000012)

The game is ended immediately.  I would think you would count the final round since you played part of it, but I will defer to people who actually use the scoring system.  I consider the scoring system entirely pointless and useless.

## 13 [Onidsen on September 27, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/259262-noob-questions/?do=findComment&comment=3000102)

I don't use the scoring system much,  but I think that it only counts rounds you completed.

## 14 [Rouxxor on September 27, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/259262-noob-questions/?do=findComment&comment=3000295)

It only count rounds completed. I use to count points years ago, but it is not very efficient to compare deck efficiency.

I just noticed it. Only three games so not too much to compare but 1st 67, 2nd 159, 3rd 102.

Same deck, same quest, not many problems during any game, just more or less time to draw some cards. It seemed a big difference for just some lucky draws.

Well done! 
The stage 2 of the quest was a nightmare for me , when I finally won it was amazing! I know how you feel

## 18 [Rouxxor on October 22, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/259262-noob-questions/?do=findComment&comment=3038564)

The good path to win this one is to stay as long as needed on stage one and pass the stage two on only one turn. Otherwise there is to many cards revealed and to many enemies engaged against you on the same time.

The best is to be able to keep a threat under 30 when you pass on stage 3. If you do so it is pretty hard to loose :).

## 19 [ovinomanc3r on October 22, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/259262-noob-questions/?do=findComment&comment=3038990)

One quick question:

Can I use Steward of Gondor to play cards during the same planning phase I played Steward of Gondor?

At the beginning I did it that way (caming from MTG it was normal). Then I realizad player actions came after playing cards but I saw in a video someone who used the steward to play more cards during the same phase.

Is it

1. Play cards

2. Play actions 

(As I understood)

Or 

1. Play cards and actions in any order. 

?

The entire planning phase allows actions, so you may play cards and actions in any order.

## 21 [Rouxxor on October 22, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/259262-noob-questions/?do=findComment&comment=3039023)

During organization everyone can play action at any time (except at the middle of the resolution of a card obviously). So even between allies and attachment of a partner.

You're not the only one to have had this doubt. In the last pages of the Core Set Rulebook you can see that  in the turn sequence of the planning phase players are free to take actions ( pag.30). In multiplayer the only limitation is that the active player is the only one who can play allies or attachments, once has passed the player on the left becomes the active player and it is now too late for the previous active player to play allies or attachments, but action windows are still open for all.

Escape from Do Guldur won during my first attempt. It was hard. We had to deal with two spider web and we lost Gimly and Theodred at the end moving to the third stage at 49 both players but with the Nazgul dead. Galadrim and a lucky Gandalf to turbo-quest and over saturate the stage even with an active location. Iluvatar blessed Faramir and Celebrian-Eowyn. Woohoo! 

MVP: Gimly who took the key since the beginning to boost himself and send the Nazgul back to where it belongs with the help of Gandalf.

I love finishes with the threat level so high! Always tense and exciting! Makes me want to bust out Gimli again and carve some orcs.

I just steped in Khazad Dum! Not tried yet. I skiped all the mirkwood cicle cause they are reprinting them and are hard to get around me so I preferred to move directly to the beloved and dusty caverns. 

I suppose I am missing things from the previous cicle but I wanted to be sure if I could have problems. Under a first glance it seems not to me, actually I am excited about all the drawf synergy (Gimly and Thalin are going to enjoy reminding old times with their little friends).

Khazad dum should be just fine without the shadows of mirkwood expansions. Heirs of numenor isn't one I'd jump into right after the core set, but Khazad dum should be fine

When an effect instruct me to discard something, let's say a character, heroes counts? 

I mean I know they count as characters but I suffer an effect that instructed me to choose and discard one character committed to the quest if possible. I only had my lovely Thalin and I discarded him. It was so painful to loose him falling in a dark hole just after entering Moria... I would like to know I am not making this harder than already is.

Nope - you're right. If an effect references characters, that includes both allies and heroes.

That's a nasty effect, by the way. The best way to deal with it is probably to have a cheap ally always questing with you. (Ideally, something with 0 WP, like Snowbourne Scout.) That way you can just get rid of the otherwise unimportant ally instead of losing a hero.

Sometimes you can't do that, unfortunately. Later on in the life of the game, you'll get to some cards that let you start pulling cards out of the encounter deck and adding them to the victory display, and that's a pretty good way to deal with those nasty un-cancellable treacheries.

Lol I had that scout just ready next to Thalin. I didn't commit him cause he was useless.

Now I cannot remove the image of the snowbourne scout pushing Thalin through the hole.

It would be more likely

Thalin: "Hurry up fellows!"

Scout: "No, we haven't checked for trap in this area!"

Thalin: "Nonsense! In dwarve mine there is no trap. Let's go"

Scout: "I recommend you not to do this"

Thalin, start to run: "FOR THE MO..AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!"

Scout: "I told you so"

Lol. 

Tried again today and you know what? The very first Thalin did was jump through the first hole he saw during the first quest phase. 

Fortunately we made our way to the seventh level and found him waiting for the rest of the party to continue our adventure. 

 

Btw if a shadow card discard a defender the attack is considered undefended? It sounds contradictory to me.

Another one: when a shadow effect cancel the damage dealt to the enemy does it cancel the gondor spearman damage or also the damage dealt by my attack. I understand that shadows card remains until the end of the page to possible effect that boosted defense but in this case it cancel or the damage dealt during the combat phase?

## 35 [dalestephenson on November 1, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/259262-noob-questions/?do=findComment&comment=3058953)

If a shadow card discards the defender it does result in an undefended attack.  Nasty.

I believe the shadow that says "Cancel all combat damage dealt to attack enemy" will apply only to your attack to that enemy -- damage from Gondorian Spearman is not combat damage.  "Determine combat damage" is a specific step in combat resolution, step 4 in enemy attacks on players and step 3 in player attacks on enemies.

## 36 [Onidsen on November 1, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/259262-noob-questions/?do=findComment&comment=3059077)

Basically, it goes like this:

You resolve the effects of the shadow card in full before you actually resolve the attack against the defender. If the shadow card (or anything else!) results in an effect that would remove the defender somehow (discard defending character, deal 1 point of damage when the defender only has 1 HP left, and so on), then when you get to the actual attack resolution, you don't have a defending character anymore.

And whenever an attack happens without a defending character, the attack must be undefended.

## 37 [ovinomanc3r on November 3, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/259262-noob-questions/?do=findComment&comment=3062686)

It is possible to attack, exhaust, ready and attack again with the same character? 

As long as to ready a character doesn't remove her from questing I was wondering if the same is true while attacking.

Yes, but the character who is readying to attack a second time (e.g., via Unexpected Courage) cannot attack the same enemy twice in the same phase (i.e., the character would need to attack a different enemy during the second attack). I believe the exception to that rule is if an event like Quick Strike is played to trigger one of the attacks (don't have time to check the rulebook/FAQ... I'm sure someone else will correct me if I'm wrong).

But a normal attack and an attack triggered by Quick Strike against the same foe would still need to be resolved separately.

  

## 39 [ovinomanc3r on November 3, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/259262-noob-questions/?do=findComment&comment=3062988)

How stand together really works? 

Stand-Together.jpg [https://s3.amazonaws.com/hallofbeorn-resources/Images/Cards/Core-Set/Stand-Together.jpg]

As I understand it simply means during combat phase I may declare aditional defenders against engaged enemies instead of the limit of 1 as long as they could defend normally. 

So exhausted characters cannot defend playing this card. 

Also each character only can defend against 1 enemy not against each enemy. The wording is quite confusing to me.

Am I right?

Also:

How shadows card that affect the defender works?

How the damage is dealt?

Does defense stats stack?

## 40 [GrandSpleen on November 3, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/259262-noob-questions/?do=findComment&comment=3063021)

It sounds like you've understood Stand Together correctly.  You can use it, then for the remainder of that combat phase, you can defenders basically in the same way you declare attackers.  Multiple defenders can stack up against one attack.  They still have to be ready, and they can still only defend once (unless you can ready them someone), same as performing an attack.   And there is a clarification about it in the FAQ:

"(1.04) Damage and Multiple Defenders If a player uses card effects to declare multiple defenders against a single enemy attack, the defending player must assign all damage from that attack to a single defending character"

As for shadow cards, if a shadow card says "Defending character gets -1 defense," I think I would apply that to 1 character only, not all of the characters.  Same if the card says "Deal 1 damage to the defending character."  My reasoning is that it says "character" and not "characters," but I don't have anything official to back that up.

When you determine combat damage, you will tally together all of the defenders' defense stats, then apply any damage exceeding that tally to a single defending character.

And if you like cards that let you declare multiple defenders, here is a newer card that might interest you:
