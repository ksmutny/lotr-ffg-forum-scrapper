Hi all, a simple question. I know that print on demand cards may have slightly different back colours, so......

What type of sleeves are okay for tournement play?

Obviously the backs need to be opaque, so....

Single colour backs okay for the different decks, clear for quests.

The reason I ask is that my local store doesn't have enough art backs for me to do the base box set.

Hopefully an answer will come before I pop out to the store.

All the best.

Richard

Single colour are fine.Â
