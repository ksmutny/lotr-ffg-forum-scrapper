If an encounter card with surge (and/or doomed) is added to the staging area, does the surge/doomed keyword resolve?

Nope.

Like @GrandSpleen [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/177891-grandspleen/] says no. It only does when the card is revealed (regardless how or where it is revealed from by the way).

Another side note: a player card with doomed keyword placed in play (Like a Sarouman with Vilya) do it doomed keyword.
