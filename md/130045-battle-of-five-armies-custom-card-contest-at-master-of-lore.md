Hey guys, I'm running my first contest over on my blog Master of Lore [http://masteroflore.wordpress.com/]. Create a cool custom card based on Peter Jackson's last Hobbit film (silly or serious) and I'll send you your choice of an event card from core set if I post it with my film review. Follow the link [http://masteroflore.wordpress.com/2014/12/28/contest-the-battle-of-the-five-armies-custom-cards/] to check out the details. Have fun!
