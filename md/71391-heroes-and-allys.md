 I got a question: now there are ally and hero cardswith the same name and unique logo. You can never play a unique card when there is already in play among you or he other players, but when you play a unique ally and there is a hero with the same name in play? Its not the same card but only the same name. So the question is: can i play a same named ally card when there is a hero with the same name in play?

 rulebook page 8:

 



If any player has a unique card in play, no player can play or put into play another card with the same title.

And it is also said in the rulebook from the hobbit (for Beorn for example)
