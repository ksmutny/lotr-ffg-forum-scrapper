If I have 3 copies of expert treasure hunter to response, do I turn my top card of the deck face up in between each of the 3 responses?

I would say yes. The top card is always faceup, as soon as the previous one leaves top of the deck - the next one turns faceup.

I think: yes, as passive effects are "always on" and happen faster than any other type of effect.

 

Note that, by errata, Expert Treasure Hunter is now max one per hero.

Yes that's the way to play it. Crazy card draw if attached to 3 questing heroes.

Gandalf with expert treasure hunter, his pipe & hidden cache gets you 2 extra resources every turn.

Crazy combo. Way powerful. Broken? No. Just awsome.

How does the Cache give resources every turn? Isn't it discarded?

Indeed it is, and it's even part of the trick.

Combo goes as follows:

Quest & guess attatchment. Yay for Gandalf, you can see your top card.

Then by expert treasure hunter you get to discard it. There's your 2 resources.

Then by expert treasure hunter you get to take it into your hand.

Lastly, with gandalf's pipe you get to put it back on top of your deck.

Rinse & repeat!

Wow, that's cool.  It's been so long since I read Expert Treasure-Hunter closely that I totally forgot the card gets discarded at first, whether you guess correctly or not.  Neat little combo.

Yeah, i guess i have to go back and re-read all my cards to see what else I'm missing.

That's crazy, but takes a little set still.

You can use word of command to fish out a missing piece from your deck :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Just remember that the wizard pipe (not Gandalf´s pipe btw) is an action to use so cannot do it in between the responses of the expert treasure hunter.

Must wait until next round after card-draw.

Just do the action before resolving the quest.

Also, it was possible with Gildor before. Now you can combine both for +4 ressource per turn.

It is locking your draw ability and your pipe cannot be use for other things (like gildor), so I was never very fond of that combo, but use it once when you absolutly need ressource is fine.

Just pop Radagast in your deck and you´ll be fine for some hot dual-pipe-action.

A wizards´ duel between Gandalf and Radagast sure to go down in the books as the most epic moment in the history of middle-earth ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

Wait a minute, am I reading this correctly that each copy of ETH (on different questing hero of course) can trigger on 3 different cards in the same phase?

Wouldn't all of your heroes quest at the same time, and thus all instantaneously discard the same card on top of the deck (rather than 3 separate).

I thought "that" was borderline OP with Gandalf. If you can do it ×3, that is just about downright broken.

Any official rulings on this?

Ohh...and if you guys are wondering why I res'd this thread, just started playing a Gandalf deck for first time.

If the same trigger (in this case, questing successfully) would trigger several Responses (in this case, multiple copies of Expert Treasure Hunter) then you resolve them one at a time in whatever order you choose. So two Expert Treasure Hunters give you two separate attempts.

## 17 [GrandSpleen on July 25, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/127658-expert-treasure-hunter-and-gandalf-trd/?do=findComment&comment=2325385)

No need to go and dig up a developer comment.  This one is cut and dry.  If you have Theodred and Aragorn (Leadership) commit to a quest, they do so simultaneously but you resolve their Responses one at a time, in the order of your choosing.  If you have multiple 3 Lorien Guides or 3 Northern Trackers commit to a quest, you trigger their Responses one at a time (potentially triggering a negative Forced effect like this one [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Market-Square-MatPP]multiple times).  Two Blade of Gondolins on a character, you destroy an enemy and then resolve the Responses one at a time.

 

3 Expert Treasure Hunters on 3 different questing characters, they all quest successfully simultaneously and then you'll resolve those ETHs one at a time, from start to finish, in the order of your choosing.  So that's 3 separate cards. Yes, this combo with Gandalf is pretty ridiculous.

Yeah....I've been playing that way with my Gandalf deck since learning about this. It's so OP, that I took all other card draw out of the deck; as nothing else is necessary.

I kind of wish there was a ruling where Gandalf didn't automatically reveal the second and third card....so atleast the insane card draw could have a shot at failing.

But remember that Expert Treasure Hunter has to go on a questing hero, not just a questing character.  If you have a Three Rings Deck (Gandalf/Elrond/Galadriel), the free card draw is maxed at two, since Galadriel can't quest.

The Rings of Power deck can make easy use of Sword-thain, which you should, and can therefore use all 3 expert treasure hunters.  Glorfindel is the best option available.    Also, if u put Unexpected Courage on Galadriel then you can get 4 cards per turn.  Use Gandalf's Staff for drawn and make it 5 cards per turn.

I had Galadriel's Mirror, Silver Harp, and ally Galdor.  It was rare that I'd use Gandalf's Staff for draw.

 

Glorfindel ally is awesome with massive card draw, and even better with sword-thain and Silver Harp, but in a vacuum I wonder which unique ally would be the most popular if converted directly to a hero.  I think by sphere it would be Gimli (9), Gleowine (3), Arwen (5), and Legolas (8).

What are those numbers a reference too?  Nevermind, I see it know.  You are doing stat counts.
