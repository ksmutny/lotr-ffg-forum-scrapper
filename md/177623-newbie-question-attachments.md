Hi Guys,

Still learning the ropes for LOTR LCG, so I wanted some clarification from some veterans.

1. Can you play attachments on different spheres? For example, a Lore attachment is paid for by a Lore Hero, can you then place that attachment on a tactics ally or does it have to be on a Lore only character?

2. Can attachments be played on any player's characters?

3. Do unique attachments follow the same rules as unique characters?

4. Can you attach the same attachment multiple times on the same character?

5. Is there a limit on the number of attachments you can have on one character?

Thanks again for the help sorry for the barage of questions, just want to play the game right.

Yes to the first 3 questions.

#4 is yes, but a character is only allowed 2 restricted attachments.

5. There is no limit to the number of attachments a character can have. I've had over 20 on one character before!

In regards to Question 1. Some attachments are trait specific, like burning brand which must be attached to hero with lore resource icon. But the majority are not sphere specific, however some attachments are trait specific, but that's all printed on the card and easy to figure out.

1. Yes

2. Yes (keep in mind some attachments say specifically what type of character they can be attached to.  Some attachments can only be attached to heroes, for example).

3. Yes

4. Yes, provided it is not unique or has the text "limit one per character". Additionally, each character may only attach two restricted attachments.

5. No, there is no limit.  Just make sure you do not attach more than 2 restricted attachments and ensure you don't attach more than one attachment that has a "limit one per character" to a single character.

The first question can´t be answered with yes or no lol.

 

Yes, you can play attachments (unless stated otherwise) on characters from different spheres, like Blade of Gondolin on Aragorn Leadership. So you could play an Lore attachment on a Tactics ally.

Hah! I believe we were both replying to his first question in question 1.  I overlooked the second question.  Thanks for clarifying for him and anyone else reading.

"Sorry for the newbie stuff" Man, don't be sorry! We all wonder about this games' rules and have made plenty of mistakes. I myself am sure that I overlook stuff all the time or do something wrong. Nonetheless, mistakes let you learn and I have made aplenty so that I can now help others and improve my own game. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] So, no need to be apologizing. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

Just to note:  there ARE some attachments that require the target character be of a certain sphere.  Sometimes this can be mitigated by Songs.  The easiest example is if you want to play a Burning Brand on Boromir you need to get a Song of Wisdom on him.  After the Burning Brand is attached, if the Song falls off for some reason, the Burning Brand does not.

Another newbie reminder, you asked specifically if an attachment can be played on an ally. The attachment will specify if it can be played on a hero or a character. Character refers to both hero and ally. You probably already figured that out, but I just like to be thourough.
