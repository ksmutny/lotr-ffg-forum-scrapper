As we might se a new preview of Heir of Númenor tonight, I was going to mention this before it gets too obvious. There is a preview of Defender of Rammas on Heirs of Númenor subsite, and I think it is a really powerful card. A Tactics ally of cost 2, 0 willpower, 1 attack, 4 defence and 1 hp. Put aside the most nasty shadow that deal damage, remove a defender or lose you a game, this ally can survive a majority of enemies in majority of quests, and in every major Tactics deck you should have him out on round 1 if you draw him. That seems very strong to me. Also compared to Winged Guardian, this guy seems generally a much better fit.

If you link him with the cards that will upgrade its attack and defense stats or ready him it become just a must have in a tactics deck.

Unless you're trying to take advantage of Eagle synergies, this guy is strictly better than Winged Guardian (which is quite impressive, since the latter is a darn good card). Between the Defender and Beregond, Gondor decks are going to be very resilient.

Exactly. Eagles are great but Gondor synergies may as well I feel. And the extra point of attack the defender has over the guardian can be also quite nice. Plus it already combo well with the two Gondor synergies, For Gondor and Behind Strong Walls. Further great to a Háma deck…

And you don't have to pay a resource to keep it around after it defends. And it can have restricted attachments. It is, however, missing the sentinel keyword. Still, great card.

 I'm really looking forward for this new expansion to come out…I wanted gondor or dunedain trait to be implemented and I'm glad with FFG decision…let's hope leadership wil get a few good cards as well…like tactics got in SaF and in the Hobbit…!

As we already see with the slightly previewed Spirit attachment, Gondor and Dúnedain might be similar to Noldor and Silvan - in that that sometimes you shall have either option, which is neat indeed.

Well, things like Attercop, Attercop, don't care.

No card is an answer to all questions, nor it should be.

Attercop is brutally strong but the scenario doesn't hold shadow effects that would remove defenders or such, so it is easier to give it a chump or Feint it.

 The defender does seem very powerful, but I don't think he's too powerful. Firstly, he's not very good at attacking, and what with most enemies having more than one defense, he's much better as a defender. Though he appears strictly better than Winged Gaurdian, I'm hoping there will be some more eagle love in later sets (perhaps second hobbit saga pack?)

 

Also, I'm thinking that the defender will be needed in theses new scenarios, as they will be combat heavy, I'm thinking (you know, being a siege and all)

Yeah, he's probably better for solo play, but the Winged Guardian's sentinel is really helpful in multiplayer games. They fill slightly different niches, and they're both rock solid.
