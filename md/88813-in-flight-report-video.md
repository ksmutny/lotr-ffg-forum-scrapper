This a link to the FFG In-Flight Report by the CEO via Team Covenant. The Lord of the Rings section starts at around 35:26. It speaks well to the state of the game.

Thanks for that! They kept mentioning the In-Flight report in the four official videos but no mention of the LOTR line in those videos, so it's nice to see LOTR get a section here.

 

So upcoming to purchase (for those who weren't at GenCon):

 

Late Aug/Sep 2013: Black Riders

Sep 2013 (?): The Lord of the Rings: The Blood of Gondor

Oct 2013 (?): The Lord of the Rings: The Morgul Vale

Oct/November 2013(?): Stone of Erech POD (if it follows the previous GenCon POD releases)

Dec 2013: Voice of Isengard Deluxe

2014: Ring-maker AP cycle

 

Were there any LOTR questions at the end in the Q&A? I'll check when I have time.

I've just watched the whole thing through, and the only mention of LotR is in the actual presentation. The Q&A did mention communicating release dates for LCGs more effectively, but that was from a Netrunner perspective, and I've come to live with the fact that these packs turn up when they turn up, roughly once a month. But there was nothing else of interest to this game.

I can't believe I'm saying this, but thank goodness nothing more is hitting us till Oct. My wallet needs time to recover and I am personally still missing the second Hobbit expansion.

Cool video. Glad to hear that the game is doing so well. I want all of it now

Yeah. Me too. I just heard one of the first episodes of cardboardofthering some days ago (funny and good re-listening value) where one of them compares it to drugs. Well, not the game itself maybe, but the way FFG releases the news in tiny bits so you just get more and more hooked ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] and it's true. I feel an urge to come here every day, more times actually, just to check up on news and the form. Givemegivemegiveme!

100% agreed.

I think many people (me included) needs their monthly fix.

 

I log into this forum atleast once a day to check if there is any news at all, although I know I won't be getting anything more until Blood of Gondor goes public on September.
