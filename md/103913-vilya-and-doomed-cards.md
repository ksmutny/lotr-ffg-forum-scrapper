I'm sure that at the end of the day the answer will be "no", but isn't paying the "doomed" toll part of the price of the doomed cards?  If so can Vilya put these cards into play without the threat increase?

Nah, I mean from a game mechanic perspective it is not a cost, it's just a keyword.

hmmmm is quite interesting! Sounds like Vilya can avoid doom text of the players dooms cards…..but actually no  it will be a  bit stupid no? Card enter play and doom should to trigger since doom trigger when card come to play (doesn matter play or put) so i think doom will trigger.

Like GrandSpleen said, it's not a cost. So it triggers.

I agree with GrandSpleen and leptokurt. The rules of play defines what a cost is on page 8.

 

Cost: The number of resources a player must spend
from the appropriate resource pool(s) to play this card
from his hand. Cost is not found on hero cards.
 
I would say that the word "resources" is the keyword there.
