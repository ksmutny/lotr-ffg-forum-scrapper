Hi all,

if I attack an enemy with let's say 4 attack and he got no armor and 2 hitpoints, would i place 2 or 4 wound tokens on him? and would i be albe to swap the damage to another enemy with Infighting ("Action: Move any number of damage from one enemy to another.").

btw. thanks for all the help i'm getting here.

As soon as an enemy has received equal to or more damage than they have hit points, they are immediately discarded from play along with any Shadow cards that have been revealed for them.  This is of course if there are no cards that specifically state that they can't be killed until a certain condition is met(It may be possible that there exists an encounter card says they remain in play until that card is removed from play).

So in short, excess damage is lost with the enemy you killed with that damage.
