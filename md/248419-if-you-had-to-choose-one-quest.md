I am coming back to this great game after a very long period of not playing. The last quests I played were from The Ring Maker cycle and The Black Riders saga. 

I want to rekindle my love for the game. Which one of the newer quests would you recommend to me? I will play all of them eventually in order some day, but for now I want to hear about your special pick. I play 1-hand solo.

Thanks

A Shadow of the Past For newer quests, try Flame of the West. It has Battle of Pelennor Fields, which is amazing.

I would try to pick up either the sagas or the cycles from there.  So either A Shadow of the Past or The Lost Realm.

Steward's Fear.

I assume "newer quests" means from lost realm/road darkens or later, since you stopped during/after ringmaker/black riders.

The one quest I think everyone should have played is "Helm's Deep" from the 3rd saga-expansion "the treason of Saruman". It's not that easy, but capture's the theme and atmosphere the book creates perfectly. Iirc this quest also was the winner of the quests championship that was run here a while ago, so it is a bit of a "mainstream recommendation".

Yeah you only wanted "the one quest", but I can't keep myself from entioning some more, as there were many memorable quests in the newer cycles: If you love "extreme" difficulty go for "the battle of carn-Dûm" (Angmar Awakens-cycle AP 5). High replay-ability and an interessting twist for the location mechanic can be found in "temple of the deceived" (dreamchaser-cycle AP 3). My personal favourite from Harad so far is "the long arm of Mordor" (Sands of hard-box) with another take on the "captive heroes"-mechanic.

 

But as I said "Helm's Deep", for me, is the one quest you should know.

Helm's Deep is a good suggestion, if you're looking for just one quest. The Grey Havens / Dreamchaser cycle has been my favorite cycle so far, although I think Lost Realm / Angmar Awakens has the best player cards.

I have to second Steward's Fear. Such an awesome scenario. Encounter at Amon Din is also really, really fun.

Take note that it's mechanically fun, not "grind your teeth into the dust" fun. Many people complain about this quest being too easy, while failing to realize it means you can go with non-meta decks and still have fun and decent challenge without being steamrolled.

Voyage Across Belegaer (the first quest from The Grey Havens) and/or Flight of the Stormcaller (the first pack in the Dream-Chaser cycle)

I play solo one handed - i have not got all the expansions yet but i have played quite a lot. I put my thoughts about the quests (not the player cards) on my website so feel free to take a look.

Favourite quests will vary hugely from person to person depending on each players preferences for difficulty or theme. If you just want one more box (after Ring Maker) and are not thinking about the whole cycle i would go for Flame of the West saga box as it has a good mix of a quick time limited one with corsairs, a really good phantom undead scenario and an epic 5 stage quest called Battle of Pelennor Fields. Its a good all-rounder for one box and has nice heroes too. If you want a box with potential to extend into a cycle then I liked Lost Realms which has two Orc based quests and another good undead one and then i did like a lot of the Angmar cycle afterwards.

If you want to consider Stewards Fear you would have to buy the Numenor box too, so its not possible to get that quest on its own as such. I have not played Helms Deep so will put that on my list to check up on too.

I think that pretty much all quests from Lost Realm onwards are reliably good, but my pick would be Storm on Cobas Haven as my favourite quest from recent times.

Murder at the Prancing Pony or Ruins of Belegost are amazing!

I hate Helm's Deep, it's super snowbally.

Battle of Carn Dum.  You'll thank me later.

The entire Dream-Chaser cycle specifically has really varied and engaging quests I think. They are all pretty doable one handed as well.

Battle of Pelennor Fields will probably be my pick too. But helm's deep, Battle of Carn Dum, ruins of belegost and Storm on Cobas Haven also get close to be picked :).

I second both of these, Murder at the Prancing Pony remains one of my most played quests.
