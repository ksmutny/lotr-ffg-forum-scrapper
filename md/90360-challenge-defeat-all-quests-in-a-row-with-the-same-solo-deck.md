# [Challenge: defeat all quests in a row ! (with the same solo deck)](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/90360-challenge-defeat-all-quests-in-a-row-with-the-same-solo-deck/)

## 1 [Fanfan on September 14, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/90360-challenge-defeat-all-quests-in-a-row-with-the-same-solo-deck/?do=findComment&comment=865934)

I wanted to share the challenge I enjoy playing to spice my games.

 

I like having decks that attempt to have answers to the diversity of threats that the different quests offer, rather than fine-tuning them for every quest.

 

The rules: attempt all available (publicly released) quests in solo - normal mode - in a row:

 

1. Passage through Mirkwood
2. Journey along the Anduin
3. Escape from Dol Guldur
4. The hunt for Gollum       
5. Conflict at the Carrock
6. A journey to Rhosgobel     
7. The Hills of Emyn Muil
8. The dead marshes        
9. Return to Mirkwood       

10. Into the pit            
11. The seventh level       
12. Flight from Moria      
13. The redhorn gate        
14. Road to Rivendell   
15. The watcher in the water    
16. The long dark           
17. Foundations of Stone    
18. Shadow and flame        

19. We must Away, here break of day
20. Over the Misty Mountains grim
21. Dungeons deep and caverns dim
22. Flies and spiders       
23. The lonely mountain     
24. The battle of the five armies

25. Peril in Pelargir       

26. Into Ithilien           
27. The siege of Cair Andros
28. The steward's fear     
29. The druadan forest     
30. Encounter at Amon Din     
31. Assault on Osgiliath      

32. The Massing at Osgiliath    
33. The battle of laketown        
 

without changing any card of your deck between each quest (well except for adding treasures)

 

The goal is to succeed as many quests as possible (the ultimate goal being the streak of 33 !), with the average score as a tie-breaker.

 

 

 

I like this challenge for several reasons:

 

- it really tests the versatility of a deck. In fact, I think this challenge is a very efficient way to "rate" the overall quality of a deck.

 

- it adds some tension playing quests : the fact that you just don't retry if you lose adds some spice, some more thinking to the risks you take.

 

- it makes me enjoy the easy quests, that I don't play otherwise : I take them more seriously knowing that the small chance I could be beaten actually matters - and I have to put some thoughts in taking risks to shoot for a high score, which also makes them more enjoyable.

 

- it increases the storyline atmosphere : as quests are played one after the other with the same heroes, you better feel the adventure. Also, there is a special feeling anticipating the following tough quests when breathing through easier ones.

 

 

I have been attempting the challenge with my best deck, but I am also looking forward playing it with mono-sphere decks! I'd be very curious to see which sphere scores the largest number of quests!

To set the bar (hopefully high enough!), I managed to win 32 out of the 33 quests with my best deck, with an average 90.735 victory points.

 

I enjoyed it a lot and I will now attempt this challenge with mono-sphere decks.

Do you keep damage or dead heroes from one quest to another ?

## 4 [Fanfan on September 14, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/90360-challenge-defeat-all-quests-in-a-row-with-the-same-solo-deck/?do=findComment&comment=866148)

> Do you keep damage or dead heroes from one quest to another ?

 

No, I did not. First because it would favor decks with access to healing. And I think putting a single "Fortune or fate" in your deck and waiting for it once a game is virtually won would usually do the trick to save you from the dead hero problem.

 

The score keeps tracks of wounds and lost heroes. Losing one hero already harms you when playing a quest. I did not think modifying the rules was necessary.

 

In the result I reported, there are two quests where I lost a hero, plus of course the quest I lost that I conceded after losing my second hero.

Which was the one quest you lost?

> Which was the one quest you lost?

 

Well, I had a hard time against several quests ... for example:

- My threat reached 49 at some point against Escape from Dol Guldur.

- I thought I was toast when I had to resolve an 8-card collateral damage [http://www.lotrlcg.com/Card/Focus/1726] in Peril in Pelargir

- I remember sweating against Shadow and Flame

 

but it is in the Battle of Laketown that I bit the dust.

I lost a hero on turn 2 for Reckless in his rage [http://www.lotrlcg.com/Card/Focus/1529], and a second hero on turn 4 to the second Reckless in his rage. I had an answer in hand, but did not save ressources to play it, as I had chosen to use it to play an ally. My single hero facing the reckless dragon conceded and went back home, leaving Laketown to its burning fate!

I did something similar a while back with a spirit/lore deck (Eowyn, Frodo and Aragorn, if i recall correctly), but that was prior to the first Hobbit box coming out. Sounds like a fun challenge.

What was your deck?

## 9 [Fanfan on September 14, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/90360-challenge-defeat-all-quests-in-a-row-with-the-same-solo-deck/?do=findComment&comment=866336)

> What was your deck?

 

Well, I'd be audacious enough to think that this deck may be the best currently available.

So I am going to ask a little something before sharing my preciously-kept deck list:

Have someone beat the performance of this deck !

(Either by winning the 33 quests in a row, or 32 with a lower average score)

Let it be a little teaser to encourage people to try this enjoyable challenge !

My outland deck (Hurluin, Theodred, Beravor) beat everything but Dol Guldur, when I did this awhile back. I have yet to make any modifications since Steward's Fear. I only made modifications for AJtR, with some healing cards, so I guess they were 31 out of 33. . Avg score 82.3, and probably more than 95% of the scenarios were first attempt wins.

Edit

So your deck must include at least 3 or more cards for healing damage. Or i don't see how AJtR would be possible, Either, healing Herbs or Lore of Imladris. Personally, unless a scenario calls for those types of healing cards there pretty much a waste of deck space

That's a fairly good guess. The goal of the deck is to consistently win every quest in normal mode. And I agree there is a small adjustment I made to the deck thinking about A Journey to Rhosgobel. The issue was to make the selection of cards that would dramatically increase my chances against AJtR without being detrimental to the other quests.

 

And in fact, the loss I had against the Battle of Laketown was not where my odds are the worst. That's the appeal of this challenge: you need a deck that's consistent.

 

> My outland deck (Hurluin, Theodred, Beravor) beat everything but Dol Guldur, when I did this awhile back.

 

This certainly sounds like a strong selection of heroes. But there is a good 10 quests that are not automatic wins, especially the ones putting a strong early pressure where outland deck is still fragile. Treacheries damaging all characters could be tough when Anfalas herdsman [http://www.lotrlcg.com/Card/Focus/1786] refuses to show, and heavy staging areas can present a challenge when Ethir swordsmen [http://www.lotrlcg.com/Card/Focus/1784] hide deep down in the deck. But I agree that this deck looks like a good contender!

My other deck that handled all quests, except the past few since i had not tried it, was Frodo, Glorfindel spirit, and Aragorn Lore. Unfortunately, i don't have all the stats for the quest. Much more consistent then outlands, but its also a slower deck. It's probably my most solid deck.

I think Dwarfs will always be the top tier in this game, i have 2 Dwarf decks that beat all the quests (nightmare to) with very high chance of success  ( i like playing with Elfs better tho ^_^ [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_happy.png] ) i don't have the time for your test tho buddy :mellow: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_mellow.png]

Dwalfs, Elves and Outlands can beat every quest i the game regually. Last time I did it was before outlands and I got 100%, though I have tested my various decks vs all the "hardest". I feel you could get 100% with any of those 3 deck lists.

> I have 2 Dwarf decks that beat all the quests (nightmare to) with very high chance of success

 

I agree dwarfs are still top tier, but no - they do not win solo Nightmare Escape from Dol Guldur on a regular basis ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] . That quest is very seriously tough.

Yes, I certainly think it is possible to do the 33 in a row with one of these decks - but it is not that easy. Consistently winning the whole Mirkwood cycle (Escape from Dol Guldur - A Journey to Rhosgobel - Return to Mirkwood) is already not that automatic. And there are many other quests that could sometimes turn tough!

This is what I'm setting out to do with four monosphere decks from this week, but I don't expect to come anywhere near 32 wins with any of the four. Some are just crazy match-ups (only Lore can win Rhosgobel, only Spirit has a chance against Return to Mirkwood, and Tactics could be a train wreck all the way if Trained for War doesn't show up early enough for Hama to recycle).

That's what I am planning to do to ! I will be glad to compare what we get ! And indeed, I am pretty sure I won't reach 32 with any monosphere deck either ! I'd be already be glad to shoot for a 25-30, but I may seriously be wrong.

 

Just a last clarification. There are several possible definitions for mono-sphere, like: can you include cards from other spheres ? or could you have elrond in a 100 % tactics deck ? I suggest sticking with the definition encouraged by FFG.

A deck is considered as mono-sphere if all its hereoes have the same printed icon.

 

It will take me a little time as I am still working on fine-tuning the mono-sphere decks, but I expect to have one finding a passage through Mirkwood soon ... and then be on its own for a very long journey!

I am looking forward to sharing our results and see which sphere best stands alone !

Trying to do this, Outlands and Dwarves are the most close.

Are you really serious in saying that you "test" a deck over 33 games? Well, I thought I have given more than a fair share of spare time to my gaming, having had played well over 1000 games since its release. Still, I wouldn't want to invest that much time into testing a deck, you're talking about 10 to 15 hours easily, with all the set up. But I wish the designers and play-testers would be so willing.

 

Each to his own, but I find it much better to select few "prototypes" of quest to do the same thing. I would always exclude quests that require certain specific strategy which is not seen anywhere else: like A Journey to Rhosgobel. And I would certainly not want to reply some of the more boring quests like A Long Dark. Choosing something between six to eight tougher and more dynamic quests, each requiring slightly different skills but not diverging too much from the basic mechanics of the game, seem to be a good way to test a deck.

My four decks only have cards from that sphere and Neutral cards, so no Songs / Vilya etc. to splash other spheres into the deck. It makes it even more difficult to get results as it is almost impossible to cancel in-sphere weaknesses. But I really want to explore how well individual spheres, with their own pros and cons,  are now equipped to handle the game.

 

I will probably not run identical decks and heroes all the way through as it will take a while to get done and new cards may be released that need to be included. Theoden, Sam, Scroll of Isildur are certainly candidates to come into play at some stage.

Yes, we are exactly on the same line.

 

I am only playing the 33 to find out 'what is the very best deck' in an unforgiving enjoyable challenge. But I am currently testing a mono-spirit deck and I took a selection of 3-4 quests to do so (Into Ithilien, Journey down the Anduin, The seventh level) ... before attempting the 33 once I think I have found the best mono-spirit deck. I am still struggling ... spirit definitely has issues getting rid of big guys.

 

Also, I am playing most of my games on OCTGN which goes way faster than hand-shuffling. Using the shortcuts, the games usually play quite fast. I am just playing with real cards the recent quests that do not have pictures yet on OCTGN.

Happy to report that I've started the challenge with 4 mono-sphere decks. 

 

Since I'm limiting all decks to cards of that sphere + neutral, I'm not going to make it even more difficult by sticking to the exact same deck and heroes for all scenarios, so strictly speaking it's not a one deck to beat them all type campaign.

 

All scenarios to be played in Normal mode, with 50-card decks and adhering to all FAQ changes.

 

Fortunately no early hiccups, all four spheres beat Passage Through Mirkwood. Lore (Aragorn, Denethor, Mirlonde) and Leadership (Aragorn, Theodred, Gloin) both had tough openings against a number of enemies but established board control after about 6 rounds. Spirit (Eowyn, Dunhere, Glorfindel) breezed through, as expected with the round's best score of 69. Tactics (Boromir, Hama, Legolas) was a blast. An early Ungoliant's Spawn was dragged from the SA by a Knight of Minas Tirith and later that round shot down by a Legolas Black Arrow and Hama, who recycled a Trained for War to race through the scenario at near Spirit pace. If not for the minor delay that was Beorn's Path Tactics would have come close to the Spirit score.

 

Journey Down the Anduin up tomorrow.

I am on my way too !

 

But I am proceeding each sphere one after the other.

 

I playtested Spirit and I struggled a lot at the beginning. I seriously thought about going with Secrecy. I finally found a deck I was satisfied with. I found (as usual) that cheap allies was usually the best answer when you are struggling between two choices. The deck is doing fairly well for now, but I am currently playing the 'easy part' (The Khazad Dum cycle and the Hobbit saga), The real tests will come with Heirs of Numenor.

 

I hope to report soon !

I love what you guys are doing with the mono-sphere solo decks.  Looking forward to getting your assessments of which spheres are strongest now that the card pool is getting respectably deep.

I am about to report on my challenge run with my mono-spirit deck:

 

Here is the list I played.

 

Frodo Baggins

Glorfindel

Eowyn

 

Ally (26)

 

Bofur  x  1

Eomund  x  1

Damrod  x  1

Arwen Undomiel  x  2

Elfhelm  x  2

Emery  x  3

Gandalf (OHAUH)  x  3

 

Northern tracker  x  3

The riddermark's finest  x  3

Pelargir shipwright  x  3

Minas Tirith Lampwright  x  3

White tower watchman  x  1

 

Attachment (7)

 

Unexpeted courage  x  2

Ancient Mathom  x  2

Light of Valinor  x  3

 

Event  (17)

 

Hasty stroke  x  3

A test of will  x  3

Stand and fight  x  2

Dwarven tomb  x  3

Elrond's counsel  x  3

O Elbereth! Githonial !  x  1

The Galadhrim's greeting  x  2

 

 

the same list with comments:

 

 

Frodo Baggins

Glorfindel

Eowyn

 

      I once though going for secrecy, especially with a starting threat so close to 20! But it turns out that the available secrecy cards in neutral / spirit sphere are not very strong. These three heroes are just so much stronger and versatile than the others in the spirit sphere. I though about Dunhere for his two attack and rohan trait, and Caldara, but I stuck with the 3 heroes with the best individual potential.

 

Ally (26)

 

Bofur  x  1

     I playtested with 2 but this deck is not the one where he shines the most

Eomund  x  1

     There are a bunch of Rohan characters in this deck, and you can usually ready one ally and Eowyn for 2-3 extra attack after defending with Eomund. Eomund will shine with future expansions, but he is ok in this deck

Damrod  x  1

      His stats are just ok, but attack strength is so much lacking in spirit that I think he is worth the slot.

Arwen Undomiel  x  2

Elfhelm  x  2

      Arwen and Elfhelm are two extremely strong allies, but not that mandatory to include three and be very likely to draw extras.

Emery  x  3

      I decided to go with 3 times Emery, because her 'drawback' is actually entirely beneficial, with a deck including  Stand and fight  and dwarven tombs, and no strong "draw and discard" mechanic that deplete a deck very fast. And well, she is free -- in a resource limited deck 

Gandalf (OHAUH)  x  3

      Gandalf is a very strong card, his high defense and attack are almost mandatory for  battles  and sieges, and his 4 attack is needed for tough minions like Smaug and the Balrog. There are efficient way s to play around his threat cost in the spirit sphere, meaning you usually keep him every turn if you play him late in the game after playing everything else you had.

 

Northern tracker  x  3

      No brainer

The riddermark's finest  x  3

      His ability can be useful, he readies with Eomund, he has 1 attack strength for 2, which is not that easy in spirit, 2 life ... all these details make him a reliable filler.

Pelargir shipwright  x  3

      3 willpower and 3 life points for 3 resources make him a nearly no-brainer. 

Minas Tirith Lampwright  x  3

     Cheapest blocker (disregarding Emery) in spirit. His power is to consider very carefully, but can be very handy. A good situation to use his power is when:

- you are questing for tons and have one or two test of will - in that situation treacheries and locations are not a worry and you can take the risk of shooting a minion.

- you have a good idea that the encounter deck is strongly dominated by one kind of cards.

White tower watchman  x  1

     I playtested with more - he sounds great being able to handle one small and one big attack, but he did

     not prove being that strong - I usually prefere paying one more for an attack-2 ally.

 

 

Attachment (7)

 

Unexpeted courage  x  2

     This is usually a crazy card, but not that much in this deck that has light of Valinor for Glorfindel, and Eowyn being quite poor in the combat phase if you cna ready her. It is nice to put one on Frodo, but the second one is not very strong. Putting two in the deck is probably the right number.

Ancient Mathom  x  2

     The most efficient way to draw cards in Spirit, but you rarely want to have 2 with your limited resources. Good target for dwarven tomb in long games.

Light of Valinor  x  3

      No brainer with Gorfindel - having it in your starting hand is a strong component for the muligan decision. You can discard extra with Eowyn

 

Event  (17)

 

Hasty stroke  x  3

      strong, cheap and flexible

A test of will  x  3

      No brainer

Stand and fight  x  2

      Very good card, but you don't really have combos with it in this deck with the timing of playing allies, and you sometimes prefer just drawing an ally in the early game, than being able to reuse one if he is discarded.

Dwarven tomb  x  3

      This card shines in a mono-spirit deck. Yes you pay one more for the card, but there are so many good targets depending on the situation ... Elrond's councel, A test of will, ancient mathom, athe galadhrim's greeting, O Elbereth, a strong ally you discarded, or a cheap blocker.

Elrond's counsel  x  3

      This card is very strong, especially in a deck limited in resources and including Frodo

O Elbereth! Githonial !  x  1

      This card is an oddball. You can sometimes play it for free, but even for 4, it is quite often a very good answer to nasty minions, including unique ones immune to atachments. I really struggled between including a second one or another cheap ally.

The Galadhrim's greeting  x  2

      This card is virtually 6 more life for Frodo at worse. It offers a lot of flexibility. I could have included three but I prefered going strong on allies. But is is a frequent target for dwarven tomb.

 

Other cards I considered:

 

Against the shadow

it sounded ok with cards like Eowyn, but it paled in comparison to The Galadhrim's greeting ... just one less resource, but 6 more life sounded better than a boost of defense, and it is much more flexible.

 

KIli

I though about adding a package of 2 Kilis + 1 Fili, but it did not make the cut ... yes, either 2 attack or 2 cheap blockers for just three resources. But it happens pretty often that you just draw Fili, or that Fili discards Emery, bith being frustraing.

 

There are no other cards that struck me as being worth a spot. Once I settled on the heroes, it was more in the selection of the number of each cards (previously discussed) that I had to do the fine tuning. My overall decision was to prioritize cheap allies for flexibility, over expensive contextual events.

And here is my report for my mono-spirit attempt.

 

I succeeded in 27 quests out of the 33. I have mixed feelings. I had to work much harder to achieve this result than the one of my best deck, probably because the deck does not have the same row power, and also because I did not know it well. But it made the experience even more enjoyable!

 

Here are my 6 defeats:

- A journey to Rhosgobel

Well, there is not much to say about it, my chances are quite small and there is a lot of randomness here. The deck can crazy quest if you happen to have a lucky Athelas draw in the first 5 encounter cards. You still have a chance later in the game with the good location and threat manipulation, but it is mainly up to the encounter deck. The game I played here did not leave any chance.

- Return to Mirkwood

I raced through Return to Mirkwood knowing a single big guy (Hill Troll or Attercop) could ruin me, but racing sounded as the best plan anyway. I revealed Hill Troll on the last stage of the quest when my threat was already high. My party was too small to handle him and my threat rocketed.

- Dungeons deep and caverns dim

This was a surpring defeat as I thought mono-sphere would have an easy time with riddles ... I still think this was a very unlucky defeat. Bilbo missing to answer 3 riddles was unlikely to happen.

- The lonely mountain

There is one critical turn in the lonely mountain : the first turn where Smaug the Magnificient shows up. In this game, he killed 5 of my characters on that turn and I could not come back.

- Into Ithilien

This is probably the toughest quest for mono-spirit (maybe with A Journey to Rhosgobel). The simple fact it starts with a tough battle makes it hard. I managed to empty the staging area and encounter cards in play at one time, O Gilbereth-ed the Mumak, but achieving that had cost my little party too much and they could not make it through the end of the quest.

- The siege of Cair Andros

I did not manage to have a large enough board when the battelgrounds got claimed/destroyed ... then I drew a few tough opponents I had difficulties to deal with, like Lieutenant of Mordor activating southron support, when a battering ram was already in play.

 

I'd say A journey to Rhosgobel and Into Ithilien were likely defeats,

Return to Mirkwood and Siege of Cair Andros were tough quests that could have gone either way,

and Dungeons deep and caverns dim and The lonely mountain were unlucky defeats, with several streaks of bad luck on what looked like easy riddles, and an awful chain of attacks from Smaug the Magnificient.

 

But I also had succesfull quests:

Escape from Dol Guldur

I kept a hand with Light of Valinor and Northern Tracker. Glorfindel was the prisonner, but I could still play Northern tracker on turn 2 ... who basically did all the work. Actually, the match up for my mono-spirit deck against EfDG is not too bad: the only very annoying encounter cards are the low engagement-threat allies, because the deck usually quests well even with just 2 heroes. The game was long and tough, but globally went the right way.

Shadow and Flame

The battle of Laketown

I had playtested against Smaug, and found that I needed to pack attack strength to win the Battle of Laketown, and slowly manage my threat until I had enough. The same was true for Shadow and flame. And it worked.

Massing at Osgiliath

I don't consider it a very  tough quest to beat with this deck, but it went very smoothly: an ithilien ranger popped just before I had to cross the Anduin, and O Elbereth Githonial got rid of the Witch King.

The steward's fear

I think I had my closest victory ever on this one. I achieved the quest with only 2 cards in play, i.e. 2 heroes with one life remaining only, no attachment left, no ally left, 47 threats and a local trouble on both of my heroes, 3 cards left in deck with the plot aiming at empty my deck for the win, discarding my last card in hand for Eowyn to get the very last quest point.

I would have lost at the end of the turn to:

- the plot emptying my deck,

- the engaged minions slaugthering my two near-death exhausted heroes.

- the local troubles + threat increase in the refresh phase

 

I am buying a virtual drink to anyone who could share a more desperate lucky ending !

 

Conclusion:

 

I think mono-spirit can hope for a 30/33 with some luck, but it seems 27/33 is a an ok-result. I slightly improved my playing of the deck during this enjoyable run, but I don't think I did any obvious critical mistake that would have turned the tide. Losing the 2 hobbit quests was particularly unlucky.

 

RESULT FOR MONO-SPIRIT:

 

27 / 33   (98.67 average score)

I tried the first 9 quests (base 3 plus Mirkwood cycle) with a few different decks, and I'm not having nearly as much success as you guys.  This is pretty much the first time I've tried playing single handed, and I'm beginning to appreciate how much more challenging some scenarios can be solo.  Dol Goldur, Carrock, Rhosgobel, and Return to Mirkwood in particular are near impossible.  My best deck so far is Spirfindel, Beregond, and Faramir, but that deck wasn't able to beat any of those 4 on the first try.  I did beat Carrock and Mirkwood, but it pretty much requires light of valinor and Asfaloth in my starting hand.  The highlight so far was being able to one-shot a hill troll in the staging area with Faramir.
