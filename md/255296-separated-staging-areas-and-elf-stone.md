Hi,

How you resolve the following situation?

We are playing Fog in the Barrow Downs, we are on stage 3B. On the active location there is an Elf-Stone. During the quest phase the first player reveals a Great Barrow and gets separated from the group, creating his own staging area. The "main group" manages to clean the active location. The elf-stone states that the first player gets to put an ally into play, but the first player is on another staging area and cannot be affected by cards in the "main staging area". Is the effect of the elf-stone lost?

Sounds like it.

I've always been reluctant to use Elf-stone in multiplayer games, it never works out how you want it to.

Don't know for sure, but once upon a time there was a ruling that said every staging area has its own first player.  Here's the thread reference:
