Hi there,

Besides the official FAQ I also use a FAQ started by "Kirk Bauer" that is on the 7.0 version, is there a newer one?

Thanks!

Version 7.1 was posted by Kelly B who now keeps updating the unofficial FAQ. Here is the link: javascript:void(0);/*1352192847097*/ [http://www.boardgamegeek.com/filepage/82879/comprehensive-card-list-and-unofficial-faq]
