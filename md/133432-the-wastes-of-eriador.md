First thing I'll note - side quests now have a sphere. So, prepare to get half of the pack's player cards as a side quests.

I'm not sure it was negative, and it is something to be aware of.

 

This pack does sound exciting. That "night" mechanic looks brutal, from the little bit I can make out.

Anyone else noticed that it says "Angmar Awakened ... [is an] epic nine-scenario adventure"? I first thought that this probably includes the three adventures from the Deluxe expansion but the article explicitly says that this takes place after The Lost Realm.

What? There is nothing negative about my post, just plain facts. If you seen this as something negative, then you just percieve those facts as something negative. What a hypocrite.

The two pieces of cardboard that came with the old packaging were very helpful for organizing cards in the box - I hope they are still included in this new plastic packaging.

 

Very excited for new Noldor synergy! I think it is interesting that they are choosing to focus on Spirit rather than Leadership or Lore.

Cool article.  Some thoughts:

 * The night mechanic looks great.  It was awesome in Stone of Erech, so I'm looking forward to it again here.
 * I like the valour idea and it feels like an appropriate foil to secrecy.  Just imagine the epic stories that can arise from some of these valour actions.
 * The more I see about side quests, the more I know I'm never going to include them in my deck.
 * Looking forward to more Hobbits.  I wonder if there will be another Hobbit hero this cycle.
 * The Door is Closed looks like it could be another Test of Will, which would really surprise me.
 * This quote intrigues me.  I wonder if it's a hint at the Hero.  "Finally, Spirit players will be able to explore what it really means to be a Noldor Elf, with cards that introduce a new strategy for the High Elves of Middle-earth."
 * I'm not excited about the new packaging, but it doesn't make much difference to me because I throw them out anyway.

I always thought a night/day mechanic is what the game needed from the core rules... but oh well, it's great to see it even if just on a few scenarios. Anyway, great preview yet again FFG! These cards look amazing, it's awesome to see sphered side quests (I just loved the side quests) and the valour keyword is the perfect counterpart to secrecy, something we really needed. The Veteran of Osgiliath is precisely what aggro Leadership Gondor decks needed, that is a heavy hitter. And even without the valour trigger, he's still 3 attach with Boromir! Awesome! The rest of the cards look pretty amazing as well, the only bad this is that they're all blocked! But still, the art looks great, and it's also great to see some new songs. I'm really excited for this cycle.

I am super excited for this cycle! And side quests look great to me, I'll gladly play them.

 

The cards look great, they all have some new mechanics that have not been explored yet.

 

I am so happy that Lost Realm + Angmar Awakened is coming. I am totally growing tired of Ringmaker cycle, haven't even played Celebrimbor's Secret yet and I do not like Time mechanic. Glad that I see Battle/Siege coming back on the sidequests.

 

Good times.

Two more things.  Does Honour Gaurd work on Beorn?  The wording is different than Dori.

 

Also, expected release is Q2.  Does anyone believe that?  I expect July or August.

I'm excited! I fell in love with Rangers when they first came out. That neutral one with the Haldir stats looks pretty cool!

 

Also, It looks like Lore may have some cancellation, if I'm reading The Door is Closed right. Limited, sure, but it's something!

> First thing I'll note - side quests now have a sphere. So, prepare to get half of the pack's player cards as a side quests.

 

It looks like there were 2 neutral cards, and 3 red cards... and at least 2 green cards.

 

Maybe purple is only to get 1 card, but it looks like, to me, they might just give a single copy of the side quests as a "bonus" rather than 3 copies like with Path of Need.

Plastic?  Yuck.

 

"In addition to its new scenario, The Wastes of Eriador also contains a new hero and three copies each of nine different player cards. In the lands traveled so often by the Rangers of the North, you’ll find new Dúnedain, Hobbits, Scouts, and side quests."

 

I don't think the side quests are player cards.

If you pay attention, you'll notice that Door is Closed is directly tied to the lore side quest included in the pack.

Maybe I'm just being blind, but what makes you think it's tied to the side quest?  It looks like Test of Will, except for the clause "if there is a card with _____e in the victory display."  I don't have a good guess for what that blank would be.

But that quote just listed side quests in the same sentence with other player cards.  If anything, I think that confirms that they are player cards.

Is it certain that all the cards are really from this pack, and not from the cycle? The announcement for Dunland trap spoiled some cards from later in the cycle. I'd expect something like 1 side quest per sphere plus a few neutrals for the whole thing. two neutrals in one pack would also be unusual.

My bet would be is that this Lore event cancels a card, copy of which is in the victory display (not just treachery), and if you look at this:

MEC39fan.png [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/ffg_content/lotr-lcg/angmar-awakened/mec39-the-wastes-of-eriador/MEC39fan.png]

You'll see a Lore side quest that does what? Oh, snap! It lets you add a card from the encounter deck to the victory display!

He certainly would!  "Cancel damage," sounds the same as that Doomed tactics event ("Close Call" I think?).  Sorry, not in a position to look it up at the moment.

 

But the moment I saw that Honor Guard I thought, wow!  Welcome to your brand new Beorn "cancel 3 damage every round" defense!

Honor Guard is a great card, glad to see some repeatable damage cancellation for tactics. Something tells me it's going to be seeing a lot of play, especially when not using Lore to get healing.

Love the new valor keyword, that's going to be awesome.

Right, I followed that much.  There are other cards that do that too.  I thought you were implying it had something specifically to do with side quests.

 

I really hope it doesn't require a card with the same name in the victory display, because that would make it sooo situational.  Although if you could use it on non-treacheries, I guess that would be nice.  The partial letter before the e doesn't look like it could be an m though.  Looks more like an l or d.  Joezim would be able to figure this out.

Tactics Boromir + Gondorian Shield + Honor Guard = WIN. And then using readying by raising your threat by 1 (and you will be quickly around 40 for Valour effects).

The Door is Closed looks beautiful, and at first glance I was overjoyed for seeing another card that could cancel treacheries (among other things). But now I fear the missing word is "title," which would make the card very situational -- even if there suddenly were several different cards to put encounters into victory display.

My thought as well, but since it targets the damage and not Beorn it should work.

Either Ranger of Cardolan is an objective ally or we are getting two neutrals.  Unless, as pointed out, some of these cards are not from this pack.

I am very excited to see this, and even though I am still catching up on old scenarios (I have not played the Ringmaker Cycle yet, although I have it!) I am probably even more excited about Angmar Awakened. I am especially curious about the side quest mechanics as well as night/day. 

 

Also gotta say that I love the Valor feature. I have found Secrecy difficult to play, but Valor should kick into gear in most my games!  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I think it's crystal clear that these side quests are indeed player cards. The last preview for the Lost Real confirmed it. Also, Trololo is right in that The Door is Closed cancels a card of which another copy is in the victory display, so the Lore side quest basically guarantees you that you will be able to cancel it if it appears. Pretty good!

 

Does anyone else absolutely love the art on these cards?

I was actually hoping for some break in the game. I noticed quite often that there were lacks of content release.

Well, to be fair he's just there to prevent damage. To be honest I really really like these two new Gondor allies. They are IMO exactly what Gondor needed, especially Leadership Gondor with the Veteran, but also Tactics Boromir will love the Guard. Gondor decks will be now more viable than ever, which is what we should have gotten at the end of the Against the Shadow cycle! Well, better late than never.

What it means to be a Noldor elf in the spirit sphere?  Glorfindel, Duh?   What does this mean?

 

Valor is big boost for doom player cards, as well as high threat hero combinations.  There are a lot more hero combinations that start with high threat then secrecy hero combinations,  so I think many of these cards will be very useful to decks that don't fret about high threat.

## 42 [Gizlivadi on January 29, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/133432-the-wastes-of-eriador/?do=findComment&comment=1426998)

Out of the Wild + Scout Ahead will work great with The Door is Closed! I could see a secrecy deck with Lore and Spirit with Test of Will for treacheries, and the two new cards for enemies or locations. Maybe also a Dwarf deck that uses Zigil Miner and mining-the--deck cards. You could be able to really prohibit the encounter deck from playing its most deadly cards. Maybe this could be the birth of a new archetype?

So much new content around which is great but hard to know what to buy first.

Packaging is as real disappointment though as I liked that the deck protected encounter cards in each set fitted perfect to a box (player cards store in separate run). Also it spoils the collection - sigh.

Noldor has had a sub-theme of (player) deck manipulation.  Not all of the cards have supported it, but a lot of them have.

Scout Ahead, the Lore side quest is great. So in solo play you get to look at top 5 cards, throw 1 into the victory display, and put the remaining 4 back in any order. That's a good level of control there. Too bad it's only 1 per deck, although that's a good thing from a balance perspective.

You can choose to use the non-Valour response if you have 40+ threat.

 

It's just saying that Valour responses are allowed when you have 40+ threat, and not less than 40.

They totally nailed it with the damage preventing for Tactics. Not only it makes heavy or mono Tactics a lot more viable, but it's really fitting as well, as damage prevention means more or less that you're such a good warrior that can evade or block the enemy's blows.  I don't get it when people say it's not thematic or shouldn't be in Tactics.

Dear Americans, it is "valoUr" and "honoUr". Although this very software is trying to take to Us out. I am very happy they went with the British spelling (though I'm not one), I had long been bothered by the missing U in the Favour of the Lady.

As for the Honour Guard, his basic response still seems better than the Valour one, though of course it is nice to have that utility. A great card for Tactics. And with the Veteran, the great couple to boost Tactics-Leadership Gondor decks. Boromir!

## 53 [lleimmoen on January 30, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/133432-the-wastes-of-eriador/?do=findComment&comment=1427531)

Finally, I too wonder about the Spirit Noldor thing. But I am so glad they will pay attention to it in this cycle. Of course, Noldor are already strong thanks to Glorindel and Elrond but the number of cards is relatively small. They need more to be better defined.

 

ps: Has anyone worked out the Door is Closed?

Man when it rains it pours! News on treason, lost realm and now this all so close together! Now we just gotta wait for them to actually come out :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

To be completely honest I'm not really sure what I think of player card side quests yet..... they are going to change the experience of all existing quests a fair bit. They may be less useful for ring maker and VOI considering time counters will still be removed each turn whether you choose the current quest to be the one from the quest deck or a side quest. Both the lore and tactics ones look very powerful as does the neutral one.

The new gondor allies look fantastic art wise and valour is an awesome ability. I really hope a Silvan or Noldor character gets that keyword and not just men. I also really love that as well as valour there will be cards that will instead read "when your threat is 40 or above" and will give you a beneficial effect if it is much like the cycle they did in ring maker that read "Then, if your threat is 20 or less and this is the first time you played a copy of x this round, return this card to your hand instead of discarding it".

 

All those 1 cost events look VERY interesting as well, especially the tactics one which seems to have a valour action. Judging from its name and flavour that can be seen perhaps it allows you to ready one character? The valour action cannot be seen at all... readying all characters would not fit in that space and would be FAR too good for 1 resource. what could it be?

Surely The Door is Closed reads: Response: After an encounter card is revealed from the encounter deck, cancel its effects and discard it if there is a card with the same title in the victory display.

 

Also pretty interesting that valour will only appear for leadership and tactics and not the other two spheres but they will get their own new mechanics. I'm looking forward most as far as player cards are concerned to the "new strategy" for the Noldor trait however as it will fit perfectly with my lore/spirit silvan/noldor deck.

Not wanting to sound like an elf-hater, but when exactly did the Elves showed bravery against impossible odds in the trilogy? Mind you, I'm specifically referring to the trilogy, because the game itself is centered around those times. One can argue about Glorfi's stand vs the Nazgul outside Rivendell, but this isn't enough to merit the "Valour" keyword. That one has killed a Balrog single-handedly in ancient times and even the Nazgul feared him. Frankly, the Hobbits merit the keyword much more than the Elves.

 

Edit: If I had to give the keyword to an Elf, only Legolas would have been a worthy candidate. Only him and for obvious reasons.

As for the actual question, it stays. Anyone? Could this really only cancel and discard a card of the same title as the one in VD?

Pretty cool stuff, by the looks of it. Nice to see a counterbalance to Secrecy, which pairs nicely with doomed cards. I think we can get to 38 starting threat, if we load up with Elrond, Gandalf and Aragorn (or even Lore Glorfindel...will he make a resurgence...?). So that's only 2 off valouring in the first turn :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

I'll have to wait and see about side-quests. They could be interesting, kinda like player-locations, but I can't think about how they'll work in reality until I try using them. At the very least it's a progression.

I really like this new keyword. So much of LoTR deck design and game play is about minimising threat. We have had secrecy for a while as well which has kept this idea of low threat in mind as well. I know I personally have always concentrated on low threat. This will open up a ton of new deck building choices as well as allow some new balances in multi-player.

Yeah I think this is a excellent addition and I expect that designing decks for 40+ may lead to a lot of cards getting pulled out of mothballs.

This is exactly why I find the new keyword so cool - it's actively encouraging a shift in play. I know there are people out there who play high-threat decks, but the game has given little encouragement for this generally. Good to see it!

And...

Grima.

Just gotta imagine it differently.  Grima cooperates with your fellowship but subverts your objectives whenever he can do so without being discovered.  As a result, you risk drawing too much of the Enemy's attention, and a little extra Valour is soon required by the other characters in your party...

Well the card's name (Hold Your Ground) and art implies defending. I would think it would be something like "Ready one defending character " as the normal action, but as for the Valour action... I don't know. I was thinking that maybe it said something like "Do this action twice" but that wouldn't work because only one character defends at a time... Hmm.

Feels like the Valour mechanic will make Galadriel even more relevant - get to 40, but keep it down after that.

If the goal is to support defending, the Valour action could be something like "Target one character, that character does not exhaust to defend this round." Fairly strong, I think, but the 40 threat requirement means your are in the "danger zone" and keeps it from being good with Frodo, at least in the same deck.

Why would it be good with Frodo even without the valour? Frodo can trigger his response once per phase, if not once per round, if I recall correct.

> I think, but the 40 threat requirement means your are in the "danger zone" and keeps it from being good with Frodo

Seams that Frodo would be the fastest way to hit 40 though action, but you could just as easily hit 40 by simply not questing. Eat a ton of threat on turn 1 and just wipe out all the monsters. There could be a solo deck here that doesn't quest at all (practically). Threat reduction, token placers, blades etc etc. These high monster eDecks could lead to a entire new way to play. Doomed will also make a big play for solo, but in multiplayer there could be problems with how it effects the entire table.

Still I think in multi-player Frodo looks like the fastest and most reliable way to have a single player hit 40 while having the other players quest and stay under. Whack a Battle + Mocking Song and you have some powerful wound absorption across the entire table, especially when you build with other absorb effects. Mocking isn't unique or limited in any way, you could have 3 on Frodo easy.

Not been as excited for a set for a while, this new keyword is very exciting for the changes in deck building it is encouraging and unlike Secrecy it is much easier to hit the threshold. At first I thought it might lead to a drop in the need for as much threat reduction, but having 40 threat could make those reduction cards more important not less.

I am of the opinion that we will get a card or two that allows the Valour player to reduce or set their threat to 40.  The reason is that once you are at 40 you are only a couple of Doomed cards away from losing.

 

Or perhaps a way to convert threat to damage?  That would be a twist.

I'd be disappointed if there was a 40 reset of some sort. Seams to me that would remove the skill in piloting the deck as well as designing it.

Thanks for the vote of confidence. Early looks seem to indicate that the cards need to have the same title. I was hoping to not spoil the cards for myself this time, but since everyone is already discussing them so much, I might try to verify the wording on some cards.

I personally like the idea of a card needing to already be in the victory display. It gives new life to Out of the Wild, which Ive been wanting to play recently but kept choosing Risk Some Light instead. Obviously the duplicate title restriction weakens the card, but makes it far more interesting and prevents it from becoming overpowered or just expensive.

Lore Aragorn?

I'm toying with the idea of using Grima, Lore Aragorn & suitable leadership or tactics hero, depending on the valour cards.

Ramp up your threat with Grima (or Frodo if you play multiplayer)

While doing that, get your valour cards out on the table.

Once you are in your 40s use them as needed and then reset your threat with Aragorn.

This is a hero choice, and you would need to pick heroes to start above 40 =< for it to work, though raising the threat isn't hard after the reset. Still this is a little different from having a card that you can put 3 copies on to just rest to 40 from lower or higher.

Paper comes from a renewable resource and can be recycled; plastic typically relies on petroleum and most f it ends up in landfills.

Lore/Leadership also has cool doomed cards, which also accelerate valour. Loragorn is a very cool idea!

More? It's not really that Elrond, Gandalf and Loragorn are underused heroes! The cool this about Valour is that other high threat heroes get to be played more, because valour ups the synergie they have with the deck. The guys you named are powerhouses in their own right. I'm courious whether valour will make underused high willpower heroes (looking at you, Brand) more playable.

Not sure I agree with that... I feel like cancellation effects should be exist in moderation in the card pool (especially for When Revealed effects) because they are so powerful. Otherwise, it becomes too easy to just negate a single card type (treacheries) when playing the game. Plus, I like that When Revealed cancellation is mainly a strength of the Spirit sphere; adds some interesting restrictions to deckbuilding. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I didn't read the article fully until now, but I'm intrigued about the "new strategies" for Noldor players. I thought the Ringmaker cycle was the most elvish stuff we were going to get for some time, but I'm not a huge fan of the bouncy mechanics.

Cancellation may not be essential, but I've lost way too many games due to the inability to cancel things. I'm not looking for anything nearly as simple and straightforward as Spirit's cancellation. I'm looking for something more akin to the new Lore event. It needs to be set up before you can cancel anything, and you're very limited in what you can cancel. Tactics and Leadership should have something similar. It doesn't need to be treachery cancellation. If it cancels something specific to enemies, that's great too. If it can only cancel something if you've destroyed an enemy earlier that round, then it'll only work in direct damage decks, and that'll be fine. Make it as situational as you want, but I think every sphere should have some kind of cancellation, especially when it comes to multiplayer, where the effects can potentially more dangerous and far more chances are given to the encounter deck to reveal its dark side. Heck just give tactics some shadow cancellation and skip the encounter cancellation.

 

Spirit excels at so many things. I just want each sphere to have a minor way to contribute more than numbers toward defeating the scariest parts of the encounter decks: card effects.

There is a fine line. Give tactics some cancellation and it will become staple and will be put in each and every tactics deck. Restrict it too much and it will almost never see the light of day. Things like this are extremely hard to balance.

yup, I'd rather not see cancellation in either leadership or tactics. Perhaps shadow cancellation in tactics, but certainly no 'when revealed' or encounter deck manipulation.

Yeah, even though it got empowered in the HoN / AtS cycle, Tactics is still "not there" yet on par with the other three spheres. At least, a form of shadow control, albeit an indirect one, has started to show its face in the form of Gondorian Discipline and Close Call, as well as the spoiled Gondorian in the upcoming TLR. One can hope that this trend continues. The DT might be worried that giving Tactics raw shadow cancellation might seriously tip the balance in favor of the Tactics player vs the encounter deck in the combat department. Indirect shadow control is fine by me.

I can see tactics cancelling a when revealed, or forced effect from a non-unique enemy. Deflecting and and otherwise denying their foes the advantage fits well IMO.

I don't know if tactics deserves a 'when revealed' cancellation, but how about a surge cancel?  I think self-damaging effects would be a very nice sub-theme in the tactics sphere.  Erkenbrand introduced our first self-damaging ability, so far as I am aware; he is Leadership, but i think that mechanic would also fit nicely framed in Red.  Damage a character or hero you control to cancel a Surge effect, or Doomed, or to prevent put an ally that has just been discarded back into your hand or into play, that kind of thing.

Balance in games is not only misunderstood by many on a design level, but most of the comments in this thread do not even seam to take into account that this is a co-op game and a thematic one at that.

 

The spheres shouldn't be (and aren't) balanced and they hopefully never will be. As a co-op game we are forced to make sphere decisions based on that spheres specialities. This is how it should be. If you started putting cancels in tactics or card draw in or w/e it would massively alter the entire way the game plays.

 

Basically I read parts of this threads and what people are in fact saying is.. "I like X Sphere, I wish it did more so I didn't have to splash" which imo it kinda ridicules in a game that is totally focused on co-op.

I'm not upset that I have to splash. I'm upset that Spirit is the main splash because without it you don't have repeatable hero action advantage, "when revealed" cancellation, shadow cancellation, or surge cancellation. This has been shifting lately with Lore getting 2 new readying cards, soon to get encounter card cancellation, and Leadership got Heir of Mardil. Leadership and Lore have also had shadow cancellation in one form another, but Tactics remains the odd man out. It has pseudo shadow cancellation by having damage cancellation, but that only works on certain types of shadows and only if it can cancel enough damage.

I'm not asking for a power card. I'm asking for a situational card. The Door is Closed is a great example. It is by no means an auto-include, but it gives Lore some cancellation it never had before and that we sorely needed to see outside of Spirit. You need to build your deck specifically for it in order to make it worthwhile. Why can't Tactics do this? There combat experience can't be used to negate an enemy's ability?

I understand the opinion that we shouldnt be blending the spheres. I believe that, yet there have been advances toward a pseudo blending: Tactics has card draw with Legolas and readying with Rohan Warhorse. Lore has gained readying and cancellation. It goes on and on, but each of these blends fit into the flavor of their respective spheres. There's no reason we can't continue this to give Tactics SOME kind of cancellation.

As a side note, please remeber that this is discussion on opinions. I'm not trying to start a fight and I don't want to see belittling. We, as a community, must be better than that.

How about something like this:  

 

Shining Mail (tactics attachment) Cost: 3

 

Item. Armor.

 

Attach to a Rohan or (tactics) hero.  Restricted.  Limit one per hero.

 

Attached hero gets +2 Hit Points.  While attached hero is defending, Shining Mail gains: "Response: Discard Shining Mail to cancel a shadow effect just triggered."

i hope by the term "balanced" you mean "homogenized". Spheres should be "balanced" - in that they have approximately equal levels of power to affect the game in a positive manner and ensure victory.

 

Now, there might be certain quests that favor a particular color, and spheres should be better/worse at certain things in relation to one-another... But saying "things shouldn't be balanced" is rather silly.

 

Let's pretend that there are only two important parts to this game, Questing and Combat. It's very likely that Questing and Combat are not EQUALLY important in every quest and in every stage of the game.

 

If each compenent to the game has a particular coefficient based on how "important" it is, then each color should have a second coefficient that represents how good it performs that task.

 

For example, let's pretend that the game was actually extremely Combat-Orientated and there were only two parts to the game (obviously incorrect). 0.33*Questing + 0.67*Combat.

 

That means that two "balanced" spheres might have power coefficients of (3, 1) for Spirit and (1, 2) for Tactics. Even though Tactics is only twice-as-good as combat compared to Spirit, while Spirit is three-times-better than Tactics at questing, the actual strength of the two spheres are BALANCED.

 

Versus "homogenous" where each Sphere has very similar power-coefficients for every single major part of the game.

 

(Also, i do think it's sort of strange to say that Tactics doesn't actually have Shadow Card cancellation? Feint and Thicket of Spears. Sure, it doesn't work on Nightmare-Balrog or Sleeping Sentry on a Cave Bat, but...)

It goes on and on, but each of these blends fit into the flavor of their respective spheres. There's no reason we can't continue this to give Tactics SOME kind of cancellation.

 

Blending or repeated card effects are not intrinsically bad. Even "strictly inferior" cards are not a waste of cardboard. If there existed a different version of Test of Will that canceled a "when revealed" for 1 resource + 1 random discard, it would be worth running 3 copies of Test of Will + 3 copies of sh*tty Test of Will against certain quests.

 

This is even more-true when talking about different Sphere: In one-player mode, Dawn Take You All! is almost always a strictly inferior version of Hasty Stroke: it costs one more mana and only works on face-down shadow cards. (it can cancel "uncancellable" shadows like Nightmare Balrog, so it's not always strictly inferior).

 

However, DTYA! exists in a sphere with greater access to resource acceleration, and its cards are generally budgeted at a higher cost than other spheres. Shadow-Card cancellation is also a "tertiary" power-budget for Leadership. It puts has primary/secondary budgets for resource-acceleration, AoE buffing/debuffing effects and ally-mustering.

 

Anyway, the key part would be to give Tactics some sort of cancellation that fit its particular power-budget and themes. Giving them a Burning Brand would be rather inappropiate - espiecially in the context of Beregond.

 

Similarily, an Event might be a little abusable when it comes to Hama, since then you could have 6 "Feints" when combined with a good defending ally such as Defender of Rammas (though this would be less of a problem if it cost 2 resources).

 

A probably more-thematic way of doing it would be a 2/3 resource ally that had a Burning Brand effect. Maybe we could even work in the new Valour keyword which would probably work really well for Tactics anyway.

 

<3>

<0>

<1>

<2>

<2>

While <this card> is defending, cancel any shadow effects on cards dealt to the attacking enemy.

 

Valour Response: Discard <this card> to cancel the "when revealed" effects of a card that was just revealed from the encounter deck.

I wouldn't put both of those effects on a single ally. Also, I don't actually want something that cancels "when revealed" effects in essentially the same way that A Test of Will does. I'd probably aim the cancellation specifically at enemies in some way just because we are talking about Tactics. In any case, I think that if Tactics would have cancellation, it would sacrifice a character (like you did) or maybe a weapon attachment. I think discarding a weapon (or armor) attachment would be a great way to bring the power of the card down while still keeping it playable in many decks, though I'm not sure how you would justify it thematically.

I also believe that a shadow cancellation card that limits itself to only working on a defender with 2 or less defense or requires discarding an (armor?) attachment from the defending character offers similar balance.

Sure.

 

Part of that was just being a demonstration of how you can offer different tertiary abilities to spheres that also fit the theme of the decks...

 

A semi-squishy Burning Brand defender would make a good blocker against enemy adds since you prevent the occasional Sleeping Sentry from a 1-attack minion. And Tactics would usually want to Feint big attackers... Or use Beregond. But i feel like Beregond + Burning Brand might be a little much :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

A card that only worked on "When Revealed" effects on enemies, wouldn't really be that bad anyway, even if it wouldn't be useful for every single quest. There's some nasty When Revealed effects on enemies! Nightmare Ungoliant Spawn, Luitenant of Mordor...

What you don't seem to understand is that things are skewed too much in Spirit's favor. You could have a 4 player game with all mono-Spirit decks and it would likely do alright. If you play 4-player, you are practically required to have at least on player playing heavy Spirit, otherwise you wont stand a chance because you wont have the cancellation and location control you need. This is not healthy. If you still want to let Spirit specialize in those things, then give a sphere or two a weaker/more restricted means of dealing with some of these effects.

This has nothing to do with my favorite sphere. This has everything to do with more balance between spheres. I don't think that cancellation really needs to be a specialty of Spirit since there is nothing about "spirit" that says "cancellation" to me. If anything, Lore should specialize in cancellation.

I want to second Joezim007 in this and also, danpoage probably would. The latest episode of the Grey Company Podcast, which btw has an added bonus in the form of designer Matt Newman, Dan adresses this problem and they talk some time about multiplayer games too. He talked about his gaming group and in which he could predict by forehand if they were going to lose, just by seeing that there was nobody running Spirit or even only one person. They would get locationlocked or some treacheries slaughtered them off because there were too few A Test of Wills. Matt Newman said on the account of multiplayer games, that they are of course harder, but the players as a group do have more copies of A Test of Will between them. In that he did imply that it's almost impossible to win a 3 or 4 player game without 1 or 2 Spirit players, because they also design quests that way. 

 

Spirit has a monopoly which in my opinion should not be the case. Specializations are not bad imo, but monopolies are. Certainly, a sphere should excel in certain things, but not be the only sphere that can do stuff. Lore doesn't have the monopoly on carddraw either, but it does it very well. Cancellation should be the same.

They just need to make sure any non spirit cancellation is either restrictive enough or costed heavily enough to not encroach on spirit's niche.

To add more, there are a number of ways to do that. Obviously just making it cost a bunch of resources works. We have seen some supposition that an upcoming Lore card with obscured text and whose name escapes me may cancel things, as long as a copy exists in the Victory pile. This is neat, as not only does it make it worse then Spirit's options, it also plays in to the theme of Lore both manipulating the deck and victory display.

 

For tactics you could do some interesting things. A condition that built up tokens as you either successfully defended/attacked, or perhaps some cancellation that required you to search the deck for enemies with a certain hp value and engage them. Thematically representing tactics rushing in to the horde to stop a dangerous plot before it could hatch. Another possible one is obviously a Valour one, with additional restrictions, or one that can only be played while engaged with a certain number of enemies.

 

The only thing I want to avoid is neutral cancellation. If it ever exists, it'd better be mindbogglingly restrictive, as neutral cards are easier to include anywhere, pay for, and thus have a lot of inherent power.

It's all definitely a tough balance to keep the spheres from bleeding and each feeling unique but I definitely agree that each sphere should be able to do almost everything as long as it fits into that sphere (Tactics should do things via killing enemies or other martial actions). The main struggle with this game as I see it is that Spirit is the most important sphere with Tactics following close behind because being able to quest, cancel terrible treacheries and handle enemies is the core of surviving quests. Card draw, resource acceleration, readying and things from Lore and Leadership are all optional and can be very important but aren't as crucial as questing, combat and especially location control in 3-4 player.

 

So as it is, you actually do need Spirit for most quests where as you don't need Leadership or Lore and sometimes even Tactics. So if the other three spheres become as flexible and able to do everything as Spirit would that be good or bad? I think it would be good as long as it fits the sphere as we keep emphasizing.

Something that would be cool for Spirit Noldor is an attachment that allows you to lower threat whenever you kill an enemy.

Maybe something like:
 

2 cost (Spirit)

Unique

Attachment

Attach to a Noldor Hero. Whenever attached hero participates in an attack that destroys an enemy you may lower your threat by 1.

I don't even feel like Tactics is all that necessary anymore. Leadership has a lot of strong heroes and the ability to amass an army of allies, which can be as good or better than Tactics at combat.

And Spirit can now attack for 6 with two heroes, the event to quest kill a non-unique and old Elboreth Gilthoniel to throw an enemy on the bottom of the deck.

And yes Leadership is becoming able to deal with almost everything by amassing an army which seems suiting and cool.

So is it wrong for Tactics and Lore to be able to do everything also? I think this will be inevitable as the game grows. As long as the spheres still feel and play differently and have at least on strong weakness, Spirit not being able to handle bosses or high enemy quests, that should be good.

I think this is something Tactics should have, a way to lower threat by killing enemies which they are meant to do. This does not fit Spirit in my mind since they are not usually killing things.

I agree, but I also think this would be inappropriate for Tactics. Tactics should NOT be able to lower threat this consistently. Specifically this card is bad because

1) It only attaches to Noldor and there is only one Tactics Noldor hero

2) It is not restricted, so it doesn't prevent use from attaching Rohan Warhorse at all, which would mean we could use it twice a round

3) The one Noldor hero in Tactics has built in readying for even more chances to lower threat.

I would limit it by making it an event (but have it lower threat by 2 or 3) and I wouldn't limit it to a Noldor hero.

Also, I don't neccessarily think that Tactics should have ANY threat control. That seems like one of the things that really doesn't fit, but if it did get threat control like his, then they shouldn't ever get more than one card in their entire pool for it and it should be an event or discardable attachment. The discardable attachment would be wise so Hama can't recycle it.

Not sure why you think it has to be attached to Elladan..?

Changing the subject a bit...

But I was wondering, what does Ranger of Cardolan say? From what we can see, I think it definitely says "Response: After you engage an enemy..." and the rest is covered. But, we can also make out "hero" and "spend 1," so here's my guess:

"Response: After you engage an enemy, if you control a Ranger hero, spend 1 resource to put Ranger of Cardolan into play from your hand. If Ranger of Cardolan is still in play at the end of the phase, return it to your hand."

Maybe a little long, but I think it might fit. Also, the requirement to have a Ranger hero might be something else, like "Noble," or even something like "if you control a ready hero."

Just speculating. This cycle looks really good!

That seems like one of the things that really doesn't fit, but if it did get threat control like his, then they shouldn't ever get more than one card in their entire pool for it and it should be an event or discardable attachment. The discardable attachment would be wise so Hama can't recycle it.

You don't HAVE to, but he's the only in-sphere choice because it can only be attached to Noldor hero. In any case Elladan is a great example of why that attachment would be too strong for Tactics. Of course, you could a Limit to it by exhausting it or something, but even being able to use a Tactics card to lower your threat practically every turn is outrageous. Tactics should not have repeatable threat reduction

Interesting. I'd look more into it but I'm sick of spoiling all the cards for myself. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

brainstorming:

 

Well-laid Trap

Tactics event,  Cost: 2

 

Combat Action: Until the end of the phase, after an enemy dies, each player may reduce his threat by 1.

That should be cost X where X is the amount of players in the game in my opinion.
