So I watched a two-player game tonight and at one point there was a nasty enemy engaged with Player One and they were just getting pounded. Player Two felt powerless to help Player One. We all kind of agreed that it seemed strange that once that enemy is engaged there isn't much you can do in terms of peeling it off for some relief. Player Two didn't have enough ranged attack power to do enough damage to help.

But we were playing it correctly, right? Player Two can't choose to engage an enemy already engaged to Player One, right? Only enemies in the staging area can be optionally engaged?

I want to be able to tell them next week if we were playing it correctly and it was just a case of a bad beating.

You played it correctly.  There are some cards that can help the situation...A Light in the Dark,a spirit event that sends an engaged enemy back to the staging area and a leadership ally, Son of Arnor, that you can engage an engaged enemy when he enters play. 

One thing you may already know, keep in mind that you can play attachments on your partner to try to help them out. (though not allies)  Otherwise, range away and hope for Gandalf!

You could also have a character with the sentinel ability that would allow you to defend in their place.

Also, we always run copies of 'A Light in the Dark' as way to escape these kind of situations.

Thanks. I like to be able to give a definite answer on something when they ask. Next week we'll be ready. (famous last words)

your "ranged" characters can also join in when the other play attacks back at the enemy, potentially killing it off quicker.
