There was some talk on this thread: (http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=735700 [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=735700]) regarding the best way to attempt the Escape from Dol Guldur.

As discussed, I played "4-handed" and won, rather decisively.

No dead heros, over in 6 rounds. Only one "player" with a threat over 40.

Gotta say, if you have the mental energy - or the table space ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] - to play 4-handed, this seems to be the best way to go. I never got near even finishing Quest Card 2B while playing solo or 2-handed. As was my goal, I used only the Core Set cards, 3 heros and all their corresponding sphere cards per "hand".

If this quest is really kicking you in the teeth - as it was me - give this play style a shot. I lost my first try at it, but not by a lot. Second time round = victory!

Should be doable with 2-handed as well.

Already did the core cycle 2-player style on nightmare myselfgui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif] (which concludes with Escape from Dol Guldur)
