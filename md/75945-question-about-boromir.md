His Action says raise threat by 1 to ready Boromir. I came into an instance where I just had to kill a creature to win. Can i keep raising threat to ready and use him to attack or can i only do this once per turn.

only if you are not attacking the same creature. only 1 attack per turn on any 1 enemy is usually allowed (without card effects)

but you could raise threat to attack different enemies
