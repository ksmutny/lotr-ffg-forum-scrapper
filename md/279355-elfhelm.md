I am not native English speaker and I have troubles understanding Elfhelm hero [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Elfhelm-TotD]. Does a hero with two mounts get a +2?

No.

 * Each [sphere] hero with a Mount gets +1 [stat].

It's parsed like this: does this [sphere] hero have a Mount? Then he gets +1 [stat]. The actual number of Mounts is irrelevant—just whether there is (at least) one, or not.

(Of course, if the hero belongs to multiple spheres, e.g., Songs or an activated Amarthiúl, they get bonuses to multiple different stats.)

I think it's a shame that he doesn't boost Lore heroes with mounts.  They should really get +1 hp.

It escapes my reasoning why they did not such a thing, indeed

It's so much text you wouldn't be able to include flavor text! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I always thought that it was because Rohan has very little support in Lore.
