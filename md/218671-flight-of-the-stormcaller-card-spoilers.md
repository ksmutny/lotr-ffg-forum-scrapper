2 resources for one card is a pretty poor exchange rate.  Granted, it doesn't have a limit which will probably be abuseable.

Wow... Denethor let's you play Steward on the first turn if you draw it... and/or Gondorian shield also on the first turn! I really like him, should be a good defender in solo decks.

 

And dat Healer... woah... discard and 2 damages each round? yeah!

I prefer core Denethor, with Burning Brand he is a good defender and like his ability more. The new Leadership get the two resources bonus ok, bug i fo not find hkm tgst interesting.

On the other hand the Rod is s nice attachment since with Steward you can either get two resources or draw an extra card.

In the service of thd steward is a card i will probably never play.

Imladris Caregiver can be usefull especially in an Elrond deck

In Service of the Steward should combo well with Sword of Morthond in an Outlands deck.  Ally Gimli would do well with both on him.

In Service to the Steward is a great card when you want to use Gondorian Shield on a non Gondor hero and your playing multiplayer and someone else had the Steward.

2 neutral cards and one Tactics card makes me sad, but it seems like a pretty good Tactics card, especially with the Beorn ally... Swing back for 8 damage if you trigger his ability first. Boromir, Knight of Minas Tirith, Veteran of Isgiliath, and Veteran of Nanduhirion can all attack for 4 with their factions' respective buffs. Sadly, all of these allies are expensive, and any affordable allies swing for 2 or less... Though Silvan could make it work because they have the attack boost first turn, plus they cost one less, plus they like to leave play...

I'm really happy to see another good healer, and some decent secrecy support too.

Heed the Dream could be pretty awesome in multiplayer, and at least decent in one player of you want to get 1 card for one resource... But looking at top 5 certainly makes it worth it.

What I like about Denethor is that he is a great fit for Steward of Gondor. I think the cards here are great for Gondor decks, both mono-Leadership and multisphere. Tri-sphere especially becomes viable with Denethor's ability and the Steward. I'm thinking of something like Mablung, Damrod, Denethor.

 

Also, the card title for Rod of the Steward made me laugh.

I have to say, I really like Denethor - his ability to supercharge your start could be pretty amazing in the right deck, and his inherent resource smoothing, in combination with his low threat, means he is easy to fit in to a wide variety of deck types. It is also easy to boost his defense with the in-sphere Dunedain Warning, or obviously with Gondorian Shield if you have tactics. The fact that he is a perfect hero for Steward of Gondor is also a thematic win.

 

Rod of the Steward could be a good card - and card draw is something that leadership Gondor really needed - but it seems expensive. I'd probably be more impressed if this had come out before Elven Light.

## 23 [Seastan on April 29, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/218671-flight-of-the-stormcaller-card-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=2193478)

> In Service to the Steward is a great card when you want to use Gondorian Shield on a non Gondor hero and your playing multiplayer and someone else had the Steward.

 

Wouldn't Dunedain Warning + Gondorian shield provide the same benefit as In Service to the Steward + Gondorian shield? Only better, because you can attach multiple copies of Dunedain Warning and even move them around.

Last Stand goes by printed attack, sadly, so none of these bonuses matter.

They're just different cards.  In Service to the Steward of course lets you benefit from Visionary Leadership, the Boromir hero (this can go on allies), and For Gondor!  So yeah you could achieve the same defensive bonus with a different 2-card combo on a non-Gondor character, but if you're building a Gondor deck (which, often enough for me, contains non-Gondor heroes and allies), there's some reason to choose this card.

It would alone, but it's not strictly superior because this also would make the character a target for other Gondor attachments, or a recipient for Denethor's resource sharing.

 

I like Denethor's ability in combination with Heir of Mardil, to ready a noble target at the point wanted.  The Gondor noble heroes (the Faramirs, the Boromirs, Elanor and Imrahil) probably aren't as interesting to ready as the Noldor/Silvan that Arwen could do the same trick with, but Heir of Mardil is in-sphere for Denethor, and he may come by resources more easily than Arwen does cards.  (Though Elf-friend would enable more cool attachments than this one does.)

Of course having the Gondor trait has other uses. I was referring to Joe's comment that it's a great card to use Godorian Shield on a non-Gondor hero. If that's your goal, then I don't think it is.

Really like these leadership cards.

Gondor lacked card draw, now they have easy access to it. Should be easy enough to set up with Steward of Gondor, Gaining Strength, Gondorian Wealth etc.

Have been waiting for a leadership Denethor. I thought he might arrive in the saga. Good to see him at last though. His power for a good start is undeniable. His errand rider esq ability also seems very solid.

Gondor is getting love! This is a great day.

A point about Rod of the Steward: it's not limited in uses in any way. In many deck types resources have a habit of piling up in the late game, especially in Gondor if you're running blood or fire. Rod could help you dig for a late game answer. Whether that be a Feint or A Test of Will or whatever, it could really help close out games.

I really like Vanish from Sight. Being able to enter secrecy mode whenever you need it is very valuable. Sure, you need two heroes or less, but with the Strider attachment in a future AP, that doesn't seem that bad of a hindrance. Denethor is a nice hero. He's pretty much your banker. Cool stuff. In service of the Steward, I like this card as it allows you to splash non-gondor characters into a gondor deck. That just opens up the doors like elf-friend did. To me, that's always a good thing. :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

Not so keen on the healer. One card for 1 heal? Nah, I'll pass. Last Stand: why do you have to be restricted to only warriors!? Lame... Rod of the Steward. Ok I guess, seems costly though. But meh.

 

Honestly to me the stand out of the pack is Vanish from Sight. Now to wait for Strider.

This is a great pack. I'm still disappointed we got yet another 3 defense Leadership hero (after Erkenbrand and Amarthiul, c'mon! give us SOMETHING to use besides Sam!!) BUT, every other card of the pack is absolutely great, especially Rod of the Steward (no limits makes it so good in mono-leadership Gondor) So yeah, this pack is pretty **** awesome. And even if Denethor is not the Leadership hero I wanted, I still see how he can be good in a 2 or 3 sphere Gondor deck with Mablung or Damrod. I will look for some use for him, but in any case, the Rod of the Steward is the biggest piece Gondor has gotten in a while. Love it!

In Leadership, especially mono Leadership, and with no limit, this is amazing. If you dumped all your allies and have a pretty good boardstate but no cards, I'd gladly spend 2-6 resources to draw 1-3 cards, since Gondor can get them back pretty easily.

Quoted for truth. Just last night, playing a few games with my old mono-Leadership Gondor deck, running out of cards to play with countless resources available happened every single time. A draw engine would've been most welcome, even an expensive one.

> Wow...Heed the Dream is great.

 

Indeed. Amazing for setups and combo decks which need to find a particular card quickly. I'm predicting it will be a staple in many power-decks in the future.

 

Denethor is also great. Extra resources right from the start will always find a place in the best decks (let's you play Steward of Gondor or OHUH Gandalf in turn 1 without any extra help). His ability and starting threat of 8 makes him a direct contender with Théodred (Denethor - Arwen - Grima gives you an opening with 7 resources o_O). I'm wondering if Denethor's resource smoothing can make Heir of Mardil earn some more love as well.

 

None of the other cards (in the OP at least) are compelling though. Rod's Stewart is meh outside mono-leadership decks with a heavy resource generation. Guardian of Rivendell is too expensive for my taste (even for a Noldor deck, paying 3 and discarding 2 seems a lot), has no special ability and his stats seem non-optimally distributed. Imladris Caregiver and Last Stand are flat out bad. Last Stand is ridiculously situational and I'm guessing it won't be included in any deck any time soon (actually never).

 

Overall, when you consider Glorfindel ally is coming in this pack, him alone makes this AP a must-get. Nonetheless Heed the Dream is also a 5-stars card imo which should see a lot of play. Denethor is a cool hero. When is this arriving again? Can't wait to obtain it!

Hadn't thought about Denethor + Heir of Mardil. Thematic and awesome. I think he'll open up some great options for various decks, even if I'm not including him in mono-Leadership Gondor any time soon.

It should arrive to the States in about a week. For us, it'll probably be 1-2 months.

Vanish from Sight + Desperate Alliance combo for the win  :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Anyone saying the healer isn't great is dead wrong in my book.

First off with Elrond he heals 2. Secondly he doesn't exhaust like Warden of Healing so can quest and heal in the same turn.

Third he has two hit points so doesn't die to direct damage effects straight away. Fourth he gets boosted by Lords of The Eldar.

Finally in a Noldor deck his discard to heal is no drawback. Discard two Elven Lights (or lords of the Eldar or glorfindel ally) and then return them to hand to draw cards and to have them ready for more discard to heal. It gives way more flexibility to Elven Light too, late game if you really don't need Arwens resource boost you still have a great use for Elven Light.

I personally have been waiting for a card like this for a long long time.

Warden of Healing is possibly the most unthematic card in my decks and this new Noldor healer is going to instantly replace Warden in my decks. I do think I might have to include a third copy of lords and a little more card draw to the spirit/lore deck to make this healer truly shine and work a bit better but I am insanely excited and happy we got this card.

That's the reason why my most successful mono Leadership Gondor ran Balin for access to King Under the Mountain, and it worked great. Now that won't be necessary if I want to run a thematic Gondor deck. I really love this card.

Wow.

 

So I start with the only utter disappointment in the pack. The Last Stand card seems just utter awful. So, you need a Warrior and printed attack, that is just terrible. There just are no good candidates really. Gondorian Spearman could be one, but still, just one extra damage? If it at least was not printed, then Boromir could help, but this way? The printed really is a sucker there, else there could be a great combo with ally Beorn (after you Sneak him for the phase, for instance) against mighty foes who deal enough damage...

 

Now. The Lore and Leadership Noldor guys are great for hero Erestor decks, obviously. Especially if you have Narya (giving Leadership) there. The Leadership guy is really expensive but once there he has the fighting prowess of Gildor (exactly 2a, 3d, 3h). And the Healer is great in a deck for obvious reasons, just what was missing in a way from the discard deck: healing.

 

Absolutely love Denethor. Like how he has the same stats of the Lore counterpart, but since his ability has nothing to do with exhausting, you will free his defense, too. Being 8 threat, there might be a point of adding Staff of Lebethron as well. But I see him best with Boromir and Faramir (naturally). 5 resource to start with in such a deck is just amazing. I used to have Gondorian Wealth (which is not a very strong card) in the deck just to have a chance for 4, now 5 guarantee will turn things round big time. Fill it with allies, and whenever you get A Very Good Tale, there is a good chance to exhaust allies worth of 5 cost who can bring another 4 or 5 to play. Simply amazing set up boost. Imrahil is great but Leadership Denethor will have OP sayers screaming soon, I believe. Heir of Mardil will become much more reliable as well.

 

The Rod seems pretty good, but I will start with just 1 copy, I feel.

 

I am happy I had guessed the Leadership resources in Heed the Dream. The card seems superb, too. However, I do not side-board, so I will have to choose these double-colour cards carefully. What I like about them is that the initial ability seems perfectly playable on its own.

 

[edit] Re-reading the card, the funny thing is that the discard cost of the Guardian only applies when played from hand, so Elrond will send him guarding with Vilya "for free".

Yes. Really, there were still times, even in the late game, with my Erestor deck, when I did not have use for card that would be discarded at the end of the round. Having another option, and a **** strong at that, is excellent. Noldor discard decks have just got stronger, yet.

Why not? For the lack of Willpower? The mono-Leadership is all about allies anyway, and the two resources at start should easily compensate for 1 willpower on round 1. And as I said before, we are not going to see a 3 willpower Leadership Gondor hero, not ever I think. Yes, the start might still be problematic, in terms of questing, but with the new tools, getting to that state when you combo everything, should be considerably easier. I used to save Boromir as a safety cushion for defense even though I planned no attacks of my own. Well, now Denethor can play the role, freeing the 1 willpower (or 2 with Visionary Leadership) of Boromir's. And indeed, Heir of Mardil is now all but guarantee to trigger, and there are good options to choose from. Just a pity the card is unique...

 

Denethor solves another problem I sometimes used to have. Granted, ally Galadriel may not be the best card in such a deck, because the Leadership attachments are not so plentiful. The dilemma was always when I got her and Steward of Gondor on round 1, considering whether I should play her hoping for the Steward to be among the five cards (statistically not very probable but it did actually happen more than once) or play Steward first, then Galadriel and then rue that I have no attachments (beside the Steward) to choose from. With 5 resources, you can first play Galadriel and then Steward. Just a very minor point, I know, but I felt like mentioning.

Great pack!

Really like the new denethor.

I've seen some nice combos on this threat with him already, but him + Galdor = set up heaven.

Add steward, legacy of numenor, heed the dream, daeron's runes and cards like that and you're flying out the door!

His low threat makes him very splashable also with 3 defense :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Think he'll make his way into many decks, not only Gondor.

The rest of the cards are all good/great too!

There's not a single coaster in there I think.

In pure solo, the lack of a good early quester right from turn 1 can be problematic in a large number of quests. Since you'll ideally gonna run Boromir, that's 2 willpower between 2 heroes. If you want the willpower, you'll also run Aragorn for Sword that was Broken. That's a total 4 willpower between the heroes, which is a bit too little for me. You better pray for that Celebrían's Stone, but other than that, it takes time to build the necessary willpower with Visionary and whatnot to overcome the quest. That's the reason I want at least another 3 willpower Leadership hero, or maybe even better, just another lowish threat 2 willpower Leadership Gondor hero. With Visionary it shouldn't be too hard to get him to 3, and with Aragorn can quest at least for 5, which starts to become good. With Denethor it would mainly work in quests that give plenty of time like Conflict at the Carrock, but IMO it wouldn't in the aggresive new quests.

Well. Gotta try, hard to know without it, a typical deck-building mistake. I totally understand the importance of good printed stats, the 2 extra resources, however, work in a similar, allowing you to buy more round 1.

Heed the Dream has something I am not sure I get right.

You play the card, look for a card in top 5 and then if you spend 3 Leadership resource you can search your whole deck for a card? If this is the case then it csn be a very strong card especially with Leadership Denethor from turn one !

Quite niche, but Fresh Tracks could be played.

Or Grave Cairn, although presumably if you have a hero dying during setup, you've got bigger problems than using Denethor's ability.

I've beaten most (regular) quests with a LoDenethor/LeAragorn/Theodred solo deck, I don't see why a LeDenethor/LeBoromir/X Gondor deck would be at a particular disadvantage to that given 5 resources at start.  You don't need to pray for just Celebrian for a first turn +2 wp, you can afford Gimli or core Gandalf or Galadriel, or Visionary Leadership plus a 2-cost Gondor ally with a resource reserved, or Sword that was Broken if X is Aragorn, or Ingold with two resources on heroes, or ally Faramir if X isn't Faramir.  I did 25 random draws (no mulligans) from my private Gondor deck (still unplayed) at ringsdb, and every one of them generated *at least* 2 extra wp in attachments or allies, given 5 resources to play with.

No, there isn't, which is why JC's question above can only be answered with Response events. There are not a lot in Leadership, and by nature they are situational. (I checked neutrals too, and the only from-hand Response event? The End Comes, haha.)

Not really. In some of my Noldor decks I end up burning cards to Protector of Lorien in the Travel phase just so that I can draw more. So I think the Guardian or Arnor will have a good place in certain Noldor decks.

I don't believe the word "recycling" is the right one here when applied to Lords of the Eldar. "Enabling" would be a correct term here. And you just mentioned two spirit cards, which are not always going to be present in your hand. And then, the card is neutral, so we should evaluate it overall, not just for one sphere/archetype. The main comparison point for me is Rangr of Cardolan, which provides same stat total for just 1 more resource. Is +1 def -1 wp really worth the 2 cards from hand to 1 resource in cost exchange?

It is always better to be overly excited than the other way. I mean it is better to try and be proven worthless than not try and miss on a good card. I am really not sure about RotS, I hope it is good, I will play it for sure, but I cannot see using it more than a few times a game. I usually have cards to pay for in the deck. But since it is cost 0, it should surely be a potentially useful utility.

I've tried Rod of the Steward already, and I find it (after 2 games) useful consistently, but not dramatically game changing like some other card draw effects can be.  Gondor lacks card draw and this we know.  Sometimes I have games when the Steward of Gondor hero is just piled up with resources but no cards in hand to buy.  With the Rod, this doesn't happen anymore, but I've yet to see it net me more than 3 or 4 cards in a game.  Since the cost is so high, I'm really looking at this card as the most limited form of card draw, but it can help to prevent a deck from slowing down.  Previously Gondor had a kind of artificial full-stop brake system, where you would just be waiting for a windfall of cards (like drawing into a Sneak Attack + Gandalf) and had mountains of resources available.  This card fixes that, so now you don't really have the mountain of money, but also your deck does not grind to a halt because you keep the cards coming in.

 

A useful card, and I'll probably always include 3x when (and only when) I know I can use Steward of Gondor, and when my deck contains a lot of low cost cards.

I see it to be quite useful with ally Galadriel. You get to choose out of 4 or 5 cards, and you have a higher chance to get yourself the needed Sneak Attack or Gandalf, etc.

 

On a slightly related note, has anyone tried the new Sword with got in the previous adventure pack (I don't recall it off the top of my head)? That one seemed to me rather too situational as a resource acceleration (if you're not seeking attack boost), has anyone had luck with it?

> I don't believe the word "recycling" is the right one here when applied to Lords of the Eldar. "Enabling" would be the correct term here. And you just mentioned two spirit cards, which are not always going to be present in your hand. And then, the card is neutral, so we should evaluate it overall, not just for one sphere/archetype. The main comparison point for me is Rangr of Cardolan, which provides same stat total for just 1 more resource. Is +1 def -1 wp really worth the 2 cards from hand to 1 resource in cost exchange?

Don't forget Silver Harp. Can reduce it down to one card.

Here's a cool scenario. To the Sea in play and two copies of Silver Harp in play.

play the guardian for 2 by discarding a card and using to the sea, get that card back from one silver harp then get back one of the cards you had to discard to the Guardian with the other copy of silver harp. Only one card discarded and 2 resources spent. I know that there is a fair bit of setup but this could easily be achieved mid to late game.

I wouldn't run more than maybe 2 of these guys though.

Also no discard effect if played with vilya which is nice.

I've been using Sword of Numenor in this decklist http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/1094/two-and-a-half-gondorians-1.0 [http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/1094/two-and-a-half-gondorians-1.0] . It becomes quite good if you can get 2 copies on the one character. In a game of Journey Anduin yesterday the swords netted me 8 resources. Usually though they won't make quite so much. Obviously they're quite quest dependant. In a recent game of The Long Dark they netted me no resources because most of the enemies were goblins. Worst case scenario they're still 1 Attack for 1 resource. So fine to play providing you don't need the restricted slots for something more important.

Yeah, I think it is a reasonable design -- the Sword. It feels just about the right power: a combination of attack boost and potential resource acceleration. If you seek to strengthen the latter, however, it seems situational, just as you described. And the problem, for me is, that it is one of those attachments that makes most sense to have three of in a deck, to fulfill its potential.

I really like the Guardian of Rivendell and I'll be adding a couple copies to my Noldor discard deck. Since the deck focuses on getting Gildor with To the Sea!, this guy is kinda like a pre-paid version of Gildor, albeit without the Lore icon to wield Brand, but he has the same defensive stats and even is neutral, so he can be a good first round staller or a late game discard sink.

So, I have combo idea to use with Vanish from Sight.

 

Have Wandering Took and Song of Eärendil in play and have Loragorn. Might need Desperate Alliance if you are running three heroes.

 

Play Vanish from Sight during the Refresh Phase, making your effective threat stay at 20 for the rest of the phase.

 

Use Wandering Took to travel between all other players, constantly taking all their threat into your threat dial, but you still only are considered to have 20 threat, so you can't threat out.

 

Finally, once all other players have zero threat, activate Loragorn, returning your threat to your starting value, and leaving everyone else with zero threat. 

 

Will this combo work?

Yes, it should work.  Something will need to receive an errata, it looks like.  Honestly, it was only a matter of time before the Song of Earendil/Wandering Took combo could be abused to such a degree.

 

Edit: Just note that your starting threat would have to be 19 or lower in order for it to work.  I do not believe you can "Reduce" your threat to your starting threat if you are "treating your threat as if it is 20" and your starting threat is greater than 20.

[REDACTED lots of praise for jodudeit, some possible ideas for getting this to fire consistently with a mono-Lore companion deck, etc.]

 

I edit my post because now I'm not sure the combo works. Can you pay the cost of Wandering Took ("reduce your threat by 3 to..."), or for that matter, of Song of Earendil ("...raise your threat by 1...") while Vanish from Sight's effect is active?

I think you can pay the cost, because you would be adjusting the real threat, not the "as if" threat.  The alternative would be that while Vanish from Sight's effect is active, threat reduction cards would have no effect, and that threat increases from encounter cards or failed questing would have no effect.

I think it depends on what is meant by 'treat as if it were 20'.

 

If it's a filter on 'reads' of your threat (i.e. engagement checks, playing secrecy + pseudo-secrecy cards, checking for threat elimination level) then yes, you could perform the combo.

 

If it's a filter on both 'reads' and 'writes' (i.e. playing threat reduction cards) of your threat then you can't, as you wouldn't be able to raise or lower your threat at all.

 

Personally, I think it'll be the latter - if only to not allow this combo as it's pretty broken.

My thought for Vanish from Sight is that your threat dial and your considered threat are separate. Raising your threat with an effect means you increase your dial's value, and then after the effect is complete, you check your dial and any other effects to determine your considered threat. If that's the case, then the combo might work!

Yeah, I think this is the only way it can work, in which case it shouldn't matter if your starting threat is 19 or not as I previously mentioned.

Yeah, even if they say you can't play cards that would raise/lower your threat while this is active, what happens when the encounter deck tries to make you raise your threat?  It's broken either way.

 

I suspect we will be seeing "Limit once per round" on Wandering Took and/or Song of Earendil shortly...in order to accommodate the other interpretation.

Nice catch on this interaction!

I went through the rulebook and faq (like the most I guess) and it doesn't get very clear for me how this Card works (similiar to stand together when the core set was released). But I'd say it's obvious FFG will not allow this Combo to exist :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

First Thing: I don't think playing vanish from sight has an effect, if you are at 20 threat or below as it only has an effect if you are higher and the new faq states that Player Card effects are not recalculated after they are played, so you Play vanish, check the conditions (above 20), you don't meet them and nothing happens.

 

Second: You should be able to raise or lower your threat. Vanish just makes you treat it different. Example: Your threat is 35, you Play vanish and treat yout threat as 20. Now lower your threat by 5 and now treat your threat of 30 like a 20. I understand it like different People wearing the same costume: They are different people, but all look the same. Vanish doesn't change your "real" threat nor does it prevent it from changing, it just "Displays" a different number for game mechanics.

 

Third: I think you will loose if your threat becomes 50 or higher (at least I assume that's what FFG will rule as it doesn't Need any errata or reprinting if they just say: that's how the rules are). Why? Rulebook reads: If your threat Level reaches 50 you are eliminated. I'd say that both effects (vanish's after the Action is resolved and the one from the rulebook) are passive (always active) so they belong into the same category of effect Resolution, but because the Elimination rule uses "if", while vanish has no such word and should therefore be resolved first loosing you the game.

 

I am no native english Speaker and this discussion is heavily based on wording I would say and I think is is especially argueable, if the "if" from the rulebook makes a difference (what is the only reason I could think of why the Combo should not work). I guess you could argue that the elemination rule is more of a forced effect, so it should always be checked after appliing vanish's effect.

Even if I see the interaction completly wrong, I am sure FFG will do everything they Need to prevent this Combo (like a day-1 Errata).

 

 

Edit: Just imagine they Reprint vanish to prevent this from Happening and recall all released stormcaller APs. We would have to wait so much longer :S

I see no reason why you would not be able to modify your threat when it is being "treated as 20" under the effect of Vanish from Sight. 

 

Possible parallel here, but if you have a "treat text block as blank" effect on a character, you can still gain Ranged or Sentinel via card effects like Arwen or Dunedain Cache (previously confirmed by dev).  Which is kind of like "writing" to a text box that is "treated as blank."

Hi!

 

The following is a possible interaction of the various rules:

 

The card Vanish From Sight creates a lasting effect, and as such the effect is not recalculated (per 1.55 rule clarification in FAQ).

 

In other words, your threat cannot be reduced (which is a cost you must pay for the effect of Wandering Took to resolve, and thus you cannot initiate his triggered ability).

So a character's text box is essentially a repository for traits and keywords to be 'written' into? Interesting, not thought of it like that before.

 

The gaining of ranged or sentinel seems a bit odd given the recent rulings on lasting effects, where encounter card effects have to be recalculated whenever the game state changes. Unless that only happens when the encounter card says "printed text box" (e.g. Shadow of Fear [http://hallofbeorn.com/cards/Details/Shadow-of-Fear-RD]) rather than just "text box" (e.g. Shelob's Poison [http://hallofbeorn.com/cards/Details/Shelobs-Poison-TLoS])?

Arwen and Dunedain Signal don't alter the text box, they simply say the character "gains sentinel".  Whether the text box lacks sentinel because of an encounter effect or because it never had it in the first place hardly matters.

This A imply B logic... you got A, B, but this A=>B, I don't know where you get it...

For me, "consider" is like a tracing-paper. You still move your threat dial as your threat is modified, but you only get to see the number "20".

I'm afraid that Calvadur will be right, that it will be ruled like reaching 50 on your dial will still eliminate you... but that would be just a bad strategy to prevent the combo.

 

 

I'm still amazed about how game developper/designer (other?) fail to see when they introduce such cards. Rod of the Steward IS a potential breach for a loop combo. Either you got an action that has no limit and alter the game state without much loss, or you got a response that has no limit and alter the game state without much loss. That's why a lot of card got errated, and things like Wandering Took, Rod of the Steward, Love of Tales, Durin's Legacy and the likes should not have been printed like that. Those are too close of making loop. I don't have any idea, for now, how to abuse the Rod, but we will, it's just a matter of time... or card...

At least, all the Noldor Card were really well made, I was very afraid with all this discard interactions, but they were well made.
