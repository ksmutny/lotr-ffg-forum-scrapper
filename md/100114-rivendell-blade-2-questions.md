Rivendell Blade's superpower reads like this:

 

When attached character attacks an enemy, that enemy gets -2 Defense until the end of the phase.

 

1) Can the target enemy's Defense rating drop into the negatives, or is "0" the rock bottom?

 

2) Can multiple characters with R.B. stack these "-2 defense" to really drop the pants off an enemy when they gang attack?

defense can't go below 0, but you can certainly stack -2 defense onto an enemy that has more than 2 defense.  You can even have 2 Rivendell Blades on the same character (Legolas loves it!).  but only 2, of course, and no other weapons in that case, since it is a Restricted attachment.

Yes he does! And Hands upon the bow and sometimes even Support of eagles... which isn't restricted :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

I love me some Legolas with Rivendell Blade and Support of the Eagles! Plus Rohan Warhorse when I get Voice of Isengard.

I can't wait to use hands on the bow to destroy an enemy in the staging area with Legolas only to ready him with the Warhorse and then destroy another sucka during combat!
