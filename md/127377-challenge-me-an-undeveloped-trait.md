My card design hunger grew once more and is in a dire need to be sated.

 

I would like anybody to name a trait, an undeveloped one, but existing, a faction trait(Rohan=faction;Scout=not a faction). And I will try my best to develop some stuff around it. Thanks.

> Wose.

You know, I would totally love to toy around with this trait. And I tried in the past, but there is one HUGE problem I stumbled upon - total and utter lack of Wose art of any kind. If someone knows where Wose art from the encounter cards can be found - I would much appreciate that.

Rough sketches of the Dale guys. We currently have two 3-costed Dale allies, one from Lore and one from Spirit, both doing something about locations or involving locations. I wanted to keep that theme, finishing the sphere loop:

Converting damage into the progress? Currently, "thematically speaking", he's using the land advantage he gathered (progress tokens) to make unexpected strikes (pure damage avoiding defense and stuff).

 

Also, how could I forgot the glorious neutral sphere?!

I like them all, but I love the tradeoff with Lonely Mountain Watch. It can actually be very beneficial in quests where you need time to build up so you don't want to explore things too quickly. It'd be super awesome if it was a normal action instead of a Combat Action. I guess we can't have our cake and eat it too, eh?

Being able to eliminate enemies from the staging area during the quest phase (and before questing resolves) would prove too strong for this kind of card.

## 20 [joezim007 on November 19, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/127377-challenge-me-an-undeveloped-trait/?do=findComment&comment=1339293)

I agree, but that doesn't mean it wouldn't be awesome. If we made it a regular action, we could limit it to 1 damage and then even if you had 3 of them out, you wouldn't be able to take out many of the enemies out there and even if you did take out an enemy it would require you to have 3 tokens on the location and you would need to exhaust 3 allies.

Nice work! I'd totally use Lonely Mountain Watch.

 

But I also use Outlands, Spirit Glorfindel, and Dain. So take my viewpoints on broken cards with salt...

Isengard. Good mechanics but too few cards to play them... new doom allies didn't even have Isengard trait. And so little to gain from. I would like to see more "when something bad happen" trigger and more "something bad" tradeoff that comes with.

A-a-and here goes the Dunland, wrath of Wild Men turned the right course. They still hate the cards, but now you're benefiting from it instead of suffering. What I tried to do is to create a trait faction that has a distinctive theme, but is not tied to each other directly, so they could be used effectively as stand alone cards.

Nice, could totally expand this further.

Really love the lore and spirit ally most of all, the witch of the wild men would be better with "Choose one that you didn't choose already this turn", or it will be mostly included for drawing cards in non-dunland deck and dunland deck would have very few bonus of using it.

By "another" it means that she can't target herself with that ability. And your interpretation wouldn't be possible as this ability is once per turn.

I really like the idea of these Dunland guys, however with the Dunland Chief hero it's entirely possible that you may not have to discard a card for 2-3 turns in some cases, so he'll be under performing a little during these instances?  Maybe give him a Refresh action ability like Erestors?

 

The Dunland allies obviously facilitate getting cards into the discard pile but you're making them very dependent on the setup of the other heroes (2 of the same sphere) with the Chief and drawing into the right Dunland ally on the first turn?

 

Also there's a little typo in the Chief's card (tompost).  Great reversal of the card hate theme though

He certainly could. A price to pay for being able to acquire a printed resource icon of a desired sphere. Plus, his starting threat is kinda low, so you could "lay low" for some time more easily. He already has too much text to add anything else.

 

I'd say that they're more about getting cards out of hand than into hte discard pile :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

I totally see them being played without the Dunland hero himself. And the hero without his fellow tribesmen.

I was talking about choosing more than one effect, but only one of each effect, thus removing the limit 1 per round.

> Yeah, that´s true, but I mean what it´s about. You probably want him for his attaafck when you look at him. No offence, it was just a thought out loud.

Yep, you'd totally want him for his attack, but for his cost - giving him 3 attack out of the box would be way too much, so I tried to compensate his buildup with generic spirit thingy - willpower. Something for him to do while he is being "motivated" :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

> I would like to see some Haradrim/Umbar mercenaries.

The only references to Umbar in the game that we currently have (if I recall correct), are Umbar Assassin and The Hand of Castamir. Harad has quite a set of enemies, but I do not catch any distinct theme among them. Archery and attacking right away from staging area, perhaps, but I'm not sure how to transit those things freshly into the player cards, because both direct damage and attacking the staging area are currently pretty developed things. I'll have a big thought about it.

 

> Amazing Dunland allies! Would totally use them. The only thing I didn't like much was the generic "Dunnish Chief" hero. I would've chosen some name and go with that.

I'm not very good with names. Especially lore related ones, because I have no knowledge of it.

Dwarf make profit of discarded and discarding cards (somewhat), Isengard for raising threat, Rohan when losing character, Dunedain when engaging enemies.

The closest we have to a Dunlending name is Freca, who was a Rohirrim lord with mixed Rohirrim and Dunlending blood, but Freca sounds very Germanic/Anglo-saxon, closer to Rohan than Dunland, if we take the Dunlending race as analogue to Celts, which this game seems to do. However, some real-life ancient Celtic names we could use are Nechtan, Drest, Eogan and Dúngal, all male. Maybe you could transform some of them to make them some more unique.

Dunland Chief's ability is ambiguous. Do you count the cards in your hand BEFORE you draw the normal card during the resource phase or AFTER you've drawn it. It should be a response:

Response: After drawing a card during the resource phase, if you have 2 or fewer cards in your hand, draw an additional card.

or

Response: After the refresh phase, if you have 2 or fewer cards in your hand, draw a card.

----

Also, Dunland Raiders should say "round", not "turn".

----

I love this card set. I really want to try it out to see how well it works in practice. I hate the idea of having to discard cards all the time, but it's definitely a cohesive and functional faction theme.

Now... where are those Woodman cards?!?!?

Witch of the Wild Men should probably be fixed to only trigger when you discard a card from your hand, otherwise there are a ton of cards that discard themselves from play or discard cards from the top of the deck, and this card stops being so related to the Dunland faction.

Even if you did make this fix, she would be pretty awesome in any decks that features Eowyn, Protector of Lorien, Daeron's Runes, and Erestor. It might even get Erestor into more decks. It's interesting, though, to see such a powerful card draw engine being made up of a Leadership card and a Neutral card. Of course, it's an expensive card draw engine, but we're talking about Leadership here.

## 41 [MyNeighbourTrololo on November 19, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/127377-challenge-me-an-undeveloped-trait/?do=findComment&comment=1340042)

Yeah, I missed that "from your hand" wording. The Witch was made to synergize with Dunland guys, but to be good without em too.

> What do you feel is more balanced?

Well, we are talking about a hero ability, so I think we should use the stronger one. If Bilbo can get an extra card each round, why can't we let this guy have more of a chance to do so?

Now, with all this discarding, we need a Dunland way of retrieving/using cards in the discard pile as well. That would definitely make this faction stronger. Maybe make an attachment that exhausts to allow you to swap any card in your hand with a card with the Dunland trait in the discard pile. Or maybe make an event that allows you to play a card in the discard pile as if it was in your hand.

Dunland Raider's ability happens MAYBE 3 times per game. Also, if you're paying 2 resources for him, then you are less likely to be able to have a card discarded that round before he comes into play. I'd like something easier to use and maybe repeatable. Of course, if it's repeatable, we need to limit its applicability, which is why I said it can only grab cards with the Dunland trait.

Would like to see some attachments or events with the Dunland trait. Something with the Wildery, Savage or Ravage Event trait. With actions to discard cards and then some cool benefit or just plain discarding. 

Action: Discard two cards from your hand. 

The responses that would then trigger could be seen as benefit. 

Some Dunland Mounts would be cool. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] Wargs tamed! :o [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_ohmy.png] That would be awesome!

Well, you told us to challenge you, so you should come up with somehing. In any case, they should be similarto Beornings (they lived close to each other) but that doesn't really help because they really don't have any cohesive theme.

The only things I really know about them, aside from their proximity to Beornings are that they lived in forests and were "brave" (according to a qoute from The Hobbit).

Sounds to me like they should be mostly based off of location management (with special boosts in forests maybe) and also either high willpower or high combat prowess to represent their bravery. If you can somehow blend location management and combat prowess (kinda like Lonely Mountain Watch), that would be awesome!

- "if you have a hero in your discard pile"

- "for each xxx in the staging area"

I was afraid someone would say that :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

As for the woodmen - challenge accepted. I have something brewing.

Here is my small take on Woodsmen:

 

Exploring X Keyword

Exploring is a keyword I developed to represent the overall Woodsmen theme. Any (even ally) card with the Exploring keyword can be played as a response to a location leaving play as an explored location, When played that way, the cost of the card is reduced by the X value.

Like these cards, especially the Veteran. Signs of Nature seems a bit strong though, perhaps if it could be limited to one copy per deck?

 

Question: when the Outfitter's reaction triggers, a player would be able to play the attachment straight away, right?

Good work.  Sad Rivendell Minstrel is sad.

Beard-Trimmer doesn't really seem to fit the Spirit sphere. I know you're trying to keep them all in Spirit or Lore, but if you moved a stat point to attack and made her Tactics, she might fit in better. Then again, the whole Exploring keyword doesn't fit too well into Tactics, but w/e.
