 The rule book as no specific setup instructions for decks, only that playing with more than 2 players involves a second copy of the core set.

What's the setup?  Combine all the cards mentioned for the encounter deck (IE both copies of the cards mentioned)?

Also I have two different 1A cards for passage to mirkwood.  Do I play both for the first scenario or do I choose one and omit the other?

Hi

The Encounter Deck Setup is the same for 4 players as for 2 players. You don't need any additional cards from the second core set (that's only for player cards and threat trackers). You just reveal one card for each player  from the encounter deck each quest phase. (Yes, it gets easier with more players)

You should have 2 3A/3B cards for passage through mirkwood "Don't leave the path" & "Beorn's Path", and only one 1A card.

 Thanks for the help mate!

Yes, I meant 2 -3A/3B cards.  However, do i use both or choose one to play with?  >.>

Include both and just play through the quest from 1A...all will be revealed
