-At stages 3 we encounter the Lieutenant of Angmar, which jumps between stages. If we kill him, everybody wins the game.

Thanks for posting this!  I've been trying to re-read the article for all pertinent information that could aid in my deck building for Gen Con.  I'm still trying to sort out what decks I want to bring.  I feel like any deck in this quest will likely need to be combat ready, but questing also appears to be important to trigger the various effects at the different stages.

 

Has anyone had any thoughts on how the information in this article could benefit deck building preparation for Gen Con?

I don't think there's shared Victory Display so Rossiel crazy shenanigans wouldn't work. Nor Scorpagorn's engagement tricks. But with the pressing need to eliminate the Hosts quickly, maybe a Dunhere or a Ranger Trap deck per stage seems appropriate.

Edit: nevermind. Immune to player card effects, because of course. Screw it, I'm going Elrond Outlands.

The rules cards have reminder text for Archery, but not for Siege / Battle / Defense. So we should be willpower questing.

I thought about going with traps too - the hosts are immune to player card effects, but if you can trap other enemies, you might be able to deal with the hosts more effectively.  Of course, there's the thing though about putting damage on the city for each enemy, which means you can't just trap enemies and forget about them - so maybe traps wouldn't be as helpful after all as just focusing on killing them.

 

I'm bringing at least a Silvan deck and a Noldor Erestor/Cirdan deck with big, beefy allies.  I'll be playing on Sunday.  Still thinking about whether I want to throw together another deck or two as backups in case the heroes I'm relying on are popular.  Maybe a straight tactics deck.

I won't be at GenCon but want to find a Fellowship event in Denver. My Rossiel/Mirlonde deck has Glorfindel just for solo questing and location management, but I can swap him out for any low-threat Spirit hero.

Thinking about the Lieutenant Guy, I wonder what his effect exactly is. If it happens too few, then the boss battle will be a joke and you just kill him there with a fired up Boromir. If it happens too much, then the boss battle will be tedious since he jumps from one stage to another(remember the wargs!).

The Wizard's Chest in Denver may have one again this year.  They have an impressive stock of LOTR cards.  I'm told they have a pretty solid player base, too.

They're in the process of relocating. Hope they'll be done by then and have a closer location for me! How does one sign up through them?

Just call the store and ask about it.  It may be a little early to sign up, but you can at least express interest and make sure they submit an application to host the event.

Has someone played this mode at GenCon? Where do i discard the Hosts after they damage the city?

Have asked Caleb .. there is no shared Victory Display. Each team has its own VD.

Probably discarded in stage A/B's discard pile.

mmm.. i don't think so. If the Host goes out of play there is a permanent flow of Hosts .. only one per staging area.

With the discard-effect the flow can/will stop and then 2F can draw 2+ Hosts via staging.. then Sauron will laugh and the players will die.

What I know about Siege of Annúminas, having now played it, is that it's friggin' hard in epic multiplayer mode... Good luck and godspeed to those who still have their Fellowships to attend!

Attended the event yesterday, got absolutely crushed in both modes (yes we played it twice), and I am playing my best generic deck. Unfortunately no one in my group brought a location clearing deck... The consensus is to throw in all copies of Northern Tracker and go to it again.

Except that location that blocks Tracker and Asfaloth. We were killed by the one that scales horrifically with more enemies in play, so 2 of those with 7 threat each basically cancelled out our Spirit player.

By the way, I'm not really interested in keeping that playmat nor alt art Faramir. Do those sell well or they too widely distributed to make a splash on Geekmarket or eBay?

My sense is that both the playmat and the Faramir card should sell well.

Traditionally, they sell very well. With how many sets Wizard's was able to get this year, it might be the case that the market is more flooded this time around.

 

Great to throw down with you on Friday! Going to fully revamp my contribution for the event on the 29th up here in Fort Collins. Going to focus on questing like a beast, hopefully keep space to retain the healing element and add a location control element.

Played it twice in epic multiplayer mode.  We lost badly the first time.  The treachery that blanks out text boxes neutered our attackers and we couldn't clear enemies.  Changed decks, and the next time we played 'easy mode,' although there are not actually gold-bordered cards to remove from the deck, so we just started with an extra resource per hero.  So, 'sleazy mode,' as it is called in some circles.  We won handily the second time.

Epic victory against "Siege" today at our Fellowship Event in the VA/MD/DC area. Multiple New Age Outlands decks (1 Outlands was straight mono-leadership/Gondor [Denethor, Leadership Imrahil, Hirluin], the other Erestor-based [Erestor, Denethor, Hirluin]) and two Dwarf decks did the heavy lifting. Outland decks were supported by an Elrond deck each for healing and utility (Thror's Map, cancellation, card draw/deck search). Dwarves were all in their own staging area (E). Two players only at each stage also certainly helped reduce the amount of Encounter deck awfulness coming out.

I'd love to see what heroes those teams were running.  

 

We had 4 per team, and in both attempts we lost at either the 5th or 6th turn.  Generally due to threat-ing out in questing.  Those locations with X threat were terrible.  Blanking wounded characters was terrible.  And forcing all of us to engage enemies was terrible.    It was a blast though!

I did have a rules question - is there only 1 victory display for the entire team of 12 players - or is it still unique per group?

I do notice you had Eleanor on each team.  I decided that was critical as well, but only after our two games of getting slaughtered.

His entry was incomplete, so I was just going off of memory. (EDIT: Checked the photos on Facebook; his other two were Legolas and Lanwyn).

 

Eleanor and Eowyn are both extremely useful in 4 player games (I hear free cancellation and getting up to +4 WP are good).

I figured as much on Beregond. Just thought it was funny.   I still haven't used Lanwyn yet.  How did she do?   Would Glorfindel been a better choice since he can get ranged easily and is a better target for excess Tactics weapons after you gear up Legolas?

 

I wish we had been able to coordinate better to get setup like you did.  The other people signed up for the event outside of my usual play group just never took the time to organize.  So while we all did seem to have strong decks and performed well, it definitely wasn't well enough and in each case I think having Eleanor on the board for each team would have easily made it much more manageable.  

 

I'm hoping to get another group together sometime in the next few weeks to give this a shot again, but with a bit more coordination in decks.

 

 

Was there any tech in particular (or strategy) that you included for a particular stage?   Such as, any cards you specifically included in one team but didn't require it in the others?  Or was there any strategy into which team took which position?

I didn't get a chance to see Lanwyn in action; in fact I suspect she saw little use except for questing. I might have went with Glorfindel, but I think the deck with Arwen had dibs on LoV.

 

Tables A/B and C/D weren't as tightly coordinated as E/F. In fact, E/F were this Tactigorn deck [http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/3608/anger-management-a-day-of-wrath-1.0] and this Brand son of Bain deck [http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/3607/raisin-brand-2-scoops-of-death-1.0]. This table was strongly focused on killing everything and adding progress using Blade of Gondolin, which is a good strategy for every table.

 

None of the other tables had a table-wide cohesive strategy, the eight of us just brought our strongest possible decks.

> I did have a rules question - is there only 1 victory display for the entire team of 12 players - or is it still unique per group?

Every group has its own victory display

Our stage (E/F) used a very specific strategy which can be read about here: http://ringsdb.com/fellowship/view/1600/annuminas-stage-e-f [http://ringsdb.com/fellowship/view/1600/annuminas-stage-e-f]

That is an awesome strategy. Thanks for sharing!
