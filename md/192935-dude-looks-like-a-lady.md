Got my pack last night and since I had already seen the cards over at cgdb I decided to read the rule sheet first. This time it included the back story of Amarthuil and I read that too. Then I went and looked at the player cards in more detail. When I got to Amarthuil I stopped confused. "Wait, what?" And I went back to Amarthuil's story again. "Nope. Amarthuil is supposed to be a guy."

So I flipped the card to my wife, who doesn't play, and asked, "Man or woman?"

"Woman. She has b@@bs. And the hips and thighs too."

When you get your cards let me know what you think. I'm starting to wonder about real backstory of Amarthuil. (In development I mean.) Was the three hit points because he was a she?

Hmm. Just zooming in on the art I can see it. The objective ally versions look more male, but the hero definitely does have a feminine look.

Great. I already have enough problems correcting everyone who calls Elrohir a she.

I had the same thought when I first saw the spoilers.  Maybe it's just really bulky northern clothes with a belt that gives it an hourglass shape?

First transwoman of LotR confirmed?

Actually Eowyn in disguise! Always has been.

I don't think transwoman is the proper term. I think it would be transman. Right?

My wife keeps referring to Gleowine from the Core set as "she." Now it's just a running joke.

Correct! Amarthiul will now forever be a trans man in my own personal headcanon. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Whether or not it was the artist's intention, his figure does look kinda womanly, but I still think the art is badass. Kind of ambivalent towards the dual wielding theme but the pose and background are cool.

This makes me sad... I could already tell the art was really sub par (mainly the face..) from the cardgamedb images plus the original person who spoiled him for us said he looks like Aria Stark but I didn't want to make any judgement until I saw the proper full art. Sounds like I don't really need to see the full art though..

 

Also is it just me or does it just look like a zoomed in female version of Halbarad.... 

Similar hair, same double sword wielding pose, similar clothing etc..

 

is this the worst hero art we've gotten?

 

> Great. I already have enough problems correcting everyone who calls Elrohir a she.

This is insane. who are these people! Elrohir and Elladan definitely have gorgeous art but are clearly masculine!

Male-to-Female transitioned people are usually called transwomen. 

 

Calling t-girl a man would seriously offend her.

One of my partners already thinks that Gleowine, Haldir [Ally], Gildor, and Glorfindel are all female anyway... And Northern Tracker too, although that's more ambiguous, but I think it's got facial hair so is probably a man.

But Gleowine has a beard...

Amarthuil hero art looks like Arya in Game of Thrones (TV serie).

Amarthiul is clearly male as he's always referred to as a man. Thus the assumption would be that he is female-to-male transitioned, not mtf.

Male can be his birth gender, yet he tries to look like a girl, hence he's an mtf.

...or he was afab, hence him still looking feminine because that's the nature of the body he was born with, but he identifies as male (Hence everything referring to him as male), thus he's ftm.

Everything is referring to him as male because old people are ignorant and refuse to percieve him as a female he wishes to be, hence he's an mtf. Stop arguing.

"Stop arguing." Truly your grasp of rhetoric is staggering. This whole argument is pretty dumb to begin with since I'm pretty sure the designers didn't intend Amarthiul to be trans in either direction, but between the two options in this hypothetical I personally feel the option wherein every other character and the impartial narration written by the designers aren't ignorant and bigoted is the preferable one.

Not to mention it's pretty weird that you're arguing so vehemently for him being female while still referring to him as male and thus lumping yourself in with the very ignorant old people you're condemning.

Exactly the reason you should stop arguing. I can't because of my OCD. Be above me.

 

I call him "he" because it's obviously an misleading art and it has nothing to do with any sort of gender identification.

Hahahah this discussion is worth nothing. Also, PW, I don't think John was serious with his 'stop arguing'.. Because both sides could be true, it depends on perspective. John saw this I guess, and jokingly said that. It a 'welles/nietes' as we call that; a yes/no game..

He is obviously ment to be a guy.
