We are still missing Balin and Oin, but Bofur got a second ally card already.

A 2-willpower Tactics ally? I'm so happy happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]

Also, Beorn is awesome. Not incredibly "good" at first glance, but awesome. Ori is nuts.

"You’ll steer the fates of Bilbo Baggins, Thorin Oakenshield, the wizard Gandalf, and other familiar characters as they begin their journey out of the Shire. You’ll encounter terrible trolls, bitter storms, rampaging giants, swarms of Goblins, and the strange creature known as Gollum. You’ll meet new Dwarves, burgle treasures, and answer riddles in a deadly test of wits. With three scenarios drawn directly from the first half of the novel, five new heroes, treasure cards, and three copies of each player card, The Hobbit: Over Hill and Under Hill brings you as close as you can get to reliving this classic work of fiction without finding your name on the page."

that was the closest i could find in the articles.

 I missed the part about "immune to player card effects" on Beorn.  So no armor or healing, 1 defense, and only 10 hit points.  That's not a lot really.  I know that Elrohir has been given a LOT more than 20 points cumulative damage in some of my games.

So you are in Florida?  I am curious as to if you got it early due to some involvement with FFG or GenCon or if your local store actually had it for sale already?

Thanks Hastur!!! You're the man. It's been a long wait but getting two packs so quickly is awesome.

Beorn is the sickness.

My question is: what advertisement is on the back of the rules page? Is there any clue about upcoming products?

Don't know about you, but I'm dissapointed.

Not only 4 from 5 heroes are boring dwarves, but new cards are sort of meh…

Really? A hero immune to player card effects? With 1 def, 10 hp and not exhausting to defend? Great, now we have the men to fend off all those nasty crows and bats! And not really anything else.

while i can understand your disappointment, it is The Hobbit after all. It's about the adventures of 1 Hobbit, the occasional Wizard, and…13 dwarves. In reality, nothing else should have been expected - this is a "saga" expansion that is meant to recreate the feel of the book; i.e. it's purpose is to allow us to play the story line of the book. frankly, you could argue beorn shouldn't even be a hero, as he's a minor portion of the novel. but, since we've obviously can't have 13 dwarf heroes, they are trying to branch out a bit; i don't think that's a disappointment, i think that's a great thing!

I'm sure the second box will give us a hero from Lake town, maybe the lord of the eagles, wood-elves, etc…but given that 13 of 15 main characters in the book are a dwarf…lol. I just don't get any surprise/disappointment by anyone that the bulk of the cards would be dwarven. It might have been smarter to not do a dwarven cycle followed by the Hobbit, but, it's what FFG did.

after that, since we've been to Moria and now the Hobbit, I doubt we can expect many more dwarf heroes in the future.

Thanks for the spoilers.

Do the rules explain what "immune to player card effects" actually means? Can a healer remove wound tokens on Beorn, after all you are affecting the tokens, not Beorn. Can you play Fate or Fortune on him in the discard pile? Can he be "saved" with Landroval?

Some answers.

No there is no advertisement on the back of the rules pamphlet. You get two deck lists that are made from the core set and hobbit expansion only.

I played the first quest last night, We Must Away, Ere Break of Day. It was a bust on my first attempt as it is one of those take your time on the beginning part of the quest or things will get incredibly hard scenarios. The flavor of the quest was fun but I did beat it my second time through after I delayed a bit on pushing forwards through the first part.  I used my all dwarf deck on the scenario and did fine. You can find my all dwarf deck here [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/index.php?/blog/34/entry-143-deck-6-khazad-ai-menu-lotr-lcg/].

Also, sorry to be the one to say it, but, I agree that it is a little dissapointing. I mean, am I the only one who finds the player card pool a bit… lacking? Sure, it's 3 copies of each card, but to me only 4 cards for each sphere is too few. Way too few.

unfortunatly no store within around 200 miles….i preorder my packs about 3 months ahead of time as i usually dont have money at the time of release, so its either wait a long time with a guarantee of getting it, or gamble on having money to buy it at the time

either way i will consider an over seas purchase next time

That´s one card more than we got in Khazad Dum. And considering this is more or less a special deluxe expansion…..what were you expecting?

Its 16 cards per sphere. The core set had 30 cards per sphere. So seems not too bad.

That´s on card more than we got in Khazad Dum. And considering this is more or less a special deluxe expansion…..what were you expecting?

Its 16 cards per sphere. The core set had 30 cards per sphere. So seems not that bad.



exactly. the product's not even in our hot little hands yet and there has to be a critic in the crowd. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

The store I work for received our shipments today. I opened my copy to take a peek and share.

 

 

ha! my store hasnt even got shadow and flame yet….ill be waiting forever for this sad.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sad.gif]

 

 

Unless you have a local store which you support, which is great :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png], you might give some thought on order shadow and flame via miniaturemarket. I ordered I think Saturday and I got it today Wednesday here in Norway. Not even my domestic "dealer" delivers that quick :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] just a heads up. Sorry for sidetracking.

 

 

unfortunatly no store within around 200 miles….i preorder my packs about 3 months ahead of time as i usually dont have money at the time of release, so its either wait a long time with a guarantee of getting it, or gamble on having money to buy it at the time

either way i will consider an over seas purchase next time

How much does an AP cost you??



usually about £11.50 including shipping

i use the same supplier which gets them last, however has them available for preorder first out of all the country. so whenever i have money to spare i pre order one….works out in the end, i guess its either that or nothing

Nori + Spirit Bofur = At a cost of 1, your threat at the same level from turn to turn. With horn of Gondor the cost is reduced to 0. 



Yea I was thinking about this as well. I am surprised that they didn't phrase it like Legacy of Durin. This certainly takes care of any threat reduction needed for one of my dwarf decks.

Well, I bought two at the same time so I think the shipping went up a little. But it was $12 in shipping. And they had them on sale for $9.72 pr. pack (even shadow and flame) normal price $14.99. But total I payed $31.44 = £22 for two packs and shipping. So it won't cost you anything more :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] oh, and you can pre order also. But don't know how long time in advance though.

Got mine. Just glanced through the manual.

One thing that struck me as unusual/interesting - there's no difficulty rating for the 3 quests! Probably a good idea to drop them, as the difficulty ratings never seemed to be an accurate gauge of how hard the quests actually were. Player experiences varied greatly.

Another interesting thing - on the back of the insert they acknowledge that many of the heroes and allies from The Lord of the Rings: TCG don't exist yet in The Hobbit and so "for a more thematic game experience" they list 2 Hobbit-period decks that use only cards from the core set and The Hobbit: Over Hill and Under Hill to get players started. One deck uses Gimli, Thalin, and Ori. The other uses Thorin Oakenshield, Gloin, and Nori. Thoughtful and cool!

Also, not sure if this was posted yet or not, but the next Hobbit saga expansion is called The Hobbit: On the Doorstep.

Hmmmm the skip difficulty rating only for saga or for next cycles as well? Good question!

So what you can tell about scenarios??? How good they are in your opinion?

My retailer of choice, 13th floor, usually gets them pretty sharpish, and has The Hobbit due in 22.8.12, which is actually quite decent! Going on past experience, that'll mean I'll have it on the doormat on Thursday. They're full price, but it's free first-class shipping, with free stuff on orders over £10! (Yes, I should earn commission…)
