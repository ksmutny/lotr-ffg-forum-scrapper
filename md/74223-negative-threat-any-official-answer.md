So, the issue popped out here: http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=285&efcid=4&efidt=736831 [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=285&efcid=4&efidt=736831]

Seems that according to comments there's a general idea on the forum but no official answer. I was hoping we get one…

Thanks!

Javier

well…no i cant remember if this was every officially faq-d or anything, but i am 99.99% sure you cannot. the question has come up many times since the games release and not once has it been decided you can as it was assumed to not make any sense

if you want to make sure you can put in a rules request, but in this case i doubt its needed
