What's everyone's proffered cheese? I'm quite fond of cheddar. It's quite versatile and delicious. I do love me a good mozzarella though. Parmesan too. I mean, just in general, cheese is just so **** good. Ngon lắm! (Vietnamese for very delicious!).

Feta, of course. Stomps all other cheese varieties without mercy.

Gouda is my favourite. Followed by Goats Feta.

This is just pathetic.

Do you guys really label Gouda and Feta as cheese? :/
