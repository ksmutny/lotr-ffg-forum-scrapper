Can I use A Test of Will to cancel the When Revealed effect on stage 2A? My guess is no as it seems a pretty important mechanic in this quest, but it is a "when revealed" effect.

Test of Will cancels "the 'when revealed' effects of a card that was just revealed from the encounter deck."Â  Quest cards are not revealed from the encounter deck.

Thought so - I wondered if the quest cards were considered part of the encounter deck, but the rulebook apparently calls them a quest deck. Thanks.
