where have you played LotR LCG, and where would you like to?   The topic was supposed to be "The places you have LotR'd" but somehow I accidentally posted the thing while writing the topic line (???) and it doesn't look like there is any way to change it.

 

 

Only counting real cards!  OCTGN solves too many physical problems :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

 

For me:

 

- At home, or friends' houses of course.  On the coffee table, on the floor, and on the bed.

- On university campus in a common room

- In the backyard in the grass (with blankets of course)

- In various parks in the grass or on a picnic table

- While camping, at a picnic table or in the tent

- At various coffee shops

- At the parents' house whilst fighting off intruding felines

 

 

And on my wishlist:

- while backpacking :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] I'm that nerdy, just haven't gotten around to it yet.

- while on an airplane, wouldn't THAT be a feat!

Home & hotel. Can't imagine playing on an airplane with paper, but maybe if I got to sit upfront.

When on business travel, I've brought my cards with me and played in the hotel.  Even though I have my laptop with OCTGN installed, I still like to have the cardboard in front of me.  If my travels bring me to a city with a near-by FLGS, I like to try to play there as well.

Backpacking, both the Rockies and Olympics. However, only with our old Decipher LOTRCCGBRB cards, feels like too many pieces for the LCG... but they are ultimately so similar in gameplay that I think it counts. Also, it is so humid in the olympics that you should expect unsleeved cards to warp a bit in the evening. Car camping is much better for the LCG, I wouldn't mind an official two-player mat to drop over a wood table.

 

Edit: now wasting my coffee break looking up blank game boards for a good in-tent or on-ground surface, the typical Z-rest only got us so far, but... 1 lbs seems typical, and that is a lot of dead weight.

Mostly at home, but I take decks with me to conferences, so a variety of hotels as well. The fanciest place was a Fellow's room in Oxford named after T.S. Eliot, which had a massive old dining table.
