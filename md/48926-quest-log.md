So, I was tracking my scores using the Quest Log on the website... but I can't seem to find it any more. I was accessing it from the main page, but it's been removed from there. Is there another place I can find it?

Also, is there any way to share your log with other people? It's awesome being able to track scores, but it would be nice to have it show up on my profile or something.

 There is a "More..." tab at the top of the FFG pages.  The quest log is one of the items on its scroll-down menu.

As far as sharing goes, you can only share your scores with people on your List of Friends from your FFG profile.

Doh... not sure how I missed that. Thanks! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

How do I share the scores once I have someone on my friends list?

 There is a compare quests button on the top right of the quest view area.  That's how you can compare your scores with your friend's.  You can't show your friends your scores unfortunately.  They have to compare your scores to theirs on their quest log.

Ah, boo. It would be really nice to just have a link I could send to people so they could view my quests.
