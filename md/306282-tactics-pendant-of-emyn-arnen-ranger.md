I do think we still miss an ally which increases the attack power based on the threat of a trapped enemy. A shield-based one is not needed, because of traps.

Where is my red Emyn Arnen Ranger?

Just wanted to share this thought. Not much else of value here, sorry.

That would be cool! There are so many different characters they could still do. Hopefully more are coming after the break!
