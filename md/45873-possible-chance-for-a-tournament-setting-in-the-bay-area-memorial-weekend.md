We are attending Kublacon in Burlingame, California on the weekend of may 27-30.

Among other FFG events (AGoT Regionals, and Warhammer: Invasion Regionals), we will be getting a group together for potentially some organized LotR play.

If you are interested, check out kublacon.com or get in touch with me if you have any additional questions.

 I'm not even remotely near the area, but wish you the best of luck! More importantly, are you planning on running an actual competitive tournament? If so, are you planning on using any special rules to make it fair and ensure there's no cheating? I mean, if you're using the honor system, that's cool, but I'd love to hear about any ideas other people have for running a tournament.

We will see how many people show up.  i don't expect it will be competitive, no.

Eventually, you will have to have roaming judges, I would guess.

My idea would be to have solo-play tournaments, but with two players per table. If one player takes his turn, the other acts as referee and v.v. The only disadvantage is that it will take up more time, but it removes the need for honour or roaming judges.

Hrm.  I guess that would work.

That wouldn't be too cumbersome, particularly if both players did phases right after each other so they'd be judging the same phase they were playing at the time which would keep their minds on the ruleset around that phase.
