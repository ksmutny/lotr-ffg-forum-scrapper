I have lost 3 in a row. Different Hero's each time. The Hill troll is beating up on me! I am playing cards that can only really prevent its attack each round...when it attacks though, it is doing serious damage. I cannot get thru 5 or so rounds before my hero's are out or my threat is exhausted.

I have tried a tactics deck, a Spirit/Lore deck and even a Leadership/Tactics deck.

Any other suggestions? I may be able to go longer in the quest if I could get this troll off my back quickly.

i tend to do anything BUT fight it, so ill get a low starting threat, use galadhrim greetings to get it lower, then pick away at it with dunhere, and sneak attacked gandalfs.

then that should have it with plenty of damage, if all else fails i let it engage for a turn, use a cheap ally, take the extra threat, then finish it off.

you could also try forest snaring it, but of course that means it has to attack at least one, unless you use faint, so let it engage, faint it, then snare it, and its useless

Check, Check, and Check. Just built a new deck that should hit all your points. Trying to get a resource heavy deck that allows me to play ally's to absorb the damage. Will keep you posted.

I think that is where the "quite easily" comes in. I only have 1 core set and HFG, CAtC, and JtR Adventure Packs.

the 3 unexpected courage is a huge help....i only have 1 core set but man...if you could only buy singles then i would get 2 more of those

UC is not really important. 2 is enough to. I have only 2 core set. So other cards you just make a proxy.

Wait, an enemy has to attack so that I can trap it? I thought it's enough to engage an enemy as I can then perform player actions.

Or can I only play it in the 1. phase because it counts as an attachment? 

## 10 [Eryx_UK on January 19, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59174-drowning-on-the-anduin/?do=findComment&comment=581691)

Attachments, like Allies, can only be played in the planning phase at the start of the turn. Against this quest I try to keep my threat low, get some allies out, let one of them take the hit from the troll and then forest snare it. 

## 11 [hendersondayton on January 19, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59174-drowning-on-the-anduin/?do=findComment&comment=581715)

So Aragorn, Gloin, and Theodred is not a good idea?

Everyone is saying start low...how low? I played Aragorn, Gloin, and Theodred and was fortunate enough to be able to play The Galadhrim's Greeting and lower the threat....kept the troll in the staging area for a few rounds but, i couldn't draw enough allies to absorb damage when the troll finally attacked.

This was my last attempt:

2 Faramir
3 Guard of the Citadel
1 Longbeard Orc Slayer
2 Snowbourn Scout
2 Son of Arnor
1 Celebrian's Stone
1 Dunedain Mark
1 Dunedain Warning
2 Steward of Gondor
2 Ever Vigilant
2 For Gondor!
1 Grim Resolve
3 Second Breakfast
2 Sneak Attack
2 Valiant Sacrifice
2 The Favor of the Lady
1 Unexpected Courage
2 A Test of Will
2 Hasty Stroke
2 The Galadhrim's Greeting
1 Henamarth Riversong
1 Dark Knowledge
2 Forest Snare
2 Protector of Lorien
2 Self Preservation
3 Gandalf
3 Song of Wisdom
Heroes:
1 Aragorn
1 Gloin
1 Theodred

low as you can, i choose heros under 10, i think 9s a good amount....dunheres 9, eowyns 9, elanors a 7 (i think im right with them 3) aragorn is too expensive for this quest in my opinion. try frodo.

you really do benefit from giving yourself loads and loads of time....to the point where you have like 10 turns to deal with the thing, in 10 turns alot can happen....you can have a whole army of allies out by then, you can have attatchements on every hero, the whole lot, then the troll will fall in 1 or 2 turns easily

and to the above no you cant snare an enemy that has just engaged, you can only play attatchments in the planning phase

## 13 [alpha5099 on January 19, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59174-drowning-on-the-anduin/?do=findComment&comment=581773)

I've had very good luck with a Spirit/Leadership/Lore deck, using Eowyn, Theodred, and either Denethor or Beravor, which puts your starting threat at either 26 or 27. If you have the resources to pay for it, I've found the combo of a Son of Arnor and Forest Snare to be very effective. Force the Troll to engage during Planning and Snare it while you can play the attachment.

## 14 [hendersondayton on January 19, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59174-drowning-on-the-anduin/?do=findComment&comment=581774)

I am giving Dunhere, Elenore, and Gimli a go. Starting at 26. Gives me 4 rounds to try to get enough ally's on the table to deal with him. Will also try to add some attachments to Dunhere to increase his attack strength and get the troll while he is in the staging area and cannot attack.

Not able to use son of Arnor this game (didn't include a Leadership Character or Song of Kings)...will have to hope for ally's to absorb the damage the same turn i play the Forest Snare.

## 17 [hendersondayton on January 19, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59174-drowning-on-the-anduin/?do=findComment&comment=581875)

UPDATE: Lost this quest due to threat level In the middle of turn 9. I was able to deal with the Hill Troll pretty quickly by using Dunhere and the Dwarven Axe to apply a point of damage per round while it was in the staging area...Forest Snare helped after I threw an ally at it to absorb damage (took a few points to the threat level for that). However, I couldn't get out of Stage 1B before my threat went up.

Started at 26 and hit 50 in the refresh phase of turn 9. Most of it was location damage. I didn't have enough Willpower with the three hero's i chose (5 if I quested all of them) and when your dealing with locations like "The Brown Lands" (threat 5), "Necromancer's Pass" (threat 3), and pesky enemies like Eastern Crows which surged another Eastern Crows and then a Wargs Encounter card....it gets away from you pretty quickly.

Northern tracker helped a lot as I was able to get rid of 3 locations while in the staging area.

This make 5 loss's in a row at the hands of the Anduin. I am not moving on till i beat this thing!

firstly for the brown lands use striders path if you can- takes you straight there without having to deal with its 5 threat

as you said trackers are good, try and get both in if you can

did you draw any galadhrim greetings? two of these -12 threat, then get a gandalf in thats -5 threat, so you could get -17 threat with just three cards there

point is is that you have to draw them! so are you using any card draw techniques? gleowine?

also use riversong as well....at 1 cost hes a great ally

also it probably took me embarrasingly more amount of trys till i got this one- stick at it happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]

This was my deck:

1 Beorn
2 Gondorian Spearman
1 Horseback Archer
3 Winged Guardian
1 Blade of Gondolin
1 Citadel Plate
2 Dwarven Axe
2 Feint
2 Quick Strike
1 Swift Strike
1 Eomund
1 Northern Tracker
2 Westfold Horse-Breaker
2 Power in the Earth
2 The Favor of the Lady
1 Unexpected Courage
2 A Light in the Dark
2 A Test of Will
2 Hasty Stroke
2 Mustering the Rohirrim
2 Strength of Will
2 The Galadhrim's Greeting
3 A Burning Brand
2 Forest Snare
2 Self Preservation
3 Gandalf
3 Song of Wisdom
Heroes:
1 Dunhere
1 Gimli
1 Eleanor
 

I was out before I could draw the Galadhrim or Gandalf but at the rate that I was playing ally's I was out of Resource. My strategy (tell me if it is a bad one) was to have two spheres covered with Hero's (Spirit/Tactics) and then add the Song for the Lore cards I was wanting (Forest Snare). I just couldn't keep resources on the table so even if I did draw Galadhrim or Gandalf, I would not have been able to play them without the sneak attack card which is in the leadership sphere.

I did see the strider's but was not able to get them in the deck. Would not have helped much in that situation because another location was in play (The East Bight)

Please make suggestions on how I could revise the above deck keeping in mind I have 1 Core, and AP's HFG, CaTC, JTR, HoEM.

ok my two ways that id go about this

1. switch out gimli for thalin.....get rid of them infuriating crows and their surge...surge really can kill you in any quest...or....

2.forget about the 3 sphere deck- it isnt wrong at all what your doing, infact i think most players do this, but i prefer to have just 2, 3 waters things down too much. all of my shadows of mirkwood and khazad victories were with double sphere decks. i would go spirit/lore and have 3 heros that corespond to that, so maybe bilbo, eowyn, dunhere, all lowish threat, or if you want lower switch out one for frodo or elanor

concentrate on two things

spirit for questing power and threat reduction

lore for card draw and getting those important cards then using protector of lorien to exploit that unlimited action per turn

when you have the cards you want, and with bilbos extra card draw and gleowines 1 card per turn, you will have 10-20 cards in your hand at a time, so no more waiting for what you want, so when you have them only having two spheres should help with paying for them, obviously include songs of wisdom and im not sure which pack song of travel is in but if you have it use it

my only strategy i can vouch for for this quest is threat reduction and sniping off the troll as stated before....then with spirit and protector of lorien you can discard 10 or so cards at a time

eowyn with +1 = 5 willpower

say frodo or someone like with protector and +10 willpower

you have yourself 15 willpower there, its basically

1.card draw

2.threat reduction

3.card discarding to buff up willpower for 2b

 As an extra buffer to rich's comments, you could put in Longbeard map-maker.  Lorien guide would also help.  Try to key in on ur main cards and put as many in as you can up to the 3 limit.  I know you will only have 2 of some, but do what you can.  Also, favor of the lady.  Finally, when you get to the stage where you're on the river, the middle stage, even though you don't have to engage, do it anyway, through dunhere if you want, so that the final stage will be easier.

.....well you cant really....cant think of anyway at the moment, probably if you know that the troll only has one turn of life left, you take the threat and a dead ally, or let frodo take it and add the threat

also map maker is great. especially with protector, its a willpower overload!

You don't. Even the Son of Arnor engages the troll--it just allows you to do so during the Planning Phase, when you can follow up with a Forest Snare. If you aren't running the SoA, your best bet is to use Feint to negate the troll's initial attack. You can then play the Snare on your next turn. Alternately, keep your threat low and kill the troll (Dunhere+Dunedain Mark, Gandalf, Descendant of Thorondor, etc.) before it ever engages you.

Without the Son of Arnor, though, it's impossible to engage the troll and Snare it in the same turn.

i think im right in saying without running tactics or leadership its impossible to do both in the same turn

I know this got talked about later in the thread, but my first thought on seeing the hero lineup was who on earth is questing for you? Total of 4 WP if all three quest, that's like the vanilla core set Tactics deck bad in terms of questing. Two Spirit heroes probably help a bit at least in getting Northern Trackers out, but still.

Have you tried upping how many allies you include in your deck? Some people have suggested having up to half (25 cards) allies in a deck, and I've found that works really well. Another thing is, make sure you're choosing as many low-cost allies as possible. Beorn is a beast, but having to save up 6 resources is a pain and limits what you can do for six phases.

Heroes:

I was out before I could draw the Galadhrim or Gandalf but at the rate that I was playing ally's I was out of Resource. My strategy (tell me if it is a bad one) was to have two spheres covered with Hero's (Spirit/Tactics) and then add the Song for the Lore cards I was wanting (Forest Snare). I just couldn't keep resources on the table so even if I did draw Galadhrim or Gandalf, I would not have been able to play them without the sneak attack card which is in the leadership sphere.

I did see the strider's but was not able to get them in the deck.

Please make suggestions on how I could revise the above deck keeping in mind I have 1 Core, and AP's HFG, CaTC, JTR, HoEM.

 

 

ok my two ways that id go about this

1. switch out gimli for thalin.....get rid of them infuriating crows and their surge...surge really can kill you in any quest...or....

2.forget about the 3 sphere deck- it isnt wrong at all what your doing, infact i think most players do this, but i prefer to have just 2, 3 waters things down too much. all of my shadows of mirkwood and khazad victories were with double sphere decks. i would go spirit/lore and have 3 heros that corespond to that, so maybe bilbo, eowyn, dunhere, all lowish threat, or if you want lower switch out one for frodo or elanor

concentrate on two things

spirit for questing power and threat reduction

lore for card draw and getting those important cards then using protector of lorien to exploit that unlimited action per turn

when you have the cards you want, and with bilbos extra card draw and gleowines 1 card per turn, you will have 10-20 cards in your hand at a time, so no more waiting for what you want, so when you have them only having two spheres should help with paying for them, obviously include songs of wisdom and im not sure which pack song of travel is in but if you have it use it

my only strategy i can vouch for for this quest is threat reduction and sniping off the troll as stated before....then with spirit and protector of lorien you can discard 10 or so cards at a time

eowyn with +1 = 5 willpower

say frodo or someone like with protector and +10 willpower

you have yourself 15 willpower there, its basically

1.card draw

2.threat reduction

3.card discarding to buff up willpower for 2b

 

 

 

 

Have you tried upping how many allies you include in your deck? Some people have suggested having up to half (25 cards) allies in a deck, and I've found that works really well. Another thing is, make sure you're choosing as many low-cost allies as possible. Beorn is a beast, but having to save up 6 resources is a pain and limits what you can do for six phases.

 

 

yeah you gotta have plenty of friendlies for this one........actually the best fodder ive came across is snowbourn scout...pay 1 to put into play...put a progress token on something ...then watch the dude bite the dust

Feint is in the Tactics Sphere and I am trying to build a Spirit/Lore deck per Rich's suggestion.

## 33 [hendersondayton on January 19, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59174-drowning-on-the-anduin/?do=findComment&comment=582018)

Here is what I have so far. As Rich and others have said, I was concentrating on Spirit/Lore to Reduce Threat, Draw Cards, and boost Willpower.

 

Heroes

• Éowyn CS 7
• Bilbo Baggins SOM 1
• Dúnhere CS 9

Deck

3x Escort from Edoras (SOM 55)
2x Northern Tracker (CS 45)
2x The Favor of the Lady (CS 55)
1x Unexpected Courage (CS 57)
2x The Galadhrim's Greeting (CS 46)
2x • Gléowine (CS 62)
3x Longbeard Map-Maker (SOM 32)
2x Forest Snare (CS 69)
2x Protector of Lórien (CS 70)

3x Strider's Path (SOM 9)
3x • Gandalf (CS 73)
2x Song of Travel (SOM 81)
2x Song of Wisdom (SOM 34)

Total 31

My only issue right now is Ally's for Spirit/Lore are expensive and crappy

you say you have everything up to eymn? im just looking on deckbuilder for your options

you could sort of have a rohan sub theme with eomund, horse breaker and riddermarks finest...a bit rubbish on attack though

haldirs handy as an ally....

henmarth riversongs great for peeking at the encounter deck

miner of the iron hills and erebor ironsmith are two good cheap ones

wandering tooks ok as a defender/throw away ally

lorien guide i find a bit expensive compared to northern tracker whos much better and only 1 more

daughter of the nimrodel is good if you want to spend 3 on an ally that is basically a life support system

gildors good but expensive

i think thats about it...probably doesnt help you much

ill add stuff as i think of it

Looking at your deck, I think it's fine, beside having only one Northern Tracker. Replace Horseback Archer (too costy) with NT.  I'd use Frodo instead of Eleanor, as you're lacking questing power. Frodo is also a last line of defense against the troll if everything else goes wrong. Thódred is always a good choice for 3 sphere decks.

 

If you don't want to rely on Forest Snare you could also use Song of Kings instead of Wisdom. This supplies you with Steward of Gondor, Celbrían's Stone, Sneak Attack and 3 Dunedain Marks. Give the latter to Dunhere, and the troll might be dead before he's able to engage you.

 

Don't think this has been mentioned, you could use Gimli + Dwarven Axe + PoL. When playing Anduin Gimli is one of my questers, so PoL helps to get more WP. However, when it's about beating the troll, I usually try to engage him when I have attached both Dwarven Axe and PoL on Gimli, and Gandalf or Feints is in my hand. Gimli defends against the troll, with PoL as his life assurance and he gets 4 damage. Next round he has 8 attack. Play Gandalf or Feint to block the next attack, and let Gimli and some allies attack the troll. He should be dead by now, or he has only 1 HP left. If the latter is the case, you can easily take him out with a Gondorian Spearman.

I am not sure what you mean by "card pool" (forgive me). I am playing Spirit/Lore Hero's with Song of Kings and a couple Leadership Attachments (Celebrian and Steward of Gondor) to boost willpower and Resources.

If you are referring to what sets do i have: 1 Core, and Adventure Packs HFG, CaTC, JtR, HoEM

Wow! What a gem this thread is! I'm in the same situation, stuck on Anduin with solo play. I only have one core set and have only been playing since Christmas, but this thread gave me some great ideas. The interesting thing is that I played some 4 player games when I first got it and we beat every single game and played all three scenarios from the core set. I'm playing solo now and it feels impossible! After reading this, though, I think I'll try Anduin again.

I tried Anduin thrice solo and twice with three players and the standard decks and closest I got to winning (that is I killed the troll) was in one solo game.

After playing this scenario a number of times with may different hero sphere combinations, this scenario leads me to believe it should be higher than a difficulty 4.  Basically if you flip over any extra hard to deal with enemies (like a second troll) you just scoop and start over.  It almost feels like you need a opening hand with sneak attack and Gandalf to really have a chance at this one.

That's not entirely true. Especially the second part.

While I would agree it is not as easy as one should expect of a Dif. 4, there is no simple 'you lost' draw on the encounter deck. Even if you flip a second Troll or, a beastmaster, or the Adder, whatever; you always have a chance.

 

The most appealing facet of this game is that you can overcome (almost) impossible odds, in the face of death, after losing two of your Heroes, you pull that nice strategy in your mind and then, BOOM! Shakalaka. You made it! You won!

Crap. It is way more interesting to win after being almost decimated than just 'Rohannize' the quest after a couple of turns.

 

I still do'nt have a good Rhosgobel win ratio, and that's the reason I build several decks to beat the entire cycle instead of a single scenario. I have to plan accordingly to each scenario's strengths. So, in Rhosgobel, I either must have a good deal of healing, or lots of shadow-meta and treachery-meta. It's nice to play that way.

 

 

More to the point, the Trolls can be managed by Gimli or Gandalf, and then, be bombardied (sp?) by a good lot of 1-2 cost guys... or again, Gimli.

That Orc with victory points in the Anduin is more of a worry than the Trolls, in my opinion, if you don't kill it soon, he'll be a PAIN to deal with. The adder is another one you should worry; still, after all being said, last night I had 16 (out of 24) points of victory in Anduin, defeating (IIRC) 2 Trolls, 2 victory locations and the orc mentioned earlier.

 

Hope it helps. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

When I played with 4 players it was with the standard core sets, and we probably ruled some minor things incorrectly which seems to be common, but with the solo decks I've been trying to multisphere. It's just hard because if you have one hero quest, one defend, and one attack, you'll never do damage to the hill troll unless you get Gimli, Gandalf, or can play lots of heroes. I agree with the above statement, I feel like you pretty much need Gandalf in your starting hand to have a chance at this one.

 This is a quest that my first few plays through (both solo and two-player) I managed to win, and only did it feel easy. More recently I've tried playing it in solo again and have been getting my butt-kicked. :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

 

I played last night with an all Spirit deck. Low Threat, build up a bunch of allies, etc. I had myself pretty well prepared for the troll, I payed for Gandalf, sent just some Westroad Travelers to Quest, and then I drew the crows...who surged the other Troll. With both trolls bearing down at me (and Chieften Uthak waiting in the staging area) I just couldn't pull it off.

 

I think my last solo victory had been a Lore/Tactics deck With Bilbo, Glorfindel, and Legolas. I'm nigh certain that victory involved the use of a Forest Snare (and Possibly a Feint card).

Tried last night with tactics and spirit combo of Legolas, Glorfindel and Brand (starting threat of 28) with a heavy eagles sub theme, still failed overall due to reaching 50 threat but was able to handle the troll without to much hassle.  Going to try again tonight and see if I can pull it off.  Surge can really be a game changer when your thinking your in good shape.

i would say ditch glorfindel, thats one of the reasons why your threat maxed out probably

 Success! I finally beat this scenario last night! Here’s how it happened:
Card Pool: 1 Core Set
Heroes: Thalin, Eowyn, Dunhere (26 threat)
Deck: Spirit starter deck, all 1 and 2 cost Tactics cards except Rain of Arrows, and Gandalf (3x)

Game 1
I was totally overwhelmed by enemies and all my heroes were killed. After the game I realized that I was allowing the Eastern Crows Surge to happen before Thalin took them out. I also forgot to add excess Hill Troll damage to my threat.

Game 2
I exceeded 50 threat. Got Blade of Gondolin on Dunhere so he could attack the staging area, but when I beat stage 1, I quickly got Marsh Adder, Chieftan Ufthak, and 2 Gladden Fields in addition to various other enemies. I didn’t have enough Will to overcome that, but didn’t have enough allies in play to optionally engage. With Blade of Gondolin, I think I got 3 or 4 progress tokens on the quest before losing.

Game 3
I finally won!
It took 13 rounds and I ended with 19 threat and 4 damage on my heroes. I collected 8 Victory Points so my final score was 145 (revised) or 15 (old). I got a Dwarven Axe on both Thalin and Dunhere and also had Unexpected Courage on Dunhere. Eowyn had The Favor of the Lady.

I drew a Treachery card to start with, so the Hill Troll was the only enemy in the beginning. Dunhere got the axe on round 2 and started chipping away at the Hill Troll until I played Gandalf (lowered threat) and had him defend while Thalin, Dunhere and Northern Tracker finished off the troll. I used both Galadhrim’s Greetings and used it a third time with Dwarven Tomb. Other allies were Northern Tracker, Gondorian Spearman, and Veteran Axehand. Stage 2 was easy with Eowyn, Northern Tracker, and Thalin questing while Dunhere attacked twice (UC) into the staging area to clean it up (at 4 atk). I drew a lot of Eastern Crows because they get shuffled in when defeated. For Stage 3 setup, a Treachery and a Location card were revealed, so I won.

I know this is the wrong thread but I wasn't able to find the answer to my query via forum-search:

 

Can someone give me a list of two mixed sphere starting decks out of one coreset box, which could be a starting point for further deckbuilding. My second coreset and some adventure packs are already ordered but I'm at a loss concerning deckbuilding. Seems more difficult than with MAGIC gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif].

 

And by the way gratulations, I'm still working on the task...

ah the forum search sucks a bit, but if you go back a couple of pages there are several threads like this one- theres one regarding rhosgobel quest thats pretty long, this thread has several decks listed in it, or whats best is start your own thread then we can give you the best help gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]

 I too was struggling with this quest for quite some time, but yesterday I was finally able beat it (easily actually). I used a simple spirit / lore combo deck to draw a crap-load of cards (for questing with Eowyn) and to keep my threat low. I was able to run through the quest with ease (and I even pulled a second troll).

You could also go to http://www.cardgamedb.com/ [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/index.php?/forum/18-lotr-lcg-general-discussion/] and you'll find a lot of decks there. :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

There is also a LCG forum there (way better, btw).

You know that  you can only discard one card on your turn for Eowyn, right? I mean drawing extra cards is nice for her because you get to pick your most useless card to toss, but it's not like Protector of Lorien where you can go through a whole mess of cards to power through a quest.

I don't mean to sound like I'm saying you were playing it wrong, I'm just checking.

 Well, I guess I did play it wrong then. Back to square one... :/

Thanks by the way; it is not the first time I don't read the card's text carefully enough.

Well if you had Protector of Lorien on her, it would have been absolutely fine. That one does have unlimited action. So on that point, at least you don't have to worry about completely reconstructing your deck.

I did have it in my deck, but I don't think it was on her (or on anyone else for that matter). I am very careless sometime. :/

Nevertheless, I will certainly give it a try again, as I still feel this deck might be the one to deal with this quest successfully.

as the OP of this thread i feel compelled to share with everyone that on my 7th try i finally defeated the quest!!!!!!

As most have said, threat reduction as well as playing the snare to prevent the troll from attacking got me out of the first stage....after that...massive amounts of Willpower got me thru to the final stage where I only had to defeat two crow cards....

I have never been so excited to move on...

up next....escape from dul guldur!!!

Congrats! I haven't tried Escape from Dol Guldur solo yet. Maybe we should start a "Trapped in Dol Guldur" thread and keep each other posted on how we do!
