Hey guys!  I'm looking for the most recent LotR LCG plugin for LackeyCCG.  Does anyone know where I can find one?  I have up to the Black Riders but I'm hoping there's one for cards after that.

At the moment, there is not: TragicTheBlathering is a busy guy, apparently! Here's the latest thing I've seen him post re: Lackey...

I too eagerly await an update.

Do yourself a favor: start using OCTGN.

I use OCTGN sometimes. It rarely feels like a favor. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

Well, if it's anything like Lackey, I'd just assume use Lackey...I'm pretty comfortable with how to use it.

If you're comfortable with it - why create this thread?

2-handed solo in OCTGN is a pain in the neck.

I've never really had a problem with two handed play in OCTGN as soon as I figured out how to do it.

Yeah, I too tried Octgn. Just don't feel as smooth and easy-to-use as lackey. Very clunky. End the updates are even more rare than the ones for lackey and the LotR plugin. I would suggest following the lackey plugin update on the cardgamedb site. Just go to the LotR forum and you will find the lackey thread easy. Tragic also explains how you can update the plugin yourself if you want to. Really easy. Can also recommend CardWarden for iPad.

It really comes down to taste as I've always preferred OCTGN's interface over Lackey's. Anyway, the main difference between the two is that OCTGN is consistently updated. It is currently up to date on both the Saga's and up through The Dread Realm.
