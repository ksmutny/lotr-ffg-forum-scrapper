# [Enjoying the LotR LCG...and the distribution.](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52670-enjoying-the-lotr-lcgand-the-distribution/)

After reading what the LCG concept was all about, I thought this was a great way to get involved with an awesome card game with a great distribution of all cards so that any card was available to everyone.

After reading about the decks people are building, I've seen that most people are buying multiple core sets to be able to include 3x of very useful cards.  I get that the card pool, divided among 4 influence spheres, is pretty stretched out and makes deck building quite challenging.  My idea is that the core game is said by FFG to be able to play through complete with the cards included in that set alone.  I really am opposed to buying multiple core sets for that third Steward of Gondor or more Dwarven Tombs.  The game should, and is I'm sure, able to play through with the single set.

Please don't take me wrong. If a player wants to buys multiple sets, go for it!  We all enjoy a game differently and want to build decks how we want them.  I'm glad, however, that the Adventure Packs are including 3 of each new sphere card!  No buying multiple APs to get cards that are extremely useful and for this, I'm thankful.

I'm going to play through the core scenerios with the cards from a single core set because I interpret this is the way the game was meant to be played.  Are there any others that plan to play this way?

 I agree that buying the multiple core sets is frustrating and seems unnecessary. The difficulty is in the fact that having a third copy of many of the cards is a very good thing. I myself bought two core sets and really love having that 3rd Northern Tracker and 3rd Steward of Gondor. However, I played for quite awhile with just one core set and did not find the experience at all less rewarding. It depends what your goals are with the game. I am very focused on deck building and it makes me anxious to not have that 3rd copy of great cards. If you are just looking for an enjoyable experience and do not want to drop that extra 30 bucks on a second core set I do not blame you. The game has been expanded fairly well through the first three adventure packs and I am sure that will continue to be the case.

I still only own one core set, and I've had fun with deck building using the AP's.  I've considered buying a second core set for expanded deck-building possibilities, but in the end I haven't been able to justify it to myself.  The good thing is that people have fun playing the game regardless of how many core sets they have.

I only have one core set and I don't plan to buy another. I only play 2 player or solo games and I enjoy the challenge that comes with not having 3 each of the most powerful cards. I've played with proxies on occasion to see what it's like and I've concluded that I prefer the game a little harder. I'm not opposed to other people buying multiple copies and I don't hold a grudge against FFG for releasing the core set the way they did. I am glad, however, that the adventure packs contain 3 of each card. This way it leaves open the option to maybe in the future change my mind and pick up a second core set and not worry about the adventure packs.

In short, Play the game you want to play and have fun!

In our group we by three sets per Two Players.

So everyone has his own set and then team up with someone to share a second set with.

Saves us money and gives us three of all cards except the "single" ones (of which you get two for some as divided with your friend).

Works for us.

It's just like any other LCG: If you don't plan to participate in tournaments, there's no reason to buy several core sets.

If you want to play in tournaments and optimize your chance of winning, then it's likely you'll have to buy at least a second core set.
