# [Question about East-gate.](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/92279-question-about-east-gate/)

I've just started playing the Khazad-Dûm expansion, and am sure i'm playing it correct, by placing the East-gate as the active location. But since it's a victory-card, it never gets placed in the discard-pile, or the staging area, once explored. And since it's immune to card effects, it can never be removed otherwise.

 

Then why does it have the big threat strength of 7???

 

What am i missing?

 

If the answer is, that it gets used later in some other scenario, then that's great news. But if not, then either it's a fault, that it even has a threat strength, or i'm doing something wrong.

it is not used again in any scenario and you are playing it correct

as for the 7 threat, i can only assume it is incase any future cards whose strength depends on the threat of any location in play in as an active location.

There are cards that can replace the active location and move it to the staging.  Forget the name

When Revealed: Immediately travel to Dreadful Gap. If another location is currently active, return it to the staging area.

X is the number of characters in play.

The rules specifically says that Dread Gap cannot be used against East-gate, since it's immune to all card effects.

ah right, i see....thought you meant player cards :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Ps - just checked the rules insert and so it does specifically say that no card can move it.

The location East-gate has the text, “Immune to card

effects.” This means that East-gate cannot be selected as

the target of any card effect, and it ignores the effect of any

card that would directly interact with it. The only way to

place progress tokens on it is by questing, and once Eastgate

is the active location it remains the active location

until it is fully explored (even cards like Dreadful Gap or

Strider’s Path would not be able to move it to the staging

area).

Is it possible to get some kind of official answer to this? My OCD really needs it :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

"Immune to card effects" is the official wording on the card. The clarification in the rules sheet insert confirms this. You cannot directly effect the East-Gate with cards while it is in play, and the only way to place progress tokens on it is through questing successfully. My guess is that the high-threat on the card is to thematically represent how dangerous of a location it is. Not everything in this game has a mechanical basis, some of the design decisions are for providing the style/theme.

indeed- the answer is directly from the rules insert.

further clarification can be seen from the fact that caleb changed the rulings on immune locations that they cannot even have the likes of ancient mathom attatched to them

Maybe FFG just left the door open for the future? Maybe in future show up some card that will be above than the effect of "Immune to card effects. "(but terribly expensive). As you can see The Namelless Fear has Hit Points and Defense, despite the fact that in no way can be attacked.

I have not seen this card yet, since I'm only at the Into the Pit scenario, but I can see that it now makes a "little" more sense.

There could easily be a future player card that uses location threat as an 'X'.

 

"Heal X damage, where  X is the threat of the active location", etc
