Hi,

just got a quick question about those 0 cost cards.

 

Let´s assume I´m playing with three lore heroes. Is it possible to put some o cost cards from other spheres into my deck and play them? Or do I need their resourcesymbol to play them even if they cost 0?

 

Thanks alot!

Rulebook, p.12:

This might be a good time to note some nuances:

 

- A Good Harvest does not help you to play 0-cost off-sphere cards, since you are not actually spending any resources to play them.

- Similarly, hero Elrond cannot play a 0-cost off-sphere ally, e.g., Dunedain Hunter. (I guess this even applies if Elrond is paired with Spirit Theoden, and you try to play a Snowbourn Scout as your first Rohan ally without any Leadership heroes, or similar Grima shenanigans...)

- Hero Gandalf can play 0-cost off-sphere cards, but only off the top of the deck.
