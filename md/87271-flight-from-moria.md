Is it just me, or is this scenario much easier than you would expect? It's rated at a 7, but I completed it in just a few rounds. Kept bypassing quest cards to keep the Nameless Fear's stats down until I got Blocked by Shadow, then took a risk and didn't reveal a Treachery. Then I quested with everyone and got out pretty easily. I didn't expect it to be as easy as The Seventh Level (DL3), but after struggling at the East-Gate for so many rounds in Into The Pit (DL5), I definitely expected a big fight.

 

Or maybe I did something wrong?

Well if you keep doing the discard a card and if treachery you lose card, you will soon learn that you almost always get a treachery.  I always beat the quest by getting the tools from the one quest card and then spending 4 turns to dig my way out. But yeah its really pretty easy.  Only a few bad cards in the whole deck

Yeah, encounter deck composition is greater than 50% treachery if I recall correctly.

 

It's one of those quests that's much harder with more players.  Bring 4 players to the table and let the reign of treachery commence!
