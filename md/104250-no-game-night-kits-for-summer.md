Hi all!

 

Between yesterday and today FFG posted the new batch of Game Night Kits for Summer 2014.

 

I found a bit strange that in some of those pages (like the one from Netrunner) told that they have been supporting cooperative games like Descent and LOTR, but there hasn't been any news related to season 5 (or, well, summer season) for LOTR.

 

What do you guys think? Maybe they're putting on a separate batch?

It looks like they're separate products, we have Tournament Kits in addition to Game Night kits. From what I gather, Tournament Kits are used for competitive games while Game Night Kits seem to be for the co-op games. I'd imagine we'll see a proper game night kit soon for LotR. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
