It seems that they have added some avatars from The Hobbit, but there are only a few from the Dwarrodelf cycle preocupado.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/preocupado.gif].

 Nice. I'm still waiting on Sam. But the new Baggins avatar will do for now :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 Pretty cool! Though my new avatar is so similar to the old one…

I wonder where are some of the avatars from. I haven't got The Hobbit, so I couldn't tell, but I really wonder which card is that depicting Gollum, it looks so cool. It's a shame it wasn't used in the actual Gollum card.

I've changed my avvy a few times, but prefer to stick to this one. It shows my mood whenever I see a n00b question that could be answered by reading the rules or card in question. Although perhaps grumpy-looking is a bit of an understatement of reality.

I'm 26 and have been getting silvers on the sides for a couple of years (thanks grad. school and marriage), but I won't be going bald (unless it's self-imposed).
