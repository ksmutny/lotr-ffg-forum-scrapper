1. Does Expert Hunter trigger the cache? Hunter says discard, but you don't actually discard it as you put it in your hand by calling attachment. And could you trigger it twice by exhausting pipe if it works? I would again think no b/c when you trigger pipe action you've past response window.

2. So Thalin is commited to the quest and you make enough progress to go through the quest card. The next quest card says "when revealed: reveal X number of cards and add any enemies to the staging area".

Does Thalin's ability damage any enemy coming out?

Thanks

1. yes, you discard the card, as per written on expert treasure hunter, but you can't use the action of the pipe between two response.

2. yes, revealed ennemies take damage, the card use the word reveal, so it works.

More importantly on 2), the cards are revealed "from the encounter deck". Had they been revealed from doing a search then "reveal and put into play", Thalin´s ability would not have worked.

According to this : http://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/122991-thalin-and-revealed-from-discard-pile/?p=1286920 [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/122991-thalin-and-revealed-from-discard-pile/?p=1286920], thalin now works on cards that are searched, even if you find them in the discard.

 

Thalin is loved by the devs :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

I was even part of that discussion and somehow managed to miss it.
