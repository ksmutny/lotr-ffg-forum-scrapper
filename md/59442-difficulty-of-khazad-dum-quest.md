i really do not know how you guys feel about the levels, but i think the quest are really low difficulty. i played 3 x 1st 2x 2nd and 2x 3rd quest and never lost, or even came close to......are your experiences nearly the same? (i am using bifur/gloin/eowyn)

i find khazad dum quests hard solo, not like dol guldur but harder than any mirkwood quests

I'm with rich, they're not exactly impossible, but I think I have yet to complete one. I've played 3x quest 1, and 1x quest 2 so far, with some decks that storm through Mirkwood quests, but they just come up dry here. I think my refusal to play this infamous Zigil Miner deck is probably what's putting me back angel.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/angel.gif]

Screw the Zigil Miner decks, I'm the spirit player for our group (3 player) and I refuse to build a ZM deck because I don't like the idea of just copying deck ideas other people on the forums have come up with.  I'd much rather play a fun and challenging game with my friends with our own builds than have a deck that gives us a near auto-win every time.  Maybe I'm just stubborn...
That being said, we didnt find the Khazad-dum quests too difficult.  Quest 1 defeated us twice before I got another Core and updated my deck a bit but we managed pretty well after that.  Quest 2 was a cakewalk, and we played Quest 3 twice in a row: first time we pulled Blocked by Shadow right away and took the gamble, all three of us made it out without being eliminated.  That was barely even a game in our opinion so we played it again, second time both exit cards were at the bottom of the stack but we still won pretty easily.

I find Into The Pit difficult...I played it 9 times solo before finally beating it by the skin of my teeth - ended with a 49 threat and Gandalf rescued me at the last minute (did not use a zigil miner deck).  The 7th Level hammered me 5 straight times...getting completely overwhelmed by orcs each time and I was questioning how it was only rated 3 and then the "strategy" for playing this scenario finally kicked in and I beat it quite easily now and it doesn't really require any special deck as long as you include a healthy mix of allies. I won't give away the strategy, but once you see it you'll kick yourself for why you didn't see it earlier.

I haven't tried the last scenario yet...but I suspect it will be quite difficult solo.

bifur/bilbo(lore) for support and dwarfs (eowyn) for spiritsupport/questing/rohan and zigil and leadership gloin or dain or theodred( could be the rohan-staging-attacker) for stweard of gondor and balins song and more carddraw.

its just too easy to run straight trough the quest cause you can draw cards like hell and a impressive mass of willpower and threatmanipulation....

with my setup i start with 25 threat and get so much money and cards for pump everything out too fast.

 

i dont like not playing existing cards, cause its not MY job to balance the game.

So far only have beaten the first quest in 3rd or 4th attempt due to lack of time ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

2 players: We first tried to choose Dwarves only for heroes. My wife played Leadership/Spirit and I played Tacitcs/Lore with all the Eagles in my deck. We failed 2 times, until we swapped the Spirit Dwarf (Bifur?) for Eowen, and won . Still not an easy victory though. So, imo, the difficulty shown for this quest isn't correct.

Let's see how it will turn out for the other quests.

btw, I don't get why people spend money on this game where one of the greatest aspects ist to build your own deck and strategy, come to the forums and simply copy deck's of other players...just to win?  Sorry, epic fail imo ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

I do think that you ought to try and do all 3 Quests with the same heroes; makes sense thematically imo.

y and doesnt make a difference.... in all 3 quest i fight like against 1-2 times maximum...mass willpower + threatreduce is really bit too easy....
