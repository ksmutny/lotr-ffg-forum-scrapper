i remember this being asked just after the games release, it didnt turn up much so i thought id give it another go....is there anywhere that has a subscription available for adventure packs in say, 6 or 12 month payments...this would suit me ideally as i never have the money as they come out, so i usually have to hunt the backlog down to give as birthday/ christmas present ideas. but a subscription gift card...now there's an idea. i think alot of people would go for this, i mean you can with MMORPGs, and various other stuff. anyways just me pondering....

no, but they should have this option for their card games.. I would use it.
