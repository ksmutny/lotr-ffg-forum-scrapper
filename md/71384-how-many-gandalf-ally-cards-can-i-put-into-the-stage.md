 There are two kinds of them. On the card it doesnt say anything about this.

 Both are named Gandalf and are unique. So you can have 3 in your deck and one on the table.

 Thank you. Why only one of each on the table? What about other ally cards? Same rules?

gandalf is unique- you can tell unique cards by the little circle they have before their name.

this means only one of each unique card in play at a time, this applies to all unique cards, even attatchments such as celebrians stone
