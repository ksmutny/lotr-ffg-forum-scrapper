2 questions came up with Rhudaur and I wanted to make sure I played it right.

1. If Balin cancels a shadow card and the deck is empty, do you shuffle to deal another shadow?

2. Similarly, if Seal the Tomb is in play and I have to discard the top 3 encounter cards at the end of the round, but the deck is empty, do I shuffle then?

3. Regardless of the answer to 2, I should still reveal the topmost Undead enemy from the encounter discard, since it's not an if/then clause, correct?

Thanks for your time!

Unless otherwise specified, the encounter deck only reshuffles when empty during the quest phase.
