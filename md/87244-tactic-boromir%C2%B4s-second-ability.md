Hi,

 

all player´s I asked about his second ability did not agree to my opinion...

So I finally ask the public.

 

Action: Discard Boromir to deal 2 damage to each enemy engaged with a single player.

 

The question is, if "with a single player" means all players or only one?

There is no "choose a player", so i think all enemies outside of the staging area are targeted.

It´s of course a big difference...

single player is only 1. so you choose a player (even though it says you dont) and then each enemy engaged with that player takes the hit. i do see where you are coming from though, but taking the card literally, single cannot mean more than 1 player, therefore you have to choose

Thanks for you´re answer.

 

I don´t know what the developer wanted...but why it should be written in an other form than normally if it is the same meaning?

 

Single player is surely 1...but i have to mention that there is at least 1 enemy (Durin´s Bane), which is engaged with all players at the same time.

So maybe the word "single" only exclude such enemies.

 

I´m not just jet convinced. -_- [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sleep.png]

personally i think you are reading into it too much ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] . we know from previous erratas that the designers sometimes use wordings they later wish they hadnt, and from the faq we know that some rules sentences are worded differently but mean the same (i need to check to get that one for you)
