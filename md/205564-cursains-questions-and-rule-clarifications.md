19th March 2016: Will "Favor of the Valar" actually work if "Troll Lair" is in the staging area?  My guess is No.

 

18th March 2016:  After shadow cards are dealt, and players are able to take actions before declaring defenders, what happens if I use "Stand and Fight" to bring a "Dunedain Hunter" on the board?  Would the newly engaged enemy be dealt a shadow card or have the ability to attack that round?  Would the newly engaged enemy be able to attack during the player portion of combat, when I can attack with my characters if I play "Stand and FIght" then?

 

15th March 2016:  Can I use "Thror's Map" to make "Rhosgobel" the active location during stage 1B of the quest?

 

15th March 2016:  In a two player game vs. "Hunt for Gollum" encounter deck, player A has a clue card on one of his heroes, and has encountered "Hunter's of Mordor". 

Player B doesn't have a clue card currently. 

Player B uses "Beregond" to defend the "Hunter's of Mordor" attack.  The shadow card revealed is "The West Bank".  Is the base attack strength of "Hunter's of Mordor" doubled or is the attack considered against player A?

 

24th February 2016:  If I have three "Mirkwood Runners" in play, can I attack a monster three separate times with each "Mirkwood Runner" so I can use their ability to cancel the armour of the monster?

-- Answer = No.  Each enemy can only be attacked once by each player, each combat round.

1.  Yes, unless there has been an errata for this.

 

 

2.  From the FAQ (1.52) "The defending player":

 

> When an enemy makes an attack against a player, or a character controlled by a player, that player is “the defending player” regardless of whose character is declared as a defender. Card effects, including shadow card effects, that target “the defending player” or “you” still target the player who the enemy is attacking even if another player declares one of his characters as a defender for that attack.

 

In your example, the Hunters from Mordor would only do four damage.  It has 2 natural attack and it would get +2 attack from one clue card being in play, but its attack would not double from shadow card since Player A is being attacked and has at least 1 Clue card attached.

Thank you cmabr002.  I somehow missed this in the FAQ.  Note-to-self, don't read FAQ at or near midnight, or when tired.

A) Uncertain, maybe someone else will chime in.

B) No, the Hunter's enemy will not be able to attack since it missed the framework event that makes it attack, if you Stand and Fight after defending all attacks.

If the enemy engages you after shadow cards are dealt, but before enemy attacks are resolved, as you describe, then the enemy will not get a shadow card, but will still attack. Enemies are given shadow cards if they make extra attacks, such as an immediate attack when revealed during questing. In your case, however, it would not get a shadow card.

You also have an action window after enemy attacks but before you attack. You could use stand and fight at such a point to bring an enemy in. It would not attack and then you could attack and kill it. Similar tricks are used when pulling enemies from the staging area. That is why tireless hunters specifically prevents this.

If you play Stand and Fight after shadow cards are dealt, put a Dunedain Hunter into play and engage an enemy out of the encounter deck:

 

-The enemy will not get a shadow card

-It will still attack normally.  However, you could wait until enemies attacks are finished, and *then* play Stand and Fight, and the enemy will not get an attack.

-If you want to be able to use the Dunedain Hunter to attack, you just need to play Stand and Fight anytime before you would declare an attack.  As long as he Hunter is on the table and ready, he can participate in an attack you've declared against an enemy engaged with you.
