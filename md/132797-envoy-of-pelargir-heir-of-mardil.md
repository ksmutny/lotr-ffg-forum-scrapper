How did I/we miss that combo? Granted, it's still one of those combos that will probably happen in the planning phase where readying is least useful, but for heroes like Denethor and Galadriel who use exhausting abilities during planning, this is great!

As is Squire of the Citadel + Heir of Mardil, albeit only for Gondor heroes.

How about Errand Rider? Throw down Heir of Mardil anywhere on the board, and you have an on-demand ready.

And Bifur is the natural combo with this Heir of Mardil...

He would be, if he were Noble :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png] That makes it harder.

Harder, yes. But not impossible thanks to the Noble Hero boon. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

My bad... You are totally right... Miss the "Attach to a Noble hero" part...

Bofur Spirit + Horn of Gondor.

It's easier with Theodred. It will ready the hero with heir of mardil as soon as he commits to the quest.

Which will probably be him as committing to the quest wastes his natural 2 attack.

I hate Theodred, though. Even if you ready him he doesn't have great stats and he doesn't have any traits or specialties that make raising his combat stats easy. If you use Heir of Mardil on him, you essentially just get 1 free resource on him and 1 free willpower added to the quest. The only cost is associated with getting Heir of Mardil into play, and the fact that other than the resource and single point of willpower, you wasted a hero on Theodred.

 

I'd much prefer a stronger alternate hero and using the other means of activating Heir of Mardil.

I still think it's best on Theoden, especially when combined with The Day's Rising.  Add in a Steed of the Mark and he can quest, defend, and attack and use all of his high stats.  The Day's Rising pays for Steed of the Mark, so it's a net zero cost (not counting the cost to play the cards in the first place).

I made a similar note on TftC for the Antlered Crown hero review. Theoden is the only hero to have all the traits/keywords required to play Captain of Gondor, Heir of Mardil, The Day's Rising, AND Steed of the Mark. Throw on Steward of Gondor and Gondorian Shield too to make him able to quest for 3, defend for 5, and attack for 4 all on the same turn. And now that he has the Gondor trait you could even bump his willpower up with Visionary Leadership too. As sad as Theoden was at first, he is shaping up to be quite the powerhouse. He doesn't have a cool/fun/powerful ability, but his numbers and actions per turn can get pretty ridiculous.

Oh help,and then have this guy lead a batallion of outlanders with Fangorn. Poor Sauron...

I had been putting it on Elrond in a Vilya deck and using Theodred to ready him and help fuel the big guys I drew.

Yes. Elrond is one of the heroes that I thought of early on because he has an ability that is usually triggered during preparation. Galadriel and Denethor are my other favorites here.
