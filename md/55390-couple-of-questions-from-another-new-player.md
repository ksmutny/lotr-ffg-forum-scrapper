Hey everyone,

started playing this game and really enjoying it! Couple of questions to clarify certain things:

1. At the last page of the rule book (turn schedule) it shows when to play an action, but at the same time
it says at the top actions may be played during the green phases. Does it mean that I can execute an action 
whenever I want during an green phase?

2. How many actions may a player use during a action opportunity?

3. Is there a way for attachments to be replaced on other heros/characters while there is nothing on the card
saying that it is possible (for example: citadel plate)?

4. Are eagles as well 'characters', since the card says creature?

5. (Think its clear, some topics made me confused) Is defending allowed with more then 1 character
against a single attack (the same you can attack with multiple characters against an enemy)?

Thanks for reading and helping!

1. You can play actions before/after any step and you can play actions DURING any green step.

2. As many as you want (and can afford to pay for).

3. Do you mean replaced with another attachment or do you meant moved to another character? You can place as many non-restricted attachments on a hero as you want. You can also place up to 2 restricted attachments. You cannot move attachments between characters unless you have a specific card effect that allows it.

4. All allies and heroes are characters.

5. You may only defend with a single character. You may not do a combined defense except as allowed by specific card effects (such as Stand Together).

Welcome to the game :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

1. Pretty much, yes.

2. As many as he/she wants.

3. Are you asking about if it is possible to move an attachment from one character to another?  If so, then not really.  Some attachments have the ability to do this (Dunedain ___ comes to mind), but otherwise there's no way to do this.

4.  Characters are Heroes or Allies.  Creature is a trait, much like Hobbit, Orc, Silvan, Item, Condition.  Traits have no effect on the rules unless a card refers to them.  Since an Eagle is an Ally, it is a Character.

5.Stand Together is the only card that lets you do this.  Normally, if you defend an attack, you can only defend with one character.
